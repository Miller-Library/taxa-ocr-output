Inorganic copper and mercury, at concentrations as
low as a half part per million in sed water, reduced
photosynthesis in samples of Porphyrd perfordtd. Simildr
effects were observed in phytoplankton using even lower
concentrations of copper in solution. Neither the mercuric
or cupric ions indicated any effects on plant respiration
nor gny signs of synergistic action as inhibitors of photo¬
synthesis in Porphyrg.

Introduction:
Negligence in disposal of complex industrial effluent
has stimulated studies on the biological processes of
accumulation of trace elements in organisms and the physio¬
logical effects of these elements on marine life. Bowen
(1966) reported that brown algae concentrate copper to
levels ground 11 parts per million and mercury to .03
parts per million. Goldberg (1963) recorded the natural
levels of these metals in the open sed. Copper ranges from
between 3 to 10 parts per billion while mercury is present
at levels about .2 parts per billion. Ihis represents
approximately a hundred fold increase in mercury concen¬
trations and at least a thousand fold increase in copper
concentrations. Studies on the effects of trace elements
on photosynthesis have been done recently on populations
of marine phytoplankton. Harriss, White, and MacFarlane
(1970) demostrated the relative toxicity of organomer-
curial fungicides on photosynthesis of the marine diatom
Nitzschig delicatissimg and a naturally occuring phyto-
plankton population taken from a fresh water lake. These
mercurial compounds reduced photosynthesis by at least 50%
at concentrations of one part per billion. Steemann Nielsen
and Wium-Andersen (1970) observed similar inhibition in
the photosynthesis of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chlorella pyrenoidosa : Exact'>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</span> and Nitzchig
paleg with cupric ion concentrations as low as five parts
per billion.
Benthic algae are important producers of nutrient material

for marine organisms in coastal intertidal and subtidal
communities. Although they represent only a small fraction
of the total marine primary production, the bulk of coastal
productivity is effected by the attached plants (Gilmartin, 1969).
The benthic algae are important in terms of producing detritus
material used for food by marine invertebrates. Other species,
notably the brown algae, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>Macrocystis,</span> serve as the primary
food of larvae forms of fish. For these reasons, the effects
of ionic copper and mercury on benthic algae productivity and
respiration were investigated. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porphyra perforata : Exact'>Porphyra perforata,</span> a red algde
common to the Monterey Peninsula, was used as the experimental
subject. This species of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Rhodophyta : Exact'>Rhodophyta</span> is found in the uppermost
level of the intertidal zone and is capable of surviving 24-48
hours out of water. It has a broad monstromatic thallus
which is easily identified by its deeply rullfed margins,
brown-purple coloration, and disc-shaped holdfast (Smith, 1944).
Its hardiness and egsy identifiable characteristics make this
algae a convenient experimental subject.
Materials and Methods:
P. perforatg was collected on the middle reef of Moss
Beach (35°36 42 N, 121°56 42 W) located on the western
exposed coast line of the Monterey Peninsulg. This point
is situgted between Point Joe and Point Pinos. This collection
site was selected because of the abundance of P. perforato
in the vicinity. In addition, the turbulent wave action
of the region constantly brings in open ocean water, which
presumably has lower concentrations of trace elements, in shore.

Samples were collected during the late morning hours and
kept in seg water until utilized. All samples were used
on the same day as collected. Crossections (approximately
12.5 cm) were taken from the thalli using a nonmetallic
punch. Sea water, drawn 100 meters off the coast of Point
Cabrillo (Hopkins Marine Station) from the surface and collected
in polyester plastic containers, was filtered through
Whatman GF/C filter paper to remove particulate matter and
phytoplankton. This water was used to make up different concen¬
trations of metallic ions in solution. Plant samples were
incubated in the solutions and left undistrubed in 125 ml B.O.D.
glass stopper bottles for 224 hours in a water bath set at
151.5°C and at a constant light intensity of 450 foot-candles.
In order to measure the rate of photosynthesis and respiration,
both "light" bottles, in which the plant material is illumingted,
and "dark" bottles, in which the bottles were wrapped with
alumium foil and light was not allowed to reach the plant,
were used. In the light bottles both photosynthesis and respira¬
tion could occur. In the dark bottles only the process of
respiration would be active since photosynthesis depends on
light to act as an energy source to initial activity.
At the end of the initial incubation period, samples
were removed from the light. Water in the bottles was
drained off and deoxygenated water containing identical
metal concentrations was replaced. Samples were replaced
in incubation for 1 hours. Plant material was then removed
and dissolved oxygen measured by the Winkler method as described
by Carpenter (1965). Factors were introduced into Carpenter's
24
O
original equation to correct for differences in sample
bottle volumes and the volume of the plant material.
The initial oxygen concentrations in the deoxygenated
sea water was subtracted from the values obtained after
incubation to determine the change in oxygen concentrations
due to photosynthesis and respiration. The plant material
was dried at 80°c for two hours and weighed on tared aluminum
discs. Oxygen production was calculated in terms of milli-
liters of oxygen per gram dried weight. Estimates of the
relative rates of gross photosynthesis were measured by
adding the values of milliliters of oxygen produced in the
light bottles to the values of oxygen consumed in respiration
as indicated from the dark bottles.
As a comparison study, a test was made with phytoplankton
to examine the effects of different concentrations of copper
ions in solution. Phytoplankton samples were collected
at CalcOFI station 3, located above the Monterey Canyon,
in the middle of Monterey Bay, while aboard Hopkins Marine
Station's ocegnographic research vessel Proteus. Surface
water containing phytoplankton was collected and innoculated with
different copper solutions and five microcuries of radioactive
carbon-14. Samples were incubated in 125 ml glass stopper
bottles for 3 hours at 14°C with a constant light intensity
(2.5 millivolts on a photocell). Samples were then filtered
through .45 micron millipore filters and carbon uptake
measured with a gas-flow detector proportional counter,
Nuclear-Chicago model D-47. The number of discharges recorded
per minute served as rate indicators for photosynthesis.

the control samples.
Results:
Tables 1-3 depict milliliters of oxygen produced per
gram dry weight of plant material when exposed to increasing
concentrations of metallic cations. Table I shows the mean
values for gross photosynthesis when copper, as cupric nitrate,
was used. Variance, standard deviations, and the number of
trials for each experiment are also listed. Table II expresses
the same information for gross photosynthesis in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. perforata</span>
under varying concentrations of mercury, in the form of mercuric
chloride. Table III indicates the results obtained when both
Cu'Y and Hg' were introduced into solution at equal concentra¬
tions.
Tables IV-VI show the results of the relative respiratory
rates. Table IV relates copper concentrations to milliliters
of oxygen consumed by the plant during the 1 hour incubation
period. Table V corresponds to the mercury concentrations while
Table VI indicates the effects of the two metals together in
solution.
Table VII contains the results of the phytoplankton
productivity experiment. Different concentrations of copper
ions in the phytoplankton suspensions produced a decrease
in primary productivity as indicated by the counts per minute

Discussion
P. perforata, when exposed to a Cu concentration of
1000 ug/liter, exhibited about a 42% reduction in photosyn¬
thesis (as calculated from the mean values). Standard
devidtions indicate at least a 68% probability that repression
of photosynthesis is occurring (Fig. I). Mercury concen¬
trations (Fig. II) exhibit 35% inhibition at 500 ug/liter
(68% probability) and complete inhibition at 1000 ug/liter
(99% probability). It is interesting to note that this
latter dose was not lethal and plant respiration still
occurred (Figs. II and IV). When copper and mercury ions were
added to solution in equal concentrations (Fig. III),
productivity at 500 pg/liter represented only 21% of the
value obtained from the control samples (99% probability).
Although this decrease is greater at this concentration
that those indicated in the other trials, it must be
reiterated that the cupric and mercuric ions were both
present in solution at a concentration of 500 ug/liter,
There is no indication from this data that the mercury and
copper ions act together synergisticly to inhibit photosynthesis.
Although an insufficient number of trials were performed
to determine, with any statistical validity, the effects
of these metallic ions on plant respiration, dark bottle
trials (Fig. IV) do not show any significant inhibiting
or enhancing effects. More precise measurements and g.
greater number of experimental trials would be necessary
to determine whether or not these trace elements affect
the respiratory mechanisms.

As pointed out by Mandelli (1969), cellular material
consists of organic macromolecules which contain phosphate,
amino, carboxyl, and sulfhydryl groups which can act as parts
of regctive sites on enzymes. Strong electronegative
metallic cations, such as copper and mercury, when added to
algal cultures in concentrations which exceed metabolic
requirements, may form strong chemical bonds with these
groups. These reactions could inactivate enzymes and have
gdverse effects on cellular metabolism, transport, and synthesis.
Copper and mercury ions could be affecting the photosynthetic
enzymes in a similar manner or be reducing the cells' materidl
transport systems and the supply of raw materials to the
chloroplasts.
Steeman Nielsen and Wium-Andersen (1970) showed that
copper reduced photosynthesis in the diatom Nitzchid poled
70% and in the green algae <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chlorella : Exact'>Chlorella</span> pyrenoidosd approximately
25% at copper concentrations of 10 ug/liter. Data collected
here at Hopkins Marine Station indicate about 15% reduction
in photosynthesis. Phytoplankton, then, is affected in
photosynthesis by concentrations of copper ions one to two
orders of magnitude less than are needed to produce simildr
effects in P. perforata, a red benthic algde. One explandtion
for this resistence might be found by comparing the structure
and physiological properties of plant cell walls. According
to Smith (1944) the thallus of P. perforata ranges ip thick-
ness from 45 to 140 microns. The single loyer of ellpsoiddl
cells within this structure range in length from 40 to 100 microns.
Ihe cell walls separating the cytoplasm from the external
C
O
environment would then consitute a matrix layer between 2.5
to 20 microns thick. In Porphyrg, the cell wall consists
primarily of the polysaccharides xylose and mannan (Kreger,1962).
The polysaccharide fibrils contain many of the same chemical
groups mentioned previously in conjuction with organic enzymes
and have been shown to exhibit an affinity for strongly electro¬
negative cations (Bonner and Varner, 1965). Thick cell
walls, then, might absorb metallic ions. Bowen (1966)
pointed out that brown algae concentrates copper as much
as to 11 parts per million. Large concentrations of metallic
cations in the external environment might be necessary to
cause significant repression of the photosynthetic enzymes
in benthic algae.
Bowen also listed data which indicates that phytoplankton
samples,consisting primarily of diatoms, concentrate copper
to levels as high as 200 parts per million. Despite these
high levels, the diatoms are far more sensitive to low concen¬
trations of copper than are benthic algae. Although silica is
an essential constituent of diatiom cell walls, the primary
component is pectin (Fritsch, 1948), a colloidal carbo¬
hydrate which contains a large proportion of anhydrogalacturonic
acid. The carboxyl groups of polygalacturonic acids also
show an attraction for metallic cations. Since the cell wall
surface to cytoplasmic volume ratio is greater in digtoms
than in Porphyrg, it seems physically possible that digtoms
could be concentrating metallic ions at higher levels than
benthic algae in the same gquatic environment. Since thick
siliceous walls would shut off the cytoplasm from the environ¬
29
O
C
O
ment, many species of diatoms have developed direct connections
between the cytoplasm and the external environment by means
of pores in the cell wall or the raphe in some digtoms (Fritsch,
1948). Direct contact between the cytoplasm and the water
might allow metallic cations to flow past the cell wall and
affect cellular enzymatic systems directly. Diatoms may,
then, concentrate trace metals at higher levels than does
P. perforata yet remain more sensitive to low concentrations
of these toxicants. It is interesting to note that Chlorello
pyrenoidosg, the green microalgde, is less inhibited in its
photosynthesis than is Nitzchig paled, a marine diatom, at
equal concentrations of copper (Steeman Nielsen and Wium¬
Andersen, 1970).
Additional physical factors, such as the greater surface
areg to volume ratio, might also be facilitating material
entry into phytoplankton. Other metabolic processes might
explain this selective sensitivity in other, non-physical,
terms.
Wave action and currents, important aids in diffusion
properties of dissolved materials, might also increase productiv¬
ity or metallic cation entry into benthic algde. In a
natural system, concentrations of dissolved metallic ions
would remain at constant levels as currents would help in the
diffusion of these ions to greas where plant material might
be absorbing them. These conditions were not simulated in
the benthic algae experiments and might play an important role
in increasing inhibitory effects.
The Monterey Bay area, located on the Pacific coast off
30
O
of central Californig, is an upwelling region which supports
high levels of primary production (Ryther, 1969). High
productivity maintains abundant quantities and diversity of
marine florg and faung. Contamination of this ared due to
mineral runoff and industrial effluent might contribute
significant amounts of mercury, copper, and other inorganic
and organic waste. Prelimingry productivity experiments
done at Hopkins Marine Station have indicated that cadmium
ions in solution influence productivity in natural phyto¬
plankton populations as well.
Benthic algge and phytoplankton are subjected to marine
pollutants over ocegnic seasons and long term exposure might
increase inhibition of photosynthesis at low concentrations,
damaging internal cellular enzymes systems, decreasing
productivity capacities. Selective toxic stress might
alter species composition of the algde populations and
produce florg imbalance. Upsetting the primary producer
tropic levels can have drastic influences on the ecological
balance and stability of the coastal marine communities.
