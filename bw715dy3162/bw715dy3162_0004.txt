capabilities (Fig 1). Animals show three distinct classes of response.
The most common class is defined waves of light moving across
darkness. Often, one portion a few square centimeters in area
remains excited for several seconds before this excitation migrates
gradually, saltates to another area, or ceases entirely. However, in
some animals, excited areas luminesce continuously with waves of
greater intensity moving within the glowing area. One Pannychia has
primarily small spots flashing rather than patches of light.
Wave front shapes
Whatever the class of response, the wave fronts form
characteristic shapes as well as complex patterns (Fig. 2). One shape
appears in the same location up to 15 times before the excitation
evolves and the pattern disrupts. In general, the direction of
propagation remains constant during repetitive waves; however, on
one occasion we observed a reversal of wave direction while the
wave shape and location remained unchanged. All wave shapes
annihilate upon collision (Fig. 3). Annihilation is the abrupt loss of
the intensity that occurs when two wave fronts approach each
other's refractory region.
Circular waves spread out from a single pulsing point. Circular
waves sometimes evolve into spiral waves with period 0.42 +- 0.04
s. Propagating waves consist of wave fronts moving in a defined
direction. These waves move most often along the radial nerve cords
and have curved or straight wave front shapes. Propagating waves
occasionally jump from one nerve cord to the other. Some waves
display dark bands perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
