non-invasive studies, although limited, may give important insights
into neural activity as a naturally occurring process rather than as a
result of experimental manipulation. The pacemaker neurons
mediating the repetitive waves of stimulation may eventually be
isolated by examining the innervation of the light-producing cells;
however, for now, intact animals provide initial insights into the
properties of the pacemaker neuron.
Materials and Methods
Pannychia were collected by the remotely operated vehicle
Ventana aboard the ship Point Lobos in the Monterey Bay from 550
to 900 meters in depth. The organisms were transferred to
Rubbermaid containers along with the mud that was grasped in the
collection process. We stored the containers in holding tanks
maintained at 5 C for the duration of the experiments. At least once
a week we replaced the sea water in the containers. We fed the
Pannychia nothing and exposed them only to red-filtered light.
Approximately once every three days, we filmed each animal.
We transferred the Pannychia to butter dishes full of sea water at
least 1/2 hour before filming. We used a Cohu Silicon Intensified
Tube (SIT) camera to capture both images illuminated obliquely with
an unfiltered flashlight and images of luminescence with no
background lighting. We stimulated the animals mechanically with a
glass rod.
We transferred images from videotape to optical disk using an
OMDR. We then analyzed the images using Megavision. Images
included in this paper were captured by scanning single frames from
