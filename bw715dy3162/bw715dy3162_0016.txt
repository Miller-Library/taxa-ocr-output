Figure Captions
Figure 1: The waves have dark spots because the papillae do not
luminesce.
Figure 2: Common shapes of waves.
a) A circular wave on the left-hand side of the luminescence,
single frame.
b) A spiral wave, single frame.
c) A propagating wave, accumulation of 20 frames.
Figure 3: Annihilation
a) The wave fronts in the upper right approach each other,
single frame.
b) Three frames later, the wave fronts are just about to collide.
c) Four frames later, the intensity of hte colliding wave fronts
has almost disappeared.
Figure 4: Dark bands, accumulation of 20 frames. Patches between
papillae sometimes show faint lighting (purple dots).
Figure 5: The large arrow represents the overall direction of
decomposable waves. The small arrows represent the
individual wavelets that create the decomposable effect.
Wavelet 1 fires just before wavelet 2, followed by 3 then 4 as
the excitation propagates in the direction of the large arrow.
Figure 6: The dependence of speed of propagation on period. Each
point represents the average speed and average period for a
single bioluminescent response.
Figure 7: Comparison of the space constant X for curved and straight
wave fronts.
Figure 8: Comparison of the speed of propagation of bioluminescence
in normal sea water and in high magnesium chloride.
Figure 9: Comparison of the period between waves in normal sea
water and in high magnesium chloride.
Figure 10: Luminescence stops abruptly at the first cut in a double
transection of the radial nerve, single frame.
