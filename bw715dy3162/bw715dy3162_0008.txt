not display such polarity. The tail of the Ptychodera flava (Baxter
and Pickens, 1964), a luminescent system controlled by nerve nets, is
also more sensitive to stimulation than the rest of the body.
The decomposable waves along the radial nerve involve
transmission of an impulse along the nerve cord that excites the
nerve net locally. Hence the signal has an overall longitudinal
direction as the radial nerve triggers sequential impulses to spread
transversely through the nerve net. This hypothesis is supported by
the relative velocities of the longitudinal and transverse parts. The
26.8 cm/s speed measured for the longitudinal part approaches the
conduction velocity of 55 cm/s in an ophiuroid radial nerve (Yee et
al., 1987). However, the 7.06 cm/s velocity of the transverse waves
is similar to nerve net conduction speeds in other organisms. Pantin
reported velocities of 10-20 cm/s for lateral conduction in
coelenterate nerve nets (1935).
The complexity of bioluminescent waves is based on the
interplay between pattern and randomness. Studying intensity in an
excitation area through time often shows that each point retraces the
same pattern of intensity with each repetition of the wave. However,
one cannot predict whether a pattern will repeat twice or twenty
times or where the excitation will migrate next. Waves tend to
retrace their predecessor's paths because of facilitation. Facilitation
occurs in nerve nets when each impulse eases the passage of
subsequent impulses. The radial nerve is most likely responsible for
the saltation of an excitation area, whereas migration of excitation
areas suggests facilitation. Facilitation enables migration because
