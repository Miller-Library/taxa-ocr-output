optical disk or overlaying and averaging up to 20 frames. We
measured speed of propagation, space constant, and period of the
waves.
In some experiments, we altered the concentration of
magnesium chloride in the environment by mixing ratios of normal
sea water and isotonic magnesium chloride in the butter dish. We
ran experiments at 1 to 2, 1 to 5, and 1 to 7 isotonic magnesium
chloride to normal sea water ratios. We let the animal acclimate in
the high magnesium for 45 minutes before filming.
In other experiments, we transected the radial nerve in living
Pannychia. Using scissors, we snipped through the outer layer of the
animal about five centimeters from the caudal tip. In cutting the
nerve cord, we also cut epithelial layers around the nerve. In one
animal, we made two transections in a single radial nerve spaced one
centimeter apart.
Results
General appearance of bioluminescence
When prodded gently with a glass rod, Pannychia display a
complex pattern of luminescence. I use the word wave to describe
the propagation of a patch of light on the body surface. An area of
excitation consists of a section of the body that contains any number
of waves of luminescence. One response refers to all the excitations
caused by a single prodding.
Only the dorsal surface of the animal luminesces. The caudal
end of the animal responds more frequently regardless of stimulus
location. The papillae on the dorsal surface have no light-producing
