These dark bands consist of dark spots located at the base of the
papillae as well as patches connecting these spots. In some waves
with dark bands, a colorized frame from optical disk shows that
patches connecting the dark papillae spots are in fact faintly
illuminated (Fig 4).
Some propagating waves are what I term decomposable. In
decomposable waves, the overall direction of propagation appears to
be longitudinal; however, the excitation is actually a series of small
waves transverse to the radial nerve (Fig 5).
Quantitative analysis of propagating waves
The mean conduction velocity is 16.8 + 8.8 cm/s.
Measurements of the conduction velocity of individual waves range
from 5.18 to 40.3 cm/s. Even within a single animal, the velocity
typically varies 10 cm/s or more between different locations on the
body. For each measurement, we print a line on the monitor and
watch the waves in slow motion until both observers agree that the
line accurately reflects the direction of propagation of the wave. If
the line is not acceptable, either we correct the line and re-run the
analysis or we find alternate waves to measure. The image processor
plots the intensity at points along the line through time. We also
reject any readings whose scans through time do not have a definite
slope of maximum intensity. We aim for a total of ten or more
velocity readings along at least four different wave fronts for each
stimulation transferred to optical disk, but sometimes only one or
two velocity readings are acceptable.
