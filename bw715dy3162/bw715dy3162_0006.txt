Velocities from decomposable waves are not included in
averages and other analysis because their direction of wave
propagation is not clearly defined. For one such excitation, the radial
portion has speed 26.8 +10.7 cm/s. The transverse wavelets have
a mean conduction velocity of 7.06 +2.1 cm/s.
The period between repetitive waves ranges from 0.33 to 0.69
s with a mean of 0.50 + 0.09 s. Figure 6 shows the dispersion
relation, defined as the dependence of conduction velocity on period.
The points consist of averages of all the velocity and period readings
from a single stimulation. Waves that do not repeat at least three
times are not included in this analysis.
The space constant l, defined as the distance between the
maximum intensity and the leading edge of the wave front, averages
0.037 + 0.016 cm. The space constant is greater when the wave
front is curved rather than straight (Fig. 7). The curved and straight
velocities are statistically different (Mann-Whitney U-test, p«0.01).
Magnesium chloride vs. normal sea water experiments
Adding magnesium chloride at a ratio of 1/3 isotonic
magnesium chloride to 2/3 normal sea water to the Pannychia's
environment blocks all luminescence. Lower ratios increase the
threshold of the organism so that only stimuli of greater magnitudes
cause luminescence. The conduction velocity is not conclusively
altered by magnesium chloride (Fig. 8). The period between waves
increases in the high magnesium chloride experiments (Fig. 9). The
normal and magnesium periods are significantly different (Mann¬
Whitney U-test, p«0.05).
