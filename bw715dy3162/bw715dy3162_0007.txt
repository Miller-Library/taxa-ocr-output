Trends and velocities in transection studies
Transection of the radial nerve can block the spread of
luminescence (Fig. 10). When a nerve cord is cut once and the
animal is stimulated ipsilateral and rostral to the cut, most of the
luminescence remains rostral to the cut, often with a marked wall at
the site of the lesion. Large responses can sneak around the cut, but
do not usually propagate far. A double transection of the same nerve
cord effectively blocks all transmission of luminescence caudal to the
lesion. The response to an ipsilateral stimulus in the tail does move
rostral to the double cut. Contralateral rostral stimuli do propagate
caudal to the single and double transections. The mean velocity of
responses in transected animals is 15.5 +1.3 cm/s.
Discussion
The patterns of response in Pannychia suggest control by nerve
nets as well as signaling by radial nerves. The average diffusion
constant DÃ§=vA for the Pannychia luminescence was 5.8E+9 u2/s.
Molecules diffuse at a maximum rate of 1000 u2/s in aqueous
solutions (Meyer, 1991); hence, the luminescent waves cannot be
account for by molecular diffusion. Modeling neural activity as the
diffusion of charge, Meyer calculated a diffusion coefficient of
6.7E+10 u2/s for a giant squid axon (1991). Because long-distance
voltage diffusion occurs only in the nervous system, the quickly
diffusing bioluminescence in Pannychia must be under neural
control. The tendency of the caudal end to luminesce more readily
also suggest neural control, for molecular diffusion generally would
