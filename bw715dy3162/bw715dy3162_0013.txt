Acknowledgments
Thank you
to Edge, for studying the silent scream with me, for
measuring my kneecaps, and for making all those long nights fun.
to Stuart, for both giving advice and holding back so I could
think for myself.
to Sam, for teaching me those things a real physics major
should know.
to Molly, for advice, friendship, and good luck head-rubs.
to Chuck, for the Pannychia and the wise words.
to Chris, for all-around help and for good advice on my
presentation.
to Erin, Jay, Ildiko, and Adawia, for making me feel welcome
whenever I actually appeared during the day.
