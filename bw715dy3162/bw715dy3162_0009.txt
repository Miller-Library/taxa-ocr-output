impulses travel slightly farther than previous impulses, leading to an
overall extension or movement in the direction of wave propagation.
The transection experiments support the idea that radial and
nerve nets mediate different modes of evolution of excitation. When
excitation cannot travel through the radial nerve, luminescence
migrates rather than saltates. A double cut presents a greater block
to luminescence than a single cut by forcing the waves to travel
through greater lengths of the decremental facilitated nerve net. The
radial nerves work independently of each other to respond to local
stimuli, since ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation had different
effects. The nerve cords can communicate, however, for excitation in
non-transected animals can jump from one nerve cord to the other.
Using bioluminescence as a monitor of neural activity, we can
describe some properties of the Pannychia nerve net. The range of
conduction velocities between 5 and 40 cm/s is consistent with
neural conduction speeds. The wide range of velocities is due to two
main experimental errors: the decrease in normal speed for a curved
wave front and the difference in conduction speeds in waves
controlled by radial nerves and by nerve nets. Even so, Brehm
reported a range of 10 to 85 cm/s for bioluminescent propagation in
an ophiuroid (1977). An area of nerve net characterized more by
interneural facilitation than by through-conduction should have a
lower velocity (Pantin, 1935). Different paths of spread might
involve more synapses; hence, synaptic delay may decrease velocity.
Therefore, even if the two experimental errors limiting appropriate
comparison were avoided, we would see a range of velocities.
