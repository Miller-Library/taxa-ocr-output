At extremely short periods, the conduction velocity of Pannychia
bioluminescence should decrease with decreasing period; however,
the theory is not sufficient to describe the dispersion relation at
naturally-occurring periods.
The regularity of the impulses suggest control by a pacemaker
neuron. Bullock proposes two theoretical mechanisms for
endogenous rhythms, oscillating circuits and pacemaker neurons, but
states that no rhythmic oscillatory circuits have been described in
invertebrates; therefore, the neural rhythm is probably set by
pacemaker neurons (1965). Most pacemakers have, when excited, an
inward current that gradually depolarizes the cell to threshold. At
threshold, the action potential is generated, followed by quick
repolarization. The repolarization returns the cell to its initial state
in which the inward current causes the cycle to recur. Because the
pulsing points that initiate bioluminescence can be located anywhere
on the dorsal surface of the animal and because several points may
be pulsing independently at the same time, the pacemaker neurons
are most likely diffusely spread throughout the nerve net.
The period of the pacemaker depends on the magnitude of the
inward current, the threshold voltage, and properties of the cell
membrane. A nerve cell with a constant current can be modeled as a
simple RC circuit (Jack et al., 1983). The equation V = IR(I-etR
describes the voltage during the charging of a capacitor. The time
required to reach threshold is therefore t =-RC*In(1 - Vth/IR).
Increasing the threshold voltage will therefore increase the period as
it takes longer for the cell to reach threshold voltage.
