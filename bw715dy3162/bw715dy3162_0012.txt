The conduction velocity in a nerve net is also related to the
threshold voltage for action potentials. If the threshold voltage is
higher, accumulating enough charge for the post-synaptic potential to
reach the threshold voltage will take longer. This increase in
synaptic delay will slow conduction through the nerve net. Since an
increase in threshold corresponds to both a larger period and a
slower speed, the dispersion relation determined experimentally
agrees with the properties of the pacemaker neurons.
The increase in period under high magnesium conditions
suggests that the pacemaker neuron is depolarized by a current
carried at least in part by calcium ions. Most pacemaker neurons
studied in invertebrates have currents carried by calcium ions. Most
pacemaker neurons studied in Aplysia (Gorman et al., 1982), Helix
(Gerschenfeldet al., 1986), Tritonia (Smith and Thompson, 1985), and
calf Purkinje cells (Kass, et al., 1978) all have calcium-dependent
pacemakers. In Aplysia, the channels are permeable to magnesium,
but the mean open time is shorter when magnesium replaces calcium
in the environment. Other calcium channels are impermeable to
magnesium. Since magnesium blocks or alters calcium channels, the
change in period at high magnesium concentrations indicates that
calcium channels are involved in the oscillation of the pacemaker
neuron.
