Because nerve nets act as excitable media, I thought the
neurally controlled bioluminescence might also be an excitable
medium. The existence of spiral waves and annihilation proves the
luminescence has a refractory period. Spiral waves exist because a
regular wave front such as a circular wave hits a region with
variable refractory periods, breaking the circle into a regular spiral
wave whose period depends on the refractory period. Waves
annihilate rather than pass through each other only in refractory
media. The absolute refractory period of the nerve net is necessarily
less than the minimum period observed between bioluminescent
pulses. Our maximum limit on the refractory period is 0.33 s, much
greater than the estimates for refractory periods in nerve nets of 40
to 65 ms (Pantin, 1935). The diffusion constant relationship often
applied to excitable media, De = vA, explains why A increases with
curvature, for normal velocity decrease for a curved wave front.
The dispersion relationship is a central equation describing
excitable media. Excitable media generally display an increase in
velocity with increasing period, for the medium is still in a relative
refractory period if the new wave is initiated too soon. The opposite
trend observed in this experiment suggest that the refractory period
is short enough that such slowing is not seen. The absolute
refractory period calculated by one model for calcium stores was 4.7
s, two orders of magnitude greater than the nerve net refractory
period (Lechleiter et al., 1991). Hence, this dispersion relation
predicted by theory (Gerhart et al., 1990) and verified
experimentally using the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction (Foerster et
al., 1989) may apply only to media excited by molecular diffusion.
