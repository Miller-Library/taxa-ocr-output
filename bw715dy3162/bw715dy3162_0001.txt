Abstract
Pannychia moseleyi exhibits waves of bioluminescence under
neural control. The mean speed of propagation of the luminescent
waves is 16.8 +- 8.8 cm/s. Excitation propagates both in the radial
nerves and in the nerve net, with respective conduction velocities of
31.9 cm/s and 7.1 cm/s. The bioluminescence acts as an excitable
medium; however, the dispersion relation predicted by excitable
media theory between conduction velocity and period is not
observed. Pacemakers controlling the bioluminescence have periods
between 0.33 and 0.69 s. The activity of these pacemakers may be
controlled by an inward calcium current because the period of the
pacemaker increases in high concentrations of magnesium.
Introduction
Pannychia moseleyi is a benthic holothurian that lives between
500 and 3000 meters of depth. Complex waves of bioluminescence
propagate swiftly across the organism's dorsal surface. The simplest
patterns within these waves were studied using excitable media
theory. An excitable medium is a refractory system with spatial
dimension in which adjacent sections are coupled so that a wave of
excitation can propagate (Winfree, 1986). Excitable media theory
successfully explains oscillations in chemical media, but extension of
the theory to inhomogeneous biological systems such as
bioluminescence in Pannychia may strengthen the possible
applications to cardiac contractions and nervous systems.
The easily-detected bioluminescence serves as a useful
reflection of neural activity that controls the luminescent waves. The
