When percentages from the bottom layer in each of five studies
are analyzed with respect to high tides occurring during the night (See
Figure 13), statistical significance is readily demonstrated. Here,
pair-wise t-tests of log-transformed means show expectations of random
occurrence of p £.02 (f-16) between valuas for the preceding low tide
versus the nocturnal high tide; similarly, expectations of random occur-
rence show p 2.03 (f-18) for the high versus the subsequent low tide,
whether that low occurs in darkness or during the first hours of daylight.
while statistical analyses verify the probability of a tidal component
in endogenous patterns of migration, elements of a diel component may
also be present. The similarity in shape of Figure 3-F to Figures
3 .-A,B,C,D,& E suggests a rise in percentage of animals occupying the
lowest layer after the onset of darkness, independent of high tides.
Additionally, all cases except 3 -D and 3 -E exhibit a decline in
values of the lowest layer shortly before dawn. The 5/24 and 5/25
studies (Figures :3'-D & 3 -E) were part of a 53-hour investigation in
which I was sampling only every six hours. Hence, I was not sampling at
a frequency which would have revealed low pre-dawn values had they
occurred. Thus, Figure 3 shows that darkness appears to have a pre-
dictable and additive effect on the tidal component of an endogenous
vertical migration pattern.
Laboratory studies undertaken to separate these components consisted
of imposing three-hour delayed light and tidal cycles to separate batches
of cores maintained independently under constant temperature conditions.
Two batches of five cores weré subjected to altered tidal conditions for
494 hours before sampling; results showed that this regimen was insuffi-
cient to produce migration behavior different from that expected in an
