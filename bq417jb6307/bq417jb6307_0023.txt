Figure Legend
Figure 1 - Replicate studies showing recurrence of endogenous
patterns in the top and bottom layer when tidal and
diel conditions repeat themselves.
Figure 1A- Percentages found in the 0-3" and 9-12" layers on May
4 & 5. Slender vertical bars indicate dawn or dusk;
arrows indicate high or low  tide.
Figure 1B- Percentage found in the top and bottom layers on May
20 & 21. Lines shown connect data points taken at the
same frequency as in Figure 1A.
Figure 2 - Percentage of core population in each layer through the
course of 24 hours. Shows variable trends in behavior
of second and third layer; these will be deleted in sub-
sequent graphs. Heavy vertical bar indicates power out-
age; data to the right not analyzed.
Figure 3 - A comparison of endogenous trends in the lowest layer
during night hours for six studies conducted between
May 4 and May 25. Note the occurrence of nocturnal
high tides in all but F. No high tide data point for B.

Figure 4 - An experiment showing anomalous activity at both high
and low tides for the 0-3" layer. Note statistically
significant difference in height of high tide and low
tide peaks.
Figure 5 - Percentage per layer found when dawn and high tide
coincide (May 16). Unexpected increase in percentage
found in top layer when high tide is occurring.
