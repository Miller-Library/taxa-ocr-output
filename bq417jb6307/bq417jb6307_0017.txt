Acknowledgement
I'd like to direct my thanks in three directions. First, to the
faculty at Hopkins Marine Station for being there en mass in a cold,
driving 4 a.m. rain when there were no 'bolids; their dedication and
enthusiasm were an inspiration throughout the quarter. Secondly, I'd
like to give Robin Burnett heartfelt thanks for all his help with:
stats and direction; I'll never wonder about carrots and sticks again.
And to Michelle, who livened up those long early morning hours in the
lab, a big grin.
