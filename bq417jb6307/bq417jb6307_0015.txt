these temporally contiguous experiments might suggest that simultaneous
occurrence of high tide and dawn temporarily destabilizes expected
rhythms of endogenous activity. Interestingly, MeSpadden (1978)
observed that when high tide and dawn corresponded during a series of
free-run experiments on the periodicity of jumping activity in A. besselsi,
a radical phase shift was associated with the day on which "crossover"
of the diel and tidal cycles occurred.
