Summary
In a meiofaunal population of the intertidal collembolid
Archisotoma besselsi found on a pocket beach at Mussel Point.
California:
(a) An endogenous rhyth of vertical migration was de-
monstrated and a predictive model of location in the sand-
versus tidal condition was developed.
(b) Tidal patterns with diel influences were implicated
as major components of this endogenous rhyth.
(c) Gross patchiness was exhibited by the population and
was attributed in part to characteristics of the sand
column.
(d) The majority of the population was localized at
approximately + feet above MLLW and was found to remain
at varying depths within the sand even when completely
inundated by the tides.
(e) Exposure to approximately forty-nine hours of a
3-hour delayed tidal regime was insufficient to change
expected trends in the migration pattern.
(f) Suggestion was made that simultaneous occurrence of
dawn and high tide temporarily destabilizes expected activity
rhythms.
