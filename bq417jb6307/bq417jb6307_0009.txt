Results & Discussion
All results indicate components of heterogeneity quite separate
from, and in addition to, temporal variations. Coring showed both
heavy concentrations of animals along a contour 18 meters from the perma¬
nent vegetation and high variability between replicate cores. In combi¬
nation with this, core populations showed variable distribution within
the sand column in apparent response to a complex endogenous rhyth.
While patchiness in collembolid populations has been mentioned (Butcher.
Snider, and Snider, 1971; Chang, 1966; Cox, 1976; Joose, 1966), the
extent and intricacy of this puzzling phenomenon has not been documented.
Observations of high concentrations of animals at station 18 were
frequently coupled with discovery of a dense one- to two-inch layer of
decaying vegetation in the 9"-12" stratum. Since decaying organic matter
is known to be a primary food source for many species of collembolids
(Bacon, 1941; Britt, 1951; Fenton, 1947), attraction to food seems
likely as a cause for patchiness of thesé organisms at Mussel Point.
Cccasionally in samples taken from station 18, up to forty or fifty per-
cent of the animals found in the deepest layer are less than two-thirds
the size of the remainder present. Of these smaller animals, some ex-
hibit the bluish black coloration of adults (Maynard, 1957) while the
smallest organisms display white coloration characteristic of juveniles
(Essig, 1958). Frequently, large concentrations of juveniles occur in
samples from the lowest layer which simultaneously show high amounts of
organic matter; this suggests that reproduction may occur in decaying
wrack buried here. Observations of another intertidal collembolid
Anurida maritima show that it carries out most of its reproductive cycle
in pockets of buried decaying vegetation (Joose, 1966). An explanation
