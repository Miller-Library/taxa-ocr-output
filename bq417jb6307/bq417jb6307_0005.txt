Jars were rapidly sealed to prevent loss of collembolids. The end of
the plunger was rinsed between each usage to prevent contamination from
one core to the next.
Animals were extracted from each jar by the following technique:
To each jar, I added approximately 30 mls of seawater and roughly 5-10 mls
of ethanol (95%) to kill the collembolids present. Each jar was swirled
gently to dislodge specimens and then decanted into a 150 ml beaker.
Washing with seawater alone was repeated twice more and the liquid de-
canted into the same beaker. Under a dissecting microscope, the inactive
and floating collembola were easily counted. I recorded the number of
animals extracted from each layer, then computed the percentage of the
core population in each 3" layer.
Field studies and collections for laboratory experiments were con¬
ducted on a pocket beach at Mussel Point in Monterey Bay. This beach
faces west and is composed of well-sorted granitic sand, fine to medium
in grain size. Use of graded Tyler sieves showed representative sand
samples to be characterized by the following regime of size classes:
#10-10%, #12-11%, #20-14, +35-26%, and 60 or smaller-9. In sev-
eral experiments requiring sand devoid of organic matter, commercial sand
of grades 20 and 35 was mixed in a ratio of 2:1 to approximate natural
conditions.
A preliminary survey of the distribution of organisms from lower
low water up to the permanent vegetation (at +11 feet above MLLW) revealed
two things. First, the meiofaunal population was highly localized
along a contour corresponding to +4 féet' tidal height. This area,:
later referred to as"station 18', consisted of points located 18 meters
seaward of the vegatation/beach interface. Underwater coring seåward
