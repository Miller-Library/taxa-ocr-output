in each case. For May 4th and 5th, elevation of values for percentage
in the bottom layer together with reduced values in the top layer is
probably weather-related; high surf conditions prevailed when samples
were collected for the May 4 study whereas conditions were much calmer
prior to the May 20 experiment.
Complete results of the May 4 & 5 study are shown in Figure 2.
The trends seen suggested a predictive model of temporal movement in the
meiofaunal collembolid population: an increase in the percentage of
animals in the top layer is seen at low tides while a decrease is ob-
served for high tide; a similar but inverse relationship to tides is
seen for the lowest layer. In this graph, the middle layers show an
inverse relationship to each other, and the movements in these layers
do not correspond well to known exogenous cycles. In all studies, miÂ¬
gration activity shown by these middle layers displayed much higher var-
iability than that shown by either the top (0-3") or the bottom (9-12")
layers. Therefore, in subsequent figures only data from the top and
bottom strata are illustrated and discussed.
Despite the fact that data from most 24-hour experiments appeared
by inspection to fit the proposed hypothesis of migration patterns :
correlated to tidal phenomena, statistical tests sometimes cast doubts.
For example, performing a linear regression followed by pair-wise
t-tests on data collected May 4 & 5 shows differences between mean high
tide and low tide values within each layer to be statistically insigni-
ficant. Similarly, when data from this study is combined with that from
four others conducted between May 9 and May 25, log-transformed means
compared by t-test again fail to show significance between all the high
and low tide values obtained; this is probably due to higher variability
shown in patterns of migration during daylight hours.
