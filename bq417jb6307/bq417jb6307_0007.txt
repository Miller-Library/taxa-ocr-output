rates of flow were recorded for each column and the means of the results
compared by t-tests.
Effects of an altered diel cycle on endogenous vertical migration
were tested in one experiment conducted May 24-26. Cores receiving a
3-hour delayed day/night cycle were capped with inverted translucent
disposable 150-ml tri-lipped beakers. Two cans containing five cores
each were placed in a cardboard box and subjected to illumination of
300E during 14 hours of imposed daylight; the cores were left undis-
turbed for 49 hours prior to the first of two sampling periods.
In a similar experiment employing a 3-hour delayed tidal cycle,
"high" tide consisted of letting 11 C seawater stand within the PVC pipe
to a depth of one inch above the sand for approximately 64 hours.
"Low
tide conditions were imposed by draining the water out the bottoms of
the tubes through phytoplankton screening placed over a hole in the bot-
tom stopper. Water was reinstated 64 hours later (at the next "high"
tide) by affixing a pinch clamp to flexible tubing emerging from the
stopper hole.
Due to problems inherent in patchiness of the population under
study, statistical analyses were extremely important. In conjunction with
t-tests, linear regressions were used to adjust for a trend toward
smaller core populations with increasing time between time of collection
and processing; while this phenomenon suggested escape of collembolids
from cores kept in the laboratory, spot checks found no evidence of this.
With single classification analyses of variance (used with f-tests), I
used log transformations of percentages in order to normalize the data.
Cox (1976) has shoun this mothod to be acceptable in studies of another
intertidal collembolid Anurida maritima. Significance of changes seen
