undisturbed field population. Cbservations of ten cores subjected to
altered light/dark conditions for 493 hours prior to sampling proved in-
conclusive; unlike normal samples, these cores showed no apparent change
in the percentage of animals found per layer from the first to the
second (and last) readings. Core dessication may have caused death.
Figure 4 presents results of a 24-hour study conducted May 16 & 17
which yielded statistically significant but anomalous behavior in the
surface layer. Single-classification analyses of variance (Sokal and
Rohlf, 1969) reveal that there is a significant change in the means ob-
served for the top layer through time (pX.05). Inspection of the
graph affirms this; not only are peaks in activity of the top layer
seen at low tides, but similarly dramatic peaks appear at high tides.
Note that peaks seen at low tides are significantly higher than peaks
at high tide; pair-wise t-tests for percentage showed the difference be-
tween the means of the high tide and low tide peaks to be expected as
random with p .01. This study shows rhythmic migration behavior
which is exceptionally well correlated with tidal phenomena; however,
peaks in surface layer activity at high tide contradict trends expected
by the predictive model. The r√©asons for this anomalous bimodal pattern
are unknown. Such a phenomenon was not seen in any other experiment;
a study conducted three days later (on May 20) showed a return to
previously seen activity patterns (See Figure 14).
Figure 5 shows the results of an experiment conducted May 16, when
high tide corresponded almost exactly with dawn. Note that this study
was actually conducted the day before that shown in Fizure 4; as in
the latter, surface activity increases rather than decreases for condi-
tions of high tide. Anomalous trends in activity of the top layer in
