Introduction
Collembolids comprise an insect order whose members range widely
throughout the world, being found in almost every habitat where there
is moisture together with decaying vegetation (Bacon, 1941; Chang, 1966).
Because of their wide distribution, collembolids have been discussed
frequently in the literature. Due to economic factors, large populations
inhabiting agricultural soils have received the most attention; far less
has been written regarding species found in other habitats. Inter-
tidal species, for example, are only occasionally described in the lite¬
rature despite the fact that they also exhibit extremely high population
densities, with estimates of as many as 20,000/ m
(Davenport, 1903).
The meiofaunal component of intertidal collembolid populations has
rarely even been mentioned (Cox, 1976; Davenport, 1903), and there is
no work on temporal variation in their distribution in the sand. A dis-
crepancy in observed activity patterns of surface and meiofaunal elements
of a population of Archisotoma besselsi found on a pocket beach at
Mussel Point, California, prompted the experiments presented herein.
Twenty-four hour field studies conducted on this beach showed high
amounts of surface jumping activity concentrated at dawn regardless of
tidal conditions; in contrast, core samples taken periodically on the
same beach showed evidence of vertical migration related to tidal pheno-
mena. Observations through aquarium glass showed rates of migratory move-
ment approaching 3 cm/min. Field and laboratory studies revealed a
complex pattern of endogenous vertical migration activity having both
tidal and diel components. These results are of particular interest
when considered in conjunction with work done concurrently on the rhyth¬
mic jumping activity of the adjacent surface population by fellow workers
at Hopkins Marine Station (DeLapa, 1978; MoSpadden, 1978).
