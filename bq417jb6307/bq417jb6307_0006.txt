of the swash zone showed sustained high concentrations of animals in
the sand at station 18, despite a rising tide. This phenomenon is not
mentioned in the literature on intertidal collembolid species. Collec-
tion of cores for subsequent laboratory studies of endogenous behavior
were always made at this station.
The second major finding résulting from preliminary field studies
was that of marked differences in micro-scale distribution. Replicate
cores taken simultaneously at any one level of the beach invariably
showed a significant degree of heterogeneity (Rx C tests, Sokal and
Rohlf (1969); G values of 39.6 and 173.22 in two determinations, n-5
each time). Laboratory experiments showed this patchiness phenomenon
to persist even when animals were presented with a homogeneous environ-
ment of clean commercial sand kept under constant conditions. A five¬
gallon translucent white plastic container was painted black, then filled
with moist sand (8% by weight). A similar but unpainted container was
inverted and sealed to the first. Members of the experimental popula-
tion jumped off of a piece of filter paper which was introduced and later
removed; this method avoided bias due to localized addition of dead or-
ganisms. Diffuse dim lighting and constant temperatures were maintained
for twenty-four hours prior to sampling.
Studies of porosity explored this environmental factor as a possible
cause for patchy distribution of the field population; in order to ana-
lyze rates of water-flow through a column, sand from four sibling
samples was recombined, dried, and mixed thoroughly to simulate as
closely as possible porosity properties of the original core. Sand was
poured to a depth of 40 cm in lengths of 1.7 cm-diameter glass tubing to
which screen ad been affixed at the bottom. Columns prepared in this
manner were then suspended from a ring stand and wetted. Replicate
