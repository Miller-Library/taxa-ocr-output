for the apparent increase in numbers of smaller animals with depth may
be due to microhabitat structure changes inherent in greater depth;
specifically, diminishing pore space may limit the depths reached by
collembola of different sizes just as it does for the meiofuana in
general (Christiansen, 1964).
Laboratory experiments testing possible effects of substrait strucÂ¬
ture on patchiness were revealing but did not show positive correlation
between the two. Studies of porosity versus number of animals extracted
showed no significant difference between cores which had shown very high
populations and those which had not. In experiments ranging in length
from one-half to three hours, animals inhabiting 3" layers of sand col-
lected in the field showed no migration into clean commercial sand placed
adjacent in the cylinders to the natural sand. Simultaneous field and
laboratory experiments (n-7 for each) showed that, like those in the
field, animals exposed for twenty-four hours to a homogeneous environ-
ment of commercial sand also exhibited significant patchiness (indices
of dispersion: X =73.8 and X =22.8 for lab and field studies, respec-
tively; p2.001 in both cases). The implication is strong that biolo-
gical interactions are in part responsible for the patchiness displayed
by both'the laboratory and field populations in this experiment.
Studies of microhabitat moisture differences supported previous
work showing differential distribution of collembolids in response to
this environmental parameter (Bacon, 1921; Butcher, Snider, and Snider,
1971; Christiansen, 1964; Ford, 1937; Joose, 1966). In a comparative
experiment, station 15 displayed uniforaly and significantly higher per-
centages of animals in the lowest layer than was found from station 18
(px.O1, t-test for percentage); animals higher on the beach might be
