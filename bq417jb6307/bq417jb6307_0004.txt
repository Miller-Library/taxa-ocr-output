Materials and Methods
I used the coring apparatus described by Cox (1976); fourteen-inch
lengths of 3.5-cm diameter schedule-40 PVC pipe were bevelled on one
end and marked around their circumference 12" from the lower edge.
Treatment with silicon spray lubricant facilitated pushing out samples
for analysis; collembolids were never observed sticking to lubricated
cylinder walls. In the field, cores were pounded twelve inches into
the sand, plugged with a 7 solid rubber stopper, withdrawn, and sealed
on the bottom with another stopper to prevent loss of animals and water,
and to prevent reception of light cues by the organisms. A twelve-inch
depth was chosen and used uniformly throughout the experiments; my obÂ¬
servations showed the highest concentrations of specimens within this
column despite occurrence of collembolids to atleast 18" below the
surface.
All cores for a particular experiment were moved simultaneously into
a constant 18 C room. Here, the sealed cores were separated randomly
into batches of n cores and each batch placed upright in a separate
container. Originally, n was three but was changed later to 5 in an
attempt to minimize variability due to patchiness. At each sampling
period (corresponding closely with the external high tide, lowitide, and
an intermediate point for most studies), a container of n cores was re-
moved from the constant temperature room for immediate processing.
To process each core, the bottom stopper was removed and the base
of the core set into a sample jar. I would then remove the top stopper
and inspect the sand surface within the cylinder to observe any animals
active there. I would push out three-inch lengths of the sand column
into each of four sample jars, the lowest layer being pushed out first.
