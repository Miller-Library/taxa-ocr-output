ABSTRACT
Organisms occupying rocky intertidal habitats are exposed to extreme temperature
fluctuations. Given the pervasive effects of temperature on physiological function, large changes
in gene expression would be expected in these organisms as temperature varies. Gene
expression at elevated temperatures was investigated in vitro using gill tissue from the mussel
Mytilus californianus. Tissues were exposed to temperatures between 20.1 and 36.2째 C. and
differential expression was evaluated using a 4224 cDNA Mytilus microarray. At 33째 C. mRNA
levels for hsp70 were induced 60 to 110-fold compared to the control temperature. Several other
genes coding for proteins involved in protein folding (hsp20), degradation of denatured
polypeptides (sequestosome 1), apoptosis (fos-related antigen 2), and other activities appeared to
be induced with elevated temperature. mRNA levels for most genes were greatly reduced at
36.2째 C, suggesting a deleterious effect of temperature on gene expression (either retardation of
induction or greater degradation of mRNA) at this temperature. Simulated mussel body
temperatures in excess of 41째 C were recorded at the collection site. Thus, habitat temperatures
may occasionally exceed the thermal tolerance limits of the animal. This is likely to affect the
ecology and biogeography of the species.
