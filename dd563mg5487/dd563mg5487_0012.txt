(4/25/04). Body temperatures exceed habitat temperatures at the hottest point. This figure also

Limitations of the study
The large number of missing data points as well as the limited number of replicates in the
study preclude rigorous statistical analysis of gene expression. Increased replication is a priority
for future experiments. An increased number of temperature points would also allow for a more
accurate understanding of where induction of various genes begins, peaks, and ends.
This study characterizes transcript responses to heat stress in a laboratory setting. Gene
induction under natural conditions is also influenced by other factors such as hypoxia and
desiccation stress. Expression patterns in the field may differ from those in the lab.
Nevertheless, this study can be viewed as a necessary baseline for a field study of gene
expression in Mytilus californianus.
CONCLUSION
Despite the limitations just discussed, this study identifies several important aspects of
gene expression in M. californianus in response to elevated temperature. The clear expression
profiles of hsp70 and hsp20 indicate that the microarray can accurately detect induction of genes
as temperature increases. The consistent inter-individual variation observed in the expression
profiles of hsp70 and hsp20 suggests that there may be some difference (possibly due to genetic
differences or thermal history) between individuals that affects their response to temperature.
Several other genes showed induction with heat. Most of these genes code for proteins
with functions that would be likely to be induced with increased thermal stress. A number of
unidentifiable genes also showed strong induction. These results all deserve further exploration.
