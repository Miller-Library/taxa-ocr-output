been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle and in programmed cell death in mice (Smeyne et
al., 1993). FÖSL2 showed a general pattern of induction at higher temperatures (fig. 3), although
the trend was not as clear as with the molecular chaperones (fig. 1 and 2). It is possible that the
induction of FOSL2 at elevated temperatures is an indication of an apoptotic response to heat
stress. Previous studies have shown that FÖSL2 is induced in response to injury and
environmental stress in mice and rats (Butler and Pennypacker, 2004; Pompeiano et al., 2002).
For the two animals with data for both control points, the induction of FÖSL2 was slightly lower
in the frozen control sample than in the control that was kept at 14° C during the experiment,
This suggests that there may be some effect of dissection or handling on the expression of
FÖSL2.
Due to the higher quality of the array data from Animal A compared to B and C, trends
may be clearer in the results from this animal than from the other two. Table 1 lists several
genes in Animal A that showed expression patterns similar to hsp70 and hsp20. Since many of
these genes only showed differential expression in one animal, it would be premature to
conclude that they are part of a temperature response. However, these genes would be worth
examining in future experiments. DNA double strand repair enzyme might be induced in
response to potential thermal damage to DNA. MAP kinase, adenosine A2b receptor, and wnt¬
7b are all involved in cellular signaling. Histone deacetylase II is a transcriptional repressor
Across all three animals, genes were chosen for sequencing that showed induction at
elevated temperature. Because the genomes of non-model organisms such as M. californianus
have not been as extensively described as those of model organisms such as D. melanogaster, M.
musculus, or C. elegans, many of the genes that we sequenced could not be identified in the
