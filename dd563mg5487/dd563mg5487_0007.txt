Data Normalization and Analysis
Data analysis was completed using GeneSpring software (GeneSpring, Liverpool). Per¬
spot normalizations were used to normalize the treatment samples to the reference by dividing
the intensity of the Cy-5 signal at each spot by the intensity of the Cy-3 signal at that spot. Per-
chip intensity-dependent Lowess normalization was also applied. This procedure divides the
intensity of the signal for each gene by the median intensity for the chip, in order to reduce the
effects of experimental variation across the chip.
Following these normalizations, the "Normalize to Specific Samples" function in
GeneSpring was used to normalize the elevated temperature samples (20.1 -36.2° C) for each
animal to the median of the two control chips for that animal. This normalization divided the
intensity of a given spot on the treatment array by the intensity of the same spot on the control
arrays.
Environmental Temperature Monitoring
The temperature records used in this study were measured with iButton temperature
recorders (Dallas Semiconductor, Dallas). A single iButton was epoxied on the rock next to the
mussel bed where experimental animals were collected. iButtons were placed inside of two
müssel shells filled with silicone sealant, which has been shown to approximate the heat capacity
of mussel tissue (Helmuth and Hofmann, 2001). These shells were epoxied next to the mussel
bed to track simulated body temperatures. The iButtons were in the field between 4/23/04 and
5/13/04.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As this was the first experiment to use the Mytilus microarray, and because the RNA
yield from each tissue sample was limited by the small mass of tissue used (1/8" of a gill), some
