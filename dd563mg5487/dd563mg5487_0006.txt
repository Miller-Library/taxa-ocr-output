total RNA were mixed with 5 ug of oligo-dT primer in a volume of 14 ul water, denatured at 70°
C for 5 mins, and annealed on ice for 10 mins. Then 2 ul of O.1M dithiothreitol, 1 ul of
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP's) [10 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 5 mM dTTP. 5 mM
amino-allyl dUTP), 2ul of lOx reverse transcriptase reaction buffer, and 1 ul of Stratascript
reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, Austin) were added. The reaction was terminated by addition
of 5 ul 0.8 MNaOH and heating to 65° C for 15 mins. 5 ul of 0.8 MHCl were added to
neutralize the reaction.
Resulting cDNA was purified using MinElute purification columns [Qiagen, Valencia,
CAJ. Purified CDNA was brought to 10 ul in 0.1 M NaHCOz. The cDNA was coupled to Cy¬
dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) using standard protocols [www.microarrays.orgl.
Treatment samples were coupled to Cy-5 and reference to Cy-3. Treatment and reference
samples were competitively hybridized onto a 4,224 cDNA Mytilus microarray in 20 ul of 3x
sodium chloride/sodium citrate solution (SSC), 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 0.2% SDS, 10 ug of
synthetic poly-A RNA at 65° C for 18 hours. Slides were washed and scanned according to
standard procedures www.microarrays.org). Spot intensities were assayed using an Axon
scanner (Axon, Foster City, CA) and GenePix software (Axon, Foster City, CA).
Sequencing
Ninety-six genes that showed induction with temperature were selected for sequencing.
Products were sequenced from the 5’ direction using Big Dye terminator mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A putative homology was assigned to genes based on BlastX
searches against the NCBI database [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1.
