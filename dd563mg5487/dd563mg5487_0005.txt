MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Care of Specimens
Mussels were collected from a moderately wave-protected area of the Hopkins Marine
Life Refüge (Monterey, CA) on March 14, 2004. They were held in 14° C filtered seawater
tanks for two weeks prior to the heat shock experiment.
Heat Shock Experiment
Gills from single animals were grouped together for the heating experiments to eliminate
the effects of interindividual variation on the data. Three animals were used in the study. Each
mussel's gills were sectioned into 8 pieces. Dissections were performed on plastic trays floating
in 14° C water to minimize heat exposure during this step. One gill sample from each animal
was frozen on dry ice immediately after dissection. A second control sample was held at 14° C
throughout the course of the experiment. The remaining 6 samples from each individual were
exposed to temperatures of 20.1° C, 23.0° C, 25.9° C, 28.9° C, 33.0° C, or 36.2° C for 30
minutes. Following the heat shock, samples were allowed to recover at 14° C for 1 hour. To
prevent a confounding effect of hypoxia, samples were aerated during the heat shock and
recovery by blowing a concentrated stream of air into the tube via a Pasteur pipette. At the end
of the recovery period, samples were frozen on dry ice for later processing
RNA isolation and microarray hybridization
RNA was extracted from the gill samples using Trizol according to manufacturer's
instructions (Invitrogen, San Diego). A reference RNA was prepared by extracting RNA from
the pooled gill and adductor muscle tissues of 5 individual animals that had been acclimated to
14° C for 3 weeks. Treatment and reference RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA and
labeled with fluorescent dyes using standard protocols [www.microarrays.orgl. Briefly, 10 ug of
