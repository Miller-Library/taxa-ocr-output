acclimated M. californianus, Buckley et al. (2001) found a threshold induction temperature of
26Â° C for heat shock proteins.
Targeted protein studies are only able to address a small number of changes at a time. In
contrast, the application of cDNA microarray technology allows for a global view of gene
expression. This technique makes it possible to understand broad changes and subtle shifts in
mRNA levels across the genome. For example, using this technique, Podrabsky and Somero
(2004) found that several genes involved in cell growth and proliferation were differentially
expressed in fish of the species Austrofundulus limnaeus that were exposed to different
temperature regimes. Because they allow for genome-wide analysis, DNA microarray
approaches have great promise for identifying genes induced in response to environmental
change (Gracey and Cossins, 2003; Podrabsky and Somero, 2004).
While mRNA levels do not perfectly predict the concentration or activity of proteins in
the cell (due to RNA degradation or post-translational modification of enzymes), there is good
quantitative evidence that transcript amounts accurately reflect protein levels in many cases
(Gracey and Cossins, 2003). The connection between transcription and higher order
physiological processes is especially solid during periods of stress or environmental change
(Gracey and Cossins, 2003, Gasch et al., 2000). Applications of microarray technology to non-
model organisms are currently largely exploratory. Descriptive studies are required to move the
field forward, especially in light of the large number of sequenced genes whose functions have
not been characterized (Gracey and Cossins, 2003). While the approach is still in its infancy,
microarray studies offer an avenue for linking gene regulation with the ecology and
biogeography of M. californianus and other species.
