Figure Legends
Fig. 1: Hsp70 mRNA levels in the three animals at each temperature point.
Fig. 2: Hsp20 mRNA levels in the three animals. Consistent within-animal patterns are apparent
between hsp70 (figure 1) and hsp20.
Fig. 3: False induction signal for Hsc70. 04B06 and 05D17 refer to the two different Hsc70
spots on the array.
Fig. 4: Sequestosome 1 expression profile. This gene is involved in aggregating ubiquitinated
polypeptides.
Fig. 5: FÃ–SL2 expression profiles for the three animals.
Fig. 6: Simulated body temperatures recorded by iButtons placed inside silicone-filled mussel
shells between 4/23/04 and 5/13/04 at Hopkins Marine Station.
Fig. 7: Environmental temperatures recorded by an exposed iButton attached to the rock next to
the mussel bed where simulated body temperatures were recorded.
Fig. 8: Habitat temperatures and simulated body temperatures from April 25, 2004. High and
low tides are given in distance (feet) from MLW and are represented by red dots.
