have been found to have smaller maximum size and slower growth rates than lower-occurring
individuals (Harger, 1970).
In light of temperature’s pervasive effects, one would expect large changes in gene
expression as temperature changes. Until recently, investigations of these shifts have been
limited to targeted studies of individual proteins. This type of work has yielded a large amount
of information on a small number of proteins that, taken together, constitute what is known as the
heat shock response. With the exception of some Antarctic fishes (Hofmann et al., 2000), this
suite of proteins has been found to be conserved in every examined species. Heat shock protein
70 (hsp70) and heat shock protein 20 (hsp20) are high- and low-molecular weight inducible
isoforms of chaperone proteins that bind to polypeptides denatured by heating, cooling, or other
stresses and aid in refolding. Heat shock proteins also prevent the formation of dangerous
aggregations of unfolded proteins in the cell (Ellis and van der Vies, 1991). Another central
element of the heat shock response is the protein ubiquitin, which tags irreversibly denatured
proteins for degradation in the proteasome (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992). The temperatures
at which the genes involved in the heat shock response are induced have been shown to be
subject to acclimation and acclimatization (Roberts et al., 1997). There is also a maximum
temperature of heat shock protein synthesis, above which the proteins are no longer induced
(Tomanek and Somero, 1999). Many studies have described the threshold, peak, and maximal
induction temperatures, as well as the potential for acclimation/acclimatization of the heat shock
response, in various intertidal organisms, including species of the genus Mytilus (Roberts et al.,
1997; Hofmann and Somero, 1996a; Hofmann and Somero, 1996b; Buckley et al., 2001) and
Tegula (Tomanek and Somero, 1999; Tomanek and Somero; 2000). In 13° C laboratory
