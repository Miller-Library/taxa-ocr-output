foot, the size of the limpet influenced the time it took to begin the
extrusion of the mantle following stimulation. Figure 5 indicates that as
the length of the limpet increases, latency of the response also increases.
Mantle extrusion is not an instaneous process and shows a good degree

of variability in its time course. The total time required to complete the

mantle response was therefore measured (Figure 6). This time ranged from 1
to 15 seconds. The graph is, however, not adjusted for size of the limpet.

Direction and Degree of Rotation Dependence on Stimulus Site
Figure 7 illustrates results from a series of experiments indicating
that the point of stimulation determines the direction and the magnitude of
the angle that the limpet will rotate through. The central oval in the
figure represents a keyhole limpet (dorsal view) where the anterior end
corresponds to zero degrees. Each numbered line refers to the point of
stimulation measured as an angle with respect to the zero mark. The open
circles contain information referring to angles turned at each point of
stimulation. Arrows on the circles indicate the direction and magnitude of
the angle turned by an individual limpet relative to the zero point. The
dotted lines correspond to the means of the angles turned for clockwise and
counterclockwise rotation. A closed circle refers to an individual limpet
which did not detectably rotate. Detection sensitivity was 15'.
From this figure it is apparent that the limpet turns in such a way so
as to move its head away from the stimulation point especially at the 0, 45,
and 90° points. Stimulation at 0° evokes a strong counterclockwise
preference for rotation. Rotating seems less consistent and less marked
with 135 and 180° stimulation. As shown more quantitatively below, the
magnitude of the angle of rotation increases steadily as the limpet is
stimulated closer to its head.
