foot stimulation, but only 22 of horizontal vs. 452 of vertical limpets
stopped the response at the stage 2 level. Again, this difference is still
obvious when the vertical values are scaled (x47/35) to correspond to the
horizontal sample size (dotted line).
DISCUSSION
From this research it is evident that Fissurella volcano has a distinct
response to the starfish Pisaster ochraceus which undoubtedly serves as an
escape mechanism. Once provoked by the starfish, the limpet has a
stereotyped behavior which can be broken down into component parts: lifting,
extruding, rotating, and fleeing. Diodora aspera, a related keyhole limpet,
has a similar response to starfish, however, it only consists of two parts
(Margolin, 1964). These components include the mantle response and the
lifting of the entire shell as opposed to tilting specifically at the point
of stimulation as in Fissurella.
In investigating individual parts of the behavior, latency for the
mantle response was found to decrease as limpet size decreased. Why this is
true is not clear. The times involved are far longer than could be
accounted for by neuronal conduction, etc. Possibly the phenomenon is an
adaptive one. Because the tenacity of a limpet adhering to substrate must
depend on the surface area of the foot, smaller limpets may be much more
easily dislodged by a starfish than larger ones. Thus, it may be very
advantageous for small animals to react as quickly as possible to prevent
tube feet from attaching to their shells.
Another method that these limpets have evolved to avoid contact by
starfish is rotating the head away from the point of stimulation. Ability
to escape the starfish is thus enhanced by this directed turning by allowing
the limpet to flee by locomoting forward. Attack by a starfish closer to
