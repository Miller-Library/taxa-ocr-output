Responses of Horizontal vs. Vertical Limpets
Differences in the intensity of each of the behavioral components of
limpets tested on horizontal vs. vertical surfaces were found. Analysis of
rotation by horizontally oriented limpets is continued in Figure 8 where the
mean absolute value (+ standard error of the mean) of the degree of rotation
for horizontal limpets is plotted vs. absolute value of stimulation site
(ie. direction of rotation is ignored). Magnitude of rotation decreases
smoothly as the point of stimulation approaches the posterior end of the
limpet.
The magnitude of rotation for vertically oriented limpets is smaller
than that of the horizontal limpets for all points of stimulation except at
135° where they are not detectably different. Limpets tested on a vertical
surface also exhibit a lesser degree of rotation as the stimulus site moves
posteriorly but may show a more abrupt decrease in angle size as stimulation
moves from 0° to 45° than do horizontal limpets. The smaller sample size of
vertical limpets makes such detailed comparisons difficult though.
Fleeing was also studied in horizontal vs. vertical limpets. As shown
in Figure 9A, whether or not a limpet on a horizontal surface will flee once
stimulated seems random. In comparison, vertical limpets flee far less
frequently. Scaling (x 41/27) of the vertical numbers plotted so they
represent the same sample size as the horizontal values does not alter this
conclusion. This difference in fleeing frequency between horizontal vs.
vertical limpets is highly significant by the Chi square test.
Magnitudes of the mantle extrusion response for limpets on horizontal
vs. vertical surfaces also differ dramatically. Figure 9B shows results on
an analysis in which mantle extrusion was estimated with the O - 3 scale
(See Methods) for each population. All limpets showed some response to tube
