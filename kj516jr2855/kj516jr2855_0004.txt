implied that the mantle extended over the shell but the full response was
not yet reached, and 3 indicated that the full response took place.
Finally, R was preceded by the magnitude of the angle turned which was found
by measuring along the longitudinal axis. Above this number an arrow was
written indicating the direction turned. Using this code the behavior could
be characterized more consistently and accurately. Timing of the behavior
was done using a stopwatch and taking an average time from the videotapes.


Reaction time of the timer was subtracted for calculations.
Detection of the starfish at a distance was tested by first placing a
starfish into an elevated bath of running sea water. Rubber tubing was
connected to the container and carried the "starfish water" over a ramp and
to the limpets. Limpets were placed in a trough with no ends so that water
would flow over the limpets unidirectionally at 0.165m/s. The limpets were
measured and placed 120mm from the downstream end of the container in
alternating directions and subsequently observed for 30 minutes.
RESULTS
Anatomy of the Mantle Tentacle System
Figure 1 illustrates the gross morphology of the mantle tentacles of
Fissurella volcano. There are two parallel bands of tentacles. All of the
tentacles are highly vascularized by blood sinuses and can be inflated by
the pumping of blood into them from the very large heart. A similar single
band of tentacles encircles the keyhole region. The picture depicted in
Figure 1 is that of the animal after it has displayed the mantle response to
starfish tube feet stimulation. The most peripheral band of tentacles
extends upwards and over the top of the shell. The second group of
tentacles protrudes from beneath the shell and lies parallel to the
substrate to which the limpet is attached. The tentacles are irregularly
