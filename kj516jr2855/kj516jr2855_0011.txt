be constantly in a state of alarm and ready to react to a few water-borne

molecules. Similarly, the animal does not have to expend an unnecessary


amount of energy in maintaining the extruded mantle in a permanent defensive

position. The interplay between water-borne and contact-mediated behaviors
suggested here deserves additional study.

Unlike several other species of limpets, Fissurella volcano does not

flee when exposed to starfish water. Phillips found that Collisella

limatula and Notoacmea scutum move downstream when exposed to flowing water

which previously passed over a living starfish. In contrast, Fissurella

shows no obvious directed movement under identical conditions. Fissurella
only flees as a culmination of the entire escape response elicited by

contact between mantle tentacles and tube feet.


The mantle extrusion response probably more than compensates for this
deficiency in their behavior by repelling starfish tube feet. The fraction
of the shell that is exposed may not allow the starfish to get a good grip
on Fissurella. This combined with movement away from the starfish via
rotation and fleeing enhance its ability to escape predation. Despite much
superficial similarity in the responses to starfish of Fissurella,
Notoacmea, and Collisella limpets, definite differences exist in behavioral
details, receptor location and type, and in neural pathways involved. Such
specific differences would be expected based on the disparate taxonomic
positions of Fissurella and the other genera. Further investigation of
these differences may better explain the adaptive significance of the
limpets' respective responses in light of the particular environment in
which each lives.
