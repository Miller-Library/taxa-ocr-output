ABSTRACT

The keyhole limpet Fissurella volcano has a sequential escape response
to stimulation by tube feet of the predatory starfish Pisaster ochraceus.
The response consists of 1) elevation of the shell at the point of
stimulation, 2) extrusion of the mantle over the shell, 3) rotation of the

shell around the keyhole axis, and 4) rapid locomotion away (fleeing).
Limpets on horizontal surfaces have a stronger response to tube feet than do
those on vertical surfaces. Responses to sea water which presumably
contains a water soluble starfish scent consist of only the mantle extrusion
response. Finally, receptors mediating detection of the starfish substance
appear to be located on the tips of the mantle tentacles.
