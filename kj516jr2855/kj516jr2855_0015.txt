ACKNOWLEDGMENT
Many thanks to Dr. William Gilly for his tremendous help in completing
this project and for the great fishing trips which definitely were
highlights of the quarter. Thanks also to Chuck Baxter for invaluable advice
and to the rest of the Hopkins people for making this a great learning
experience.
