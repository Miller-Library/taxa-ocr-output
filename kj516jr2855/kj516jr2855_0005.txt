and multiply branched.
More detailed morphology of the tentacle tips as revealed by scanning
electron microscopy is shown in Figure 2. Clusters of ciliary structures,
several microns in diameter, are located on the tentacles and seem to be
most common on the tips of the tentacles (Figure 24). Examination of a
cluster of ciliary structures at higher magnification (Figure 2B) shows that
each cilium is capped by a round bulb. These structures thus appear to be
"paddle cilia," which are thought to be chemosensitive in many molluscan
tissues (Haszprunar, 1985). Each cluster is seated in a small pit in the
microvillar coating of the tentacle epithelium.
Upon stimulation of various parts of the mantle and foot with a tube
foot, the response was elicited most strongly when touched on the tips of
the tentacles. From this information in conjunction with the scanning
electron micrographs, it appears that the ciliary structures are probably
the chemoreceptors involved in starfish detection. These receptors in
Fissurella are arranged very differently from those of Notoacmea scutum, a
limpet which runs from Pisaster. Unlike Fissurella, the receptors are much
more highly concentrated on the tips of Notoacmea tentacles and are not
embedded in pits in the epithelium covering the mantle (Phillips, 1977).
Response of Fissurella to Predatory Starfish
The entire escape sequence was only elicited upon stimulation of the
tentacles with starfish tube feet. Mechanical stimulation of the tentacles
resulted in withdrawal of the mantle.
The general sequence of the response was derived from the coded videos
and is schematized in Figure 3. It consisted of:
1) Lifting (Figure 3B)
2) Mantle extrusion (Figure 30)
