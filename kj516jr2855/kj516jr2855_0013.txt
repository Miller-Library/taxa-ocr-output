Figure 8. Point of stimulation vs. degrees turned in horizontal and vertical


limpets. Differences between horizontal and vertical limpets are significant
(f992) at each angle except at 90° where they are marginally significant and
at 135°.

Figure 9. Differences exist in the escape responses of horizontal vs.

vertical limpets. Dotted lines refer to values adjusted for equal sample

sizes. 94) Representation of whether animals flee or not when tested on

horizontal vs. vertical surfaces. 9B) Degree of mantle extrusion response

vs. Number of limpets. The degree of response was measured on a scale of

zero to three where three represents the full mantle response.
