FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Mantle tentacles. Mantle tentacles are depicted as they appear
following extrusion due to stimulation by a starfish tube foot.
Figure 2. Scanning electron microscopy of mantle tentacle. 2A) Possible
receptors on the tip of a tentacle are shown. Receptors are ciliary
structures. 2B) Ten times the above magnification of a receptor group sunk
into a pit in the coating of microvilli covering the tentacle tip.
Figure 3. Starfish escape response sequence. 3B) Limpet lifts its shell at
the point of stimulation, 30) extrudes its mantle, 3D) rotates, and then 3E)
flees.
Figure 4. Total number of limpets with a full mantle response increases with
time of exposure to starfish water or tube feet. The solid line depicts
those exposed to water previously run over a starfish. The dotted line
refers to the time course involved when touched with a tube foot.
Figure 5. Length vs. Time to begin mantle response. As the size of the
limpet increases, the time required to begin the mantle response increases.
Figure 6. Time vs. Number of limpets that have completed the mantle
response. This graph does not account for size of the limpets sampled. All
limpets eventually complete the response.
Figure 7. Direction and magnitude of angle rotated following tube foot
stimulation. See text for explanation.
