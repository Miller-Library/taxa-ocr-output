For scanning electron microscopy the limpet was first stimulated using


a tube foot to increase tentacle tip exposure and then immediately submerged
in low calcium sea water containing 460mM Nacl, lmM Cacl, 50mM MgCl, 1OmM

KCl, 10mM Hepes, and 5mM tetracaine, a solution which prevents contraction



of the mantle. The limpet was subsequently de-shelled and fixed in a

solution containing 12 glutaraldehyde, 12 para-formaldehyde, 0.22 sodium

cacodylate, and 852 sea water at pH 7.3. Pieces of the mantle tissue with


tentacles were then dissected and dehydrated in a graded acetone series.

The remaining liquid was removed by critical point drying.

Behavioral analysis was carried out using a video camera and tape
recorder. A magnifying glass placed on the camera lens increased

magnification of the subject. Limpets were tested on glass surfaces where

they were manually stimulated by a tube foot held by forceps. These
surfaces were either horizontal or vertical. A code that characterized the
four components of the behavior was devised:
L = lifting of the shell, generally at the point of stimulation
M = extruding the mantle over the shell
R = rotation around the keyhole axis
F = fleeing
L,M, and R were each preceded by a descriptive symbol. L was accompanied by
one of the following descriptions to indicate where the shell lifted up:
L = left
R = right
B = back
F = front
M was rated on a scale of O to 3 where O was no mantle response, 1 referred
to the first row of tentacles sticking out slightly from below the shell, 2
