3) Rotation (Figure 3D)
4) Fleeing (not illustrated)
Lifting involved the upward tilting of the shell at the point of
stimulation. This resulted in a broad exposure of the foot to the starfish.
Approximately half the surface area of the shell was subsequently covered by
mantle tissue emanating from both out of the apical orifice (ie. keyhole)

and upwards around the rim of the shell.
L and M occur is every limpet stimulated. Although R and F components
occurred with less frequency than L and M, they too are important elements
of the behavior. Rotation generally turned the limpet away from the tube
foot stimulus (See also below). Fleeing served to move the limpet still
farther away.
Limpets placed in a flow of water which had run over a starfish
upstream also invariably display the mantle response. The time scale in
which they react is on the order of minutes (Figure 4). The reaction occurs
between two and twelve minutes - a much longer time frame than that required
for response to tube foot stimulation (See also below). Control animals
exposed to an identical flow of sea water which has not flowed over a
starfish do not exhibit this behavior. Neither the experimental group nor
the control group lift, rotate, or flee.
Observations of living starfish in the presence of Fissurella indicate
that the limpet's mantle response stimulates an avoidance reaction by the
starfish. Pisaster's tube feet appear to be repelled by the mantle tissue
upon contact. However, they will grab on to any exposed portion of the
shell.
Time Course of Mantle Extrusion Response
Although all limpets reacted rapidly to contact with a starfish tube
