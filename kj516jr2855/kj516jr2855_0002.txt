INTRODUCTION
A variety of gastropods have adaptive avoidance and escape reactions to
predatory starfish (Bullock, 1953) and react to their predators both upon
contact and at a distance. Detection of the predator is thought to involve
chemoreception. A substance which may be involved in detection was isolated
from Pisaster ochraceus and is most likely attached to proteins within the
tube feet (Feder and Lasker, 1964).
Numerous limpets respond to starfish. The Collisella and Acmaea
limpets have a stereotyped response to tube foot contact: raising the shell,
rocking from side to side, rotation, and fleeing (Bullock,1953). Other
limpets such as Fissurella volcano's relative Diodora aspera exhibit a much
different response. This response consists of extruding mantle tissue from
the outer margin of the shell and out the keyhole to prevent starfish tube
feet from fastening to the limpet shell (Margolin, 1964).
The present study characterizes the response of Fissurella volcano to
contact with Pisaster ochraceus tube feet and to water which had been
exposed to a living starfish. Differences in the escape response in limpets
tested on horizontal vs. vertical surfaces were also studied. In addition,
morphological investigations of the suspected sensory elements were
undertaken.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens were collected at The Great Tide Pool in Pacific Grove,
California during low tides. They were segregated into two groups depending
on the orientation of the surface on which they were found (ie. horizontal
and vertical). Limpets were placed in tanks and maintained on surfaces in
their respective orientations.
