The common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is able to exhibit
a wide yariety of body patterns. Fast studies have analyzed the
animal's ability to camouflage itself using subjective methods.
This study encorporated two objective methods, overall tone
analysis and spatial frequency of pattern analysis, to examine
how well the animal was matching its background. Un its natural
background, sand, the cuttlefish matched both tone and pattern.
On an unnatural background, such as a uniform gray, one animal
matched tone, ame matched pattern and one attempted to match both
tane and pattern. On analysis combining subjective method and
the quantitative methods described in this paper offer a more
definitive method for judging the degree to which the the animal
can match the surrounding environment in behavioral tests.

The cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, has fascinated biologists
because of its ability to change its skin patterns within
fractians of a zecond. Using the brown, yellow and red pigmented
ordans in their skin (chromatophores), which are under neural
control, the cuttlefish are able to exhibit a wide variety of
hody pattemns. For example, cuttlefish use patterns to scare
prey, to attract mates, and to camoflauge themselves. Early
