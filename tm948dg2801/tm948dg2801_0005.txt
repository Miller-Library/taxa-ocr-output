'hpolygon' was used to output gray values within the area covered
by the cuttlefish, and an equal size area on the adjacent
substrate. The function 'hlist' was used to obtain the mean,
standard deviation, miniumum and maximum values, skew and
kurtosis of the histograms of the pixel gray scales from
cuttlefish and background. Each histogram quantatively measures
how well the animal was matches the oyerall tone of the
zubstrate.
A spectral analysis methed was used to determine how well the
cuttlefish were matching pattern. Spectral analysis is oftem
used to interpret time in terms of frequency (Chatfield 1784).
Im this study, it was used to comvert distance in space (on the
hack of the cuttlefish or on the substrate) into spatial
trequency. The result of the analysis is presented as a
speatrum. The abtissa represents the spatial frequency of
periodic pattemns in inverme mm. and the ordinate is the power
spentrum, a measure af the variance in gray scale associated with
mach spatial frequency (Chatfield, 1984).
The function 'profile' was used to draw a transect 9
pixels wide acros the back of the animal and an equal-length
transect through the adjacent substrate. Each pixel corresponds
to a distance in space of .Emm. The gray values obtained were
then transferred tw an IEM XI personal computer. Here, the gray
meale values were filtemed with a high pass digital filtem to
remave the mean and the first five harmonics of the fundamental
spatial frequengy. The filtering was done ta memoye the low
trequency patterns associated with the averall length of the
