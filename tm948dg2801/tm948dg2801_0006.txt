transect on the animal or substrate. Next, the power spectrum of
a Tho pixel series was calculated and smoothed using a nine-point
running average, and the objective measure of pattern matching
was obtained.
RESULTS
Histogram pairs of gray scale (a measure of overall tome).
ame shown in figures 8-13 for each test cuttlefish and its
background. A student t-test was performed on the means of each
pair. Due to the extremely large number of pixels in each
histmgram (n240,000), even a difference in means of one was
statistically significant. However, the human eye can only
distinguish approximately Jo shades of gray (Takahashi, 1986).
Theretere, the human eye can discern a difference in light
intensity only if two regions of the image are more than 7
(2w6/30) apart on the gray scale. The means of the histograms,
them, were comsidered 'different' if the means were farther than
apart.
Un the sand substrate, the difference in means for all three
animals was less than sevem. On the gray substrate, all animals
were greater than 7 gray scale units away from the background
mean. The histogram of the cuttlefish on the rock background was
compared to three other histegrams: that of one rock in the bowl.
the whole area of the bowl and a cuttlefish sised area within the
