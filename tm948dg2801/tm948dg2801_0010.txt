ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to thank Mark Denny and Stuart Thompson for all
their advice, help and most of all, patience, throughout this
quarter. Thanks also to Chris Fatton for all his help in
photography as well as Steve Gaines and Mark Shibata for their
computer help. Hoger Hanlon deserves many thanks for supplying
the cuttlefish, many papers (including his own unpublished work)
and for teaching all of us in the Spring Class in an entertaining
and informative way. Finally, thanks to everyone in Bio 17SH
Hopkins Spring Class for making this quarter nifty!
