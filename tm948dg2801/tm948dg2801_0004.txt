In order to have some way of subjectively judging how well
the cuttlefish matched their background, the pictures of the
cuttlefish in the experimental tank were shown to 12 human
judges' who were asked to rate the cuttlefish's camoutlage
performance on a scale of O (a bad match) to 3 (a good match).
Eody patterns of the animals were classified according to
the system develcped by Hanlon (1984). The five patterne shown
by the animals were:
(1) Uniform light (see figure 2): to an overall light tone with
very few of no dark chromatophores enpanded.
(2) Stipple (see figure 4): an overall uniform tone that is
slightly darker than l due to expansion of dark chromatophor.
(3) Weak dismuptive (see figure 6): a wide variety of patterns,
with the common characteristic that the body is braken into
portions by transverse or lengitudinal elements.
(4) Weak Zebra (see figure 5): a low contrast striped patterm
also calledsandy-tripe' by Holmes (1740).
() Uniform Dark (see figure 3): expansion of all dark
chromatophores.
To objectively measure the animals ability to match its
hackground, the various slides were then digitized using a
MegaVision 1OE4-XM computer and a Panasonic black and white vided
camera, By selecting the function 'tyscannem' the colour slides
T y  array of pixels with
werestored in the computer in a
mach pixel assigned a value on a gray scale of 25 ( O being the
blatkesta-
eing the whitest). The gray scaleof the
Hegalision was fpund to be linear at all but the darkest and
whitest gray values (see figure 7). The Megavision function
