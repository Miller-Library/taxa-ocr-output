bowl. The cuttlefish judged the most difficult to see matched
(difference in means 47) a rock in the bowl, but not overall tome
or a cuttlefish-sied area in the bowl. Conversely, the mean of
the histogram of the animal yoted most visible did not match any
of the means.
The results of the spectral analysis are shown in tigures
14-17. The cuttlefish and its background are plotted on thesame
zet of axes. All the spectra exhibit a large peak corresponding
to a spacing of 23.T mm. This peak was theught to be an artifact
uf the filtering process and was therefore not included in the
analysis. The cuttlefish which closely match their substrate
according to the zubjective judging, show that the pattern
spacings are within .omm, at most. Those cuttlefish judged nat
to be matching have harmonics that differ by more than twoee
animal +).
IhE power spectra also compare the variance of the transect
on the cuttlefish with that of the background. Cuttletisn
photographed on sand show less variance than the substrate. The
animals phatographed on the gray background show greater variance
than the suhstrate, while those compared to the rack hackground
mhow mither more or less variance than the mock aubstrate. he
variance exhibited on the mocks does nat ampear to be asmociated
with an individual animal or the trial, as each individual showed
greater or leszer variance at different times.
Ihe resulte of the individual animals body pattern choite is
aummari zed in the bar graphs om hoth rack and gray substrates.
