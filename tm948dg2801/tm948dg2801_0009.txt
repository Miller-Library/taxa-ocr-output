pattern and tome it will show. Evidently, the neural circuitry
involved in chromatophore response is not "hard-wired".
Similarly, the same cuttlefish does not always respond the
same way to the same background (see figure 20). With the
exception of S on the gray substrate, each of the three animals
exhibited at least two different body patterns when placed on the
same substrate repeatedly. Moreover, the patterns did not depend
on how many times the cuttlefish had seen the particular
zubstrate before.
Ihis study demonstrates a method for quantifying matching.
Uverall tone of the animal can be quantified using a digital
image processor and pattern matching can be cbjectively
determined by the power spectra. This objective, quantative
method is especially powerful for judging matching on uniform
mubstrates such am sand or the light gray background. Subjective
analysis is still necessany, especially on a complex substrate
(like a rock background), where it is not always evident how the
amimal is trying to camouflage itself. Subjective analysis and
the two cbjective methods outlined above, together provide a good
basis for judging how well, and how, cuttlefish match their
sumstrate, and the different strategies they use.
