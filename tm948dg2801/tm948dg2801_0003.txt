data in an accurate, rapid and reproducable manner (lnoue, 1786).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sepia were hatched in Galveston, Texas and brought to
Hopkins Marine Station, Facific Grove, Ca. at around A menthe ot
age. The animals used were between four and five monthe old at
the time of testing. Typical mantle length of the animals was a
cm. The three animals used for the study were kept in shaded,
individual aquaria with running sea water  15" C. Fictures of
individual animals were taken on three different backgrounds: (1)
amall grained sand substrate, (E) a uniform light gray background
and (S) a mock mubstrate cantaining rocks approkimately the mame
zite as the animal, but in a variety of tomes. In an experimental
tank, the test animal was placed in a 17 cm bowl containing of
gne of the three substrates and given five minutes to aclimate.
Fictures of the cuttlefish were taken with a m Wikon camera
and twa electric flashes held on stands om sither side ot the
tank. Ektachrome 100 alide film was used. The camera was tastened
th a trippd approkimately mne meter above the tank. Since evem
slight movement often seemed to bother the animals, the pictures
were taken in a darkemed room and I stayed sitting quietly beside
the tank fom the five minutes before the pictures were taken.
