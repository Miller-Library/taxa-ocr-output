more than one pattern when confronted with the same substrate.
Un both the rock and gray substrates, five different body
patterns were used. Similar bar graphs for the sand trials were
not made, since all the animals matched the sand substrate well.
and all showed the same overall body pattern.
DISCUSSION
Cuttletish on the sand substrate are able to match both tone
and pattern and are subjectively well camouflaged. Since sand is
the natural habitat of the animal it seems logical that all the
animals would be able to match the sand backorpund best. When
contronted with an unnatural substrate, rocks or gray, the
cuttletish use various strategies to conceal themselyes. On the
gray background, animal  matched the uniform pattern well, but
was highly visible because of lack of tone matching, (see figure
3) Animal  matched the overall tone of the gray backargund to
within one shade of gray, but displayed a pattern that was highly
visible. (see figure 4) Animal  matched tone to within 5 shades
as well as matching pattern.
he results on the rock substrate also indicate that
different strategies can be used by the same individual.
Individuals employ at least five different body patterns to
mamoutlaque themselves on the unnatural substratee, Thus, when
placed on an unfamiliar or unnatural background, the cuttlefish
have the ability to respond in a variety of ways. The animal is
able to examine his environment and then able to chosse the
