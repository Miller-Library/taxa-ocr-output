It was necessary to determine the pH optima of the
enzymes before further investigation; therefore, a series
of buffers, a 0.05 M citrate-phosphate buffer over the

pH range 4.0 to 7.1, a 0.1 M phosphate buffer over the
range 7.2 to 7.8, a 0.05 M veronal-HCl buffer over the
range 7.6 to 8.9, and a 0.05 M glycine-NaÖH buffer over
the range 8.6 to 12, were used. Three activity peaks
