A solution containing 7 uM of BPA was made. Eight Falcon polystyrene test tubes were
filled with 10 mL of control samples each. Another eight tubes were filled with embryos
exposed to 7uM of BPA. The 16 tubes were placed on a rocker table for 1 hour at room
temperature. Then, every 15 minutes, one control and one experimental sample were taken and
centrifuged in a hand-crank low-speed centrifuge such that the embryos settled at the bottom of
the test tubes. The liquids from the two tubes were aspirated. 5 mLs of Carnoys solution (1 part
glacial acetic acid: 3parts ethanol) was added to both tubes, and the samples were placed on a
test tube rack at room temperature. This process was repeated until all eight sets of zygotes were
fixed in Carnoys.
After approximately 24 hours, the Carnoys solution was aspirated from all test tubes. All
zygotes were placed in 45% acetic acid for about 30 minutes. The acetic acid was then removed
and a solution of 2% acetocarmine with 45% acetic acid was added to all samples. After 10
minutes, the cell samples were placed on a slide under a phase microscope and examined for
chromosome arrangement.

Part one: does BPA affect the life stage schedule of S. purpuratus embryos up to the late
prism stage!
A vast majority of S. purpuratus embryos were able to grow to at least the late prism
stage in BPA concentrations less than or equal to 1 uM. At concentrations greater than 3 uM,
