Bisphenol A causes disruptions in the cell cycle of the zygotes and embryos
of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
Abstract
Bisphenol A (BPA), a common chemical found in polycarbonate plastic containers, is
suspected to damage animal health. While many studies on BPA have been done on terrestrial
vertebrate models, few have been conducted on marine invertebrates. Because BPA is found in
harbours, it is important to find out if we need to be concerned about BPA pollution of the
marine ecosystem. This study examines the effects of BPA on the early development of the
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The results show that the vast majority of the
embryos develop normally when exposed to concentrations at or below 1 uM up to the late prism
stage; a few exogastrulating embryos appear as a result of BPA exposure, but the number of
exogastrulating embryos does not increase with increasing concentration. BPA inhibits
formation of the blastocoel in S. purpuratus embryos at concentrations greater than 1 uM. At
concentrations greater than 5 uM, BPA significantly delays cell division, apparently affecting the
mitotic apparatus of the zygote and preventing chromosomes from condensing and migrating
properly. The concentrations used in this study are orders of magnitude higher than what has
