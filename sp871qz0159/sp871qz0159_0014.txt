This study is one of the few that focuses on the effects of bisphenol A on aquatic
organisms, and possibly the first that explores the effects of BPA on the early development of a
marine invertebrate species. The findings raise questions regarding the action of BPA on
different model systems, and prompt further investigation on the mechanisms and concentration
ranges through which BPA affects animal and human health.
