no zygote in the experimental group divided in 2.5 hours, whereas at least some divided in the
control group.
Discussion
The experiments demonstrate that S. purpuratus embryos are able to develop normally up
to the late prism stage in BPA concentrations up to 1 uM. At concentrations equal and above 3
UM, BPA delays development, inhibits blastocoel formation, delays cell division, and affects
chromosome arrangement during mitosis. However, concentrations up to 10 uM of BPA are not
immediately lethal, and abnormal embryos continue to experience cell division despite the
failure to form the blastocoel until at least 70 hours after fertilization.
The individual exogastrulates are difficult to explain. None existed in the control group.
but the number of exogastrulates did not increase significantly with increasing concentration. As
the exogastrulates were greatly in the minority, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the
effects of BPA on exogastrulation. It would be helpful to repeat each part of the experiment a
few more times and perform them in a more streamlined, consistent way.
Compared to past studies and publications, some of the results from this study are
surprising. Hunt et al concluded that â€œlow-dose BPA exposure... is sufficient to cause meiotic
abnormalities." (Hunt et al, 2003) Hunt et al fed the mice bisphenol A at 20, 40, or 100 ngg
body weight/day for 6-8 days preceding oocyte analysis. To determine the shortest exposure that
produced detectable effects, another set of experiments using a dose of 20 ng BPA/g body
weight for 3, 5, or 7 days prior to oocyte analysis was conducted. From these experiments, Hunt
et al concluded that BPA causes aneuploidy in the oocytes of female mice even at low doses.
