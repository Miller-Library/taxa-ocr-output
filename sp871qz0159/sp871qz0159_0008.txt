however, 100 % of the embryos failed to develop a blastocoel and to make it past the morula
stage. At concentrations above 25 uM, embryos lysed and died early at the 1-cell stage.
Concentrations of 3 uM, 6 uM, and 10 uM caused development to be delayed. Problems
with cell division were seen in the 3 uM group at 2 hours after fertilization, when the zygotes
were going through the first cleavage. Many of the zygotes exposed to 3 uM had various
problems such as asynchronous cell division, wrong number of cells, and incomplete cytokinesis.
The developmental progress of the 6 uM, and 10 uM groups was delayed further than the 3 uM
group, and the morphological abnormalities were more prominent. At 2 hours after fertilization,
there were some normal-looking zygotes at the 2-cell stage in the 3 uM group, but none in the
groups exposed to 6 uM of BPA or more.
Even though embryos exposed to 3 uM, 6 uM, and 10 uM of BPA displayed delays and
abnormalities at 2 hours after fertilization, their cells continued to divide abnormally and many
survived till at least the third day after fertilization. At 76 hours, some embryos exposed to 10
UM of BPA were swimming, even though they were dumbbell shaped and completely abnormal
There were no exogastrulates in the control groups. In all experimental groups up to 1
UM, there were a few exogastrulating individuals. The number of exogastrulates and the degree
of exogastrulation did not seem to vary significantly with varying concentrations.
Part two: does BPA affect the cell division schedule
Given the above observation that BPA concentrations at greater than 3 uM delay
development, a study was conducted to see if BPA delays cell-division. It was observed that at
about 2 hours after fertilization, the control, 1 uM, and 3 uM groups were all predominantly at
