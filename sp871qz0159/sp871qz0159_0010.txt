made it impossible to clearly discern the morphology of the cells, and all the samples started
appearing similar to one another. At this point, the experiment was halted.
Part three: how does BPA affect cell division
In this third study, I examined in more detail the inhibition of cell division. At first the
control and experimental group appeared similar. (Fig. 2 and 3) At about 1.75 and 2 hours after
fertilization, the chromosomes in some of the zygotes in the control group began to organize in
two sets, lined up, and migrated to one side of the zygote. The chromosomes of all zygotes in
the experimental group still appeared scattered and more near the center of the zygote. (Fig. 4)
At 2.25 and 2.5 hours after fertilization, some of the zygotes in the control group showed clear
division and arrived at the 2-cell stage, whereas no 2-cell stage zygotes could be found in the
experimental group. In the control group, two sets of chromosomes could be seen in some
zygotes, but in all experimental zygotes only one set of chromosomes could be seen. (Fig. 5 and
The result from this part of the experiment was problematic in that not all zygotes in the
control group divided. In the samples where the zygotes did divide, the cleavage furrow was
often difficult to discern, making visualizing two sets of chromosomes the only indication of cell
division. Oftentimes, only one set of chromosome was found in the zygotes of the control group,
which was possibly confounded by the fact that the fixing and staining technique described did
not yield extremely clear images of the chromosomes. Nonetheless, there was a difference in
chromosome morphology between the control and experimental groups. It was significant that
