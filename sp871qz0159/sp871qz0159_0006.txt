Fertilized zygotes were placed in covered glass petri dishes containing 10 mL of sea
water and various concentrations of BPA ranging from O.1 uM to 1 mM. The control group was
kept in the same kind of petric dishes with the same volume of sea water, but without any BPA.
Sperm from three males were used to fertilize the eggs of one female. Thus, for each
concentration of BPA, there were three samples total. The zygotes were checked by light
microscopy at 15 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 20 hours, 23 hours, 46 hours, 49 hours, and
70 hours after fertilization. In between sampling, the embryo cultures were left in a cold room
maintained at 16 °C.
When this part of the experiment was repeated, fertilized zygotes were placed in glass
test tubes that were covered with parafilm. The test tubes rested on a rack in the 16 C cold
room.
Part two: does BPA affect the cell division schedule
The experiment was conducted in glass test tubes containing control, 1 uM, 3 uM, 5 uM,
and 7 uM of BPA. The other conditions were the same as those described in Part One. Pure
DMSO was diluted 100 times with filtered seawater and added to the control group, such that the
control group had the same amount of diluted DMSO as the sample with the highest amount of
BPA. Fertilized embryos were added to each test tube and checked using light microscopy about
every 30 minutes until the control group arrived at the morula stage.
Part three: BPA’s effect on chromosome appearance during the first cleavage
