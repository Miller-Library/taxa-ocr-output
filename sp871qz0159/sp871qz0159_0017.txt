Fig. 1 Some anomalies caused by xenobiotics during the first cleavage: A: normal
cleavage; B: slightly asynchronous cell cycles of the 2 blastomeres; C 2 unequal
blastomeres, incomplete cleavage; D: three blastomeres, of different sizes. (Y. Yokota et
al, 2000. p. 84) Many of the embryos in experimental groups with BPA concentration
equal to or greater than 3uM have morphologies resembling B-D at the 2-cell stage.
Effects most prominent in groups with concentration greater than 5 uM.
Fig. 2. Control and experimental zygotes fixed in Carnoys and stained with acetocarmine
at 35 minutes after fertilization.
The experimental group is exposed to 7uM of BPA
Note the similarities between the two zygotes, and the fact that chromosomes were not
readily visible.
Fig. 3. Control and experimental zygotes fixed in Carnoys and stained with acetocarmine
at 1.25 hours after fertilization. Not much difference can be discerned between the two
groups. Chromosomes scattered near the middle of the zygote in both groups.
Fig 4. Control and experimental zygotes 2 hours after fertilization. Note the lining up of
the chromosomes in the control group, and the scattering of the chromosomes in the
experimental sample.
Fig 5. Control and experimental zygotes 2.25 hours after fertilization. Note the cleavage
furrow in the control group. The control group also has two sets of chromosomes. The
chromosomes in the experimental sample is still scattered.
Fig 6. Control and experimental zygotes 2.5 hours after fertilization. The control sample
pictured is almost ready to enter the 4-cell stageâ€”the two sets of chromosomes are lined
up to divide again. The experimental, in contrast, dwells in the 1-cell stage. Its
chromosomes are still scattered and not lined up, showing that the cell is still at prophase.
