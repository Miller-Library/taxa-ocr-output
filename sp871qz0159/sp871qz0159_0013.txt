Furthermore, concentration that affects the early development of sea urchins is different from the
concentrations that affect any of the rodent species in the aforementioned studies. Because
marine life is extremely diverse, one must take care when attempting to extrapolate the sea
urchin embryo data to other species.
The environmental relevance of the concentrations used in my sea urchin embryo study
should also be discussed. In an environmental study on BPA, the brother and sister team of
Fatima Olea, a food toxicologist, and Nicolas Olea, a physician specializing in endocrine
cancers, found BPA in canned vegetables at 80 parts per billion. "At such levels," wrote Theo
Colborn and her co-authors of Our Stolen Future, “a synthetic estrogen mimic might contribute
significantly to a person’s exposure regardless of whether it is a "weak" estrogen or not.'
(Colborn et al, 1996) 80 ppb of BPA was cause for human health concerns. However, assuming
that canned vegetables are mostly made of water, 80 ppb of BPA translates into a concentration
of 3.504 x 10 M, nearly an order of magnitude lower than the concentration that inhibited
blastocoel formation in S. purpuratus embryos.
While the report by Hosokawa et al did not mention the concentration of BPA that was
found in harbors, it is unlikely that marine concentrations of BPA would exceed that found in
manufactured foods. Thus, the fact that 3 uM of BPA inhibits blastocoel formation in sea urchin
embryos may not be environmentally relevant, as marine life forms are probably not likely to
encounter such high concentrations. Sea urchin embryos show considerable tolerance to 1 uM of
BPA up to the prism stage, demonstrating the robustness of early embryos. However, it is
unclear whether early exposure to BPA would affect later development. It would be important to
conduct future experiments by using lower concentrations, by culturing the embryos to later life
stages, and by using other marine model organisms.
