been found in the environment, indicating that BPA may not be of concern in marine
ecosystems.
Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) is gaining attention for its ability to interfere with the health of
animals. It is a common industrial chemical, found in polycarbonate plastics that are used for lab
flasks, animal cages, and many consumer products such as drinking water jugs and bottles.
(Colborn et al, 1996) As a xenoestrogen, BPA is many orders of magnitude less potent than
estradiol. (Milligan et al, 1998) However, according to David Feldman, a professor of medicine
in the endocrinology division of the Stanford School of Medicine, it "still has activity in the parts
per billion range." (Colborn et al, 1996) BPA is also present in relatively high concentrations-
as high as eighty parts per billionâ€”in canned foods, such as canned corn, artichokes, and peas.
(Colborn et al, 1996)
A number of studies have been done on terrestrial vertebrate model organisms to
ascertain the health-damaging effects of BPA, some with seemingly conflicting results. Masaru
Furuya et al showed that dietary BPA at 200 mg per rooster per week feminizes roosters. (Furuya
et al, 2003) According to a multi-generation study conducted by Rochelle Tyl et al, dietary BPA
did not significantly damage the health of Sprague-Dawley rats or the health of their offsprings.
(Tyl et al, 2002) A study on mice by Patricia Hunt et al, however, demonstrated that BPA causes
meiotic aneuploidy in the oocytes of female mouse. (Hunt et al, 2003) Possibly related to this,
Lehmann and Metzler concluded that Bisphenol A interferes with microtubules in cultured
human fibroblasts. (Lehmann and Metzler, 2003) In a study on a variety of chemicals suspected
