Materials and Methods
General protocols common to all three parts of the experiment
A O.1M stock solution of bisphenol A was made in DMSO, stored at room temperature in
a covered graduated cylinder, and shielded from light with tin foil. All dilutions of the stock
solution were done using filtered seawater.
Sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were induced to spawn by injection with
approximately 1 mL of O.5M potassium chloride into the coelomic cavity. Females were placed
upside-down on top of a small beaker (beaker diameter smaller than the diameter of the urchin)
filled with sea water, such that eggs fell to the bottom of the beaker. The eggs were stored in the
cold room at 16 °C and could be used for about two days. Sperm was pipetted from the dorsal
side of the males directly into an eppendorf tube and stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C.
The density of zygotes in the culture was low such that the zygotes would not get anoxic
To achieve this, about 0.2 mL of super-concentrated egg suspension was diluted in a beaker
containing 500 mL of filtered sea water. Fifteen minutes after 5 uL of sperm was added to the
eggs in BPA-free sea water, the eggs were checked under the microscope to see if they possessed
the fertilization envelope. If more than 90% of the eggs were fertilized, they were exposed to
control and experimental conditions, described below.
Part one: does BPA affect the developmental schedule of S. purpuratus embryos up to the
late prism stage?
