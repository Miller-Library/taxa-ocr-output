to cause aneuploidy, Parry et al demonstrated that bisphenol A induces aneuploidy in Chinese
hamster V79 cells at 14 ug/ml. There was a dose-dependent increase in the frequencies of both
abnormal metaphases and all mitotic aberrations when those cells were exposed to BPA. Parry
et al concluded that BPA may interact with components of the centrosomes which make up the
poles of the mitotic spindle. (Parry et al, 2002)
Less attention has been paid to how BPA affects organisms in aquatic systems. In one
study by H. Segner et al on the freshwater zebrafish, Danio rerio, BPA was shown not to be a
potent xenoestrogen. (Segner et al, 2003) However, no BPA study has been conducted on
marine invertebrate model organisms, despite the fact that a nationwide investigation of
endocrine disruptors in Japanâ€™s harbors, conducted by Hosokawa et al, found BPA in at least
thirty percent of the sites surveyed. (Hosokawa et al, 2003)
It is thus relevant to examine the effects of bisphenol A on a marine invertebrate model
organism in order to ascertain whether the scientific community and policy makers need to be
concerned about BPA pollution of marine systems. The studies by Hunt, Lehmann and Metzler,
and Parry suggest that it is worthwhile to examine the effects of BPA on cell division. The
experiments described below were designed to examine how BPA affects cell division and
differentiation in the early development of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The
results show that BPA at concentrations above 5 uM disrupts S. purpuratus development by
affecting mitosis even at the fertilized one-cell stage. Embryos exposed at 3 uM of BPA divide
slower than the controls and never form the blastocoel, possibly due to disruptions of the mitotic
apparatus. In contrast, embryos exposed to 1 uM of BPA or less develop normally till at least
the late prism stage.
