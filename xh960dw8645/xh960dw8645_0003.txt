Substrate preparation A water-soluble, polyoxyethylene
derivative of sorbitan mono-oleate, commercially known
as Tween 80 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri)
was used as substrate. The Tween 80 to be used as
substrate was diluted to 50% with water and titrated
with 17% phosphoric acid to the desired pH. All measure-
ments of hydrogen ion concentration were made with a
Beckman zeromatic pH meter.
Enzyme assay The procedure followed was essentially that
of Archibald (1). Three ml. of 50% neutralized Tween 80,
0.5 ml. of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 0.5 ml. of the
enzyme preparation were placed in a 15 ml. centrifuge
tube, thoroughly mixed with a glass stirring rod and
incubated for 1 hour. After incubation, 1.0 grams of
reagent-grade NapHÃ¸P04-H20 and 10 ml. of ether mixture
" 5:1) were added.
(diethyl ether, petroleum ether, b.p.
Simultaneously, a blank was prepared containing all of the
components of the assay mixture prepared immediately prior
to extraction with ether. After mixing and centrifugation
for 10 minutes at 4000 r.p.m., the ether layer containing
the released fatty acids was withdrawn and placed in a
30 ml. beaker. The ether was removed by evaporation after
the addition of O.5 ml. 2-methyl-2, 4-pentanediol (J.T.
Baker Chemical Co, Phillipsburg, New Jersey). The vis-
cous residue was then titrated with O.Ol N NaoH to the
original pH.
Lipase activity was estimated in terms of milli-
equivalents of acid produced per hour. Activity was
determined by the use of the following equation: A -
D - C / 100 T where D is ml. of 0.O1 N NaoH used in
titration of the reaction mixture, C is ml. of NaoH used
in titration of the blank, and T is the reaction time in
hours.
