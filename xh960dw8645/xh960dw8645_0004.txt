RESULTS
Direct measurement of the gut contents revealed
a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration from the fore-
gut (pH 5.5) to the hindgut and hepatopancreas (pH 7.4).
The gut exhibited a relatively negligible amount of li-
pase activity compared to that found in the hepatopan-
creas (0.16 milliequivalents of acid / hour / 0.05 gram
of dehydrated, defatted tissue at pH 7.2, 23.5 C). For
this reason, further experiments were carried out using
hepatopancreatic extracts only.
Figure 1 illustrates the finding that lipase
activity in P. granosimanus increases with increasing
pH to approximately 7.2.
It can be seen in Figure 2 that lipase activity
varies with temperature and that its optimum temperature
is approximately 35C.
The effects of variations in substrate concentraÂ¬
tion upon lipase activity in P. granosimanus are presented
in Figure 3. Activity increases with increasing substrate
concentration to a maximum at approximately 2.16 grams
Tween / 0.05 grams of dehydrated, defatted tissue extract.
The relative concentration of substrate used in the above
studies was in excess of this amount.
The lipase preparation was labile, losing approx-
imately 60% of its activity after sitting for only two
hours at room temperature (23 C).
DISCUSSION
Although esterases which attack simple ester link-
ages are found in many animal tissues, lipases appear to
