Examination of the gut contents of the hermit
crab Pagurus revealed both algae and many types of ani-
mal foodstuffs. In view of the varied diet of Pagurus,
it would seem probable that its digestive system contained
enzymes capable of hydrolyzing carbohydrates, proteins
and fats. Although the ability to hydrolyze fats had
been demonstrated in other Crustacea (2) (6), a study
remained to be done in Pagurus. The experiments here out-
lined are designed to determine lipase activity—its
distribution and optimal conditions, in the genus Pagurus
MATERIALS AND METHOD
Pagurus granosimanus, as the largest of the
species common to the intertidal zone surrounding the
Hopkins Marine Station, was selected as representative
of the genus. The crabs used were collected at nearby
Pinos Point and had an average wet weight of one gram.
Preparation of enzyme The hepatopancreas were removed
from forty P. granosimanus, dehydrated in acetone for
two hours and defatted in petroleum ether for an addi-
tional two hours. (In the case of the gut, sixty indi¬
viduals were necessary.) The dehydration and defatting
were carried out a 5°C. One gram of this residue was
ground to a fine powder in a mortar and extracted at
5°C in 100 ml. of 50% aqueous glycerol for twenty-four
hours. The filtered extract was used as the source of
enzyme.
