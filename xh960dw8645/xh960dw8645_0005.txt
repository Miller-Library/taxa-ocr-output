be confined to the pancreas and intestinal tract (4). No
attempt was made to measure lipase activity in tissues
other than those associated with the digestive tract.
Digestive enzymes in Crustacea have been reported
to have their pH optima in the slightly acid ranges (7),
but it has been shown that with progressing purification
of enzyme preparations, optima tend to move from lower
to higher pH (3). In studies where lipase activity was
greatest in the acid range, the gut contents were also
slightly acid whereas some gut contents of P. granosi-
manus are slightly alkaline.
That the optimal temperature range for the lipase
preparation should exist at about 35 C is in approximate
agreement with that of 28 C found for glycerol-extracted
pancreatic lipase described by Schwartz (8). The obser-
vation of extreme temperature lability of lipase prepara-
tions has been noted before (see 9).
SUMMARY
Optimum pH, temperature and substrate concen-
tration were determined for the hepatopancreatic lipase
present in Pagurus granosimanus.
1. The pH optimum was 7.2.
2. An optimal temperature of approximately 35 C was
demonstrated.
3. Highest activity was reached at a substrate concen-
tration of 0.432 grams Tween per ml. of lipase ex-
tracted from 0.05 gram tissue.
