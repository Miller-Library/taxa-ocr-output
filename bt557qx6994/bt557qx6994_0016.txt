survive (Schmitz et al, 2003). This further supports an important Mg2 regulatory
pathway in the TRPM7. In addition, overexpression of TRPMT in many different types of
cells is also lethal (Nadler, 2001). This perhaps indicates that the overexpressed
channels result in an imbalance in intracellular Mg2“. Further evidence of Ma?
homeostatic regulation in TRPM7 come from studies of the close relative TRPM6.
where it was found that TRPMG is vital in magnesium reabsorption. Patients who have
an inherited form of hypomagnesema were found to have mutations in TRPM6,
Chubanov et al. (2004) suggests an interaction of TRPM6 and TRPM7 to form a
functional complex at the cell surface for regulation of magnesium. Further studies are
needed to understand how heteromers of TRPM6 and TRPMT may affect regulation of
magnesium homeostasis in the cell.
Magnesium homeostasis is crucial to life. Understanding regulation of Mg“
through the TRPMT channel aids in studies of pharmaceutical drugs that may alter the
function of TRPMT to selectively allow for rapid Mg“ uptake into the cells. Drugs that
can inhibit or stimulate activity of this ion channel may be able to help to manage or
even stop certain diseases. The fact that TRPMT is a significant entry pathway for Ca¬
in a Mg“-free extracellular environment may imply mechanisms cellular dysfunction in
people suffering from magnesium deficiency. Considering the possible vital role that
TRPM7 plays in magnesium homeostasis, those suffering from magnesium deficiency
may experience an increase in Ca“ influx that is normally blocked by the presence of
Mg“. Both the decrease in intracellular Mg“ and the subsequent increase in Ca¬
above homeostatic levels may lead to negative effects in the cells.
