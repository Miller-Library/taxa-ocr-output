competitive interaction for absorption of Mg* and Ca2, such that Mg2" strongly
decreases the Ca“ influx. Monteilh-Zoller et al (2003) found the affinities of TRPM7 to
a number of divalent cations, with Mg“ affinity in the middle of the range, and Ca?
affinity at the lowest end. But considering the high concentration of both Mg2t and Ca?
in the extracellular, in comparison to miniscule amounts of trace metals, these two jons
probably out-compete the trace metals. The higher affinity of TRPMT to Mg2 indicates
that Mg“ does not necessarily block the TRPMT channel, but rather out-competes Ca¬
for binding site within the channel. Thus, under physiological conditions, the channel is
more specifically targeted towards magnesium, as well as allowing an entry way for
trace metals, since TRPM7-mediated trace metal entry were also found to occur at
physiological levels of Ca“ and Mg“ (Monteilh-Zoller et al, 2003). In addition,
considering that Gd“ inhibits Ca“ influx in a Mg“-free solution, it would be interesting
to conduct further research on the possibility of a Gd“ block on Mg* influx under normal
physiological conditions.
Previous research shows Ca““ influx is blocked by O.6mM internal Mg2t, during
which channel allows efflux of monovalent ions. Therefore, it seems that both internal
and external Mg“ levels act in a complementary manner to block Ca2* influx. In
addition, Schmitz showed that millimolar concentrations of internal Mg“ completely
blocked the inward current through TRPM7, which also blocks Mg“ influx. The negative
feedback loop therefore allows homeostatic regulation of Mg“ through TRPM7. The
importance of TRPMT in regulation of Mg“ influx is shown in knockout experiments
where the absence of TRPMT resulted in cell death. In addition, in the same study
knockout cells that were introduced with supplemental amounts of Mg“ were able to
