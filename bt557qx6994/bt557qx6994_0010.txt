characterized by a rapid fluorescence rise to a maximum of 222.4 + 12.1% (means +
SEM, n=24) that of the basal fluorescence level. By contrast, fluorescence increase in
the non-induced cells reach a maximum of 106.14 + 6.7% (n-24) that of the basal level
which is a mere 6.14% increase from the basal level. Therefore, the overexpression of
TRPMT in the induced cells significantly contributes to calcium influx (p-0.0002),
Considering the possibility of dye fade, the 6.14% fluorescence increase in the non¬
induced cells is significant to show that the other calcium channels present in the non¬
induced cells are also contributors to the intracellular Ca“ influx. The gradual decrease
in fluorescence rate of increase results from saturation of all channels. Evidence of a
gradual plateau in fluorescence level is present towards the end of the time series.
20 UM Gd“ blocks Ca2 influx
lo assess the possibility of an external block by Gd"", we exposed induced cells
to a series of experimental runs in a schematic order. First, we tested the fluorescence
change of induced cells from an initial bathing solution with OmM Ca2*/ OmM Mg2t/OuM
Gd“, to a testing solution of 2mM Ca2*/ OmM Mg2t/OuM Gd3. This fulfills one
experimental run. Next, the cells washed out with the OmM Ca2*/ OmM Mg27/OUM Gd¬
and tested with a solution of 2mM Ca2/ OmM Mg2720uM Gd“' to observe the Gd
effects. To control for variations between cells, we analyzed fluorescence changes
analysis on the same cells going through the different test solutions. With the
introduction of the 2mM Ca“ solution with O uM Gd“', fluorescence rose to a maximum
of 225.93+- 19.85% (n=6), which is consistent with the experiment testing ca influx
through the induced cells. However, when 20uM Gd“ was added to the Ca2* solution,
