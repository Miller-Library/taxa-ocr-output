ABSTRACT:
The family of TRP ion channels constitutes a fairly recent set of cation channels found
in almost all cell types, with diverse roles ranging from mediating responses of nerve
growth factors to regulation of temperature and vasorelaxation of blood vessels. Such a
plethora of functions also reflect diverse permeability to ions. In this study, the specific
member TRPM7 is tested to understand its role in calcium regulation. As an initial test
of the possibility that TRPM7 channels contribute to regulation of Ca2 influx, [Ca2) was
measured by the fluorescent Ca“ indicator, Fluo-3-AM, using confocal laser microscopy
In cells in which TRPMT channel expression was induced and the cells were perfused
with Ca“ -free solution, restoration of extracellular Ca“ (2mM) caused marked
increases in [Ca“1; whereas non-induced cells did not show much change in [Ca2tl
From the proportion of Ca“ that is taken into the cell, it is plausible that TRPMT is a vital
mode of Ca“ entry. A second test looked at the effects of Gd" (20uM) on Ca2 influx.
The introduction Gd““ quenched fluo-3 fluorescence, indicating that Gd" blocked
conductance of Ca“ through the TRPMT channel. A final experiment was conducted to
analyze the effects of adding Mg“. Results indicate that the addition of extracellular
Mg“ (2mM) reduces Ca“ influx. This shows an interaction of both internal and external
Mg“ in the regulation of TRPM7 in blocking Ca2* influx and in allowing Mg2 influx.
Importance of magnesium regulation is indicative of a role for TRPMT in magnesium
homeostasis.
