Mg“ plays a unique role in the cell by attaching to ATP, thus providing a Mg-ATP
form that is used by most enzymes in important processes such as proliferation and
differentiation (Wolf, 2004). Therefore, proper levels of Mg“ is critical to cellular function.
Although studies have been conducted to measure Mg“' uptake into the cell, the
particular proteins involved in the process are not clearly understood. Understanding
the mechanisms involved in magnesium homeostasis will aid in the development of
pharmaceutical drugs that target symptoms of magnesium deficiency (such as chronic
fatigue syndrome) and diseases that may be treated with an extra boost of magnesium.
For instance, preeclampsia is a serious condition developed by women in late
pregnancy, and results in high blood pressure, edema, muscle contractions and even
death if the condition of the woman is not treated. Magnesium sulfate have been used
to provide patients with increased levels of magnesium, which gets taken up by muscle
cells and causes them to relax. But a more effective thereapy, as suggested by
Scharenberg, would be to directly increase the magnesium uptake into cells of the
smooth muscle. Understanding magnesium regulation through the TRPMT may aid in a
drug that activates TRPMT to allow for magnesium influx.
Importance of magnesium is also implicated in studies of TRPM6 channels,
which have similar channel and enzyme characteristics as TRPM7. Konrad et al (2004)
found that when the TRPM6 is mutated, there is both a defect in intestinal magnesium
absorption and renal magnesium conservation, which are characteristic of
hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia. This study stresses the important role
of TRPM6 in magnesium transport. Structural similarities between TRPMT and TRPMG
suggest that TRPMT may also have similar roles.
