the absence of extracellular Mg“. Our results contradict that of Monteilh-Zoller et al
2003, in which it was found that at extracellular concentrations of 2mM Ca2' and 2mM
Mg“, there is significant Ca“ influx through the overexpressing TRPMT.
We also demonstrated the inhibitory effects of both 2mM Mg* and 20 uM Gd3
on Ca“ influx through the TRPM7. Ca“ influx is blocked by Gd", which is a trivalent
cation that commonly blocks mechanoreceptors and Ca“ channels. Considering that
Gd“ has a similar ionic radius to Ca2 (0.938 A as compared to 0.99 A, respectively),
Gd“ perhaps serves as a cation competitor that mimics Ca“ in its binding to the pore of
ion channels (Hamill and McBride, 1996). The finding that Gd" shows a reversibility of
effect indicates that Gd“ does not permanently bind to the competing binding site in the
ion channel. The usage of Gd“ serves as a tool for characterizing the channels, and
for studying the permeability pathways. Our results open up a gateway for further
investigations into the mechanisms of the TRPM7 channel, which may hold broad
implications for the TRP family.
Similar to Gd“, we propose that there may be binding site competition, in which
Mg“ binds to a site in the channel where Ca“ normally binds to. Our results show that
the presence of 2 mM Mg“ significantly inhibits Ca* influx through the TRPM7 channel.
This is consistent with an electrophysiological study, where it was found that at above
micromolar concentrations of external Mg“, the I shape of the monovalent current
through the channel was altered, and inward currents were preferentially blocked
(Kerschbaum et al., 2003). Although Gd“' has a similar magnitude of blocking effect on
the TRPM7, the 2mM Mg“* in combination with 2mM Ca2 is the normal physiological
condition of the cell. Therefore, under physiological conditions, there may be
