1990; Caldwell et al., 1998). It has been shown to prevent atrial fibrillation by blocking
stretch-activated ion channels in astrocytes (Bode et al., 2001). It has also been used
as a contrast enhancer in MRI. Although Gd“ have been shown to block TRPCI and
TRPM4, effects of Gd“ have not been tested with the other TRP sub-families (Clapham
et al, 2002). Furthermore, although TRPMT is not known to be mechanically stimulated.
it does have an affinity for Ca“. Therefore, it is important to study the effects of Gds
which may yield important implications on the characteristics of TRPM7, and its possible
regulatory mechanisms
It is plausible that deviations in TRPM7 function contribute to abnormal Ca?t
Mg- and other metal ion accumulation that may be associated with neurodegenerative
diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimers, and other diseases of Mg“ deficiency.
The study of ion permeability through these channels allows us to understand the
mechanisms through these channels and the important roles they play.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Cell Culture
HEK293 (Human embryonic kidney cell line) cells were transfected with the mTRPM7
gene, and grown on glass coverslips with DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
bovine serum, 10% FBS, blasticidin (5uglmL), and zeocin (0.4 mglmL). These cells
were chosen for their low or null basal expression of TRP genes. TRPM7 expression
was induced 1 day before experimental run by adding 1.5uglmL tetracycline in the
culture medium. Experimental runs were done 25-30 hours postinduction.
