activity has been shown to be modulated by internal Mg“, where -0.6 mM inhibits
TRPM7 currents (Nadler at al., 2003). Not only do the ubiquitous expression of these
channels reflect its vital role, but also the fact that overexpression results in cell death.
In addition, deletion of this channel also results in cell death in certain types of cells,
Therefore, presence of TRPMT serves a vital role in cellular processes, and cracking in
mechanisms of regulation of specific cations would aid in understanding its vital role.
Calcium
Divalent metal ions, such as Ca“ and Mg“, are essential for many metabolic
processes. Ca“ is a ubiquitous intracellular regulator of cellular function, serving as an
important secondary messenger in many cellular processes ranging from contraction
and motility to cell division and cell death. It is present at -100 nM in the intracellular,
which is much lower than the 2 mM concentration found extracellularly. The strict
regulation of intracellular Ca“ indicates that reduced levels, or prolonged exposure to
increased levels of Ca“, result in cell death. Previous studies using voltage clamp
experiments showed that TRPMT is a significant entry pathway for Ca“ (Monteilh-Zoller
et al., 2003). This implies that TRPM7 plays a role in Ca“ regulation. However, the
voltage clamp experiment looked at cation current through the channel, and not
specifically isolating Ca“. This experiment attempts to isolate Ca“ by using a calcium
fluorescent indicator, Fluo-3, in order to specifically analyze Ca2 influx.
