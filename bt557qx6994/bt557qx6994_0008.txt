Solution changes were performed through a hand pipetting (using an electric
pipetter) through one end of the chamber and a suctioning system on the other
end of the chamber. Chamber was kept at 30°C during the experimental run.
Fluo-3 measurements
Olympus Confocal Laser Microscope was used to visualize Fluo-3-loaded cells.
Cells are placed in perfusion chambers (made of plexy-glass). Images were
collected at 2.8 second intervals. Images were displayed on a computer monitor
and recorded during a 28 second baseline period, a 34 second perfusion period
and cells are let to sit in the test solution for the remainder of the time series (until
the end of the 210 second test run).
• Considering that the dissociation value (Ka) may vary in different cellular
environments such as pH, temperature, viscocity, presence of Mg“ and other
ions (Probes.com, 2004), [Ca“jis not calculated using the formula ([Ca2hee-
KalF-Fminl/IFmax-F1) (Kao et al, 1989). Rather, changes in [Ca2'1 (AJC:
24) were
estimated as % AFIFo, which provides a quantitative estimate of the proportion of
fluorescence changes relative to the initial basal fluorescence level that is
distinctive to each cell. To obtain this value, fluorescence at each point in time
(F) is divided by the maximum fluorescence (Fmax) of each specific cell, obtained
from adding ionomycin to the extracellular Ca* solution. This value is then
normalized to the average of the basal fluorescence level Fo (t=O to 28 seconds).
to give us the fluorescence change relative to the basal level. % AFIFo was
