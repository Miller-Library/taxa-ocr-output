Solutions
• Measurements of intracellular changes in fluorescence (as an indicator of Ca2
influx) was carried out using the Ca“ sensitive indicator Fluo-3-AM under a laser
confocal microscope. Cells grown on glass coverslips were transferred to small
petri dish to be loaded with Fluo-3-AM (5uL). Cells are loaded with the dye for 40
minutes at room temperature, then washed for 5 minutes on a rotator. Bathing
solution is a standard solution of the following composition (mM): Nacl 140, KCI
2.8, HEPES NaÖH 10, Caclz 2, MgClz 2, Glucose 10, pH 7.2. Cacl2 and Mgolz
concentrations were adjusted based on the specific experimental test.
Adjustments are as indicated in the text and figure legends. In specific solutions
-2+
of O mM Ca270 mM Mg2, O mM Ca 1z mM Mg2t, 2 mM Ca2t/0 mM Mg2“, Nacl
concentration is adjusted to 145mM to correct for osmolarity
1mM GdCl stock solution was obtained from Dr. Bill Gilly's lab. This was
adjusted to 20uM using the specific Ca“/Mg“ solution in the experimental run.
lo obtain maximum fluorescence for calibration, 1mM ionomycin was added into
ImL of either 2 mM Ca270 mM Mg2 or 2 mM Ca27/2 mM Mg2* solution to obtain
2uM ionomycin solution, which was then added at the end of each experimental
run. Calibration to a maximum fluorescence allows us to look at compare
fluorescence changes between different experimental conditions and between
the induced and non-induced cells
