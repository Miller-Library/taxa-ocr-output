INTRODUCTION
TRPMT
Metal ion transporters play a major role in maintaining the proper concentrations
of important metal ions in the cell, including Ca“ and Mg““. Of recent interest is a newly
discovered group of ion channels, the TRP (transient receptor potential) ion channel
family, which was named after the TRP channel that was first discovered in a
spontaneously occurring Drosophila mutant. In comparison to the wild type, the mutant
expressed only a transient receptor potential to prolonged exposure to bright light. This
resulted from a defect in light-induced Ca“ influx (Montell et al., 2002). Similarity
between all TRP channels is the presence of a six-transmembrane polypeptide
structure that assembles together into tetramers that form cation-permeable pores
(Clapham, 2003). Of particular interest is the TRPM7 cation channels, a member of the
melastatin sub-family that have been shown to have a widespread distribution in many
types of cells, including those of the lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, and brain
(Wolf, 2004). TRPMT is unique as a "bifunctional" protein that forms both an ion
channel and a protein kinase that may be involved in mediating other proteins (Cahalan,
2001). Electrophysiological studies show that TRPMT is a nonselective cation channel
that conducts influx of divalent cations and efflux of monovalent (Cahalan & Kozak,
2003, Monteilh-Zoller et al., 2003, Nadler et al., 2001). However, there is partial
selectivity in the presence of certain physiological conditions. For instance, when both
external Ca“ and Mg“ are removed, there is an inward current that conducts
monovalent cations such as Na’ and K (Cahalan & Kozak, 2003). Also, TRPMT
