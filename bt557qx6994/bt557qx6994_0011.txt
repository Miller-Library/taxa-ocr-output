the maximum fluorescence was 87.48 + 2.51% (n-6) that of the basal level. This is an
approximately 10% less than the basal fluorescence. The decrease shows that not
much Ca“ entered the cells during the experimental run, and the drop in fluorescence is
indicative of dye fade. Gd“, therefore, blocks influx of Ca2' through the TRPMT
channels (p20.0001). Furthermore, In comparison to non-induced cells that have been
exposed to the 2mM ca solution (maximum of 106.15+- 7% (n-24)), the maximum
fluorescence value achieved with the Gd“' block is significantly less (p=0.0188). This
indicates that not only does Gd“ block the TRPM7 channels present in the
overexpressed cells, but may possibly block other Ca“ channels present in the HEK293
cells.
In a second experimental run, we reversed the order of exposure to the Gd¬
block to see if the block is reversible. This is also done to account for confounding
factors due to the order of the experimental manipulation, such as effects on cell
physiology due to prolonged experimental manipulations. Cells were first exposed to a
bathing solution of OmM Ca27 OmM Mg-/OuM Gd“ and then perfused with the testing
solution of 2mM Ca27 OmM Mg-720uM Gd“. Fluorescence increased to a maximum
value of 110+-4.07% (n=6). Thus, reversing the order of the experiment still shows that
Gd° blocks the TRPM7 channel (p50.0001). Compared to the non-induced cells
exposed to just the 2mM Ca solution, this increase is not statistically significant
(p=0.6408). Discrepancies between the significance levels of the Gd“ solution tested
first and the Gd““ solution tested second to the non-induced cells tested with 2mM Ca¬
indicate that further tests need to be conducted to understand how Gd“' may be
affecting other Ca channels in the HEK293 cells. Äfter this, the Gd“t and Ca2t solution
