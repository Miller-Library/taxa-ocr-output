Considering the vital role of magnesium and possible links of magnesium
regulation in the TRPMT channel, recent interests in the TRPMT channel have been
shifted towards its possible role in magnesium homeostasis (Wolf, 2004). TRPMT have
been shown to have a clear role in mediating magnesium uptake into the cells. The
native conductance of TRPM7 was previously identified in Jurkat T Lymphocytes and
RBL Cells, and described as the MagNuM (magnesium-nucleotide-inhibited metal) and
MIC (magnesium-inhibited cation) (Nadler et al., 2001; Hermosura et al., 2002, Prakriya
and Lewis, 2002). Cahalan and Kozak (2003) show that in addition to internal free Mg?
other divalent cations, including Ba2’, Sr2*, Zn2', and Mn2', also inhibited current
through the TRPM7 channel. But considering the higher Mg2 concentration in the cell.
Mg“ has a larger inhibitory effect. Monteilh-Zoller et al (2003) showed that although
TRPMT is nonselective to metal ions, with affinities of Zn2tæ Ni2t »» Ba2t» co2 » Ma
2 Mn“ 2 Sr2 Cde2 Ca“, physiological conditions mainly permit the transport of Mg?
which is one of the main cations present in the extracellular fluid. This study attempts to
shed some light on the relation of TRPM7 and extracellular Mg2t. By studying
interactions of extracellular Mg“ and Ca2 through TRPM7 at physiological
concentrations, we are able to further understand how TRPMT regulates these cations.
Gadolinium
Gd“ is an important trivalent lanthanide that has been used extensively in a
diagnostic manner to study characteristics of ion channels. In particular, Gd" have
been shown to block many mechanically-stimulated ion channels as well as most Ca-
channels, most notably the L-type and N-type calcium channels (Biagi and Enyeart,
