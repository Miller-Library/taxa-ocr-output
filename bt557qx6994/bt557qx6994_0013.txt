Comparing significance of effects between Ca“ influx in the presence of Mg",
Gd“, and in non-induced cells
To assess whether the Mg“ and Gd“tis blocking other channels in the HEK293
cells, an ANOVA comparison was used to test significance of the maximum
fluorescence rise in the cells exposed to 2mM Cal2mM Mg* (n=12), 2mM Ca2 /20uM
Gd“ with Gd“ tested first in order (n=6), 2mM Ca2t /20uM Gd3t with Gd“ tested
second in order (n=6), and the non-induced cells exposed to just 2mM Ca2* (n-24),
Results show no significant effects (p=0.5) when the two Gd“ tests were pooled
together (n=12), indicating that Mg“ and Gd“ perhaps only blocks TRPMT channels.
However, the significance seen in cells that were exposed to Gd“ in the second order
indicate that further tests will need to be done to analyze this effect.
DISCUSSION
Results from this study hold important implications for Ca2 and Mg2t signaling
through the TRPM7 channel. It is shown that the mTRPMT gene, when overexpressed
in HEK293 cell line, is a Ca“ channel that allows Ca2* accumulation in Mg"-free
extracellular environment. Influx of Ca“ was also present in non-induced cells, although
in relatively low amounts. This reflects the presence of other Ca*' channels in the
HEK-293 cells, which also contribute to the increased fluorescence value seen in the
induced cells. However, there is a high significant difference between induced and non¬
induced cells, which indicates that TRPMT offers a substantial entry pathway for Cae in
