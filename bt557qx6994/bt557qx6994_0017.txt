CONCLUSIONS
Under Mg“-free environment, TRPMT shows high affinity to Ca2* influx. However,
rather than an entry pathway for Ca*', TRPMT is more important as a transporter of
Mg- at physiological levels of Ca“ and Mg“. Considering that TRPMT is ubiquitous in
many different types of cells and its role in Mg“ homeostasis, TRPMT may be a critical
to life. Role of TRPM7 in regulation of Mg“ implicates its importance in cellular
metabolism. The study of Mg“ regulation through the TRPMT is a promising avenue for
pharmaceutical drugs that target many types of diseases.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I wish to thank professor Stuart Thompson for his guidance, insightful teachings, and
support. I would also like to acknowledge Arjun Rustagi for his assistance in the
experiments and in using the Igor program, and Chris Patton for his help in fixing my
computer problems.
