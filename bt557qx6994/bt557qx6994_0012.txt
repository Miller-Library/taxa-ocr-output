was washed out with OmM Ca“7OuM Gd“ solution, and fluorescence change was
recorded for the testing solution with just 2mM ca. Fluorescence increased to a
maximum of 221+-13.1% (n=6), indicating that Gd“ effects are reversible (p50.0001).
A comparison of difference in fluorescence changes between cells exposed to
Gd“ first in the experimental run, and cells exposed to Gd" after a test with just the
Ca“ solution has been conducted, reveal that there is significance in the order of Gd'
exposure (p=0.0214). There was a greater influx of Ca“ in cells first exposed with Gd¬
which can be explained by differences in cell biology. Cells exposed to a Gd"-free
solution first experienced a greater decrease in fluorescence from the basal value.
showing that the effects of Gd“ are stronger with earlier experimental manipulation. To
this end, we also analyzed the Ca“ tests in these experimental runs, and found that the
order of these tests were not significant (p-0.8386). Thus, calcium influx into the
TRPMT seems not to be affected by order of exposure to calcium, which indicates that
magnitude of Gd“ effects are fully reversible. We conclude that in a Mg?-free solution.
20 uM Gd° blocks Ca“ influx through TRPMT channel and this block is reversible.
Physiological Mg“ levels impede Ca“ permeation through TRPM7
To test the effects of external Mg“ on Ca influx through TRPM7, cells were
2+„
exposed to a testing solution of 2mM Ca 7zmM Mg“ solution. Fluorescence increased
to a maximum of 96.53 +-3.83% (n=12), in comparison with cells exposed to a solution
of just 2mM Ca“, where the maximum fluorescence increase is 222.4 + 12.1% (n=24).
Comparison between these two testing solutions shows that Mg* significantly blocks
Ca influx (p«O.0001).
