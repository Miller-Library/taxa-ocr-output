obtained for 6 individual cells per experimental run. The Igor Pro 4.09A program
is used for graph displays and data analysis.
To account for differences in cell biology, cells present at different stages of the
cell cycle and differences in dye load, we established a criterion from preliminary
analyses in which cells chosen were most similar in dye load, cellular
characteristics and cellular cycle. Individual cells chosen were based on
similarities in size, shape, basal fluorescence level, and cells were mostly those
that are isolated from other cells, or are only touching one or two cells (to avoid
cellular processes that may affect the cells).
Statistics
Unpaired t-test and single-factor ANÖVA were used to test for statistical
significance. Significance was considered to be less than p=0,05.
RESULTS
TRPMT provides a significant entry pathway for Ca“
To test whether there is a significant Ca“ influx through the TRPMT channel, we
ran an image scan of cells in an initial bathing solution of OmM Ca2*/OmM Mg2. Cells
were then perfused with a test solution of 2mM Ca2/OmM Mg* at 28 seconds into the
experimental run. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the fluorescence changes between
the induced and non-induced cells. In induced cells, the increase in intracellular Ca?
concentration in response to exposure to an external concentration of 2mM Ca2 is
