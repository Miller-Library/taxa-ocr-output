A series of computerized limpet models were generated
and their stresses analyzed using finite element analysis to
determine how a variety of shell morphologies would effect
stress distributions and magnitudes in limpet shells. Various
morphologies can affect stress distribution and magnitude.
Large height to diameter ratios, lowered apices, and apices
positioned in the anterior third of the shell were all
determined to be particularly advantageous morphologies in
reducing overall stresses on the shell (in terms of percent of
breaking stress). In addition, shells with increased
thicknesses at the apex and below the muscle scar were
shown to reduce stress concentrations in these areas. These
findings support data collected by David Lindberg (1981) who
showed that of the 20 California limpet species the majority
have medium to medium-high profiles with apices in the
anterior one-third of the shell.
C
INTRODUCTION
The limpet shell is a conic, rather than spiral, gastropod
shell. This relative simplicity of design makes it a useful tool
for studying the material properties of shell. Yet despite its
general simplicity there are many different limpet shell
morphologies. The shells range in profile (height to diameter
ratio) from very high to quite low, with apex positions
ranging from nearly central to over the anterior margin,
some even beyond. Nearly all have a variability to some
degree among the shell thicknesses in the apex, at the
margin, and in between. Do these different morphologies
effect the stress distributions and magnitudes in the shells?
Which morphologies are structurally advantageous to the shell
and which are detrimental'
To answer these questions, a series of computerized
limpet models of various morphologies were designed using a
finite element analysis program. These models were then
loaded with several forces and the resultant stress data was
analyzed to determine how the models varied
MATERIALS AND METHOD
The experiment was developed and run using an MSC/PAL
stress and vibration analysis program for the Apple Macintosh
O
C
Plus (MacNeal Schwendler, 1986). This finite element
analysis program is designed to perform stress and vibrational
analysis of mechanical systems and structures. The analyst
provides the following for his/her structure:
the spatial location of the nodal points defining the
structure
the mass and material properties of the structure
the types of connections between the nodes (e.g.
beams or
plates)
any boundary conditions or structural restraints
the static or dynamic load forces
and the type of analysis desired
The program then generates a mathematical model of discrete
nodes and elements from this information and simulates its
physical behavior under the given conditions. It is up to the
analyst to create the descretization (that is, the connectivity
of finite nodes) which will most accurately reflect the
structure's behavior. In general, the more nodal points the
more accurate the model.
The following limpet morphologies were developed for this
experimentation (figure 1)
1. "High profile" — a uniform thickness shell with a
height to diameter ratio of 0.5
2. Low profile" — a uniform thickness shell with a
height to diameter ratio of 0.25
Low apex" — similar to the 'high profile" shell,
but with a somewhat flattened apex
4. "No apex" — similar to the "high profile" shell, but
without the apex, leaving a hole instead
5 „Variable thickness" — similar to the "high profile
shell, but simulating a shell's natural variability in thickness
For each limpet variation a set of six models was
created: one each with apex positions at 50% (distance
foreward from posterior margin), 60%, 709, 80%, 908, and
100%. Quadrilateral and triangular plates connected the
nodes. Each model was given the same material
properties (table 1) and plate properties (table 2) The
following boundary conditions were placed on the models
Translation in the Y direction and rotation about the Y axis
were zeroed for nodes 1 through 16; translation in the XZ
plane was zeroed for the apical node.
The following forces were then applied.
Experiment 1
A force of 106 05 N was applied to each model in a
horseshoe-shaped pattern, as the sum of 15 7.07 N forces
placed from nodes 42 to 56, directed at a 45-degree angle
downward and toward the center of the horseshoe. This
force, calculated by multiplying the tenacity of a limpet out
of water by the pedal area of the limpet model
(approximately the basal area of the shell), was designed to
simulate the muscle force of an undisturbed limpet attaching
itself gently to a rock surface(see Grenon and Walker on
tenacity, 1981) In the case of the variable thickness model,
each component of force was divided in half and applied over
two nodes (from 42 to 56 and 62 to 76) to better simulate
the muscle force.
Experiment 2
In addition to the muscle force of experiment 1, two
external forces were applied to the set of variable thickness
limpets: one to simulate a bird peck on the shell, the second,
to simulate a limpet, such as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lottia gigantea : Exact'>Lottia gigantea,</span> using its shell
to nudge another limpet out of its territory (a bulldozer
effect). The forces were simulated in the following manner
1. The bird peck was a point load of approximately
360 N applied at node 68 with the following components: 300
N in the —Y direction, 120 N in the -X, and 160 N in the
-2.
2. The bulldozer force was a point load of 250 N
applied at node 1 in the tX direction.
The force magnitudes were estimated by multiplying the
tenacity of a limpet attaching itself firmly to a rock by
approximately the basal area of the shell, and then
estimating a value large enough to disturb the limpet while
C
C
not dislodging it from the substrate. This was based on
observations that birds will often crack a limpet's shell
without dislodging the limpet and that in order to bulldoze
the limpet must be attached to the substrate.
Once the models were built and the forces were applied,
the MSC/PAL program simulated the reaction of the model to
the applied force based on the physical properties of the
material and its mechanical structure. The program
generated a static solution for each model, that is, the nodal
displacements and resultant stresses of the model at static
equilibrium with the applied force.
RESULTS
Experiment 1
In all cases the maximum shear stress was much greater
than the maximum tensile stress(figures 2 and 3).
With one exception, the general trend for both shear and
tensile stresses in these various morphologies was toward a
decreasing maximum stress as the apex position was moyed
forward. This was true for each of the high profile limpets
regardless of any variations (such as low or no apex, or
variable thickness). Worth noting is the fact that while the
values for maximum tensile stress in the high profile limpets
C
are all very similar, those for maximum shear stress vary,
most importantly between uniform and variable shell
thickness, with variable thickness having a significantly lower
maximum shear stress.
The exception to this trend is the low profile limpet
which decreases in maximum stress as the apex is moved
forward to 808 in shear, 70% in tension; but maximum
stress then increases as the apex is moyed further forward.
It is important to note that the maximum shear stress of the
low profile limpet is almost always higher than that of the
high profile limpets. At best, the maximum shear stress of
the low profile limpet dips to values about equal to those for
high profile limpets of uniform thickness and low or no apex.
It is always much higher than the values for the 'variable
thickness" limpet. In tensile stress quite the opposite
happens, the maximum values for tensile stress in the low
apex model are lower than those for the high profile models
over quite a wide range of apex positions (from 60% to
almost 90%). Note that tensile stresses are much smaller
than shear stresses.
Experiment 2
For high profile limpets with variable thickness, the
maximum shear and tensile stresses caused by a muscle force
decrease as the apex is moved forward (figure 4)
C
C
The trend of resultant stresses from the external force of
a bird peck is opposite to that for the muscle force(figure 5)
As the apex is moved forward the maximum stresses
increase, decreasing only slightly at the 100% position
The shear stress markedly increases all the way through
the 100% apex position in the case of the bulldozer action,
while the tensile stress increases to about the 80% apex
position and then decreases (figure 6)

DISCUSSION
In his study of 20 California limpet species, David
Lindberg (1981) found that the majority of the species were
clustered into a morphology of medium to medium-high
profile with an apex in the anterior third of the shell(figure
7). Few had apices at either extreme and only one had a
low profile. This data illustrates well the findings of this
experiment; that a higher profile and an apex compromised
between the two extremes reduces the percent of breaking
stress imposed upon the limpet shell. Logically, this reduced
stress would be beneficial to the animal.
Experiment 1 illustrates that there are indeed differences
in stress distribution and magnitude among morphological
types, most notably that high profile models tend to decrease
in stress as their apex moyes forward while stress in low
profile models decreases only partially before increasing once
C

again as the apex moves over the anterior margin.
The high profile models reveal that having either a
lowered apex or no apex at all is a slight advantage in terms
of reducing stress, at least up to the 90% apex position; and
that having variable thickness is, in all cases, a significant
advantage to the shell.
These findings parallel what may be observed in the field;
that the vast majority of limpets are not perfectly conic, but
rather have a reduced slope near the apex. Subtidally,
where there is no threat of desiccation, one will find many
keyhole limpets such as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Fissurella volcano : Exact'>Fissurella volcano</span> which have no
apex at all. Further investigation and observation reveal
that all limpets have variable shell thickness to some degree.
The data from the simulation suggests why. If one looks at
the shear stress diagrams of the 'high profile
limpet (appendix A), one finds that at the 50% apex position
the area of maximum stress is in the apex of the shell. By
comparison one sees that for the "low apex" shell(appendix C)
while the stresses remain approximately equal in other parts
of the shell, they are reduced in the apex region. Therefore
it makes sense that a shell with a lowered apex or no apex
at all, all other factors being equal, would have a reduced
maximum stress. Only occasionally, in such species as
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea mitra : Exact'>Acmaea mitra</span> does one find a shell as high-spired as in these
experiments. As the apex on the 'high profile" shell moyes
10
O
forward this area of maximum stress moves down to the
muscle scar and the advantage of a lowered apex or lack of
apex decreases, eventually becoming a slight disadvantage
when the apex is all the way forward. By increasing their
shell thickness in the areas of maximum stress, the apex and
just below the muscle scar, the variable thickness model
shows that actual limpets have been able to significantly
decrease the percent of breaking stress they experience. This
is due not to a decreased overall stress in those areas (the
force per area is the same), but to an increase in their
breaking strength caused by the increased thickness.
In general, the trend of all types of high profile limpets is
to decrease in maximum stress, tensile or shear, as their
apices move forward. This suggests that it would be to the
advantage of all limpets to have their apices directly over
their anterior margin. Obviously this is not the case. Why?
Experiment 2 reveals that while stresses do indeed decrease
as the apex is moyed forward under a muscle force only,
when an external force such as a bird peck or a bulldozer
action is applied to the shell, the opposite happens, the
stresses increase as the apex is moyed forward. None of
these forces exist in isolation, however. In the field a limpet
experiences a variety of forces which it must be able to
withstand. Therefore a limpet's optimal shell morphology
must be a compromise among the ideal shell morphologies for
C
C
C
each separate force it sees. That is to say, neither directly
in the center of the shell which would be ideal for a bird
peck only, nor completely over the anterior margin, ideal
for the muscle force only, but rather somewhere in between.
This compromise predominates in actual limpets, as seen in
Lindberg's data
The low profile limpet, however, is much more
complicated. There is no clear trend toward an increased or
decreased maximum stress, in either shear or tension, as the
apex is moved forward. The stresses begin to decrease, only
to sharply increse half-way forward. The low profile model
demonstrates a great disparity between the advantages it
holds in terms of tensile stress and its disadvantages in terms
of shear stress. In terms of tensile stress, a low profile
would be preferable to a high profile. From apex positios of
60% to nearly 90% the low profile limpet has a much lower
tensile stress than the high profile limpets. Looking at shear
stress, however, the low profile limpet has a much higher
maximum stress over all but a very small range of apex
positions. It is almost always a distinct disadvantage to the
limpet. What one must remember to resolve this disparity
is the relative scale of the two stresses. The shear stresses
are significantly higher than the tensile stresses along the
entire range of apex positions. So it is the shear stress
which is the predominent stress and that which should be
C
C
analyzed to determine any advantages that a low profile
might hold as an alternative morphology. Thus a low profile
should generally be considered an undesirable morphology
It should be noted, however, that in some species
specially adapted morphologies exist. Lottia gigantea, for
example, is a low profiled limpet with its apex nearly 1008
forward. Considering that the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lottia : Exact'>Lottia</span> is known to protect its
territory by bulldozing other limpets out, it appears to
contradict almost all of the above findings. The hidden
resolution to this contradiction is in Lottia's exaggerated
anterior thickness. A territorial limpet, the Lottia clears the
space around itself by nudging other limpets out with the
anterior surface of its shell, This experiment suggests why,
through the course of evolution, natural selection would favor
Lottia with increased anterior thicknesses.
CONCLUSION
These experiments illustrate that various morphologies do
alter the stress distributions and magnitudes in limpet shells
and that some select morphologies have more desirable
characteristics than others. High profiles, lowered apices,
variable shell thicknesses, and apices balanced between
extremes were all shown to reduce stress. These findings
corrolate well with actual limpet morphologies as observed by
13
Lindberg.
