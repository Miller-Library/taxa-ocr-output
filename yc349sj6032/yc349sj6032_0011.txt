Graph I: This graph shows the correlation between
light and Chlorophyll A. As light intensity increases,
the amount of Chlorophyll A increases.
Graph II: Each point represents a separate snemone sam-
ple of tentacles. As depth increases, the amount of Chloro-
phyll A decreases. This function is significant with a
99.9% probability.
Graph III: This shows the decrease in amount of light
as depth increases.
Graph IV: Here the amount of light was recorded where
each tentacle sample was taken. This shows the correlation
between Chlorophyll A and light intensity despite fluctations
with depth.
