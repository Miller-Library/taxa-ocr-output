Materials and Methods
To approach this problem some preliminary field obser-
vations were first made. After noticing that A. elegantissima
could be found as deep as -35 feet, anemones were sampled
at different depths in both the intertidal and subtidal zones.
Three A. elegantissima and three A. xanthogrammica were col-
lected at different depths. Each of these was tested re-
peatedly, serving as a control, in order to establish the
amount of variance in the pigment analysis procedure.
To get many different samples, three to five anemone
tentacles were snipped off with scissors underwater and placed
in a glass vial. Depth and unusual light conditions that
existed were recorded.
After collecting tentacle samples from depths of plus 3
to -37 feet, the amount of Chlorophyll A pergram of tentacle
(wet weight) was measured. The amount of Chlorophyll A was
assumed to be a function of the amount of zooxanthellae present.
Tentacle samples were blotted dry on a paper towel to
eliminate excess water, then weighed. Next water was added
to make a.5 ml equivalent of water and 4.5 mls of scetone
were added. This solution was homogenized and centrifuged
for 10 minutes. The optical density of the extract was
measured at three different wavelengths against an acetone
water blank in a Beckman Spectrophotometer Model 200. The
amount of ChlorophyllA present was determined by the equation
5( 15.6 (0D 665) - 2(0D 445) - 8(0D 630)) and was divided by
the weight of the sample to give mg of Chlorophyll A per
