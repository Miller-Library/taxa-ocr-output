appears to affect the amount of zooxanthellae.
There is a considerable amount of variance in number of
zooxanthellae from anemone to anemone at a given depth due
to the changing light conditions subtidally (kelp cover and
orientation on or under rocks affect this greatly.)
Observations also show that light is not the factor lim-
iting the distribution of Anthopleura since without symbionts
they are found in dark areas such as under the cannery.
However, specific other factors controlling their occurrance
beyond 10 feet depth where they are scarce are not known.
In summary, the amount of Chlorophyll A decreases as
light decreases; this is apparent in the larger amount of
ChlorophyllA in the intertidal anemones. Light also decreases
as depth increases which tends to establish a vertical
gradient. Many factors influence the amount of light the
anemones receive such as their orientation, covering of over-
hanging rocks, their position on wharf pilings, the kelp
bed, and their depth. It would also be interesting to see
how the amount of photosynthetic products available to the
anemone changes as a function of light and depth and if a
change would affect the distribution of anemones.
