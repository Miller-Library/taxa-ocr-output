ABSTRACT
Using the amount of Chlorophyll A as an indicator of
numbers of zooxanthellse (Dinoflagellata) present per gram
tentacle of Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica,
it was found that the amount decreased with subtidal depth.
The scarcity of Anthopleura below 10 feet depth appears not
to be dependent on the availability of light, but on other
unknown factors.
