Introduction
Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt 1835) and Anthopleura
xanthogrammica (Brandt 1835) are common sea anemones in the
intertidal and subtidal zones of the Monterey Peninsula.
Often these animals contain Dinoflagellates known as zooxan-
thellae living symbiotically in the gastrodermal tissue.
(Muscatine, 1961) These are unicellular brown or yellow-
brown algae and provide photosynthetic products to the host
anemone. (Muscatine and Hand, 1958)
I was interested in seeing whether the anemones Antho-
pleura xanthogrammica and A. elegantissima had differing
amounts of symbionts in the intertidal and subtidal zones.
I wanted to see whether there was a relationship between an
increase in depth subtidally to 30 to 710 feet and the
number of zooxanthellae in the anemones.
