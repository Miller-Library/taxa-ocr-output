gram of tentacle.
The amount of light was measured using an underwater
Gold Crest photographic light meter. Light readings were
taken on four different dives at many different depths by
recording incident light. The light meter was calibrated
using a Photovolt Universal Photometer Model 200 to obtain
light values in foot candles.
Results
Data from experiments and field observations indicate
that the amount of Chlorophyll A present was a function of
light. This also correlated with depth since the light
intensity decreased as depth increased.
Figure 1 shows that as incident light available to the
anemone increases, the amount of Chlorophyll A per gram of
tentacle increases also. In very dark areas, almost no
zooxanthellae occurs in the tissue and in bright sunlight,
such as in the intertidal, the most numbers of zooxanthellae
are present.
Figure 2 shows a decrease in amount of Chlorophyll A
per gram tentacle as depth increases. The deepest anemones
sampled, usually A. elegantissima, have the least amount of
Chlorophyll A and also the least numbers of zooxanthellae.
Figure 3 shows a decrease in incident light as depth
increases. There can be also a lot of variability in light
