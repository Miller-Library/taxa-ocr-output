Discussion
The specific location of A. xanthogrammica and A. ele-
gantissima in the intertidal and subtidal zones influences
greatly the amount of zooxanthellse living in them (Muscatine,
1971). From the data, it appears that light determines the
amount of zooxanthellae and also decreases with depth. At
varying light conditions at a constant depth, the amount of
Chlorophyll A per gram of tentacle varies and if light is
constant and depth varies, the amount of Chlorophyll A is
constant also.
Some observations that support this are: 1) The deeper
anemones are found, the paler they are. Also, an anemone
slightly covered by an overhanging rock at -30 feet will be
much paler than an anemone covered by a similar overhanging
rock at-10 feet.
2) The anemones under the cannery are either white or
very pale with almost no zooxanthellae in them. (The cannery
blocks out most of the light.)
3) On the wharf pilings there is a gradation in amount
of pigment on individual pilings. The A. elegantissima and
A. xanthogrammica on the bright side of the pilings show
three times more zooxanthellae than those on the shady sides
of the pilings. These anemones can be of the same clone but
will vary greatly in the amount of pigment.
1) Under the kelp bed the anemones are paler than anem-
ones elsewhere. The kelp canopy cuts some light out which
