Trophic Magnification:
Much attention has been given to the problems of biological
magnification of DDT, DDE, PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls),
and other halogenated hydrocarbon concentrations (WOCDWELL,
1967; JOHNSON, et al, 1971; NIMTO, et al, 1971). Upon analy-
sis of Table 1, it seems evident that heavy metals do not con-
centrate through the trophic levels of the organisms studied.
SUMMARY
Although concentrations of heavy and trace metals are not
magnified through the studied trophic levels, this possiblity
may still exist. This is suggested from the high elemental levels
observed at Fisherman's Wharf (Cu and Pb), Monterey Sewage
Outfall (Ag, Cd, and Zn), and Elkhorn Slough (Fe). These
high values, possible consequences of pollution, should not
go unchecked. Much study is still needed as to toxicity, base
levels, and the possible biological magnification of heavy
and trace metals.
