Nickel:
Olivella bodies had highest concentrations at Fisherman's
Wharf (1.8 + 1.7 ppm), and Polinices was highest (1.9 + 1.5 ppm)
at Elkhorn Slough. These values compare with 4 ppm for Mollusca
(VINOGRADOV, 1953). Olivella shells were much higher than the
soft parts (16.9 + 2.9 ppm), and the same is true for Polinices
shells (16.2 + 8.4 ppm). Pisaster rays were found to have
higher concentrations than other tissues, however, these high
values may be due to light scattering caused by the large amounts
of calcium in the samples. Nickel affects several enzymes in
vitro- activation of arginase, carboxylase, trypsin, citritase,
and inhibition of acid phospotase- but is not necessary for
proper functioning.
Silver:
VINOGRADOV (1953) stated Mollusca levels as O ppm, and Echin-
odermata levels as 3? ppm. Since sea-water contains only 3x

10-44g/1 (GOLLBERG, 1963), these relative low levels are quite
high enrichment factors. Olivella bodies were found to be much
higher at Monterey Outfall than any other area (10.7 + 4.8 ppm).
The rays of Pisaster contained equal concentrations and were
higher than any other tissue. This high value in the rays may
be due to scatter. VEITH (1971) reported effluent levels of
many metals from the Monterey Sewage Cutfall, silver having a
concentration in the effluent of 25 ppm. This high input directly
into the biosphere could possibly explain the high Olivella values.
ffinity for
Silver, an electronegative metal, has a strong
imino, amino, and sulphydryl groups (ECWEN, 1966). These groups
