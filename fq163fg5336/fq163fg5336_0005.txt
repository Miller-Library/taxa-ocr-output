1963), yet much lower than copper levels observed in experimental
animals. Fisherman's Wharf had the highest values of copper:
Olivella - 177.3 + 16.5 ppm; Polinices - 115.4 + 11.3 ppm.
GRAILIM (1972) and FITZ (1971) found copper concentrations at
Fisherman's Wharf in Tegula funebralis and Emerita analoga
(STIMPSON, 1857) to be 175 + 9.C ppm and 71 - 90 ppm, respectively.
Pisaster had higher copper levels at Fisherman's Wharf than at
the Monterey Sewage Outfall. It is not known why these levels
are highest at the Wharf. Perhaps high copper values are re¬
lated to pollution from boats.
Copper, a highly electronegative metal, is classified as
a metallo-enzyme (BOWEN, 1966). This high electronegative quality
may act to destroy or deactivate enzymes. ADELSTEIN AND VALLEE
(1962) and UNDERWCOD (1971) cited that haemocyanin, an important
copper containing respiratory pigment in various gastropods
and other marine species, was a constituent in blood plasma.
On this basis one would expect to find this element concentrated
in gastropod soft parts.
Iron:
Olivella had the lowest iron levels (358 + 47 ppm) at the
Monterey Sewage Outfall, while Polinices levels remained equal
at both localities. These values, although lowest, are still
above the 200 ppm level for Mollusca and 300 ppm level for

Echinodermata specified by VINOGRADOV (1953). CULLIN AND RILEI
