INTRODUCTTON
The determination of metal concentrations in marine organ-
isms is becoming increasingly nécessary for ecological study
due to interactions of essential trace metals with toxic heavy
metals. The significance of trace metals in the marine biosphere
was documented many years ago (CORNEC, 1919; CLAPKE ARD WHEELER,
1922), and research in this field has flourished with the improv-
ment of analytical methods. Reviews by VINCGRALOV (1953) and
COLDBERG (1967) demonstrate increasing importance of heavy metals
in the marine environment.
The accelerated research in heavy metal analysis has led
to greater knowledge of the elemental levels in several marine
organisms (PROOKS AND RUNSBY, 1965; CULKIN AND RILEY, 1958;
—
BERTINE AND GOLDBERG, 1971; GRAHAN, 1972). However, the marine
environment being extremely complex, diverse, and in constant
flux, comparatively few organisms have been analyzed for their
elemental content.
The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the levels
of Ag, Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, and
Zn in the herbivorous gastropod Olivella biplicata (SOWERBY,
1925), the predatory gastropod Polinices lewisii (GOULD, 1847),
and the predatory starfish Pisaster brevispinus (STIMPSON, 1857)

(these latter two species prey upon Olivella (see EDMARDS, 1969));
2) to clarify the relationship of metals between the two trophic
levels; 3) to define the range and variability of metal con-
centrations within the same species with respect to geographic
location, and 4) to determine the difference in elemental con¬
centrations between certain tissues.
