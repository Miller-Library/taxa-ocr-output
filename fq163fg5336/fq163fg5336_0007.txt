respectively). These high values for the shells and Pisaster
rays may be due to light scatter.
BOWEN (1966) classified lead as a very high potential
pollutant. Lead occurs chiefly as a contaminant, and can pro¬
duce toxic effects by combining with cellular membranes to altei
permeability (PASSOW, 1969). Cadmium and copper may also pro-
duce toxic effects by acting on membrane permeability (PASSON,
1969). Lead contamination is very high (0.07 - 0.35Ag Pb/ng
sea-water) in the marine environment (PATTEPSON, 1971). Soil
contains 10 ppm (BOWEN, 1966), and stated levels for Mollusca
and Echinodermata are 0.7 ppm and 187 ppm, respectively (VILO-
GRADOV, 1953). The highest input of lead into the biosphere
is mostly due to automobile exhaust emission.
kanganese:
Manganese has been reported at 60 ppm in Echinodermata and
10 ppm in Mollusca (VINCGRADOV, 1953). Polinices was found to
have the highest concentration of Mn at Elkhorn Slough (27.5 +
5.5 ppm), while levels in Olivella soft parts remained consistant,
as did levels in rays of Pisaster. Manganese levels in Pisaster
soft parts were very low (non-detectable —- 3.0 + 1.4 ppm).
Manganese is another element that is essential for life.
It is considered a metal-activated enzyme (VALLEE, 1955), and was
found to activate certain phosphate transferases and decarboxyl-
ases (BOWEN, 1966). Organically bound Mn is found in Mollusca

(VINCUMADEV, 1953), one of these proteins being pinnaglobin
(ECERI, 1963).
