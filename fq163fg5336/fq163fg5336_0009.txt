are most likely reactive sites on many enzymes, and hence silver
has the capacity to deactivate the enzyme. It follows that
silver is therefore a poison, by virtue of its reactivity with
proteins, especially enzymes. Silver competes with copper,
but probably does not inhibit the copper enzyme (CHRISTIAN ARD
FELDMIN, 1970).
Zinc:
Polinices soft parts had highest concentrations at Elkhorn
Slough (288 + 18 ppm) and Olivella bodies were highest at
Fisherman's Wharf (127 + 14 ppm). GRAHAM (1972) found zinc
levels in Tegula funebralis to be 198 + 7 ppm. These values
all correspond with those in VINCGRADOV (1953) of 200 ppm for
Mollusca and 25 ppm for Echinodermata. Pisaster displays an
interesting pattern as to zinc concentration. The Wharf site
was higher in all tissues except for the gonads. At the Outfall,
the gonads were excessively high, with values averaging 511.9
+ 28.1 ppm. Echinoderm gonads are known to contain high zinc
levels (personal correspondence, MARTIN). Those Pisaster collected
at the Outfall had less developed gonads than those from Fisher-
man's Wharf. This may be the reason why specimens from these
two localities differed in Zn concentrations. Another possibility
could be the high zinc effluent from the Monterey Outfall of
820 ppm (YEITH, 1971).
Zinc, a metallo-enzyme, is essential to most life forms
(EOWEN, 1966). Zinc can displace copper from a protein, and
hence act as an antagonist, or can compete in some proteins with
