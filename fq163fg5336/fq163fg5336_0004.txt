Aluminum:
Polinices had highest levels at Fisherman's Wharf (50.6 +
7.5 ppm) and Olivella had highest values at Elkhorn Slough
(Os.5 + 12.3 ppm) and lowest at Monterey Outfall (59.6 + 19.2
ppm). These values are similar to the 50 ppm level described
by VINCGRADOV (1953). The high values of Olivella at Elkhorn
Slough are probably due to the greater amount of clay particles
in suspension in this area.
Cadmium:
Y (1956) found cadmium levels in Mollusca
EULLIN AND RILE
of 3 ppm, and levels in Echinodermata of 1 ppm. Results indiÂ¬
cate that these levels are consistent with Olivella (2.3 + 1.9
ppm -- 4.2 + 5.1 ppm) and Polinices (0.3 + 0.5 ppm -- 1.6 f
1.3 ppm). GRAHAM (1972) found cadmium levels in the gastropod
Tegula funebralis (ADANS, 1854) at Fisherman's Wharf of 2.2
ppm. Pisaster hepatic caecum was found to have high Cd levels
(46.3 + 20.6 ppm) at the Monterey Outfall.
Cadmium is a known contaminant (NILSSON, 1970). Besides
being a general cytotoxic agent, cadmium competes with zinc and
copper for the same binding sites. Zinc and cadmium occur
synergistically in nature; these two elements are likely iso-
morphic in metallothionein (PASSOW, 1969).
Copper:
Levels of 4 ppm to 50 ppm (VINCGRADCV, 1953) are much
higher than copper levels in sea-water, 3 x 10-3 g/1 (GOLDBERG,
