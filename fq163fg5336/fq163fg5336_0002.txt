METHOD.
â€”
Olivella, Polinices, and Pisaster were collected subtidally
on sandy beaches (Figure 1) and placed in plastic bags. In the
laboratory, the animals were placed in filtered sea-water
aquaria and allowed to purge themselves of sediments for a
minimum of twenty-four hours. The gastropods were boiled in
distilled water for three to five minutes. This procedure
allowed the soft parts to be easily separated from the shells
with a plastic fork or stainless steel forceps. Both the shell
and soft tissue were oven dried at 65 degrees Centigrade for a
minimum of forty-eight hours.
he starfish were dissected with stainless steel scissors
immediately after purging in sea-water. Part of one ray (not
including hepatic caecum or gonads), hepatic caecum, gonadal
tissue, and a combination of the pyloric stomach, cardiac stomach
and rectal caeca were dissected, placed in tared beakers, and
oven dried.
When dry, the soft parts were ground to a fine powder with
morter and pestle. The Pisaster ray homogenate contained
particles of about 0.5 centimeters across or smaller. The
gastropod shells were not ground. The Polinices shells were
separated into four parts: operculum, anterior, posterior,
and spire. The Olivella shells were digested whole.
Aliquots were weighed into tared beakers and digested with
70% or 90% nitric acid. Shells were digested with concentrated
hydrochloric acid. The samples were left at room temperature
