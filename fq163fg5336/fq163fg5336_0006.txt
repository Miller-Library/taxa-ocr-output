229 ppm, respectively.
Gastropod shells were found to be highest in iron at the
Fisherman's Wharf site. Olivella shells had mean values of 74.6
C.2 ppm, while anterior parts of the Polinices shell had a
value of 81.1 + 22.4 ppm. Pisaster data suggested that the soft
parts were concentrating more iron at the Outfall, while the
ray was higher at Fisherman's Wharf. Iron is found in high
concentrations in clay, and so the high values may be natural
levels. The high values at Fisherman's Wharf could, however,
be attributed to the iron structures located there.
Iron, like many other elements, is essential for life.
As a metal-activated enzyme, iron is able to activate many oxiÂ¬
dases involving molecular oxygen. However, iron is more common-
ly considered a metallo-enzyme, because it is more firmly bound
to a protein in constant stoichiometric ratios rather than
loosely held. One such metalloprotein, echinochrome, is found
in Echinoderm blood (CANNAN, 1927).
Lead:
Levels of lead were found to be greatest for Olivella at
Fisherman's Wharf (8.2 + 3.6 ppm) and Polinices (5.0 + 2.4 ppm)
soft parts. GRAHAM (1972) found the gastropod Thais emarginata

(DESHAYES, 1839) to have levels of 9.8 + 4.0 ppm in lead at
Fisherman's Wharf. Olivella shells were lowest at the Wharf,
with highest values at Elkhorn Slough. Polinices shells also had
highest concentrations at Elkhorn Slough. Pisaster tended to
concentrate lead in the rays, Fisherman's Wharf being higher
than Monterey Outfall (30.9 + 4.3 ppm and 15.9 + 4.2 ppm,
