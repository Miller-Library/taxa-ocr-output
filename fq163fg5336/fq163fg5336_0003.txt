for one hour, refluxed for one hour, and evaporated to 5 ml.
Two to three milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide added dropÂ¬
wise oxidized any remaining organic matter. One milliliter of
hydrochloric acid was added and'the samples were adjusted to
a final dilution (1%) with distilled water.
The samples were analyzed by atomic absorption. Reagent
blanks were run with each group of samples. Readings of less
than 2% absorption were discarded due to probable background
effects.
Means and 95% confidence intervals were determined using
the expression t VX/N, where Vx/N is the standard error of
the mean for NX30, and t is the Student's t value for N-1
degrees of freedom (ELLIOTT, 1971).


LESULPS AND DISCUSSION
Means and 95% confidence intervals for Olivella, Polinices,
and Pisaster soft and hard parts are listed in Table 1. Con-
centrations of aluminum, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese,
nickel, silver, and zinc for Olivella and Polinices soft parts,
and selected Pisaster tissues from different localities are
presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The results
are discussed individually for each element with respect to
geographical location, trophic level, and physiological parts.
Ba, Ca, k, Mg, Na, and Sr values are not discussed but are listed
in Table 1. All elemental values are expressed as Ag/g (ppm)
and ppm is used throughout the text.
