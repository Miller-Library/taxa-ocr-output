the different leg receptors, and determine which are recruited to respond at each applied
frequency
It was interesting to note that none of the data analysis techniques pursued in this
experiment demonstrated sensor responsiveness to vibration frequencies above 500 Hz. The
normalized frequency response analysis actually indicated a significant decrease in nerve firing
rate in response to the 1000 Hz stimulus level (Fig. 7). While this prevents a confident claim of
responsiveness at greater frequencies, it seems premature to conclude that they do not lie within
receptor sensitivity range. Related arthropods, such as the fiddler crab and the cricket (Aicher
and Tautz 1983; Dusenbery 1992), have been demonstrated to respond to stimuli intensity up to
2 kHz. The decrease in firing observed in the Pachygrapsis leg nerve at these higher rates,
therefore, may in fact be a form of sensory encoding through different neuronal response
patterns. Aicher and Tautz found that the spontaneous activity of one of the fiddler crab leg
nerve units was increasingly suppressed by the application of higher frequency stimuli. This
inhibition was postulated to help in discrimination between low frequency communicational
signals and high frequency background noise. Although vibrational communication is not an
obvious behavioral characteristic of Pachygrapsis, inhibition could still play a role in signal
discrimination in their natural habitat. Inhibition of this kind could easily account for the
decrease in normalized response seen with the application of high frequency stimuli.
Determining whether inhibition is a method of response would potentially allow more complete
characterization of the vibration sensitivity range of the crab. Doing so, however, would require
recording from individual neuronal fibers within the leg nerve to determine their distinct
response characteristics which was beyond the scope of this particular experiment.
