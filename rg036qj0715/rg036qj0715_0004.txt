substrate with their enlarged chelae (Salmon 1971). These studies thoroughly quantify the
vibrational sensitivity and response patterns of these crabs' leg sensors, as well as those of their
vibration responsive CNS interneurons (Hall 1985, Aicher and Tautz 1983, Aicher and Tautz
1990, Salmon 1971). Similar studies have been performed to quantify the vibrational sensitivity
of cercal hairs in the cricket and cockroach (Buno et al. 1981, Dagan and Camhi 1979,
Matsumoto and Murphey 1977, Buno et al. 1981) All of this work demonstrates that vibrational
sensitivity is an extremely important element of the arthropod sensory system, playing a diverse
and substantial role in their interactions with the environment.
Although vibrational sensitivity makes up an important part of the sensory world, or
Umwelt, of Pachygrapsis, little is known about the range of vibrational stimuli to which they
respond. The goal of this study, therefore, was to begin to quantify this range in order to
understand what these crabs "hear" in their noisy vibrational environment. Defining this window
of sensitivity is the first step in understanding the possible effects of anthropogenic vibrations
introduced into the crabâ€™s environment by human near-shore activity. If these vibrations lie
within the sensitivity range of Pachygrapsis, they could be "jamming" the sensitivity channel of
the crab and therefore substantially reducing its fitness, and ability to relate to its environment.
Materials and methods
Subjects:
Pachygrapsis crassipes of indiscriminant size, gender and age were collected by hand
from the intertidal area of Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. Animals were kept up to three days in a
tank which was continuously refreshed by unfiltered seawater.
