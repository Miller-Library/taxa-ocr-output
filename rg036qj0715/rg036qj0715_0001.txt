Abstract
Pachygrapsis crassipes, the lined purple shore crab, is equipped with extremely sensitive
sensory hairs on its walking legs. These hairs potentially play a major role in mediating the
crab’s sensory relationship with its environment, including encoding vital information such as
the approach of predators. This study examined the vibratory sensitivity of these tactile sensors
in order to quantify the frequency range to which they respond, as well as their absolute level of
sensitivity. Electrophysiological methods were used to determine the sensors' threshold to
impulse-like stimuli. Neuronal responses were then tested over a wide range of frequencies and
intensities to more completely quantify the sensitivity range.
Introduction
In the middle of the 20" century, pioneer German ethologist Baron Jacob
Von Uexkull introduced the idea that all animals live within unique, species-specific perceptual
worlds which he entitled their “Umwelt". A species' Umwelt defines its environment in relation
to its sensory capabilities. Information outside of these capabilities is imperceptible and,
therefore, effectively does not exist. In the 1934 essay entitled "A Stroll through the Worlds of
Animals and Men: A picture book of invisible worlds", Uexkull described the Umwelt as being
“like soap-bubble surrounding an individual being, filtering all it sees and feels." In less ethereal
terms, the Umwelt represents the result of a long-period of evolutionary adaptation to a particular
environment, which has led to the ability to detect and filter sensory cues essential to survival,
and ignore uninformative sensory "noise". To this effect, the Umwelt's of different species have
different richness, often corresponding to the complexity of their behavior. A classic example of
