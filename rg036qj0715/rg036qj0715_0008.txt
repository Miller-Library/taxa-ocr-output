While testing the response of the leg receptors to various frequencies of vibrational
stimuli, it was interesting to see changes in the nervous response pattern with the application of
different frequency ranges. Lower frequency stimuli of 10-50 Hz elicited obvious phase-locking
in the receptor output, but vibrations above 50 Hz did not. This may simply be due to constraints
in the speed of successive action potentials resulting from intrinsic properties of the individual
neurons. It may also, however, indicate that different neurons, with different output
characteristics, are responding at the different frequencies. Due to limitations in the
experimental methods, it was not possible to differentiate and record from single vibrationÂ¬
sensitive neurons within the leg nerve. Aicher and Tautz (1983), in experiments on the leg nerve
of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator were able to identify two types of neurons in the walking-leg
nerve which responded differently to sinusoidal mechanical stimuli. One of these neuron types
was excited only in the frequency range of 2-100 Hz. While no assumptions are made here as to
morphological similarities between these two crab species, this indicates the possibility that
individual nerve fibers respond differently to the application of distinct stimulus frequency
ranges.
It is also possible that the different response patterns result from the activation of
different vibration-sensitive receptors in the leg. The crab dactyl is covered with sensory hairs of
different size, position and morphology (Fig 2), which may be differentially recruited to encode
stimuli within specific frequency ranges. It is likely that different receptor populations synapse
with different neuronal populations in order to allow signal discrimination. Differential
stimulation of receptors, therefore, would activate different groups of neurons with distinct
response patterns. To determine whether this is the case, it would be necessary to characterize
