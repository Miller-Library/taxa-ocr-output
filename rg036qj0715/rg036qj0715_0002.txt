an “impoverished" Umwelt is that of a tick, which is sensitive to only three specific sensory cues
allowing it to detect its mammalian host. This can be strikingly contrasted with the Umwelt of a
human, which includes sensitivity to broad color spectra and sound frequency, and highly-
developed olfactory and tactile capabilities. This contrast accentuates one of the greatest benefits
attained from Uexkull's idea: freedom from the belief that all animals perceive the world in the
same manner as humans. This means to truly understand an animal, humans must first
understand its sensory capabilities, and the sensory cues which shape and define its Umwelt.
Pursuit of this understanding is the goal of the newly emerging scientific field, Sensory
Ecology, the integration of sensory physiology and ecology. In a world filled with an incredible
amount of information, sensory ecologists seek to quantify what information is filtered out by an
animal, and in what way, in order to mediate its interaction with its environment. What
information has the animal evolved to define the boundaries of its Umwelt, and how does this
information help it be maximally fit?
The recognition of restricted windows of sensory sensitivity in animals has drawn
attention to a potential new source of human-induced environmental harm. Human activities
often introduce a large amount of sensory "noise" into the surrounding environment. One of the
most widely recognized types of this sensory pollution is auditory or vibratory noise, which is
commonly associated with activities such as construction and transportation. Sound sensitivity
varies widely among animals (Fig. 1) and is used in many different ways, often playing a vital
role in communication and predator-prey interactions. Human-produced sound that falls withir
the frequency range of these environmental cues could confuse or limit an animal’s ability to
perceive important sound signals, and therefore reduce its fitness.
