Varied frequency.
To test receptor response to a variety of different frequencies, a speaker cone was
fastened to the side of a plastic stand supporting the prepared leg. A function generator fed
sinusoidal frequency functions of 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 Hz to a stereo amplifier which
drove the speaker cone via a power amplifier. Frequencies were applied in random order at two
different amplitudes, and approximately every third recording was made without applied
stimulus to control for receptor fatigue. Each trial lasted 500 ms and was recorded as a single
file by the computer to allow later comparison.
Results
Threshold determination:
Leg response to stimulus application was scored according to a binary scheme. A score
of 1 indicated a positive receptor response to applied stimulus, and 0 indicated none (Fig 3).
Threshold sensitivity of the leg was stochastic, lying within the range of 1.4 * 10°-3.9 * 10° N-
m. Within this range response to stimulus application was variable. Above the range responses
were consistently 1 and below they were consistently 0 (Fig 4).
Varied frequency.
Lower frequency stimuli (10-50 Hz) elicited a phase-locked response in the leg's output
train, demonstrated by autocorrelation analysis. Significant correlation in the output signal
occurred at intervals corresponding to single cycles of the sinusoidal stimuli. This indicated that
the leg was firing a patterned response locked to the frequency of the stimulus (Fig. 5). At
frequencies above 50 Hz phase-locking was no longer observed (Fig. 6).
