Stimulus frequencies from 50-200 Hz elicited an increase in temporal firing rate in the
leg nerve. This was measured by counting the number of action potentials surpassing a certain
threshold level set by eye directly above background recording noise. Data were normalized to
account for small changes in firing rate as the leg fatigued. Normalization was performed by
dividing the counts during the test run by the average of the counts from control recordings taken
directly before and after. A normalized value greater than 1 indicates an increased firing in
response to applied stimuli. All normalized values resulting from the application of a particular
stimulus frequency and amplitude were averaged to quantify the general response to stimulus of
that intensity. The higher amplitude stimuli consistently elicited a greater temporal firing rate
than the lower, although the difference is nearly indistinguishable at a frequency of 1000Hz (Fig.
7). Neither data analysis technique was able to demonstrate sensitivity to vibrational stimuli
with frequency greater than 500 Hz.
Discussion
The threshold determination phase of the experiment proved the crabs' vibrational
sensors to be extremely responsive to high-frequency impulse stimuli. Many important
environmental signals in the crabs' natural habitat, such as the pecking of predatory birds,
produce impulse vibrations similar to the artificial stimulus applied (Thompson, personal
communication). The crabs' high degree of sensitivity, therefore, is unsurprising. Putting this
result into an applicable environmental context would require measuring the scaling factor
between signal propagation in the steel table and in the rocky substrate of the intertidal. This
would allow direct quantification of crab sensitivity to impulse stimuli in their natural
environment in terms of distance from the stimulus source.
