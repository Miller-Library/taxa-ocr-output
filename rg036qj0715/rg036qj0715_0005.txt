Leg preparation:
All experiments were performed on isolated walking legs of the experimental subjects.
The legs were pinned in a small dish of seawater and the leg nerve exposed. Extracellular
recordings from the nerve were taken with a hook electrode connected to a recording amplifier
(Grass Instruments). The amplifier fed to an oscilliscope used to visualize nervous output, as
well as a computer data acquisition system using the software program P-Clamp 8.
Scanning Electron Microscope:
Samples were air dried, mounted on carbon tape and sputter coated with gold, then
viewed with a Hitachi S-450 scanning electron microscope at 15 kv.
Threshold determination:
High-frequency, impulse-like stimuli were produced by dropping differently sized steel
ball bearings from various heights onto a steel table upon which the leg was mounted. The ball
was dropped from an angled slide attached to a metal stand to ensure that it fell from the desired
height. A strain gauge fastened to the table under the slide recorded the exact moment of
stimulus application. A custom-built amplifier fed the signal from the gauge into the computer.
This data was aligned with the corresponding output from the leg to allow direct comparison
between stimulus application and nervous response. Stimulus intensity was measured in
Newton-meters (N-m), the gravitational potential energy imparted to the table by ball impact.
