Conclusions:
This experiment made substantial strides in characterizing the frequency sensitivity range
of the lined purple shore crab. Threshold sensitivity to high-frequency stimuli was determined,
and responsiveness was demonstrated within a vibrational stimulus range of 10-500 Hz. The
next critical step in a sensory ecology based analysis, is to move into the field and determine the
vibrational stimuli naturally present in the animalâ€™s informational channel. This would allow a
clearer characterization of the role played by vibrational signals in ensuring the species' fitness.
It would also allow a calculation of anthropogenic noise sources that could interfere with this
sensitivity window and therefore disrupt the species' ability to relate maximally to its
environment.
