INTRODUCTION
There are many studies on the symbiotic relationship
between sea anemones and fish (Lubbock, 1980) (Schlicter, 1976)
(Mariscal, 1966) (Davenport and Norris, 1958), anemones and
shrimp (Dales, 1966), and anemones and hermit crabs (Hand,
1975) (Ross, 1974). Closely related to these is the curious
behavior of the hermit crabs Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857)
and Pagurus granosimanis (Stimpson, 1859) in association with
the sea anemones Anthopleura xanthogrammica (Brandt, 1835)
and Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835). In the inter-
tidal of Hopkins Marine Station, Pagurus were observed crawling
on the columns, tentacles, and oral discs of the anemones with
apparent immunity to their nematocysts. This behavior differs
considerably from the hermit crab-anemone association studied
by Ross (1974) where the anemone is carried attached to the
shell of the hermit crab.
These studies were carried out to investigate the nature
of the symbiosis chiefly through observing and recording the
crabs' behavior during the acclimation process, looking for
possible advantages in the relationship and studying the
behavior and cooccurrence of the involved species in the field.
My studies indicate the hermit crabs acclimate to anemones,
perhaps by picking up a coating of anemone mucus. The pagurids
may freely crawl over the anemones and take food from the
tentacles or even from the gut cavity. The findings presented
here indicate a somewhat labile symbiosis between these interÂ¬
tidal hermit crabs and anemones.
