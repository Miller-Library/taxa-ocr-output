changes of behavior in lab whereas those taken from separate
tidepools exhibited fighting for five days. The crabs from both
tidepools were equally as active at night as during the day.
Association
For a study on the duration of the relation between hermit
crabs and anemones, in the field eight tidepools were used,
four with anemones and four without. As much care as possible
was taken to select tidepools which were similar in exposure,
height, and location. In each tidepool shells of crabs were
marked with red fingernail polish. For a week, records were
kept as to the number of marked crabs remaining in each tidepool.
Distribution and Density
To determine the distribution and cooccurrence of crabs
and anemones in the study area, six transects, 10m x 5m, were
established as marked on the map of figure 2. Anemones in
the b to 11 cm size range were counted in these transects and
hermit crabs were sampled by haphazardly placing .25m
quadrats along each transect. This was done for both regions
sampled.
Acclimation
To quantify the shell acclimation of the hermit crabs, I
measured the force of adhesion of the tentacles to acclimated
and non-acclimated shells using a portable torsion balance
that measured up to 24 gms. Tegula were attached by nylon
thread and slowly lowered onto the tentacles of A. xanthogrammica
