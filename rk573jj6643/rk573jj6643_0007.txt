They often sat in one spot and moved their shell back and forth
through the tentacles. On other occasions crabs would walk
back and forth brushing the tentacles. The tentacles often
retracted but did not appear to stick to the shell. They
displayed this behavior between 5 and 20 minutes.
When the brushing was discontinued, the crabs began sweeping
and stroking the tentacles with their antennae. The sweeping
motion extended along the entire length of the tentacles. An
occasional stroke of the antennae would be across the bodies
of the crabs. This behavior continued for 5 to 25 minutes,
The crabs were then observed freely walking among the tentacles,
Not all of the crabs which engaged in some of the steps
engaged in them all. However, those that actually walked on
the tentacles and therefore were considered completely acclimated
did display each step sequentially. Many pagurids completed
one or two steps and then left the vicinity of the anemone.
The anemone's response to these actions varied. Normally
only those tentacles being contacted while being brushed or
poked responded with retraction. Within a couple of minutes
these tentacles were again fully extended. However, 1 out of
10 anemones responded by slowly and completely closing. It took
from 20 minutes to 45 minutes for the anemone to relax and reÂ¬
open. Once acclimation occurred, the only response was an
occasional retraction of a tentacle as it was contacted. As
the crab walked among the tentacles, it stroked each tentacle
in its path with its antennae. Again, as when acclimating, the
antennae would occasionally be brought to the body.
