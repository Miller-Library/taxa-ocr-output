Distribution and Density
A comparison of anemone density, hermit crab density, and
their association in the study area is shown in Figure 1.
West Beach had an average density of 2.7 anemones/m whereas
Bird Rock Beach showed 6.2 anemones/m2. These were significantly
different by the student t-test (p..05). In the sparsely
populated West Beach area 733 of the anemones were A. xantho¬
grammica and only 188 A. xanthogrammica along Bird Rock Beach.
The remaining percentages were A. elegantissima. In contrast,
the proportion of crabs grazing on the tentacles and columns
along West Beach was .25 crabs/anemone as compared to Bird

Rock Beach where there was .5 crabs/anemone.
significant difference p..025 (Rx C contingency test).
Acclimation
Upon first encounter with the sea anemone, the hermit crabs
exhibited a behavior I call "poking and retreating." The crabs
approached an extended anemone and with their antennae and
chelipeds poked at the tips of the anemone's tentacles. Imme¬
diately after each poke they jumped back and retreated a
distance. In between pokes the crabs often explored or fed
on the immediate area of the rock. This continued for 5 to
30 pokes.
Once this behavior was completed, the crabs began a period
of brushing their shells on the tentacles of the anemone. Most
often the crabs faced away from the anemone, held on to the
substrate and placed their shells in contact with the tentacles,
