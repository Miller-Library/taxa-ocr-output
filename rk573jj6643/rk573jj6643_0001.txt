ABSTRACT
The hermit crabs Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus
granosimanis live in close association with the sea
anemones Anthopleura xanthogrammica and Anthopleura
elegantissima in the intertidal region at Hopkins
Marine Station. The crabs are often observed walking
on the columns and tentacles of the anemone without
any response from the nematocysts. This appears
similar in many ways to the relationship established
between the tropical anemone fish and their hosts.
The hermit crabs go through a sequence of beÂ¬
havior in which they acquire a coating of mucus from
contact with the anemone. The mucus is acquired
through a series of behavioral steps exhibited by the
crabs: poking, brushing, and stroking the anemone.
Once acclimated, the crab freely walks among the
tentacles feeding off of small food particles stuck
to the Anthopleura and even removing food from the gut
of its host. The protective mucus coat gradually loses
its effectiveness if the hermit crab is isolated from
anemones. This is a symbiotic relationship benefiting
the crabs by providing a source of food and protection
from a potential predator.
