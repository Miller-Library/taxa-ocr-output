for over 5 weeks there were still 208 unacclimated. This may
result from some intraspecific differences in behavior,
social exclusion, stage of life cycle, or simple differences
in opportunity. It is certainly an aspect of the study that
requires more work.
The acclimation behavior pattern of the hermit crabs has
some interesting parallels with the acclimation behavior
described for the tropical anemone fish. The initial poking
and retreating behavior resembles the nibbling of the fish at
the base of the column and tentacles. The fish behavior of
diving into the tentacles and wriggling through them seems to
correspond to the crab's behavior of rubbing the shell on the
column and tentacles of the anemone. This probably indicates
the most effective behavioral sequence for acclimation to the
anemones is strongly conditioned by general properties of the
responses of anthozoan cnidoblasts and nerve net. If the
initial approach is too abrupt the anemone will be stimulated
into either feeding or protective withdrawal behavior and thus
terminate the encounter.
The poking and retreating initiates contact with the
tentacles and may orient the crab to the responses of the
anemone and begins habituation of the anemone to the crab,
This step probably accumulates mucus on the cheliped surfaces
and antennae. The brushing maneuver exposes the shell to
the mucus and brings it closer to the entire crab acclimation.
Shell acclimation is crucial to the crab for movement through
