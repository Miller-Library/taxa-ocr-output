MATERIALS AND METHODS
Anthopleura xanthogrammica, Anthopleura elegantissima,
samuelis, and Pagurus granosimanis were all collected at Hopkins
Marine Station on Cabrillo Point, in Pacific Grove, California.
All experiments were conducted either in the field or in tanks
and aquaria with running seawater. One 40 gallon tank and two
10 gallon aquaria were used for all lab experiments. The 40
gallon tank was located outside, exposed to direct sunlight for
approximately 5 hours a day.
The aquaria were located in the
lab with no direct sunlight.
Each tank and aquarium was
decorated to simulate a rocky, sandy tide pool. The anemones
and crabs were fed a diet of Mytilus, barnacles, and a variety
of limpets. All observations at night were conducted with a
red light.
Hopkins intertidal area evidently offers a very suitable
habitat for A. xanthogrammica and A. elegantissima to grow and
multiply as there is an abundance of both species. Also present
in the same area are Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanis
in great abundance. The research was limited to these two
species of hermit crabs and their association with Anthopleura
of the size range 5 cm. to 11 cm.
Once transferred to the aquaria, the anemones took approxiÂ¬
mately 3 to 5 days to attach and show normal behavior. One
noticeable change in behavior was that within a week the stick
iness of the tentacles decreased (Mariscal, 1966). For this
reason fresh anemones were brought in each week. The hermit
crabs taken from the same tidepools in field showed no apparent
