Some crabs were feeding off of the small particles stuck
to the tentacles. On three different occasions, I noticed a
crab aggressively entering through the tentacles of an
A. xanthogrammica and inserting its chelipeds into the gastric
cavity, withdrawing chunks of food and eating. One final obÂ¬
servation was the crab dislodging detritus which accumulated
on the tentacles.
Adhesion Tests
As seen in Table 1, the acclimated Tegula shells had very
little, if any, adhesion to the tentacles. This lasted for
several days but adhesion did increase from 1.5 gms. to 7.5
gms. within the week. The unacclimated shells registered an
average of 20 gms. or greater with each trial.
The results on the number of acclimated crabs after 2 months
in the aquarium with anemones showed 32 out of 40 or 803
acclimation as compared to 47 out of 120 or 398 for those sampled
in the field.
Discharged nematocysts were found on 5 out of 6 of the
acclimated crabs. The nematocysts were visible under the
compound microscope at 40x power and could be positively
identified at 100x magnification. Methylene blue dye colored
each nematocyst a bright purple.
It was obvious with the dissecting microscope that carbon
particles had settled in denser patches on the acclimated
shells. The particles appeared supported on a mucus layer
that held them above the shell as seen with 45x magnification
