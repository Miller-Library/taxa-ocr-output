and the force required to free the shell was recorded.
To test for persistence of the acclimated state 50 empty
Tegula shells were acclimated by wiping them on the tentacles
of anemones. These were held in an aquarium with running sea
water along with 50 unacclimated Tegula shells. Tests were
made for the adhesion to anemone tentacles for samples of 5 of
each category for the first day at 1 hour intervals after
acclimation for 3 hours and then daily for 7 days (refer to
Table 1).
Haphazard samples of 40 crabs in 3 separate tidepools in
the field were tested for acclimation. A simulated tidepool
was set up by placing 40 unacclimated crabs into an aquarium
with two A. xanthogrammica and after 5½ weeks the number of
crabs which were acclimated was recorded.
Mucus and Nematocyst Verification
In the final experiment to verify mucus accumulation 5
acclimated and 5 non-acclimated shells were placed in flasks
with suspended carbon particles. The flasks sat for 24 hours
to allow normal settling. Observations were made under a
dissecting microscope to detect the presence of mucus.
For a verification of nematocyst discharge following crab
contact with the anemone, observations were made before and
after actual contact with the anemone. Nematocysts were
stained using methylene blue dye after scrapings were trans¬
ferred from the chelipeds and shell to cover slips.
