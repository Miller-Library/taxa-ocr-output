of the dissecting microscope. The unacclimated shells also
accumulated some carbon particles but not nearly as much.
All five acclimated shells were easily differentiated by eye
inspection from the unacclimated, once the particles had
settled.
It was also noticed throughout the study that a crab
acclimated to A. elegantissima was acclimated to both A. elegan¬
tissima and A. xanthogrammica. However, those acclimated to
A. xanthogrammica were not acclimated to A. elegantissima.
DISCUSSION
These studies indicate intertidal hermit crabs can become
acclimated to the large carnivorous anemones that share their
habitat. The association is in many ways similar to the many
observations that have been made on the clownfish and their
host anemones. There are however a significant number of
differences. They are similar in that a sequence of behavioral
steps is performed in which the symbiote acquires a coating of
anemone mucus which is necessary to gain immunity from the
host's nematocysts (Mariscal, 1966) (Davenport and Norris, 1958)
A recent investigation by (Lubbock, 1980) claims that the
immunity is attributable to special properties of the endo¬
genously produced mucus of anemone fish. It differs from the
mucus of other fish in being much thicker and contains neutral
polysaccharide rather than acidic ones. Hermit crabs produce
no external mucus and only lose their stickiness to anemone
tentacles after exposure to anemone mucus.
