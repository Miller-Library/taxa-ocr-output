The two differ in specificity of association between
symbiote and host. The fish establishes onehost and will
return in preference to another anemone. The hermit crabs
are not closely tied to one anemone and are acclimated to and
visit a number of anemones in their range. While the clown¬
fish receives protection from the anemone's tentacles, the crab
benefits by feeding from the tentacles and actually with¬
drawing food from the anemone's gut. The crab-anemone asso¬
ciation is essentially a commensal symbiotic relationship
benefiting the crab whereas the anemone also benefits from the
fish categorizing it as mutualistic symbiosis (Mariscal, 1966).
The exposed, steeply graded, rocky West Beach area has a
lower density of sea anemones than the protected Bird Rock
region and they are primarily A. xanthogrammica. Despite all
of these differences this study revealed a remarkable similarity
in the pattern of association between the hermit crabs and
their host anemones. It is possible that the advantages to
the crabs in associating with the anemones compensate for the
many environmental differences. This is further supported by
the observation of marked stability of residency of crabs in
pools with anemones compared to pools without.
Another intriguing observation involved the percentage
of the hermit crab population in the Bird Rock transect areas
which were acclimated to anemones. In an area with an abundance
of anemones many clonal ones in addition to the large solitary
forms, only 408 of the crabs were acclimated. In the aquarium
where the hermit crabs were left in contact with the anemones
