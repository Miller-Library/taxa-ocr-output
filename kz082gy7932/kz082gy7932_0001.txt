Abstract
Neurological research on escape response in the squid Loligo opalescens has
raised the possibility that active feeding behavior post hatching stimulates
development of adult-like control over the use of giant axons in both escape and
attack jets. This study provides behavioral evidence to support that hypothesis, by
comparing the attack behavior developed by hatchlings raised on prey which
required an active pursuit and capture strategy with that of hatchlings raised on
slow-moving prey.
2 groups of squid were given slow-moving prey post hatching and introduced
to fast-moving prey at different stages in the life cycle to determine (i) whether
attack behavior varied with prey type; (ii) if so, whether feeding behavior could be
successfully adapted to new prey; and (iii) if there was an optimal time for this
transition to take place. The squid developed strikingly different capture techniques
for slow and fast prey. Animals given fast-moving copepods on day 10 modified
their prey capture behavior sufficently for adequate survival on the fast prey. Squid
given copepods on day 34 failed to alter their attack behavior, were unable to capture
enough prey and died of starvation within 10 days.
It is proposed that effective prey capture behavior involves the use of the
giant axon system in an adult-like manner, and can only be stimulated by exposure
to fast-moving prey. Exposure must occur during a short critical period after
hatching (less than 33 days) for normal behavioral and nervous development to
take place.
