Mortality for Group 2 squid was high over days 5-13, fell and
remained constant until day 32, and increased dramatically after day
40.
Slow prey was given on days 1-33 (shaded bars); fast prey was
introduced day 34 (marked with arrow) and fed until day 43 (dark bars).
Mortality is plotted as a daily percentage.
Mortality for group 3 peaked between days 7-12 and days 15-16.
Mortalities were then low until a third rise on days 42-44.
Slow prey was given from days 1-10 (shaded bars) and fast prey from
days 10-44 (dark bars). An arrow marks the introduction of fast prey.
Comparison of attacks made per minute on fast and slow prey,
introduced to squid of different ages.
Figure 3A compares the number of attacks made by Groups 2 and 3
during their first 10 days of exposure to fast prey. Both groups made
increasing numbers of attacks until days 3-4 of exposure. Group 2's
attack rate then declined permanently (circle symbols) but Group 3's
rose steadily after reaching a minimum on day 6 (square symbols).
Figure 3B shows that Group 2 made no attacks on days 1-5 of exposure
to slow-moving prey, and that the attack rate fluctuated around a low
level thereafter.
Stages of a typical feeding attack.
Successful steps leading to prey capture are shown at left. Alternative
behaviors which would abort the attack are described on the right.
Stars indicate the points at which backwards escape jets may be made.
Group 2 made high percentages of successful attacks on slow-moving
prey from days 6-21; percentages of incomplete attacks were even
higher. The percentages of missed and "release" attacks were low.
