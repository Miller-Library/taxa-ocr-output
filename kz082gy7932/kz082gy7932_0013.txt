feeding Artemia, ideal rearing conditions might include a diet of both fast and slow
prey from birth. Copepods would stimulate the development of tight control over
giant axon boosts during feeding attacks, while Artemia would provide more easily
accessible calories. The nauplii could be gradually replaced with larger fast-moving
prey such as mysids, to stimulate further growth.
The results of this study allow speculation about squid development in the
wild. Development of adult-like control of prey capture and possibly escape
behavior seems dependent on early exposure to high density, fast-moving prey.
Without this experience, squid might suffer behavioral consequences such as loss of
ability to capture valuable fast-moving prey, failure to recognize such prey, or
impaired ability to escape from predators. If animals in a controlled environment
have difficulty adapting to changing prey conditions during the 6-7 weeks post
hatching, wild squid must be very vulnerable to fluctuations in marine ecosystems.
Experience during the first weeks of life would determine the viability of their
nervous systems and behavioral repertoire for adulthood.
Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Dr. Bill Gilly for advice, patience, criticism and the squid
house. I am very grateful to Gil van Dykhuizen and the Husbandry Staff of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium for allowing me to participate in the squid culture project,
making this study possible.
The generosity of Sam Wang and the Stuart Thompson lab with their time
and equipment was much appreciated, and I am also grateful for Freya Sommer and
John Lee's assistance with construction of the pseudo-Kreisel.
Finally, many thanks to Sarah Gilman for invaluable help with data
processing and figure preparation.
