Group 2 made extremely low percentages of successful attacks on fast
prey (given from day 34-day 43) and very high percentages of "miss"
attacks. Ã„fter day 36, few attacks were incomplete.
Group 3 made low percentages of successful attacks on fast prey (given
from day 10) and high percentages of missed attacks. Proportions of
incomplete attacks were generally low, except immediately following
the heavy mortality which occurred on day 15 (marked with arrow).
When slow prey was given on days 31-33 (indicated by white bars),
percentage consumption was higher and the proportion of missed
attacks lower. More attacks were incomplete, however.
8 A: A high proportion of Group 2's unsuccessful attacks on copepods
were followed by inappropriate escape jets. Over the same period of
time, a much lower proportion of Group 3's unsuccessful attacks were
followed by escape jets (Group 3 had been previously exposed to
copepods for 23 days). The total number of attempts observed on each
day is shown below the data point.
8 B: Complementary data for the frequency of unsuccessful attacks not
followed by an escape jet.
