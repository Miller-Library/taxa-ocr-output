diversity of Symbiodinium in A. sola could also be a factor of elevated diversity in A. sola, a
strictly sexually reproducing species, compared to A. elegantissima, a clonal species. It stands to
reason that in populations of equal number, a population which contains no clones would have
more genetic diversity than a population that contains clones. This elevated diversity in host
might well mean elevated ability to form symbiotic relationships with more diverse symbionts,
and might also be a factor contributing to A. sola's larger habitat range.
Latitudinal replacement, with one anomalous site
Data show tri-partite latitudinal replacement of Symbiodinium types. Results suggest that
type I is a cold-adapted Symbiodinium, type II is cool-adapted, and type III is warm-adapted.
The trend of latitudinal replacement is marred by a homogenous population of type III
Symbiodinium, all of the same haplotype, at Coal Oil Point (site C). A plausible reason for this
anomaly is the ocean circulation patterns in the Santa Barbara Channel around Coal Oil Point
during June, when A. sola spawns (McFadden et al. 1997). A map of surface currents in the
Santa Barbara Channel from the UCSB Ocean Surface Currents Mapping Project on a typical
June day shows strong eddy formation, which isolates water in the Santa Barbara Channel from
the California Current (Fig. 6.). These currents might have caused the isolated population of
type III Symbiodinium at Coal Oil Point, since there would appear to be little interaction with
populations coming from the North or South.
Different Symbiodinium in A. sola and A. elegantissima
Jon Sanders (personal communication) identified 4 haplotypes of Symbiodinium in
Anthopleura elegantissima. Of those four, only the "southern" haplotype shares the same
