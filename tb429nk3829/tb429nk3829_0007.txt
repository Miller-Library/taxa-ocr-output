DISCUSSION
Much haplotype diversity exists within and among sites
A. sola Symbiodinium showed a surprisingly high degree of diversity considering there
were 7 unique haplotypes out of the 55 good sequences. A similar study by LaJeunesse and
Trench (2000) of Symbiodinium in Anthopleura that compared 64 individuals (37 A.
elegantissima and 27 A. sola) found only one type- and they sampled a latitudinal range more
than twice as large as the one in this study. Jon Sanders (personal communication), in a similar
study of A. elegantissima from Oregon to Southern California with about 100 samples, recorded
only 4 types of unique haplotypes, with only two types supported in a bootstrap analysis.
Within individual sites there was much diversity, with 4 of the 6 sites containing mixed
populations of Symbiodinium. A study of A. elegantissima showed no mixing of Symbiodinium
types at any sites (Fig. 5, Jon Sanders, personal communication).
The reason for elevated diversity in Symbiodinium in A. sola compared to A.
elegantissima can only be hypothesized. One possibility relates to the habitats in which the two
species are found: A. sola inhabits the mid- to low intertidal and extends subtidally as well, while
A. elegantissima has a range higher up in the intertidal. The higher intertidal experiences more
severe environmental conditions, which might explain why there is less Symbiodinium diversity.
Another possibility is difference in habitat for symbionts within the host: A. sola has a maximum
diameter of about 25 cm, while at its largest A. elegantissima is only 10 cm in diameter, but
usually is closer to 6 cm. That means A. sola has more than five times as much tissue volume
which could host more Symbiodinium types in niches that may not exist in A. elegantissima. The
