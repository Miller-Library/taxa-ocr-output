27 solitary and 37 clonal specimens, citing the presence of two species of Symbiodinium, S.
muscatinei belonging to clade B and S. californium of unknown clade. S. californium was later
shown to be a contaminant free-living dinoflagellate (Jon Sanders, personal communication).
Sanders (2005) described the presence of three types of Symbiodinium in a survey of A.
elegantissima from southern Oregon to Monterey Bay, California.
Given the recent designation of Anthopleura sola as a separate species, work has yet to be
done to determine many baseline data among this species and its symbiont(s). This study
identified and compared populations of Symbiodinium within A. sola across about 800 kilometers
of A. sola's central range from Monterey Bay, California to San Diego California. Analysis of
the chloroplast 23s ribosomal RNA gene was used to delineate differences in populations of
Symbiodinium.
The main questions I hoped to answer were: Which Symbiodinium are symbiotic with A.
sola? Are the same Symbiodinium found in A. sola and A. elegantissima?
Based on the prior studies of A. elegantissima, which looked at both the clonal and
solitary forms (i.e. A. sola) and which found only a single Symbiodinium species present at any
one site, the na√Øve null hypothesis is that the Symbiodinium populations found in A. sola are the
same as those found in A. elegantissima.
