sequence as any of A. sola’s Symbiodinium. Coincidentally, the matching haplotype happens to
be the most common haplotype among the Symbiodinium populations identified in this study,
and it occurs predominantly in Southern California, which is the middle of A. sola's range.
Since genetic evidence suggests A. elegantissima and A. sola are recently diverged sister species
(Geller and Walton 2001), I hypothesize that this matching symbiont haplotype is a carry-over
from when the two species were not yet diverged. I posit the two species diverged in Southern
California, A. elegantissima being the basal species, and A. sola has diversified in habitat and
symbiont, expanding its range from Southern California up to the North, where it is evolving
new symbiotic relationships. Possibly the Symbiodinium and A. sola are co-evolving.
CONCLUSIONS
Preliminary analyses of Symbiodinium in A. sola led to rejection of the null hypothesis
that the Symbiodinium populations found in A. sola are the same as those found in A.
elegantissima. More than two-fold magnitude of diversity in haplotypes was found in A. sola
symbionts compared to A. elegantissima symbionts. Symbiodinium were classified into three
main types, which showed tri-partite latitudinal replacement. The anomalous site to the tri¬
partite latitudinal replacement can be explained by isolating ocean currents. The presence of
only one common haplotype between A. sola and A. elegantissima suggest possible historical
populations and co-evolution between symbiont and host.
Symbiodinium in the two sister species A. sola and A. elegantissima seems a good system
in which to study host-symbiont interaction and diversity.
