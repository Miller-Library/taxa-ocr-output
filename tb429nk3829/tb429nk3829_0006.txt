RESULTS
Five samples failed to amplify and several samples did not sequence cleanly or showed
mixed sequences, which were not analyzed. The number of clean sequences obtained from the
original 12 samples taken at each of the six sites are as follows (note that sites have been given
letter designations starting with A at the northernmost site to F at the southernmost): site A, 7;
site B, 11; site C, 10; site D,9; site E, 12; site F, 6 (Table 1).
Preliminary sequence data show much haplotype diversity both among and within sites
(Fig. 2). As shown on the phylogram, Symbiodinium populations can be grouped into two main
types, roughly equating to northern and southern populations (Fig. 2). Cladogram bootstrap
values indicate strong support (78) for the North-South population node (Fig. 3). The cladogram
also depicts moderate bootstrap support (65) for a second node within the northern type (Fig. 3).
These three distinct types of Symbiodinium are labeled types I, II, III and graphed according to
site (Fig. 4A). Data show tri-partite latitudinal replacement of Symbiodinium types (Fig. 4B).
Type lwas the only Symbiodinium haplotype present in the northernmost site (A). Going south.
it was still the dominant type in Big Sur (B), but type III was also present in low levels. Only
type III was present in the Santa Barbara Channel (C). The final three, low latitude sites,
White's Point (D), Dana Point (E), and Cabrillo Point (F), were populated with types II and III.
Type II was more common at White's Point (D) and Dana Point (E), while type III was more
common at the southernmost site, Cabrillo Point (F).
