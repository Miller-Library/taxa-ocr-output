ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 would like to thank George Somero for leading the Bio175H course and serving as an
advisor and editor throughout the quarter. Thanks also to Steve Palumbi for serving as an
advisor to my project, and allowing me use of his laboratory. Vicki Pearse was instrumental in
many aspects of this project from start to finish, as she is the resident expert on A. sola. Special
thanks to Kristy Deiner, Emily Jacobs-Palmer, Melissa Pespeni, Brent Lockwood, Tom Oliver,
and Jon Sanders for teaching me everything I know about laboratory genetics - the Palumbi lab
is the most fun and friendly lab I have come to know. And thanks again to Jon; he had the
permit, and the bio-diesel vehicle and the experience to make the collecting road trip - and the
project - happen. I hope we get a chance to finish what we have started.
