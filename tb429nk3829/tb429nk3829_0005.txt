adding 0.5 ul of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP, Amersham Pharmacia), 0.5 ul of
exonuclease I (Exo I, Amersham Pharmacia), and 1 ul of dilution buffer and then incubated for
15 min at 37° followed by 15 min at 80°. Cycle sequencing of cleaned PCR product was
achieved with forward and reverse CP23s ribosomal RNA gene primers (Rowan and Powers
1991) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyzer.
Analysis
Sequences were grouped according to sample site and aligned using Sequencher 4.5
(Gene Codes Corporation). After sequences were visually cleaned and mixed sequences
removed, unique haplotypes were noted. Sample sequences were then compared across sites and
with A. elegantissima Symbiodinium sequences from Sanders (personal communication) using
PAUP*4.0 to generate maximum parsimony trees. Generic clade B Symbiodinium was used as
an outgroup and a heuristic bootstrap analysis of 20 replicates was run on the maximum
parsimony tree.
