INTRODUCTION
Zooxanthellae, golden-brown endosymbiotic algae, commonly of the genus
Symbiodinium, are important symbionts in the life cycles of many protists, corals, sea anemones,
and bivalves (Droop 1963; McLaughlin and Zahl 1966; Trench 1987). The symbiotic
interactions between invertebrates and algal endosymbionts are an important source of primary
productivity in the world ocean. Studies of Symbiodinium have shown much diversity within
members of the genus (Rowan 1998). Being aware of the diversity of algal symbionts in species
of symbiont-containing invertebrates is a first step towards understanding host-symbiont
interactions and what adaptive advantages these interactions provide.
Along the North American Pacific coast, anemone species of the genus Anthopleura are
commonly found to be in symbiotic relationships with members of the genus Symbiodinium.
There are more than 30 named species within the genus Anthopleura (Duchassaing and
Michelotti, 1860), both clonal and solitary, zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate (Geller and
Walton 2001). Three sister species, Anthopleura elegantissima, A. sola and A. xanthogrammica,
are zooxanthellate and found cohabitating along the central California coast. A. sola was
previously known in the literature as the solitary form of A. elegantissima until it was proven to
be a separate non-interbreeding species (Pearse and Francis 2000).
Studies of the Symbiodinium communities in Anthopleura have focused on A.
elegantissima, both the clonal and solitary forms. Rowan and Powers (1991) identified only one
species of Symbiodinium, belonging to clade B, in samples collected from Pacific Grove,
California. Rowan (1998) noted that their analyses of the partial small subunit ribosomal DNA
(SSUrRNA) sequences underestimate diversity. LaJeunesse and Trench (2000) did a survey of
Symbiodinium in A. elegantissima at six sites from Washington to Southern California, sampling
