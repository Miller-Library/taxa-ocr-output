ABSTRACT
Endosymbiotic algae, commonly of the genus Symbiodinium, are important in the life
cycles of many marine invertebrates. Being aware of the diversity of algal symbionts in species
of symbiont-containing invertebrates is a first step towards understanding host-symbiont
interactions and what adaptive advantages these interactions provide. The symbionts of a
common Californian intertidal sea anemone, Anthopleura sola, were surveyed across a
latitudinal gradient of approximately 800 km. A. sola samples were collected at six sites from
Monterey Bay to San Diego, California. Analysis of the chloroplast 23s ribosomal RNA gene
showed three distinct types of Symbiodinium (types I, II, III). Data show previously unknown
diversity in Anthopleura symbionts in a tri-partite latitudinal replacement of Symbiodinium types.
Type I was the only Symbiodinium haplotype present in Monterey, the northernmost site. Going
south, it was still the dominant type in Big Sur, but type III was also present in low levels. Only
type III was present in the Santa Barbara Channel. The final three, low latitude sites, White's
Point, Dana Point, and Cabrillo Point, were populated with types II and III. Type II was more
common at White's Point and Dana Point, while type III was more common at the southernmost
site, Cabrillo Point. Results suggest that type I is a cold-adapted Symbiodinium, type II is coolÂ¬
adapted, and type III is warm-adapted.
