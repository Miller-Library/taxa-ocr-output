FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1. Map showing A. sola collection sites.
Fig. 2. Phylogram showing haplotypes of all samples of Symbiodinium from A. sola. Included
are all known haplotypes of A. elegantissima for comparison (Jon Sanders, personal
communication).
Fig. 3. Cladogram showing bootstrap values. Sequences are grouped into three major types:
types I, II, and III.
Fig. 4. Symbiodinium types are graphed by site, showing percentages of each type at each site in
a percentage bar graph (A) as well as in pie graphs on a map corresponding to sample location
(B).
Fig. 5. Phylogram showing haplotypes of all samples of Symbiodinium from A. elegantissima
(Jon Sanders, personal communication).
Fig. 6. Map of surface currents in the Santa Barbara Channel showing typical patterns for the
month of June (UCSB Ocean Surface Currents Mapping Project).
