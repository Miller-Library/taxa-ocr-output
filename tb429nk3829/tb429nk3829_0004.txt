MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimen collection
Anthopleura sola samples were collected at six sites along the California coast (Fig. 1.) at
China Point, Pacific Grove (N36° 37'; W121° 54); San Geronimo Road, Cayucos (N35
W120° 56); Coal Oil Point, Santa Barbara (N34° 25'; W119° 52'), White’s Point, San Pedro
(N33° 43'; W118° 182), Dana Point, Dana Point (N33° 28; W117° 43'), and Cabrillo Point, San
Diego (N32° 40'; WI17° 15’). At each site, twelve A. sola individuals were sampled from as
many habitats as possible by taking tentacle clippings, using scissors that were washed in
seawater between individuals to remove any tissue from the previous individual. Each sample
was placed in a 2.5ml tube. The tubes were then filled with 95% alcohol and placed in the
refrigerator once back at the laboratory
Genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and DNA Sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from two to three tentacle clips (about 25 mg) using a
NucleoSpin OTissue kit and protocol for proteinase digestion and spin-column separation
(Macherey-Nagel Inc., Easton, PA).
The chloroplast 23s ribosomal RNA gene was amplified from 1 ul of genomic DNA
using primers of Zhang et al. (2000) and the following reaction volumes: 16.875 ul H2O, 2.5 ul
dNTPs, 2.5 ul MgClz buffer, 0.125 ul EconoTaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), and 1 ul
each forward and reverse primers. PCR amplifications were done on a Peltier thermal cycler
with an initial denaturing step of 1 min at 95° followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 95°, 45 s at 50°.
60 s at 72°, followed by a single cycle of 7 min at 72°. The PCR product was cleaned up by
