Politis, G.P.: Internal Parasites of a Sanddab Page 2
INTRODUCTION
Parasitologists have been aware for many decades that fishes
serve as hosts for a variety of helminth and protozoan parasites. In
1965, Mackenzie and Gibson reported a diverse parasite community ex¬
isting in the flat fishes flounder and plaice from the coast of England.
Their study is probably the only detailed study ever published on para¬
site distribution and incidence in flat fish, and it is safe to say
that there have been no published studies on parasites of the flat fish
Citharichthys sordidus, the Pacific Sanddab. This paper describes five
prevalent internal parasites of Citharichthys sordidus, and reports on
the incidences of infection, average parasite loads per sanddab, and
distributions of parasites within the host and host population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sanddabs were collected by bottom fishing in Monterey Bay, nearly
one mile northwest of Lovers Point, during the month of May. The study
began with complete examinations of five sanddabs. The fishes were
killed just prior to examination, by slicing the spinal cord immediately
posterior to the operculum, and all the internal organs were inspected
according to methods described by Amlacher (1970). Four parasites were
found during this initial survey, and the study was narrowed to these
more prevalent parasites.
The weight, length, and sex were recorded prior to the inspection
of each fish. The visceral cavity (Figure 1) was inspected with a di¬
