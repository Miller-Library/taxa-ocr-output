Politis, G.P.: Internal Parasites of a Sanddab Page 4
RESULTS
The following data has been tabulated by assuming that parasite
loads are independent of sanddab size and sex. The basis for this
assumption was that Mann Whitney U-tests indicated no coorelation ex¬
ists between host sex and parasite loads, and scatter plots showed no
coorelation between host size and parasite load.
Fifteen out of fifteen gallbladders examined were infected by
Ceratomyxa hopkinsi, a myxosporidean of the family Ceratomyxidae.
Identification was made according to Kudo (1966). Ceratomyxa spores
ranged in length from approximately 25um to 50gm, averaging about 40m.
Mature digenetic trematodes of the family Hemiuridae (identifica¬
tion was according to Schell (1970)) were present in either the stomach
or esophagus in 49% of the sanddabs. Figure 2 shows the hermaphroditic
sac which is chacteristic of the family Hemiuridae. Hemiurids ranged
from 1.5mm to 2.8mm, averaging 2.4mm (n=5), and had a mean load of 2.0
per sanddab. The concentration of hemiurids was greatest in the anter¬
ior end of the stomach; 21% were found on the esophagus, and 54% were
found on the anterior half of the stomach (Table 1). Assuming that
sampling of sanddabs was random, a Xø test determined that there was a
significant difference between the number of trematodes found on the
anterior half of the stomach and the number found on the posterior
half (p-.05).
Nematodes of the family Anisakidae were abundent in the pyloric
caeca and intestine. The muscular pharynx and intestinal caecum were
identifying characteristics, according to Hyman (1951). Six of 7
