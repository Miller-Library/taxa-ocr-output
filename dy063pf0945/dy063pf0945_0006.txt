Gibson (1970) reported that osmotic pressure of the gut fluid decreases
down the length of the gut. If there is a difference in osmotic pressure
within the stomach, the trematodes positioned anteriorly would be under
greater osmotic stress and less likely to survive there. Perhaps the
most interesting thing about the Hemiuridae data is the strange occur¬
ence of twenty-four hemiurids on a single sanddab. The life cycle of a
digenetic trematode involves intermediate hosts and so we know the
large number of hemiurids was not a result of reproduction on behalf
of hemiurids already in the stomach. Possibly, metacercaria of this
hemiurid are clumped within the population of the intermediate host on
which sanddabs prey, or intermediate hosts are clumped in areas along
the bottom.
Taxonomy was a problem with the Anisakidae nematodes; the number of
species of Anisakidae present in the sanddab was not determined. How¬
ever, all the Anisakidae found should be of the genera Contracaecum or
Porocaecum, since Hyman (1951) reports that species of those two genera
are the only anisakids found in marine fish. The occurence of larger
nematodes in the visceral cavity andishorter ones in the digestive tract,
indicates that the genus Contracaecum is probably present. According to
Hyman, the typical life cycle of Contracaecum begins with eggs being
passed into the water along with feces of the definative host. These
eggs develop into an infective juvenile which is eaten by an intermedi¬
ate host (usually a fish). The juvenile develops in the host's intest¬
ine, and as it gets larger it bores through the intestine and inhabits
body spaces. The intermediate host is eaten by the definative host
