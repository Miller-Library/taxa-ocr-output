secting microscope before any organs were removed. Physiological
saline (0.9% Nacl) was periodically applied to the surface of organs
during the examination. Gall bladder fluid was extracted with a sy¬
ringe and examined microscopically. The stomach and esophagus were re¬
moved, cut open, and viewed with a disecting microscope. The light
source was put below the tissue, and forceps were used to spread the
folds of the wall to locate hidden helminths. The intestine and py¬
loric caeca were examined in the same manner as the stomach and esoph¬
agus. The intestinal wall was inspected by cutting a small piece,
rinsing it in distilled water, and flattening it for microscopic exam¬
ination.
The ability of Trypanorhynchid larvae to survive an anaerobic en¬
vironment was evaluated by placing them in a stoppered test tube of
deoxygenated (nitrogenated) physiological saline. The experiment was
run at a temperature of 220 and a pH of 6.
An attempt to induce Trypanorhynchid larvae to develop to their
adult stage was done by putting the larvae in physiological saline
solutions of pHs equal to 2, 3, and 4. Solutions were prepared by mix¬
ing dilute HCI with physiological saline, and using a pH meter to ob¬
tain the desired pHs.
Viability of trypanorhynchid larvae was determined by preparing a
slide and examining the scolex region for motion. When no motion was
observed, gradually increasing pressure was applied to the coverslip
until either motion was observed or the larva exploded.
