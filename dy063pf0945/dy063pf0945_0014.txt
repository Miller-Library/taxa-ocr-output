Figure 1
Dorsal view of anatomical feature that are discussed in this
paper.
Figure 2
Ventral view of a flattened hemiurid tremitode, taken from the
stomach. The distance from the center of the anterior sucker
to the center of the ventral sucker represents approx. Imm.
Figure 3
Flattened trypanorhynchid larvae from the visceral cavity.
Figure 4
Representation of the expected number of sanddabs with a given
trypanorhynchid load (according to a Poisson distribution)
versus the observed number. The bars represent the observed
number and the lines represent the expected. Groupings of
trypanorhynchid loads were divided unequally to obtain expect-
ed values of at least five so that a X test could be run.
