adjacent mesentaries. Trypanorhynchids were typically found in clumps,
and often were in close proximity with nematodes; 11% had nematodes
coiled around them.
A Poisson distribution was calculated to determine what would be
the expected number of sanddabs with various trypanorhynchid loads, pro¬
vided each infection was independent of all others (Figure 4). A X
test value showed that the observed values were significantly different
from the expected values (p is less than .01), indicating some type of
dependence of infections upon one another.
Five trypanorhynchid larvae were put into solutions of pH
equal to 2, 3, and 4, to try to induce development. All five larvae
in a pH of 2 had died by eight hours, while the larvae in pHs of 3 and
4 were still alive after 10 days. None of the larvae showed any sign
of a morphological or behavioral change. Also, no change was observed
in larvae that had been living for six weeks in a solution with a pH
of 6.
DISCUSSION
The myxosporidean Ceratomyxa hopkinsi was consistently present
in the gall bladder of Citharichthys sordidus. Jameson (1929) reported
that Ceratomyxa hopkinsi was present in the gall bladder of Citharich¬
thys xanthostigma, but this is the first report of its occurence in
Citharichthys sordidus.
The significantly greater (p-.05) concentration of trematodes in
the anterior region of the stomach is hard to explain. Mackenzie and
