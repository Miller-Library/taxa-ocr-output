Politis, G.P.: Internal Parasites of a Sanddab Page 5
sanddabs were infected inside the intestine, with a mean of 3.6 Anis¬
akidae. Four of 7 were infected in the pyloric caeca, with a mean load
of 1.6. The length of Anisakidae from inside the digestive tract
ranged from 2mm to 8mm, with a mean of 5.4mm.
Larval nematodes were found encysted in the walls of both the py¬
loric caecae and intestines in 6 out of 6 sanddabs. They were not
encapsulated and were approximately .5mm in length.
Anisakidae were also found in the body cavity, and occured with an
incidence of 90%. They ranged from 5mm to 30mm in length, with a mean
of 12.9nm. Of 57 anisakids from the visceral cavity, 30% were found
attached to either the pyloric caeca, or it's adjacent mesentaries,
and 30% were found on the mesentary in the cavity below the liver.
On one occasion 7 metacercaria of the digenetic trematode Acantho¬
colpidae Stephanostomum sp. were found, and were attached to mesentary
between the intestine and spleen.
Plerocercoid larva of a cestode from the order Trypanorhyncha
were abundant in the visceral cavity. These encapsulated larvae had
a fully developed scolex, equipped with four spiny proboscides. The
scolex region was invaginated in the receptaculum of the blastocyst
(Figure 3) but could be extruded. Trypanorhynchids ranged from Imm
to Amm in length, with a mean of 1.9mm (n-10), and had a mean load of
10 per sanddab. A concentration of trypanorhynchids were located in
the area of the spleen and pyloric caeca; 28% were on the mesentaries
adjacent to the spleen, and 28% were on the pyloric caeca or it's
