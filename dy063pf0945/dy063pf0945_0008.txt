Politis, G.P.: Internal Parasites of a Sanddab Page 9
The fact that trypanorhynchids survive for over a week without
oxygen indicates that they use a very small amount of oxygen or have
an extraordinary capability to go into oxygen debt. Their ability to
live for over six weeks in an anaérobic environment implies that their
respiration rate is extremely low. Probably they enter a state of tor¬
por, and wait for an external cue to resume development. What the cue
might be is unclear, but it does not seem to be a low pH.
Coexistence of anisakids and trypanorhynchids suggests that there
may be a symbiotic relationship between them. On the other hand, these
helminths could be found together soley because of a shared interest
in some resource or enviromental condition.
Three points about this study are worth mentioning. Firstly, time
was limited, making sample sizes smaller than desirable. Consequently,
the assumption that there is not a coorelation between parasite loads and
host size or sex could be incorrect. Secondly, an analysis of statisti¬
cal significance of trypanorhynchid and anisakid distributions could
not be done since surface areas of organs and mesentaries were not com¬
puted. Thirdly, the information in this paper is probably specific
for the community of Citharichthys sordidus studied, and for the time
of year the study was done.
The parasites of Citharichthys sordidus offer several opportunities
for future work. Some possibilities include: illucidating the life cycle
of Ceratomyxa hopkinsi, determining reasons for the observed helminth
distributions, investigating the life cycle of the trypanorhynchid ces¬
tode, and determining the damaging effects of the various helminths on
