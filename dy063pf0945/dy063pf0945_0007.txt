and the life cycle is complete. Perhaps the sanddab's anasakids are
immature Contracaecum with the sanddab serving as their intermediate
host. Mackenzie and Gibson (1970) reported that Contracaecum aduncum
was present in the flounder Platichthys flesus and in the plaice Pleuro¬
nectes platessa, taken from the coast of England. Contrary to Hyman,
they state that mature Contracaecum were in the digestive tract and lar-
vae were in the visceral cavity.
The infections of trypanorhynchid larvae appear to be dependent on
one another. Figure 4 shows that there is a disproportionately high
number of fish with both few and many trypanorhynchids, implying that the
distribution of larvae within the sanddab population is clumped. As with
the trematodes, clumping is probably due either to clumping of larvae
within the population of the previous intermediate host or to clumping
of the previous host.
The complete life cycle is not known for any marine trypanorhynchid,
according to Hyman (1951). Rays and sharks are known to be definitive
hosts, but it is not known how the larvae get to an intermediate host.
Furthermore, how larvae get into the visceral cavity from inside the di¬
gestive tract is unknown. All trypanorhynchids found, including those
encysted in the stomach wall and those inside the intestine, were encap¬
sulated and could not be using proboscides to bore. Interestingly, the
trypanorhynchids found loose inside the intestine did seem more active
than those in the visceral cavity; movement of the whole body was ob¬
served in the former while the latter were always motionless. Trypano¬
rhynchids in the visceral cavity may have entered a state of torpor.
