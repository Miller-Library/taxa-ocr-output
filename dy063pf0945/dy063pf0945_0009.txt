the host.
SUMMARY
1. Five prevalent parasites were found during an investigation of
26 sanddabs.
2. Ceratomyxa hopkinsi, a myxosporidean, was present in 100% of the
gall bladders examined.
Trematodes of the family Hemiuridae were in the stomach and
esophagus. A greater number were in the anterior stomach than the
posterior.
Nematodes of the family Anisakidae were in the intestine, pyloric
caeca, and visceral cavity. Those in the visceral cavity were
larger than those in the digestive tract.
5. Larval nematodes were in the wall of the intestine and pyloric caeca
in 6 out of 6 examinations.
6. Cestode larvae of the order Trypanorhyncha were present in the
visceral cavity. A concentration was noted in the area of the
spleen and pyloric caeca.
7. Trypanorhynchid larvae do not randomly infect sanddabs; individual
infections depend on one another.
8. Trypanorhynchid larvae can live in an anaerobic environment for at
least 10 days.
