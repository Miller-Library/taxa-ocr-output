glycerol Utilization
Aposymbiotic hosts occur naturally in dark environments.
After seven weeks in darkness, A. elegantissima algae became
degenerate and plasmolyzed and decreased in number by 80%
(Muscatine, 1974a).
A few experiments were run using aposymbiotic A. xanthogrammica.
It was determined from chlorophyll A/protein ratios that the
bleached specimens contained about 50 times fewer zooxanthellae
than the pigmented specimens used in earlier experiments.
Chlorophyll A is directly related to zooxanthellae counts, because
chlorophyll A is one of the diagnostic pigments in zooxanthellae
and not in zoochlorellae (Muscatine, 1974).
Qualitative respirometry demonstrates that glycerol has a
similar effect with symbiotic cell preparations as with apoÂ¬
symbiotic cell preparations. Depletion rates suggest that the
aposymbiotic issue deplete sooner and faster than symbiotictissues,
but more work needs to be done. Work with aposymbiotic A.
elegantissima has not been done to this effect yet.
Little success was obtained using (U-170) glycerol.
Accounting for background counts, only a 10% recovery of the
total spike counts was measured from the wicks of three sarples.
Now it seems obvious that the base saturated wicks could not
absorb from the air C carbonate ions known to be in the liquid
medium. Acid has to be added to drive off the hot carbonate ions
as 0, before recovery counts can be measured.
Experiments need to be done to assess the contribution or
