Glycerol Utilization
would be needed in order for the utilization of glycerol by the
animal tissues to require about 20 ul of 0Â». Experimentation
demonstrated the expected effect of glycerol well (see Graph 2).
More duplicates of this effect are needed. There appears to be a
lag time after the addition of glycerol until the time of utili-
zation. This lag time of about 1-1.5 hours is too long a time
to account for diffusion of the substrate into the cells. A
better hypothesis is that the effect of glycerol may be an inductive
one. One should also note from Graph 2 that not only are the
endogenous rates the same before and after the utilization of
glycerol, but also the percent increase in 0, consumption from the
endogenous rate to the glycerol utilization rate is about 200%.
This figure is the same figure obtained for 96 hour depletion
figure in Table 1.
Graph 2 compares quite closely with a very similar graph
made by Harvie using A. elegantissima. The mean endogenous rate
Harvie obtained for A. elegantissima, depleted 96 hours, was
compared with the mean endogenous rate for A. xanthogrammica,
also depleted 96 hours. The two rates were standardized for
protein and zooxanthellae amounts, the latter evaluated by
chlorophyll A measurements. For A. elegantissima the result
was 3.9 ul 0/hr/mg protein/mg chlorophyll A. For A. xanthogrammice
the result was 4.3 ul 0/hr/mg protein/mg chlorophyll A. These
two figures suggest that these two Anthopleura consume 02 at
nearly the same rate after 96 hours depletion.
