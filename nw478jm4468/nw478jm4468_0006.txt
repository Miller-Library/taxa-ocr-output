Glycerol Utilization
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The study was divided basically into a qualitative and quant-
itative approach. More experimention using final procedures and
techniques is necessary before all of the conclusions in this
paper can be statistically verified.
From first experiments the maximum non-depleted endogenous
rate of 0, consumption was estimated. The amount of protein used
in each Warburg flask had to be diluted down until the O2
consumption rate did not exceed the 0» liquid diffusion rate.
Using 90 ugm of protein a mean rate of 48 ul/hr/mg protein was
obtained. Comparisons were made with whole animal 0 consumption
rate estimates from two sources. One upper fugure for
A. xanthogrammica (symbiotic) is 2 x 10° ul/hr/mg wet wt. at 10'C
(F. Belick, 1968). This estimate was derived from Verduin methods
of respirometry believed to be 80% accurate (J. Verduin, 1963).
Using a 8- 2, wet wt./dry wt.- 5, protein/dry wt.= 0.1 a wet
wt. rate at 10'C can be converted into a protein wt. rate at 25°0.
Using Belick's estimated rate and these experimentally determined
conversions (Q, was assumed to be equal to 2), one obtains a
rate of 3 x 10° ul/mg protein/hr at 25 C. This figure is 60 times
the maximum rate for cell 0» consumption described in this paper.
R. Shaver, using the Warburg, obtained an upper rate of 0.2
ul/hr/mg dry wt. at 10'C. Similar conversions show that cell
consumption is 800 times the whole animal consumption rate. The
discrepancy remains until further work determines whether surface
area availability to 0 is the determing factor in the rate of
