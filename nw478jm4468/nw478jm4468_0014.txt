Glycerol Utilization
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Table 1. Depletion in symbiotic Anthopleura xanthogrammica.
These figures represent the mean of several samples
which were treated with 0.2 ml of I M glycerol.
Depletion in symbiotic Anthopleura xanthogrammica.
Graph I.
The percentage increase in the 0 consumption rate
seen in Table 1 was used as an index for relative
depletion.
Graph 2.
Quantitative addition of glycerol to symbiotic
Anthopleura xanthogrammica after 96 hours depletion.
This is an expanded portion of a graph and does not
contain all of the data points recorded over a 10 hr.
period. Complete utilization of glycerol by the tissues
requires 20 ul of 09. The numbers along the three
segments of each line represent ul/hr/mg protein.
The three lines from bottom to top represent 0.5, 1.0,
and 1.5 ml samples.
