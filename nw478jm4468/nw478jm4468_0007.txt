Glycerol Utilization
respiration or whether the integrity of the tissue is the determin-
ing factor.
The preparation of A. xanthogrammica was observed microscop-
ically to be mostly whole cells 7u in diameter, which were stained
with methylene blue. A diameter measurement of 12u was observed
for zooxanthellae.
The next set of experiments were concerned with the depletion
of cell reserves. The temperature of the bathing medium was
chosen to produce the highest metabolic rate, therefore depletion
rates, without harming the tissues symbiotically (V. Buchsbaum, 1968).
It was suspected that with a lower endogenous rate of consumption
the effect of glycerol addition would be more noticeable. Before
48 hours the endogenous rate was too high to notice the effect
of glycerol addition, and after 96 hours most of the cells were
dead. The percent increase in the rate of 02 consumption after
the addition of 0.2 ml of 1 M glycerol was used as an index of
relative depletion. As seen from Table 1 and Graph 1 the most
rapid depletion occurs between 48 and 72 hours.. This depletion
curve is very similar to one made by Harvie for symbiotic A.
elegantissima. Depletion could have been accelerated if animal
cells were kept in the dark. Throughout most of the experiments
the light was not controlled.
A small enough amount of glycerol was added such that the
previous endogenous rate returned after substrate utilization.
From the balanced equation of the oxidation of glycerol into
COand H,O it was calculated that 0.2 ml of 1.4 x 10- M glycerol
