Glycerol Utilization
MATERIALS AND METHODS
I. Collection and maintenance of specimens
Large symbiotic A. xanthogrammica were collected without
damage from the lower intertidal zone at Point Joe along the 17
Mile Drive, Del Monte Forest, California. Aposymbiotic specimens
were collected from under the cannery in Pacific Grove next to
Hopkins Marine Station in California.
2. Cell preparation, protein and chlorophyll measurements
After four weeks from the time of collection, a longitudinal
section was cut from the animal. The section was then finely scis-
sor minced and suspended with 0.45 micron millipore sea water.
The supernatant, composed of whole cells and mucus, was centrifuged.
The centrifuge supernatant of suspended mucus was discarded.
The centrifuge residue of whole cells was kept. Coarse tissue
from the previous suspension was centrifuged and residues returned
to scissor mincing procedures. This was repeated until final whole
cell residue was of an adequate volume.
Next the residue was washed with the millipore sea water
and centrifuged three times to thoroughly remove particulate
food sources. The cell preparation was then placed in a depletion
bath. A Warburg respirometer was used as a bath set thermostat-
ically at 25° C and allowed to shake with a 1.5 cm stroke length
at a rate of 104 shakes per minute. After various periods of
incubation—- 48, 72, 96 hours, the stock of cells was washed
three times as before in order to remove lysed cell food sources.
