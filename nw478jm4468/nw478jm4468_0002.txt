Glycerol Utiliza
INTRODUCTION
Much of the work to date dealing with symbiotic sea anemones
concerns the role of symbiotic zooxanthellae in Anthopleura
elegantissima. These algae, thought to be locked among the
endodermal cells of the host, grow slowly and produce more photoÂ¬
synthate than they can utilize. Some of the excess can be released
by the algae. Earlier experiments have shown that the zooxanthellae
of A. elegantissima fix +00 in vitro and release 50% of the
fixed 1 to the medium chiefly as (40) glycerol, (17) glucose,
and other organic acids (Muscatine, 1967; Trench, 1971,a,b).
Later experiments have shown that +002 is actually translocated
in vivo from the zooxanthellae to host tissue principally in the
form of animal lipid and protein. Deacylation of the lipid
C) glycerol (von Holt and von Holt, 1968a; Muscatine
yielded (
and Cernichiari, 1969; Trench, 1971a). This symbiotic role is
probably a nutritional one. Symbiotic A. elegantissima, when
starved in the dark, lose weight at a faster rate than controls
starved in light. Algal photosynthate translocation would
therefore seem to offset weight loss in the host (Muscatine, 1961a).
The studies in this paper deal specifically with the effects
of glycerol upon 0 consumption in symbiotic (and aposymbiotic)
A. xanthogrammica. Very little previous work has dealt with the
symbiotic role in this sea anemone. For a first time some effects
of glycerol upon the Og consumption by A. xanthogrammica are
revealed, and a comparison with similar studies on A. elegantissima
are made.
