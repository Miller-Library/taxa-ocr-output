Glycerol Utilization
ABSTRACT
Oxygen respirometry proved to be a useful means of evaluation
for the effects of glycerol on the cells of Anthopleura
xanthogrammica. The utilization of glycerol was demonstrated
both qualitatively and quantitatively. An experiment using
(U-17C) glycerol did not show evidence for direct or inductive
utilization of glycerol. Comparisons made with Anthopleura
elegantissima using data from similar experiments performed by
Harvie indicated that the role of glycerol in both Anthopleura
was similar.
