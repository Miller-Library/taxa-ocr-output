Glycerol Utilization
The final stock was then ready to be used in part for Warburg
respirometry, protein, chlorophyll, and dry weight determinations.
The remaining stock was returned to the depletion bath until the
next period 24 hours later. The Lowry method for protein determin-
ation was used (Lowry, 1951). An acetone extraction of
chlorophyll, followed by centrifugation, and cubette spectro¬
photometry was performed on each cell sample. The milligrams
of chlorophyll'a'present was determined according to procedures
obtained from personal communication with J. Phillips, professor
at Hopkins Marine Station. All quantitative measurements were made
from averages of three duplicates each in turn averaged from five
readings.
3. Warburg Respirometry
Millipored sea water was added to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 ml of cell
preparation to bring all Warburg flasks to a constant volume of
1.5 ml. The flask side arm contained 0.2 ml of 1.4 x 10" M glycerol,
enough to allow for a period of utilization equal to 20 ul of
oxygen. Otherwise the side arm contained 0.2 ml of 1 M glycerol¬
essentially an unlimited amount. The center well contained 0.2 ml
of 208 KOH and a wick. Total volume for each flask was 1.9 ml.
The Warburg was set at the same shake rate and temperature as was
the depletion bath and an air gas phase used. After thermoequil-
ibration, readings were taken at 15 minute intervals for 8 hours
and the rate of oxygen consumption in microliters of 0 per
milligram protein per hour was calculated from the period during
which the rate was constant with time.
