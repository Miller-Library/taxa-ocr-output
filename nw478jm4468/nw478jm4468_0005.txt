Glycerol Utilization
4. Utilization of (U-170) glycerol
Animal cells were depleted for 72 hours in the dark, washed
three times every 24 hours, and 1 ml samples used in the Warburg
flasks. Three duplicates of symbiotic cell preparations were
run with the light intensity kept constant. In order to prove
whether glycerol was directly or inductively used by the
animal cells, 0.2 ml of 1.4 x 10â€” M glycerol in the side arm was
spiked with 2000 DPM of (U-176) glycerol (50uCi of U-1 glycerol
was obtained from Amersham/Searle). A 0.07 ml amount of B-phenyl-
ethylamine, completely wick absorbed, was used as C0 absorbant.
After allowing four hrs. for the utilization of glycerol and return
to the endogenous rate, the wick was removed and placed in a
scintillation vial, aquasol was added, and counts were taken in a
scintillation counter.
5. Cell preparation microscopy
The cell preparation was examined under the microscope
under 450 power.
