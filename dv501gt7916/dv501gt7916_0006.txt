concentration of larger specimens were estimated as 5 ft
for Acmaea scabra, 4 ft. for A. digitalis, 3 ft. for A.
limatula, and 2.5 ft. for A. scutum. Algae growing in the
spective collection areas were: A. scabra, microscopic
lgae only; A. digitalis, microscopic algae, Ralfsia spp.,
and some Peysonnelia spp.; A. limatula, microscopic algae,
Sigartina spp., Endocladia spp., and Pelveti-
Balfsia s
. andA. scutum, microscopic algae, Ralfsia spp.,
Sigartina spp., and Porphyra spp. The microscopic algae ir
this area were varied green and red algae (Haven, 1966).
his is not meant to be a definitive list of the dietary
onstituents of these animals, but rather an observation
of the algae available for food in the limited areas from
which the organisms were collected.
Enzyme activit
In the first experiment, the animals were "starved"
in an aquarium scraped free of algae, and kept in the dark.
After 4-6 days of starving, extracts of the gut were made,
and ensyme activity determined.
The results are recorded
in Table 1.
The results show the presence of a powerful amylase
with higher activity at ph 5.5 in all'species. An alginase
was also demonstrated in all species. All species examined
