An examination of the distribution of the genus
Acmaea in the intertidal revealed that the various species
have their highest population densities in different tidal
zones. One of the characteristics of these zones is a dif-
ference in their algal flora. These various intertidal
algae, which synthesize a variety of polysaccharide mate-
rials (see Peat and Turvey, 1966) constitute a potential
source of food to herbivorous scrapers such as Acmaea.

The assimilation of these materials would require a varie
carbohydrases and led to the present comparative study
of the carbohydrases present in the digestive tracts of
four species of Acmaea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The species chosen for this study were: Acmaea
abra (Could, 1846); A.
igitalis Eschscholtz, 1833; A.
limatula Carpenter, 1864; and A. scutum Eschscholtz, 1833.
Large representatives of these species were collected from
areas of their maximum population density at Pescadero
Point, Monterey County, California.
To remove the digestive tract, the animals were
anaesthetized in isotonic magnesium chloride isotonic with
seawater, and the entire digestive tract along with associ-
ated glands (digestive gland, buccal salivary gland, and
