All tubes, including enzyme and substrate controls, were
layered with toluene as a bactericide, after Galli (1956
At the end of the incubation period enzyme activity
was stopped by sodium hydroxide-zinc sulfate precipitation,
and aliquots were assayed for reducing sugar by a modifica-
tion of Nelson's procedure (1944). This modification was
he substitution of sodium hydroxide for barium hydroxide
prevent precipitation of sulfated oligosacharides
formed during enzymatic hydrolysis of K-carrageenin and
fucoidin. The optical density of the final solution was
measured in a Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeten
using a green filter. Nwo standard glucose solutions,
1509 and 509, were run with each set of assays, and all
readings were evaluated by comparison with a glucose
standard curve. Values represent an average of two deter
minations of total reducing sugar released in the incubation
mixture, and correspond to the activity of 0.1 ml of tissue
xtract. The assay was found to be reproducible within 10
percent. The minimum value considered to be significant in
the tables was taken to be 50 ug.
