Capabilities in Four Species of Acmaea (Mollusca: Gastropoda;
Prosobranchia). The Veliger
The carbohydrate digestion of four limpets, Acmaea scabra,
A. digitalis, A. limatula, and A. scutum was studied. The presence

of a -carrageeninase, andagarase, a laminarinase, a fucoidinase.
an alginase, and an amylase was found in all species. Someohydrase
correlation of available sources of food with enzyme activity
was found. Carbohydrase levels in starved animals were compared
with levels in non-starved animals. A decrease in enzyme
activity during starvation was found, and the amount of this
decrease could be correlated with height in the intertidal, higher
species (A. scabra and A. digitalis) showing less decrease than
lower species (A. limatula and A. scabra). This correlation
might be related to food retention time and to feeding
behavior.-Author.
