retain and digest food more efficiently, as was found, and are
therefore, not as susceptible to the effects of deprivation of
food.
SUMARY
The carbohydrate digestion of four limpets, Acmaea scabra,
A. digitalis, A. limatula, and A. scutum was studied. The
presence of a K-carrageeninase, an agarase, a laminarinase, a
Tucoidinase, an alginase, and an amylase was demonstrated for
fods avaae
all species. Some correlation of with enzyme activity was
found. Carbohydrase levels in starved animals were compared with
levels in non-starved animals. A decrease in enzyme activity
during starvation was found, and the amount of this decrease
could be correlated with height in the intertidal, higher species
(A. scabra and A. digitalis) showing less decrease than lower
species (A. limatula and A. scutum). This correlation might be
and
related to food rotention time feeding behavior.

My sincere thanks to Dr. John H. Phillipps for purified
samples of algal polysaccharides and for his guidance during
the entire study. Many thanks to Dr. David Epel for his great
assistance in preparing this paper. This work was made possible
