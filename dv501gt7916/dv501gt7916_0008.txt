DISCUSSION
Green and red algae, which contain starches, K-carrageenin,
and agar (Peat and Turvey, 1965), are available to all species
of Acmaea studied, and the high recorded amylase activity
correlated well with this. Brown algae, containing alginic acid,
fucoidin, and laminarin (Peat and Turvey, 1965), are available
to all species except A. scabra. Although this correlates well
with the low alginase activity found in A. scabra, it is not
reflected in the laminarinase or fucoidinase activity.
Eaton (1966) has made a careful study of the diet of A. limatula
and A. pelta. A similar study of the other species would be
desireable.
The data on changes in carbohydrase activity due to starÂ¬
vation suggest that the degree of these changes is a function
of height in the intertidal zone, higher species (Acmaea scabra
and A. digitalis) showing loss drop in activity than lower species
(4. limatula and 4. scutum). Two possible reasons for this
difference are food retention time and feeding behavior. In fresh
animals, the lower species oliminated food that was only partly
digested at a much greater rate than the higher species. In
the starved animals, the remains of well-digested food were still
found in the gut of the two higher species, whereas nothing was
found in the gut of the two lower species. This difference in
food retention time correlates well with the changes in enzyme
activity during starvation.
The feeding behavior of tho higher species has also been
found to be more sporadic than that of the lower species. The
lower species, being splashed or under water a greater amount of
the tine than the higher species, are thus able to move and feed
for longer periods of time. Trus the higher species must
