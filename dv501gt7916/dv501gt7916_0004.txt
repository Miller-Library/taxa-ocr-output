esophageal salivary gland) excised and placed in 37 sodium
chloride in an ice bath. An enzyme extract was prepared,
containing 1 part tissue, 8 parts 36 sodium chloride, and 1
part of a saturated solution of ovomucoid (ovomucoid dis-
olved in either 0.1 Macetate buffer, ph 5.5, or 0.1 M Tris
puffer, ph 7.2). This mixture was homogenized in a tissue
grinder and then centrifuged for 30 seconds at half maximum
speed in an International Clinical Centrifuge. Ovomucoid,
prepared by the method of Fredericq and Deutch (1949), was
used as an inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes since initial
experiments indicated low carbohydrase activity, possibly
resulting from degradation of the enzymes by proteolysis.
of ovomucoid permitted detection of higher levels of
anzyme activity, and was therefore used in all reported
periments.
One ul of ensyme extract was incubated with l ml of
polysaccharide solution in 3 ml of buffer. Two buffers
were used, either 0.1 M acetate at pli 5.5,or 0.1 M Tris at
p 7.2. The polysaccharides included in this study were
