could hold normal posture at rest and during swimming. Thus M-cellsare not
necessary for functions of the cerebellum pertaining to these behaviors.
The Senorita proved to be an excellent subject for study of Mauthner
initiated behaviors. Senorita are surprisingly hearty animals; most fish were
able to live 1- 3 hours after the operation. Their brains, large for their body
mass, are easily accessible through their thin skull. Electrophysiological
recordings from freely mobile Senorita using techniques pioneered by Zottoli
(1977) might help to elucidate the role of M-cells in the decision-making
process such as that between the two escape responses, the C-start and the
burrowing.
