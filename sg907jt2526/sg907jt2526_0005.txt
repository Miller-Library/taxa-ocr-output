Used to peel away the bone. A Amm diameter hole was finally made through
which an electrode could be inserted.
Electrophysiological Observations
Conventional methods were used for electrophysiological recordings and for
electrode micromanipulation. M-cell activity was recorded with tungsten
microelectrodes insulated with 0-dope varnish except at the tip. The
recording electrode was first positioned over the center of the cerebellum
slightly off the midline (Eaton, 1981). The trajectory of the electrode was at
Ã  90 angle to the dorsal surface of the cerebellum. Data was recorded on a
digital oscilloscope and photographed with Polaroid film.
Since it was known that the M-cells in goldfish are situated approximately
1.5mm below the medulla oblongata (Zottoli,1978), and we measured the
Senorita cerebellar thickness to be 2.6mm, we predicted that Senorita
M-cells should be approximately 4.Omm below the surface of the cerebellum.
Thus in most experiments for recording M-cell activity, the M-cell was found
by lowering the electrode to a depth of 3-Amm below the surface of the brain
while monitoring responses to antidromic stimulation. A large negative going
extracellular action potential is generated at the M-axon in response to
antidromic stimulation of the spinal cord (Faber and Korn, 1978; Diamond
1971.) (See figure 2 for area of insertion.) Care was taken not to lower the
electrode beyond the region of M-spike focus. Survival of the animal appeared
to be greatly impaired after electrode penetration into these deeper regions
of the medulla.
Antidromic stimuli were delivered to the spinal cord by means of
stainless steel bipolar electrodes made from 25 gauge syringe needles
