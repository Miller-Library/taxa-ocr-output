insulated with nailpolish except at the tip. The negative electrode was
inserted through the tail musclature down to the spinal cord at a location
6-8cm behind the cranium (Diamond 1971). The positive electrode was
positioned just outside the skin.
To ascertain the rate of repetitive stimulation useful for later
experiments, we tested the limits of habituation on a fish that had not
undergone surgery. By delivering a stimulus of 2 volts above threshhold value
at regular intervals, it was determined that the animal quickly habituated to
stimulus rates greater than 1shock per 5 seconds. Application of shocks was
therefore kept at a frequency less than O.1Hz.
RESULTS
Orthodromic Stimulation
Orthodromic depolarizations via a tungsten microelectrode in the medulla
produced the characteristic all-or-nothing tail flip at a sharp threshold.
Closing of both opercula and a slight bobbing of the head accompanied the tail
flip. Reversing the stimulus polarity elicited an obviously different behavior
best described as a twitch of the entire body of undef ined direction.
At an electrode tip depth of 3mm below the surface of the cerebellum, we
varied the stimulus duration and strength for depolarizing pulses to defined
strength-duration relation for threshold activation of what appeared to be the
all-or-none tail flip (Fig. 3). As expected, stronger stimull were necessary
to elicit the behavior as the duration grew shorter. Stimulus strength lower
than 2 volts did not produce a response even when the stimulus was very long.
In general, threshold values were distinct within one experiment at any time
but usually increased as the fish expired.
