be consistent with selective stimulation of the large M-cell in the medulla
and supports the proposal that we are in fact stimulating M-cells to produce
the tail flip.
It has been shown that recordings from the brain concurring with
Mauthner tail flip arise from two different depths. We believe the two early
components measured in the medulla are the result of the asymmetrical
activation of the two M-cells. This is confirmed by their all-or-nothing
character and very short latencies of 1.2 and 1.5ms. The mean spike latency
measured in a similar manner in goldfish is 0.78ms (Eaton 1981.) The
apparent conduction velocity in our experiments was calculated by dividing
the negative spike latency into the distance from the stimulation cathode to
recording electrode. The result, a conduction velocity of 80m/s, agrees well
with published values for the goldfish M-, ranging from 55 (Dorsett, 1980)to
10Oms (Eaton, 1981; Furshpan 1962.) Although the diameter of the M-axon in
Senorita is not yet known, it would appear to be very close to that in goldfish.
Further data which support that these are M-cell initiated spikes comes
from inspection of the relative amplitudes of the two spikes. In Figure 48,
the first of the two early spikes is larger, wheras in Fig 4C the second spike
is very much larger. Since the M-cell axons are known to cross in the medulla
(Diamond, 1971), one would expect stimulation on the one side of the fish to
excite the contralateral M-cell first. In this case of Fig. 4B the recording
electrode in the medulla was positioned to the left of the midline, and
stimulation was on the right-hand side of the fish. Thus, we expect the first
early spike to be the larger of the two, because the electrode is closer to the
left M-cell. Exactly the opposite result is seen( l.e., the second early spike is
larger) in Fig. 4C, when the recording and stimulating electrodes were plac
