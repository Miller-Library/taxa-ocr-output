on the same side of the fish.
Since the slower component can be measured from outside the brain and
essentially disappears once the electrode enters the medulla, we believe that
neurons excited in the cerebellum caused this signal. The slow, i11-defined
time course of the signal suggests the massive recruitment of many
cerebellar neurons firing at slightly different times. In addition, we did not
find any changes in the tail-flip behavior when the cerebellum was
completely removed, but the slow component was no longer recordable. This
lends further evidence to our hypothesis that the third component does
originate from the cerebellum and does not play a necessary role in the M-cell
activated tail flip.
The facts that 1) both M-spikes and the cerebellar discharge appear to
have the same threshold value and 2) there exists a consistant delay between
the two early and third components, may indicate that M-cell activity can
quite directly cause or influence the firing of the cerebellar neurons. We
observed the appearance of the first two spikes without the cerebellar
components only once in our entire study. This recording was made precisely
at threshold in the first two spikes at a depth where both early and late
components were measured in all other instances. The M-cell coupling to
cerebellum discharge would thus appear to be powerful, but still susceptible
to inhibition from other sources.
The exact relationship between the cerebellum and the M-cells is still
unclear. The most recent research, conducted by Bartelmez in 1915, suggested
the cerebellum as a possible source of afferent input to M-cells. Experiments
relating the maintainance equilibrium and M-cells were conducted in
Ambystoma by Detwiler (1947) who showed that animals missing M-cells
