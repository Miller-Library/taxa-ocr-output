INTRODUCTION:
A dramatic and universal behavior pattern seen in teleost fish is the
characteristic "tail flip" escape response. This two phase startle response
consists of a fast body bend, where the fish assumes a"C"-like shape,
followed by a straightening of the tail which can propel the fish a full body
length (Eaton, 1976.) A single pair of cells in the medulla is responsible for
the coordination of spinal motor neurons to produce this behavior. These
cells, called the Mauthner (M-) cells, are the most conspicuous neurons in the
brain. In goldfish, the two main dendrites can measure up to half a
millimeter in length and the large myelinated axon extends down the length of
the spinal cord (Furshpan and Furukawa, 1962.) The M-soma receives input
from afferent neurons in the ear and lateral line. Thus a sudden vibrational
stimulus can activate one of the M-cells and cause the stereotypic body
contraction, resulting in rapid acceleration through the water.
Most behavioral research conducted on Mauthner cells has been directed at
a single behavior, the startle response. Although, the stereotypic escape
behavior has appealed to researchers because of its simplicity and
predictiblity, these responses are generally not all-or-none. Closer
examination of the startle response in fish reveal that the rapid escape
movements can be graded in amplitude (Aljure et al, 1980.) Thus it seems
that the execution of escape movements require some finer control. It is
conceivable that Mauthner cells may be involved in other fast movements
with a directed orientation, such as predatory and feeding behavior.
In hopes of understanding the M-cell in conjunction with activities other
than the tail flip, we have chosen the intertidal wrasse as the subject. The
