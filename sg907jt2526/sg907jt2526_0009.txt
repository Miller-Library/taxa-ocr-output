produced any short latency mauthner-like spikes in the non M-cell region but
elicited a broad peak at 33ms after the shock artifact (fig 7B).
Cnus Pentides and M-cell activity
Preliminary studies were also performed on M-cell involvement with
paralysis of Senorita with a toxin from cone snails. The peptide was injected
within Icm radius of stimulating electrode insertion while delivering
superthreshhold shock to tail at a rate of 6 shocks/minute. Amplitudes of
both the M-cell spikes and cerebellar components decreased until
disappearing. The trunk of the fish became very stiff as if muscles both sides
were completely contracted. Its caudal and dorsal fins were fanned out like
that of a the tail in mid-flip response. It was confirmed that the fish was
partially paralyzed when the released fish could not move its tail but could
flap its pectoral fins. In another experiment where less than the required
dosage to paralyzed was injected, the fish was seen to twitch convulsively
in frregular sessions while electrophysiological data is presently being
analysed.
DISCUSSION
Observations of behavior induced by anti- and orthodromic stimulations,
and electrophysiological data have shown we located and recorded from the
Mauthner cell. Data from cranial recordings support the hypothesis of direct
influence by M-cells on neurons in the cerebellum.
In the best preparations of Senorita which were studied, behaviors
produced by anti- and orthodromic stimulations of the medulla are in
agreement with those expected to be produced by excitation of the Mauthner
