Antidromic Stimulation
Stimulation at the spinal cord with a bipolar electrode produced
contraction of tail muscles ipsilateral to the stimulus. In addition, the
stimulus also caused simultaneous closing of both opercula. Both behaviors
appeared to be similar to those produced by orthodromic stimulation.
Stimulus strength necessary to produce antidromic responses varied from as
low as 1.5V at a duration of O.06ms to as much as 40 volts depending on the
condition of the fish and the location of the electrode. Reversing the
stimulus polarity (i.e. making the internal electrode positive) gave rise to a
tail bob in the vertical direction and, at a higher voltages, caused the tail to
curve in the opposite direction. Depending on the extent that experimentation
worsened the health of the animal, the tail flip varied from strong, sweeping
motions to only slight flicks. Although the behavior were not as well defined
as those following orthodromic stimulation, both probably involve M-cells as
supported by results below.
Electrophysiological recordings made in a region dorsal to the M-cells
typically reveal two fast negative spikes and one broader wave, 1.5ms in
duration (Fig 44). As measured from the start of the shock artifact to the
beginning of the initial positivity, the latencies were very short,
approximately 1.2, 1.6 and 3.Oms (Fig. 4B). The two early components begin to
appear at a depth of 1.5-2.Omm below the surface of the brain and their
amplitudes increased with depth. From the last trace in figure 4C, we see
that the one of the early components focuses to a large spike of 0.6V at a
depth of 4.8 where the electrode is now in the medulla. The late potential
change occuring at 3.Oms can be measured from the within the cranial cavity
