uncoordinated activity. We show that our setup was adequate in measuring
M-cell activity as a response to toxin injection, though further study is
needed to clarify the effects.

Preparation of fish and operation procedure
Experiments were performed on adult Senorita (15.5-18)cm in length, Fish
were kept in fresh sea water at 14 C, and fed chopped squid. Fish were
anesthetized by a 5-10 minute imersion in sea water containing 0.0052
quinaldine and .028 isopropyl alcohol. Anesthetized fish were first wrapped
in gauze to reduce slipping from mucous and were then secured by means of
adjustable, plastic cable ties to a plexiglass platform fitted to a small tank.
The mounted fish was placed in the experimental tank and, the head of the
fish was immobilized by fixing the mouth over a disposable pipette tip.
Cooled (14 C) and oxygenated bath solution was perfused at rate of
10Oml/min through the pipette tip during the entire experiment. The body was
kept completely submerged at all times in a solution of 50% seawater and
50% deionized water which served as a simple and satisfactory saline
solution. The water pump circulating the bath solution was powered by a
12V DC battery to avoid 60 cycle noise (Fig. 1).
Ã„fter lowering the water level to expose the skull, a small amount of local
anesthetic (1.52 Dibucane) was applied to the area with cotton swab before
incision. A 1.Ox0.5 cm section of skin was removed from a central area
approximately 1 cm posterior to line drawn between the fish's pupils (Fig .2).
Muscle and connective tissues were scraped away to reveal the cranial ridge.
Using a scalpel, a small slot was made through the skull and forceps were
