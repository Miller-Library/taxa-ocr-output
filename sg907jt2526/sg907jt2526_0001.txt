ABSTRACT:
Extracellular recordings of Mauthner (M-) cell activity was carried out in the
Senorita wrasse, Ovyjulis californica Criteria for identifying the Mauthner
cell have been satisfied in our experimentation. We observed a C-start tail
flip behavior caused by both antidromic and orthodromic stimulation.
Electrophysiological recordings from the medullary area thought to contain
the M-cells reveal a short-latency, all-or-nothing spike of large amplitude.
Preliminary experiments on the effects of an as yet uncharacterized cone
snail toxin on M-cell activity were performed.
