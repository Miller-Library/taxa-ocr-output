above the brain and increases as the electrode enters the cerebellum.
However, as the electrode is lowered to the medulla, this late component
disappears. In sum, the two early spikes seem to originate from the medulla
while the slowest spike appears to originate from the cerebellum.
The two early spikes and later single component vary differently as a
function of voltage. Two separate experiments, figure 5A and 5B, confirm
that both sets of spikes appear to have the same threshhold value (4.0 and
4.2V respectively). Once breaching that value, it is clear that the amplitude of
the two early spikes do not increase with stimulus strength while the late
one does. Thus it can be said that the two early spikes bear an all-or-nothing
relationship with strength of the stimulus, and the single later component
can be graded with voltage.
To assess the level of background "cranial noise," the recording electrode
was inserted in a location believed to be distant from the Mauthner location.
In this experiment, the M-spike was first located by methods described above.
Then the electrode was placed 1.3mm anterior and approximately 0.75mm to
the right of the location of the M-spike, and lowered to a depth of 3.Smm.
Medullary recordings in this region show no spikes corresponding to any of
the three responses measured in the M-cell region nor any brief latency
responses. On a slower time base, it is apparent that electrodes in the
non-M-cell region recorded spontaneous and stimulated brain activity not
seen in the M-cell regions (Figs 6B1,B2,B3.)
In addition to spinal cord electrical stimulation, a strobe light flash was
used to trigger a startle response and action potentials in the M-cell were
measured from the same two regions. The trace from the M-cell region (fig
7A) shows only one spike at a latency of 1.Oms. The same stimulus failed to
