when it senses danger, an extraordinary burrowing behavior as well a more
typical tail-flip response. It appears to use the same set of muscles for both
escape responses. Presumably, the tail-flip response is, as in other teleosts,
controlled by the M-cells. How then are the Mauthner cells involved in escape
burrowing and in the process of deciding between the two behaviors?
The following paper seeks to explore the above questions by first
developing a workable method to record electrophysiologic behavior from the
Senorita. We show by satisfying four criteria that we have indeed recorded
from the Mauthner cell. First, we demonstrated that antidromic and
orthodromic stimulations produce a c-start tail flip. Secondly, we have
measured large, single-unit spikes in an area of the medulla corresponding to
that where M-cells are located in goldfish. Third, the very short latency of
these responses are similar to those known to accompany antidromic
conduction along the large M-cell axons. Finally, we see that these short
latency responses are act ivated with the lowest threshold observed and bear
an all-or-nothing relationship to the strength of stimulus (Furshpan and
Furukawa, 1962.)
Our setup was applied to preliminary analysis of the effects of cone snail
toxins. The toxin used in this study is a peptide abstracted from Conus snails
of the Philippines that prey on fish. This as yet uncharacterized toxin is
thought to be the single component that allows snails to paralyze their prey
within seconds, but its mode of action has not been defined. (Olivera,
personal communication.) Given the speed of its effectiveness, it was
hypothesized that this "paralytic toxin" sends a train of rapidly firing action
potentials to the M-cells. The M-cells could then stimulate the contraction of
tail muscles on both sides thereby paralyzing the prey in a seizure of
