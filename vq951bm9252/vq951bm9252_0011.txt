developmental rates. Clearly, further studies with data from larger egg
masses needs to be obtained.
If it is the case that egg masses have a high variability of
developmental stages then it would be difficult to place regulations on
squid fishing times based on the stage of development at which egg masses
are reported (by divers or incidental catch observations).
Based on physical properties of the lampara net's chains and the
purse-seine's lead line, the comparative level of damage would fall between
the D and Dl levels of damage of the lab study described above, It is
unlikely that the level of net damage would fall in the range of levels D2
D3. This would indicate that the optimum time for fishing would be in an
area with an egg mass that is known to be at T-O or LS, and restrictions
could productively apply to the period at which the egg mass was at its MS
in development. Because such a non-variation situation seems highly
unlikely, such a regulation would be impossible to use,
The squid boat observation, afforded some information information
about the half-purse seine net. The incidental catch consisted of pelagic
organisms and lacked squid egg cases. Further observations by the Calif,
Dept. of Fish and Game will support or refute this single observation and
will be the basis of the decision of whether or not to use half-purse
seines in the Monterey Bay squid fleet. While setting time for this type of
net is less than the lampara and thus spends less time on the bottom,
further studies, involving SCUBA and/or under-water video technology will
be essential to determine what is actually occurring at the bottom and on
the egg masses themselves,
CONCLUSIONS
Future studies on market squid eggs may benefit from the regression
