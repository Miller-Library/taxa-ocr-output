were counted for number of embryos; mean L - 48.82 mm and the mean n - 82.
Number is dependent upon length because the slope of the regression line (b
- 2.0962) is significantly different from zero
(ts - 3.883, P « .01).
For estimates of y - bx + a, a - -19.8536.
Figure 7. Linear Regression Analysis for Late Stage eggs. 42 egg cases
were counted for number of embryos; mean L - 48.82 mm and mean n - 89.
Number is dependent upon length because the slope of the regression line (b
- 1.26318) is significantly different from zero
(ts - 9.81, P « .001).
For estimates of y - bx + a, a - .312621.
Figure 8. Damage of Time-Zero eggs. Estimated Percentage of Mortality
(EPM) is given for five levels of damage (Control, D, D1, D2 and D3), Cross
hatchings show s.d. (if « 5 then s.d. is not shown). Significant increases
in EPM were observed in Dl and D3 groups (Us = 16) compared to the control
group.
Figure 9. Damage of Mid-Stage eggs. EPM is given for five levels of
damage (Control, D, D1, D2 and D3). Cross hatchings show s.d.. All groups
are above 408 EPM and egg cases receiving 2.1 kg of weight (D2) showed a
significant decrease in EPM (Us - 16) compared to the control group. Notice
that Control and D groups had EPM's » 753.
Figure 10. Damage of Late-Stage eggs. EPM is given for five levels of
damage (Control, D, D1, D2 and D3). Cross hatchings show s.d. (if § 5 it is
not shown). All groups with egg cases receiving upper levels of damage (D1.
D2 and D3) showed a significant increase in EPM (Us - 25) compared to the
control group.
