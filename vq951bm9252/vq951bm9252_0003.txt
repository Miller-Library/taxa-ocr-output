al. 1979). During their planktonic lives, they are swept to deeper waters
via currents and grow rapidly until they reach a mature size in 1-2 years
(Spratt 1979). Near the end of its life cycle, the market squid returns to
the Bay (or other sheltered areas running along the Pacific coast line) to
spawn and then die soon after. Spawning squid can be found in Monterey Bay
from April to November and peak during summer months,
During the spawning season, females deposit egg cases into large
aggregated egg masses that are usually attached to the sandy bottom. These
egg masses can be nearly an acre in area (Okutani and McGowan 1969) and 1.3
meters in height above the bottom (Fields 1965)
Market squid are obligate schoolers and they prefer shallow waters for
spawning (Fields 1965). These characteristics make them ideal for
commercial fishing. Monterey Squid Fishery
The current squid boat fleet of Monterey Bay's squid fishery utilizes
lampara nets, introduced to the fishery in 1905 by Italian fishermen,
Originally, these nets lacked lead lines and were operated by hand. They
were eventually pulled aboard with large drums and lead weights were often
strung along anchor lines to increase sinking time. As the anchoring line
sinks it causes the net to take a U-shaped configuration with two
enveloping wings:
By 1980, lampara nets began using lead chains to increase the sinking
speed of the net. When the net is pulled aboard, this chain is dragged
along the bottom. Although it has been assumed that these chains simply
bounce over egg masses that may be underneath the schooling squid, tons of
squid eggs have been pulled up in the net as part of incidental catches
(Hardwick, pers. comm., 1987). It is also possible that egg masses or parts
of them are being pulled up from the substrate by these chains. This would
