with increasing weight. Mid-Stage eggs are significantly higher than
Control, D, Dl and D2 groups of Time-Zero egg cases,
(Us - 16 for C, D
and D1; Us - 19 for D2).
Figure 12. Damage comparison between Time-Zero and Late-Stage eggs:
EPM with increasing weight. Only one significant difference occurred; at
2.1 kg of weight (D2) Late-Stage eggs had a significantly higher EPM (Us -
25)
Figure 13. Damage comparison between Mid-Stage and Late-Stage eggs.
Mid-Stage eggs have significantly higher EPM's for Control, D and DI groups
(Us = 20).
