Cystoseina. Cluster No. 3 was found resting on the ocean floor,
unattached to any substrate. It contained 259 egg cases that were
visibly in two different stages of development. 123 of them were T-O
and 136 were brownish, LS egg cases. This represents a 2-3 week
difference in developmental stages.
One observation was made on May 19, 1987, aboard the EL DORADO.
one of the two squid boats in the Monterey fleet that had an
experimental half-purse seine net. A single netting was made in the morning
just beyond the Cannery Row kelp beds at an approximate depth of 100 feet.

and 108 sardines. The incidental catch consisted of approximately 20 Barrel
Salps (Thetys Vagina) and 5 electric rays. One small clump of mud and sea
plant was pulled aboard but no squid eggs were observed. The other squid
boats in the fleet were also unsuccessful in netting a marketable amount of
squid.
DISCUSSION
The numbers of embryos per egg case reported from previous studies
(Fields 1965, Okutani & McGowan 1969) were larger than the mean number per
egg case (104) obtained in the present study. Fields described his method
as "counting the eggs in a measured part (of the casel and then estimating
the total content." When this method was tested at the onset of the present
study overestimates were obtained. Counting the embryos directly seems to
be the most accurate method, yet it was very time consuming and would be
impractical in a field study,
Regression lines obtained from data in the current study may be of use
to future studies on market squid eggs because they allow a reasonable
