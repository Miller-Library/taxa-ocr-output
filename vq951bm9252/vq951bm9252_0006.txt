contained embryos with colorless organs (arms, eyes, mantle). LATE-STAGE
egg cases contained embryos that resembled hatchlings with yolk sacs
extending just past their arms. These egg cases were 24-28 days old and
within a week of hatching.
Once counted and damaged, TIME-ZERO, MID and LATE STAGE groups (n = 4
to 5 egg cases/group) were incubated at 15-16Â° C (to decrease hatching
latency) in aerated sea water that was changed every 2-3 days. The volume
of sea water per egg case was 250 ml.
An estimated percentage of mortality was obtained by dividing the
number dead after damage by the original number of embryos per egg case,
TIME-ZERO and MID-STAGE egg cases were assessed 1-2 weeks after damage,
while LATE-STAGE mortality was determined by counting the number of viable
hatchlings and obtaining the number dead via subtraction. Embryos were
counted as dead if they were 1) visibly dead, 2) fertilized yet
undeveloped,3) misdeveloped, or 4) hatched prematurely,
Estimated percentage of mortality of damage level groups D, D1, D2,
and D3 were compared to control groups for each stage. The Mann-Whitney U.
test was used for statistical analysis.
RESULT
Lab Study
The number of embryos per egg case ranged from 14-220 with a mean of
104 for the 100 egg cases counted. There were 37 Time-Zero (T-O) egg cases
with mean length (L) - 45.08 mm and mean number of embryos (n) - 142, 21
Mid-Stage (MS) egg cases with mean L - 48.82 mm and mean n = 82, and 42
Late-Stage (LS) egg cases with mean L - 70.47 mm and mean n = 89. Length
measured the portion of the egg case that contained embryos. Of the 100
cases counted, 21 were used for T-O, 20 for MS, and 25 for LS groups that
