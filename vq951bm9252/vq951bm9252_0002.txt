that the converse may be true, yet there are no physical explanations for
these phenomena.
The past two years have been especially difficult for the squid
fishery. Low demand for market squid has made it difficult to maintain the
8-10 person crew needed for the lampara net (Figures 1, 2) and the rising
concern about the chain's effect on the egg masses has resulted in the
issuing of two experimental permits for the use of half-purse seine nets
(Figure 3). These purse seines have nylon encased lead-lines so that the
only metal in the net is the rings that guide the purse line (Figure 4)
Life History of the Squid
Eggs of the market squid (Loligo opalescens) have a developmental
period of 3-5 weeks depending upon temperature. Fields (1965) reported that
embryonic development takes 3-4 weeks in aquaria at approximately 16 Â°C.
while McGowan (1954) incubated eggs at an average temperature of 13.6 %
and found that they hatched in 30-35 days
During this incubation period embryos reside in gelatinous egg cases,
the jelly-like matrix of which deters most predators. As the chorions of
individual embryos expand through development, the case and its tunic
layers expand and by the time of later stages, the egg case is
approximately five times larger in volume than it was at time of deposition
(Fields 1965)
If late stage embryos are forced to hatch prematurely, they are able
to swim (with the yolk sac extending from their arms), but these premature
hatchlings have an increased chance of early mortality (Boeletsky & Hanlon
1983). Hatchlings must learn how to eat within the 2-4 days before their
internal yolk supply is depleted. Once they learn how to eat, hatchlings
will prey upon other planktonic organisms such as larval fish (Hanlon et,
