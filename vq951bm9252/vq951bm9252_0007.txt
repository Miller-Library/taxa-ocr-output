were damaged.
For each stage in development the number of embryos per egg case is
dependent upon the length. Figures 5, 6 and 7 depict the linear regression
lines for T-O, MS and LS egg cases respectively. By using an un-paired t.
test to determine significance of the regression lines, it is clear that
the number of embryos per egg case is positively correlated with length for
each stage.
Damaged egg cases from T-O and LS groups experienced an
increase in estimated percentage mortality (EPM) with increasing weight
(Figures 8, 10), while MS egg cases had a relatively high EPM throughout
all five levels of damage (Figure 9). T-O and LS groups from damage levels
DI, D3 and Dl, D2, D3 respectively showed a significant increase in EPM.
while control and Dl groups were nearly 1008 viable. T-O and LS groups had
similar EPM's (Figure 8), but differed dramatically from MS eggs,
especially in the lower levels of damage (control, D, and D1) (Figures 7.
9).
Field Study
Three clusters of egg cases were collected from Monterey Bay via
SCUBA. They were located off Wharf No. 2 at a depth of 20-25 feet.
Cluster No. 1 had approximately 200 egg cases that were mainly in later
stages of development or otherwise completely hatched and deteriorating
In a laboratory aquarium of running sea water (11-13 C) hatchlings were
observed from this cluster three days after they were collected and for
the subsequent 18 day period (hatchlings were removed weekly to
determine total hatching period). Cluster No. 2 had 163 egg cases that
were at the T-O stage in development when collected. They did.
however, differ 2-4 days in developmental stages (water temperature
approx. 12 C). Clusters 1 and 2 were both attached to the sea weed
