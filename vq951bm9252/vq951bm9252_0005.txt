MATERIALS AND METHODS
Egg cases were obtained from laboratory aquaria containing spawning
market squid (Loligo Opalescens) and from Monterey Bay via SCUBA. The egg
cases from the Bay were collected as clusters from a depth of 20-25 ft. off
Wharf #2.
A direct count of embryos per egg case was obtained with the aid of a
dissecting microscope. Light passed through each case from below allowed
adequate visibility of individual embryos,
Egg cases were damaged individually by rolling a cylinder of varying
weight along their length. The cylinder, a hollow section of
polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe (length (L) - 250 mm, diameter (D) - 48 mm.
weight (W) -.21 kg) accommodated up to three 2 1b. (0.94 kg) dive weights,
This afforded four increasing levels of damage: zero (control), cylinder
only (D), cylinder plus .94 kg (D1), cylinder plus 1.88 kg (D2), and
cylinder plus 2.79 kg (D3).
Inflicting damage upon an individual egg case required 1) keeping the
egg case immobilized by covering/securing it with a fine mesh, 2) running
sea water (enough only to keep the egg case from desiccating or sticking to
the mesh), and 3) an inclined surface that allowed consistent rolling of
the cylinder. The inclined surface was provided by a block of styrofoam (L
- 1035 mm, width - 250 mm, height - 50 mm), with one end resting upon a
small section of PVC pipe (D - 33.65 mm). The cylinder accelerated down the
4.4° - 5° incline where it reached the stalk end of the egg case
approximately 450 mm from the starting point,
Egg cases were damaged at three different stages in development: TIME¬
ZERO, MID-STAGE, and LATE-STAGE. TIME-ZERO egg cases were up to 10 days old
(at 11-12 °0) and characterized by a lack of organ development at the
animal pole of the egg. MID-STAGE egg cases were 13-16 days old and
