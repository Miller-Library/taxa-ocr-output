EIGURE LEGEND
Figure 1. Side view of a squid boat using its lampara net. The chain
is shown at the bottom; its purpose is to sink the net quickly, The cork
line rests on top of the water and allows the net to span the depth of
water. The drum at the stern of the squid boat pulls the net in. Lampara
nets require an 8-10 person crew.
Figure 2. Top view of the lampara net, showing the wings that come
together to form a pocket when the net is drawn in. Throughout this slow
and steady process, the lead chain drags the bottom,

the bottom of this net closes up like a satchel and all of its metal rings
coming together.
Figure 4. Top view of half-purse seine, showing purse line, metal
rings and lead line. While traditional purse seines have lead-lines made of
steel cables, the modified half-purse seine (experimental gear net) has a
lead-line that is encased in nylon. This may reduce damage to egg masses
compared to the chains of the lampara. Half-purse seines require a 3-4
person crew.
Figure 5. Linear Regression Analysis of Time-Zero eggs. 37 egg cases
were counted for number of embryos; mean L - 45.08 mm and mean n - 142.
Number is dependent on length because the slope of the regression line (b -
3.323708) is significantly different from zero (ts - 8.23, P ยง ,001), For
estimates of y - bx +a, a = -8.2561.
