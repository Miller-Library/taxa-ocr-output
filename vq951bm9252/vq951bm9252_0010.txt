egg cases that had tunic layers removed as a result of damage, which may
have increased the amount of aeration received by the embryos and resulted
in an insignificant increase in EPM at this level of damage. Tunic layers
of DI egg cases remained intact, but often bunched up, which may have
decreased aeration at these areas of the egg case where a large percentage
of the dead embyros were observed. Tunic Layers of D3 egg cases were
removed leaving the embyros exposed, yet this high level of damage may have
surpassed the physical limitations of the chorion sacs and resulted in the
significant increase in EPM,
LS eggs also showed an increase in EPM with increasing weight of the
cylinder, yet the mortality of these egg cases was due mainly to the
occurrence of premature hatchlings. Embryos that were not physically
squeezed out or hatched prematurely nearly all went on to hatch normally,
Egg cases from Control and D groups were also nearly 1008 viable. This
suggests that, while sensitive to damage as demonstrated by the occurrence
of pre-mature hatchlings, these egg cases contain embryos that have
developed beyond the proposed time of critical damage,
Data obtained from the three egg clusters from the field study
suggests that egg clusters and possibly larger egg masses contain egg cases
at varying stages in development. Possible explanations for this phenomena
are: I) egg clusters are not created all at once. This notion is supported
by the results of experiments in which real or artificial egg clusters
placed in laboratory aquaria containing market squid acted as a stimulus
for spawning (Hurley, 1977). 2) egg clusters contain egg cases that develor
at different rates. This may occur because egg cases experience varying
levels of exposure to sea water depending upon the amount of crowding or
covering by other cases. 3) a combination of varying deposition times and
