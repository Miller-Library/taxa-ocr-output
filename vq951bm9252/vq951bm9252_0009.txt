estimate of the number of embryos per egg case from the length. For T-O, MS
and LSs in development, the number per case is dependent upon length,
Critical to the regression lines is the separation of the three stages
because they have different number/volume ratios. For example, LS egg cases
are inherently larger than T-O eggs and thus have a smaller number/volume
ratio.
Results from the present study suggest that MS egg cases are more
sensitive to trauma than T-O or LS egg cases. The relatively high EPM
values of 81.753 and 75.388 obtained from Control and D MS groups (lowest
levels of damage) were due to the trauma elements involved in counting
(temperature change, stress of handling), that did not effect T-O or LS
eggs. Egg cases used in MS and T-O groups were from the same cluster and
eggs from this batch that were not counted went on to hatch normally, This
suggests that they were not from a cluster of egg cases that had a pre-
determined high level of mortality,
MS egg cases thus seem to contain embryos at a critical point in
development. When perturbed at this stage in development, there is an 8-
fold increase in EPM. The relatively high EPM values for the lower damage
groups and the highest occurrence of misdeveloped embyros support this
hypothesis. Misdeveloped eggs were characterized by the extraneous tissue
(1-3 mm in radius) that surrounded the eye and optic lobe regions of the
embryo and by other obvious, yet less frequent anomalies (i.e.,
insufficient mantle growth).
1-O eggs had a much smaller occurrence of misdeveloped embyros and
appeared to be at a stage in development preceding the critical point that
the MS range includes. Increasing weight of the cylinder seemed to be the
sole cause of the increase in EPM for these egg cases; significant
increases of EPM occurred in Dl and D3 damage groups. The D2 group included
