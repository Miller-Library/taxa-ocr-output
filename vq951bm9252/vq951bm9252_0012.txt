lines obtained incidentally from the data of this study. Reasonable
estimates can be made, for T-O, MS and LS egg cases, by measuring length
(x-value) and using the equation of a line (y-bxta) to obtain the number of
embryos.
MS egg cases appear to be more sensitive than T-O or LS egg cases, It
is hypothesized that egg cases in this range of developmental growth are at
a critical/vulnerable stage.
Although a change in the squid fishing industry's use of nets may be
eminent, further studies are needed to support or refute the small sample¬
size observations of the field aspect of this study. The issue of squid
landing variability remains a complicated one. Even if the half-purse seine
becomes accepted by the squid boat association and Fish & Game as less
detrimental than the lampara net, there may be additional or unknown
factors contributing to this dilemma that the industry currently faces
ACKNOWLEDGMEN
Warm thanks to my T.A. and dive buddy Carol Marzuola and to my
advisors Chuck Baxter and William Gilly. Thanks also to Mark Denny for
extensively proof-reading the paper. Special thanks to developmental
specialists Tasha Fraley and Bruce "Del Monte Beach" Hopkins and to Steve
Kernie and Tom Otis for their patience on my third Monterey Wharf dive, The
field study was made possible largely because of the help I received from
Jim Hardwick of the California Department of Fish and Game in meeting the
squid fishermen. I would also like to thank Vince Aliotti and the crew of
his boat The El Dorado for their cooperation during my squid boat
observations. Extremely warm thanks to my classmates of BIO 175H for a
memorable spring quarter "under seas.'
