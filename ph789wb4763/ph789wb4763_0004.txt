association, and behavior. In order to accurately count all of the
golden-eye in an annotated frame adjacent frames were also examined.
The single frames were recorded on optical disk for easier access and
review at later times in the study.
An estimation of the area captured in a given videotape frame was
calculated setting the length of a sharply focused golden-eye in the frame
equal to the average length based on specimens in hand. This conversion
factor was used in transforming dimensions on the monitor to natural
dimensions. The calculated area was then used to compute golden-eye
density (Harea) for a standardized 25X25 centimeter quadrat.
investigated the relationship of density to habitat type by first
classifying notes on habitat into three categories and then comparing them
with calculated average densities for each frame. The three types of
habitat were classified as follows:
1. Hard substrate- on or within approximately one meter of a
hard, vertical rock wall face
2. Rubble- mixture of soft detritus or sandy sediment and low
lying rocks
3. Soft sediment- detritus or sandy sediment with no large rocks
within one meter
