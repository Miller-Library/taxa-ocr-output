Specimens were collected May 7, 1990 and May 23,1990 at the Canyon Wall
C4-C5 site using the suction sampler mounted on the ROV. The May 7th
dive yielded only one golden-eye from a depth of 370 meters. It was kept
in cold sea water for transport to the Monterey Bay Aqurium, where it was
put in a holding container with circulated water maintained between five
and seven degrees Celsius. The container was then placed in a darkened
room, and we observed the specimen for ten days before it died. It was
then fixed in sea water and10% Formalin, and stored in 70% alcohol. On
the May 23rd dive approximately 30 specimens were collected from a
depth of 340 meters and transported in cold sea-water to an aquarium
holding tank. Six died in the transit and were fixed and preserved in the
same fashion as the one above. These seven organisms were observed
under a dissecting scope, and using a calibrated ocular micrometer, total
body length was measured from the anterior margin of the carapace to the
posterior end of the telson, excluding spines or setae. Illustrations were
drawn using a camera lucida.
The surviving 25 specimens continue to be kept in a cold-water
holding tank. Observations of their behavior have been noted. They are
