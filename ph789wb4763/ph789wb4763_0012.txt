vertical faces is that their methods of feeding favor a softer sediment
habitat. They exhibit two types of feeding: filtration of suspended food
material, and ingestion of large food masses (Crouau 1989). It seems
likely that since filter-feeding is a major means of gathering food that
this activity would be favored in a softer material, because it would be
easier to generate a hydrodynamic current with lighter and less attached
organic material. Additional support for a preference for soft sediment is
the relatively fragile structure of the golden-eye exoskeleton. Normally
benthic mysids have a more robust exoskeleton which protects them it
they go burrowing for food in coarse sediment (personal communication
with Dr. Peter Slattery). The lighter exoskeleton of the golden-eye
suggests that it is not a burrower, and this is corroborated by video and
laboratory observation. Finally, when dives were conducted at the C4-C5
site to collect golden-eye, the golden-eyes were most often found on
plateaus where softer detritus matter was present or near crevices where
rock and soft bottom met.
The great numbers and close proximity of golden-eye to a variety of
organisms and substrate types suggest they may be scavengers or involved
