the hyperbenthic zone on numerous dives. They were thought to be mysids,
but as none were in hand to identify them, they were labeled temporarily
as "golden-eyes". Limitations in our knowledge of mysid taxonomy,
ecology and physiology as noted by Krygier and Murano (1988), coupled
with the ubiquitous nature of golden-eyes, make them animals worthy of
study. Additionally, the ROV provides a rare opportunity to view these
animals in their natural environment, and to get live specimens from the
deep ocean. The purpose of my study was to determine an exact taxonomic
label for the mysid and to better understand how they fit into the benthic
microenvironments they inhabit.
An analysis of "golden-eye" distribution by depth and habitat was
done by reviewing videotapes taken during ROV dives. In addition,
specimens were collected using a suction sampler mounted on the RÃ–V and
observed in holding tanks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium where they
continue to live. Those animals which did not survive the transfer to
holding tanks in the aquarium were preserved for use in taxonomic studies.
