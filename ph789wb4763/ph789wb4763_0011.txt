C4-C5 site may relate to the patchiness and diversity of suitable habitat
types at that location. The C4-C5 site is characterized by hard, vertical
wall faces, and very rugged, rocky terrain, with patches of rubble, and soft
sediment slopes of variable size. There is also an abundance of detrital
material settled on the non vertical substrate. Golden-eye were often
found swimming at the base of rocky, vertical wall faces, or in and out of
rock crevices. The data show that the greatest densities were near soft
sediment, where detrital accumulation is favored. The high degree of
habitat diversity at the C4-C5 site with many suitable habitat types may
legislate against a dominance by predators which may be distributed at a
different patch scale. The expanded range of the ROV will again be helpful
in investigating the habitat available with increased depth. It will be
interesting to see if the trend of decreased available hard, rock substrate
and substrate relief with increasing depth affects golden-eye distribution
as such conditions have previously been shown to affect hard substrate
communities (Lissner 1989).
Another possible explanation for the low density of golden-eye on hard,
