When examining one specimen in a dish under a dissecting scope it
began to do something best described as a headstand. Mauchline described
this type of behavior as a modification of the general filter feeding
method. The thoracic exopods are used to generate a water current
capable of moving surface material to the feeding appendages for
filtration from the water (Mauchline 1980). The golden-eye appeared to
have no problems maintaining its orientation from the dish sides, and the
use of the antennal flagellum for this purpose was evident. It also did an
extensive picking process through particles and smaller organisms in the
dish and rapidly discarded most of them posteriorly by a sweeping motion
of the thoracopod endopods.
Discussion
The inability to classify the organism beyond the subfamily level not only
reflects the possibility that it is an undescribed species, but also points
out some of the difficulties encountered in mysid taxonomy. I primarily
used Tattersall (1951), Mauchline (1980), and Kathman's et. al (1986) in
