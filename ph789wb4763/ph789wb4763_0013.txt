in commensal relationships. This would make a great deal of sense, since
mysid diets are generalized and include a great variety of organic
materials (Mauchline, 1980). More detailed studies of exactly what the
golden-eye are feeding on and further investigations of their interactions
with other organisms are needed and may tell us more about their role in
the benthic environment.
