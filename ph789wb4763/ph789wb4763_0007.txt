uropod are setose all around, and there is a statocyst on the endopod. The
telson is cleft, and has short spines which begin at about two-thirds of
the total length of the distal margins and run posteriorly through the cleft
region. The pleopods appear uniramous, but ambiguity in the
characterization of uniramity and biramity make it difficult to assess this
trait with confidence.
The analysis of average density by depth in 10 meter intervals for all
of the sites showed the five highest average densities were contained in
the 350 to 390 meter range. The highest average density was 15.1
golden-eye per 625 square centimeter quadrat in the 320 to 330 meter
range. However, this was based on only one frame (Fig. 3). The C4-C5 site
had the highest average density of the five sites with 8.97 golden-eye per
625 square centimeter quadrat. (Fig. 4) Average densities for the three
different habitat types revealed the highest density above soft sediment
(8.01 golden-eye per 625 square centimeters) and the lowest density
above hard substrate (5.89 golden-eye per 625 square centimeters) (Fig.5).
The following is a list of some of the organisms seen in areas with
golden-eye:
