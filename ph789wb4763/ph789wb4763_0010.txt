my efforts to key out the organism, and found that all three of these
references lacked too many definitive characteristics at important
junctures to confidently carry the golden-eye through the key. Mauchline
points out that the incomplete collection of mysids, especially male
species, has created problems with classification. There is a real need for
a comprehensive and updated taxonomic review of the Mysidacea with a
sound key and illustrations of all known species.
It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the data of average
density according to depth due to a lack of sampling at certain depths.
However, the depth range of the mysid appears to start on the shelf break
below two hundred meters. It should also be noted that in a recent dive
golden-eye were found at 450 meters in fairly high densities. The
extension of the RÃ–V depth range to one thousand meters in the fall of
1990 should be very helpful in determining the lower depth range of the
animal.
An understanding of the benthic habitat and the biology of the mysid
may add insight into the distribution of golden-eyes in the Monterey
Submarine Canyon. The highest density of golden-eye being found at the
