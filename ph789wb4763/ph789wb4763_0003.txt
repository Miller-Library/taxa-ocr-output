Materials and Methods
Golden-eye were recorded on betacam videotape footage taken by a
DXC 3000 Sony camera that was mounted on a remote operated vehicle
(ROV) during dives from March 20, 1989 to March 19,1990. The five
primary dive sites studied cover a range of different areas and habitats in
the Monterey Bay Canyon (Fig. 1). The names and locations for each site
are as follows: Canyon Wall C4-C5 (36 degrees 42'N 122 degrees 00'W),
Soquel Canyon (36 degrees 49'N 121 degrees 59'W), Canyon Wall Meander
(36 degrees 45' N 121 degrees 58'W), Pt. Joe (36 degrees 37'N 122
degrees 01'W), and North Wall (36 degrees 48' N 122 degrees 05'W). The
videotapes were annotated by a technician who recorded the comments of
scientists along with a listing of the organisms seen during the dives. The
video tapes are time coded and tied to a master clock so that annotated
frames are linked to all recorded physical and navigational data. Access
to sets of these data can be gained through a relational computer database.
An analysis of one hundred thirty single frames that had been annotated
with golden-eye and known depth was carried out noting date, site, depth,
number of golden-eye in frame, habitat type, other organisms in
