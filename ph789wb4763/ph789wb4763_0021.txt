Acknowledgements
would like to thank all those who assisted me in completing this
project. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) was
generous in providing access to videotape and in allowing some ROV time
to be spent on viewing and collecting golden-eye. Ã–f particular help at
MBARI were Lynn Lewis, Bruce Gritton, and Chris Harrold. Gilbert Van
Dykhuizen at the Monterey Bay Aquarium was generous in time and
resources with his help in getting holding space and trying to work out the
identification of the golden-eye. Cindy Ashy was very helpful in
suggesting references and supplying equipment. Ladd Johnson provided
assistance in using the camera lucida and offered some insightful
comments in interpreting my data. Alan Baldridge and his library staft
were very helpful and bent over backwards to get needed references.
Finally, I wish to thank my insightful advisor Chuck Baxter. He taught me a
great deal about how science truly works and the value of critical thinking
skills.
