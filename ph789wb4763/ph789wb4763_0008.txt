There was one golden-eye sitting in the upper rim of a conical-shaped
sponge, and what appeared to be two other golden-eye were further down
in the spiral lying motionless. Golden-eye were seen regularly swimming
in and out of hagfish burrows.
We performed qualitative behavioral observations of the golden-eyes
both from the videotape and the aquarium holding tanks. Golden-eye swim
with a hovering motion just above the substrate. They were only seen four
times, in the 130 frames that were analyzed, to be swimming a significant
distance away from the substrate. In only one frame were they seen to be
quiescent above detritus material. In viewing other frames, a rapid
snapping of the abdominal segments at the juncture to the thorax was seen
when a quick escape response action was initiated. The clearest
illustration of this behavior was seen when a golden-eye swam into an
Anthomastus ritteri tentacle and escaped in a fraction of a second.
