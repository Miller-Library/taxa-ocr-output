Abstract
Remote operated vehicle (ROV) dives in the Monterey Bay Canyon
revealed the ubiquitous presence of an unidentified, orange-pigmented
mysid. An analysis of videotape footage taken on numerous ROV dives
during a one year time period was done to examine the distribution,
habitat, and behavior of the mysid. Samples were also taken using a
suction sampler on the ROV and taxonomic and observational studies were
performed on these samples. It was found that the mysid may be a new
species and a proper identification continues to be pursued. A preference
for soft sediment was also found in the mysid, and it is felt that this may
be a reflection of available habitat type and feeding requirements.
Introduction
For the past two years the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI) has been conducting investigations of the Monterey Bay Canyon
using a submersible remote operated vehicle (ROV). Currently the tether
length permits a maximum operating depth of four hundred fifty meters.
