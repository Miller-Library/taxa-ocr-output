Osmotic Response in N. californica
page 6
The high intertidal Nuttallina that were placed in the
mesh bags in 50% seawater gained 19.3% while the low intertidal
chitons gained 26.4%. No significant difference between
weightgain in attached versus unattached animals was found
(student t-test).
B. Freezing Point Depression
The internal body fluid and the external medium of the
chitons were examined for differences in osmotic concentration
using a modification of the method by Gross (Welsh, Smith,
& Kammer, 1968). Nuttallina from both the high and the low
intertidal groups were placed in various salinities as
previously described. At twelve and twenty-four hours one
animal was removed from each salinity, weighed and bled by
inserting a hypodermic needle between the seventh and eighth
plates and extracting with a syringe a small sample of pericardial
fluid, (Boyle, 1969). These samples were placed in capillary
tubes, sealed and frozen along with samples of the solutions.
Results: The results of the freezing point depression
experiments show Nuttallina to be an osmoconformer. The
mean of the osmotic pressures of the internal fluid was within
1.8% of that of the external fluid, which is within the limits
of the definition by Wilbur and Yonge (1964) of osmotic
equilibrium (+ 1 to 2%). Equilibrium had been reached before
the twelfth hour as there was no appreciable difference
between the 12 and the 24 hour samples.
