Osmotic Response in N. californica
INTRODUCTION
Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847), a common intertidal
chiton, has a large vertical range and is found in a variety of
habitats. Though the species is eurytopic, individuals appear
to maintain their particular position in the intertidal for
extended periods (MacGinitie and MacGinitie, 1968). Salinity
variations from 14%, to 45%0 have been measured in pools and
crevices in the intertidal (Boyle, 1969); the range and
duration of osmotic stress would be a function of position in
the intertidal. Chitons are typically isosmotic with seawater,
as are most marine molluscs, but intertidal species subjected
to salinity fluctuations may have developed adaptive responses
to osmotic change, (Prosser, 1973). Previous osmotic studies
on the chiton, Sypharochiton pelliserpentis (Quoy and Gaimard,
1835), in New Zealand (Boyle, 1969 and 1970) showed this species
to be an osmocenformer.
The topic explored in this paper is the response to
osmotic stress in individuals of Nuttallina californica selected
from two micro-habitats differing in vertical height and wave
exposure in a way which has resulted in difference in osmotic
stress histories.
MATERIALS
The study was carried out on individuals taken from Mussel
Point at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California.
