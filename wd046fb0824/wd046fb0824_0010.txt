Osmotic Response in N. californica
FIGURE CAPTION
1.) Mean weight changes (as 8 of original body weight)
of N. californica in experimental solutions of
various salinities. Test salinities in percent
of ambient seawater and number of animals tested
for each condition is indicated. The standan
errors of the means were all less than 38 of the
percent change indicated and thus too small to
indicate graphically.
