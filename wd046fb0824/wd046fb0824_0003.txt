METHODS AND RESULTS
A. Change in weight following osmotic stress.
In order to test for possible differential response to
osmotic stress in the two populations, a series of laboratory
experiments involving measuring weight changes of stressed
animals was conducted. A method of weighing the chiton
with its substrate was devised to avoid the stress of
constantly detaching the chiton. Plastic petri dishes with
holes drilled in the top to allow free exchange of water were
used as containers and were blotted dry and weighed with the
chitons. Experimental animals were collected and placed in
the dishes, kept in running sea water for forty-eight hours
to allow them to acclimate and partially empty their guts.
The salinity of the ambient and circulating seawater
was determined by a salinometer to be 33.9%.. Using this
information the experimental salinities of 50%, 75%, 90%.
95%, 100%, 105%, 110%, 120%, and 125% of the concentration of
local seawater were mixed from "Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea
Salts" (Aquarium Systems, Inc.).
For each solution six or more chitons from each site
were blotted and weighed with their containers before being
placed in 250 ml. finger bowls of test solution. The bowls,
covered to reduce evaopration, remained in the sea table at
a constant temperature of 14° + 1°C. At intervals of 1, 2,
