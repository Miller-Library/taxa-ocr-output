In hypotonic solutions the chitons from the high intertidal
area gained less than the low intertidal chitons. Both
groups, however, showed a decrease in body weight after
reaching an extreme, except in 50% seawater; thus volume
regulation does occur. The difference between the two
groups must be due either to the efficiency of volume regulation
or to differences in the threshold of stress required to
initiate regulation. By having a lower threshold volume
regulation of the high intertidal chitons would start sooner,
thereby reducing the weight gained. Since the chiton is not
an osmoregulator it never returns to its original weight
while still in the hypotonic solution.
The theoretical weight changes deviate from the observed
changes for the 50% and 75% solutions. This can partly be
explained by assuming that 10 - 15% of the body water is
bound by protein and osmotically inactive (Prosser, 1973),
but some type of mechanism working on a switch basis, such
as ionic excretion or the making of monosaccharides from
stored polysaccharides, must also be present to account for
the difference between the two populations,
Since, in hypertonic solutions there is no appreciable
return of body weight toward the original weight it is
unclear if any volume regulation especially since the actual
weight changes come close to the theoretical weight changes.
The greater ability for high intertidal Nuttallina
californica to withstand osmotic stress could have a
genetic basis as in selective larval settling or differential
