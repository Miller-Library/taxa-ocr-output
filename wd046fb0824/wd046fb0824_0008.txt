Osmotic Response in N. californica

survival. This ability seems more likely, though, to be
ontogenetic by development of differences in tissues or
metabolism as a result of exposure to the stress. Further
work needs to be done before this can be answered.
SUMMARY
1) High intertidal Nuttallina californica can cope with
osmotic stress better than the low intertidal chitons as shown
by their smaller weight change.
2) The low intertidal chitons have a slower initial rate
of weight loss in hypertonic seawater.
3) Attached and unattached animals reach the same equilibrium
point so behavior alone can't explain the differences in
osmotic response.
4) There is a large deviation from predicted weight changes
in 50% and 75% seawater which shows that both populations
do exhibit some regulation, but with a difference in
effectiveness.
