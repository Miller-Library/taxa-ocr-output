Theoretical Osmometer

To discover how closely Nuttallina follows the predictions
for a gravimetric osmometer, eight chitons, four from each
group, were weighed and dried to constant weight in a 75°c
drying oven. The percent body water was calculated as was
the theoretical weight change that would be predicted to
occur in each salinity if the chiton was a perfect osmometer
with no bound water,
Results: Water constitutes 61% (Range= 58% - 66%) of the
body weight of the low intertidal Nuttallina and 56% (Range-
53 - 60%) of the high intertidal. The predicted weight
gain in 50% seawater is 61% for the low intertidal yet they
gained an average of only 28.4%, significantly less than
predicted (chi-squared = 17.35, PX.01). The prediction
change for the high intertidal is 56% yet the actual average
weight gain was 19.4%, again significantly less (chi-squared
-23.83, P£.005).
DISCUSSION
High intertidal Nuttallina californica, although
osmoconformers, have developed means to cope with the higher
osmotic stresses associated with their environment. Behavioral
changes, such'as partial exclusion of water in osmotic imbalance
by clamping down, do not completely account for their osmotic
response; their equilibrium point for hypotonic solutions
emains the same whether or not they are attached. It may,
however, affect the rate at which equilibrium is reached,
