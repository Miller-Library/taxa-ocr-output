Osmotic Response in N. californica
One group of animals, taken from the lower intertidal, was
from a vertical face of granite normal to the incoming surf.
These organisms thus were not exposed to sitting water or
extensive evaporation. They were found along with the
coralline algae Corallina vancouveriensis (Yendo), Litho¬
phyllum proboscideum (Foslie) and the barnacle, Balanus glandula
(Darwin, 1854). The other set of animals, taken from the
high intertidal, was from an area protected from direct surf
action by offshore rocks. The chitons were collected on
horizontal ledges, making them exposed to salinity fluctuations
from evaporation or precipitation. In the lower part of this
range were Endocladia muricata (Postels & Ruprecht) J. G.
Agardh, Gigagartina paillata (C. A. Agardh) J. G. Agardh,
Tetraclita squamosa (Darwin, 1854) and Pollicipes polymerus
(Sowerby, 1833).
The chitons in the low intertidal were collected at
a tidal range of 2.1 to 3.7 ft. which is almost completely
below the plus 3.5 ft. critical level (Doty, 1957) where
they are subjected to air exposure less than 10.25 hours a
day. Directly above this level there is an almost two¬
fold increase in exposure time and then it gradually increases
until at 5.0 ft. the maximum exposure is twentythree hours.
The high intertidal Nuttallina were collected between 4.0
and 5.2 ft. and lie in the latter range.
Middle sized chitons were chosen, the mean size of the
experimental animals from the low intertidal population was
1.86 g. and 2.10 g. for the high intertidal population.
