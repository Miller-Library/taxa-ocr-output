Osmotic response in N. californica
3, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 24 hours the chitons were removed, blotted
dry and weighed.
In order to distinguish between a behavioral and a
physiological difference in the two groups' response to
osmotic stress, eight chitons from each site were put in
small mesh bags and placed on their backs in finger bowls
to prohibit their excluding the external medium. Salinities
of water in the bowls, exposure and weighing was as before.
Results: Low intertidal chitons gained more weight due to
osmotic uptake of water, and at a slightly faster rate than
the high intertidal chitons in dilutions of sea water,
(Figure 1). Weight changes are presented as percent change
of original body weight.
In the 95%, 90% and 75% seawater a small decrease
toward the original weight occurred with time in both groups.
No decrease was seen in the 50% medium where the high intertidal
Nuttallina gained an average of 19.4% of their body weight,
significantly less than the mean gain of 28.4% for the low
intertidal chitons (P(.001, n=30, Student ttest).
Low intertidal chitons initially lost weight at
a slower rate than the high intertidal in hypertonic seawater,
but this was reversed after one to two hours so that they
ultimately evidenced a greater percentage change in weight.
For the 120% medium, after twenty-four hours, the low interÂ¬
tidal animals lost an average of 8.9% and the high intertidal
chitons lost 6.6% (P.001, n
