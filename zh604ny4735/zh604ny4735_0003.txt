arranged along the arms and embedded within the musculature of the
arms. In each ganglion, there is an outer cellular layer that
surrounds the neuropil (Young, 1971). Immunohistochemistry
techniques were utilized to examine if GFAP immunoreactivity was
restricted to certain regions of the tissue.
We also carried out comparative studies of GFAP
immunoreactivity in other uninjured cephalopods, Loligo opalescens,
Sepioteuthis lessoniana, and Sepia officianalis.
Materials and Methods
ANIMAL PREPARATION:
Octopi (Octopus rubescens) about 8 inches in arm span were
collected in Monterey Bay, California. They were kept in holding
tanks with circulating sea water and fed small live crabs. For
injury experiments, the animals were anesthesized in 23 ethanol
until arm movements stopped (about 5 to 10 minutes), and four of
the arms were amputated about 3 cm from the tip. The animals were
placed back in the holding tanks. Nine days after amputation, axial
nerve cords were removed from the proximal stumps and control arms
for immunoblotting.
For comparative studies of GFAP immunoreactivity in other
cepahalopods, Loligo opalescens, Sepioteuthis lessoniana, and Sepia
officianalis were used, L. opalescens as collected in Monterey Bay,
Ca.; S. lessoniana as provided by Dr. Roger Hanlon at the
University of Texas, Galveston, Medical Branch; and S. officianalis
as donated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. All three were kept in
