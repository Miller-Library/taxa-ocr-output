tanks with circulating sea water. The nervous system tissues used
for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were removed from these
animals following decapitation without anesthesia.
IMMUNOBLOTTING:
Nervous system tissues were removed from the animals and
placed directly in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 13 SDS, 2
mM EDTA, and 3 mM EGTA. The samples were homogenized in a motor
driven homogenizer, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (Eppendorf microfuge)
for 30 minutes, and the supernatant collected. Protein
concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
assay (Brown et al., 1989). The proteins were separated using 103
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of
Laemmli (1970) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Towbin
et al., 1979). Antibody detections were done on the blots using a
previously described polyclonal rabbit antiserum to human GFAP (Eng
and DeArmond, 1983), monoclonal mouse antiserum to neurofilament
(Sternberger and Sternberger, 1983), and the peroxidase antiÂ¬
peroxidase method (PAP) (Sternberger et al., 1970). To test
specificity of staining, the same rabbit anti-GFAP pre-absorbed
with purified GFAP was obtained from Dr. Lawrence Eng, Department
of Pathology, Stanford University Medical School.
Nonspecific binding was minimized by preincubation with normal
swine serum for polyclonal or normal goat serum for monoclonal; and
all incubations were done in 18 milk in buffer. The blots were
incubated in primary antibodies overnight at a dilution of 1:500.
After incubation in the secondary antibody and the PAP complex,
