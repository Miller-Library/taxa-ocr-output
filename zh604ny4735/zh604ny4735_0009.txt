vertebrate GFAP, there appears to be an increase in expression
following injury. The role of GFAP in glial scarring is well
established in vertebrates (Eng, 1988; Reier et al., 1983). This
increase in the level of GFAP immunoreactivity may constitute a
similar event in the Octopus. Although in the present study we did
not wait long enough for the arms to regenerate, observations have
confirmed that the arms are able to do so (Cousteau and Diole,
1973). Thus it seems that the increase in this GFAP-like protein
expression does not present an obstacle to neural regeneration.
It is possible that the high regenerative capacity of the
nervous system of the Octopus may be related to the high molecular
weight GFAP. In central nervous system tissue from cephalopods of
presumably lower regenerative capacity, Sepia, Loligo, and
Sepioteuthis, we could not detect the 140 KD protein by
immunoblotting. In the peripheral arm nerves of the Sepia and the
peripheral stellate ganglion of the Sepioteuthis, however, we were
able to see cross reactivity with the antibody.
Thus, there may be a link between this GFAP-like protein and
vertebrate GFAP beyond shared antigenic properties. Structural and
biochemical similarities may be reflected in functional
similarities as well.
