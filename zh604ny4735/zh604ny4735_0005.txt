cross-reacting proteins were visualized by development in 3,3'-
diaminobenzidine.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
Tissues were removed from animals and fixed in 43
paraformaldehyde at 4'C for 48 hours. Paraffin sections of these
tissues were prepared by standard techniques (Galigher and Kozloff,
1964). Briefly, tissues were dehydrated through graded alcohol,
alcohol replaced with xylene, and tissues gradually infiltrated
with melted paraffin. The infiltrated tissues were then embedded in
paraffin and sectioned at 10 microns with a steel knife microtome
and mounted on albumin coated slides. Prior to immuostaining, the
slides were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through graded
alcohol, and treated with acetylated Trypsin (Sigma Chemicals) and
hydrogen peroxide. Immunostaining was done using the same
antibodies as described above and the PAP method. The sections were
then counterstained and mounted for viewing.

IMMUNOBLOTTING:
The polyclonal anti-GFAP cross reacted with one band (140 KD)
in transblots of optic lobe and axial nerve cords from uninjured
Octopus (fig. la). This protein is of higher molecular weight than
mammalian GFAP (48-51 KD). However, using the same antibody preÂ¬
absorbed with the purified mammalian antigen, the band was
eliminated (data not shown). To further demonstrate that the
