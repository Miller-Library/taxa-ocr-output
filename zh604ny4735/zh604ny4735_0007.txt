layers rich in cell bodies, in particular the interganglionic
regions (fig. 3a). In Sepioteuthis stellate ganglion, the antibody
stained material which seemed to surround and adhere tightly to the
large neuronal cell bodies (fig. 4a). In contrast, anti-NF stained
the cytoplasm of these cell bodies (fig. 4b). In sections of
Octopus axial nerve cords, anti-NF stained mostly the neuropil and
nerves (fig 3b).
GFAP IMMUNOREACTIVITY IN CEPHALOPODS:
Immunoblotting was also carried out using tissue homogenates
from other uninjured cephalopods. We were able to detect the 140 KD
protein in the axial nerve cords of Sepia. Results with Loligo
stellate ganglion were not conclusive, probably because of an
insufficient amount of tissue to work with. The results of
experiments on various tissue sources are summarized in figure 5.
We were not able to detect this protein in the central nervous
systems of the cuttlefish or squid; this is in contrast to the case
in Octopus.
Discussion
The level of differentiation and specialization of glial cells
tends to be a function of the complexity of the nervous system of
an organism (Cardone and Roots, 1990). At the level of cephalopods,
the development of the gliovascular system (Young, 1971) is an
indication of this trend of specialization and differentiation. In
