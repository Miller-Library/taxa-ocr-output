IV. General Summary.
Mytilus californianus maintained in solutions of filtered
sea water of 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 ppb DDT showed no conÂ¬
sistent change in rate of respiration or filtering.
Mytilus fed on Nitzschia in a one ppb DDT solution increased
the level of DDT in the soft tissues to 562 (range 29 to 911)
opb in 24 hours; to 880 (range 451 to 1358) ppb in 48 hours; to
1253 (range 390 to 2056) ppb in 72 hours; and to 1307 (range 641
to 2692) ppb in 96 hours. Measurements of respiration and
filtering rates taken of subsamples of the test group at 24 hour
intervals showed no significant difference between the test
organisms exposed to DDT and the controls.
Mytilus californianus can concentrate DDT in its soft
issues up to 2.7 ppm by wet weight with no apparent reduction
in the rates of filtering or respiration.
