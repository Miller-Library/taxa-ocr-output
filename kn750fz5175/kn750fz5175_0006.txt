hour period so the DDT available to the Mytilus would not be
steadily depleted. Controls contained ethanol and Nitzschia
suspension, but not DDT. At twelve hour intervals, five test
Mytilus and five control organisus were tested for changes in
rate of respiration, then for changes in rate of filtering.
Mussels were tested individually, and tests were run alternately
on experimental and control organisms. After measuring respir-
ation and filtering rates, the organisms were sacrificed and
the soft parts were extracted and weighed.
The amount of DDT taken up by the Mytilus was determined
by using C-DDT in a parallel experiment. Mytilus incubated
in radioactive DDT with Nitzschia were allowed to remain in
filtered sea water for six hours after removal from the radio-
active suspension so that radioactive food in the gut would be
eliminated in fecal pellets. The soft parts of the organism
which had taken up C-DDT were weighed, and then homogenized
in four mls. of N,N, dimethyl-formimide. Ten mls. of Toluene
scintillating fluid were added; the vials were counted in a
scintillation counter.
The rate of filtering, respiration and C14-DDT uptake
were determined at 12, 24, and 36 hours (fig. 3). The average
ppb DDT (wet weight) accumulated by the mussels during these
incubations were 150, 438, and 549 respectively. The filtering
rate decreased in both the control and test animals. Respiration
increased and then decreased in both, but experimental animals
showed greater changes in respiration than the controls. The
