size of the interfilamentary gill slits which in turn affects
filtration rate. Ciliary activity on the gill filaments is
affected by acetylcholine (Bulbring et al, 1953), and by other
activating compounds, such as serotonin (Aiello, 1960; Gosselin,
1961). Wurster (1969) suggests that DDT sometimes acts as a
neurotoxin which induces repetivive firing in the nerve axon.
If this occurs in the gill, aberrant filtering and respiration
rates might result.
Test organisms used in these experiments were collected
from April to June on Mussel Point in Monterey Bay, California.
The Mytilus population in this area declined sharply during
1969. I felt this decline might be attributable to increasing
levels of DDT in the bay, caused by extensive flooding of adÂ¬
jacent farmlands and massive run-off in January and February,
1969.
II. Determination of the rates of filtering and respiration
in Mytilus.
Filtering rate was determined by measuring the rate of
clearing by Mytilus of colloidal graphite particles ("Aquadag'
by the Acheson Co.) from suspension in sea water. Changes in
suspension density were measured in a Klett electrophotometer.
The organisms tested were sufficiently small (0.5 to 1.5 cm.
long) to be placed directly in the Klett tubes, alleviating
the need for sampling of the suspension. Other reasons for
selecting small mussels were that they are less sensitive to
handling than larger organisms (Jorgensen, 1949), and they
