are less likely to spawn. Klett tubes containing Nytilus
were kept at about 15°C since increased temperature may induce
resting (Vallengren, 1905), while at normal sea temperatures,
Mytilus pumps continuously. All animals used were taken from
the same elevation because Mytilus from the lower intertidal
pump more rapidly than those from higher up (Segal et al, 1953)
The average diameter of the particles was kept betveen three
and 7.5 microns because particle size affects rate of filtering
(Tammes & Dral, 1955). Suspensions in the Klett tubes were
stirred with a glass rod at ten minute intervals, taking care
not to disturb the mussels. The density of the suspension
was read in the Klett immediately after the tubes were stirred.
Since the rate of filtering decreases with an increase in the
concentration of the suspension (Tammes & Dral, 1955), I chose
an initial suspension density of about 150 Klett units (10'
particles per ml.). Rate of particle precipitation is negli-
gible as compared with the average rate of removal of particles
by a healthy Mytilus (fig. 1). During the experiments with
DT, the rate of removal of particles was recorded for three
ten minute intervals after the suspension was down to 150 Klett
units. The average rate of removal of particles by Mytilus
D.5 to 1.5 cm. long was 222 units per hour.
Jörgensén (1949) points out that this method does not
determine the total amount of water filtered unless the sus-
pended material is retained by the gills. As part of my
preliminary study, I drilled holes in the shells of several
Mytilus, allowed them to recover, and observed them under the
