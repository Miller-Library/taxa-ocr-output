DDT has also been found in studies on the effect of DDT on
phytoplankton (Bailey, 1969) and zooplankton (Hunter, 1969)
his experiment was repeated and extended to 96 hours.
The only changes in procedure were that the suspensions of
Nitzschia in DDT were changed every four hours, and the res-
piration and filtering measurements were conducted at 24 hour
intervals. The parallel C-DDT uptake experiments indicated
that the average DDT uptake was 562, 880, 1253, and 1307 ppb

Mytilus was 2.7 ppm at the end of a 96 hour incubation.
gain in this experiment (fig. 4), there were no statis-
tically significant differences in the rates of respiration
and filtering between the test and the control organisms.
Changes in the rate of filtering and in respiration associated
with an average uptake of 1.3 ppm DDT and lesser amounts are
obscured by the variability shown by individuals exposed to
milar conditions. Some variability is expected because single
organisms can vary the pore size of their gill filters and can
selectively exude a mucous sheet which will affect filtering rate.
Variability cannot be attributed to differences in established
tidal rhythms for oxygen consumption rate (Gompel, 1937, 1938)
and rate of water propulsion (Rao, 1954), since all animals used
in any particular experiment were collected at the same time
and place. Further experiments need to be run using Mytilus
which have attained still higher tissue levels of DDT.
