was dissolved in 95% ethanol. The control organisms were
given an equal concentration of ethanol in filtered sea water.
Following exposure to the DDT, the mussels were tested for any
change in filtering rate.
In all cases, no damage attributable to the DDT was observed.
Even at the highest concentration, one ppb DDT (fig. 2), there
was little difference between the mean filtering rates of the
experimental organisms and the controls. However, Mytilus in
most experiments showed an initial increase and subsequent
decrease in filtering rate. Uptake of DDT during this experiment
was not determined, but parallel experiments using C-DDT under
similar conditions, indicate levels of about 150 ppb (Davis, 1969

8. The effect of ingestion of DDT with food.
In order to increase the concentration of DDT in the mussels,
test organisms were fed Nitzschia closterium minutissima incubated
in sea water containing DDT. Nitzschia was selected because it
is small (thirty microns long) and stays in suspension (Galstoff,
1937). Preliminary feeding experiments and gut analyses showed
that the Nitzschia was ingested. Some diatoms passed through
the Mytilus unaffected, but skeletons of others were found in the
fecal pellets. The Nitzschia (2 x 10 cells/ml.) were incubated
in one ppb DDT in filtered sea water for six hours. 200 mls. of
the Nitzschia-DDT suspension were added to each of three 400 ml.

pensions in the jars were changed every three hours over a 36
