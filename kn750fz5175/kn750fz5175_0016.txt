Fig. 1.
Rate of clearing of colloidal graphite from suspension by
tilus. The most uniform clearing rates occurred at densities
between 150 and 50 Klett units.
Fig. 2.
Filtering rate of Mytilus exposed to 1 ppb DDT in filtered sea
water. Bars show means, 95% confidence limits, and ranges.
Striped bars indicate experimental animals, white bars the controls.
Fig. 3.
Rates of filtering and respiration in Mytilus fed on Nitzschia
in sea water containing one ppb DDT. Bars show means, 95%
confidence limits, and ranges. Solid black bars indicate
the C14-DDT uptake (use right hand scale.) Striped bars rep
resent test organisms, white bars the controls.
