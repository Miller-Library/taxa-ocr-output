Introduction.
Mytilus californianus is an abundant, suspension feeding
lamellibranch which attaches to surf-beaten intertidal rocks
on the west coast from Alaska to Mexico. Like other marine
organisms analyzed for residues of chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides, this mussel concentrates DDT in its tissues.
Risebrough (1966) found 19 to 84 ppb DDT residues in the Mytilus
californianus on the California coast. Mussels are eaten by
several marine invertebrates (Pisaster; Feder, 1959), birds
(Night Heron; Palmer, 1962, and Black Oyster-catcher; Vebster
1941), sea otters (Limborough, 1961) and man.
Mytilus is exposed to DDT residues in the environment.
It tolerates considerable change in salinity (Fox et al, 1936),
and can inhabit areas receiving run-off from land. It feeds
on particulate matter to which DDT adheres readily. When Mytilus
concentrates plankton and detritus in insoluble pseudofeces and
feces, particles carryimg DDT are passed to the benthos.
The physiological effects of sublethal concentration of
DT in Mytilus are not known. Possible effects of DDT here
include alteration of shell deposition, since DDT is known to
affect carbonic anhydrase (Keller, 1932), and changes in meta-
abolic rate, foot and valve movement, ciliary beat, byssal
fiber secretion, and strength of the feeding current.
Filtering rate and respiration were chosen as indices of
damage to Mytilus caused by DDT taken up directly from sea
water or ingested with food. Both respiration and filtering
are performed by the gill. The gill musculature regulates the
