microscope. When placed in a graphite suspension, these
mussels moved the particles down the filaments and along the
food groove. Most particles were then extruded as pseudofeces;
very few carbon particles were found in gut samples. MacGinitie
(1941) observed that Mytilus in a graphite suspension tend to
stop forming a mucous sheet on the gills, though the cilia
continue to beat. Considering this effect, the removal of
graphite particles is an index of filtering but not necessarily
an index of feeding.
Respiration was determined by measuring the uptake of
oxygen by Mytilus placed individually in 125 ml. reagent bottles
filled with filtered sea water which had been bubbled with air
until saturated. The initial and final oxygen content of the
bottles were determined by the Winkler method (Strickland, 1968).
known amount of Nitzschia closterium minutissima (2 x 10 cells/ml.
was added to each bottle as this suspension increased the mussel's
measurable activity. Bottles were incubated at 15°C in dim
light for six hours.
Experimental conditions, results and discussion.
A. The effect of direct uptake of DDT from sea water.
Tour groups of five test organisms each were incubated
at 15°C in concentrations of DDT of 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001. ppt
in filtered sea water, for periods of 12 to 132 hours. Each
group of five test organisms was placed in 200 mls. of filtered
sea water with DDT in a closed 400 ml. air tight container in
order to prevent loss of DDT by codistillation. The DDT inoculant
