measurements refer to the same thing-to the variation of the separation
between the grooves. The stretching and contracting of the squid
diffraction grating could then possibly involve an acto-myosin contractile
system as is suggested by the presence of filamentous actin in the
connective tissue underneath the platelets. All these questions and mand
more remain to be answered in further investigations.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

Special thanks also to Dr. Daniel Mazia for his advice and encouragement

the extinction of squid in the Monterey Bay and providing me with some
specimens. Many thanks also to als members of the Thompson lab: to Sam

and William Timmins. I am also grateful to Roger Hanlon for his support and
advice, to all the Hopkins Marine Station faculty for making this class
