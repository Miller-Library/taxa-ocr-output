The general approach in this studg consisted of breaking up the
components in the cell in order to identify the component responsible for
iridescence. The question remains to be answered: How are these striated
ribbon-like structures put together and arranged in a three dimensional
cell? The structures are 50-70um wide and can can attain manq times that
size in length. The cell, we will recall, is 170um long and about 5Oum wide.
It is possible that the ribbon-like structures weave up and down and back
up, with the strietions parallel to the long axis of the cell. This would
explain the 50um (notice that this is also the width of striated ribbon) the
rod-like structuresâ€”termed platelets. The platelets would actually be part
of a larger convoluted ribbon. This would also be supported by the fact that
the cell is only iridescent if incident light is coming from a direction
parallel to the short axis of the cell. Diffraction gratings work best when
the light is perpendicular to the grooves. Thus such arrangement could be
possible but more evidence is needed to confirm it.
How can squid regulated their iridescence? They mag have developed
a method of changing the spacing between the grooves of its diffraction
grating. It has been reported that platelets change thickness upon
stimulation with acetylcholine (Cooper et al. 1990). In that report tissue
was observed with transmission electron microscopg which mag have
obscured three-dimentional information. The changes in thickness of
platelets and space between platelets could be interpreted as a stretching
and contracting of the diffraction grating. This report suggests that the
distances between the grooves of the grating range between.73 and 1.34um
The space between the platelets reported by Cooper et al. was about .25 um.
Considering that the second value was made on fixed cells, which mag have
undergone some artifactual changes, it is possible that these two
