ABSTRACT
Iridophores in Sepisteuthis lessanians were studied bu light
microscopic and ultrestructural techniques in order to identifu the
component of the cell responsible for iridescence. The thin film
interference was considered as a possible explanation for iridescence. This
hypothesis was rejected when the source of iridescence was isolated and
identified as a diffraction grating. These results suggest that the dorsal
iridophores could vary their degree of iridescence by changing the
conformation or spacing of the grooves making up the grating.
