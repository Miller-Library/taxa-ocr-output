were made in the following manner: Live squid were anesthetized in a small
dish containing sea water and 1-22 EtOH solution. The squid were
decapitated, and an incision was made along the middle of the ventral side
of the mantle. The internal organs were removed, and the skin was pinned
out on a sylgard covered petri dish (chromatophores up). The preparation
was immersed in cold artificial seawater (450mM Nacl, 1OmM Caclz, 1Om
KCI, 5OmM NgC12,1OmM HEPES, pH 7.8) to prevent the skin from desiccating.
The first two dermal lagers including the chromatophore lager were
removed with forceps and the iridophore lager was used.
Morphologicel studies. All the iridophore tissue observed was treated
for at least 15 min with 18 Triton X-100 in KGE (KGE: 3M potassium
gluconate, 33M glycine, 2mM magnesium chloride, 2mM EGTA, pH 6.8).
Unused cell tissue was preserved at sub-zero temperature KGE with 508
glycerol and 18 Triton. Both preserved and fresh tissue were examined
under transmitted light and incident light. Pictures were taken using a
35mm Olympus or a Nikon camera mounted directly to the microscope.
Iridophore cells were also video taped as theg were illuminated from
different angles (optical fibers were used). Video taped data was analyzed
and printed using a MegaVision image processor.
Folerized light snalysis. Iridophore cells and platelets were observed
under a polarized light microscope. The 40X lens was used.
Differentisl Interference Centrast. Iridophore cells were examined
with DIC under a 40X lens. DIC was set on max extinction and then on either
side of max extinction.
Staining Cell tissue was washed with cold KGE and stretched out on
a microscope slide. The tissue was stained with the nuclear stain DAPI for
