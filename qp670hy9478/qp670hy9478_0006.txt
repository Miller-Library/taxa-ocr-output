tissue below the iridophores cells (Figure 6). Platelets did not stain for
actin.
Effect of incressing calcium concentration Increasing calcium
concentration did not appear to have ang effect on the platelet shape. The
degree of reflected light appeared to have remained unchanged (Figure 7).
Scanning electren microscepu Scanning electron microscopy of
individual platelets revealed ribbon-like structure. The platelet is about
50-70um wide with regularlg spaced grooves on one side. The groove
spacing was bimodal, with intervals of .73um or 1.34um (Figure 8).
DISCUSSION
Iridescence in squid and other cephalopods was thought to come as a
result of thin film interference of incident light rags (Denton and Land
1971) or of a diffraction grating: where light diffracts from the edges of
parallel platelets that are on edge relative to the skin surface (Brocco and
Cloneg 1980; Cloneg and Brocco 1983). In this studg evidence suggest that a
diffraction grating is indeed the source of iridescence, but on a smaller
scale than that described by Brocco and Cloney--namely within each
individual platelet (figure 9).
Simple examination of the iridophore under incident light is
indicative of a highlg organized cell. The cells were found to iridesce only
if light came from a specific direction. Besides, observation of tissue with
polarized light revealed that components in the cell were birefringent. This
suggests that whatever is responsible for iridescence must be arranged in a
very particular wag.
The platelets, almost alwags parallel to the long axis of the cell,
were assumed to be the elements responsible for the directional specificitu
