Attempts to destrog iridescence by disorganizing the platelets within the
cell failed. Roger Hanlon already noticed that platelets curl up, or
disorg채nize themselves upon extended exposure to Triton X-100. Howeyer
results of this studg show that such cells still give off rainbow colors; thet
still iridesce. Furthermore digestion of detergent treated cells with
proteases disintegrated the platelets to an even greater degree. This
confirms Hanlon's statement that the platelets are made up of proteinaceous
material. Surprisingly, the digested material was also iridescent (Figure 4).
It became clear that what was necessary for iridescence was the materia
of which the platelets are made and not the platelets as a whole or their
organization.
Examination of an individual platelet revealed a ribbon-like structure
with regular striations on only one of its sides. This is highly reminiscent
of a conventional diffraction grating and leaves little doubt as to the source
of iridescence. The platelet thickness was plotted versus its relative
frequency (graph 1). The ribs of the grating appear to come in two preferred
widths: .7Zum and 1.34um. Using the diffraction grating formula, a sins=m
(a=space between grooves, 8-angle of incidence with respect to the normal,
m=interference maxima, and A=wavelength) and substituting .73 and 1.34
for a, 1 for m, the range of 0 for which visible light (400-700nm) is given
off is 17-31째 and 33-72째 respectivelg. These values confirm that the
structures observed under scanning electron microscopy are capable of
creating visible light of different wavelength. This calculation predicts the
absence of iridescence when light is shone from directlg above and when De
17째. Transmitted light (light coming from directly above) fails to produce
iridescence which provides additional support for the diffraction grating
model.
