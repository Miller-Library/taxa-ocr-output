(Figure 1). Within these cells there were rodlike structures parallel to the
long axis of the cell. Platelets were approximatelg Soum long, but they
varied in length. When incident light was shone on the same piece of tissue
from different directions cells iridesced onlg if they were oriented with
their long axis perpendicular to the direction of illumination (Figure 2).
Freservation methad Iridescent cells were very well preserved in
KGE with 18 Triton X-100 and 508 glycerol.
Petergent Extrectien Triton X-100 extraction dissolved enough of
the membranous components to improve microscopical observation.
Extended treatment (more than two hours) of iridophores with detergent
caused the platelets to curl up. Eventually the platelets completely lost
their organization but in themselves appeared to remain intact. Such
platelets were still iridescent.
Frotesse digestions Platelets were fragmented upon digestion while
the control platelets kept in the same conditions without protease remained
the same. Trypsin, pronase (Figure 3), and collagenase tupe A1 were most
effective at desintegrating the platelets into smaller pieces whereas papain
and dispase were least effective. When observed under incident light, the
digested platelets were still reflecting light (Figure 4) and the reflection
corresponded to pieces of platelets.
Polerized light anslysis Both the connective tissue and individual
platelets were birefringent.
Differential Interference Contrast DIC revealed different indexes of
refraction within the Triton-treated cell (Figure 5).
Steining DAPI staining showed that the center of the cell, which
appeared devoid of platelets, is the site of the cell's nucleus (Figure 1).
Rhodamine phalloidin stain identified filamentous actin in the connective
