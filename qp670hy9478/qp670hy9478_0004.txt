3 min, cover-slipped and observed under the fluorescence microscope. Some
tissue was also stained for actin with rhodamine phalloidin.
Frotesse digestion 12 solutions of trypsin, collagenase tupe A1,
papain, pronase, and dispase were prepared in Eppendorf tubes. Tissue
samples pretreated with 12 Triton X-100 were digested at room
temperature for two hours. Pictures were taken on the inverted microscope
at various intervals.
Effect of calcium concentration Iridophore cells pretreated with
Triton X-100 were washed with KGE (EGTA is a calcium chelating agent). A
piece of the tissue was then glued to a microscope slide and cover-slipped.
The cells were illuminated with incident light coming from a fixed lamp.
The cells were filmed as a high calcium (Cat2 was 1OuM) solution of KGE
was perfused through the preparation. Video taped data was analuzed on the
MegaVision image processor.
Platelet isolation. A piece of iridophore tissue, preserved by the
method described above, was washed with KGE and spread out on a
microscope slide. Platelets were mechanically teased awag under the
microscope. The KGE solution containing iridophore platelets was
centrifuged. Platelets were dehgdrated by resuspending and centrifuging in
302, 402, 502, 602, 702, 802, 902, 952, and finally 100 EtOH. The
platelets were then centrifuged once more and resuspended in
hexmethgldisilazane. Dehgdrated platelets were examined under scanning
electron microscopq.
RESULTS
Cell morphology. Microscopical examination of the iridophore lager
revealed elongated, football-shaped cells about 170um long and 50um wide
