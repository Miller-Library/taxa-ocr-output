INTRODUCTION
The skin of the squid, Sepisteuthis lessanians, displays a wide range
of body patterns. These colorful patterns are thought to be useful in
camouf lage and visual communication (Hanlon, 1982). Iridophores are cells
that work in conjunction with chromatophores to change the outward
appearance of the squid mantle. As their name indicates, iridophores are
iridescent: theg are capable of giving off colors. This rainbow color effect
seems to be caused by the organization of platelet-like structures of high
refractive index within the cell (Brocco and Cloneg, 1980).
Iridophore cells are found all over the squid mantle in the third
dermal lager. They exist in two types: Physiologically active iridophores
found on the dorsal side of the squid are capable of varging the wavelength
of the color theg iridesce. Theg can be stimulated in vitroby acetylcholine
or by the Catt ionophore 423 187 (Cooper and Hanlon, 1986). Cells on the
ventral side, however, are incapable of such modulation and are
subsequently called inactive.
Although some work has been done in elucidating the mechanism by
which iridescence is modified (Cooper et al, 1990), few studies have been
aimed at explaining "iridescence" as such. This paper describes a studg of
the structure in iridophore cells responsible for this phenomenon.
HATERIALS AND HETHODS
Cell tissue preperstions Sepiateuthis lessonisnswere obtained from
the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and kept in a 120 liter
tank with 21-22Â°C water. The squid were fed dailg and maintained in
healthy condition until they were used. Unless specified skin preparations
