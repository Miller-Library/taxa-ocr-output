<span style='background-color:grey' title='Pachygrapsus crassipes : Fuzzy'>Pachygrapsis crassipes,</span> the lined purple shore crab, is equipped with extremely sensitive
sensory hairs on its walking legs. These hairs potentially play a major role in mediating the
crab’s sensory relationship with its environment, including encoding vital information such as
the approach of predators. This study examined the vibratory sensitivity of these tactile sensors
in order to quantify the frequency range to which they respond, as well as their absolute level of
sensitivity. Electrophysiological methods were used to determine the sensors' threshold to
impulse-like stimuli. Neuronal responses were then tested over a wide range of frequencies and
intensities to more completely quantify the sensitivity range.
Introduction
In the middle of the 20" century, pioneer German ethologist Baron Jacob
Von Uexkull introduced the idea that all animals live within unique, species-specific perceptual
worlds which he entitled their “Umwelt". A species' Umwelt defines its environment in relation
to its sensory capabilities. Information outside of these capabilities is imperceptible and,
therefore, effectively does not exist. In the 1934 essay entitled "A Stroll through the Worlds of
Animals and Men: A picture book of invisible worlds", Uexkull described the Umwelt as being
“like soap-bubble surrounding an individual being, filtering all it sees and feels." In less ethereal
terms, the Umwelt represents the result of a long-period of evolutionary adaptation to a particular
environment, which has led to the ability to detect and filter sensory cues essential to survival,
and ignore uninformative sensory "noise". To this effect, the Umwelt's of different species have
different richness, often corresponding to the complexity of their behavior. A classic example of
an “impoverished" Umwelt is that of a tick, which is sensitive to only three specific sensory cues
allowing it to detect its mammalian host. This can be strikingly contrasted with the Umwelt of a
human, which includes sensitivity to broad color spectra and sound frequency, and highly-
developed olfactory and tactile capabilities. This contrast accentuates one of the greatest benefits
attained from Uexkull's idea: freedom from the belief that all animals perceive the world in the
same manner as humans. This means to truly understand an animal, humans must first
understand its sensory capabilities, and the sensory cues which shape and define its Umwelt.
Pursuit of this understanding is the goal of the newly emerging scientific field, Sensory
Ecology, the integration of sensory physiology and ecology. In a world filled with an incredible
amount of information, sensory ecologists seek to quantify what information is filtered out by an
animal, and in what way, in order to mediate its interaction with its environment. What
information has the animal evolved to define the boundaries of its Umwelt, and how does this
information help it be maximally fit?
The recognition of restricted windows of sensory sensitivity in animals has drawn
attention to a potential new source of human-induced environmental harm. Human activities
often introduce a large amount of sensory "noise" into the surrounding environment. One of the
most widely recognized types of this sensory pollution is auditory or vibratory noise, which is
commonly associated with activities such as construction and transportation. Sound sensitivity
varies widely among animals (Fig. 1) and is used in many different ways, often playing a vital
role in communication and predator-prey interactions. Human-produced sound that falls withir
the frequency range of these environmental cues could confuse or limit an animal’s ability to
perceive important sound signals, and therefore reduce its fitness.
Studies examining this possibility have recently been undertaken by the navy and the Air
Force, both of which create a substantial amount of vibrational noise in the environment. The
navy, which often uses high amplitude acoustic signals under water, examined the frequency
sensitivity range of cetaceans, such as dolphins and whales, which rely on acoustic signals for
communication. In one such study they determined that the baleen whale vocalized from 15-
8000 Hz, well within the range of anthropogenic sources. This implied that naval activities
could interfere in the whales' communicational channels. In similar examinations, the airforce
found that aircraft noise and sonic booms could cause the masking of signals in some species and
populations of wildlife (Manci et al. 1988). In addition, airforce researchers found marked
secondary effects of environmental noise introduction on various animals, including non¬
auditory impacts such as stress, behavioral changes, mating interference and detrimental changes
in the ability to obtain food. In one such study, lab rodents and rabbits continuously exposed to
general noise from 50 Hz - 40kHz demonstrated a range of responses, from “anxiety-like"
behavior, to complex physiological effects such as increased urinary excretion of sodium and
potassium, excretion of vasopressin, and suppressed thyroid activity (Manci et al. 1988). These
studies make it clear that quantification of animal sensory sensitivity provides a valid new
framework within which to view human environmental impact.
It is with this framework in mind that this experiment was designed. The lined purple
shore crab, Pachygrapsis crassipes is a common intertidal organism along the central California
coast. Sensory hairs on its walking legs are known to function as vibrational sensors which
mediate its responsiveness to substrate-borne vibrations (Fig. 2). Numerous studies have been
performed on the vibrational sensitivity of the distantly related <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Uca : Exact'>Uca</span> genus, fiddler crabs, which
produce vibrational signals as a part of their mating ritual by rhythmically drumming on rocky
substrate with their enlarged chelae (Salmon 1971). These studies thoroughly quantify the
vibrational sensitivity and response patterns of these crabs' leg sensors, as well as those of their
vibration responsive CNS interneurons (Hall 1985, Aicher and Tautz 1983, Aicher and Tautz
1990, Salmon 1971). Similar studies have been performed to quantify the vibrational sensitivity
of cercal hairs in the cricket and cockroach (Buno et al. 1981, Dagan and Camhi 1979,
Matsumoto and Murphey 1977, Buno et al. 1981) All of this work demonstrates that vibrational
sensitivity is an extremely important element of the arthropod sensory system, playing a diverse
and substantial role in their interactions with the environment.
Although vibrational sensitivity makes up an important part of the sensory world, or
Umwelt, of Pachygrapsis, little is known about the range of vibrational stimuli to which they
respond. The goal of this study, therefore, was to begin to quantify this range in order to
understand what these crabs "hear" in their noisy vibrational environment. Defining this window
of sensitivity is the first step in understanding the possible effects of anthropogenic vibrations
introduced into the crab’s environment by human near-shore activity. If these vibrations lie
within the sensitivity range of Pachygrapsis, they could be "jamming" the sensitivity channel of
the crab and therefore substantially reducing its fitness, and ability to relate to its environment.
Materials and methods
Subjects:
Pachygrapsis crassipes of indiscriminant size, gender and age were collected by hand
from the intertidal area of Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. Animals were kept up to three days in a
tank which was continuously refreshed by unfiltered seawater.
Leg preparation:
All experiments were performed on isolated walking legs of the experimental subjects.
The legs were pinned in a small dish of seawater and the leg nerve exposed. Extracellular
recordings from the nerve were taken with a hook electrode connected to a recording amplifier
(Grass Instruments). The amplifier fed to an oscilliscope used to visualize nervous output, as
well as a computer data acquisition system using the software program P-Clamp 8.
Scanning Electron Microscope:
Samples were air dried, mounted on carbon tape and sputter coated with gold, then
viewed with a Hitachi S-450 scanning electron microscope at 15 kv.
Threshold determination:
High-frequency, impulse-like stimuli were produced by dropping differently sized steel
ball bearings from various heights onto a steel table upon which the leg was mounted. The ball
was dropped from an angled slide attached to a metal stand to ensure that it fell from the desired
height. A strain gauge fastened to the table under the slide recorded the exact moment of
stimulus application. A custom-built amplifier fed the signal from the gauge into the computer.
This data was aligned with the corresponding output from the leg to allow direct comparison
between stimulus application and nervous response. Stimulus intensity was measured in
Newton-meters (N-m), the gravitational potential energy imparted to the table by ball impact.
Varied frequency.
To test receptor response to a variety of different frequencies, a speaker cone was
fastened to the side of a plastic stand supporting the prepared leg. A function generator fed
sinusoidal frequency functions of 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 Hz to a stereo amplifier which
drove the speaker cone via a power amplifier. Frequencies were applied in random order at two
different amplitudes, and approximately every third recording was made without applied
stimulus to control for receptor fatigue. Each trial lasted 500 ms and was recorded as a single
file by the computer to allow later comparison.
Results
Threshold determination:
Leg response to stimulus application was scored according to a binary scheme. A score
of 1 indicated a positive receptor response to applied stimulus, and 0 indicated none (Fig 3).
Threshold sensitivity of the leg was stochastic, lying within the range of 1.4 * 10°-3.9 * 10° N-
m. Within this range response to stimulus application was variable. Above the range responses
were consistently 1 and below they were consistently 0 (Fig 4).
Varied frequency.
Lower frequency stimuli (10-50 Hz) elicited a phase-locked response in the leg's output
train, demonstrated by autocorrelation analysis. Significant correlation in the output signal
occurred at intervals corresponding to single cycles of the sinusoidal stimuli. This indicated that
the leg was firing a patterned response locked to the frequency of the stimulus (Fig. 5). At
frequencies above 50 Hz phase-locking was no longer observed (Fig. 6).
Stimulus frequencies from 50-200 Hz elicited an increase in temporal firing rate in the
leg nerve. This was measured by counting the number of action potentials surpassing a certain
threshold level set by eye directly above background recording noise. Data were normalized to
account for small changes in firing rate as the leg fatigued. Normalization was performed by
dividing the counts during the test run by the average of the counts from control recordings taken
directly before and after. A normalized value greater than 1 indicates an increased firing in
response to applied stimuli. All normalized values resulting from the application of a particular
stimulus frequency and amplitude were averaged to quantify the general response to stimulus of
that intensity. The higher amplitude stimuli consistently elicited a greater temporal firing rate
than the lower, although the difference is nearly indistinguishable at a frequency of 1000Hz (Fig.
7). Neither data analysis technique was able to demonstrate sensitivity to vibrational stimuli
with frequency greater than 500 Hz.
Discussion
The threshold determination phase of the experiment proved the crabs' vibrational
sensors to be extremely responsive to high-frequency impulse stimuli. Many important
environmental signals in the crabs' natural habitat, such as the pecking of predatory birds,
produce impulse vibrations similar to the artificial stimulus applied (Thompson, personal
communication). The crabs' high degree of sensitivity, therefore, is unsurprising. Putting this
result into an applicable environmental context would require measuring the scaling factor
between signal propagation in the steel table and in the rocky substrate of the intertidal. This
would allow direct quantification of crab sensitivity to impulse stimuli in their natural
environment in terms of distance from the stimulus source.
While testing the response of the leg receptors to various frequencies of vibrational
stimuli, it was interesting to see changes in the nervous response pattern with the application of
different frequency ranges. Lower frequency stimuli of 10-50 Hz elicited obvious phase-locking
in the receptor output, but vibrations above 50 Hz did not. This may simply be due to constraints
in the speed of successive action potentials resulting from intrinsic properties of the individual
neurons. It may also, however, indicate that different neurons, with different output
characteristics, are responding at the different frequencies. Due to limitations in the
experimental methods, it was not possible to differentiate and record from single vibration¬
sensitive neurons within the leg nerve. Aicher and Tautz (1983), in experiments on the leg nerve
of the fiddler crab <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Uca pugilator : Exact'>Uca pugilator</span> were able to identify two types of neurons in the walking-leg
nerve which responded differently to sinusoidal mechanical stimuli. One of these neuron types
was excited only in the frequency range of 2-100 Hz. While no assumptions are made here as to
morphological similarities between these two crab species, this indicates the possibility that
individual nerve fibers respond differently to the application of distinct stimulus frequency
ranges.
It is also possible that the different response patterns result from the activation of
different vibration-sensitive receptors in the leg. The crab dactyl is covered with sensory hairs of
different size, position and morphology (Fig 2), which may be differentially recruited to encode
stimuli within specific frequency ranges. It is likely that different receptor populations synapse
with different neuronal populations in order to allow signal discrimination. Differential
stimulation of receptors, therefore, would activate different groups of neurons with distinct
response patterns. To determine whether this is the case, it would be necessary to characterize
the different leg receptors, and determine which are recruited to respond at each applied
frequency
It was interesting to note that none of the data analysis techniques pursued in this
experiment demonstrated sensor responsiveness to vibration frequencies above 500 Hz. The
normalized frequency response analysis actually indicated a significant decrease in nerve firing
rate in response to the 1000 Hz stimulus level (Fig. 7). While this prevents a confident claim of
responsiveness at greater frequencies, it seems premature to conclude that they do not lie within
receptor sensitivity range. Related arthropods, such as the fiddler crab and the cricket (Aicher
and Tautz 1983; Dusenbery 1992), have been demonstrated to respond to stimuli intensity up to
2 kHz. The decrease in firing observed in the Pachygrapsis leg nerve at these higher rates,
therefore, may in fact be a form of sensory encoding through different neuronal response
patterns. Aicher and Tautz found that the spontaneous activity of one of the fiddler crab leg
nerve units was increasingly suppressed by the application of higher frequency stimuli. This
inhibition was postulated to help in discrimination between low frequency communicational
signals and high frequency background noise. Although vibrational communication is not an
obvious behavioral characteristic of Pachygrapsis, inhibition could still play a role in signal
discrimination in their natural habitat. Inhibition of this kind could easily account for the
decrease in normalized response seen with the application of high frequency stimuli.
Determining whether inhibition is a method of response would potentially allow more complete
characterization of the vibration sensitivity range of the crab. Doing so, however, would require
recording from individual neuronal fibers within the leg nerve to determine their distinct
response characteristics which was beyond the scope of this particular experiment.
Conclusions:
This experiment made substantial strides in characterizing the frequency sensitivity range
of the lined purple shore crab. Threshold sensitivity to high-frequency stimuli was determined,
and responsiveness was demonstrated within a vibrational stimulus range of 10-500 Hz. The
next critical step in a sensory ecology based analysis, is to move into the field and determine the
vibrational stimuli naturally present in the animal’s informational channel. This would allow a
clearer characterization of the role played by vibrational signals in ensuring the species' fitness.
It would also allow a calculation of anthropogenic noise sources that could interfere with this
sensitivity window and therefore disrupt the species' ability to relate maximally to its
environment.
