Materials and Methods
Vertical Distributions
In order to determine the relative distributions and abundances of Tegula
funebralis and T. brunnea at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, two
vertical transects were set up perpendicular to the shoreline during minus tides. Twelve
distances along each transect were chosen from a list of random numbers and a .25 m2
quadrat was sampled for both species at each selected point. Heights above mean lower
low water were visually estimated, then selected points were measured with a surveyor's
level and the estimated heights adjusted accordingly.
Desiccation Experiments
To test how T. brunnea is able to withstand desiccation pressures compared to T.
funebralis, snails of both species were exposed to air for various lengths of time, and
mortality rates compared. First, snails of each species were divided into three size classes
Small snails were approximately 1.0-1.6 cm in maximum shell diameter, while medium
and large snails were -1.7-1.9 cm and -2.0-2.3 cm respectively. Snails were then placed in
shallow, 10 cm diameter, glass bowls according to species and size (48 bowls total, 24
bowls for each species, 8 for each size class within species). In order to keep the overall
biomass in each bowl constant, the bowls with large snails contained fewer individuals
(4-5) than the bowls with medium snails (5-6) and the bowls with small snails (7). All the
bowls were placed in direct sunlight outdoors on a partly cloudy day. Due to rain, the
bowls were moved inside after 5.5 hours and placed in front of a fan for the remainder of
the experiment. The room stayed at approximately 17Â°C while the fan provided wind to
mimic the outside environment.
At 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after exposure began, two bowls for each species and size
class were covered with a shade cloth (to prevent snails from crawling out of their bowls'
