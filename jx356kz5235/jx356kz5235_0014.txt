Zonation of Tegula
Conclusions
Tegula brunnea seems to be limited to low intertidal regions due to its inability to
tolerate heat and desiccation. In contrast, the lack of a simple explanation for 1.
funebralis's lower limit indicates that the snail’s zonation patterns might be the effects of
a complex combination of factors rather than the action of a single strong factor.
Predation does not seem to be a strong force at Hopkins Marine Station, but because this
finding contradicts all previous study, it should be investigated further. Competition is
probably not occurring, as evidenced by the low densities of both snails in the zone of
overlap. The climbing behavior observed in T. funebralis, while seemingly complex,
may be an important reason why T. funebralis does not attempt to live down lower in
the intertidal. This behavior should be investigated to elucidate its origins. Microhabitat
choice and differential larval settlement may prove to be important factors causing the
zonation patterns of the intertidal Tegula species. Finally, it is possible that adaptations
caused by past selective pressures are contributing to the zonation of Tegula, making the
causes of the zonation difficult to elucidate.
T. funebralis demonstrates that the biotic interactions maintaining a species’ lower
limit in the intertidal zone may be more complex than just strong predation or
competition. Life history factors, simple lifestyle preferences, complex behaviors, or à
combination of factors may contribute to the observed distributions of organisms in the
field.
