Zonation of Tegula
Monique Rocca
The types of algal cover were: no cover, low cover (Endocladia, Gigartina leptorhynchos),
encrusting coraline algae, Gastroclonium, dense cover (lridea, Prionitis, Mastocarpus),
and a blade of Gigartina corymbifera). The microhabitats were approximately of equal
area. The spaces between rocks were filled with sand to keep snails off the bottom of the
tank. Twenty-five individuals of each species of snail were placed in the tank. Daily, the
number of snails of each species in each microhabitat was counted. Also counted were
the number of snails on the sand, on the walls of the tank, or missing. (Closer
examination determined that missing snails were hiding on the bare undersides of the
rocks.)
Results
Distributions
The lower limit of Tegula funebralis was approximately 0 ft. above MLLW, while
the upper limit of T. brunnea was approximately 2 ft. above MLLW (Fig. 2). Snail
densities in the zone of overlap were low (1-2 snails of each species per quadrat)
compared to the areas of maximum T. funebralis density (40-60 snails per quadrat).
Desiccation Experiments
In the first experiment, all the T. brunnea died within 6 hours of exposure while
no T. funebralis individuals died before 12 hours of exposure; some T. funebralis
survived 48 hours of exposure (Fig. 3). There were no significant differences between
size classes, but the species X time interaction is significant (Table 1). Further analysis
with a Tukey (HSD) Test reveals that the differences in mortality rates between species
are significant for each time interval. However, the differences between the mortality
rates for different time intervals within each species are not, except for the difference
between 6 and 12 hours, and 6 and 24 hours, for T. funebralis.
