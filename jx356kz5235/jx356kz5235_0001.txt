Zonation of Tegula
Monique Rocca
Abstract
The two intertidal species of Tegula, T. funebralis and T. brunnea show distinct
vertical zonation patterns. T. funebralis is found throughout the mid intertidal zone anc
into the low zone, while T. brunnea is found in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal
zones. Experiments were conducted to test whether desiccation, predation, or
microhabitat preferences were affecting the distributions of the two species. Results
indicate that the inability to tolerate prolonged exposure to heat and desiccation keeps T.
brunnea low in the intertidal zone. The predators Pisaster ochraceous and Cancer
antenarius, which live low intertidally, were not shown to preferentially eat T. funebrali
in the lab or the field. Predation pressures on both species were shown to be low at
Hopkins Marine Station, suggesting that predation was not a major force maintaining
the lower limit of T. funebralis. Microhabitat preferences of the two species differ,
indicating that microhabitat choice may play a role in maintaining zonation patterns.
The role of other factors such as competition, behavior, and larval settlement are
discussed.
