Zonation of Tegula

cover. More research would be of value to determine whether microhabitat choice
affects the zonation of Tegula.
Other possible factors
The fact that densities of both species are low compared to the centers of their
ranges suggests that interspecific competition may not be affecting zonation patterns. It
would be unlikely that snails are experiencing interspecific competition pressures in an
area of such low density when they can tolerate intraspecific densities of up to 50
snails/.25 m2. Furthermore, Underwood (1978) demonstrates that interspecific
competition between mobile species usually does not result in the exclusion of the
competitively inferior. In addition, Watanabe (1984b) has shown that between T.
brunnea and two other subtidal Tegula species, interspecific competition is no higher
than intraspecific competition. It is probable that these results extend to the relationship
between 1. funebralis and T. brunnea. Competition between Tegula and other grazers is
also unlikely because Tegula is much more abundant then other potential competitors
(Watanabe 1984b).
Another factor that might affect the distributions of intertidal Tegula is differential
larval settlement. One might tend to find adults in the same areas that the juveniles
settle. Watanabe (1984b) found that larval recruitment is an important cause of the
spatial segregation of the three subtidal Tegula species. Further, it is known that T.
brunnea larvae settle in the low intertidal/shallow subtidal zone (Watanabe 1984b) while
the larvae of T. funebralis settle high in the intertidal zone (Paine 1969). It therefore
appears that larval settlement is, at least in part, affecting the zonation patterns of adult
Tegula. Why the differences evolved, however, has yet to be elucidated.
