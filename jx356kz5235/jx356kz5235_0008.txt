Zonation of Tegula
Monique Rocca
For the second desiccation experiment, all the snails survived except for three
large snails, one that was exposed for 12 hours and two that were exposed for 24 hours.
Because of the low mortality rate, these results were not analyzed quantitatively.
Predation experiments
In all trials except for Cancer 2, T. brunnea was eaten more often than T. funebralis
(Table 2). However, the predators were only significantly biased eaters in the Pisaster 2
and Cancer 1 trials.
Tethering experiments
Twenty-seven percent of the total number of snails escaped their tethers as
evidenced by strings with no knot at the end (Table 3). At the high station where no
natural population of Tegula exists, all 10 snails escaped. Of the remaining snails,
mortality was low (Fig. 4). Therefore, the ANOVA was run comparing the number dead
for each height and species, regardless of cause of death. None of the differences were
statistically significant (Table 4).
Microhabitat experiment
As evidenced by the lack of overlap of the 95% confidence intervals, significantly
more 1. funebralis than T. brunneu were found on the rocks with thin or no algal cover.
i.e.. the no cover, low cover, missing, and encrusting coraline algae microhabitats (Fig. 5).
However, the numbers of T. brunnen on rocks with thick algal cover (dense cover,
Gastroclonium) were not significantly different than the numbers of T. funebralis.
Th√®re were significantly more T. brunnea than T. funebralis on the sand and the walls of
the tank.
