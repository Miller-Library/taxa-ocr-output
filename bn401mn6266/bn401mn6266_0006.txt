Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
Twenty to 55 ml were injected into one of the two lateral cutaneous veins
(above and below the lateral cutaneous artery), filling both vessels (figure 3).
Complete fills of these veins gave a good venous injection of the muscle rete
below them, descending all the way to the base of the red muscle against the
visceral cavity wall (figures 6, 7).
ï»¿D. Sub-renal Rete (Arterial)
Injecting 20 to 40 ml into one of the two lower lateral cutaneous arteries
would generally fill both vessels with injectant, as they converge (figure 3).
These vessels were found by skinning below the lateral cutaneous artery, at
approximately the line of countershading, where dark gray turns to ventral
ecru. The lower lateral cutaneous arteries arise and diverge into two vessels at
the level of mid-scapula, just behind the gills. A complete fill of these arteries
ensures a fill of the kidney rete's arterial vessels.
E. Sub-renal Rete (Venous)
An average of 20 ml was injected into the lower lateral cutaneous veins, which
lie below each of the lower lateral cutaneous arteries, when these veins weren't
filled by the injection of the upper lateral cutaneous veins. The injection of
these vessels is mandatory if venous injection of the kidney rete is desired.
More injectant would have been needed for a full venous fill of the kidney
rete.
Suprahepatic Rete (Arterial)
The pericardial arteries, found in the dorsal wall of the pericardial cavity, just
under the heart, were injected, 50 to 70 ml in each in order to fill the minute
arterial system of each lobe of the suprahepatic rete (figures 8, 9). An incision
was made at the ventral side of the pectoral girdle, down the ventral midline
of the shark (about level with the pectoral fins), and the coracoid bar cartilage
was severed to reveal the pericardial cavity. Generally, it was necessary to
