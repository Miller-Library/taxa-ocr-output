Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
L. ditropis heart to body-mass ratios appear higher than those found for I.
oxyrinchus in Carey et al., 1985. L. ditropis ratios ranged from 0.32% to 0.42%,
whereas mako values clustered between 0.14% and 0.20% (figure 16). L. ditropis
heart to total-mass ratios follow a linear regression with a closeness of r2 - 0.998
(figure 17)
In accordance with Carey et al., 1985, findings for the mako, visceral mass and
suprahepatic rete mass in the salmon shark may increase exponentially with
increases in total body mass, with closeness of fit values of 0.995 and 0.852,
respectively (figures 18 and 19). But L. ditropis values cluster well above would-be
lines of regression for Carey's mako data, indicating a much greater relative size of
the suprahepatic retial tissue with respect to both total mass and visceral mass in
the salmon shark. Only in viscera to total-mass ratios do the mako and salmon
shark cluster together, indicating that visceral masses in the salmon shark are
consistent with those of other members of its family (figure 16).
The vessels of the arterial portion of this rete are among the smallest of any
retial vessels in the body, as shown in figure 20. Mean diameters and their standard
errors (figure 21) ranged from 0.1117 + 0.008 to 0.0773 +0.005 mm, for our largest
and smallest sharks, respectively.
Arterial vessels of the suprahepatic rete are structurally distinct from those of
the lateral muscle rete. As shown in figure 9, vessels divide, coalesce, and redivide
multiple times, creating a honeycomb-like appearance. Venous blood is supplied in
a large sinus encompassing each of the lobes of the rete.
Sub-renal Retia
The arterial vessels of the kidney rete also divide and converge, only to divide
again, in a fashion similar to that of the suprahepatic rete (figure 13). Unlike the
suprahepatic, the venous supply to the kidney rete is not a simple sinus feeding
