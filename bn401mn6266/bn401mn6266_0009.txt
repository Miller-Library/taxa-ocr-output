Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
approximately 8 to 10 vessels of each type, with the venous vessels generally
encircling the arterial.
The trapezoidal area of the muscle rete (measured in cross-sections of muscle
tissue) is a result of vessels being closely packed near the surface, but branching and
spacing as they extend through the white muscle. Increased retial area occurs with
increases in the total length of the shark, with the greatest mean retial area (12.136
+ 3.59 cm2) being found in the largest shark, LD2, followed by 10.775 + 3.93 cm2 of
muscle rete per cross section in LD1, our next smallest specimen, and 6.77 + 0.23
cm2 in the yearling LD4 (table 2). Area increases are the result of increased
branching of vessels as they diverge from the densest portion of the rete nearest the
skin and extend toward the internalized red muscle. Venous vessels extend from the
visceral side of the red muscle all the way to the lateral cutaneous veins (figure 7,
with internal vessel diameters of these lateral veins ranging from 3.0 to 5.5 mm in
our three specimens (table 1). The mean vessel diameters of the retia associated
with these lateral veins range from 0.10 mm to 0.12 mm in diameter, + 0.032 (table
4). The diameters of muscle-rete vessels tend to increase with increasing body mass
(figure 14).
Suprahepatic Retia
Ratios of suprahepatic retia to mass of viscera appear consistent with
measurements found by Carey et al., 1985, for L. ditropis . His values, 0.0279 and
0.0536, lie within close range of our calculated ratios, 0.031, 0.033, and 0.06 (table
3). The mass of the suprahepatic rete in L. ditropis appears to be a linear function
of visceral mass (figure 15), fitting its line of regression with an r2 closeness of fit
value of 0.954. This linear relation echoes Carey et al., 1985, data for mako shark
Isurus oxyrinchus, another member of the lamnid family.
