ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Excessive thanks are in order for my advisor, Barbara Block, for her countless hours of
assistance, inspiration, and energy—never was she too busy to come see the wonders
we’d found over at the TRCC, and for remembering her spring quarter 97 shark
mommies when further research opportunities present themselves in Alaska, etc.;
Chuck Farwell, whose supportive words of praise kept us thinking we were doing
important work, as well as for his incredible trust in loaning us his camera for the
entire quarter, despite his fears of our covering it in blood and gore; to Tom

our link to the elasmobranch internet network, as well as teaching us the art of

the natural history of the lamnid shark; to my research partner, Victor Tubbesing
for his patience, dedication, and words of warning when my scalpel seemed to be
cutting too deep; to Ellen Freund for her humor and interest in our project, and for
making us feel welcome as a part of the Block lab and for going through the trauma
of proof-reading this paper; to Heidi Dewar, for her consistently thought-provoking
physiological questions and willingness to explain basic fish anatomy to the
icthyologically-impaired, and for her flattering interest in our progress; to Doug
Fudge, for his tolerance with the smells and mess we created in his TRCC domain.
and his prompt ordering of supplies we needed "by tomorrow," as well as his
interesting questions he tried to pass off as answers to our questions in such a
teacher-like fashion; to Dave Marcinek, for obtaining the sharks for us so that our
