Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
excise the atrium and ventricle just anterior to the muscular conus arteriosus
in order to get enough access to the pericardials for injection.
G.
Suprahepatic Rete (Venous)
Venous feed of the suprahepatic rete arises from the hepatic sinus, which lies
within the posterior pericardial cavity and fills the venous sinus bathing the
arterial retia vessels. Via this sinus, the venous portion of the hepatic rete
may be filled. Approximately 90 ml of injectant may be necessary, as
multiple sinuses are found in this area, and all are inter-connected (figure 8).
Caution must be taken not to pierce the liver lobes: if pierced, squalene oil
will leak at a rapid rate.
H. Red Muscle Vein
The red muscle vein—found by steaking at approximately 38% of body length,
or just behind insertion of dorsal fin, and searching the region of the red
muscle lying closest to the visceral wall—was injected with between 20 and 40
ml of blue silicon. This produced a satisfactory venous fill of the cranium and
orbital retia.
After we were confident that our injections had had sufficient time to set, we
began dissection. Careful skinning revealed both of the lateral vessel systems,
including the lateral cutaneous artery and the two veins surrounding it, and the
lower lateral cutaneous arteries and the vein below each (figure 3). This allowed us
to confirm that the retia had been successfully injected before vessels feeding them
were severed in further dissection. Using calipers, internal vessel diameters were
taken of all lateral vessels (table 1).
Steaking of the lateral muscle tissue, from posterior to anterior, followed. We
took careful note of distance from the caudal fork so that accurate red-muscle¬
placement calculations could be made. Development of the lateral muscle retia
