Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
Injections generally required two or more people, and accidents such as
bursting of the balloon of the sphygmomanometer or severing of the catheter tubing
at sites where it had been epoxied did occur, releasing injection compounds at high
pressures. Thus the need for safety goggles and protective clothing was
demonstrated.
Gel-time for Microfil, timed from the moment that curing agent is added to
the mixture, is 20 minutes (i.e., the compound had set to the point of being
uninjectable through the syringe in approximately 20 minutes). The compound was
generally allowed 2 hours to set up completely after being injected into a vessel
before further dissection was undertaken.
Microfil-injected vessels and retia could be sliced easily with scalpels and/or
knives, and injected tissues could be frozen or fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formalin without altering the injectant.
Alternative Injection Compounds
Although Microfil-MV was the injection compound of choice, two other
compounds were tested.
Bateson's 17
Bateson’s 17, a methylmethacrylate corrosion casting compound, was used to
inject both lobes of the suprahepatic rete in LD1. A mixture of Bateson's monomer:
catalyst B: promoter C: methylmethacrylate in the ratio 50: 10: 1: 50, plus a small
amount of either blue or red pigment, was injected, following the injection
procedure outlined above. However, Bateson's 17 produces more dangerous fumes
and should be restricted to well-ventilated areas. Working time for Bateson's was
approximately 30 minutes; set time approximately 2 hours.
Casts created with Bateson's were excised from the specimen and placed in 6%
potassium hydroxide (KÖH) to corrode the tissue surrounding the injected vessels
