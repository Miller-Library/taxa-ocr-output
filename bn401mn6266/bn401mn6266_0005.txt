Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
and tissue was allowed to macerate for several days. KOH solution was replaced
with fresh approximately once a day. Casts were eventually stored in 50% ethanol.
CP-101
A new cast-corrosion product made by Flow Tech, Inc. was tested in the
ventral right lobe of the suprahepatic rete in LD2. CP-101 compound was mixed
with stannous octoate and ethyl silicate in ratios 20: 1: 1. However, we found that
when corrosion was attempted in 10% KOH solution (reduced from the
recommended 20-35% solution), the solution began to macerate the compound itself
after 2 days, while the cast was still not cleared of tissue. The cast disintegrated and
was unusable.
Retia Injected
Retia were injected in the following approximate order:
A. Orbital Rete
Eight to 15 ml, scaled to size of specimen, were injected into the
pseudobranchial artery, which extends laterally over hyomandibular cartilage,
between this cartilage and the jaw bone within the head.
B. Lateral Muscle Rete (Arterial)
Thirty to 70 ml were injected into the lateral cutaneous artery as anteriorly as
possible, ideally making the injection incision in the artery just as it arises
from the third gill arch, just above the level of the dorsal-most portion of the
third gill slit (figures 2 and 3). Complete injections filled the arterial portion
of the muscle rete, which derives from the posterior side of the artery and
courses through the white muscle (figure 4). Bundles of retial vessels
alternate with white muscle fibers, forming bands (figure 5).
C. Lateral Muscle Rete (Venous)
