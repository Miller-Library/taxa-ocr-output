Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
ABSTRACT
The Pacific salmon shark, Lamna ditropis (Hubbs & Follett, 1947), can maintain core
body temperatures 7 to 11°C above ambient waters—the highest body-temperature
elevation of any shark measured to date. Gross anatomical studies of three subjects
revealed that the mechanism for such endothermy is facilitated by counter-current
heat exchangers common in other lamnids and scombrids. In these fish, retia
mirabilia—"wonderful nets" of interwoven vessels and/or sinuses—act as metabolic
heat recyclers. L. ditropis possesses four retial systems, three of which serve the
viscera and muscle, much like the retia of its Atlantic cousin, the porbeagle shark,
Lamna nasus. The lateral cutaneous rete begins laterally in the white muscle and
serves the well-insulated internal red muscle. This tubular rete, composed of
bundles of arteries and veins, is small in area near the skin, but divides and widens
as it nears the internal red muscle. The viscera is warmed by the supra-hepatic rete,
a two-lobed tissue lying posterior to the heart and dorsal to the liver lobes. Minute
arteries repeatedly converge and coalesce in this rete in a honeycomb pattern, and
the entire arterial mass is contained in a large venous sinus. The sub-renal rete
consists of a small anterior retial lobe plus its lateral extension, which runs the
length of the kidney, conserving metabolic heat created there. We propose that the
combined efficiency of these retial systems allows L. ditropis to occupy its icy niche,
the most polar of any shark.
INTRODUCTION
Due to the extremely limited number of salmon sharks obtained for scientific
research, L. ditropis is as yet virtually uncharacterized. Knowledge of the salmon
shark has been mere supposition, and the consensus has been that its anatomy and
