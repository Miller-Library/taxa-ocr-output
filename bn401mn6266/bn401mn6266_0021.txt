Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
Figure 16: Plots L. ditropis data (open dots in red) on plots for I. oxyrinchus
(Carey et al., 1985), demonstrating the clustering of data for L. ditropis consistently
above would-be lines of regression for the Careyâ€™s mako data with the exception of
viscera: body weight, where L. ditropis clusters with I. oxyrinchus, indicating a
similar relative visceral size in makos and salmon sharks. L. ditropis data is further
analyzed in figures 15, 17, 18, and 19.
Figure 17: Shows the linear relation (r2 = 0.998) of heart mass to total body mass
in L. ditropis.
Figures 18: Demonstrates the exponential (r2= 0.995) increase in visceral mass
with body mass, both in kilograms.
Figure 19: The mass of the suprahepatic rete may increase exponentially with
increases in total body mass (r2=0.852)
Figure 20: A comparison of vessel diameters among three retia, clustered according
to specimen. Note that largest vessel diameters are found in the kidney retia,
whereas vessel diameters of muscle and suprahepatic retia appear similar within the
same shark. Error bars indicate standard error, calculated via sample size (n) values
enumerated in figures 14, 21, and 22.
Figure 21: Mean vessel diameters of the suprahepatic retia, compared over three
specimens. Error bars indicate standard error from the mean vessel diameter,
namely, 0.1117 + 0.0055, 0.1682 + 0.0072, and 0.0773 + 0.0064 mm. N values
listed indicate sample size of vessel diameters measured for the calculation of
standard error.
Figure 22: Mean sub-renal retia vessel diameters, compared in two specimens.
Note that no measurements were possible in LD1, as our injection compound failed
to set up. Error bars denote standard error, calculated via the sample size n of
vessels measured using optical micrometry shown above each bar. Exact values are
0.31427 + 0.0115 (LD2) and 0.1554 + 0.0072 (LD3).
