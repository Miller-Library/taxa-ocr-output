Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
could be seen in steak progressions, and muscle rete areas were measured (table 2).
Steaks were labeled and either frozen or fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin.
Excision of the visceral organs was necessary once the viscera had been exposed
in steaking. The stomach was emptied, and the heart, liver, gall bladder, pylorus,
pancreas, spleen, spiral valve, and rectal gland were weighed individually using an
Ohaus balance (table 3). The suprahepatic rete was usually excised last, both lobes
at once.
The kidney could be found by first removing the claspers (in the case of the
male) and anal fins, and then finding where the lower lateral cutaneous arteries (at
the level of the cloaca) converged into the cloacal arteries and turned sharply
toward the ventral midline (figure 10). Just under the ureter, these cloacal arteries
enter the posterior lobe of the sub-renal rete (figure 11 ), which comprises the
posterior-most point of the kidney on the ventral side. The entire kidney was
generally excised for weighing and study of the rete (f igure 12).
After weights were taken, a razor blade was used to make retial sections of the
suprahepatic retial tissue (figure 9), and of the posterior lobe of the sub-renal rete
(figure 13) and the muscle rete (figure 4), to be viewed under the dissecting scope.
Optical micrometry measurements of vessel diameters were taken on a Leica MZ8
stereomicroscope, with a 6x Ernst Leitz Wetzlar ocular micrometer, under variable
magnification.
RESULTS
Muscle Retia
The lateral cutaneous rete consists of bundles of vessels, both venous and
arterial, intermingled, which extend throughout the white muscle toward the red
muscle which lies adjacent to the visceral cavity. Each bundle consists of
