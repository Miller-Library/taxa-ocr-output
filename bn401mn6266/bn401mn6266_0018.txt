Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
LD2. Heart of LDI weighed only in its entirety, atrium and ventricle together. Aorta
mass in LD2 reflects organ weight while still blood-filled.
Note that ratio of suprahepatic rete mass to viscera served is consistent in LDI and
LD2, in both of which rete was injected before weighing. Ratio seems to increase
when rete was uninjected in LD4, possibly due to blood remaining within sinus of
the rete, which was rinsed or displaced in injected retia.
Table 4: Mean vessel diameters, + their standard deviation from the mean, for
each of the three retia in each of three specimens. Sub-renal vessels from LDI were
never measured due to injection compound difficulties.
