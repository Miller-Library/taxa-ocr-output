Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
Silicon Injection
Segments of Intramedic polyethylene catheter tubing (ID 0.76, OD 1.2 mm)
and Alpha Wire Corporation PVC tubing, size codes PV 105 17 and 105 18,
previously cut at differing lengths, were epoxied together using Duro Master Mend
Epoxy, Extra Strength Quick Set. A Cole-Parmer three-way stop-cock was epoxied to
the catheter tubing of largest diameter. Once catheters were readied (generally the
epoxy was allowed to dry for several hours), small "windows" were skinned from the
well-iced specimen using stainless steel surgical blades (Feather, no. 10 and Schein,
no. 22) to expose vessels of interest. A small incision was made in the vessel, the
catheter-syringe hook-up was inserted into the vessel through the incision, and the
vessel was rinsed with sea water to clear it of blood and test it for knicks and leaks
before injecting with a silicon. Microfil^-brand injection compound, a radiopaque
silicon rubber made by FlowTech, Inc. of Carver, Massachusetts, was prepared in
desired volumes by mixing MV-color: MV-dilutent: MV-curing agent in ratios of 5: 4:
0.45. Red-dyed silicon denoted arterial vessels, and blue, venous.
Ã„fter rinsing the vessels with sea water, a catheter was fed several inches down
the vessel past the point of incision, and surgical suture was tied in a loose knot (or
a hemostat was held with light pressure) to seal off the vessel incision to prevent
backflow. As someone stood ready with extra hemostats and gauze to clip off any
leaky vessels in the injection vicinity, another began to apply hand pressure to the
Microfil-filled syringe or to pump the attached sphygmomanometer up to
physiological pressures of between 30 and 80 mmHg (i.e., between 4.00 and 10.67
kPa). Injection proceeded until back-pressure was too great for the injector to force
any more compound from the syringe, or until the entire prepared volume of
Microfil was injected.
