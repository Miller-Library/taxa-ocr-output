Condie: Retia in L. ditropis
endothermy are probably similar to that of other members of its family, Lamnidae.
Its closest relative and the only other member of its genus, the porbeagle shark,
Lamna nasus, is a North Atlantic species of similar external morphology and known
high levels of endothermy reaching 11°C above ambient (Carey & Teal, 1969). Yet
supposition seems inadequate in the realm of science.
A single published paper (Carey, 1985) exists describing the endothermic
characteristics of L. ditropis. No descriptive anatomical work was done, and only
two of the shark's four retial systems were even mentioned. Using the descriptive
work of Burne, Some Peculiarities of the Blood-Vascular System of the Porbeagle Shark
Lamna cornubica, published in 1923, as our guide to the general anatomy of a
lamnid shark, we set out to outline the circulation and retial systems of L. ditropis:
the orbital, lateral cutaneous, suprahepatic, and sub-renal retia mirabilia (figure 1).
We found a similar, yet even more impressive, system than that which Burne
described 70 years ago, as more detail could be seen with new tools and techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection
Two of the three Lamna ditropis specimens (LDI and LD2) were obtained from
local fishermen from Monterey Fish Company and stored whole at -20°C. The third
specimen, LD4, was found beached near Moss Landing, California, and stored at
-20°C. Careful morphometrics were taken, using straight rather than curved
measurements. Specimens were thawed individually for approximately 24 hours
before dissection.
