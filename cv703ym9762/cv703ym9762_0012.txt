III. Laboratory Work
B. Results and Discussion
The results of the laboratory experiments appear in figures 10, 11,
12, and 13. The temperature in or near each container at the times of
maximal activity appears at the top of the graphs. The darkened bar
represents fime spent in the particular tmperature regime. The findings
are summarized in table 4 and figure 14. A temperature response curve
for collembolid activity is shown in figure 15.
In all containers maximum activity during the first 24 hours occurs
between 5:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. on May 25. (This peak of maximum
activity will be referred to as the "A" peak.) Also in each case, a
smaller activity peak (designated peak "B") occurs approximately 11
hours previous to peak A. These results are consistent with work done
by McSpadden (1978 ) and support the conclusion that collembolid
activity is, in part, controlled by an endogenous temporal program.
McSpadden's work suggests that peak B might be a tidal component of a
circadian clock, the A peak being the principal element of a circadian
rhythm.
In the containers placed in the heated water bath activity decreases
to a very low level and does not reappear when the containers are returned
to ambient laboratory conditions on the third day. This suggests that
within this temperature range (28.8- 34.0 degrees centigrade) mortality
is high. Maximum activity in the control container (placed in an
insulated regime on the second day ) and in the container placed in the
formatemp was confined to the early morning "gate" throughout the course
of the experiment. This pattern of activity is consistent with MeSpadden's
