A. Materials and Methods
Collembolids were collected between 5:00 A.M. and 8:00 A.M. on
May 24 near station 18. Plastic trays and coffee cans were sunk in the
sand with an inch or so of seawater in the bottoms. A virtual monolayer
of collembolids formed on the water surface, and the containers were
brought into the laboratory. Using a mouth aspirator, collembolids
were concentrated in a small jar from where they were spooned into six
Tuperware containers painted flat bl√•ck to simulate constant dark conditions.
Infared diodes were positioned in the containers in a manner diagrammed
in figure 9. The light detecting diodes were wired to amplifying circuitry
(designed by Robin Burnett and built by me ) which then signalled a
channel on an EstralineAngus event recorder, thus, activity, as defined
by a partial interruption of the infared beam, was continuously recorded,
In analyzing the data, the marks on the Estraline Angus chart were
counted in hourly segments. Comparison of maximum activity for the
different containers was obtained by combining the counts from three
consecutive periods of highest activity.
The containers with the collembolids ran for 24 hours in ambient
laboratory conditions in order to establish relative numbers for latter
comparisons of containers. A Rustrak temperature recording device monitored
laboratory temperature. At 9:00 A.M. on May 25 the six containers were
removed from ambient laboratory conditions and were placed in four different
temperature regimes. Two containers were placed in a heated water bath,
one container was placed in an insulated container subject to laboratory
temperature (control ), two containers were placed in a 12.3 degree
centigrade formatemp bath and one container was placed in a styrafoam
