VI. Acknowledgement:
I would like to thank Michelle McSpadden for helping collect the
field data and for sharing her findings with me. Judy Thompson and
Susan Harris provided mental relief that enabled me to relax when time
had run out. Consultations with Chuck Baxter were instructive even
though they cost me several sixers. Dr. Donald Abbott was an inspiration
and his incredible enthusiasm was a spiritual amphetamine to me during
the pre-dawn hours. The most superlative thanks to Robin Burnett whose
time and advice made this work possible. The lost sleep will never be
missed.
