Figure 15- A graph of the response of collembolid activity to changes
in temperatures. On the y axis the percent change in
activity from activity shown under ambient laboratory
temperatures is shown. On thex axis the temperature
of the regime to which the collembolids were moved from
the ambient laboratory conditions is shown. The hashed
line is drawn to represent the temperature response
curve of collembolids to the different regimes.
