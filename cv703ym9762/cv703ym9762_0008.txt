slight peak (slight in comparison to the major peak, but still representing
hundreds of animals ) of activity at 3:30 A.M. or 4:30 A.M., again
suggesting some bimodality in activity.
Examination of temperatures for the study periods reveals that for
study periods 2 and 3 temperatures were in the same range, approximately
10 degrees centigrade during collections, however, the amount of activity
was not similar. Study period 1 and study period 3 both had maximum
activity near an early morning low tide, but temperatures were generally
higher for study period 1 (approximately 17 degree centigrade at
maximum activity ) and activity was much lower during this period as
compared to study period 3. This suggests that temperature might be
affecting the amount of activity. Low tides for periods 1 and 3 occur
nearly two hours apart, yet activity is maximum for both periods about
the same time, 7:30 A.M. This suggests that temperature, while possibly
affecting the amount of activity, does not affect its timing. Again,
examining data from study periods 1 and 3, the occurrence of some
activity before the 7:30 A.M. peak is more prominent in study period 1,
again being correlated with slightly higher temperatures in this period.
In both cases, with an early moning low tide a small peak of activity;
occurs on an outgoing tide and preceedsa peak of greater activity.
Other environmental conditions also seemd to effect jumping behavior.
Periods of winds resulted in very low activity (usually non-existent)
of collembolids at any time of day or night. Humidity seemed to have
an effect as well. On a rainy afternoon collembolids were observed to
be active in numbers which had only been found in early morning periods.
Foggy mornings seemed to bring collembolids out in the greatest numbers,
but quantitive data on this is lacking.
