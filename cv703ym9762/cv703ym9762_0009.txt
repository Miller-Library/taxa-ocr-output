The apparent positive effect that low temperatures have on jumping
activity in the collembolid population studied and the lack of temperature
effect on the timing of maximum jumping activity suggest the presence
of an endogenous cuing mechanism in collembolid jumping activity.
Work performed by Michelle McSpadden (1978 ) revealed the presence of
such a mechanism, and laboratory work was initiated to investigate the
effect of temperature on both the amount of activity and the timing of
activity.
