II. Field Work
A. Materials and Methods
A pocket beach near Mussel Point, California was chosen as a study
area for field investigation of collembolid jumping activity. A matrix
system of hollow metal rods driven into the sand was laid out for
reference in collecting animals (figure 1 ). Station numbers were
assigned to the rods indicating meters away from a reference post
located at the margin of the beach and the land vegetation.
Traps were set out at regular time intervals during five field
studies. The setting of traps proceeded as such: a three centimeter
square of graph paper divided into one-tenth centimeter units was
placed inside a 4.5 centimeter diameter jar lid (figure 2 ). One
large drop of Mobil 10W-40 oil was spread over the entire surface of
the lid, fully coating both the graph paper and the lid surface. The
lids were placed approximately two meters away from one another at
specific station sites for two minutes. To one side of the stations
samples were designated "A", to the other side they were designated "B",
When two lids were placed side by side for replicate samples they were
labeled Al and A2 or Bl and B2. After the two minute interval, the lids
were collected, brought into the laboratory, and surveyed under a dissecting
scope for collembolids sticking in the oil. The counting methodology
was such that all animals falling onto the graph paper and onto the white
surface of the lid were counted unless there were more than about 300
specimens in which case four random square centimeters on the graph paper
were counted and multiplied by pi (2.25)4 to estimate the total number
on the lid surface.
