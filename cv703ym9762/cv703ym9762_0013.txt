work. The A/B ratio in the control container increasesfrom 2.5 the first
day to 4.2 on the second day, possible the result of slightly warmer
temperature in the insulated container. On the third and fourth days
the ratio returns to approximately the value it was the first day.
The overall amount of activity in this container decreases as a function
of time, probably the result of mortality and escape.
In the two containers placed in the formatemp bath activity increases
on the second day by approximately 170% and 330% (peak A ). The
timing of the A peak does not seem to be affected, that is, maximum
activity still occurs in the early morning period. Also in this
temperature regime, the A/B ratio increases significantly from its
first day value, and a return of the containers to ambient condtions
results in an eventual return of this ratio to approximately its first
day value. The increase of the A/B ratio on the second day is due to
peak A increasing nearly 5 times as much as peak B.
The container placed in the blue ice box exhibited a 25% decrease
in activity in this regime as compared to activity during the first day
of ambient laboratory conditions. Once again, the timing of the A peak
does not appear to be affected in this cold regime (May 25 ). The
A/B ratio increases from 4.5 the first day to 12.8 the second day, with
A increasing more than B. The unusual occurrence of exaggerated
bimodality on the third day with a decrease in the A/B ratio to 1.3
could have several explanations. The cold conditions could have effected
the metabolism of the collembolids such that upon reaching the first
permissive point in their activity cycle, point B, they become more
active than before. Another possible explanation is that the return
to ambient conditions from a cold regime has affected the clock mechanism
