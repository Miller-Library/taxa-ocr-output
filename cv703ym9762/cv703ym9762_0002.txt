I. Introduction
Emphasis on physiological adaptation as an evolutionary strategy
has often overshadowed consideration of behavior as a means of adaptation.
Adaptation, in either sense, is concerned with an organism's ability
to exploit best a particular environmental niche. The marine collembolids,
commonly called springtails, have adapted to survive in a biologically
harsh environment and are one of the few macroscopic inhabitants of
sandy beaches in central California. Marine collembolids are limited
to this environment, and their delicate nature seems paradoxical in
this context; able to survive the severe environmental conditions of
sandy beaches, wind, temperature fluctuation, wave action, et cetera,
collembolids desiccate within minutes of being removed from a humid
environment. Even more difficult to explain is the behavior of jumping
which is characteristic of many collembolids found on central California
beaches. These collembolids have a jumping organ, the furculata, which
allows them to spring into the air. The adaptive significance of
jumping behavior is unclear. While Davenport (1903 ) suggests that
jumping aids respiration, there is no published work on this to date.
In the case of marine collembolids it is evident that the timing of such
hehavior must be closely regulatedâ€” jumping at inopportune times, such
as during high tide or midday, would be disasterous. No literature
deals with rhythmic patterns of collembolid jumping activity, but field
work conducted by Hopkins Marine Station students (spring, 1978) on a
beach near Mussel Point in Pacific Grove, California suggested the
presence of a temporal pattern of fluctuating jumping activity in the
collembolid Archiostoma besselli. The following work was initiated to
investigate the rhythmic nature of jumping behavior in the population
