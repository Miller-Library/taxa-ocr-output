Examination of tables 1, 2, and 3 and figures 3, 4 and5. reveals
the complex nature of collembolid activity in the field as a function
of time. In study period 1 (April 27-28 ) maximum activity for all
stations lower than station 16 occurs at 7:45 A.M., slightly preceeding
an 8:52 A.M. low tide. For stations15 and 16 maximum activity occurs
at the 4:20 A.M. collection soon after these stations were uncovered
by the ebbing tide. Five of the six stations sampled at 6:15 A.M. show
a decrease in activity from 5:35 A.M., thus the appearance of a bimodal
activity pattern for this particular study period. In study period 2
(May 1-2 ) a low tide occurs at 1:51 A.M. and maximum activity for
stations 11, 13, 14, and 15 occurs at the 3:40 A.M. collection, while
station 12 has maximum acivity at the onset of collecting ( 11:00 P.M.).
Station 10, though not sampled continuously throughout the night, shows
highest activity at 5:55 A.M., two hours after the other stations
sampled. This study period was unique in several respects. It followed
a week of storms, and the low tide fell up to station 16 because of the
high waves. The wave action from the storm had removed nearly one foot
of top sand from the beach, thus at station 15 there was a sudden dip
in the contour of the beach. By the time study period 3 (May 9 )
took place, the previously exposed coarse sand was again covered by fine
sand and the dip was gone. Figure 3 shows the most regular pattern
of jumping activity observed at any time, a dramatic example of the usual
pattern: all stations sampled (stations 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, and 22 )
peak suddenly at 7:30 A.M., slightly following a 7:00 A.M. low tide.
Previous to the huge 7:30 A.M. peak, stations 12, 14 and 18 have a
