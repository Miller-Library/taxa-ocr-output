independent of a simple physiological response; the collembolid clock
might be causing the increased B peak activity rather than the animals'
metab√≥lism. Further investigation is needed to explain this phenomenon,
Heckrotte's work ( 1960) with snake activity patterns suggests
an analogy that might be useful in understanding changes in peak ratios,
Heckrotte shows that a peak of activity occurs midday for low temperatures
(21.1 degrees centigrade ) and an activity peak occurs in early morning
for high temperature (35.5 degrees centigrade ), with shifting bimodal
peaks for intermediate temperatures. The conclusion he reaches is
that at each temperature activity is maximum at a time of day when
temperature would be expected to be optimum for activity. Whether or
not this sort of interpretation is applicable to collembolid activity
remains to be shown.
Another point of interest concerning the container kept in the
blue ice box deals with its teturn to very cold conditions on the third
day. The temperature in the box was maintained from 0 to 2 degrees
centigrade for approximately 22 hours, then allowed to slowly warm.
Activity peaked near 1:30 P.M. on the fourth day and did not show the
the same sort of decline that had been seen in the other containers.
This seems to suggest that the collembolid clock had been stopped by the
period of very cold temperatures and started again as the temperature
increased. There are some problems with this hypothesis in that the
container was kept in cold conditions for approximately 22 hours, yet
peak activity occurred approximately 7.5 hours later than would normally
be expected (i.e. 7.5 hours after 6:00 A.M. ). This could be explained
below a critical temperature
if the clock only terminated
in the 0 to 2 degree centigrade range. Because the cold regime fluctuated
between these temperatures, it is possible that only 7.5 hours was
