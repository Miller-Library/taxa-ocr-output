no wind, and cool air temperatures (approximately 10 degrees centigrade
throughout the night ). For the May 9 study period the most animals
were collected at station 18 at 7:30 A.M., slightly following a low tide.
This collection period was characterized by calm ocean conditions, no
wind and cool air temperatures (approximately 10 degrees centigrade
at the time of maximum activity).
Several less formal collections were also undertaken with the
following results. During a week of high winds, animals were found to
occur in negligible (less than ten collected in a two minute interval)
numbers at all times sampled during the day and night. An afternoon of
light rain at a 4:00 P.M. low tide resulted in animals being active in
numbers similar to those found in early morning periods. Collembolids
were always found in negligible numbers on warm, sunny afternoons
(10:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.).
