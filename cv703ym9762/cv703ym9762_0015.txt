spent below the critical temperature. Further work is needed to investigate
this aspect of temperature effects.
The result that different temperature regimes effect the peak ratios
suggests a hypothesis concerning the effect of temperature on the
collembolid clock. If peak B is a tidal component of a circadian clock
then it could be less obligatory and more responsive to environmental
opportunities. The following algorithm might be at work: always be
active in the early morning hours and also be active at low tide if
condtitions (temperature, humidity, et cetera) are permissible. The
observation of animals being active at a 4:00 P.M. low tide on a rainy
day is supportive of this idea. When a low tide falls at early morning
and conditions are right, one would expect the greatest activity-
there is some suggestion of this from the field data that has been
presented.
The temperature reponse curve of collembolid activity (figure 15 )
displays a maximum at cool air temperatures (14.0 degrees centigrade
in this particular experiment ). This result is in agreement with
field data.thateshows greater activity at cooler air temperatures.
No field work was done at temperatures below 10 degrees centigrade,
but it would be interesting to see how cold temperatures could reach
in the field before activity is suspended.
