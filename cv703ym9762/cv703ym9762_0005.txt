The results from three of the five study periods appear in tablesl,
2 and 3. For the other two collection periods fewer than ten collembolids
were caught in any two minute collection period. One of these study ;
periods with negligible numbers took place on a windy morning (4:00 A.M.
to 1:00 P.M. ) with a morning low tide; the other occurred on a calm
foggy day with an afternoon low tide.
For the three other collection periods jumping activity as a function
of time for two representative stations has been graphed (Figures3, 4
and 5 ). For each station at a particular time samples from A and B were
totalled, or if Al and A2 or Bl and B2 were collected, they were averaged,
then summed. A tidal cycle is superimposed on the graphs (dashed line ).
The air temperature at station O at the collection time was recorded
and appear in the tables.
Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the distribution of collembolids along the
beach at the maximum activity period for each study period. During the
five study periods, collembolids ranged from as high as station 9 to
as low as station 26, with the greatest activity generally being found
near station 19 in the middle of the tidal range. For the April 27-28
study period the largest number of specimens was collected at station
19 at 7:45 A.M. (April 28 ) slightly preceeding a low tide. The
morning hours of this collection period were characterized by calm
ocean condition, norwind and warm temperatures (approximately 16
degrees centigrade at the time of maximum activity ). For the May 1-2
study period, the largest sample was collected at station 12 at 11:00
P.M. (May 9). This study period was a night of rough ocean conditions,
