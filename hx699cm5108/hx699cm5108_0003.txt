Ca-specific channels, suggesting that Gd" mimics Ca and binds to the pore of these channels, a
mechanism that has been suggested in a number of studies (Lansman, 1990; Biagi and Enveart,
1990; Hamill and McBride, 1996). Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels were found to be
blocked by 1 uM Gd" in epithelial cells from rabbit (Vennekens, et al, 2001), and
dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca currents were blocked by 50 uM Gd" in mouse skeletal muscle
(Lansman, 1990). L-, N-, and T-type voltage-gated Ca channel currents were blocked by Gd3 in
Ã  number of studies as well, with required concentrations of Gd ranging from 200 nM to 2.5
MM (Docherty, 1988; Mlinar, and Enyeart, 1993; Biagi and Enyeart, 1990; LaCampagne, et. al.,
1994). Initial observation of the effects of Gd" on Ca current in squid GFL cells appears to
show a significant block (Gilly, unpublished observations). These blocks were sometimes
completely reversible (over a time course of minutes), reversible in a voltage-dependent manner.
or completely irreversible.
There are few studies of the effects of Gd on currents other than through Ca-specific
channels, but the few there are suggest significant effects. Ca-activated Cl-currents are blocked
by Gd, not surprisingly (Tokimasa and North, 1996), and a number of non-specific cation
currents have been shown to disappear in the presence of Gd" as well (Koh, et. al, 2001; Zhang
and Hancox, 2003; Zhang, et. al., 1998). Two studies, one in Xenopus myelinated axons and one
in cardiac muscle show that some types of K and Na currents are also blocked by Gd" (Elinder
and Arhem, 1994; Li and Baumgarten, 2001). The diversity of channels shown to be sensitive to
block by Gd" suggests that further investigation of the effects of Gd" on various ion channels.
especially Ca-specific channels, is valuable.
