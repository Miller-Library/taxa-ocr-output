Introduction
Gadolinium
The lanthanide element, gadolinium (Gd“) has been studied extensively in biological
systems in its trivalent ionic form. Gd' is in the "middle" of the lanthanides, with atomic
number 64, and an ionic radius of 0.938 A, which is very similar in size to the 0.99 A atomic
radius of Ca“ (Hamill and McBride, 1996). Gd" ions are also similar to Ca ions in their
bonding, coordination, and donor atom preference (Hamill and McBride, 1996). The first
suggestion of the biological significance of Gd" came with a study by Miller and Pickard in
1988, which showed block of thigmotropism and geotropism in plants by 10-250 uM Gd'
(Hamill and McBride, 1996). This effect was hypothesized to be due to block of Ca-permeable
mechanogated (MG) ion channels, and Gd has subsequently been shown to blocks single MG
channel currents in patch clamp studies in plants, bacteria, fungi, and animal cells (Hamill and
McBride, 1996). Gd' is often used as a diagnostic tool to determine whether MG channels are
involved in particular processes, although it does not block all MG channels, and has been found
to block other types of channels, removing its status as a specific MG channel blocker (Hamill
and McBride, 1996; Caldwell, et. al., 1998). The mechanism of block has not been established
absolutely, but Gd' is thought to be an open-channel, permeant blocker of MG channels (Hamill
and McBride, 1996). Its effects are often seen at a range of concentrations falling between 100
nM and luM, with complex, non-linear dose-response relationships in some systems (Tokimasa
and North, 1996; Hamill and McBride, 1996).
The list of non-MG channel types blocked by Gd" is growing, and includes studies
performed in a wide variety of cell types, including smooth and cardiac muscle, neurons,
endocrine and epithelial cells in myriad species. Most blocked channels, not surprisingly, are
