Abstract
The trivalent lanthanide ion gadolinium (Gd*) has been shown to block various ion
channels, particularly in mechanoreceptor systems, in which is has been used in a diagnostic
manner. Gd' has also been shown to block voltage-gated channels in a number of systems.
particularly L-, N-, and T-type Ca channels. The cells of the giant fiber lobe (GFL) of the
stellate ganglion of squid are useful in a variety of electrophysiological studies, and their currents
are well characterized, although the effects of Gd" on these currents have not been studied. We
report a lack of effect of 20 uM Gd" on K, Na, and Ca currents in these cells, either in voltage-
dependent properties or kinetics, although the Ca current (proposed to be due to a P-type Ca
channel) warrants further investigation to unequivocally identify it as a Ca current and look for
more subtle effects of Gd". This study adds to a long list of channels on which the effects of
Gd have been studied, and provides some preliminary information on the molecular structure
of the pore of P-type Ca channels, as they appear to be insensitive to Gd" block at first
approximation
