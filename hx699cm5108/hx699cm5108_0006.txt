Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Neurons from the GFL of Loligo opalescens from Monterey Bay were removed and
cultured following a previously published protocol (Gilly, et. al., 1990, see Brismar and Gilly.
1987 and Llano and Bookman, 1986), with minor changes. GFL tips were treated with 3mg/mL
non-specific protease in seawater for 1 hour. Glass coverslips (l em in diameter) were coated
with 5% concanavalin A (Con A) in distilled water, were placed in plastic culture dishes, and
allowed to dry. After approximately 90 minutes, the coverslips were washed with 2 mL distilled
water, and allowed to dry under UV light for at least one hour. After cells were plated as
previously described, they were placed in a culture medium (Leibovitz's L-15; GIBCO. Inc.)
with added 263 mM Nacl, 4.64 mM KCl, 4.25 mM CaCh, 49.54 mM MgCh, 2 mM HEPES (pH
7.8), 5 mM trehalose, 50 ug/mL penicillin G, and 0.5 mgmL streptomycin. Cells were kept in
an incubator maintained at 12-14Â°C, and medium was changed every 2 days. Recordings of K
current were made within 1-3 days of plating, and recordings of inward current were made 4-12
days after plating. Recordings were made at a maintained temperature of approximately 140C.
Solutions
Recording solutions are listed in Table 1. For experiments measuring K current, the
pipette was filled with the K+ internal solution, and the experimental bath was Na-free ASW.
For experiments measuring Na current, the pipette contained the Na- internal solution, and the
bath was ASW, with added 200 or 1000 nM TIX where noted. Gadolinium experiments were
conducted by perfusing the recording chamber with external solutions to which 20 uM GdCla
