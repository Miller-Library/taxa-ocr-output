had been added from a stock solution (ImM GdClz in distilled water). The solubility of Gd' has
been demonstrated in a variety of other studies (Caldwell, et. al., 1998).
Voltage-Clamp Recordings
Whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings were performed using standard procedures
(detailed in Gilly and Brismar, 1989, see Llano and Bookman, 1986, and Brismar and Gilly,
1987) with a maintenance temperature of 10eC. Sylgard-coated patch pipettes with resistances.
when filled, of 1-4MO were used. Cells were chosen based on the absence of axonal processes
or stumps, and recordings were deemed acceptable primarily based on a seal of at least 100 MO
Series resistance was electronically compensated (by eye). VClamp software was used for pulse
generation and data acquisition and storage. Calculations of K+ conductance were based on an
isochronal IV curve generated from the amplitudes of slow inward tail currents at a range of
voltages after a 20 ms activating pulse, as described previously (Gilly, et. al, 1990).
Conductance values were normalized to the maximum conductance values of each cell to give
relative G/V curves.
Results
Kcurrent
A large, outward current was observed in recordings with 150 mM internal K, and 10
mM external K. Based on the appearance, kinetic properties, and reversal potential (see Fig. 1).
this current was assumed to be carried predominantly by K+ ions, as previously described in
GFL preparations (Llano and Bookman, 1986). Addition of 20 uM Gd" to the external bathing
solution showed no effect on the voltage-dependence of this current (Fig. 2). In addition, the
conductance and its voltage-dependence (Fig. 3) did not change significantly with the application
