currents were measured separately as estimates of the two components. The voltage-dependence
of both currents appears to be insensitive to 20 uM Gd', as the LV curves appear almost
identical (Fig. 5). The conductance-voltage relationship also appears unaffected by 20 uM Gd
for both types of current (Fig. 6). The lack of change in the UV and G/V relationships due to
Gd, as well as visual inspection of current traces, suggests that there is no effect of Gd' on the
kinetics of either current. Further investigation of the slower inward current is necessary to
unequivocally identify it as carried by Ca, as it reversed at a potential similar to that of the TIXÂ¬
sensitive Na current, suggesting it is carried at least in part by Na. The effects of Gd' on this
slower inward current should also be further investigated, due to the conflicting nature of the
data presented here with previous observations from this laboratory (Gilly, unpublished
observations).
Discussion
The voltage-dependent ionic conductances in GFL neurons of squid are well
characterized, and thus, the results of this study can be compared to an extensive amount of
previously published data. Three main types of current were observed, and were identified as
Na, K, and Ca currents based on kinetic and pharmacological properties. The K current.
observed at day zero in all cells in recording solutions with 10 mM external and 150 mM internal
K (see Fig. 1), is a large, slowly activating, outward current, which inactivates only partially
during the length of pulses used in this experiment, and is identical to previous descriptions of K
current in GFL cells (Llano and Bookman, 1986). A molecular candidate for the channel
responsible for this current has been identified by Rosenthal and Gilly (2003) as a single type of
K channel, identical to the one found in giant axon. This K current showed no effect of 20 uM
Gd' on voltage-dependence of current or conductance (see Fig. 2 and 3), or on reversal
