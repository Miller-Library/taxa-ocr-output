of 20 uM Gdâ€œ. Based on the lack of significant effects of Gd' on UV and G/V relationships as
well as visual inspection of current traces, it is also assumed that Gdt has no effect on the
kinetic properties of K channels.
Inward Current
As detailed in previous investigations (Brismar and Gilly, 1987, Gilly and Brismar, 1989
Gilly, et. al, 1990), the cell bodies of GFL neurons do not show significant inward current in
vivo. However, after 4-6 days in culture, an inward current develops in these cells that is smaller
than those found in giant axon, but is identical in its properties (Gilly and Brismar, 1989. Fig. 4)
This current has two components, the first, identified as Na current by its reversal potential and
1IX-sensitivity, is hypothesized to arise from the inappropriate distribution of Na channels to
cell bodies rather than axons (Gilly, et. al., 1990). Due to the presence of Na inside (220 mM) as
well as outside (480 mM) the cell, the current observed is both inward at voltages more negative
than the reversal potential, and outward at voltages more positive than the reversal potential.
The characteristic fast kinetics of activation and inactivation are present. The majority of this
current inactivates, although there is some non-inactivating current present, as seen by Gilly and
Brismar (1989)
A slower, non-inactivating component, can also be distinguished by its insensitivity to
TIX (Fig. 4). This TIX-insensitive current is most likely carried by Ca through Ca channels
based on standard criteria: insensitivity to TIX, slower kinetics (time constant of activation on
the order of 5 ms, at first approximation, which is much slower than typical Na current), lack of
inactivation, and comparison to currents observed in GFL cell bodies by Llano and Bookman
(1986) and others (Gilly and Brismar, 1989; Brismar and Gilly, 1987). For purposes of
experimental design, TTX was not applied in all cases, but instead, the peak and steady-state
