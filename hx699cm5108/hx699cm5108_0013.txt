LaCampagne, 1994). Although most blocking effects of Gd' are seen at doses lower than 20
HM Gd", it is possible that these currents would be blocked by higher concentrations, another
avenue of further investigation.
If it is true that the Ca current found in GFL neuron cell bodies is carried through a P¬
type channel, this study may provide insight into the structure of such channels as compared to
L-, N-, and T-type channels. The mechanism of Gd" block of such channels has been proposed
to be open-channel block by Gd" binding to a site inside the channel (Lansman, 1990: Biagi and
Enyeart, 1990; Hamill and McBride, 1996). Therefore, the lack of a blocking effect seen in P-
type channels would suggest a significant difference in the structure of the pore of these channels
as compared to L, N-, and T-type channels, whereas effective block would suggest a similarity
in structures amongst the Ca channel subtypes. Further study is necessary to unequivocally
describe the mechanism of action of Gd", however, before such structural inferences will be
reliable.
Conclusions
The effects of Gd" ions on the currents in squid GFL neuron cell bodies were examined.
The currents, identified as K, Na, and (most likely) P-type Ca currents, were unaffected by 20
AM Gd" in their voltage-dependent properties, reversal potentials, and kinetics. This study adds
to à growing literature on the effects of Gd' on diverse channel types, and provides an avenue of
further investigation of the effects of Gd" on P-type Ca channels.
