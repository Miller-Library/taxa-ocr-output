inappropriate trafficking of Na channels normally sent to axons, but now expressed in somatic
membranes, and a number of studies have attempted to elucidate the processes necessary for this
trafficking (Gilly and Brismar, 1989; Brismar and Gilly, 1987; Gilly, et. al., 1990). The
properties of the somatic Na current are almost identical to those of axonic Na current (with only
very few subtle kinetic differences, probably due to post-translational modifications)—it is fast-
activating and deactivating, TTX- and STX-sensitive (at 50-200 nM concentrations), has
characteristic voltage-dependence, threshold (-40 mV), reversal potential (which demonstrates
high Na selectivity), and is partially blocked by elevated levels of external Ca (50 mM) (Gilly
and Brismar, 1989; Brismar and Gilly, 1987; Gilly, et. al., 1990; Llano and Bookman, 1986).
The majority of this current inactivates fairly quickly, although a small (and variable) non-
inactivating component has been identified that is otherwise identical (Gilly and Brismar, 1989).
Two molecular clone candidates have been isolated for this Na channel (Rosenthal and Gilly.
2003).
The present study examines the effects of 20 uM Gd' on the currents of squid GFL cell
bodies. The previously described Na, K, and Ca currents were present, with no observed
deviation from published descriptions. No effects of 20 uM Gd" were seen on any of the three
current types, either on voltage-dependent properties or kinetics. Further study of the Ca current
is necessary to firmly establish its Gd' insensitivity, and identify it as a P-type voltage¬
dependent Ca channel. This result would contribute to the discrimination of various Ca channel
types, as L, N, and T-type Ca channels have all shown sensitivity to Gd' in other studies
(including preliminary studies of squid GFL Ca current conducted in this laboratory), and
inferences about the structures of the pores of these channels could be made based on their low
affinity for Gd' ions.
