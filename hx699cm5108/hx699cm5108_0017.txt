Fig. 1. Inset: pulse pattern used to generate current families shown in a) and b). a) Current
family generated by a series of positive voltage steps from a holding potential of -80 mV. The
cell contained 150 mM K internal and 10 mM K external. b) Current family generated as in a)
with the addition of 20 uM Gd to the external solution.
Fig. 2. Voltage-dependence of currents in cells containing 150 mM internal and 10 mM external
K, with and without the addition of 20 uM Gd to the external solution. There is no significant
difference amongst the conditions.
Fig. 3. Voltage-dependence of conductance in cells containing 150 mM internal and 10 mM
external K, with and without the addition of 20 uM Gd' to the external solution. Curves were
normalized by dividing all values by the maximum conductance of each cell. There is no
significant difference amongst the conditions.
Fig. 4. Inset: pulse pattern used to generate current families shown in a) and b). a) Current
family generated by a series of positive voltage steps from a holding potential of -80 mV. The
cell contained 220 mM Na and O Ca internal and 480 mM Na and 10 mM Ca external, b)
Current family generated as in a) with the addition of 20 uM Gd to the external solution.
Fig. 5. Voltage-dependence of currents in cells containing 220 mM Na and 0 Ca internal and
480 mM Na and 10 mM Ca external, with and without the addition of 20 uM Gd to the external
solution. There is no significant difference amongst the conditions.
Fig. 6. Voltage-dependence of conductance in cells containing 220 mM Na and 0 Ca internal
and 480 mM Na and 10 mM Ca external, with and without the addition of 20 uM Gd to the
external solution. Curves were normalized by dividing all values by the maximum conductance
of each cell. There is no significant difference amongst the conditions.
