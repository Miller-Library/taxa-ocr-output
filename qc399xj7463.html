Abstract
Mussels of the species, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>Mytilus californianus,</span> are know to have a
multidrug-resistance transport protein (p-glycoprotein, MDR) analogous
to the multidrug resistance protein found in many human tumor cell
lines, which protectively transports a wide range of moderately
hydrophobic and potentially toxic compounds out of cells. Previous
studies have suggested the transporter may be inducible by exposure
to environmental toxins. The present study examined whether
exposure to toxic compounds would induce mussels to increase
synthesis or activity of p-glycoprotein. After exposing animals for 1-3
weeks to two model genotoxic compounds, 2-Acetylaminofluorene and
3-Methylcholanthrene, gill tissues were analyzed by Western Blot to
quantify protein levels. In addition, two assays analyzing the efflux
rates of a fluorescent p-glycoprotein substrate were employed in order
to study the kinetics of the transporter's activity. Results of the
kinetics assays showed no significant difference between control
organisms and exposed organisms in rates of efflux of the fluorescent
substrate (ANCÖVA: p=0.924, p=0.357). Western analyses to date have
been inconclusive. Thus, this study does not show significant
inductive effects of exposures to non-lethal levels of genotoxin.
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Introduction
P-glycoprotein, also known as MDR, is a ubiquitous 170 kDa
membrane transport protein which was first discovered in human
tumor cell lines, where it renders cells resistant to many forms of
chemotherapy (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993). Since its discovery in
tumor cells, analogous MDR proteins have been found in a number of
other vertebrate tissues and in the tissues of some marine
invertebrates (Kurelec, 1992). Its role in marine invertebrates is
thought to be as a protective mechanism against environmental toxins.
MDR is unique among protective mechanisms in that it resides in
the cell membrane. Whereas other protective mechanisms — such as
the cytochrome p450 system - work intracellularly to detoxify
compounds, MDR acts at the surface of the cell, presumably removing
substances before they can exhibit their toxic effect.
MDR substrates comprise a wide variety of compounds. Cornwall et
al. (1995) have identified a number of these compounds in the mussel
Mytilus californianus. They include various xenobiotics and rhodamine,
a fluorescent dye (Cornwall et al., 1995). While most transport proteins
are very specific in the types of compounds they carry, the MDR protein
is unique in its ability to transport a wide variety of unrelated
compounds. Most MDR substrates appear to have a single
characteristic common - that they are moderately hydrophobic. This
might contribute to their transport by allowing them to associate both
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
with the membrane (where the p-glycoprotein is located) and with the
either an intracellular or extracellular aqueous environment
(Gottesman and Pastan, 1993).
Several researchers have suggested that MDR might be inducible
upon contact with its substrates. Schrenk et al. (1994) found that in
rat hepatocytes, exposure to 10 uM concentrations of the genotoxin 2-
acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) caused induction of the protein (Schrenk et
al., 1994). Similar induction results have been found in human tumor
cell lines upon exposure to 2AAF, as well as another genotoxin 3-
methylcholanthrene (3MC), and various chemotherapeutic drugs
(Thorgeirsson et al., 1991). Furthermore, Kurelec suggested that 3 days
exposure to used diesel oil was sufficient to cause induction in the
mussel, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus galloprovincialis : Exact'>Mytilus galloprovincialis</span> (Kurelec, 1995). This study attempted
to further analyze the inducibility of the MDR protein in the marine
mussel, Mytilus californianus.
Whether MDR, like other protective mechanisms, is inducible
remains a much debated topic which is of interest for a number of
reasons. First, general characterization of this protein is desirable,
particularly since it is highly ubiquitous. Second, although it is
presumed to serve a protective role, no research has been able to
definitively characterize this as the protein’s major function in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus : Exact'>Mytilus.</span>
Establishing similarities between MDR and other defense mechanisms
would lend credence to this theory. Third, and most relevant to this
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
model system, if MDR is inducible and is found to be present in
proportion to the amount of substrate in an organism’s environment, it
could presumably be used as a measure of the amount of toxic
pollution in a given marine environment.
Based upon work by other researchers, this study attempted to
induce MDR in the mussel, Mytilus californianus, by exposing organisms
to two presumably potent inducers of the system, 2AAF and 3MC.
Induction was studied using two techniques. (1) In order to quantify
the amount of MDR protein in animals exposed to toxin versus
unexposed animals, Western Blot analysis was performed on isolated
gill tissues from experimental organisms. (2) Comparisons of the
activity of MDR between exposed and unexposed animals was made
using the fluorescent substrate rhodamine. Changes in tissue
fluorescence were used as a measure of p170 function; the rate of
enzyme activity was compared between gill tissues of mussels exposed
to different compounds as a means of comparing MDR levels between
organisms.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
The test chemicals, DMSO, 2AAF, and 3MC, were obtained from Sigma
Corp. The C219 monoclonal 1° antibody was obtained from Signet.
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 2° antibody was
obtained from Pierce.
Animals
Adult mussels of the species Mytilus californianus were collected from
the wave-exposed intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove, California. Mussels were stored for one day in circulating sea
water before incubation in any of the test inducing agents. Specimens
ranged in size from approximately 4 cm to 7 cm.
Experimental Incubation
Animals were incubated at 12-14°C in 350 mls of filtered sea water
(FSW), supplemented with (1) nothing, (2) O.1% DMSO, (3) 10 uM 2AAF
in O.1% DMSO, or (4) 5 uM 3MC in 0.1% DMSO, for 1 to 3 weeks. Air
stones provided the animals with a continuous flow of air. The water
was changed every third day to provide nutrients to the filter-feeding
animals.
Westem Blot Analysis
In order to confirm the presence of the MDR protein and to compare
levels of protein between animals in different experimental treatments,
gill tissue samples were prepared as previously described by Cornwall
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
et al. (1995). Additionally, membrane vesicles were prepared from gill
tissues by the procedure described by Cornwell et al. (1986). Protein
concentration of both tissue homogenates and vesicle samples were
determined by the BCA protein assay (Smith et al., 1985). 40ug of each
sample was loaded onto and separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel
(BioRad Mini-Protean II) by the procedure of Laemlli et al. (1973)
transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry transfer, and incubated with
the C219 monoclonal antibody followed by goat anti-mouse HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed by
chemiluminesence (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England). The
DX5 tumor cell line, which overexpresses the MDR phenotype, was
used as a positive control for p-glycoprotein. The MES-SA (MES) was a
negative control, which lacks MDR.
Assays for MDR Activity using Rhodamine Efflux Rates
Part A: Fluorometry Assay
Sections of gill tissue were prepared on ice by punching circular disks
of tissue from excised mussel gills with the end of a yellow pipeteman
tip. Eight such disks were then placed in a sack made of 300 u Nitex
mesh and incubated at 12°C in a 50 ml capacity beaker with 30 mls of 5
UM fluorescent rhodamine for 1 hour. The sack of tissues was then
removed from the dye, swirled for 10 seconds in FSW to remove
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
extracellular rhodamine, and then placed in a second 50 ml capacity
beaker with 30 mls FSW. A stir bar was added to ensure even mixing of
effluxed dye with medium. 200ul aliquots of the medium were removed
at 30 second intervals. The aliquots were analyzed on a fluorometer at
an excitation wavelength of 555 nm for emission intensity at 579 nm.
Part B: Tissue Imaging Assay
Small sections of tissue were cut with scissors from the dorsal end of
the ascending arms of a single lamella of the mussel gill (Cornwall et
al., 1995). Tissue sections were incubated at 12°C in 5 mls of luM
rhodamine for 45 minutes. A single piece of tissue was then rinsed for
15 seconds in FSW to remove extracellular dye, and then viewed under
a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter.
A single section of the tissue was visualized using a digital image
processor. Images were captured at 30 second intervals. Individual
filaments were analyzed for their fluorescence intensity using the
Image-1 (Universal Imaging Systems) computer analysis program.
Statistics
Linear regressions of the graphs of Fluorescence vs. Time were
performed for data from both activity assays. The slopes of these lines
were taken to be proportional to the rate of efflux over time. Slopes
from the different treatments were tested for equality by Analysis of
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Covariance (ANCÖVA) using the SyStat statistical analysis package. A
p value § 0.05 was taken to be significant.
Results
Westem Blot Analyses: Confirming the presence of MDR
Analysis by Western Blot confirmed the presence of MDR in M.
californianus. The MDR was present in visibly higher concentrations in
the mussel tissue than in the positive control, DX5 (a tumor cell line
which overexpresses the MDR phenotype), when 40 ug of total protein
was analyzed. Moreover, MDR was highly enriched in a sample of
membrane vesicles isolated from Mytilus tissue with respect to whole
tissue homogenates. High concentrations of MDR were found in all
tissue samples after one week exposure to toxins. However, no
significant difference was seen between these samples and control
samples taken from animals exposed to FSW for the same amount of
time.
Figure 1 shows the results of initial studies of tissue samples by
Western Blot. Lane 4 (left-to-right) shows the MDR protein (170 kDa
band) highly enriched in the membrane vesicles preparation compared
to the DX5 cell line in lane 3, as well as the tissue homogenates
(lanes 6 & 7).
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Figure 2 compares MDR levels in animals following 1 week of
exposure to test chemicals. Each sample was from a pooled
homogenate of combined gill tissue from three animals. Since all 170
kDa bands appear very intense, comparisons between treatment groups
are difficult to make, and results from this assay are inconclusive.
Assays for MDR Activity using Rhodamine Efflux Rates
Summary of Findings
As a means of comparing MDR activity, comparisons were made
between the efflux rates of rhodamine dye, a fluorescent substrate of
the MDR protein. The P-glycoprotein has been shown by other
researchers (Schrenk et al. 1994) to follow first order kinetics in its
substrate efflux; hence the efflux rate is independent of substrate
concentration. Therefore, comparisons of the efflux rates can be used
to compare the amount of total protein function in the tissues of
various treatment types.
This study confirmed the first-order kinetics results. Log
transforms of a graph of the fluorescence vs. time approximated a
linear curve in both assays performed (fluorometry assay R2= 0.917;
microscopy assay R2= 0.956) (see figures 4 & 7). No difference was
found in the efflux rates from tissues exposed to one week of toxin
with respect to controls, as measured by the fluorometry assay,
Similarly, no difference was seen in rate following a three week
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
exposure to 2AAF or 3MC relative to FSW controls by fluorescence
microscopy. A significant difference was seen in the rate following 3
weeks exposure to the carrier, DMSO, relative to the FSW control by
fluorescence microscopy.
Part A: Comparing MDR Activity, Measuring Dye Efflux by Fluorometry
An assay of efflux rate was performed after a 1 week to the various
treatments. Figure 3 shows the relative increases in the fluorescence
of the medium following tissue loading for 1 hour with 5uM rhodamine.
The fluorescence increase in the media is assumed to be a result of
rhodamine efflux by MDR. Data points represent the mean emission
intensity for two samples of tissue from each treatment type.
Emission intensities were similar in all cases.
The data has been fit to log-transformed linear regression, R2-
0.917. The slope of the lines is proportional to the rate of efflux.
Previous studies have shown that the MDR enzyme follows first order
kinetics, thus relative rates of efflux reflect relative protein
concentrations (Schrenk et al., 1994). A comparison of the slopes by
ANCOVA shows no significant difference between any of the treatment
groups, P= 0.924 (Figure 4).
Figure 4 displays the ratio of the experimental groups’ efflux rates
to the control efflux rates. The slopes of each of the lines from Figure
3 has been divided by the slope of the FSW line to give a ratio of efflux
10
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
rate relative to control (Figure 5). The ratios are virtually 1 in all cases.
No statistically significant difference exists.
Part B: Comparing MDR Efflux Activity Using Fluorescence Microscopy
Following three weeks of exposure to potential inducers, a section
of mussel gill from each of the experimental treatments was incubated
for 45 minutes in luM rhodamine. Following incubation, a single
tissue segment was observed under fluorescence microscopy. At 30
second time points, images were captured and individual filament
fluorescence was determined. Figure 6 are fluorescence micrographs
showing gill tissue fluorescence in mussels exposed for three weeks to
FSW (A,B), DMSO (C,D) , 2-AAF (E,F), and 3MC (G,H) at 1.5 minutes
and at 15 minutes (3MC is at 1min 30 sec, 14 min 30 sec). Figure 7
shows a graph of the decrease in tissue fluorescence over time for each
of the treatment groups. Data points represent mean fluorescence per
pixel averaged over the area of a single gill filament per image.
The data has been fit to a log-transformed linear regression (See
Figure 8); R2= 0.956. The slope of line is proportional to the efflux rate,
and is representative of MDR activity. Comparison by ANCOVA of
efflux rates between the control, 2-AAF, and 3-MC treatments showed
no significant difference, P=0.351. Treatment with the DMSO carrier
control alone did show a statistically significant difference in efflux
rate from the other 3 samples, P=0.000.
11
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Again, the slope of the log-transformed linear regression from figure
8 for each treatment type was divided by the slope of the line for the
FSW control (Figure 8) to give a ratio of efflux rate relative to standard.
The ratios are approximately 1 for 2AAF and 3MC each relative to
control; no significant difference is seen (Figure 9). DMSO treatment
(carrier control) resulted in an efflux rate 1.33 times as fast as the
FSW control (Figure 9). This difference was statistically significant,
p-0.000.
Discussion
Whether the MDR system can be induced by exposure to toxins /
substrates is a much debated issue. Previous reports by a number of
researchers have suggested inducibility in a variety of cell types and
with a variety of substances, the most potent of which include 2AAF
and 3MC (Thorgeirsson et al., 1991; Gant et al., 1991; Schrenk et al.,
1994; Gant et al., 1995). Kurelec observed induction with diesel oil in
the mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, after 3 days of exposure (Kurelec,
1995). However, the present work suggests that 1 to 3 week exposures
of mussels of the related species, M. californianus, to 5 uM 3MC or 10
UM 2AAF are insufficient to cause induction of the MDR protein.
Analysis by Western Blot using the C219 mammalian monoclonal
antibody confirmed the presence of MDR in the mussel, Mytilus
californianus. This is consistent with previous studies in this species
﻿12
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
(Cornwall et al., 1995). The relative abundance of MDR can be seen by
comparing the 170 kDa bands on a Western Blot to both the DX5
positive control cell line, a tumor cell line which overexpresses the
MDR phenotype, and eggs of the echiuran worm, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Urechis caupo : Exact'>Urechis caupo,</span> also
know to contain MDR protein (Toomey and Epel, 1993).
Comparisons of the samples across treatment lines in this study is
inconclusive in the Western Blot. The blot in Figure 2 cannot really be
interpreted to say whether or not there has been induction because
the bands from all samples are so intense. Since M. califomnianus has
such a high concentration of MDR, Western Blotting may not be
sensitive enough to detect small differences in the amount of this
protein. An alternative immunochemical technique which may be a
more sensitive means to asses protein content is dot blotting, in which
varying concentrations of proteins can be used, (See Galgani et al.,
1995).
Analysis of data from two MDR activity assays suggests that no
induction resulted from exposure to 2AAF or 3MC under the present
experimental conditions. Previous work has shown that MDR follows
first-order kinetics in its efflux rate, at least during the early stages of
efflux. Thus the rate is an inherent characteristic of the protein and
does not depend on the concentration of the substrate (Schrenk et al.
1994; Bornmann & Roepe, 1994).
13
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Given that rhodamine is a substrate of the MDR, assaying the
medium for increased rhodamine fluorescence over time analyzes
MDR's efflux rate. Using a competitive inhibitor of MDR, verapamil
other studies (Cornwall et al, 1995) have shown that rhodamine is an
MDR substrate in <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Mytilus : PartialExact'>Mytilus gill,</span> since addition of verapamil to gill tissue
slows the rate at which rhodamine is effluxed from the tissues.
Hence, rhodamine transport is used here to quantify transporter
function.
Rhodamine transport was analyzed using fluorometry. The medium
into which rhodamine-loaded tissues effluxed the dye was sampled for
its fluorescence over time. The slope of the resulting log-transformed
line was taken to represent the rate, and efflux rates were compared
between mussel gill tissues from the different treatment groups.
Statistical analyses by ANCOVA of the first-order efflux rates
treatment groups following one-week exposures showed no differences.
Given that no inhibitor was used in this assay, one could question
whether the rhodamine efflux observed might not actually be a result
of diffusion rather than MDR transport. However, the data still
suggest that there has been no induction for two reasons. First of all,
as other researchers have shown, large changes in substrate
concentrations such as those observed, are unlikely to be due to the
slow process of diffusion alone (Bornmann and Roepe, 1994). Yet, it
would be good to explore this possibility further. Roepe conducted
﻿14
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
studies in two tumor cell lines with fluorescent coumarin-conjugated
vinblastine to show that efflux of this substrate was almost entirely
due to the action of the MDR protein, rather than to passive diffusion
(Roepe, 1992). Studies using fluorescent rhodamine in mussels would
be useful in order to discover the proportions of efflux rate due to MDR
versus passive diffusion.
Secondly, since rhodamine is a known substrate of MDR, if there
had been induction, a higher efflux rate would be observed in induced
animals compared to those seen in seawater controls. Even if the
controls were showing only the effects of diffusion, induced animals
would be displaying the combinatory effects of increased MDR
expression and baseline diffusion; thus the rate would be increased.
Still, future studies with media fluorescence as a measure of MDR
activity should be conducted in order to address this issue of diffusion
versus efflux.
Further efflux data using a fluorescence microscope confirmed the
above result that no induction occurred as a result of exposure to 3MC
or 2AAF. Tissues exposed to the two genotoxins for three weeks were
viewed under a fluorescence microscope after 45 minutes incubation in
rhodamine dye. The decrease in tissue fluorescence over time
reflected the rate of MDR function, since MDR transports rhodamine
out of the gill tissues. Statistical analysis showed no difference in
efflux rate for the exposed tissues with respect to control tissues.
15
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
The information from this study brings into question other research
that suggests induction of p-glycoprotein by 2AAF and 3MC. However,
previous studies have primarily used human tumor cell lines or rat
hepatocytes in order to study induction (Gant et al., 1995; Schrenk et al,
1994). The levels of toxin employed here were selected based upon
what others have used, but they are somewhat arbitrary concentrations
for use in the context of mussels. Suggested further research would
be to analyze the mussel gill tissues in a bioaccumulation assay to
determine how much of the toxins are in fact reaching the gill tissues.
This would allow one to determine if 2AAF and 3MC are, in fact,
inducers of the p-glycoprotein, or if they were simply not present in a
high enough concentration in order to have an effect.
While these two chemicals, 2AAF and 3MC, did not appear to cause
induction of MDR, one assay did suggest that DMSO may have had an
inducing effect after three weeks of exposure (figures 8&9). This issue
warrants further study, particularly since only one of two MDR activity
assays gave this result.
DMSO was initially used as a carrier control because it was used
to dissolve the genotoxins. The data to date regarding DMSO as an
inducer are controversial. While DMSO has been shown not to be a
substrate of the p-glycoprotein (Dorr and Liddil, 1991), one study using
human tumor cells did suggest that DMSO does induce MDR (Mickely
et al., 1989). In general, inducible protective mechanisms are induced
﻿16
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
by the specific substrates of the system. For example, the cytochrome
p450 system is induced upon exposure to its specific substrates
(Thorgeirrson et al., 1991). However, given the ubiquitous nature of p-
glycoprotein, it may be possible that an inducer need not be a
substrate of the system. For example, Chaudhary and Roninson found
that exposure of human tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs which
were not substrates of the MDR system caused induction (Chaudhary
& Roninson, 1993). Öther studies suggest that MDR induction may be
part of a more general stress-response mechanism. Chin et al. (1990)
found increased MDR expression in two human renal carcinoma lines
in response to injections of heat-shock proteins. This result has not
been confirmed. Thus it remains to be seen what mediates MDR
expression and induction - whether it is mediated by a general
intracellular shock-response system, by contact with cellular toxins, by
contact with it substrates, or by some combination of the above.
Future Directions
MDR induction is an active area of research which has the potential
for practical ecological applications. For example, if MDR is induced
upon contact with environmental substrates, its concentration in an
organism may be correlated with the amount of toxin the animal has
encountered. In this way, MDR levels in organisms of a species such
as M. californianus from different locations might be used as a measure
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
of relative environmental pollution levels. MDR concentrations might
be used to assay the effects of acute environmental changes such as
those resulting from a toxic spill or similar catastrophes. Furthermore,
changes in MDR levels over time might be used as a measure of
chronic changes in pollution levels at a given site.
Hence, much more research should be done to study the induction
properties of MDR. This study suggests a number of directions for
future research. First of all, current techniques of analyzing MDR
function should be further explored. Using rhodamine, the issue of
how much of tissue fluorescence change is due to efflux versus passive
diffusion must be elucidated.
Secondly, more work should be done to characterize the effects of
different compounds and different concentrations of those compounds
on MDR expression. For example, a possible experiment would be to
repeat the exposures in this study with a number of different
concentrations of potential inducers, and follow with bioaccumulation
assays to discern precisely how much toxin is actually reaching the
tissues. Multiple-concentrations of the same compound could be
analyzed for their effects, to see if there exists a threshold of toxin
above which the MDR system is induced.
Thirdly, more sensitive methods of quantifying proteins could be
used in order to detect small differences in amount of MDR protein
between organisms from different experimental treatments or
18
Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
ecological environments. For example, dot blots or radioactive
substrate binding studies might provide more specific information
about protein content in specific tissues. This would allow for more
accurate comparisons of MDR levels between organisms.
Given the potential for important ecological applications of MDR
induction, more research should be done in this arena. Preliminary
results with the species Mytilus californianus presented here give an
indication of future areas for fruitful research to elucidate the
mechanism of MDR induction in the tissues of marine mussels.
