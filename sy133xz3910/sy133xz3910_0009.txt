Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
exposed conditions (Petersen and Johansen, 1973).
Similar chemical analysis for lactate or succinate in
body fluid of exposed Nuttallina and Tonicella would
help to confirm the presence or absence of oxygen debt.
This evidence suggests an internal regulatory
control rather than a structural alteration through
which Nuttallina has adapted to exposure. Newell (1970)
has reviewed in detail the recognized physiological responses
of intertidal animals to a decreased availability of
oxygen. Possible mechanisms of avoiding oxygen debt
include: 1) excretion of anaerobic products 2) maintenance
of stores of oxygen within respiratory pigments in the
body 3) reduction of activity and general body metabolism
during restrictive periods. The latter possibility is
supported by observations that Nuttallina becomes
extremely sluggish and remains sessile when emersed.
Similar behavior was noted in Cryptochiton stelleri
(Petersen and Johansen, 1973).
Finally, the possibility must be considered that
measurements in the laboratory may not accurately
reflect behavior during exposure in the field. Animals
were always maintained on flat glass surfaces during
manometric and observational studies of responses to
emersion. However, field studies show Nuttallina
to be found wedged in cracks or depressions in the
