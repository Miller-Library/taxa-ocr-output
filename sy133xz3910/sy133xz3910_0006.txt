Respiration of Nuttallina and Tonicella
sea water was replaced to its original level in the
vessels and post-exposure respiration followed for 4-9
hours.
Each run consisted of a maximum of 3 Nuttallina
and 3 Tonicella. Final data were compiled from 10 of
each species, 7 of which were followed through re¬
submersion. Additionally, several of each species were
run as controls which were handled exactly as were the
experimental animals, but were maintained submerged
throughout the experimental period. Data were
expressed as oxygen consumption in ul 0/g wet weight/hr
for each of the three experimental phases, and as
ratios of aerial rate/ submerged rate and resubmerged
rate/ submerged rate for each individual.
Results
Both Nuttallina and Tonicella displayed remarkedly
constant oxygen consumption rates during the primary
submerged and aerial phases of the experiment, possibly
reflecting the standardization of activity imposed by
the restraining chambers. A greater variation of rate
with time was observed during the resubmersion period.
Table 1 summarizes the average primary submerged
rate, aerial/submerged rate ratios, and resubmerged/sub¬
merged rate ratios for experimental and control animals
