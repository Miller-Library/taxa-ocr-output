Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
FIGURE EXPLANATIONS
Fig. 1
Top: Schematic cross-sections of Tonicella
and Nuttallina showing ctenidia in the pallial groove.
Center: Ctenidia lateral views. Bottom: Typical
cross-sections of the ctenidia.
Fig. 2
a. Schematic cross-section of Nuttallina
with girdle partially raised on the left side and
totally raised on the right.
b. Schematic cross-section of Nuttallina with girdle
in the clamped-down position. Note ctenidia pressed
against the foot.
Fig. 3
The "restraining chamber" in which animals
were maintained during experimentation. Actual size;
1.5 cm diameter X 3 cm length.
Fiq. 4
Mean relative respiratory rates of 10
Nuttallina and 10 Tonicella during successive periods
of submersion, exposure, and 7 animals of each species
after resubmersion. Lines through bars indicate standard
deviation.

in the corner of an aquarium. Note the raised girdle, the
exposed gills, and the large water-holding capacity of the
pallial groove.
