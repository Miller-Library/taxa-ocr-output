Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
substratum, with the girdle molded to the contour of
the local environment. A similar preference was
noted in the laboratory, where Nuttallina grouped
into corners of aquaria rather than remaining on flat
surfaces. This preferential "wedging" is possibly
an adaptive response which allows for a raised girdle
and maximum gill exposure while simultaneously
protecting the gills and maintaining a large water
reservoir in the pallial groove during aerial exposure
(fig. 5). In this manner, the collapse of the ctenidia
would be avoided and efficiency of respiration maximized
in the emersed state.
SUMMARY
The respiratory anatomy and function of inter-
tidal Nuttallina californica and subtidal Tonicella
lineata were compared in an attempt to elucidate
adaptations of the former to frequent aerial exposure.
Ctenidial structure was found to be very similar, with-
out additional self-support in Nuttailina. Most
significant is the thicker more actively flexible
girdle in Nuttallina which permits control of gill
exposure and possibly maintains a reservoir of water
beneath the gills in the naturally exposed state.
