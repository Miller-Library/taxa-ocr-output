Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella page 2
INTRODUCTION
Marine molluscs which occupy middle and upper
intertidal regions must be adapted to periodic exposure
to air. Whileadptations toward avoiding desiccation are
usually apparent, the means by which these animals cope
with respiratory problems during periods of emersion is
not so immediately evident. Studies of intertidal
molluscs have demonstrated an ability to breathe air
in several species, and some investigations (Sandison,
1966; Micallef and Bannister, 1967) have revealed
capacities for aerial respiration even greater than
those possible in the submerged state. Adaptations
to air breathing typically involve 1) increased
rigidity of the ctenidial lamellae (Steen, 1971) and
2) increased vascularization of the mantle skirt (Newell,
1970).
Several species of Polyplacophora occur in the
upper intertidal region and face the problems of exposure.
However, the only study known to me on aerial respiration
in chitons concerned the low intertidal species
Cryptochiton stelleri (Middendorff, 1846) (Petersen and
Johansen, 1973). The work described here involved
Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847), which is found at
+3 to +5 foot tidal levels and is frequently exposed to
