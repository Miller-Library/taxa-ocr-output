Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
Manometric studies have shown aerial respiration rates
to be equally depressed to 73% of the submerged rate
in both species. Though Nuttallina has not apparently
adapted for increased efficiency of air breathing,
studies of recovery from extended periods of exposure
have indicated a probable oxygen debt present in
Tonicella and absent in Nuttallina. Field and lab-
oratory observations suggest that Nuttallina decreases
its metabolic activity when uncovered. However, further
work is necessary to confirm these conclusions and to
elucidate the physiological basis of Nuttallina's
resistance to oxygen debt during periods of exposure.
