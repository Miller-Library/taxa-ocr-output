chambers, where they remained throughout the experiment.
Chambers were placed in an aquarium supplied with circulating.

allowed to equilibrate in a horizontal position under

Oxygen consumption was measured on individual

exposure to humid air, and secondary submersion.
Respiration rates were determined by the direct method
of Warburg using standard manometric technique as
described by Umbreit et al. (1972). Restraining chambers
were adapted to fit available Warburg vessels so as to
maintain animals in the submerged condition and horizontal
position. All phases of the experiment were conducted
at 13.5°C with vessels agitated to maximize diffusion
of oxygen.
Submerged rates of oygen consumption were first
determined with chambers immersed in glass fiber-filtered
sea water, and readings taken half-hourly for a period
of 4-6 hours. Chambers were then removed, drained for
I minute on paper towels, and returned to vessels
containing 0.3 ml sea water to maintain humidity.
Aerial respiration rates were then recorded under these
conditions for the next 12 hours. Finally, filtered
