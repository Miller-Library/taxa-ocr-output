Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
Robbins
in the pallial groove for several hours with its girdle
down, but in its normally raised position the gills were
freely exposed to air. Tonicella usually developed
air pockets in its pallial groove, though it too could
hold water beneath the gills under moist conditions.
In both animals, when the gills were exposed to air
they collapsed against the foot or the back of the pallial
groove. In this state they were kept moist with a mucusÂ¬
like secretion.
RESPIRATION STUDIES
Materials and Methods
Chitons were collected weekly from the Mussel Point
area surrounding Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
Calif. Nuttallina were obtained intertidally at the 13
to 15 foot tidal level on exposed rock faces, while
Tonicella were found subtidally in rocky areas at -15
to -25 feet. Animals were scrubbed to remove any
commensal algae, and a standard "wet weight" determined
after blotting for 30 seconds on a paper towel. Chitons
were then placed in "restraining chambers" (fig. 3)
designed to minimize activity and facilitate future
manipulation. Restraining chambers were constructed of
1.5 X 3 cm glass plates enclosed in perforated plastic
