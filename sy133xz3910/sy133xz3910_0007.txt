Respiration of Nuttallina and Tonicella
of each species. Results for experimental animals are
depicted in fig. 4. Individuals of both species exhibited
aerial respiration at a level significantly (p£.001:
paired points t-test) below that of the initial submerged
rate, while controls showed a slight elevation of rate
during this period. Furthermore, the average fractional
decrease in rate upon exposure was very similar («.73)
for both Nuttallina and Tonicella. The pattern of
post-exposure respiration, however, differed significantly
(pX.025; Student's t-test) between the two. While
Nuttallina's resubmerged rate returned to 94.5% of its
initial submerged rate and was depressed below.the
associated control, that of Tonicella rose 22% above
its original wef rate and was elevated above its control,
DISCUSSION
Anatomical studies present little evidence for any
adaptation to aerial respiration in Nuttallina. Excepting
the observed differences in numbers of ctenidia and
filaments, the basic orientation and structure of the
gills in Nuttallina and Tonicella appears very similar.
The expected adaptation towards increased rigidity is
apparently absent in the ctenidia of Nuttallina; the gills
collapse upon exposure as do those of Tonicella
