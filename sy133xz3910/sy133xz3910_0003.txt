Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
closer examination reveals that Nuttallina ctenidia are
somewhat stouter and contain 250% more lamellae. These
filaments do not appear to possess greater self-support
than do those of Tonicella.
Major differences between the two respiratory
systems include the shape of the pallial cavity and the
involvement of the girdle in its regulation. As seen in
fig. 1, Nuttallina has a relatively deep pallial groove
bounded by a highly thickened and bristly girdle. The
orientation of the girdle is variable and under voluntary
control; it may be partially or totally raised, promoting
exposure of the gills (fig. 2a), or clamped against the
foot, shielding the gills and undoubtedly decreasing
their efficiency (fig. 2b). The latter behavior is
generally avoided, except in response to a local disturbance
or to critical levels of desiccation. Normally, as observed
in the laboratory, the girdle is partially raised along
one side of the foot. In contrast, Tonicella maintains
a shallower pallial groove of constant shape, with the
smooth thin girdle pressed flat against the substrate
and lifted only locally as entrance and exit ports for
water circulation. There is no active response to shield
gills from desiccation.
Responses to exposure were studied as chitons
clinging to horizontal glass plates were taken out of
water. It was found that Nuttallina could hold water
