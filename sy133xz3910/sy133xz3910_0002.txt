Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
air, and Tonicella lineata (Wood, 1815), which occupies
subtidal to low intertidal zones and is very rarely
uncovered. These species were compared with respect
to respiratory anatomy, efficiency of aerial respiration,
and recovery from exposure upon resubmersion, in an,
attempt to reveal possible adaptive advantages of
Nuttallina over Tonicella under humid exposed conditions.
ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS
The general anatomy and function of the chiton
respiratory system has been described in detail by
Yonge (1939). Nuttallina and Tonicella were examined
for variations of this basic pattern in terms of
structure, number, and orientation of the ctenidia, as
well as shape and variability of the pallial groove.
Representative cross-sections of the two species are
shown in fig. 1, along with the typical ctenidial structure
of each.
The number of ctenidia per animal is known to be
variable, but preliminary counts gave.Tonicella 22-29
and Nuttallina 30-48 ctenidia along each side of the
foot. The greater number of gills in Nuttallina, which
reaches a larger adult size, agrees with the observations
of Johnson (1969). The general morphology of the ctenidia
appears very similar in the two species, although
