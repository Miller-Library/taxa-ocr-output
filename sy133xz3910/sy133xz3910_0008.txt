Respiration in Nuttallina and Tonicella
Manometric studies confirm that Nuttallina has no
significant advantage in aerial respiration over Tonicella,
Respiration rates were equally depressed in both species.
reflecting the lessened efficiency of the gills in
minimal retained water resevoirs and in the collapsed
state. Studies of Cryptochiton stelleri showed a
greater decline in rate upon exposure, with aerial rates
averaging 3 to 5 time less than the submerged value
(Petersen and Johansen, 1973).
Preliminary experiments (unpublished) show that
Nuttallina survives longer than Tonicella under humid
exposed conditions. The nature of Nuttallina's advantage
is suggested by the observed post-exposure respiratory
behavior. The elevated oxygen consumption of Tonicella
upon resubmersion probably indicates that an oxygen debt
was accrued during the period of decreased oxygen uptake
accompanying exposure. Nuttallina has no such increase
in respiratory rate and evidently avoids anaerobiosis
during emersion periods. In this manner, it is not
forced to cope with the problems of acid-product
accumulation and eventual re-oxidation of those
products. Intertidal Cryptochiton stelleri show a
pattern of post-exposure respiration similar to that
of Nuttallina; more significantly, no accumulation
of lactate in the body fluid has been observed during
