that high tides and rough surf were necessary for sig-
nificant water exchange. A large granite plateau, sloping
from the sea, provided a permanent basin for the two pools.
Pool #1, the larger pool, was situated furthest from the
sea, having the gradually sloping plateau as a bottom.
The
much smaller Pool #2, positioned very near the seaward
edge of the granite plateau, occupied a small depression
on the sloping granite surface (see fig. 1). Pool f2 was
more frequently disturbed by wave action, and appeared to
be a less extreme environment than Pool fl, which was
situated at the highest level occupied by L. scutulata.
A square wooden quadrat frame (lmx 1m) subdivided into
100 10 x 10cm squares with nylon line was placed about one
inch above Pool l in an open area with a gradual slope
(see fig. 1). This Quadrat (#1) was positioned so the
border line between the third and fourth rows of squares
corresponded roughly to the normal water level. An observer
could look down over the grid and count the number of snails
within each square. Snail counts were made at various times
and under various conditions during 24 hour diel cycles and
25 hour tidal cycles, paying particular attention to periods
of significant environmental change (eg. dawn, dusk, higher
high tide, etc.). A contour map of the quadrat l area was
made by measuring depths within each 10 x 10cm square with
a ruler (fig. 2), and an average depth for each square
calculated (fig. 3).
For the smaller pool (Pool #2), the rough terrain
