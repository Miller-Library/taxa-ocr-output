the low high tide 6:30 AM, while there was an upward move-
ment at the high-high tide the preceding evening.
Experiment #3 results were gathered using a plexiglass
overlay. The population (see fig. 8) migrated downward
with approaching dawn, as is evident in the population
changes at the 1-2cm depth range and the 3-Acm depth range;
the snails were already in their normal position by 5:00 PM
the previous evening. Snail movements show some correlation
with changes in temperature and oxygen concentration. However,
the observations were preceded by rough seas, high tides,
and considerable flooding of Pool #2. Wave splash into
Pool #2 also occurred during the period 8:00 PM tol midnight
of the first day, which may have inhibited normal migratory
behavior.
Experiment 4 was similar to #3 except that very little
flooding of Pool +2 preceded the observations and no splash
occurred during the experiment itself. The population (see
fig. 9) shows a very obvious migration upward at dusk and
downward at dawn. Note particularly the progressive con-
centration of the snail population in the 0-2cm depth range
at nightfall, and the significant shift downward in the early
morning hours. This migration, once again, parallels
fluctuations in light intensity, oxygen concentration, and
tidal levels.
The foregoing observations show that numerous pool-
dwelling L. scutulata migrate upward in the evening and
downward at dawn, a movement correlated well with the light
