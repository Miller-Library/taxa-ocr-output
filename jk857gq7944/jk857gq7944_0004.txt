prevented the use of a simple quadrat frame. In early
experimentation counts were made only of animals in and
out of water, and in crevices. For later studies a transÂ¬
parent plexiglass overlay was cut to fit the pool and
surrounding edges, and divided into 4cm x Acm squares.
By looking down upon this quadrat (42) snail counts within
each square could be made. A contour map was also made for
Pool #2 (see fig. 4), and an average depth for each square
calculated (see fig. 5).
Various environmental parameters were monitored during
one or more of the experiments. Initially the Winkler
titration method (Carrit and Carpenter, 1966) was used to
determine dissolved oxygen concentrations within the tide
pools. This method proved unsatisfactory for extended
field study and therefore a portable oxygen meter and
electrode were later employed (Yellow Springs Instrument
Co. model #54). A LI-COR photometer (model LI-185) was
used to measure light intensities throughout the diurnal
cycle. The salinity of the tide pools was measured using
an American Optical Co. refractometer. Temperatures were
recorded by a Weather Measure mercury thermometer.
I. DIEL MOVEMENTS
To study L. scutulata's migration during the diel
cycle, one observation was carried out on Pool fl; the
results are shown in figure 6. Three additional experiments
were carried out on Pool #2. The results for these
