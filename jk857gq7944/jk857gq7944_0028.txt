FIGURE 6--
Population distribution plot of Experiment fl
April 25-26, 1977. Average depth on vertical
axis for every integral depth as taken from
average depth plot of Quadrat #l (see fig. 3).
Time of day on horizontal axis in intervals
corresponding to sampling times of above
population distribution. Population densit
at eight depth ranges (eg. 0-1cm., 1-2cm., etc.)
plotted horizontally at corresponding depth
for a specific sampling time. Qualitative
light cycle plotted at top of figure. Water
exchange data bar and tidal level at bottom
of figure.
