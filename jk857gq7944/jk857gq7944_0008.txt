Salinity decreases from 45%0 to 35 %0, and there is a
similar drop in temperature (160 to 11°0.). Oxygen con¬
centration decreased from 15.9 ppm to 11.2 ppm. These
parameters may be important especially when considering
that most snails are normally submerged at 1:30 PM in the
afternoon.
The migration of L. scutulata into the more protected
region of the pool with increased turbulence and related
effects in experiment #5 may be of selective advantage.
It would help the snails avoid displacement by wave action
to an environment not suited for L. scutulata.
