ITRODUCTION
The small gastropod Littorina scutulata (Gould 1949),
is a conspicuous inhabitant of the upper intertidal zone
of the West Coast of the United States. Minimal research
has been done on its short-term behavior patterns. The
only significant works address differential rates of
migration in animals of different sizes (Chow, 1975), and
migration up or down with the tidal cycle (Glynn, 1965).
Preliminary observations of Littorina scutulata in
the field at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California
suggested further study of migration patterns would be
desirable. A tendency to move up and out of the high
tide pools around dusk, and a tendency to move downward
with approaching dawn, were noted. The questions arose,
does the L. scutulata population undergo a diurnal
migration, and if so how consistent is it, and with what
environmental changes are movements correlated? The
purpose of this study was to provide data answering these
questions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A study site was chosen near the western tip of
Mussel Point, on the grounds of Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, California. The two pools studied were
located in a region exposed to strong wave action, but
high enough in the intertidal zone (three to four feet
above the Balanus-Endocladia belt: see Glynn, 1965) so
