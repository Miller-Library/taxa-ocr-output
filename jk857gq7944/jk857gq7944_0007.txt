regime as well as other physical parameters that vary
accordingly. Any correlation between tidal cycle (semiÂ¬
diurnal) and the snail's migration pattern (diurnal) seems
to be coincidental.
II. RESPONSE TO TURBULENCE
To separate the effects of turbulence and water ex-
change from those of other factors that might influence the
diel cycle of movement in L. scutulata, an experiment was
performed. At a high tide period on May 19, 1:30 PM, arti-
ficial turbulence was induced by flooding Pool #2 with
approximately one quart of fresh seawater every 30 seconds.
dumped in from the seaward side. In this attempt to simulate
natural water exchange, the distribution of the snail pop-
ulation was recorded every half hour for three hours. The
results for this experiment (45) are shown in figures 10 and
11.
The snails show a marked migration from the O-2cm depth
range to the greatest depths of Pool #2, which correlates
well with the continual artificial turbulence. The major
pathways of migration are schematically represented in figure
11. Note the population is concentrated at very shallow
depths at 1:30 PM and shifts to the greatest depths by 4:00 PM.
This migration is particularly significant since no major
migration of L. scutulata was ever seen in the early afternoon
under normal conditions.
Other changing environmental parameters correlated with
snail movements here might possibly influence snail behavior,
