SUMMARY
1. Studies of diel cycles of migration and of responses
to turbulence were made on the marine snail Littorina
scutulata at Pacific Grove, California.
2.
Snail populations in pools undergo an upward migration
correlating well with approaching darkness and a
reciprocal downward migration correlating with dawn.
Some other physical parameters fluctuate with the
light cycle (e.g. oxygen concentration, temperature,
etc.) and these might also influence the migration.
4. A migration of snails to the depths of a tide pool
subjected experimentally to turbulence was noted.
This response may be of adaptive advantage in avoiding
displacement in unfavorable situations.
