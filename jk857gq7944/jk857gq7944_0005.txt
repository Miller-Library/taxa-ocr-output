experiments (f2-4) are presented in figures 7-9.
Figure +6 shows that L. scutulata was engaging in a
migration correlating with the diel cycle. In the transition
from afternoon to darkness (5:30 PM-8:00 PM) a noticeable
upward migration of L. scutulata occurred. Note the decrease
in population in the 4-7cm depth range and the corresponding
increase in animals in the 0-3cm depth range. A reciprocal
migration downward in the transition from darkness to dawn
is not clear from these data. Pool l was situated in
L. scutulata's uppermost intertidal range, and for this
reason atypical behavior of its inhabitants was suspected.
Pool f2 was used in all further experiments.
The results of experiment #2 (see fig. #7) show a
definite shift in population upward and out of the pool
during the transition from day to night. This migration
correlates reasonably well with the temperature curve.
the temperature decreasing abruptly with the onset of dark-
ness as the snails move upward. The increase in temperature
at dawn is considerably more gradual, and the correlation
with the snail's downward migration less distinct. The high
tides at this date occurred near dawn and dusk. Does the
tidal cycle itself influence L. scutulata's migration? If
it does, a bimodal curve might be expected, with upwardmove-
ment accompanying the two high tides and downward movement
accompanying the two low tides as reported by Glynn (1965).
However, the migration data show no downward migration at
the high low tide at 12:45 AM, and a downward migration at
