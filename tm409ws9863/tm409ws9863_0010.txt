ochraceous, to be oriented at 76° at minimum extension and 6° at
maximum extension. If we assume similar angles of 80° and
10° for Pycnapodia, percent decreases in width during extension
would be as follows:
At 80°, width = 100%
At 45°, width = 72%
(Denny, pers. comm.)
At 10°, width - 17.3%
One can see that widths change very little during at
least the first half of extension, but much more noticeably
during the second half. This reflects the observation that
below about a 200% increase in length, no discernible change
in width was recorded. From 200% to 254% however, tube foot
width is seen to decrease.
This simple but illustrative exercise fails to account
for strains in the helical fibers. No doubt stretching goes
on during extension and this must be taken into consideration.
Nonetheless, this concept plays a major role in explaining
the observed strains in tube foot width during extension.
