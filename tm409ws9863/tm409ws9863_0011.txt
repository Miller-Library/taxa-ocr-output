Conclusion
1. A direct tube foot to ampulla volume displacement supports
the existence of a one-way valve (Smith, 1946). The tube foot¬
ampulla system is isovolumetric.
2. Tube foot wall thicknesses increase with contraction.
£ = 0.5 at 54% extension.
3. Tube feet at maximum contraction lose about 88% of their
extended volume. Ampullae can increase in volume to roughly
1110%.
4. The ampulla has longitudinal and circular fibers but none
helically wrapped.
5. The limit of tube foot contraction is probably due to
maximum contractility of its longitudinal muscles, Extensjon
is limited by muscular contraction of the ampulla (j.e.
restricted by total internal volume).
6. Extensile capabilities of the tube feet are greatly
enhanced by helically wrapped fibers,
