within two more days. (Kozloff, 1971)
In preparation for sectioning the arms in the cryostat,
they were slowly taken up into distilled water by a Magruder
osmotic gradient apparatus and then soaked in a solution of
10% gum arabic in 50% saturated sugar solution. (Kozloff,
1971) The arms were frozen at -25° C. in the microtome for
twelve hours before sectioning.
Sections were made longitudinally through the tube
foot and ampulla (figure 3). Measurements of their internal
geometry were made by using an ocular ruler. Volumes were
then calculated.
III. Volume Exchange
In determining how water volume is exchanged throughout
contraction and extension, I needed to obtain similar sections
from tube feet in their most extended and contracted states.
This was accomplished by instantly freezing amputated ambulacra
in liquid nitrogen. Fixation was done at -20°C. in a solution
of 37% formalin in 70% alcohol. Decalcification and preparation
were repeated as before.
in the microtome proved difficult so
Sectioning
tube feet of various lengths were cut radially by hand with
fine micro scissors. Hall thicknesses were measured at 100%,
75%, and 54% longitudinal extension of the tube foot. Strain
W-
values were calculated by the formula £ -
where g
is strain (a percentage change value), W is new wall width and
W. is the wall width at maximum tube foot extension.
