Materials and Methods
I. Filming
To observe the tube foot and ampulla in operation, am¬
bulacra of Pycnapodia were amputated and a viewing window was
cut into the side (figure 1). Video films were recorded and
three events showing clear and dramatic contraction and
extension were chosen for analysis.
The tube foot and its associated ampulla were care¬
fully traced after stopping the film every thirty to
sixty frames (0.5 - 1.0 seconds). These tracings were then
projected and retraced onto paper. The paper tracings
were retraced a third time onto an Apple II graphics
tablet digitizer. Area data of both the tube foot and
ampulla as well as the length and width of the tube foot
at intervals during contraction and extension were recorded.
The accuracy of the above measurements was determined
by first retracing the minimum possible outline of both
the tube foot and ampulla and then tracing a maximum
possible outline for the same events. Averaging the maxi¬
mum and minimum values separately gave the individual high
and low boundaries of error for areas, length, and width.
II. Volume
In order to ascertain relative volumes of the tube
foot and ampulla, ambulacra were first fixed in 37% formalin
for two days, then decalcified in a solution of 3% HCI in
70% ethanol for seven to fourteen days. Neutralization in
70% alcohol with KCO, added as needed was accomplished
