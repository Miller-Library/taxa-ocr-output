maximum extension (200%), how is it that a tube foot can
attain extensions of 254% as was recorded for one of the
three filmed events? This is explained in figure 5.
A tube foot at minimum extension with dimensions
2 mm. x 1.5 mm. is increased in volume by 88%. If its walls
were constructed of an ISOTROPIC material,the stress would be
twice as high in the hoop direction as in the longitudinal
direction. Thus it would increase in the circumference twice
as much as it does in length (Wainwright et al, 1976).
If the tube foot were to remain a RIGID HOOP as v√¥lume
increased, it would attain a two-fold increase in length as
was observed for two of the three filmed events. The third
event, however, (MAXIMUM OBSERVED, figure 5), revealed a
further extension of up to 254%, and a discernible decrease
in width to 78% (+3,8%, -9.3%).
Tang (1983) and Shibata (1983) have both recorded helically
wound fibers in the tube feet of Asteroids. Shibata's work
was done on Pycnapodia tube feet. These helically wrapped
fibers are depicted in figure 4 and probably allow the tube
foot to attain further extension by constricting the tube foot
in width.
To better understand this concept one must recognize
that these helical fibers become packed together so that they
lie nearly horizontal at maximum tube foot contraction. As
the tube foot extends, the angles between the fibers and the
longitudinal axis of the tube foot decrease.
Tang (1983) has reported helical fibers in Pisaster
