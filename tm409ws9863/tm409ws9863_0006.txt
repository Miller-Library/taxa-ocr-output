Relative areas, which are proportional to volumes, of
three distinct tube foot-ampulla systems during contraction and
extension are depicted in figure 2 (time intervals are
roughly the same between each point: 0.5 - 1.0 seconds).
The data from each of the three filmed events fit lines of
similar slope (-0.54, -0.81, -0.88 with linear regressions of
-0.68, -0.92, -0.88 respectively) indicating that volume
is immediately and directly displaced from the tube foot to the
ampulla and back during contraction and extension.
This proves that the system is isovolumetric, which adds
confirmation to the existence of a one-way valve reported
by Smith (1946).
To determine how volume in the tube foot changed
during contraction, areas of the model in figure 3 were matched
to those of the filmed event f878 in its most extended
condition. For the model:
Ampulla area - 2.3 mm + 10%)
Tube foot area = 9.9 mm (+ 10%)
For 1878 (at maximum extension):
Ampulla area - 2.3 mmÂ° (49.4%, -4,3%)
Tube foot area = 9.22 mm (+10.3%, -5.6%)
Ampulla areas are identical and tube foot areas agree within
95% confidence intervals. Volumes are therefore assumed to
be identical.
Wall thickness of the tube feet from arms frozen in
liquid nitrogen was found to increase during tube foot
contraction. The strain value at 53% (minimum) extension
is 0.5 (+ 0.07).
