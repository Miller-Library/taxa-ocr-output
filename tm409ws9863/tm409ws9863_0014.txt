Figure 1: The viewing window cut into the side of a Pycna¬
podia ambulacrum to facilitate filming of the entire tube foot¬
ampulla system in operation.
Figure 2: Graph of tube foot vs. ampulla areas during
tube foot contraction and extension. Tube foot area per¬
centage errors are +10.3%, -5.6%; ampulla area percentage
errors are +9.4%, -4.3%.
Figure 3: Cross-section of the model tube foot-ampulla
system.
Figure 4: Morphology of the Ampulla.
Figure 5: Tube foot extension for tube feet of different
physical characteristics given an internal volume increase of
88% from the ORIGINAL volume. Helically wound fibers are
responsible for the MAXIMUM OBSERVED tube foot as illustrated.
