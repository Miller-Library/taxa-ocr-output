The wall strain at 53% extension being known, the
thickness of the walls of 1878 at 53% extensjon could
be calculated. Subtracting this figure from the obseryed
tube foot total width at 53% extension of 1878 gave the Jumen
width, and finally its volume was calculated.
At 53% extension, the tube foot lumen volume of 1878
has decreased by 88% from full extension. The ampulla at
53% tube foot extension has increased in volume by 1110%,
Study of ampulla morphology reveals only longitudinal
and circular fibers oriented at 902 to each other (figure 44
and B). No helically wound fibers were found. During ampulla
contraction, the outer longitudinal fibers become crimped
into waves and the inner circular fibers arrange themselves
in the troughs of these waves.
The innermost layer of tissue is muscle bundles. Separate
bands of muscle radiate from the top of the ampulla until they
form a continuous sheath about half-way down (figure 4C and D).
Presumably this is to allow for greater ampulla expansion by
reducing the limitations of diametric muscle stretch.
