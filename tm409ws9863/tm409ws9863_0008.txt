Discussion
From the value of 1110% increase in ampulla volume at
maximum tube foot contraction, it is obvious that the ampulla
is capable of withstanding a very great strain (£ - 9.2).
Maximum strains in the longitudinal and circular fibers
are unknown but are probably not the limiting factors in
tube foot contraction.
Since the tube foot volume at maximum contraction was
reduced to 12% of that at full extension, very little more
could be realistically squeezed out without collapsing the
tube foot altogether. What seems more probable as the
limiting factor in tube foot contraction is the maximum
contractility of the longitudinal muscles in the tube
foot. This hypothesis, however, requires verification.
The tube feet can be physically stretched to much greater
than their maximally observed extension of 254%, and afterward
retürn to normal operation. This then rules out the maximum strain
of the longitudinal fibers limiting extension as is hypo¬
thesized for ophiuroid tube feet by Woodley (Wainwright et
al, 1976).
When one observes the ampulla in figure 3 at 8.5% its
maximal ly expanded volume, it appears that it must be approach-
ing very closely its maximum contraction. What seems most
likely then, is that maximum tube foot extension is limited
by the contractility of muscles in the ampulla, or more
precisely, the finite volume of the system.
If the model tube foot in figure 3 is at very near
