Introduction
The tube feet and ampullae are the extremities of
the water vascular system in Echinoderms. Water enters
the system through a madrepore on the dorsal side of the
oral disc. Some of this water is channeled out the arms
of the organism through radial canals. These canals
are the common ducts to which all of the tube feet and
ampullae are connected.
The tube feet-ampullae systems of Asteroids are reported
to be isovolumetric. A muscularly controlléd, one-way
valve (Smith, 1946) allows water to enter from the radial
canal to compensate for diffusion. This valve then
closes, trapping a finite volume inside,
Physical properties of the tube foot have received
much attention lately, but the morphology of the ampullae
and how it coordinates activity with the tube foot de¬
serves further examination.
This study attempts to correlate physical characteri¬
stics of the ampullae and tube foot in Pycnapodja heljan¬
thoides with actual behaviour of the tube foot-ampulla
system in operation.
Studjes recently undertaken by others at the Hopkins
Marine Station: Tang (unpub. 1983), Shibata (unpub. 1983),
as well as by Smith (1946) and Woodley (1979) will be
analyzed as they relate to findings in this study.
