Area measurements of the model section used for the
volume calculations in Part II above were matched with a
tube foot and ampulla from one of the three filmed events.
The model fit tube foot 1878 in its most extended state, so
using the wall strain data, total wall thickness at 54% extension
could be calculated.
Hall thickness was then subtracted from the observed
tube foot total width at 54% contraction to give average
internal width. The internal tube foot volume was cal¬
culated as Irl, where r - lumen radius, and L = tube foot
length.
IV. Ampulla Morphology
The morphology of the ampulla was studied. Tts muscu¬
lature could easily be determined by direct observation.
These muscles were then separated from the ampullae with fine
forceps after briefly soaking them in a 1:1 solution of IM
KOH and glycerol (Woodley, 1967). The remaining tissue was
then observed with an Aus Jena polarizing light microscope.
