Abstract
This study attempts to correlate mechanical characteristics of
the tube feet and ampullae in Pycnopodia helianthoides with filmed
behaviour of the tube foot-ampulla system in operation. The tube
foot-ampulla system is an isovolumetric system. Tube foot wall
thickness increases during contraction (Â£ = 0.5 at 54% extensjon).
lube feet at maximum contraction lose about 88% of their extended
volume. The ampullae simultaneously expand in volume by roughly
1110%.
Longitudinal and circular fibers were found in the ampulla. The
maximum strain for these fibers is as yet undetermined, but what
limits tube foot contraction is more likely the maximum contractility
of tube foot longitudinal muscles. Tube foot extension is limited by
contraction of the ampulla (i.e. restricted by total internal volume
of the system). Helically unmapped fibers in the tube foot
greatly enhance its extensile capability.
