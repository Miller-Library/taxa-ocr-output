Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
polychaete nickel concentration to concentrations in the sand
are consistently in the range of .330 - .784, except for the
ratios of T. gigas to the sand which are 8.30 and 4.09 (Table 1).
Copper: Copper levels in the sand showed little varia¬
bility from transect to transect, with a range of 1 ppm. - 6
ppm. The polychaetes showed a ratio to the sand of over one,
ranging from 3.00 to 12.6 (Table 1). The species with the
highest ratios are Nerinides acuta with 24.0, Nephtys califor-
niensis with 23.0 and Euzonus mucronata with 93.0. N. acuta
and E. mucronata also showed the highest overall copper con¬
centrations of any species with 63 ppm. and 300 ppm. respec¬
tively (Fig. 5).
Manganese: The levels in the sand were all over 10 ppm.
with the highest concentration being 33 ppm. Manganese levels
in the polychaetes were consistent from species to species
ranging from 4 ppm. to 15 ppm. None of the ratios show any
significant concentration of manganese in the polychaetes.
Iron: Sand levels of iron were consistent with higher
levels occuring at the boat works beach, 1400 ppm. and the
harbor beach, 1500 ppm. The iron levels in any given species
of polychaete were intraspecifically consistent from beach to
beach. E. dillonensis and E. mucronata show a range of 750
ppm. to 860 ppm. T. gigas with a range of 350 ppm. to 420
ppm. and C. spirabrancha from the harbor showed the highest
levels of up to 1700 ppm.; N. acuta and C. spirabrancha showed
a ratio of 1 to the sand levels, and all others were from .10
- .75.
