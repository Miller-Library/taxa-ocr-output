Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
The Monterey marina is directly adjacent to the Del Monte
beach transect and the Monterey Boat Works is above the tran¬
sect at Hopkins Marine Station. These are sources of environ¬
mental pollution. It is interesting to note that the highest
concentrations of lead and iron were found on the sand from
these beaches.
The polychaetes can be separated into accumulators and
non-accumulators with respect to each metal. T. gigas seems
to be the only nickel accumulator out of the six species
studied.
The consistently high ratios of copper found in the
worms seems to indicate copper may be used in all of the
species studied, possibly as a metallo-enzyme. Vinogradov
(1953) cites evidence for a copper metallo-enzyme in annelids.
The accumulators of copper seem to be Nephtys californiensis,
E. mucronata and Nerinides acuta. These species show a ratio
to the sand of an order of magnitude greater than the other
species.
All species seem to be non-accumulators of manganese as
indicated by the ratios in Table 1.
Annelids use three iron containing pigments, haemoglobin,
chlorocruorin and haemerythrin (Dales, 1963), which accounts
for the intraspecific consistency in the iron levels from
transect to transect. The C. spirabrancha from the harbor
shows a greater ratio of iron to the sand than C. spirabrancha
from the Boat Works beach. This may reflect the presence of
sand particles rich in iron in the gut or accumulation by the
