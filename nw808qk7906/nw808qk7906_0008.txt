Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
Summary
There is evidence to suggest accumulation of nickel in
T. gigas. Copper is accumulated in Nephtys californiensis,
E. mucronata and Nerinides acuta. Accumulation of zinc takes
place in N. californiensis, E. dillonensis and N. acuta.
Lead accumulation seems to take place in E. mucronata. This
study shows that zinc and copper are in consistently high
levels in the worms as opposed to the sand and this may sugÂ¬
gest some use by the worms such as a metallo-enzyme.
