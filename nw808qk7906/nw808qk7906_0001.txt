Introduction
Studies of trace metal levels in marine organisms have
shown that toxic metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury are
concentrated by many marine organisms (reviews by Vinogradov,
1953; Goldberg, 1965). Except for the studies of Bryan and
Hummerstone (1971) on tolerance levels in Nereis diversicolor
(MÃ¼ller), Cross et al. (1970) on manganese, iron and zinc in
estuarine polychaetes, and Phelps (1966) on iron, zinc,
scandium and samarium, no research has been initiated on
trace elements in polychaetes. This study is an investigation
of levels of nickel, copper, cadmium, lead, iron, zinc and
manganese in six species of typical beach polychaetes of
Monterey Bay. Specific sampling sites were chosen so that
known point sources of pollution in south Monterey Bay might
be included in the survey.
Materials and methods
Collection sites on seven beaches in south Monterey Bay
(Fig. 1) in an area extending from Hopkins Marine Station to
Holiday Inn were chosen for study. These included the boat
