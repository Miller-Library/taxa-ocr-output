Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
worm. However, the relatively consistent levels of iron in
the same species coupled with the use of iron suggests regu¬
lation of iron in the polychaetes independent of the levels
in the sand.
The zinc accumulators seem to be N. californiensis and
Nerinides acuta. The six species studied contain higher con¬
centrations than the sand. Phelps (1966) suggests accumula¬
tion of zinc in nine species of benthic polychaetes. They
also show consistently high ratios of tissue zinc levels to
the levels in the sand. Bryan and Hummerstone (1971) and
Cross et al. (1970) give evidence for regulation of zinc con¬
centrations in polychaetes independent of the sand levels.
The data from this study seems to justify such an hypothesis.
All species studied appear to accumulate lead and cadmium
above the levels found in the sand. E. mucronata seems to be
the largest accumulator of lead. It is interesting to note
that E. mucronata is also the largest accumulator of copper.
While strongly suggestive, the data presented is not
sufficient to confirm accumulation of these metals in the
polychaetes investigated. This is a result of the time limit
of six weeks and the scarcity of two of the species. (N. cali¬
forniensis and T. gigas occur in a density of approximately
1 per 1/4 m2 (Anderson et al., 1972).) Further research should
be initiated to confirm the suspected accumulation of these
metals. Nickel and iron levels in annelids suggested by Bowen
(1971) are consistent with the levels recorded in this study.
