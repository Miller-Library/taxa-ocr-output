Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
works beach next to Hopkins Marine Station, the Monterey
marina beach between wharf number one and two, a beach 500
yds, east of wharf number two, the Del Monte Apts. beach,
the U.S.N.P.G.S. beach, the beach at the Monterey sewage pipe
and the last, 50 yds. southwest of Holiday Inn in Monterey.
Polychaetes were collected by sifting sand through a 1/8 inch
plastic screen until sufficient numbers of organisms of a
given species were obtained. Sand samples were also collected
from those specific levels where each species was taken for
later analysis. Specific sites for species were taken from a
polychaete distribution study of south Monterey Bay by Anderson
et al. (1972). The six species studied were:
Cirriformia spirabrancha Moore, 1904
Euzonus dillonensis Hartman, 1938
Euzonus mucronata Treadwell, 1914
Nephtys californiensis Hartman, 1938
Nerinides acuta Treadwell, 1914
Travisia gigas Hartman, 1938
The worms were washed in seawater for 24 to 48 hours to
purge them of attached sand and to allow removal of sand from
the digestive tracts. The organisms were then dried for 12
hours at 72Â°C. They were subsequently ground to a powder with
mortar and pestle and sifted through .5 mm. nylon netting.
One gram samples were weighed out into 30 ml. beakers. Ten
ml. of 90% HNO3 was added and the sample left uncovered under
a hood for one hour. Samples were then refluxed one hour and
evaporated to a volume of 5 ml. Five ml. of H90, was added
