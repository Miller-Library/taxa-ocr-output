Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
dropwise until bubbling stopped and the resulting solution
was evaporated to a final volume of 5 ml. One ml. of con¬
centrated HCl was then added and the solution was diluted to
25 ml. with distilled water. Sand samples were digested in
the same manner in order to compare levels in the sand en¬
vironment with those in the polychaetes studied. The digested
samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
All collections of the polychaetes were pooled and two
one gram subsamples were taken from the pooled tissue samples.
All of the polychaetes studied are substrate ingestors
with the exception of Nephtys californiensis, which is a
predator. Feeding type was determined, in the case of the
substrate ingestors, by dissection of the gut and microscopic
analysis. N. californiensis was observed feeding on nematodes
and other polychaetes.
Results
The results are presented in Figures 2-10 and Table 1.
The elements will be discussed individually.
Nickel: The nickel concentrations in the sand remain
relatively consistent from beach to beach in a range of 4 ppm.
to 10 ppm. (Fig. 2). Nickel levels do not vary greatly with
different polychaete species showing a range of 3 ppm. to 7
ppm. (Fig. 4). The one exception to this is the opheliid
Travisia gigas. At two different locations the levels in
this polychaete are much higher (27 ppm. and 55 ppm.) than
those seen in the other species (Fig. 4). The ratio of
