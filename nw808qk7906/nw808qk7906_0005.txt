Trace metals in beach Polychaetes
Zinc: Levels of zinc in the sand were inconsistent from
transect to transect, but showed a range of 6 ppm. to 32 ppm.
The levels in the worms showed intraspecific consistency
similar to that found with the iron levels. E. dillonensis
had a range of 100 ppm. to 160 ppm. T. gigas had a range of
30 ppm. - 60 ppm. C. spirabrancha had 70 ppm. at both sites.
The highest levels occur in N. acuta and Nephtys californiensis
with 250 ppm. and 240 ppm. respectively. The ratios of the
worm levels to the sand levels were all greater than 1:1
ranging from 3.06 to 3.14. The highest ratios were in N.
californiensis, E. dillonensis from the U.S.N.P.G.S. and N.
acuta.
Lead: Sand levels were only detectable on the harbor
beach and at the boat works beach. All species showed con¬
sistent levels of lead from 8 ppm. to 11 ppm. with the ex¬
ception of E. dillonensis and E. mucronata which had levels
of 21 ppm. and 57 ppm. respectively.
Cadmium: Cadmium was not detectable in the sand at any
of the sampling sites. All species analyzed contained cadmium
with the highest level in E. dillonensis of 11 ppm.
Discussion
All of the metal levels in the sand found in this study
are consistent with surface sand levels found in a study by
Koski (1972), with iron, zinc and manganese occuring in the
greatest concentrations.
