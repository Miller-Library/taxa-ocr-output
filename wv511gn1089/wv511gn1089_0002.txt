INTRODUCTION:
The brown cat shark Apristurus brunneus is a benthic shark found
in eastern Pacific waters from depths of 200 to over 1000 meters,
documented as high as 200 meters above the bottom (Geen and Jones,
1976; Roedel, 1950; DeLacy and Chapman, 1935). It is known that this
shark lives in or near the Monterey Bay due to sightings, sharks caught on
lines and in trawlls, and more frequently, sightings and samplings of its
egg cases. Very little is known about A.brunneus since it was impossible
to study live specimens of deep sea organisms such as this until recently.
MBARI (see Appendix 1) and its unmanned submersible, the ROV
Ventana, along with others like it, have provided most of the material for
education about this animal.
Gilbert Van Dykhuizen, Senior Aquarist at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium, has been studying this shark, among others, for nearly six
years. His most recent focus has been on its embryonic development;
something which had not been studied in this organism previously. The
focus of my research was to find the preferred habitat and distribution of
this cat shark egg in Monterey Bay.
