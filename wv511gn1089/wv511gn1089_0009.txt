none of the predators ate their way into the egg, it is believed that, in a
more extensive study of this, some of these organisms would prey upon
the cat shark egg. In fact, Caliostoma has been observed doing just that in
Van Dykhuizen's lab (unpublished, pers. comm.).
Finally, if the frequency of sightings is decreasing due to the
existence of fewer eggs we may face a major decline in the local population
of Apristurus brunneus. This shark is only present off the western coast of
North America, from British Columbia to southern California (Geen and
Jones, 1976) and (Roedel, 1950). If the population in Monterey Bay is being
destroyed by predation upon its eggs, how are we to know that this is not
ocurring elsewhere? At the very least, the population genetics of this
species would be greatly altered by the disappearance of this, a central rung
on its ladder.
