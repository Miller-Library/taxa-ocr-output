MATERIALS AND METHODS:
General: Distributional research was conducted at MBARI, through
videos taken over a three year period from March 1989 until March 1992.
These findings are based on contact and recordings made with the ROV.
Later studies on egg case predation was conducted in the Deeps Sea lab at
the Monterey Bay Aquarium under the guidance of Gilbert Van
Dykhuizen, Senior Aquarist.
Sightings: Distribution was determined using the number of
sightings rather than the number of egg cases present in each sighting.
Most footage of A.brunneus egg cases shows the communal sites, where a
number of females have chosen the same site for egg laying, while others
show only one or two egg cases. Over all, the number of eggs found in
communal sites is far greater than the number of individual egg cases
sighted.
Multiple sightings within one dive were counted if and only if it
could be determined that there was no possibility of counting the same egg
case twice. This is to say that two sightings one minute apart but at the
same depth (within one meter of each other) and presumably in or on the
same substrate in the same area would be counted as one. It is quite
common for the ROV to lose and then regain sight of the same egg case,
and often difficult to prove either way.
Bottom Time: Bottom time is based upon the number of video
tapes of a given length recorded during a dive. All benthic dives have had
