ABSTRACT:
This paper discusses the distribution of the egg case of the cat shark
Apristurus brunneus in Monterey Bay. There is a focus on depth
distribution as well as preferred substrate for egg laying. In addition to the
distributional findings, this study has pointed out further questions, eg. is
the number of egg cases in Monterey Bay declining? Also addressed is the
possibility of predation of the egg case ocurring in nature.
