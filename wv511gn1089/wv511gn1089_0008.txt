would be interesting to research the whereabouts of those who laid these
eggs as well as where these juveniles go after exiting their case.
Another interesting direction for further investigation might be
why sponges are the preferred substrate for egg case laying. It can be seen,
through ROV videos, that the egg cases have a detrimental effect on
sponges, and large deposits of egg cases smother the sponge upon which
they are laid. One possibile explanation deals with the relationship
between the community near the sponge and the developing embryo.
Since the area is productive, there is a great deal of interaction between the
organisms and the egg case. It is possible that this is advantageous to a
newly released juvenile shark.
Perhaps the greatest question raised by this research deals with
predation of the eggs. It has been seen through sightings and samples that
many of the eggs have holes in them. There seem to be two types of holes
commonly found in the egg cases. One is small (1 to 5 mm in diameter)
and round with smooth edges and usually found on the face of an egg
case, the other is larger (up to 10 mm) and uneven in shape with rough
edges (see Figures 6A and 6B). It is possible that the latter of these holes is
simply the former after given a substantial amount of decay time.
By studying the organisms commonly associated with the
A.brunneus egg case we can create a list of possible predators which
include the deep sea stars Stylasterias and Rathbunaster as well as
Allocentrotus, a deep sea urchin, and a number of predatory snails
including Neptunea amianta, Neptunea ithia, Colus, and Caliostoma.
Brief experiments were conducted in the Monterey Bay Aquarium
wherein a few of one type of the possible predators were set in a small tank
with two cat shark eggs which were affixed to a rock. Though in the lab
