Figure 5: Egg Case Sightings by Substrate.
This pie chart depicts that nearly three quarters of all
A.brunneus eggs sighted by ROV have ocurred on one type of sponge or
another.
Figure 6A: Number of Holes per Egg Case.
Of the seven egg cases with holes in the Monterey Bay
Aquarium, one had one hole, three had two holes, two had four holes,
and one had five holes.
Figure 6B: Hole Size and Type.
Though not a complete representation of all the holes seen,
this depicts the size of the holes in the egg cases in the Aquarium and
whether the hole is round or rough. Black squares stand for the round
holes, white represents rough holes.
