ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I would like to thank the entire staff of MBARI, especially Lynn
Lewis for her guidance with the videos and all those who may have been
inconvenienced by my moving in to the video room for many late nights.
My other second home these past weeks became the Monterey Bay
Aquarium and I certainly owe many thanks to everyone who helped me
out there, especially Teri Buroker for her warm smiles and Gilbert Van
Dykuizen not only for loaning me space in his lab, but for always
encouraging me and somehow knowing when to give me advice and
when the best advice was for me to come up with my own answers. I
want to thank everyone I have gotten to know at Hopkins Marine Station,
and even those whom I never officially met. I have never been around a
more dynamic group of people and I only hope I brought to them half of
what they gave me: David Epel, Mark Denny, Alan Baldridge, Susan
Harris, Judy Thompson, and everyone else (especially my six and one half
roommates). Finally, I extend a warm thank you to Chuck Baxter without
whom I wouldn't have the courage to follow my dreams.
