RESULTS:
Sightings: Between March, 1989,when the first sighting of an
A.brunneus egg case was reported by MBART's ROV, and March, 1992
there have been 304 individual sightings of cat shark egg cases. Of these,
119 were in 1989, 142 were in 1990, 35 were in 1991 and so far only 8 have
been in 1992. See Figure 1.
Bottom Time: Bottom time on benthic dives ranged from just a few
minutes to 1710 minutes. See Figure 2.
Depth: Based upon the depth readings reported by the ROV,
A.brunneus has a preferential range for laying its eggs. Though found in
depths from 151 meters to 525 meters, there is an overwhelming
abundance of egg cases from nearly 326 meters to 450 meters, with a
remarkable preference for the interval of 351 meters to 375 meters. See
Figure 4.
Substrate: Of the 86 sightings with determined substrates, ten were
on rock outcroppings, 64 were on various types of sponges, and 12 were on
miscellaneous substrates ranging from anemones to sessile debris to the
sediment slope. See Figure 5.
