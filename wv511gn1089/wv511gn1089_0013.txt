FIGURE LEGEND:
Figure 1: Egg Case Sightings by Date.
The X axis of this graph is divided into months beginning
with January 1989 and ending with March 1992. This indicates the
frequency of sightings throughout the ROV's operational time.
Figure 2: Bottom Time per Month.
This figure shows the approximate time the ROV spent on
benthic dives, at any depth. As indicated above, the months begin with
January 1989 and end with March 1992.
Figure 3: Bottom Time and Egg Case Sightings per Month.
Figure 3 correlates Figures 1 and 2; it allows us to judge the
number of sightings in comparison with the amount of time possible for
sightings. Note that the number of minutes was decreased by a power of
ten to fit on a scale with the number of egg cases sighted. The inaccuracy
created by the change in scale is great; this chart is only presented to enable
the reader to view the two above charts simultaneously.
Figure 4: Egg Case Sightings by Depth.
Depicted here is the frequency of Apristurus brunneus
sightings per 25 meter interval.
