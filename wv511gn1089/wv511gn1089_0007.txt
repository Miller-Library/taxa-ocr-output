released by the mother. The egg cases seen by the ROV, especially in
communal sites, are often old and already hatched. There is no
specification of the number of fresh egg cases.
Another major reason any patterns which may seem obvious are
false is that it is difficult to consider the opportunities provided by ROV as
constraints on the research. During months when no benthic dives were
conducted it is obvious that no egg cases could be sighted. Ã„fter the tether
was replaced and the amount of time spent on and depth of benthic dives
could be increased there is another explanation for the lack of egg case
sightings; the ROV was simply too deep to see any. A closer look at
frequency patterns could be taken if the ROV had a fixed bottom time per
month in a given area known for communal egg laying sites, and by
attempting to measure the developmental stage of the embryos it
encounters as well as the number of dead or old egg cases.
Regardless of these restrictions, the data from the ROV enabled me
to get a clear picture of the boundaries of the depth stratifications of the
A.brunneus egg in Monterey Bay. Studies have reported distribution of
the adult cat shark in British Columbia waters (Geen and Jones, 1976), off
the coast of California (Roedel, 1950), and in the Puget Sound (DeLacy and
Chapman, 1935), but never in the Bay and never concentrating on the egg
case itself. In order to use these findings more extensively, this
information could be followed by a study of the distribution of the adult
cat shark in the Bay, or of egg distribution elsewhere. Mysteriously, the
ROV has very few documented sightings of mature A.brunneus in the
Bay. Now that there are communal egg laying sites documented and the
embryonic development has been explored (Van Dykhuizen, ongoing) it
