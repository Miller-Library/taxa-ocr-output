DISCUSSION:
The frequency of sightings of the egg case from A.brunneus seems
to depict two patterns. One of these is the decreasing number of sightings
since 1990. This may or may not be an accurate conclusion to draw from
my observations. It is certainly possible that, for one reason or another,
this species of shark is not thriving in Monterey Bay now, but it seems
more likely that the results herein reported are biased by the conditions of
ROV dives.
MBARI has been trying to increase the maximum operating depth
of the ROV since its origins. Recent capabilities allow the ROV to descend
to 1000 meters whereas the maximum depth it could reach began at 500
meters and slowly decreased until it was replaced with the current tether
in September 1990. However, MBARI did not have the capacity to make
use of the long tether until the program for tether management was
entirely operational in January 1991. When compared to the depth
stratification of this cat shark egg we can see that by doing less benthic
research in 200 - 400 meter depths one would see fewer egg cases. See
figure 3.
The other pattern that can be expected to be seen is a cyclic one.
Past research has shown the ovulation period of the Apristurus brunneus
to be highest in February and March and decline until its end as late as
August (Geen and Jones, 1976). These findings were based on specimens
caught in British Columbia coastal waters. Perhaps the greatest reason
why this pattern isn't observed in the ROV's sightings is because the
results shown here concern egg cases of different ages and developmental
progress, whereas other research conducted discusses egg cases not yet
