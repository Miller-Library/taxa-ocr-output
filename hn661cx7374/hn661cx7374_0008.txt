from a particle; as shown, the soluble enzyme itself was
detergent activated). An alternate possibility however, is
that the yolk cells themselves are acidic and functioning as
a " cellular lysosome." If so, these large cells would be
broken during the homogenization procedure and release the
soluble enzyme. An extracellular function of the enzyme might
also be possible. The yolk cells are present in the midgut
during development and the midgut might be functional at this
time in utilizing yolk constituents. A problem with the above
concept of embryonic utilization is that there is no evidence
for a B-linked carbohydrate in the embryo; the major known
store is glycogen, which would be degraded by glycogen
phosphorylase or an a4-D-glucosidase (7,8).
The alternative explanation is that the enzyme is not.
used during embryogenesis but represents accumulation of the
enzyme for later use in the feeding larval stages. The role
for a B-D-glucosidase activity then could be for digesting
laminarin or cellulase, which would be major constituents of
a planktonic or detrital diet. A laminarinase has been found in the
midgut of adult barnacles, Balanus nubilus and a cellulase
is present in the " sterile midgut of adult lobster and
crawfish with a ph optimum of 4.0 to 4.5 which appears to be
much lower than the pH optimum of 5.0 to 6.0 found for other
carbohydrases (9,10,11).
Studies on synthesis of adult digestive enzymes could
