activity could be sedimented. The same 3:1 ratio of activity
was found, as in the two fractions of a 27,000 g spin. The
assay was also run with both fractions in the presence or
absence of 1% Triton X-100; an incr√©ase in enzyme activity
was seen in both insoluble and the soluble supernatant
fraction when Triton X-100 was present (1.6-fold increase).
This result indicates that the soluble enzyme is directly
activated by the detergent.
These results suggest that one enzyme is responsible for
the activity. Twenty-five percent of the enzyme appears to
be particulate and the soluble form is activated by the
detergent, Triton X-100; the effect of Triton X-100 on the
particulate fraction is related to its effect on the
solubilization of the enzyme.
A final enzyme assay was run on the intestinal tract of
the adult barnacle. The juices of the intestine were obtained
by inserting a fine-pointed pipet in the tract and extracting
the juices contained in the lumen. The tract was then removed
and homogenized. Assays were run on the juices and the
supernatant and pellet (27,000 g for 30 minutes) of the homog.
enate. The juices of the lumen contained a majority of the
activity. The homogenized gut tract showed activity in the
supernatant and pellet with a ratio of 3:1, supernatant:pellet,
as was found in the embryonic stage. All fractions (juices
and homogenized gut) were also activated by the detergent.
