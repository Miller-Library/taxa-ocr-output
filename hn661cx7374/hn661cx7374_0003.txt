The assay mixture contained 0.2 ml of 0.02M substrate, 0.2 ml
1.0% Triton X-100, 0.4 ml homogenate, and 1.2 ml buffer.
After incubation at 30°C (60 minutes unless specified other¬
wise), the reaction was terminated by addition of 1.0 ml of
O.5M Naoh. The mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 g at 0°0
for 10 minutes and the supernatant then read in a Gilford
spectrophotometer along with its corresponding blank, against
distilled water at 420 mu. The blank was prepared by adding
the homogenate together with the Naoh. The B-D-glucosidase
activity is expressed in nanomoles of p-nitrophenol liberated
per milligram protein per 60 minutes (4). Protein was
measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin
as a protein standard (5).
Results
ph Optimum and Linearity with Time
Fig, 1 shows that the maximum activity of the enzyme
occured at a pH 3.0 however, at this pH, the time course was
not linear (data not shown). The activity at pH 4.0 is
within 80% of the activity at ph 3.0 and the time course is
linear for up to 60 minutes at this pH (Fig. 2). For this
reason, the assays were done at pH 4.0 for 60 minutes.
Linearity of Rate with Protein Concentration
Fig. 3 shows that the enzyme activity is directly
