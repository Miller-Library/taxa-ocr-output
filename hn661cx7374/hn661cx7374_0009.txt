explain the 3:1 soluble:particulate nature of this enzyme
and activation by detergents. If it is indeed digestive, the
enzyme is probably being accumulated in the hepatopancreatic
gland.
In adults, digestive enzymes are stored in enzymatic
granules which are distended with fluid, forming a large
vacuole, or mature secretory cell (11,12). The contents of
these cells are extruded into the lumen for extracellular
digestion. It has been shown that a refractory period is
necessary for mature cells and enzyme granules to form (11).
The soluble activity could represent the enzyme present in
mature or almost mature secretory cells, while the particulate
activity could represent enzyme granules or newly forming cells.
Homogenization could release the enzymes from secretory cells
prematurely since it was found that even slight pressure on
the cover slip of a slide of hepatopancreatic gland cells
caused the breakage of the distended mature cells (12). As
regards activation by detergent, it is interesting that the
hepatopancreatic gland also stores and secretes bile salts
into the lumen; the activating effect of Triton X-100 might
mimic the activity of a natural detergent in the intestine(Il).
There is insufficient data to decide between these various
alternatives. Clearly, further studies on the digestive
capabilities of barnacle embryos would be of interest.
