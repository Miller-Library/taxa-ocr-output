Enzyme Compartmentalization
To determine if the enzyme is particulate at some point
in development, the homogenate of the early blastula and
motile nauplius were centrifuged (27,000 g for 30 minutes)
in the presence and absence of 0.27 Triton X-100. The
supernatants were removed by pipet and saved for later assay
of activity; the pellets were resuspended in a volume of
buffer equivalent to that of the supernatant. The assays were
then run with 1% detergent present in each mixture. Ihe
absence of Triton X-100 during the centrifugation resulted
in 75% activity in the supernatant and 25% in the pellet.
In the presence of Triton X-100, the activity shifted to 947
in the supernatant and 6% in the pellet. This behavior was
true in both stages.
A pH optimum curve, similar to Fig. 1, was run on the
supernatant and pellet (27,000 g for 30 minutes) in the
absence of Triton X-100 to determine if the soluble and
particulate activity were due to different isozymes. In the
assay mixtures buffered to pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.5, and 6.5, the
activity, in each case, was 75% supernatant and 25% pellet.
The total activity at each ph was found to be similar in ratio to the
activity found in the earlier ph optimum curve (Fig. 1).
Perhaps a 27,000 g spin was inadequate to pellet a
particulate activity. Centrifugation was therefore carried
out at 100,000 g for 60 minutes to ascertain if any additional
