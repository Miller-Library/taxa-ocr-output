during development in the barnacle Pollicipes polymerus.
Activity of the enzyme was assessed for five developmental
stages and, for comparison, in the adult barnacle.
Materials and Methods
Obtaining Embryos
Adult Pollicipes were collected at Mussel Point near
Monterey, California in April and May, 1982. The embryos
are brooded in the mantle cavity in a pair of oval disks or
ovigerous lamelli. The embryos were inspected and classified
into one of the following five developmental stages: early
blastula, just after the anterior and posterior midgut
rudiment cells first become specified; limb rudiments,
development just begun of the naupliar limb rudiments; naupliar
appendages elongated; nonmotile nauplius; motile nauplius.
Assay of Enzyme Activity
The lamelli were gently homogenized on ice with a Dounce
homogenizer in a chilled buffer solution of 0.05M Tris, O.05M
Citrate, pH 4.0, unless otherwise specified. In the assays
for the determination of intracellular compartmentalization,
O.5M KCl was added to the buffer to insure an isotonic assay
medium. Determination of B-D-glucosidase activity, using
the synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenyl B-D-glucoside (Sigma
Chemical Co.) was modified after that of Fedecka-Bruner et al (4).
