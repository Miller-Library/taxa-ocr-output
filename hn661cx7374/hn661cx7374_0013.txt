Fig. 1. pH optimum of B-D-glucosidase activity in the
motile nauplius stage. Activity is expressed as 10 2 mole
substrate hydrolyzed/mg protein/60 minutes.
Fig. 2. Linearity of B-D-glucosidase activity as a function
of time. Activity is at ph 4.0 and is expressed as 10-2
mole substrate hydrolyzed/mg protein. Source of enzyme was
the motile nauplius stage.
Fig, 3. Linearity of rate as a function of protein concentration.
Results are expressed as change in optical density/60 minutes
of assay mixture. Source of enzyme was the motile nauplius
stage.
Fig, 4. B-D-glucosidase activity during developmental stages
of Pollicipes polymerus. For the motile nauplius, n-8; for all
other stages, n-3. Vertical lines indicate range, bars indicate
mean, and colored bars indicate standard deviation. Activity
is expressed as 10-9 moles substrate hydrolyzed/mg protein/60
minutes.
