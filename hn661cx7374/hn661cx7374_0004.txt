proportional to the protein concentration for up to 1800 ug
of added protein. For this reason, the protein concentration
was adjusted so that the final concentration was always less
than 1800 ug with most assays containing between 500 and 1000
ug protein.
Enzyme Activity in Development
Fig. 4 shows that the enzyme is present in the early
blastula stage of development and increased 18.7-fold through
the nauplius stage. Even though the embryos were classified
into five stages, there was very little variation except in
the motile nauplius stage. This stage exhibited 337 +103
nanomoles per mg protein per 60 minutes. For this reason.
five additional collections and assays of naupliar stages
were made to insure that the results were indicative of that
stage of development. The large deviation observed in the
naupliar stage can easily be explained by the fact that the
embryos are brooded for 30 days and as such, the stage
classified as the naupliar stage could represent a longer
time span than the other stages of development (6). This argument
is strengthened by the fact that, whereas the ovigerous
lamelli of the other stages have a characteristic texture and
color, the color of the motile nauplius stages were seen to
range from an orange-brown to a gray color. It was observed
that this progression of color was associated with an increase
in the accumulation of B-D-glucosidase activity.
