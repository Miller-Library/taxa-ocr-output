Summary
B-D-glucosidase activity increased during development
of the barnacle, Pollicipes polymerus. The activity increased
18.7-fold from early blastula through the nauplius stage and
at all stages exhibited a 3:l ratio of soluble to particulate
form and was activated by the detergent Triton X-100. A
similar activity was also found in the adult digestive tract.
The possible roles of the exhibited activity are discussed.

Introduction
Hydrolytic enzymes of Crustacea have been studied exten-
sively in the adult stages but almost nothing is known
about the embryonic synthesis of these proteins. Since the
midgut cells become specified around the 33 cell stage, it
seems probable that digestive enzymes might also be forming
simultaneously(1). An outgrowth of cells in the posterior
midgut of free-swimming larvae, or nauplii, of the barnacle
Balanus balanoides, were found to be very similar to those
of the adult digestive gland (2,3).
Lack of knowledge concerning specific enzymes, either
for the digestion of yolk proteins or for later use in the
adult barnacle, prompted this study of a B-D-glucosidase
