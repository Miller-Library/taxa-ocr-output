Discussion
The results of this study show the presence of a B-D-

glucosidase in Pollicipes embryos and nauplii. The activity,

h increased 18.7-fold from the early blastula through the
nauplius stage, exhibited a 3:l ratio of soluble to particulate
form in every stage. The enzyme was activated by the detergent
Triton X-100. A B-D-glucosidase activity was also present in
the adult digestive tract and this enzyme was activated
1.5-fold by Triton X-100 and similarly exhibited a 3:1
soluble:particulate nature. No further comparisons were made.
but these results suggest that the adult and embryonic forms
are isozymes. There are two major possibilities for the
presence of a B-D-glucosidase in embryonic stages. One
hypothesis is that the enzyme is used during embryogenesis,
as for digestion of yolk constituents. A second hypothesis
is that the enzyme activity is accumulating in the midgut cells
for later use in the swimming nauplius and following larval
stages.
If the first proposal is correct, the enzyme could be
functioning intracellularly, as in a lysosome, or extracellularly.
as a component of a developing but functioning embryonic gut.
A lysosomal role would seem to be excluded by the largely
soluble nature of the enzyme (the increased activity induced
by the detergent did not result from release of the enzyme
