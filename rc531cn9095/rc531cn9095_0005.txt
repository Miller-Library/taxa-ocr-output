sterias feeding, food items, and a subjective estimate of the percent
of the quadrat area usable as shelter by starfish. Observations were
also made of the conditions of Pt. Pinos and Mussel Pt. at high and
low tides on both calm days and days with large surf.
Mussel Point was sampled using . randomly placed ten meter long
transects, scoring one meter on either side of the line, resulting in
a twenty square meter sample area. Estimates of the percent shelter
were obtained using a .25 square meter quadrat, again placed randomly.
Owing to the small size of the area under the Cannery, it was
possible to sample the entire area at low tide.
In addition to the quadrat studies, many feeding observations were
made at Point Pinos over a five week period from mid-April to late May.
Records were kept of the number of starfish seen, number feeding, and
the number of each food item observed.
Escape Responses
For the chemoreception studies the 25 snails to be tested were
placed in each of two large glass bowls, filled with 100 ml. of fresh
sea water and allowed to settle for approximately one half-hour.
Eight milliliters of fresh sea water was then pipetted in, with both
bowls serving as their own controls. Responses of the snails were ob¬
served for twenty to thirty minutes. For the experimental runs, eight
milliliters of sea water was pipetted in from a bowl in which 8 to 10
Leptasterias had been held for one hour. (Average wet weight of indivi-
dual Leptasterias 3.5 grams) The behavior of the snails in each ex¬
perimental bowl was compared both to its own control run and the du¬
