General Introduction
The midtidal region of much of the rocky outer coast of central
California is a dense algal turf community dominated by Gigartina pap
illata and Rhodoglossum affine. This turf community has a complex
mesofaunal association of small worms, arthropods, and molluscs liv¬
ing within it which are coextensive with the standard array of more
familiar midtidal animals. A question of particular interest con¬
cerns the potential predators on the mesofauna, with one important can¬
didate being the predatory asteroid Leptasterias hexactis (Stimpson
1862). Much taxonomic confusion has resulted from the tremendous var¬
iability of Leptasterias, and what have been variously classified as
L. hexactis, L. aequalis, and L. pusilla are now included by Chia (1966)
in the single species, Leptasterias hexactis. In the Monterey Bay
area there are two distinct extremes of morphological forms, but the
gradations between these are innumerable, and for the purposes of this
study, all were considered to be L. hexactis.
Extensive feeding studies have been recorded for Leptasterias in
...
the Puget Sound region (Menge 1970). Leptasterias generally moves up
with the tide to forage, and if prey is captured that is too large to
consume during high tide, or too late to finish consumption before low
tide, the starfish will move down with the prey item to finish consump¬
tion over low tide. Little quantitative work has been done in the cen¬
tral California area, especially in this midtidal community, but some
incidental observations by Smith (1971) indicated some of the midtidal
