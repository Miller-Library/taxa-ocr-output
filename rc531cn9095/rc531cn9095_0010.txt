or at an acute angle away from the stimulus, with subsequent climbing.
No difference was seen in the response when contact with the tube foot
was made with other parts of the body, except that contact with the
posterior portion of the foot caused momentary retraction of that por-
tion and uninterrupted locomotion, as in Tricolia.
Mitrella tuberosa
M. tuberosa showed a highly variable, but moderate (see Fig. 3)
response at a distance, consisting of a brief burst (about 5 min.) of
locomotory activity with no consistent direction shown. No climbing
was observed. These are unusually active snails to begin with, and
a considerable number of control animals would show a response, how¬
ever the experimental response was significantly higher, as Fig. 4
shows.
Contact involved rapid retraction of the siphon or tentacles, rear¬
ing up on the posterior portion of the foot, change in direction, and
increased locomotion away from the stimulus. Contact with the clean
probe did not induce the siphon or tentacles to be withdrawn nearly
as quickly.
Littorina planaxis
L. planaxis showed no appreciable response by distance chemore¬
ception, as the number responding to the control was not significantly
different from the experimental situation. (Fig. 4)
Contact with a tube foot evoked a slow turn and slightly increased
locomotion away from the point of stimulus. The response was highly
variable in terms of speed of retreat and angle of turning.
