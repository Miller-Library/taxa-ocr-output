Barleeia haliotiphila
B. haliotiphila showed essentially no response by distance chemoÂ¬
reception, as Fig. 4 shows.
The response to contact involved a shallow turn away from the
stimulus and slightly increased rate of locomotion. The response was
variable both in occurrence and intensity, and was weak overall. No
climbing behavior was ever observed.
Bittium eschrichtii
This was the only snail to show virtually no response to either
contact or distance chemoreception, as Figure 4 clearly shows.
