This study shows that at Pt. Pinos a small gastropod identified
as Barleeia haliotiphila was the main prey species, followed by Tri-
colia pulloides. Smith (1971) noted that a small gastropod he iden-
tified as Diala (Barleeia) acuta was the main dietary item of Lepta-
sterias, but kept no quantitative records. Since I have worked in the
same area without encountering this species it is probable that he was
referring to B. haliotiphila.
Under the Cannery, the barnacle Balanus glandula was a major food
item, along with a juvenile pelecypod (Hiatella?), and the smaller bar-
nacle Chthamalus dalli. These differences in dietary items reflect
somewhat the differences in the sites themselves; a shaded, flat area
with slight algal growth and little surf versus a rocky zone with dense
algae and high wave exposure, inasmuch as the density of gastropods is
determined by the density of algae and local water conditions.
The extensive study done by Menge (1970) listed two barnacles,
Balanus glandula and B. cariosus as the main dietary items, followed
by some limpets; Acmaea (Notoacmaea) scutum and Acmaea (Colisella) pel¬
ta, and finally some smaller gastropods such as Lacuna sp., Littorina
scutulata, and Margarites sp. The only similar food species observed
in Monterey Bay were the barnacle B. glandula and the snail Margarites sp.
A considerable percentage of small gastropods comprise the rest of the
diet, both in Monterey and in Puget Sound, although the constituent spec¬
ies differ radically. It is interesting to note that the small gas¬
tropod Barleeia haliotiphila has no counterpart in the diet at Puget
Sound. This indicates Leptasterias is a species with plastic feeding
habits, which was to expected, given the varied dietary items catalogued
