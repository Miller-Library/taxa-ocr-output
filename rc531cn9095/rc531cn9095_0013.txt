rocks under the Cannery, and since algae is virtually missing, the turf-
feeding surfperches which are possible predators (Nichols 1979) are
unlikely to forage there. Casual observations on birds indicates reas¬
onable populations of shorebirds on the rocks at Pt. Pinos, and there
is no reason to assume fish are not resident in normal numbers.
There is also indicated strong selection for cryptic coloration
in the Pt, Pinos population. This species would be very labile in its
response to such selection since it broods eggs and the young recruit
to the local population. The facts that Leptasterias tolerates mild
exposure under the Cannery and that the species possesses the behav¬
ior of being able to follow the tide up and down makes it appear that
desiccation is unlikely to be a strong determinant in microhabitat oc¬
currence compared to the effects of predation.
Returning to the original question of the virtual absence of Lep¬
tasterias from Mussel Pt., we can apply the relationship of percent
cover to density plotted in Figure 1 for Pt. Pinos. Using this as a
model for prediction of a population density at Mussel Pt., where
available shelter averages twenty percent, we would predict a density
of two Leptasterias per .25 meter square. The observed density is two
per twenty square meters, and if we follow our above argument that des¬
iccation is not a strong force in population regulation, then predation
must be expected to be very high in this habitat. This could well be
the critical factor in explaining the very low density of Leptasterias
at Mussel Pt., where the densities of shorebirds (Braslow 1979) are
probably higher than any site in south Monterey Bay, as are those of
fish (Miller and Geibel 1973).
