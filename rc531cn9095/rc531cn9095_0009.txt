with the other aspects of the response. If possible, snails will
leave the water, and if not on an algal frond when this occurs, they
will eventually die of desiccation on the lip of the experimental bowl
or tub. Those on fronds will return to the water after a two to three
hour interval.
Contact evokes essentially the same behavior, except that the in-
itial direction of locomotion is directly away from the point of stimula¬
tion. Contact with the cephalic tentacles caused retraction of the
anterior portion of the body and reversal of the direction of locomo¬
tion. Contact with the side of the foot or epipodial tentacles caused
a violent throwing of the shell away from the stimulus, with uninter-
rupted fast locomotion and a turn at approximately a right angle away
from the point of stimulus. Contact with the rear of the foot caused
the foot to be withdrawn momentarily, with immediate resumption of
locomotion. The operculum was closed only when the snail was in¬
verted and the tube-foot place in continuous contact with the soft
parts.
Littorina scutulata
Response to chemoreception involved increased unidirectional lo¬
comotion and climbing, although not as strongly as Tricolia. Unlike
Tricolia, the response does not cease after leaving the water, result-
ing in large masses of ten to twenty snails precariously crawling on
the lip of the experimental bowl.
Contact evokes similar behavior, with upwards of 90% responding
(Fig. 4), except that the initial direction of locomotion is directly
