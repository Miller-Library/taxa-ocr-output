Leptasterias hexactis (Stimpson 1862) shows a patchy distribution a¬
long the rocky intertidal of south Monterey Bay. It was found that the
population density increased linearly with an increasing amount of avail¬
able shelter. Starfish are found either under rocks or algal thalli,
due mainly to a strong negative phototaxis. Possible major factors
behind this phototaxis are visual predation and desiccation, and ob¬
servations suggest that visual predation is primary. Lepasterias in
shaded conditions tolerates exposure at low tide where there are no a¬
vian predators. The population at Pt. Pinos exhibits a high level of
cryptic coloration which is proposed to result from visual predation.
In the Hopkins Marine Station preserve, where populations of potential
predators wer highest, the stars occur in very low density.
Food items of Leptasterias were examined at Pt. Pinos and under
the Cannery and were found to be radically different both from each
other and from previous work done in Puget Sound. In addition, escape
responses were described for six local gastropods in the presence of
Leptasterias. Tricolia pulloides showed the strongest response, with
Mitrella tuberosa and Littorina scutulata exhibiting moderate responses.
Barleeia haliotiphila and L. planaxis showed weak responses, and Bit-
tium eschrichtii showed virtually no response to either chemoreception
or contact with a starfish tube foot, even though Barleeia and Bittium
are important food items.
