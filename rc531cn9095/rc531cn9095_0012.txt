IV Discussion
Originally, the question of Leptasterias' habitat choice arose
when initial observations at Mussel Point indicated a very low densi¬
ty of Leptasterias relative to Pt. Pinos. Though the two areas seem
similar, closer study revealed major differences between them relating
to available cover.
The density of Leptasterias at Pt. Pinos increases linearly with
the amount of available shelter (rocks or large fronds of macroalgae).
Leptasterias shows a consistent negative phototaxis (Menge 1972) which,
when coupled with the tidal cycle of vertical movements accounts for
the preference for such shelter during daytime low tides. Major
reasons postulated for this response include avoidance of desiccation
and visual predation (Menge 1970) and both of these factors would be
at maximum levels during daytime low tides.
Some estimate of the relative importance of these two factors in
determining microhabitat occurrence may be made from comparison of the
populations at Pt. Pinos and under the Cannery for the following fac¬
tors:
% at Cannery
% at Pt. Pinos
Less than 17
1) Stars with damaged rays
20% damaged
80% cryptic
2) Color match to substrate
Low %
40% out
Less than 17
3) Exposed on rocks at low tide
Taken together, these indicate a lower level of predation at the
Cannery than at Pt. Pinos. Birds are not seen feeding or resting on
