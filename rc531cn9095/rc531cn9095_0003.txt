mesofauna as possible prey.
Some escape responses to Leptasterias have been described for
and
various larger gastropods; Notoacmaea scutum,AColisella limatula
(Phillips 1976), Colisella pelta (Margolin 1964), and Tegula funebralis
(Yarnall 1963), but little mention has been made of escape or avoid¬
ance behavior of some of the smaller gastropods occurring commonly in
the midtidal mesofauna of central California. This study was begun
in part to fill in the gaps in the local diet of Leptasterias, and to
examine some of the escape and avoidance responses of local mesofaun¬
al gastropods.
Although Leptasterias occurs widely from central California to
Puget Sound, there is considerable patchiness along the small section
of coast at the south end of Monterey Bay. Observations were made to
try and discern the physical or biotic factors that might be affect¬
ing this occurrence in microhabitat, and to try and compare their rel¬
ative importance.
Description of the study sites
Three sites were chosen, one for its obvious lack of Leptaster¬
ias, the others for their abundance.
Point Pinos Located at the south end of Monterey Bay, is exposed out-
er coast. Ocean swells and large waves contribute to very active wat¬
er conditions. The area consists of granitic reef with some large
boulders, making up twenty to thirty meters of exposed intertidal.
Abrupt variations in height from one to two meters are not uncommon.
The entire area is covered with thick algal growth. Major represent¬
