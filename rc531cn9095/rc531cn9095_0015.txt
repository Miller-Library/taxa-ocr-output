When escape or avoidance responses are observed in the lab, it
is important to keep in mind the natural context in which they occur.
Tricolia is usually found on algae such as Gigartina papillata, and
since Leptasterias is most likely to approach from below, the negative
geotactic response it exhibits to asteroid scent is highly adaptive.
One possible result of this action, desiccation, is apparently more
desirable than risking predation, although opportunities to leave the
water in the field may be limited depending on the state of the tide
and the location of the particular algal thallus.
Littorina scutulata also consistently leaves the water, favoring
desiccation (to which it is very well adapted) to possible consumption.
In the case of Mitrella tuberosa, the brief burst of locomotory ac¬
tivity is apparently enough to carry it away from a foraging Leptas¬
terias without exposing the snail to harmful environmental conditions.
Littorina planaxis, congener of L. scutulata, is usually out of the
water already and shows only a weak response to contact stimulation,
not surprising considering they are unlikely to encounter each other
in the field. Barleeia is usually found on similar algal types as
Tricolia, and its lack of any strong response, coupled with its high
abundance in the intertidal, probably contribute to its being the
main dietary item for the Pt. Pinos population. Bittium eschrichtii
remains an enigma, showing no escape or avoidance behavior, and it
is puzzling why it should be left evolutionarily bereft of such re¬
sponses.
