plicate run simultaneously. Two sets of control runs and two sets
of experimental runs were done for each species. For Tricolia pulloides
additional tests were run in a plastic tub in which Gigartina papil-
lata fronds were place such that the response on the algal thallus
could be observed. A similar protocol was followed, with fifty snails
on each plant, and each set of snails serving as its own control.
Some studies were done on the responses of the same species of
snails to contact with Leptasterias tube feet, using fifty individu¬
als of each species (40 for Bittium eschrichtii). The snail to be
tested was placed in a glass bowl filled with 75 milliliters of fresh
sea water, then allowed to come into contact with a clean probe. Be¬
havior was observed through a dissecting microscope. After five to
ten minutes, the same snail was allowed to make contact with a tube
foot held in fine forceps and subsequent behavior observed and com¬
pared with the control.

III Results
Results of a sampling program showed dramatic differences in the
density of Leptasterias in the rocky intertidal at the south end of
Monterey Bay. Sampling done at Mussel Point had on the average .1
starfish per square meter. A favorable habitat at Point Pinos showed
a density of 6-7 per square meter, while the area under the old Hov¬
den Cannery building had a density of 9-10 per square meter in an ap¬
proximately 25 square meter area.
It was observed that close to twenty percent of the animals found
at Pt. Pinos had lost from one to five arms, and were in the process
