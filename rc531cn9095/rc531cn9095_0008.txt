bralis, four percent, and two observations each of Notoacmaea insessa
and Margarites sp. One observation was made of a starfish consuming
Mopalia lignosa. Unidentified soft tissue made up eight percent of
the total.
Under the Cannery, the feeding differed widely from that at Pt.
Pinos. The primary food items were the barnacle Balanus glandula (367)
and a small unidentified juvenile nestling pelecypod, perhaps Hiatella
(367). Next was the smaller barnacle Chthamalus dalli (167). Under
the shade of the Cannery building, individuals were observed exposed
on rock surfaces feeding on both species of barnacles when the tide
was out.(40% of individuals). One observation of feeding on the snail
Mitrella tuberosa was made here, the only such observation during the
course of this study. Again, eight percent of the observations were
of unidentifiable soft tissue.
Escape Responses
Tricolia pulloides
This species showed the strongest response, both at a distance
and to contact (see Fig. 3) with over 90% of all experimental animals
responding (Fig. 4). Onset of the distance response was almost im¬
mediate for all snails responding, withethe response lasting approx-
imately twenty minutes. Distance response involved an increased lo¬
comotion rate, increased rate of beating of cephalic and epipodial
tentacles, and climbing. In both bowl and frond tests all of the re¬
sponding snails immediately ceased normal behavior of slow movement
with frequent turns and exhibited fast unidirectional movement, along
