Fig. 12. Discarding a shell after examining it.
When beginning to feed for the day, C, antennarius
examined and tested the first captured shells for five to
thirty minutes before it actually applied enough leverage
to chip off a portion of a shell. If the crab had already
been cracking shells and feeding on Pagurus immediately before
he began on another shell, the examination period was very
short and never lasted over ten minutes.
