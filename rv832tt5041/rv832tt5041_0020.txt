13. & 14, with Fig. 15.) The chela holding the shell always
remained in a low position during tilting while the crimping
chela moved into a near verticle position. The tougher the
shell the more the C. antennarius tilted its body and extended
its chelipeds. A tilt of 45 degrees was observed once inan
unsuccessful attempt at cracking a very hard shell containing
a Pagurus.
The average time it took the 44" C. antennarius to
extract a Pagurus from a Tegula shell from the time the
first chip was made was fifteen minutes (based on 12 timings).
The times ranged from 3 minutes to thirty minutes depending
pf the shell. (Fig. 16.)

are left in the tank, the C, antennarius crushes
all the large sections to fragments. Note how the
crab ehipped away at the body whorls leaving the
columella still intact. This shell was examined
by the 44" C, antennarius for six minutes and
broken down in eleven minutes.
