Summary
1. Under lab conditions hermit crabs were preyed
upon by Cancer antennarius, C, productus, C, gracilis, Pycnopodia
helianthoides, Pisaster orchraceous, and Octopus apollyon.
In the field fisaster orchraceous and Evasterias trochelii
were found preying on Pagurus.
2. Cancer antennarius in the lab was observed to have
a specific behavior for capturing and retaining Pagurus.
After which the shell was examined and later cracked by varied
techniques using both of the crab's pincers. Once the fagurus
was exposed from the cracked shell the maxillapeds helped
extract the hermit crab and push it toward the mouth.
3. Pisaster orchraceous and oftentimes Pycnopodia
helianthoides when unable to extract the Pagurus whole will
insert their stomach into the shell and digest the Pagurus.
4. Pagurus in lab tanks reacted to the mere presence
of a moving fycnopodia helianthoides and showed an escape
response to Pisaster ochraceous after capture.
