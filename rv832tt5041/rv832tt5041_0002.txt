Introduction
The hermit crabs, Pagurus sammuelis and P, granosimanus
are abudant on the rocky shore of California. To date no
special studies of predation on these crabs have been carried
out, although MacGinitie and MacGinitie (1949) note that
Octopus apollyon often feeds on them. Mackay (1942) found
that the primary food of Eancer magister to be Crustacea
under which he lists small crabs as important prey. Pagurids
are well protected by their hard exoskeletons and hard shell
salvaged from the ocean's bottom. In addition the hermit
crabs move about at a fair speed through the water and retract
far into their shells when disturbed. When wedged back into
their shells it is impossible to pull them out without either
damaging the animals or inducing them to release their hold.
Amarine animal which feeds on pagurids needs a special mechanism
and behavior to extirpate these highly protected animals.
The following studies were carried out in an effort to learn
more about predation on hermit crabs in thearea of the Hopkins
Marine Station at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California.
