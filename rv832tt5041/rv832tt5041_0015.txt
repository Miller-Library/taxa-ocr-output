Rackay (1943 described a claw raising behavior in
a tank-adapted Cancer magister at the approach of food.
He, however, attributed this behavior possibly to a conditioned
response resulting from feeding a crab eliciting a defensive
behavior. My observations support this hypothesis as I never
witnessed any such behavior in any of the Cancer spp. when
feeding undisturbed on hermit crabs.
