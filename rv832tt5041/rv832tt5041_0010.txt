facing the glass the Pagurus came out, grasped the arm of
P. ochraceous, and oscillated the shell back and forth until
the tube feet released their grip and the Pagurus could climb
free. (Fig. 3

Sek its shell fre
from the tube feet of the arm of P, ochraceous.
Once a shell was placed under one of the starfish's
arms it took at least two hours to transport the shell to
the mouth. In the only three complete observations of moving
the shells to the mouth, the shell en route to the center
was always flipped over so the aperture faced the starfish
before it finally reached the mouth. In all cases, P, ochraceous
fed by inserting its everted stomach into the shell of the
Pagurus
In the intertidal region field observations of two
P, ochraceous feeding on Pagurus granosimanus were made.
