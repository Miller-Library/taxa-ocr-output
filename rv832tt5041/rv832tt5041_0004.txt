of Pagurus were set up without predators to establish the
mortality rate in the absence of large predators. Details
are shown in Fig. 1. During the experiments, notes and photo-
graghs were made of the feeding mechanisms of the predators.
After termination of the feeding rate experiments the animals
were starved and used for detailed study of feeding behavior.
