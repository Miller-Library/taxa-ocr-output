Other Predators
Due to its secretive habits Octopus apollyon was
only observed feeding seven times in the lab. The octopus
grabbed a shell, examined the inside of the shell with the
distal portion of an arm, enclosed the shell completlely
with its body and arms, and extracted the Pagurus by some
unobserved means.
Evasterias troschelii was found feeding on a Pagurus
hemphillii in the subtidal region in about 20 feet of water.
No detailed study was made of the predatory behavior
of Cancer productus and C, gracilis. Through casual observation,
however, their behavior seemed to resemble that of C. antennarius.
