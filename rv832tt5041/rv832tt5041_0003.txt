Procedure
The hermit crabs used in these studies were large
specimens of Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1859) and P, gran-
osimanus (Stimpson, 1859) occupying shells of Tegula funebralis
and T. brunnea larger than 1.5 cm in diameter. Animals studied
as possible predators on species of Pagurus included the
following: Octopus apollyon (Berry, 1912); the crabs Cancer
productus (Randall, 1839), C. antennarius (Stimpson, 1856),
C. gracilis (Dana, 1852), Pachygrapsus crassipes (Randall,
1839), and Hemigrapsus nudus (Lana, 1857); the starfish
Pycnopodia helianthoides (Brandt, 1835), Patiria miniata
(Brandt, 1835), and Pisaster ochraceous (Erandt, 1835); the
sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835); and the
hermit crab Pagurus hemphillii (Benedict, 1892). All specimens
of hermit crabs and possible predators were collected in the
intertidal and adjacent subtidal regions near the Hopkins
Marine Station during April and May, 1965. For observations
of feeding rates the animals were kept in the laboratory in
17x11x10 inch tanks provided with running sea water at 1300.
Between 30 and 60 large Pagurus were placed in each of
several tanks and the numbers and weights of each species
were determined. Each tank was then provided with a particular
species of potential predators. Periodically counts were taken
of the numbers of Pagurus remaining and empty shells were
removed. As controls, tanks containing comparable groups
