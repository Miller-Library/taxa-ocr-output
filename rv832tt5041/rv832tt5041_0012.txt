sedentary periods Pagurus were found crawling over, under,
and around its body. Depending on thelocation of the prey,
C, antennarius was observed to use three different methods
to capture it. If a Pagurus touched the sensitive hairs on the
walking legs of C, antennarius, the legs touched were raised
and extended over the hermit crab then lowered and flexed to
draw the hermit crab below the crab's body. (Fig. 6.) In
capturing prey behind its body, C. antennarius extended its
last pair of walking legs, encircled the hermit crab posterierly,
and swept it forward under its body. C, antennarius was seen
to gather as many as eight hermit crabs under its body at one
time in;

A second means by which C. antennarius captures Pagurus
is by reaching out with a cheliped and clamping its pincers
