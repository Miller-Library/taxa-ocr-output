Qualatative Observations of Predation
Pycnopodia helianthoides
In the lab the only animal to which Pagurus showed a
marked escape response prior to capture was Pycnopodia helian
thoides. Pagurus moved quickly away from any P, helianthoides
which crawled along the bottom of the tank. Inthe eighteen times
I saw starfiches' arms encircle Pagurus' shells I never saw
one escape. Within 15-30 seconds the shell was transported to
the long tube feet near the oral opening always with the aperture
of the shell toward the mouth of the starfish. It usually
took between 10 minutes and 2 hours for P, helianthoides to
extract the Pagurus from its shell. If at the end of two or
three hours the starfish had not extracted the Pagurus it
either dropped the shell containing the live Pagurus, or inverted
its stomach and digested the Pagurus in the shell.
Pisaster ochraceous
Although capture by P, ochraceous was never observed,
Pagurus after captured showed several escape responses to
P, ochraceous. When Pagurus was placed under a starfish arm,
Pagurus usually retracted and remained still. After a few
minutes the hermit crab usually came out of its shell and
struggled actively. Typically it pushed against the glass of
the tank and raised the P, ochraceous' arm and then tried to
struggle free. Ifthe aperture of the Pagurus' shell was not
