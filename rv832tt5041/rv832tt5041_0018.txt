Cracking the Shell
With small or partially broken shells, C. antennarius
usually held the Pagurus' shell with one cheliped and crushed
it by using the other chela much like a nutcracker. The
shell was placed at the extreme proximal end between the
pincers, where the greatest leverage exists, and broken.

part of a Thais shell with its left pincer.
With larger shells, especially Tegula shells 2 cm. or more
in diameter, the crab commonly began by inserting the dactyls
of the two chelipeds into the aperture of the shell. While one
pincer held the shell the other crimped the outer lip until
a piece broke off from the whorl. (Fig. 14.) If the pincer
did not break off part of the whorl the walking legs many times
