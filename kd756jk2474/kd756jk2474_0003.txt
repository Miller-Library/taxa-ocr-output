Tube composition:
Percent magnesium in the tube material was determined by dissolving
washed, dried, and powdered samples in dilute HCl, and precipitating
out all alkaline earths except magnesium by the addition of ammonium
carbonate solution. The filtrate was then assayed for magnesium by the
method of Skoog and West (1965). Controls of known MgCo/CaCo were
also run to determine the accuracy level of the test.
Respiration:
Colony samples, each seventy-five ml and containing about 40 to 200
animals, from the intertidal and the wharf were maintained at 6° - 2',
0 f 1.5°, and 20?C - 3°C in finger, bowls of seawater. Colonies to be
kept at 20 were eae partitioned between two finger bowls to reduce
fouling; in the other temperatures each entire colony was kept together.
Additional animals were moved back and forth from 6% to 20' every day
except Sunday. The water was changed at least once a day except for on
two Sundays. For each temperature regime 120 intertidal worms were also
removed from their natural tubes and placed in closed end holes drilled
in plexiglass 1.27 cm deep and 0.23 cm in diameter, so that both their
heads and hind ends extended out the open ends as they do under natural field
conditions. Both number of deaths and the amount of skin pigment released
when animals were transferred to room temperature seawater were noted
after one and two weeks.
Respiratory rates were measured for each group either one or two
days after they were brought to the lab and placed in 12' running seawater,
and after both one and two weeks in the various temperature regimes. The
Warburg constant volume method was used to measure rates at 6.1', 12.0,
