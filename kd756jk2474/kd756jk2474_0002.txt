Diane Campbell, Temperature and habitat effects in Dodecaceria fewkesi. p. 3
spirabrancha acclimates to 7°0.
This study was undertaken to compare both physiologically, but with
emphasis on respiration, and morphologically, D. fewkesi from various
habitats. The following characteristics were looked at:
1. Morphology and size of the animals, the pattern of tube construction,
and mineral composition of the tubes.
2. Heat stress tolerance.
3. Respiratory rate / temperature curves and the 9 values for these.
4. Acclimation to experimental temperature regimes as measured by res¬
piratory rate.
MATERTALS and METHODS
General Descriptions:
Portions of Dodecaceria fewkesi colonies were removed with hammer
and chisel from three locations: Rocks between the O and 11.0 foot tide
levels at the east end of Agassiz beach at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS),
-10 feet on a piling below Wharf Two in Monterey, and at about -65 feet
on the reef-like area seaward from HMS. Wet body weight was determined
for groups of 5 animals each for 11 groups of intertidal worms, 14 groups
of wharf ones, and 4 groups of deep reef ones. Numbers of tentacles were
counted for 8 intertidal, 11 wharf, and 10 deep reef worms. Whether
the vast majority of tubes was vertical or irregular in direction was
noted for each colony. The maximun extension of newly growing tubes
above the level of the rest of the tube mass was measured as well. Sex
was determined by penetrating the integument with a dissecting needle
and watching for release of gametes under a dissecting scope.
