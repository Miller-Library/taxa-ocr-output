would allow water to remain in them when the tide goes out. Tubes from
the intertidal have shorter extensions than ones from the two subtidal
locations, perhaps because forceful wave action wears down this relatively
fragile structure. One similarity found between intertidal and deep reef
tubes was their lack or near lack of magnesium. This, however, could
certainly be controlled by different factors than the other character-
istics are. Lowenstam (1954) found that magnesium concentration correlates
with decreasing environmental temperature, with species with more than
85% aragonite (the mineral form with less than 1% magnesium) confined to
the tropics. This trend was not followed in some habitats, and D. fewl
appears to provide one of many exceptions to it.
SUMMARY
1. Tube morphology, tentacle number, and body size varies between animals
from various habitats. Magnesium content of the tubes is constant.
2. Over the range 6.1° to 19°0, the 90 for respiratory rates of D. fewkesi
increases with increasing temperature.
3. The intertidal animals tolerate heat stress better than deep reef
and wharf animals, as is indicated both by higher survival rates and
by lesser amounts of carotenoid skin pigment released.
4. No positive evidence for acclimation in either wharf or intertidal
animals to 6°,12°,20°C, or a variable temperature regime over a two
week period was obtained.
5. Respiratory rate / temperature curves for the larger subtidal animals
are fairly similar or slightly higher than that for intertidal ones.
