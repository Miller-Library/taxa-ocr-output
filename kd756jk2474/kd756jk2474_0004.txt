and 19.0°C - O.1°C. Animals were removed from their tubes with chisel
and hammer, dropped on filter paper for about 30 seconds until excess
moisture was gone before weighing, and placed in Warburg vessels containing
artificial seawater isotonic with local seawater. Gasior (1976) showed
that respiratory rates of D. fewkesi removed from their tubes and in
their natural tubes were no different. Four or five replicate vessels
were run for each experiment with five animals per vessel. Respiratory
rates were measured at 30 minute intervals for two hours at each temperature
with a two hour adjustment period in between. This adjustment period was
found to be sufficient for the animals to reach a new stable respiratory
rate. Each experimental run was started between 7:30 and 9:30 A.M. Res¬
piratory rates of one additional group of intertidal animals obtained
from the field 4 weeks later were determined at 6.1 12.0°, 19.0°, and 25.0°c.
The temperature was returned to 6.1°C over a period of 4 hours and the
rate was remeasured.
RESULTS
There is no positive evidence for temperature acclimation over a
two week period in animals from either the wharf or the intertidal. No
respiratory rate / temperature curve measured after two weeks for any
one group of animals is significantly different from the pre-acclimation
one for animals from the same habitat, with the exception that intertidal
animals maintained at 6°0 in their natural tubes for two weeks increased
their respiratory rates. This increase is significant according to the
Student t-test (p(0.05) when measured at 6.1° and 19.0°C. (Figure
