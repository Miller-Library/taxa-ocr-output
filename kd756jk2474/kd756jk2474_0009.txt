respiratory rates could all be due to 0, as well as temperature stress.
That no group of animals acclimated to a noticeable degree over a
two week period seems adaptive when their mode of life and habitat are
considered. D. fewkesi is a sedentary poychaete and spends its entire
life in one location's temperature regime. Temperature at the wharf lo-
cation probably changes little and slowly with the seasons, so that if
wharf animals acclimate to any noticeable extent they probably do so
over a longer period and only within a smaller temperature range. The
intertidal animals cope with as large of a temperature range daily as
they were subjected to in the lab. Hence it might be non-adaptive for
them to acclimate in their physiological processes by synthesizing new
isozymes so that reaction rates are substantially changed. The possibility
that they acclimated to a slight degree beyond the accuracy of the measur-
ment techniques used remains.
The 9., was found to increase with temperature in D. fewkesi, whereas
for basal metabolism in most animals it either decreases or remains
constant, Precht (1973). Noted along with this increase in 0 was
an increase in tentacle movement at higher temperature, so that these
rate / temperature curves are probably for active metabolism. This is
supported by Coyer and Magnum's (1973) work in which they found an in-
crease in 9,, with temperature for active metabolism but not basal me-
tabolism in Diopatra cuprea. They also found this uncommon phenomena
of increasing 90 with temperature in Amphitrite ornata, another poly-
chaete, for active and resting metabolism over small temperature ranges.
D. fewkesi's rate curve indicates it is very sensitive to temperature
changes in the range it normally lives in. The adaptive significance
