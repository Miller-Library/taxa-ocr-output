only near the top. Tube samples from both the intertidal and deep reef
contain less than 1% magnesium. Kauhanen (1976) has shown that these
animals do secrete their own tubes with an extension to artificial tubes
noticeable after about three weeks.
DISCUSSION
Intertidal Dodecaceria'ability to survive extreme heat stress seems
adaptive. Bolin and Abbott (1963) state that the average temperature
difference between surface waters and the -65 foot level is only about
two degrees during the spring. However, they indicate that the difference
in maximum temperatures is about four degrees; the difference in maximum
temperatures Dodecaceria from differing colonies is exposed to is pro¬
bably much greater, as the intertidal colony studied is exposed to am¬
bient air and sunlight at most low tides. Thus it makes adaptive sense that
intertidal animals can cope with heat stress better than the subtidal ones.
Wharf animals appeared to cope slightly better than deep reef ones at
extreme high temperatures, which is consistent with the expectation that
wharf ones are acclimatized to a temperature range a few degrees higher.
Temperature stress increases the release of a pigment which Dales
(1959) has shown to be a carotenoid stored in cells in the skin. This
suggests that heat alters the permeability properties of the cell mem-
branes in the skin. However, since the water in finger bowls with
colonies at 20° became foul and presumably concommitantly lower in 0,
tension, particularly for wharf animals, any changer in pigment, weight, and
