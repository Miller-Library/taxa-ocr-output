difference is significant for animals from all three habitats. (p «0.01) (Table 4)
The o for the one group of intertidal worms tested at 25° was 4.32 f 2.30
at 19.° to 25°, higher than 3.61 + 1.34 found at 12° to 19°, but not sig-
nificantly so. When these animals were returned to 6.1° from 25°, their
new respiratory rate was not significantly different from the rate obtained
at 6.1° for all intertidal groups.
The respiratory rate / temperature curves appear fairly similar for
animals from all three habitats, although the rates of subtidal animals
are slightly higher. Only data from animals freshly collected or main-
tained in running seawater at 120 was included in the calculations. The
difference is significant only when measured at 12°. (Student t-test.
p (0.01) The respiratory rates were corrected for weight relative to
each other according to the expression (w./w)-br., in which W - average
weight of animals from all three habitats. When corrected, the rates of
both subtidal populations were significantly higher than the rates of the
intertidal one at all three temperatures measured. (All p (0.01) The
wharf and deep reef rates were not significantly different at any temper-
ature. (Figure 3)
External as well as physiological differences for wharf and deep
reef versus intertidal animals were found. Wharf and deep reef animals
weigh considerably more than intertidal ones, have more tentacles, and
extend their individual tubes farther above the mass surface level of
the "worm rock". (Table 5) This agrees with results of a study by Kauhaner
(1976) in which larger sample sizes were used. Wharf and deep reef worms
also produce tubes protruding in many directions to form a cluster and
live throughout the calcareous rock, whereas intertidal ones secrete
tubes mostly in parallel with the openings pointing straight up and live
