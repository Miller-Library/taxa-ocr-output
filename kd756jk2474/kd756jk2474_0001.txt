INTRODUCTION
Dodecaceria fewkesi, a small cirratulid polychaete, inhabits envi-
ronments ranging from the mid-intertidal to subtidal depths of at least 90
feet. Berkeley and Berkeley (1954) have reported that it forms single-sex
colonies by asexual reproduction and lives in reef structures consisting
of masses of calcareous tubes. Colonies from various habitats differ in
the external structure of the tube masses and in the size of the animals.
Any given asexual colony must have been subjected to the same environmental
conditions for many decades. Because both the environmental conditions and
the morphology differ between habitats, it is likely that animals from
various habitats show physiological differences as well.
For a wide variety of organisms, subtidal animals have higher respi-
ratory rates over a wide range of temperatures than intertidal ones. Com-
parisons of rates between animals from various habitats have been made for
few polychaetes. Magnum (1972) has found that intertidal species of
onuphids have a higher 00 than intertidal ones. That study, however.
has compared different species, rather than subsets of the same, so that
differences due to habitat cannot be distinguished from habitat-independent
genotypic ones. Differences in respiratory rates between different popu-
lations of a single species can be attributed in part to short term and
long term acclimation to local temperature regimes. Studies on temperature
acclimation have been done for many animals, with different species showing
different patterns of response. Little work has been done on acclimation in
poychaetes. Magnum (1972) has shown that intertidal onuphids do not
acclimate, and Gladfeller (198) reports that the cirratulid, Cirriformia
