Diane Campbell, Temperature and habitat effects in Dodecaceria fewkesi. p. 7
When kept in an incubator at 34 to 35°C, 20% of the deep reef worms
died after two hours and 40 minutes, 20% of the wharf ones died after
six hours, and after eight hours no intertidal animals had succumbed.
At 37°0 20% of the deep reef worms died after two hours, and after about
five hours 60% of the deep reef worms, 53% of the wharf worms, and no
intertidal ones had died. No difference in death rates between animals
that had been kept at different acclimation temperatures was readily
apparent. Various temperatures produced many less severe effects in
the worms as well. At 6°C D. fewkesi did not extent its tentacles fully,
but no deaths occurred, at 12' it extended them fully and moved them
slowly, and when kept at 20° for several days nearly all the animals
moved out of their natural tubes and showed increased tentacle movement.
Nearly all wharf animals kept at 20 % died after 1.5 to 2 weeks. When
placed on filter paper for a few seconds and then put in seawater at room
temperature, healthy wharf, but not intertidal, animals released a greenish
yellow pigment through their skin which turned dark blue or black and
precipitated after a few hours. Wharf worms put in 12' seawater put out
no pigment. The temperature in which the animals were maintained influenced
the amount of pigment released when put in room temperature water after
two weeks. (Table 3)
The 00 values calculated for the temperature range 12° to 19' are
higher than those for the range 6.1 to 12° for animals from all three
habitats for which respiratory rates have been measured one or two days
after they were collected. This difference is significant at the p « 0.07
level according to the Student t-test for deep reef and intertidal
animals. If data from experimental runs for all groups of worms from a
given habitat, regardless of acclimation temperature, is pooled, this
