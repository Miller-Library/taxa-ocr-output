The larger subtidal animals tested showed similar although slightly
higher rates than the intertidal ones. Most species show the opposite trend,
a decreasing rate with increasing size, Prosser (1973). Therefore, either
the respiratory rate of D. fewkesi is not influenced by size, or the
subtidal animals have higher weight specific metabolic rates. When a
weight correction factor is introduced, the difference between subtidal
and intertidal animals is greatly amplified. The difference could be
due either to adaptation to different temperature regimes or to a genetic
difference between clones not necessarily correlated with habitat. Harrold
(1976) arguesthat in the marine gastropod, Crepidula adunca, the minimum
environmental temperature is of primary importance in setting respiratory
rates, while Heath (1963) states that some fish respond to the upper ex-
treme of the thermoperiod. Both the average maximum and the amount of
change in temperature differ between subtidal and intertidal locations,
so the animals could have adapted to different temperature regimes. It
is also possible that the larger number of tentacles present in subtidal
races may compensate partly for the usual decrease in respiratory rate
with size. Gladfeller (1968) suggests this as an explanation as to why
respiratory rates fall little with size in Cirriformia spirabrancha. Data
on additional clones is needed to differentiate among the explanations
given.
That physiological differences between animals from various habitats,
such as in respiratory rate, may exist is supported by other differences
seen between the clones from different environments. The multi-directional
arrangement of the subtidal colonies may be due to water circulating in all
directions in the subtidal locations. Vertical tubes in the intertidal
