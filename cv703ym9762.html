Beach and the Effect of Temperature on Jumping Äctivity

I. Introduction
Emphasis on physiological adaptation as an evolutionary strategy
has often overshadowed consideration of behavior as a means of adaptation.
Adaptation, in either sense, is concerned with an organism's ability
to exploit best a particular environmental niche. The marine collembolids,
commonly called springtails, have adapted to survive in a biologically
harsh environment and are one of the few macroscopic inhabitants of
sandy beaches in central California. Marine collembolids are limited
to this environment, and their delicate nature seems paradoxical in
this context; able to survive the severe environmental conditions of
sandy beaches, wind, temperature fluctuation, wave action, et cetera,
collembolids desiccate within minutes of being removed from a humid
environment. Even more difficult to explain is the behavior of jumping
which is characteristic of many collembolids found on central California
beaches. These collembolids have a jumping organ, the furculata, which
allows them to spring into the air. The adaptive significance of
jumping behavior is unclear. While Davenport (1903 ) suggests that
jumping aids respiration, there is no published work on this to date.
In the case of marine collembolids it is evident that the timing of such
hehavior must be closely regulated— jumping at inopportune times, such
as during high tide or midday, would be disasterous. No literature
deals with rhythmic patterns of collembolid jumping activity, but field
work conducted by Hopkins Marine Station students (spring, 1978) on a
beach near Mussel Point in Pacific Grove, California suggested the
presence of a temporal pattern of fluctuating jumping activity in the
collembolid <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Archiostoma besselli.</span> The following work was initiated to
investigate the rhythmic nature of jumping behavior in the population
Page 2
and to consider the effect of temperature on this behavior. The work
was divided into a preliminary field study followed by experimental
work in the laboratory.

A. Materials and Methods
A pocket beach near Mussel Point, California was chosen as a study
area for field investigation of collembolid jumping activity. A matrix
system of hollow metal rods driven into the sand was laid out for
reference in collecting animals (figure 1 ). Station numbers were
assigned to the rods indicating meters away from a reference post
located at the margin of the beach and the land vegetation.
Traps were set out at regular time intervals during five field
studies. The setting of traps proceeded as such: a three centimeter
square of graph paper divided into one-tenth centimeter units was
placed inside a 4.5 centimeter diameter jar lid (figure 2 ). One
large drop of Mobil 10W-40 oil was spread over the entire surface of
the lid, fully coating both the graph paper and the lid surface. The
lids were placed approximately two meters away from one another at
specific station sites for two minutes. To one side of the stations
samples were designated "A", to the other side they were designated "B",
When two lids were placed side by side for replicate samples they were
labeled Al and A2 or Bl and B2. After the two minute interval, the lids
were collected, brought into the laboratory, and surveyed under a dissecting
scope for collembolids sticking in the oil. The counting methodology
was such that all animals falling onto the graph paper and onto the white
surface of the lid were counted unless there were more than about 300
specimens in which case four random square centimeters on the graph paper
were counted and multiplied by pi (2.25)4 to estimate the total number
on the lid surface.

B. Results
The results from three of the five study periods appear in tablesl,
2 and 3. For the other two collection periods fewer than ten collembolids
were caught in any two minute collection period. One of these study ;
periods with negligible numbers took place on a windy morning (4:00 A.M.
to 1:00 P.M. ) with a morning low tide; the other occurred on a calm
foggy day with an afternoon low tide.
For the three other collection periods jumping activity as a function
of time for two representative stations has been graphed (Figures3, 4
and 5 ). For each station at a particular time samples from A and B were
totalled, or if Al and A2 or Bl and B2 were collected, they were averaged,
then summed. A tidal cycle is superimposed on the graphs (dashed line ).
The air temperature at station O at the collection time was recorded
and appear in the tables.
Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the distribution of collembolids along the
beach at the maximum activity period for each study period. During the
five study periods, collembolids ranged from as high as station 9 to
as low as station 26, with the greatest activity generally being found
near station 19 in the middle of the tidal range. For the April 27-28
study period the largest number of specimens was collected at station
19 at 7:45 A.M. (April 28 ) slightly preceeding a low tide. The
morning hours of this collection period were characterized by calm
ocean condition, norwind and warm temperatures (approximately 16
degrees centigrade at the time of maximum activity ). For the May 1-2
study period, the largest sample was collected at station 12 at 11:00
P.M. (May 9). This study period was a night of rough ocean conditions,
Page 5
no wind, and cool air temperatures (approximately 10 degrees centigrade
throughout the night ). For the May 9 study period the most animals
were collected at station 18 at 7:30 A.M., slightly following a low tide.
This collection period was characterized by calm ocean conditions, no
wind and cool air temperatures (approximately 10 degrees centigrade
at the time of maximum activity).
Several less formal collections were also undertaken with the
following results. During a week of high winds, animals were found to
occur in negligible (less than ten collected in a two minute interval)
numbers at all times sampled during the day and night. An afternoon of
light rain at a 4:00 P.M. low tide resulted in animals being active in
numbers similar to those found in early morning periods. Collembolids
were always found in negligible numbers on warm, sunny afternoons
(10:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.).

C. Discussion
Examination of tables 1, 2, and 3 and figures 3, 4 and5. reveals
the complex nature of collembolid activity in the field as a function
of time. In study period 1 (April 27-28 ) maximum activity for all
stations lower than station 16 occurs at 7:45 A.M., slightly preceeding
an 8:52 A.M. low tide. For stations15 and 16 maximum activity occurs
at the 4:20 A.M. collection soon after these stations were uncovered
by the ebbing tide. Five of the six stations sampled at 6:15 A.M. show
a decrease in activity from 5:35 A.M., thus the appearance of a bimodal
activity pattern for this particular study period. In study period 2
(May 1-2 ) a low tide occurs at 1:51 A.M. and maximum activity for
stations 11, 13, 14, and 15 occurs at the 3:40 A.M. collection, while
station 12 has maximum acivity at the onset of collecting ( 11:00 P.M.).
Station 10, though not sampled continuously throughout the night, shows
highest activity at 5:55 A.M., two hours after the other stations
sampled. This study period was unique in several respects. It followed
a week of storms, and the low tide fell up to station 16 because of the
high waves. The wave action from the storm had removed nearly one foot
of top sand from the beach, thus at station 15 there was a sudden dip
in the contour of the beach. By the time study period 3 (May 9 )
took place, the previously exposed coarse sand was again covered by fine
sand and the dip was gone. Figure 3 shows the most regular pattern
of jumping activity observed at any time, a dramatic example of the usual
pattern: all stations sampled (stations 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, and 22 )
peak suddenly at 7:30 A.M., slightly following a 7:00 A.M. low tide.
Previous to the huge 7:30 A.M. peak, stations 12, 14 and 18 have a
Page 7
slight peak (slight in comparison to the major peak, but still representing
hundreds of animals ) of activity at 3:30 A.M. or 4:30 A.M., again
suggesting some bimodality in activity.
Examination of temperatures for the study periods reveals that for
study periods 2 and 3 temperatures were in the same range, approximately
10 degrees centigrade during collections, however, the amount of activity
was not similar. Study period 1 and study period 3 both had maximum
activity near an early morning low tide, but temperatures were generally
higher for study period 1 (approximately 17 degree centigrade at
maximum activity ) and activity was much lower during this period as
compared to study period 3. This suggests that temperature might be
affecting the amount of activity. Low tides for periods 1 and 3 occur
nearly two hours apart, yet activity is maximum for both periods about
the same time, 7:30 A.M. This suggests that temperature, while possibly
affecting the amount of activity, does not affect its timing. Again,
examining data from study periods 1 and 3, the occurrence of some
activity before the 7:30 A.M. peak is more prominent in study period 1,
again being correlated with slightly higher temperatures in this period.
In both cases, with an early moning low tide a small peak of activity;
occurs on an outgoing tide and preceedsa peak of greater activity.
Other environmental conditions also seemd to effect jumping behavior.
Periods of winds resulted in very low activity (usually non-existent)
of collembolids at any time of day or night. Humidity seemed to have
an effect as well. On a rainy afternoon collembolids were observed to
be active in numbers which had only been found in early morning periods.
Foggy mornings seemed to bring collembolids out in the greatest numbers,
but quantitive data on this is lacking.
Page 8
The apparent positive effect that low temperatures have on jumping
activity in the collembolid population studied and the lack of temperature
effect on the timing of maximum jumping activity suggest the presence
of an endogenous cuing mechanism in collembolid jumping activity.
Work performed by Michelle McSpadden (1978 ) revealed the presence of
such a mechanism, and laboratory work was initiated to investigate the
effect of temperature on both the amount of activity and the timing of
activity.

III. Laboratory Work
A. Materials and Methods
Collembolids were collected between 5:00 A.M. and 8:00 A.M. on
May 24 near station 18. Plastic trays and coffee cans were sunk in the
sand with an inch or so of seawater in the bottoms. A virtual monolayer
of collembolids formed on the water surface, and the containers were
brought into the laboratory. Using a mouth aspirator, collembolids
were concentrated in a small jar from where they were spooned into six
Tuperware containers painted flat blåck to simulate constant dark conditions.
Infared diodes were positioned in the containers in a manner diagrammed
in figure 9. The light detecting diodes were wired to amplifying circuitry
(designed by Robin Burnett and built by me ) which then signalled a
channel on an EstralineAngus event recorder, thus, activity, as defined
by a partial interruption of the infared beam, was continuously recorded,
In analyzing the data, the marks on the Estraline Angus chart were
counted in hourly segments. Comparison of maximum activity for the
different containers was obtained by combining the counts from three
consecutive periods of highest activity.
The containers with the collembolids ran for 24 hours in ambient
laboratory conditions in order to establish relative numbers for latter
comparisons of containers. A Rustrak temperature recording device monitored
laboratory temperature. At 9:00 A.M. on May 25 the six containers were
removed from ambient laboratory conditions and were placed in four different
temperature regimes. Two containers were placed in a heated water bath,
one container was placed in an insulated container subject to laboratory
temperature (control ), two containers were placed in a 12.3 degree
centigrade formatemp bath and one container was placed in a styrafoam
Page 10
container with a frozen "blue ice" lid. The collembolids were allowed
to run in the different temperature regimes for 24 hours until 9:00 A.M.
on May 26 when they were returned to ambient laboratory conditions. Five
of the six containers were allowed to run for 48 hour under these conditions.
Collembolids in the blue ice container ran only 24 hours in the ambient
laboratory conditions and werereturned to a very cold temperature regime
(0 to 1 degree centigrade) after this period. They spent approximately
22 hours at these cold temperatures, then were allowed to slowly warm.
Page 11

B. Results and Discussion
The results of the laboratory experiments appear in figures 10, 11,
12, and 13. The temperature in or near each container at the times of
maximal activity appears at the top of the graphs. The darkened bar
represents fime spent in the particular tmperature regime. The findings
are summarized in table 4 and figure 14. A temperature response curve
for collembolid activity is shown in figure 15.
In all containers maximum activity during the first 24 hours occurs
between 5:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. on May 25. (This peak of maximum
activity will be referred to as the "A" peak.) Also in each case, a
smaller activity peak (designated peak "B") occurs approximately 11
hours previous to peak A. These results are consistent with work done
by McSpadden (1978 ) and support the conclusion that collembolid
activity is, in part, controlled by an endogenous temporal program.
McSpadden's work suggests that peak B might be a tidal component of a
circadian clock, the A peak being the principal element of a circadian
rhythm.
In the containers placed in the heated water bath activity decreases
to a very low level and does not reappear when the containers are returned
to ambient laboratory conditions on the third day. This suggests that
within this temperature range (28.8- 34.0 degrees centigrade) mortality
is high. Maximum activity in the control container (placed in an
insulated regime on the second day ) and in the container placed in the
formatemp was confined to the early morning "gate" throughout the course
of the experiment. This pattern of activity is consistent with MeSpadden's
Page 12
work. The A/B ratio in the control container increasesfrom 2.5 the first
day to 4.2 on the second day, possible the result of slightly warmer
temperature in the insulated container. On the third and fourth days
the ratio returns to approximately the value it was the first day.
The overall amount of activity in this container decreases as a function
of time, probably the result of mortality and escape.
In the two containers placed in the formatemp bath activity increases
on the second day by approximately 170% and 330% (peak A ). The
timing of the A peak does not seem to be affected, that is, maximum
activity still occurs in the early morning period. Also in this
temperature regime, the A/B ratio increases significantly from its
first day value, and a return of the containers to ambient condtions
results in an eventual return of this ratio to approximately its first
day value. The increase of the A/B ratio on the second day is due to
peak A increasing nearly 5 times as much as peak B.
The container placed in the blue ice box exhibited a 25% decrease
in activity in this regime as compared to activity during the first day
of ambient laboratory conditions. Once again, the timing of the A peak
does not appear to be affected in this cold regime (May 25 ). The
A/B ratio increases from 4.5 the first day to 12.8 the second day, with
A increasing more than B. The unusual occurrence of exaggerated
bimodality on the third day with a decrease in the A/B ratio to 1.3
could have several explanations. The cold conditions could have effected
the metabolism of the collembolids such that upon reaching the first
permissive point in their activity cycle, point B, they become more
active than before. Another possible explanation is that the return
to ambient conditions from a cold regime has affected the clock mechanism
Page 13
independent of a simple physiological response; the collembolid clock
might be causing the increased B peak activity rather than the animals'
metabólism. Further investigation is needed to explain this phenomenon,
Heckrotte's work ( 1960) with snake activity patterns suggests
an analogy that might be useful in understanding changes in peak ratios,
Heckrotte shows that a peak of activity occurs midday for low temperatures
(21.1 degrees centigrade ) and an activity peak occurs in early morning
for high temperature (35.5 degrees centigrade ), with shifting bimodal
peaks for intermediate temperatures. The conclusion he reaches is
that at each temperature activity is maximum at a time of day when
temperature would be expected to be optimum for activity. Whether or
not this sort of interpretation is applicable to collembolid activity
remains to be shown.
Another point of interest concerning the container kept in the
blue ice box deals with its teturn to very cold conditions on the third
day. The temperature in the box was maintained from 0 to 2 degrees
centigrade for approximately 22 hours, then allowed to slowly warm.
Activity peaked near 1:30 P.M. on the fourth day and did not show the
the same sort of decline that had been seen in the other containers.
This seems to suggest that the collembolid clock had been stopped by the
period of very cold temperatures and started again as the temperature
increased. There are some problems with this hypothesis in that the
container was kept in cold conditions for approximately 22 hours, yet
peak activity occurred approximately 7.5 hours later than would normally
be expected (i.e. 7.5 hours after 6:00 A.M. ). This could be explained
below a critical temperature
if the clock only terminated
in the 0 to 2 degree centigrade range. Because the cold regime fluctuated
between these temperatures, it is possible that only 7.5 hours was
Page 14
spent below the critical temperature. Further work is needed to investigate
this aspect of temperature effects.
The result that different temperature regimes effect the peak ratios
suggests a hypothesis concerning the effect of temperature on the
collembolid clock. If peak B is a tidal component of a circadian clock
then it could be less obligatory and more responsive to environmental
opportunities. The following algorithm might be at work: always be
active in the early morning hours and also be active at low tide if
condtitions (temperature, humidity, et cetera) are permissible. The
observation of animals being active at a 4:00 P.M. low tide on a rainy
day is supportive of this idea. When a low tide falls at early morning
and conditions are right, one would expect the greatest activity-
there is some suggestion of this from the field data that has been
presented.
The temperature reponse curve of collembolid activity (figure 15 )
displays a maximum at cool air temperatures (14.0 degrees centigrade
in this particular experiment ). This result is in agreement with
field data.thateshows greater activity at cooler air temperatures.
No field work was done at temperatures below 10 degrees centigrade,
but it would be interesting to see how cold temperatures could reach
in the field before activity is suspended.

IV. Summary
Data from the five field study periods, along with observations
from less formal field studies, though complex, suggest formation of
several generalizations:
1) Collembolid activity is generally greatest on calm, cool early
mornings, with maximum activity occurring from 6:00 A.M. to
8:00 A.M. during a morning low tide.
2)
Collembolids can also be actively jumping during the night, but
to a much less degree and do not necessarily peak in activity
at the low tide.
Collembolids do not actively jump on calm, sunny days ( 10:00 A.M.
3)
to 5:00 P.M.) everything else being constant.
4)
The greatest number of active collembolids on the study beach
was normally found near station 18, a position midway in the
tidal zone.
5) Collembolid activity is significantly affected by environmental
factors. Wind decreases the amount of activity and cool air
temperatures appear to increase the amount of activity.
6) Temperature does not seem to affect the timing of the period of
maximum activity, but warmer temperatures, while decreasing
maximum activity, appear to increase earlier activity.
The results of the laboratory experiments suggest the formation of
several generalizations concerning the effect of temperature on
collembolid jumping activity in the laboratory:
1)
Collembolids show an endogenous pattern of maximum activity
during the early morning hours peaking at approximately
6:00 A.M., and this activity is maximized in the laboratory
at air temperatures near 14 degrees centigrade.
Collembolids do not survive in the laboratory when sand
2)
temperatures exceed 29 degrees centigrade.
Very cold temperatures (O to 1 degree centigrade ) appear to
3)
stop the collembolid clock and shift activity from the early
morning gate.
The A/B ratio is temperature sensitive, increasing significantly
in response to a low temperature regime (11 to 14 degrees
centigrade ). A return to ambient laboratory temperatures
(21 to 26 degrees centigrade) from a cold regime (11 to 14
degrees centigrade ) results in a significant decrease in the
A/B ratio within two days.
Page 16
5) Different temperature regimes above 8 degrees centigrade affect
the total amount of collembolid activity and the amount of
activity at particular times (peaks A and B), but they do
not affect the timing of maximal activity (peak A).
