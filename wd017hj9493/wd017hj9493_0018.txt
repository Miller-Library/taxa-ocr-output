disappear. Several points argue against this scenario, however.
First, in comparing successful attacks between the youngest squid and the
intermediate-aged squid, the use of absolute scales would further accentuate the
differences in successful attack character evident in Figs. 6A and 6B due to the more
successful exploitation of a long distance strategy by the larger, intermediate-aged squid
Similarly, absolute comparisons of successes between intermediate-aged and the oldest
squid could be argued to lead to a convergence of attack distances in the histograms
presented in Figs. 6B and 60. However, the shapes of the histograms for these two
groups appear to be decidedly different, and a simple adjustment of the curves by a
constant factor to compensate for average growth would not render the two histograms
equivalent. Finally, unique specialized capture strategies observed to emerge in specific
age groups can account for improved performance at the appropriate distance and serve to
distinguish each age group from the others. The arm-intercept technique that allows squid
to capture copepods from greater distances first appeared in day 29 squid and coincided
with the increase in successful long distance attacks in the intermediate-aged squid.
Similarly, the oldest squid (day 41-42)--the only age group to display the low distance,
low speed tentacular grab strategy--exhibited more successful attacks at shorter distances
The observation of these characteristically unique attack strategies occurring in the two
age groups opposes the argument that attacks by the intermediate-aged and by the oldest
squid differ only relative to the attacking squid's mantle length.
Juvenile squid raised on copepods demonstrate a progressive development of
complex, acquired prey capture behaviors. Squid raised on Artemia nauplii and then
