grouped by distance (Group two squid). In Fig. 6A, successful captures in the youngest
squid (days 15-23) occurred from shorter distances, between 0.1 and 0.4 ML. Such
captures occurred when the squid attacked the copepod from a short distance, using an
adequate amount of thrust. During this earlier time period, the squid employed
predominantly the basic attack strategy described above.
As shown in Fig. 6B, day 26 to day 35 squid captured copepods more successfully
throughout a broader range of distances and speeds. While the captures in the lower
range can be attributed to the basic attack strategy observed in the younger squid, the
striking increase in captures from greater distances may be due to a newly developed
behavior. The appearance of these long range captures coincides with the appearance of a
specialized attack strategy to be discussed later, the "arm-intercept.'
In the oldest squid, days 41-42, successful captures were concentrated below 0.4
ML distance, although some still occurred at greater distances (Fig. 6C), and probably
involved arm-intercepts. The apparent improvement in short-distance attack performance
in these oldest squid may be attributed to the development of yet another strategy to be
discussed later, the "tentacular grab." The development of new strategies such as the arm-
intercept and the tentacular grab may allow the squid to explore greater ranges of attack
distances (and speed).
Figures 7A-C show complementary data for unsuccessful attempts by squid of each
age group. In each case, the attack distance distributions for unsuccessful attacks is
skewed towards long distances in comparison with data in Figs. 6A-C, but differences in
the three unsuccessful distributions also exist. The youngest squid in the study appear to
