squid displaying attack behavior were selectively tracked while filming until the squid
either successfully caught the prey item, stopped attacking, or moved out of the focal
range of the camcorder. Each filming session lasted approximately half an hour. Due to
the fluctuating availability of copepods, attacks on copepods were not filmed on every
day.
Frame-by-frame analysis of the data was undertaken using a Sony 9700 Hi 8
editing deck and a Sony Trinitron video monitor. Total attack distance and maximum
attack speed were measured using a caliper precise to .001 inch and normalized to the
mantle length of the attacking squid. Attack distance refers to the apparent straight-line
distance between the tip of the squids' arms and the copepod on the last frame just before
the squid's arms began to open up to initiate the actual attack. Maximum, or peak, attack
speed was measured on the monitor as the greatest distance travelled by the squid between
two consecutive frames during the attack lunge. Peak speed was usually attained within
four frames and represents the final approach of the squid, for after this burst of speed,
either the squid closed its arms upon the copepod in the culmination of a successful
attack, or the copepod escaped from the squid (an unsuccessful attack). Attacks in which
the squid was obviously moving vertically to a significant extent were not included in the
analysis. Direction of attack and copepod escape direction were also recorded when they
could be unambiguously determined by the orientation of the copepod antennae.
