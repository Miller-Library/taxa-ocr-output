Such a correlation roughly forms a 45 degree line as shown in Fig. 4. Points significantly
below this 45 degree line are indicative of a slow approach that would not be expected to
be successful unless coupled to a special strategy, such as the tentacular grab. The
paucity of points above this line implies that squid can accurately adjust attack speed to
match attack distance, and that they do not use more speed than is necessary. The fact
that a correlation exists in successful and unsuccessful attempts at all age groups studied
indicates that the ability to gauge distance and adjust attack speed accordingly either is
inborn or develops before day 15. Careful observation of the earliest feeding attempts by
squid on copepods would serve to distinguish these possibilities and to reveal the
ontogeny of the basic attack pattern. This work is presently in progress.
For the youngest squid in the study (days 15 to 23), the dominant strategy was the
basic attack. Although the successes only appeared to occur when the squid attacked from
short distances using sufficient speeds, many squid still attacked from above 1.0 ML, a
distance beyond which no successful captures were observed. The almost complete
disappearance by day 26 of attacks in this ineffective, long distance range takes on a
developmental significance as a means by which squid apparently improve their chances
of copepod capture. Such long, futile attacks were apparently selected against. Whether
the squid displaying these attacks died or modified their behaviors is not clear.
During days 26-35, squid expanded their effective attack range through the use of a
new, specialized attack strategy. The regular appearance of successful captures originating
from above 0.5 ML distance marks this development, and the appearance of the bimodal
distribution evident in Fig. 6B is consistent with the idea that squid in this age group
