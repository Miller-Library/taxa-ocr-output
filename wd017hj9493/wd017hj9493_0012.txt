Despite this, the physical attack sequence differed from that of the plankton reared squid,
however, and very few attacks were successful. When faced with copepods, Group three
squid did not appear to carefully position themselves before attacking or to engage in
normal circling behavior to achieve the head-on position. Comparison of Fig. 10 with
Fig. 7C indicates that the distribution of unsuccessful attack distances in Group three
squid is skewed towards long distances relative to those of the equivalent age group of
plankton-fed Group two squid. Moreover, Group three squid showed no attempts
whatsoever from the close (short distance) range below 0.4 ML, over which the day 42
Group two squid were highly successful. Instead, the 41-43 day old Artemia-raised squid
are more similar to the youngest group two squid studied (15-21 days) in that both
displayed a high percentage of long-distance failures (Fig. 10 vs. Fig. 7A).
V. Discussion:
In this discussion, two points shall be addressed: first, copepod capture is an
ability that must be acquired through experience; and second, squid acquire such an ability
through a progressive development of increasingly complex strategies.
Acquisition of Prey Capture Behavior-A Window of Opportunity:
Proof that experience is critical in the ontogeny of copepod capture is most evident
in a comparison of mortality counts between group two and group three squid. Before we
develop this point, let us first interpret the mortality data. As food type was the only
variable manipulated in the comparison between group two and group three squid,
significant differences in mortality between the two groups can be attributed to diet-
