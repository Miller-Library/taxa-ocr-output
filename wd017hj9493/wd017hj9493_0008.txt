another attempt to position itself in front of the copepod. This sequence of action and
reaction often repeated itself many times. Such movements would appear to be an
adaptive behavior by the squid, because the head-on positioning lends to the copepod
jumping partially towards the attacking squid in a fairly stereotyped escape response.
Although the exact direction taken by the copepod may be unpredictable, the possibilities
are basically limited to a solid angle in which the squid is waiting. This would greatly
increase the probability of interception, and circling behavior clearly plays an important
role in the more developed attack strategies discussed below.
In general, the basic attack strategy appeared most successful when the squid
lunged at the copepod from a modest distance with adequate speed. Attacks from
distances above one mantle length almost always failed, regardless of attack speed. As
shown in Fig. 4, essentially all of the filmed successful attacks (days 15-42) occur within
a range of less than 1.0 ML distance. Data in Fig. 4 also show that peak attack speed is
strongly correlated to total attack distance. Thus, very fast attacks are not launched from
short distances. Squid of each age group initiate successful captures over a wide range of
distances, but, as described below, some specialized strategies develop that facilitate
successful captures from both short and long distances.
As Figs. 5A-C show, the correlation between peak attack speed and attack distance
exists in both successful attacks and unsuccessful attempts at all times in this study. The
strength of the correlation appears to increase somewhat with age; however, a quantitative
analysis has not been carried out.
