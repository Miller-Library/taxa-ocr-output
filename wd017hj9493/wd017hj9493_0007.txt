The Basic Attack Sequence:
In the most general attack strategy observed (Fig. 2), the squid first fix their
attention upon and orient towards the potential copepod prey, pointing their arms in a
cone directly at the copepod. The squid actively maintains this posture through rhythmic
jetting and presumably fin control to remain in a fixed position relative to the prey. As
the actual attack commences, the squid opens its arms over a period ranging from one to
four video frames (33 msec/frame) and then swiftly jets forward at the prey item. An
attack ends successfully when the squid snaps its arms shut, having captured the prey, or,
unsuccessfully when the copepod responds to the attack with a quick escape response and
eludes the squid. This strategy, the first type of attack observed in the youngest squid,
appears to be the most general strategy. Squid utilized this strategy to attack not only
copepods, but also Artemia and other prey species.
Attacks on all species were attempted from all directions, but a preferred direction
of attacks on copepods appeared to be head-on, i.e. towards the anterior head region of the
copepod. This tendency was revealed by a variation in the basic attack that can be
described as "circling" behavior (Fig. 3), in which a squid pursuing a copepod would
move angularly, rotating around the copepod and apparently trying to attain the head-on
position. During this process, the copepod often would react to the squid's approach by
jumping forward at an angle, propelling it out of the squid's lane of approach. In
response, the squid would approach the copepod and repeat the rotation behavior in
