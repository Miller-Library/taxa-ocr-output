improvements in capture frequency and refinements in technique between younger and
older Group two squid.
Analysis of Group three squid attacks on copepods (days 41-43) reveals that these
squid resemble younger (day 15-23), Group two squid in their fast, long distance attacks.
While such long distance attacks were not observed in Group two squid after day 26, they
predominate in Group three squid at day 41. Long distance attack attempts probably
reflect either a lack of agility that prohibits a close approach of the copepod without
triggering its escape response, or the inability to properly time reactions to the erratic, fast
moving prey. Thus, these older, but inexperienced squid appear to be developmentally
stunted at a level more or less similar to that of Group two, day 15-23 squid exposed to
copepods shortly after hatching.
Exceptions do occur. Out of the 142 Group three squid alive on day 40 when
copepods were introduced, six had survived the crash 12 days later. Presumably these
squid possessed the ability to catch copepods. Despite the lack of exposure to copepods,
these six may have developed such an ability independently, by some mechanism other
than experience with copepod attacks, or they may have been extraordinarily flexible in
their ability to acquire the new skills necessary for copepod capture at day 40.
Progression of Strategies During the Period of Acquisition:
Having established that copepod capture is an acquired ability, we now move on to
examine the progressive development of this ability. First, the correlation between attack
distance and peak attack speed strongly suggests that a squid can accurately gauge the
distance between itself and the prey target, and then adjust its attack speed accordingly.
