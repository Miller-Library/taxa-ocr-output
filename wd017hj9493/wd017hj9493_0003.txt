nauplii, copepods, and larval fish, display three distinct sequential attack behaviors:
attention, positioning, and seizure. This paper builds upon this earlier work, through a
more in depth study of attacks on copepods, a major prey type which is the same as those
squid hatchlings encounter in the wild, and by focusing on the ontogeny of this complex
behavior.
Hanlon and Hixon (1983) characterized a wave of mortality during the first two
weeks post-hatching, due to squid that fail to properly initiate feeding behavior. This
work focuses on prey capture behavior after this initial period of mortality, by squid
which have presumably acquired the most basic skills to feed.
Development of copepod prey capture behavior was examined through the
simultaneous rearing of two experimental groups. Whereas copepods were fed to the one
group of squid shortly after birth, only slow, easily captured Artemia nauplii were fed to
the other group of squid from birth until day 40. On day 40, Artemia feeding ceased, and
these squid were thereafter fed copepods only. This experimental design allowed us not
only to observe the developing prey capture techniques in squid exposed to copepods from
birth, but also to compare the success and quality of copepod attacks between these squid
and the non-challenged, Artemia-fed squid. Study of the impaired attacks by Artemia-fed
squid provided additional insight into the nature of successful copepod captures.
Results from these two experiments suggest that first, copepod-capture is an
acquired ability developing through a progression of attack strategies, and second, a
window of opportunity exists early in life for squid to master copepod capture.
Results of this study may be relevant to foraging behavior in the field, and thereby
