Figure 8. The Arm-Intercept. First observed in day 29 squid, this strategy allows squid
to capture copepods from greater distances.
Figure 9. The Tentacular Grab. A low distance, low speed attack strategy, the tentacular
grab, observed in day 41-42 squid, may facilitate copepod captures at reduced
energy expenditures.
Figure 10. Attacks on Copepods, Group 3, Days 41-43. The presence of ineffectual, long
distance attacks in these Artemia-raised squid, and the similarity in attack distance
distribution between these and the younger, day 15-21 squid (Fig. 7A) may reflect
developmentally impaired prey capture abilities that resulted from a lack of
exposure to fast moving copepod prey early in life.
