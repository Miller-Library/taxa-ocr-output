after which the temperature was increased by approximately 0.6 °C. per day until 17-
18°C. was reached. Once the hatching commenced, the eggs were removed after several
days, and day one post-hatching was assigned to the day of most significant hatching
activity.
Feeding:
Squid hatchlings were fed once daily with either Artemia nauplii enriched with
algae and Super Selco (a nutrient medium rich in lipids, fatty acids, and vitamins;
produced by Artemia Systems N.V., Belgium), or with live marine plankton, obtained by
conventional surface tows in Monterey Bay, that consisted primarily of small, very quick,
Acartia sp. copepods, although larger Calanoid sp. copepods, chaetognaths, and an
assortment of crustacean larvae were also present in significant numbers.
Group two hatchlings (those in tank two) were fed marine plankton when available,
and Artemia nauplii when plankton was not available. Group three hatchlings were fed
only Artemia nauplii until day 40, when their diet was switched permanently to wild
plankton. Fig. 1 details the feeding regimen for each tank and presents daily mortality
counts. Two waves of mortality occur over days 1-12 and 25-35 in both groups, and this
is commonly seen in squid rearing operations (Hanlon & Hixon, 1983). The large
numbers of deaths in Group three starting on day 40 is discussed below.
Filming:
Feeding behavior was recorded with a Canon Al Digital Hi8 camcorder fitted with
a f 1 Vivatar close up lens and mounted on a tripod. The camcorder filmed at 30 frames
