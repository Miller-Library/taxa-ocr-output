attack from two distance ranges, the primary one below 1.0 ML and a secondary one
above 1.2 ML (Fig. 7A). Squid in the intermediate age group also display attacks in the
same range below 1.0 ML (Fig. 7B). Attacks from greater distances were not observed.
Older, day 42 squid (Fig. 7C) similarly show a similar distribution of attempts
predominantly below 1.0 ML.
Specialized Strategies:
Squid utilize characteristically different attacks at different ages. Speed
adjustments alone cannot account for the changing patterns of attack distance distribution;
rather, these changing patterns reflect the development of specific prey capture strategies
in squid. Here we present two such strategies.
In the intermediate-aged and in the oldest squid, two specific attack strategies were
observed: the arm-intercept and the tentacular grab. In the arm-intercept, (Fig. 8), the
squid first positions itself in front of the copepod, most often through the circling behavior
described above. Having postured itself head-on to the copepod, the squid then opens its
arms up very wide. Next, keeping its arms wide open, the squid jets at the copepod,
The strong jet of the squid triggers the copepod's escape response and the copepod
projects forward at some angle. Because the squid's arms are wide open, the copepod
may, during its escape attempt, run into the squid's arms to be captured
A distance/speed plot of attacks unambiguous arm-intercepts reveals that such
attacks usually occur from relatively large distances and speeds. (20.6 ML distance and -
0.3 ML/frame speed). Successful arm intercepts were first observed on day 29 and occur
in both the intermediate and the oldest squid groups, but their earliest developmental
