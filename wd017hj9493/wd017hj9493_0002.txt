I Abstract:
Juvenile squid, Loligo opalescens, face a great challenge in catching quick, elusive
copepods. The mastery of copepod capture, an acquired ability, develops progressively
past a basic attack strategy, through various strategies which facilitate capture, namely the
"arm-intercept" and the "tentacular grab." Squid raised exclusively on easily captured
Artem ia nauplii and introduced to a copepod diet 40 days after hatching could not master
copepod capture and died, presumably of starvation.
II. Introduction:
Juvenile squid are active predators with high metabolic rates sustained by
consuming as much as 35-80% of their body weight each day (Hurley, 1976). Little is
known about the life history of juvenile squid, such as where they are found or what they
eat-one can naturally speculate that they prey upon copepods, among other species, to
obtain their nourishment. In captivity, hatchling squid vigorously hunt and attack
copepods (Hurley, 1976), a major component of marine plankton, and it is likely that
copepods are a main food source in the wild as well.
Because copepods are small, erratically moving creatures with an extremely quick
escape response triggered by the motion of nearby predators (Yen & Fields, 1992), capture
of these organisms is a definite challenge for a newly hatched squid. Thus, we may ask,
what performance modifications occur in squid, as their motor capabilities develop after
birth, so that they may be more successful in copepod captures.
