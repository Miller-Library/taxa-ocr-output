switched to a copepod diet demonstrate a lack of such acquired abilities, as evidenced by
a severe mortality rate after the switch.
When considering the results of this study, one must keep in mind that copepods
are but one of many potential prey species in the wild. While this study may provide
insight into development in the field, the complete picture is surely much more complex
as juvenile squid most likely feed on a multitude of species and may have specific
strategies for each species. Just as Artemia fed squid appear handicapped in prey capture
ability when introduced to copepods, the relatively competent squid raised on copepods
may likewise be impaired if they were to be introduced to the wild. Such knowledge
would be important if, in the future, squid reared in tanks were released into the wild, for
tracking studies or for attempts at repopulation, for example. For mariculture, results of
this study reflect on the advisability of certain abrupt changes in feeding regimen,
Neurobiologist may be able to capitalize on behaviorally impaired organisms, such as the
Group three squid, to search for neurological signs of the behavioral deficit in these
organisms. Finally, the notion of experience-based modules of behavioral development
may be a factor to consider in designing neurobiological experiments.

Aquarium for their assistance and the use of their facilities in rearing the squid, and for
their valuable input into this study.
