employed more than one strategy. The basic attack strategy most likely accounts for the
captures at distances less than 0.4 ML, whereas the more recently acquired arm-intercept
at least partially accounts for the improved performance in the longer distance range.
Arm intercepts, which were still practiced by day 41-42 squid, largely account for
the existence of captures at greater distances in the oldest squid studied, but in this group,
successful attacks were most prominent in a region of very short distances and low
speeds. Coinciding with this shift in attack parameters is the first appearance of
successful tentacular grabs (day 41), which may serve to allow squid to capture copepods
with less effort, shooting their tentacles out rather than propelling their whole bodies,
This pattern is very similar to that employed by adult squid (Kier, 1982). It is noteworthy
that in the tentacular-based short distance attacks observed in day 41-42 squid, these
animals achieve significantly slower peak attack speeds than do younger squid. It is likely
that such slow attacks require far less energy expenditure than high speed alternatives, but
the extent of savings in relation to the total metabolic requirements of the growing squid
remains to be determined.
Because of significant growth of animals during the course this study,
measurements of attack distance and speed relative to mantle length are obviously
dependent on the size of the attacking squid. As a significant size variation exists within
age groups, and because neither individual nor mean lengths were determined for animals
in either group, the effects of mantle size on the analyses presented here cannot be
rigorously assessed. One might argue that if attack distances and speeds were plotted on
absolute scales, the apparent shifts in the character of attacks between age groups would
