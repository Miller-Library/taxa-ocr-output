be important to fisheries biology. In addition, findings from this study will serve to guide
approaches to squid mariculture in the optimal design of feeding regimens. Finally, the
characterization of specific behaviors revealed at certain ages in this study may provide a
valuable model system for developmental neurobiology studies in relation to experience¬
dependent modification of behavior.

Culture:
Five egg cases of the California market squid, species Loligo opalescens were held
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in each of two identical 320 liter tanks. Each of the tanks,
labelled tank two and tank three, represented an experimental group, hereafter referred to
as group two and group three, respectively. These black cylindrical tanks possess gently
sloping conical bottoms and measure one meter in diameter at the top. Tanks were
exposed to natural daylight that entered the room, and overhead fluorescent lights
illuminated the tanks between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily. Except for periods of maintenance
and feeding, the tanks were kept partially covered with a black plastic sheet. Each
morning, all dead squid were siphoned out of the tank, and the daily mortality count was
tabulated. Detritus was also siphoned off the bottom and organic debris skimmed from
the surface at this time.
Flow-through water was provided to the tanks from a temperature-controlled
reservoir (-300 liters volume) fed with natural seawater passed through a 10 micron filter,
and water recirculated into the tanks. Egg cases were held at 14-15°C. until hatching,
