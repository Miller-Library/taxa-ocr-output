with an extended period of time where copepods were the predominant, if not exclusive
prey item available in the tank, these squid may have perished from malnourishment.
This explanation would be consistent with the interpretation, to be discussed below, of the
extremely high mortality experienced by Group three squid after the introduction of a
copepod diet. After day 39, Group two squid exhibited minimal deaths until day 53 when
the study was terminated.
An indication of the importance of experience in mastering prey capture is evident
in the mortality data for Group three squid. The dramatic increase in mortality rates that
occurred after the switch to a copepod food source can be attributed to an inability to
catch copepods rather than to lack of prey recognition, as evidenced by the many failed
attempts (Fig. 10). Total mortality during this period vastly exceeded not only that of
Group two during the same time period (days 41-52), but also that suffered by either
Group two or three squid during their initial introduction to prey directly after hatching.
These comparisons suggest that after 40 days, the squid's ability to master copepod
capture is greatly impaired.
We hypothesize that squid deprived of exposure to their natural food source of
copepods for several weeks after birth fail to receive the developmental cues and
experience necessary for the ontogeny of copepod capture. Copepod capture is an ability
that must be experientially acquired within the first forty days, more likely earlier than
later. The low rate of survival after switching foods refutes the idea that copepod capture
may be simply an innate ability or a developmentally programmed skill. An additional
strong indication that copepod capture is an acquired ability can be found in the
