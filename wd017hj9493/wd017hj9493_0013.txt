dependent factors. All other factors, environmental and handling factors included, were
identical in the two groups. Invariably, "noise" in the mortality records emerges during
such an experiment that makes detailed comparisons between groups difficult, and
replicate experiments can help separate "signal" from noise. Results of the prey-item
switch described in this report were confirmed in a previous experiment carried out one
year earlier.
Before squid can acquire specific strategies for copepod attacks, they must possess
the basic ability to attack and feed during the first 1-2 weeks of life. The initial wave of
mortality between day one and day 13 in both Groups two and three most likely is due to
squid that perished from starvation because they did not make the transition from internal
yolk nourishment to feeding by developing successful prey capture (Hanlon & Hixon,
1983). Thus, those squid that survived the first mortality wave must possess the
fundamental attack skills described in this paper as the "basic attack." We are presently
studying this two-week period in order to reveal the progression of development of this
behavior necessary for survival.
After the initial wave of mortalities, the subsequent period of low mortality in both
tanks indicates that nearly all the squid were capturing and feeding upon prey. Between
days 26 and 39, Group two squid experienced another wave of mortalities, possibly due to
a change in the feeding regimen. Because of increased copepod availability starting on
day 20, these squid were fed copepods exclusively for 11 days. It is possible that certain
Group two squid had not developed the ability to catch the fast copepods and had been
surviving on the regular provisions of Artemia nauplii during the first 20 days. Faced
