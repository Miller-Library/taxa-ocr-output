appearance is not precisely known.
In the tentacular grab (Fig. 9), the squid must first smoothly maneuver itself quite
close to the copepod (so as not to trigger the copepodâ€™s escape response). When it is in
position, the squid rapidly extends it long feeding tentacles (appendages longer than the
arms) within one to two video frames (33 msec/frame), grabs the prey, retracts the
tentacles, and then wrestles the copepod into submission with its arms. During this
procedure, most of the movement occurs in the tentacles--the body moves only slightly.
Most tentacular grabs occur within 0.4 ML distance and below 0.2 ML/frame speed.
Tentacular grab attempts were first observed in intermediate-aged squid, but successful
captures using this strategy were not observed until days 41 and 42.
Copepod Capture by Artemia-raised Squid:
Results described thus far were obtained on squid that had been exposed to
copepods as the predominant food source from birth, and mortality in this group was
extremely low from day 40 until the end of the study (day 53) as indicated in Fig. 1. On
the other hand, Group three squid were reared from birth on only enriched Artem ia nauplii
and subjected to a complete switch to copepod prey items on day 40. Coinciding with
this switch to plankton, the death count accelerated to more than 30 mortalities per day.
Of the 142 squid present on day 40, only six survived to day 53.
During the period of copepod exposure, the Group three squid clearly recognized
the copepods as potential prey items and made large numbers of attacks. These attacks
were studied on days 41-43 and found to be launched almost exclusively from distances
greater than 0.5 ML (Fig. 10) at speeds appropriate for this range (data not illus.).
