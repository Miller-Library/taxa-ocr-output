ITRODUCTION
The small gastropod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Littorina scutulata : Exact'>Littorina scutulata</span> (Gould 1949),
is a conspicuous inhabitant of the upper intertidal zone
of the West Coast of the United States. Minimal research
has been done on its short-term behavior patterns. The
only significant works address differential rates of
migration in animals of different sizes (Chow, 1975), and
migration up or down with the tidal cycle (Glynn, 1965).
Preliminary observations of Littorina scutulata in
the field at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California
suggested further study of migration patterns would be
desirable. A tendency to move up and out of the high
tide pools around dusk, and a tendency to move downward
with approaching dawn, were noted. The questions arose,
does the <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>L. scutulata</span> population undergo a diurnal
migration, and if so how consistent is it, and with what
environmental changes are movements correlated? The
purpose of this study was to provide data answering these
questions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A study site was chosen near the western tip of
Mussel Point, on the grounds of Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, California. The two pools studied were
located in a region exposed to strong wave action, but
high enough in the intertidal zone (three to four feet
above the Balanus-Endocladia belt: see Glynn, 1965) so
that high tides and rough surf were necessary for sig-
nificant water exchange. A large granite plateau, sloping
from the sea, provided a permanent basin for the two pools.
Pool #1, the larger pool, was situated furthest from the
sea, having the gradually sloping plateau as a bottom.
The
much smaller Pool #2, positioned very near the seaward
edge of the granite plateau, occupied a small depression
on the sloping granite surface (see fig. 1). Pool f2 was
more frequently disturbed by wave action, and appeared to
be a less extreme environment than Pool fl, which was
situated at the highest level occupied by L. scutulata.
A square wooden quadrat frame (lmx 1m) subdivided into
100 10 x 10cm squares with nylon line was placed about one
inch above Pool l in an open area with a gradual slope
(see fig. 1). This Quadrat (#1) was positioned so the
border line between the third and fourth rows of squares
corresponded roughly to the normal water level. An observer
could look down over the grid and count the number of snails
within each square. Snail counts were made at various times
and under various conditions during 24 hour diel cycles and
25 hour tidal cycles, paying particular attention to periods
of significant environmental change (eg. dawn, dusk, higher
high tide, etc.). A contour map of the quadrat l area was
made by measuring depths within each 10 x 10cm square with
a ruler (fig. 2), and an average depth for each square
calculated (fig. 3).
For the smaller pool (Pool #2), the rough terrain
prevented the use of a simple quadrat frame. In early
experimentation counts were made only of animals in and
out of water, and in crevices. For later studies a trans¬
parent plexiglass overlay was cut to fit the pool and
surrounding edges, and divided into 4cm x Acm squares.
By looking down upon this quadrat (42) snail counts within
each square could be made. A contour map was also made for
Pool #2 (see fig. 4), and an average depth for each square
calculated (see fig. 5).
Various environmental parameters were monitored during
one or more of the experiments. Initially the Winkler
titration method (Carrit and Carpenter, 1966) was used to
determine dissolved oxygen concentrations within the tide
pools. This method proved unsatisfactory for extended
field study and therefore a portable oxygen meter and
electrode were later employed (Yellow Springs Instrument
Co. model #54). A LI-COR photometer (model LI-185) was
used to measure light intensities throughout the diurnal
cycle. The salinity of the tide pools was measured using
an American Optical Co. refractometer. Temperatures were
recorded by a Weather Measure mercury thermometer.
I. DIEL MOVEMENTS
To study L. scutulata's migration during the diel
cycle, one observation was carried out on Pool fl; the
results are shown in figure 6. Three additional experiments
were carried out on Pool #2. The results for these
experiments (f2-4) are presented in figures 7-9.
Figure +6 shows that L. scutulata was engaging in a
migration correlating with the diel cycle. In the transition
from afternoon to darkness (5:30 PM-8:00 PM) a noticeable
upward migration of L. scutulata occurred. Note the decrease
in population in the 4-7cm depth range and the corresponding
increase in animals in the 0-3cm depth range. A reciprocal
migration downward in the transition from darkness to dawn
is not clear from these data. Pool l was situated in
L. scutulata's uppermost intertidal range, and for this
reason atypical behavior of its inhabitants was suspected.
Pool f2 was used in all further experiments.
The results of experiment #2 (see fig. #7) show a
definite shift in population upward and out of the pool
during the transition from day to night. This migration
correlates reasonably well with the temperature curve.
the temperature decreasing abruptly with the onset of dark-
ness as the snails move upward. The increase in temperature
at dawn is considerably more gradual, and the correlation
with the snail's downward migration less distinct. The high
tides at this date occurred near dawn and dusk. Does the
tidal cycle itself influence L. scutulata's migration? If
it does, a bimodal curve might be expected, with upwardmove-
ment accompanying the two high tides and downward movement
accompanying the two low tides as reported by Glynn (1965).
However, the migration data show no downward migration at
the high low tide at 12:45 AM, and a downward migration at
the low high tide 6:30 AM, while there was an upward move-
ment at the high-high tide the preceding evening.
Experiment #3 results were gathered using a plexiglass
overlay. The population (see fig. 8) migrated downward
with approaching dawn, as is evident in the population
changes at the 1-2cm depth range and the 3-Acm depth range;
the snails were already in their normal position by 5:00 PM
the previous evening. Snail movements show some correlation
with changes in temperature and oxygen concentration. However,
the observations were preceded by rough seas, high tides,
and considerable flooding of Pool #2. Wave splash into
Pool #2 also occurred during the period 8:00 PM tol midnight
of the first day, which may have inhibited normal migratory
behavior.
Experiment 4 was similar to #3 except that very little
flooding of Pool +2 preceded the observations and no splash
occurred during the experiment itself. The population (see
fig. 9) shows a very obvious migration upward at dusk and
downward at dawn. Note particularly the progressive con-
centration of the snail population in the 0-2cm depth range
at nightfall, and the significant shift downward in the early
morning hours. This migration, once again, parallels
fluctuations in light intensity, oxygen concentration, and
tidal levels.
The foregoing observations show that numerous pool-
dwelling L. scutulata migrate upward in the evening and
downward at dawn, a movement correlated well with the light
regime as well as other physical parameters that vary
accordingly. Any correlation between tidal cycle (semi¬
diurnal) and the snail's migration pattern (diurnal) seems
to be coincidental.
II. RESPONSE TO TURBULENCE
To separate the effects of turbulence and water ex-
change from those of other factors that might influence the
diel cycle of movement in L. scutulata, an experiment was
performed. At a high tide period on May 19, 1:30 PM, arti-
ficial turbulence was induced by flooding Pool #2 with
approximately one quart of fresh seawater every 30 seconds.
dumped in from the seaward side. In this attempt to simulate
natural water exchange, the distribution of the snail pop-
ulation was recorded every half hour for three hours. The
results for this experiment (45) are shown in figures 10 and
11.
The snails show a marked migration from the O-2cm depth
range to the greatest depths of Pool #2, which correlates
well with the continual artificial turbulence. The major
pathways of migration are schematically represented in figure
11. Note the population is concentrated at very shallow
depths at 1:30 PM and shifts to the greatest depths by 4:00 PM.
This migration is particularly significant since no major
migration of L. scutulata was ever seen in the early afternoon
under normal conditions.
Other changing environmental parameters correlated with
snail movements here might possibly influence snail behavior,
Salinity decreases from 45%0 to 35 %0, and there is a
similar drop in temperature (160 to 11°0.). Oxygen con¬
centration decreased from 15.9 ppm to 11.2 ppm. These
parameters may be important especially when considering
that most snails are normally submerged at 1:30 PM in the
afternoon.
The migration of L. scutulata into the more protected
region of the pool with increased turbulence and related
effects in experiment #5 may be of selective advantage.
It would help the snails avoid displacement by wave action
to an environment not suited for L. scutulata.
SUMMARY
1. Studies of diel cycles of migration and of responses
to turbulence were made on the marine snail Littorina
scutulata at Pacific Grove, California.
2.
Snail populations in pools undergo an upward migration
correlating well with approaching darkness and a
reciprocal downward migration correlating with dawn.
Some other physical parameters fluctuate with the
light cycle (e.g. oxygen concentration, temperature,
etc.) and these might also influence the migration.
4. A migration of snails to the depths of a tide pool
subjected experimentally to turbulence was noted.
This response may be of adaptive advantage in avoiding
displacement in unfavorable situations.
