of cells to FMRF-amide presynaptic to RP3, depending on
which of the two posssible FMRF-amide receptors these
cells had.
An interesting point to notice is the unique effect
that the combination of 5-HT and FMRF-amide had on the
burster LP1. Applied by themselves, neither induced any
synaptic input onto LP1. But together, synaptic input that
had not been seen previously , ocurred. What possible
mechanism could account for this? Because FMRF-amide
and 5-HT both induce depolarizing responses in LP1, they
may possibly be acting via the same mechanism, such as
the opening of the same inward cation channels.
FMRF-amide and 5-HT may not be able to produce a
depolarization by themselves in cells presynaptic to LPI
that is sufficient to exceed the threshold of these cells,
resulting in no transmitter release and therefore no
synaptic input. But both FMRF-amide and 5-HT applied
together may have the dual effect of depolarizing the
presynaptic cells more than either is capable of doing
alone, resultingly exceeding threshold and producing the
synaptic input seen.
5-HT, like FMRF-amide, also produced various
responses in D. albopunctata. The burster LP1, and the
beaters LP2 and RP3 exhibited a depolarizing response
that is possibly explained by Levitan and Levitan's (1988)
