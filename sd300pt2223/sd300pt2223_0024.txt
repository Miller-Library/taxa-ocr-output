converted into a high rate of repetetive
firing.
Fig.4. A. 5-HT has a delayed response on RP2, eventually
inhibiting its beating pattern.
B. 5-HT excites LP2, increasing its rate of firing.
Fig.5. 5-HT induces a higher rate of repetetive firing
in RP3, The response attenuates with repeated
applications. Arrows represent spike interval
measurements 60s after 5-HT application in trials
1,2, and 3.

high rate of repetetive firing.
B. DA inhibits firing in LP2.
Fig.8. 5-HT causes an increase in inward rectification
in LPI.
