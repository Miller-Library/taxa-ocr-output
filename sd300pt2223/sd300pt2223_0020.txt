observation of an increase in input resistance following
application. This corresponds well with Coombs and
Thompson's (1987) finding that forskolin acts on certain
D. albopunctata neurons to close transient K+-channels.
Closure of K+-channels would depolarize the cell, and
could resultingly contribute to the creation of a new
resting potential that exceeds the thresholds of the
multiple spike initiating zones located at various points
along the axon; or possibly the single spike initiating
zones on multiple axons extending from the soma. If this
depolarization effect were to occur, trains of spikes
would result that were in fact observed upon application
of forskolin. The decrease in inward rectification seen
under voltage clamp could add to the decreased K+
conductance, assuming that this current was carried
mostly by K+ ions. This in turn, would act to depolarize
LP1 still further, thus providing even more feasibility
for the multiple spikes.
The decrease in the transient K+- current that Coombs
and Thompson (1987) described could also provide a
mechanism by which a number of other effects of
forskolin acted. Because  is active at subthreshold
voltages, it exerts its main effects not on changing spike
shape, but on slowing the rate of repetetive firing and
controlling spike interval. Therefore, it is reasonable to
