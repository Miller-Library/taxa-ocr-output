MATERIALS AND METHODS
Doriopsilla albopunctata were collected subtidally
from Montery Bay, CA., and stored in flowing natural sea
water tanks of approximately 13°C. They were not fed.
Ganglia were surgically removed and treated with
dispase, a neutral protease, for one hour followed by a
minimum of a two hour rinse in ASW to facilitate
removal of the epineural sheath.
Experiments were performed on the pleural ganglia
pinned in a Sylgard dish of approximately 5ml bath
volume and perfused with ASW of the following
composition: 470mM Nacl, 10mM KCI, 10mM Cacl, 50mM
MgCl, and 10mM Hepes (pH 7.8). Bath temperature during
experiments was approximately 17’0.
Individual cells were impaled with two glass
microelectrodes (R = 3-10 MÖhms) filled with 3M KCI
solution. One microelectrode injected a square current
pulse while the other measured the resulting voltage
change. Long hyperpolarizing current pulses were
administered in order to measure Tau and input
resistance.
Various neuroactive peptides and amines were applied
directly onto the ganglia in dosages that, unless
otherwise stated, resulted in a final bath concentration
of 2uM. Except where otherwise noted, perfusion was
