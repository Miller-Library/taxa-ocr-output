DISCUSSION
The responses of the studied autorhythmic cells to
each neuroactive peptide and amine were varied, showing
no dominant pattern. It seems then, that there are a
number of different mechanisms by which individual D.
albopunctata cells respond to a substance. This
discussion focuses on some of the possible mechanisms
by which these cells may operate.
Past studies on FMRF-amide have shown that it
elucidates a wide spectrum of responses in many
different cells. Effects on Aplysia neurons range from a
biphasic excitation-inhibition (Ruben, Johnson and
Thompson, 1984), to complete inhibition. (Stone and
Mayeri, 1981) Furthermore, the giant serotoninergic
neuron of the land snail Helix responds to FMRF-amide
by first increasing a K+ -current near resting potential,
and then reducing a Ca++ and voltage dependent
K+-current at more depolarized voltages. (Cottrell, 1982:
Cottrell et al., 1984) The LP1 burster and LP2 and RP3
beaters of D. albopunctata that we studied proved to be
equally variable in their responses to FMRF-amide. The
LP2 beater's hyperpolarizing response can possibly be
explained by Ruben, Johnson and Thompson's (1984)
reports of an FMRF-amide induced biphasic response in
Aplysia burster neurons L4 and L6. In these cells, an
