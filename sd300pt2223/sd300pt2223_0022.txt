Dopamine proved to exhibit responses that were as
variable as those that our other amine, 5-HT, had
produced. The inhibitory response shown by LP2 can
possibly be explained by the finding that DA has been
shown to cause a decrease in the subthreshold Ca++
current in Aplysia R15. (Lewis, et al., 1984) A decrease
in Ca++ -current could greatly hinder LP2's ability to fire
a spike, as in molluscan neurons, the upstroke of the
action potential consists of a combination of Ca+ and
Na-- currents. If the Ca+--current is eliminated, opening
of Na--channels only may not produce sufficient
depolarization to produce a spike. Even more significant
is that the Ca++- current operates mainly at
subthreshold voltages, and consequently has great power
in determining if a cell will reach threshold. If the lgis
decreased enough, the cell will never depolarize to the
point where enough Na--channels are activated to
initiate an action potential. As a result all firing
activity will be inhibited, which is in fact what the LP2
response was.
The LP1 burster responded to DA by shifting from its
bursting pattern to a high frequency tonic firing pattern.
In Aplysia R15, the same decrease in L just mentioned
acts to increase the interburst hyperpolarization, and at
