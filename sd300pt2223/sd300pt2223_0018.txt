5-HT application. This is consistent with a gradual
inactivation of channels responsible for causing the
initial large, depolarizing response. These inactivated
channels remained in this state during the second and
third 5-HT applications, and so were not available for
opening and resultingly depolarizing the cell. Each
successive 5-HT application then, represents a
progressively decreasing population of inward cation
channels available to depolarize RP3. However, another
possible mechanism that could account for the
desensitzation to 5-HT could lie in downregulation of
5-HT receptors on RP3. No experiments were performed
to test either of these hypotheses, and therefore
represent only speculations at best. Further work to
elucidate the exact mechanism of the 5-HT
desensitization observed in RP3 is needed.
5-HT induced a unique response in the beater RP2.
After a delay time of approximately one and a half
minutes, the cell hyperpolarized and all firing activity
was inhibited. A possible mechanism for this response
lies in Levitan and Levitan's (1988) finding that in
Aplysia R15, 5-HT concentrations at or below 1OuM can
act via increasing CAMP levels to increase the inwardly
rectifying K+-current. With the resulting increase in K+
conductance, the cell resting potential would be driven
