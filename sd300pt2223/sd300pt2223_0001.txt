ABSTRACT
In order to illustrate the usefulness of the dorid
nudibranch Doriopsilla albopunctata for
electrophysiological studies, maps of the pleural ganglia
were made and gross cellular responses of autorhythmic
neurons to applied neuroactive peptides and amines were
observed.
Dopamine, 5-HT and FMRF-amide all induced both
depolarizations and hyperpolarizations in different
autorhythmic cells of D. albopunctata. Responses ranged
from complete inhibition of firing, to increased rate of
repetetive firing in a beating cell, and complete
transformation of bursting activity into beating activity.
In addition, 5-HT induced in a beating cell a
depolarization that attenuated with repeated
applications. 5-HT applied in combination with
FMRF-amide produced varied responses that were not
seen with applications of 5-HT and FMRF-amide
separately.
CPT-CAMP and forskolin, which both serve to enhance
CAMP production, were applied to selected cells in order
to observe if any of the previous cellular responses were
mediated by an increase in cAMP levels. Application of
CPT-CAMP, constituting an increase in CAMP levels only,
