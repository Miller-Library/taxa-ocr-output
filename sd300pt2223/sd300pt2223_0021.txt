conclude that if 1is blocked, the effects will be
manifested in an increase in repetetive firing as well as
erratic spike intervals, which are in fact the effects
forskolin induced.
Finally, forskolin has been found to cause an increase
in an inward cation current near resting potential in a
number of nudibranchs.(Coombs and Thompson, 19871
Although this response may contribute to the
depolarization of the resting potential and the multiple
spikes mentioned earlier, it could also be responsible for
the great deal of synaptic input that was observed in
LP1. This synaptic input might be the effects of forskolin
activating the inward cation current in cells presynaptic
to LPI.
Because forskolin is a known activator of adenylate
cyclase, an increase in cAMP levels is one of the most
feasible mechanisms by which it could exert its effects
on LP1. To test whether CAMP did serve as an
intermediate, we applied CPT-CAMP, a membrane
permeable analog of cAMP that would produce effects in
LP1 that could be the result of a sole increase in cAMF
concentration. Under current and voltage clamping
conditions, no effects of CPT-CAMP were observed
giving strong evidence that forskolin does not act via
CAMP levels, but instead via changes in 1, as suggested
