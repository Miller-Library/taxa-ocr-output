diffuse from application site to receptor site.
Alternatively, the rapidly acting Na--channels could
interact indirectly with FMRF-amide, via an intermediate
mechanism requiring only a few FMRF-amide molecule
interactions to initiate an amplified effect. Here then,
many channels could open in a short period of time. The
slowly activating K+-channels, though, would interact
directly with the FMRF-amide, thereby explaining the lag
time. If each individual K+-channel had to interact
directly with an FMRF-amide molecule, it would take a
reasonable amount of time before enough K+-channels
could be opened to produce an observable response. If the
LP1 burster were to have only the receptors responsible
for the rapidly acting Na--channels, its sole depolarizing
response to FMRF-amide could easily be explained.
Tentative support for this mechanism lies in the
decrease in input resistance observed, which could
correspond to an increase in number of open
Na--channels.
The absence of either of these two possible
FMRF-amide receptors on RP3 could account for a lack of
a gross depolarizing or hyperpolarizing responses.
However, the presence of the FMRF-amide induced erratic
beating pattern and synaptic input could feasibly
represent the depolarizing or hyperpolarizing responses
