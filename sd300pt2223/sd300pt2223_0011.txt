effects of forskolin were long lasting, being visible over
an hour after application even though perfusion was at a
rate of1Occ/min. Input resistance measurements
reflected an increase from 5.25 MÖhms to 7.0 MÖhms
upon application of forskolin. Voltage clamp was
performed on the burster RP1 in the opposite ganglion.
Voltage was stepped from -90mV to -10mV in steps of
+10mV, lasting 100ms each. Under these conditions,
inward rectification was found to decrease by a
maximum of 39.3 at -60mV.
CPT-CAMP was then applied to LPI without perfusion.
Even after 30 minutes, no effect on bursting activity or
input resistance under current clamping conditions was
observed. Voltage clamping under conditions identical to
that of forskolin, resulted in a negligible change in
inward rectification. (Figure 9) CPT-CAMP, then, does
not affect LP1, and more importantly does not seem to
reproduce the effects of forskolin.
Dopamine
Dopamine instantaneously inhibited all firing upon
application to the beater LP2. (Figure 7B) The beating
pattern did eventually recover after perfusion, initially
firing at a slower rate and gradually returning to its
original condition.
