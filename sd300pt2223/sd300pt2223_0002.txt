produced no response. Forskolin produced many effects,
but they did not resemble any responses induced by the
previously applied neuroactive peptides and
amines. It seems then, that the applied neuroactive
peptides and amines do not mediate their actions through
CAMP levels. In addition, although forskolin is a CAMF
analog, from the differing responses to CPT-CAMP and
forskolin, forskolin seems to be inducing its cellular
responses via a mechanism other than a rise in CAMF
concentration.
