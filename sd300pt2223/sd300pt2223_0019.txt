to hyperpolarizing voltages near the reversal potential
for K+ (around -70my), resulting in an inhibition of
cellular activity. The lag time observed before the
response, however, could indicate another possible
mechanism involving either Cl- channels or a different
set of K+-channels located far away from the site of
5-HT application, which do not operate via CAMP. These
are only suggested mechanisms, as we did not perform
any voltage clamp or CAMP analog experiments, and
therefore cannot be sure that 5-HT does actually act
through CAMP to affect the inwardly rectifying
K+-current.
The results of the CPT-CAMP and forskolin
applications indicated that none of the applied
neuroactive peptides or amines operate using cAMP as an
intermediate. In addition, it appears that although
forskolin is a stimulator of CAMP production, the effects
resulting from its application are due to mechanisms
other than increased levels of CAMP.
In LP1, forskolin caused a number of effects that did
not resemble any of the responses of the other applied
neuroactive peptides and amines, giving the first
indication that these substances did not operate via a
CAMP intermediate. Evidence for a possible mechanism
underlying the various responses to forskolin lies in the
