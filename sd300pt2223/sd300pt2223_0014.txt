inward current increase carried by Na+ ions starts
approximately 100-200ms after FMRF-amide application,
followed by an outward current increase carried by K+
ions that begins approximately 2-5s after peptide
application. Due to the rapid onset of the voltage change
induced by the first depolarizing phase of the
FMRF-amide response, it could have easily been obscured
using our current clamping methodology. But the latter,
delayed, hyperpolarizing phase of the peptide response
which is easily seen, could feasibly account for the
inhibition of firing that was observed in LP2. An increase
in outward K+-current could act to keep LP2 in a
hyperpolarized, nonfiring state, as well as to counteract
any depolarizing stimuli it might have received.
Ruben, Johnson and Thompson (1984) also postulate
that the presence of two separate ion channels could
account for the observed immediate and delayed
responses to FMRF-amide. The inward Na--channels that
are instantaneously opened possibly involve one set of
receptors located at or near the site of peptide
application. The outward K+-channels, however, open
with a delay time that could be accounted for by the
existence of a separate set of receptors located further
away from the site of peptide application. The lag time,
then, represents the time taken for the FMRF-amide to
