RESULTS
Identification of Autorhythmic Cells
We were able to map the dorsal side of the
asymmetrical pleural ganglia using morphologhical and
electophysiological means of identification. Our map
represents a composite of all the individual ganglion
observed (Figure 1). Each side of the ganglia yielded a
cell with a characteristic bursting pattern. These cells
were consistently large and whitish in appearance. LP1
is one of two large cells in the left ganglia located
furthest anteriorly. RP2, meanwhile, proves more
difficult to locate as there are many large cells in the
right ganglia, with seemingly greater variablity amongst
individual D. albopunctata. The most reliable
characteristic of RP1 is its whitish glow, clearly visible
even through the epineural sheath. The beating cell LP2,
is typically the largest and most posterior cell in this
view of the left pleural ganglia. RP2 resides in a cluster
of three cells located most anteriorly in this ganglia,
each of which is about half the diameter of the numerous
large cells below. Due to the aforementioned ganglia
topographic variablity, RP3 was difficult to map,
although it is usually a medium sized cell found in the
vicinity of the base of the nerve root.
