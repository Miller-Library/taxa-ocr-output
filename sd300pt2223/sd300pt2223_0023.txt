times to stop all bursting activity altogether. (Ã„scher,
1972) As this reported response is directly contrary to
the depolarizing response observed, it seems safe to say
that DA is not exerting its effects here via 1-Although
DA may be acting to increase an inward cation
conductance in LP1, it is hard to say anything about the
underlying mechanisms, as the change in firing pattern is
all the data that could be collected in this experiment.
Doriopsilla albopunctata neurons show a wide
spectrum of responses to the various neuroactive
peptides and amines applied to them. Although we have
just barely scratched the surface of the pharmacology of
these various cells, we hope that we have sparked an
interest in this useful animal for further studies. As
some of the observed responses were unexplainable by
traditional mechanisms, elucidation of the exact
mechanisms by which the cells responded will serve to
enhance knowledge of neuropharmacology immensely.
