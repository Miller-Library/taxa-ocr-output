was measured 60s after administration of 5-HT in three
separate dosages, with perfusion between each.
Following the first application, spike interval dropped
dramatically from a control of 3.5s to 0.5s, and
thereafter increased progressively to 2.9s and 3.25s in
the second and third applications, respectively. (Figure
5-1,2,3) Input resistance measurements showed a
gradual increase from 12 MOhms to 21.3 MOhms and 22.0
MÃ–hms in applications one, two and three, respectively.
5-HT produced a delayed response in cell RP2 (Figure
4A), inhibiting its beating pattern approximately 1.5 min.
after application. The original firing pattern did
eventually resume.
Forskolin and Chlorophenylthio-CAMP (CPT-CAMP)
To observe whether any of the applied neuroactive
peptides or amines exerted their effects via CAMP, we
increased the intracellular levels of CAMP by applying
CPT-CAMP, a membrane permeable cyclic AMP analog, and
forskolin, a known stimulator of CAMP production.
In cell LP1, forskolin inhibited bursting activity and
initiated an erratic beating pattern characterized by
much synaptic input. (Figure 6) In addition, doublets,
triplets and trains of up to five spikes replaced the
single spikes in the original bursting condition. The
