360.6ms to 354.3ms with 5-HT alone, then to a final
value of 285.7ms when combined with FMRF-amide.
Of particular interest in studying this cell's
pharmacology is the evidence for synaptic input after the
application of 5-HT amd FMRF-amide. It manifested
itself in the form of instantaneous, excitatory bursts,
which increased spike frequency whether the cell was in
a bursting or beating state. In addition, interburst
hyperpolarizations were not smooth, and spikes rose
sharply rather than gradually depolarizing.
5-HT
Serotonin produced a depolarization in the LPI
burster (Figure 3A,B) and the LP2 beater (Figure 4B),
exciting both to a high rate of repetetive firing. Voltage
clamping of the LP2 beater revealed an insignificant
change in inward rectification, although the spike
interval decreased from 2.75-3.0s to 1.36s. Clamping of
the burster LP1 when exposed to a 5-HT bath
concetration of 10 uM, however, revealed a marked
decrease in inward rectification of 1.43 nA at -90mV to
89 nA at -60mV. (Figure 8)
In the beating cell RP3, 5-HT application also induced
a higher rate of repetetive firing, but the response
attenuated with successive applications. Spike interval
