proposed mechanism of 5-HT. Levitan and Levitan (1988)
found that in the Aplysia burster R15, a 5-HT
concentration of 500uM (Tremblay et al., 1976) could act
via an increase in CAMP levels to increase the
subthreshold calcium current, causing an enhancement of
the depolarized phase of the bursting cycle. Although the
5-HT concentrations applied to the cells in our
experiments only had a final bath concentration of 2uM,
application method was such that 5-HT concentrations
exceeding 500uM could have been possible. To test this
CAMP mediated increase in LACPT-CAMP was applied to
LP2, with no observable response. Therefore, although
the depolarizing effects caused by 5-HT in LP2 may still
be mediated by an increase in L,,5-HT is not acting via
CAMP to produce this response. However, a CAMP
mediated depolarization has not yet been ruled out for
LPI and RP3, as CPT-CAMP was not applied to these
cells.
The beating cell RP3 also exhibited a depolarizing
response to 5-HT, but differed from LPI and LP2 in that
the excitatory response desensitized. The progressive
increase in spike interval from the first to the third
5-HT application exhibits this attenuation well. A
possible mechanism can be deduced from the observation
of a gradually increasing input resistance with each
