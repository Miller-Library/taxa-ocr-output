not operating until after observation of the initial gross
effects of the applied substances. Perfusion continued at
a rate of 1-10cc/min. until the control condition was
resumed.
Selected cells were then voltage clamped using two
microelectrodes similar to those used in the current
clamp. One electrode maintained the cell at a constant
holding voltage of -40mV, while the other measured the
underlying currents resulting from voltage steps from
the holding voltage.
