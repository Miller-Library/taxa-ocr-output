INTRODUCTION
Little work has been done on the nudibranch
Doriopsilla albopunctata although it is an ideal organism
for studying electrophysiology. Easy accessibility and
preparation, great viability and large easily identified
neurons are all good reasons why D. albopunctata should
be taken advantage of and studied further.
In our study of the pharmacology of various D.
albopunctata bursting and beating cells located in the
pleural ganglia, we observed both depolarizing and
hyperpolarizing responses to the applied neuroactive
peptides and amines, with none having a dominant effect
on all of the cells observed. We conclude from our
studies that the autorhythmic neurons of D. albopunctata
have various, differing mechanisms by which they
respond to a particular substance, depending on
individual cellular properties. These differences may lie
at the level of receptors, second messengers, ion channel
properties, etc. Comparing our results with known
cellular responses to the same neuroactive peptides and
amines on similar Aplysia neurons, we then determined
if they could also possibly account for our observations.
In some D. albopunctata cells, the mechanisms
operating in Aplysia could feasibly underly our observed
responses.
