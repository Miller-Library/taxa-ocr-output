FMRF-amide
FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) instantaneously
depolarized the LP1 burster, converting all bursting
activity into tonic spiking activity. (Figure 2B) An input
resistance drop from a control of 6.5 MÖhms to 1.5
Möhms was also observed. In the beating LP2 cell, on the
other hand, we observed complete inhibition of firing
upon peptide application. (Figure 24)
Disruption of beating pattern was observed in the
rapidly firing RP3 beater. After FMRF-amide application,
the constant control spike interval of 800ms fluctuated
from 680ms to 960ms. From the appearance of synaptic
input during these intervals, we hypothesize that cells
presynaptic to RP3 exhibit responses to FMRF-amide that
consequently affect RP3. AII FMRF-amide effects on all
cells studied were reversible upon perfusion.
FMRF-amide and 5-HT
A 1:1 ratio of 5-HT and FMRF-amide applied during a
5-HT induced tonic spiking condition in the LP1 burster
resulted in an input resistance drop greater than that of
5-HT alone. While 5-HT lowered input resistance from
15.4 MÖhms to 14.4 MÖhms, the input resistance dropped
to 10.2 MÖhms with the combination of 5-HT and
FMRF-amide. Tau also decreased from a control of
