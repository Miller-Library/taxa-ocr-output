SUMMARY
Studies were made on amino acid uptake into alcohol
soluble and alcohol-insoluble products by the polychaete,
Cirriformia spirabrancha. A radioactive tracer method was
used employing glycine-UL-C+. The uptake vs. wet weight
relationship was linear, and can be expressed as Uptake - kW.
The body wall and tentacles were the major areas of uptake,
with the tentacles having a rate five times as great as the
body on a weight basis. Uptake vs. external concentration
was also studied. The Vmax was 2.4 x 10-6 M/g per hour and
the Km was 1.2 X10-4 M/L.
