Since the worms differed in weight, it was necessary
to find the relation between wet weight and total rate of
uptake. When wet weight was plotted against total rate of
uptake. (figure 2), it was found that a linear relationship
existed.
The total rate of uptake increases as the external
glycine concentration increases, up to an external concentration
of 5 x10- "/L. At this concentration the rate of uptake is no
longer affected by an increase in external concentration
(figure 3). This uptake curve is characteristic of a transport
system.
Other experiments indicate that the gut is not
involved in uptake, since ligation of the head and tail
regions had no effect on uptake rate. This suggests the major
sites of uptake are through the body wall and tentacles.
Table 1 compares uptake of the body and tentacles
on a weight basis. In this experiment the worms were
incubated in C+ glycine for the indicated periods of time.
At the end of the incubation period the tentacles and body
were separated from each other and the uptake determined.
The results show that the tentacles are five times more
effective in uptake, on a weight basis, than is the body wall.
DISCUSSION
The uptake vs. wet weight relation in C. spirabrancha
can be expressed as Uptake - kW, where k is a constant and W
is wet weight. This means that uptake varies directly with
