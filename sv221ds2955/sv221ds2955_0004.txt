the volume of the worm, where one would expect uptake to
vary directly with the surface area. One explanation for
this is that surface area also varies directly with volume
or weight. This is not too hard to imagine if one considers
that this worm and its tentacles have a great capacity for
stretching. This means that it has a great surface area per
volume and also that a change in volume is mostly indicated
in a change in length which is proportional to surface area.
Thus it seems that surface area might indeed vary directly
with volume over the range of weights used in this study.
Stephens (1964) showed that the radioactivity of
the alcohol-soluble fraction of an extract of Clymenella
Torquata resided in glycine alone. This is probably true
in the present experiments also, especially since the incubation
periods were relatively short.
The total rate of uptake and the rate of incorporation
of alcohol-insoluble material are linear for at least 120
minutes, whereas the rate of concentration of free glycine
slows down with time. There are two explanations for the
rate of concentration slowing down with time. One is that
the enzyme system may not be capable of increasing the
concentration gradient any further and thus the rate of
concentration will level off. The other is that the worm
has probably markedly depleted the external concentration of
glycine over the two hour period and this low external
concentration may be a limiting factor for the transport
system. This latter explanation seems quite plausible since
