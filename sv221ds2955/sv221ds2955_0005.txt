the worm was in only lOml of solution for two hours.
The total rate of uptake vs. concentration relation
or C. spirabrancha is similar to those of other marine
invertebrates studied by Stephens and his co-workers.
Stephens (1968) gives the typical ranges of Vmax and Km
for the organisms he has studied. Vmax (maximum rate of
uptake) ranges between 10-7 and 10-5 moles/g per hour and
Km (concentration at which a half maximal rate of uptake
occurs) ranges between 10-4 and 10-5 M/L. Calculations
derived from the data of figure 3, depicted in figure 4,
show that C. spirabrancha has a Vmax of 2.4 x10-6 M/g per hour
and a Km of 1.2x10-4 "/L, both well within the ranges given
by Stephens.
