INTRODUCTION
It has been shown by Stephens and his co-workers
that many marine invertebrates can accumulate amino acids from
ambient seawater (Stephens, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1967, 1968; Stephens
and Schinske, 1961; Stephens and Virkar, 1966; North and Stephens,
1961; and Virkar, 1966). The present study further examines
some of the characteristics of amino acid uptake and utilization
in the cirratulid polychaete, Cirriformia spirabrancha. The
amino acid glycine was used for this study because it is the
most abundant free amino acid in seawater. Studies were made
to determine the rate of concentration, the rate of incorporation
into alcohol insoluble material, the total rate of uptake, and
the anatomical sites of amino acid uptake.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Worms were collected from sandy areas just south
of Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California and stored in the
laboratory under simulated natural conditions until used,
usually between one and five days after collection. The worms
were washed free of external mucous and sand, blotted on filter
paper to remove excess water, weighed to the nearest 10 mg.
and placed in room temperature seawater (20-22Â°c). The wet
weight varied between.14 and.40 grams. Various concentrations
of glycine solution were made in artificial seawater by
dissolving C glycine (Sigma Chemical Corp.) in a constant
amount of glycine-UL-Ct (ICN, specific activity 76.0 m0/mM).
In a number of experiments, indicated in the figure legends,
glycine anhydride (NBC) was mistakenly used in place of the
18.
