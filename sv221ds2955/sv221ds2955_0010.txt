Figure 1: Curve 1 gives the total rate of glycine uptake
over a two hour period; curve 2 shows the rate of incorporation
of free glycine into alcohol-insoluble material; curve 3 shows
the concentration of free glycine in the worm. External
glycine concentration is .65 X10-째 M/L with glycine anhydride
at a concentration of .5 X10-6 M/L.
Figure 2: The rate of uptake (in counts per minute per worm)
vs. the wet weight of the worm in grams. External glycine
concentration .65 X10-째 M/L with glycine anhydride at a
concentration of ,5 X10-6 M/L. Incubation time was 15 min.
Figure 3: The effect of external concentration vs. internal
concentration in moles per liter. External concentration varied
from .65 x10 째 to 10-2 M/L. Incubation time was 15 min.
Figure 4: The reciprocal of external concentration vs. the
reciprocal of internal concentration (M/L/15 min.). The slope
of the line indicates Km and the intercept indicates Vmax.
This figure was calculated from figure 3.
Table 1: A comparison of rate of concentration on a weight
basis of glycine between the tentacles and body over a 15
minute period. The numbers indicate 10-
/9 . The external
glycine concentration was .65 X10째 M/L with glycine anhydride
at a concentration of .5X10-0 M/L.
