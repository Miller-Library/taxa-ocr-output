glycine. Each worm was placed in 10ml of one of these
solutions which ranged in concentration from .65x10-0 M/L
to 10-3 "/L. After a stipulated period of time, the worm
was washed for 30 seconds in seawater, homogenized in a tissue
homogenizer in 20 volumes of 80% ethanol, and then centrifuged
for 10 minutes in a clinical centrifuge. The supernatant
was saved while the pellet was washed again in 80% ethanol,
centrifuged and dissolved in 10 volumes of formic acid. O.lml
aliquots of the supernatant and dissolved pellet were then
placed on separate planchets, spread with 0.5ml formic acid,
evaporated under an infra-red lamp, and radioactivity measured
with a thin window Geiger-Muller detector. Radioactivity of
each glycine-seawater solution was also measured in this manner
after plating 0.lml of the solution with 0.5ml 80% ethanol and
evaporating in a drying oven. All samples were taken in
triplicate and corrections for background and quenching have
been included in the data presented.
RESULTS
The three major parameters of uptake are the
concentration of free glycine in the worm (alcohol-soluble
radioactivity), the rate of incorporation of glycine into
proteins and nucleic acids (alcohol-insoluble radioactivity),
and the total rate of uptake (total radioactivity). Figurell
shows that uptake of free glycine is linear for at least 60
minutes, and that rate of incorporation and total rate of
uptake are linear for the two hour period.
