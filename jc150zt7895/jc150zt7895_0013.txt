All twenty animals with clamped ctenidia kept under
dry conditions were still alive one day after the clamping
operation. Testing of ten of these animals showed the
tension of the pericardial sinus to be higher than that of
the visceral cavity, this difference being greater than in
submerged animals with clamped ctenidia, and about the same
as in normal animals under dry conditions.
The second day after the clamping operation two of
the ten dry animals had died. Testing of the remaining
sight showed the Og tension of the pericardial sinus
till be greater than that in the visceral cavity, although
the absolute tension in both were slightly lower than the
previous day.
tour lines of evidence indicate that the mantle fold
serves a respiratory role in the limpet Acmaea. These are
1) the presence of a capillary system close to the surface
fthe mantle fold, (2) a counter-current ciliary system
assing over the mantle fold, (3) the dilation of the
mantle fold with blood, and the concomitant decreased size
of the ctenidia, when the animal is dry, and (4) the polaro-
graphic evidence that the O, tension of the blood is higher
