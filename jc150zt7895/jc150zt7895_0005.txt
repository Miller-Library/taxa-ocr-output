The first of these areas, the ctenidium, is generall
considered the respiratory organ of Acmaea. Colloidal carbor
injections of this organ colored the major efferent and
afferent vessels and the capillaries of the right and lef
thirds of the etenidial filaments, but not the central por-
tions of the filaments. The filament vessels, however, wer-
stained in their totality with vital dyes.
These observa-
tions indicate that capillaries sufficiently fine to prevent
the passage of colloidal carbon connect the efferent an
afferent vessels.
The other area where a large amount of blood flow
ound close to the surface was the ventral side of the
mantle fold facing the mantle groove. Blood enters the
mantle fold from the visceral cavity through vessels whic
pass through the shell muscle fibers. In the area between
the base of the mantle groove and the circumpallial vessel
these vessels anastomose. The density of interconnecting
vessels in this network is extraordinary (see plate I, 1-3.)
Near the circumpallial vessel (Figure 2) the vessels of thi
network come together to form a highly branched pattern.
Blood in these vessels goes to the edge of the mantle,
servicing the glands and pallial tentacles, returns to the
anterior afferent vessel, and thence to the heart. As in
the ctenidium, there were fine capillaries in the mantle
fold near the circumpallial vessel which could not be
