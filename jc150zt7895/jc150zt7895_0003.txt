The limpets of the genus Acmaea are found in abundance
in the rocky intertidal zone on the shores of the Monterey
sninsula, California. Individuals of the species Acmaea
scabra (Could, 1846) and A. digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833,
are found high in zones one and two described by Ricketts
and Calvin (1962). Other species common to this area, A.
elta Eschscholtz, 1833; A. limatula Carpenter,
1864; A. asmi
1833; are
Middendorff, 1849); and A. scutum Eschscholtz,
found under water much of the time lower down in zones three
and four.
These species differences in esposure suggested that
Amaea must be capable of differing derees of respiration
in air and water. The aim of this study was to determine
the site(s) of the specialised respiratory surfaces of
Acmaea, and to list their respiratory effectiveness when
posed to air and when submerged

Initially the anatomy of the circulatory system wa
nvestigated. It was assumed that gas diffusion could
ceur across any body surface and that a specialized respir
atory area might be one where gas exchange was facilitated
blood flow close to the external body surface
