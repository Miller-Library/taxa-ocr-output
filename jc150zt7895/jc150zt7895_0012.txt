that the O, tension was higher in the latter area. Because
lood flows from the visceral cavity to the anterior af-
ferent vessel through the vessels of the mantle fold,
gaseous exchange must occur at the mantle-fold surface.
In the next group of experiments the ctenidial
respiration was eliminated, and the respiratory effici
of the mantle fold determined. Small lead clamps, cut
from thin sheets of lead and bent in "V" shapes, were
inched around the ctenidial afferent and efferent
vesse
fanimals relaxed in Nocl,. The treated animals, kept
vernicht in either wet or dry environments, were tested
during the following days and then sacrificed and examine
ascertain whether the clamps were still in place and
funtioning.
twenty animals kept under water, nineteen were
till alive one day after the clamping operation. Testing
f ten of these animals showed (Table 1) the Op tension of
the pericardial sinus to be somewhat higher than that of
the visceral cavity, although the differences were le
than in normal, unclamped animals.
The second day after the operation the remaining
nine limpets kept under water were dead. This experiment
was performed twice, and each time all the animals were
dead by the second day.
