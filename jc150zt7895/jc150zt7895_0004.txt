Individuals of the species Acmaea scutum, A. pelta
and A. digitalis from low, middle, and high intertidal zones
respectively, were taken as samples. The principal method
of study was injection of colored substances into the cireu
tory system.
Injections were carried out with twenty-six gauge
ypodermic needles or fine glass needles pulled from soft
glass tubing. A number of different injection fluids were
ried, including latex, vital stains dissolved in alcohol
or water, and commercial inks. Best results were obtained
with an aqueous colloidal suspension of carbon. The tissue.
remained relaxed during the carbon injections and the pa
ticles did not diffuse out of the vessels. Successful
njections were made on both live, fresh animals and on
animals relaxed in a solution of Mg Gl, isotonic with sea
water. Large areas of the circulatory system were colored
by injections into the heart or visceral cavity. For stud
of localized areas, injections were made into local vessels.
Blood flow direction was determined by observation of the
essels during injections of a dilute carbon suspension.
Gross blood flow, determined by the above methods,
shown in Figure 1. The results indicate two separate
ind distinct areas-the ctenidium and the mantle--where
there is a large amount of blood flow close to the animal.
