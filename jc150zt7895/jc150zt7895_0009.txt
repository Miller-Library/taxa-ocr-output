reduced in sise compared to the etenidia of A. pelta,
limatula, and A. scutum.
These field studies indicate that the mantle is the
tte of increased blood flow when the animal is out of the
water, whereas the ctenidium is usually the site of similar
increased flow when the animal is under water. Under waten
the elongated, filamentous ctenidium is a principal wetted
surface. Out of the water, however, the ctenidium contracts
and the surface of the mantle fold is kept wet at the expense
of water in the nuchal cavity, suggesting that the mantle
fold is the chief respiratory site in dry environments.
The laboratory and field observations show that ctenidi
longation and mantle swelling may be controlled by the
water or air environment, and also suggest an evolutionar
reduction in the ctenidium and a corresponding increase in
mantle capacity from low to high intertidal species

Polargraphic methods were used to substantiate the
spiratory functions of the ctenidium and mantle indicated
nthe previous studies. Electrodes of the recessed type
irst deseribed by Brink and Davies (1942) were used to
measure the difference in the oxygen tensions in different
parts of the body of Acmaea.
