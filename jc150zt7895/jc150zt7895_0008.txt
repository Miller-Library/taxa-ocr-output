nuchal cavity, and in A. scabra which had been dry for many
hours and whose nuchal cavity was no longer filled with
water, the ctenidium was hardly visible. The above char-
acteristics were observed in members of all species but
were particularly evident in A. scabra and A. digitalis.
When an Acmaea individual was under water, its shel
was elevated one to three millimeters off the substrate,
its mantle protruded somewhat beyond the edge of the shell
and a ciliary current in the nuchal cavity, demonstrated
with carmine particles in a quiet pool, flowed counter
tenidial blood flow. When an animal was overturned and
ompared with a member of the same species from a dry area,
the wet animal's mantle appeared flatter and the mantle
vessels seemed smaller in diameter.
in the laboratory where the ventral side of submerged
Acmaea could be observed through aquaria walls, the ctenidia
fA. scutum, A. pelta, and A. limatula were consistentl
found extended and lying partially in the right mantle
groove. In A. scabra and A. digitalis taken from high,
y areas and kept under water in aquaria for forty-eight
r more hours, the ctenidia were never seen to extend more
than one-half the distance from the back to the front of th
nuchal cavity. They are, therefore, apparently not suf-
iciently long to extend to the mantle groove, and are much
