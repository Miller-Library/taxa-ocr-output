KINGSTON, ROGER S. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University,
Pagific Grove, California). Anatomical and Oxygen Electrode Studies
of Respiratory Surfaces and Respiration in Acmaea (Mollusca: Gastropoda:
Prosobranchia). The Veliger
Colloidal carbon injection showed that blood flow is close to
the external surfaces in the ctenidium and the mantle facing the
mantle groove, and that blood flows through one ov the other of these
areas just before returing to the heart. A ciliary counter-current
was also found associated with each of these surfaces. Field
observations showed the mantle vessel network expands and ctenidium
withdraws when out of the water. The low intertidal species Acmaea
scutum,A. pelta, and A. limatula have larger ctenidia and smaller
mantle expansion capabilities than the high intertidal species
A. digitalis and A. scabra. Micro-oxygen electrode measurements
indicate that both the mantle and the ctenidium are respiratory
surfaces, and that the mantle is more effective in aerial
conditions and the ctenidium more effective in submerged conditions.
