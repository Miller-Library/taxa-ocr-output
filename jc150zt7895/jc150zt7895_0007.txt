Because of the large amount of blood flow close to
the surface, the type of veination, the position relative
to the heart in terms of blood flow, and the ciliary
sounter-currents, both the etenidium and the mantle are
here suggested as respiratory surfaces in Acmaea.
FTELD OBSERVATTONS
Acmaea scabra and A. digitalis from zones one and
two, A. pelta and A. limatula from zone three, and A. scutum
from zone four were observed in the field to record the
behavior of the mantle and ctenidium under dry and wet
conditions. The study was qualitative; observations were
made of animals on dry rocks, on splashed rocks, and in
quiet pools with the aid of a ten-power lens.
When an individual had been out of the water for e
ong enough period to have adjusted to the lack of water,
the following characteristics were usually evident. The
shell was pulled down onto the surface of the rock substr
(though not tightly clamped), the mantle fold was wet (as
found in Lottia: Abbott, 1956), and when the animal was
isturbed it clamped down tightly with some water often
exuding from the mantle groove. If the animal was taken
from the rock and turned over, the wet area of the mantle
fold between the foot and circumpallial vessel was notice-
ably swoilen, and the vessels appeared dilated and gorged
The ctenidium was found to be withdrawn in the
with blood.
