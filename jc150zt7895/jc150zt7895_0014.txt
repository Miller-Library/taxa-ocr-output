through the ctenidium.
These results demonstrate that better gascous exchang
ccurs at the mantle surface in air than in water, and that
Acmaea has physiological and behavioral adaptations which
allow it to better expose the mantle in air and the ctenidium
in water.
That Acmaea uses both etenidium and mantle fold a.

gills (Abbott, 1956), and Patella,
which has no etenidium
and respires solely with ciliated flaps fringing the margin
of the circumpallial vessel
