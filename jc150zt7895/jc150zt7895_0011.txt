calibration step, an amps. vs. /02/ curve (Figure 6, line
was determined for each cathode, using three to five sea
water samples of known O, content (by Winkler method).
These cathodes were very stable, with little or no changes
evident in the calibration curve from day to day.
Al experiments and calibrations were performed at
To compensate for minor temperature fluctuations
during an experiment (a one degree change resulted in as
much as a ten per cent change in current flow), the 0
ension at two-three different sites on the animal were
imultaneously measured with two-three different cathodes.
neach experiment the animal, previously kept in
he desired environment for a minimum of four hours, was
placed upside-down and the cathodes inserted into the
esired tissue or circulatory vessels, through holes pre
iously made with a dissecting needle. The cathodes wer-
left in place and supported in small ring stands, whereas
he anode was placed on the tissue only at the time
measurement.
In the first experiments, comparisons were made o
lood oxygen in the visceral cavity, the anterior afferen
vessel, and the pericardial sinus. The results (Table 1
show that the O2 tension is higher in the pericardial sinus
in both aerobic and aquatic conditions. Comparing the
visceral cavity with the anterior afferent vessel showed
