UDMARI
The circulatory systen of Aemaea was injected with
olloidal carbon. Two areas - the ctenidium and the mantle
were found where a large amount of blood flous close
the animals' external surfaces. Blood flows through one o
the other of these surfaces immediately before it returns
o the heart. A ciliary counter-current was found associ
with each of these surfaces.
When observed in the field, the mantle fold was
un to expand and the ctenidium to contract when the
animal was out of water. Conversely the ctenidium elongates
and the mantle fold flattens under water. Low intertidal
species of Acmaea have larger ctenidia and smaller mantle
respiratory capacities than higher intertidal species.
Oxygen polargraphy was used to measure the oxygen
tensions of the blood in different parts of Acmaea. These
measurements indicate that both the mantle and the ctenidium
are respiratory surfaces, and that the mantle is more ef-
fective in aerial conditions and the ctenidium more effec
tive in submerged conditions.
