The possible role of the mantle fold as a respirator,

described in Acmaea by Yonge (1962) and believed to be

role
To observe these currents, carmine particles suspended
sea water were placed in the mantle groove of over-turne
animals. A circular current in the mantle groove was found
moving in a plane perpendicular toithe side of the foot and
o the animal's substratum. This ciliary current moved
opposite to the direction of blood flow in the mantle and
was a counter-current of the type often associated with
respiratory surfaces (see Figure 3). A similar ciliar
