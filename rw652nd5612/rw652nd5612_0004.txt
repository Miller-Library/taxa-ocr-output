most intelligible and reproducible; it is shown in Figure
III. Evidently, most of the activity of the enzyme occurs
within twelve minutes. Time courses with enzyme-free bac-
teria extract showed no breakdown and consequently no secre-
tion of enzyme during incubation.
DISCUSSION
It is somewhat surprising that only three of the seven
algal polysaccharides tested were degraded in the gut of
C. spirabrancha. In view of the worm's non-specific eating
habits a wide digestive capability would seem most useful.
Other common inhabitants of the intertidal such as the gas-
tropods Tegula funebralis and Helix pomatia (Reviewed by
WILBUR and YONGE, 1966) possess large complements of carboÂ¬
hydrases. Before conclusions can be drawn, however, about
which enzymes might be expected to occur in the gut of C.
spirabrancha, more information about sugar digestion in
other polychaetes is needed.
Although they are suggestive, the places of enzyme ac-
tivity found do not strictly delineate the sites of enzyme
origin or physiological function. Surely digestion can be
expected in the stomach and fore-intestine; it is breakdown
in the rear-intestine which should be questioned. This area
is characterized by a thin, transparent gut wall, scant blood
supply, and gut contents which are in a pellet- or string-
form. These factors indicate that profitable digestion prob-
ably does not take place in the rear-intestine.
Digestion in polychaetes is at least predominantly ex-
tracellular. (Meglitsch, 1967), and this fact complicates
identification of the source of enzymes. The very low ac-
