of bacteria, were also plated to provide a comparison of
activity.
Secondly, one ml. aliquots of the enzyme-free extract
were incubated in the usual manner and assayed for degrada-
tion of sugar by freshly secreted enzyme at twelve-minute
intervals over a seventy-two minute period.
RESULTS
Three sugars were broken down by extracts of the gut:
laminarin, starch, and cellulose. No positive evidence was
found for hydrolysis of the other substrates. Opening and
washing the gut resulted in extracts with very greatly de-
creased activities. Figure 1 shows the amounts of break-
down by one ml. of gut in one hour expressed in glucoseÂ¬
equivalent units. Activity was greatest using a buffer at
pH 5.5. Reduced degradation took place at pH 6.2, and there
was practically none at ph 7.5.
Enzyme action was found in extracts from three portions
of the gut: stomach, fore-intestine, and rear-intestine. The
buccal cavity, pharynx, and esophagus homogenized together
showed no activity. Values for starch and laminarin break-
down by region are found in Figure 2. Similar assays for
degradation of cellulose were not made.
My attempts to determine the role of bacteria in enzyme
secretion have not yielded positive results. Colonies were-
established on the nutrient plates, but even after three days
they broke down little starch relative to the amout degraded
by bacteria-free enzyme extract. No satisfactory time course
for hydrolysis of sugars was derived. That for starch is the
