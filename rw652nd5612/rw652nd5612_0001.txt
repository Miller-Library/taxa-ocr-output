INTRODUCTION
Little is known about digestive enzymes in polychaetes.
Where general classes of enzymes have been identified, their
origins and sites of action have often remained undetermined.
have attempted to describe the carbohydrases in the gut of
Cirriformia spirabrancha, a polychaete which inhabits sulfide-
rich mud and sand and apparently eats a widely varied diet of
microscopic debris. Laminarin, starch, and cellulose have
been found to be degraded by extracts of the gut of the annelid,
and enzyme action tentatively located in the stomach and fore-
intestine. The roles of the worm and its intestinal bacteria
in this digestion were examined without definitive results.
MATERTALS AND METHOLS
Large worms were collected fresh daily in the intertidal
area during low tide at Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California.
The specimens were anesthesized for one hour in magnesium chlor-
ide-sea-water solution, pH 7.7, and the alimentary tube then
dissected out. About .3ml. of tissue and contents was yielded
by the intact gut of a worm; .lml. by a gut opened and washed
free of contents. The gut was homogenized in the cold with a
Teflon pestle in a glass tube using an artificial sea-water (ln-
stant Ocean, Aquarium Systems Inc., Wickliffe, Ohio) as the momo-
genization medium. The supernatant after light centrifugation
in the cold was used as the enzyme extract.
Seven sugar substrates were tested: laminarin (Pierce
Chemical Co.), agar (Difco Chemical Co.), and chitin (Eastman
Chemical Co.) as 0.5% suspensions; fucoidin (Pierce Chemical
Co.), and alginic acid (Pierce Chemical Co.) as 0.5% solutions;
