SUMMARY
Laminarin, starch, and cellulose are found to be de-
graded by extracts of the gut of Cirriformia spira-
brancha.
The stomach and fore-intestine of the annelid are iden-
tified as the probable sites of enzyme action.
Differentiation of the abilities of C. spirabrancha
to synthesize carbohydrases was attempted without
definitive results.
