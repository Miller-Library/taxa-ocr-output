soluble starch (Malinkrodt Chemical Works) as a 0.14 and
carboxymethylcellulose (Hercules Powd. Co.) a 1.0% solution.
A one ml. aliquot of extract, one ml. of sugar substrate,
and three ml. of Tris-maleate buffer (GOMORRI, 1955) com-
prised the incubation medium.
Sugar breakdown was assayed by the Somogyi method as
adapted by Nelson (1944) for reducing sugar. AKlett-
Summerson photoelectric colorimeter was used to determine
per cent absorption at 540mu. and this value read against
a standard glucose curve to find amount of reducing sugar
liberated. Appropriate enzyme and sugar controls were con-
ducted. Correction for dilution was made to obtain a fig-
ure for enzyme potency in one ml. of gut tissue or tissue
and contents.
Two methods were used to determine the ability of the
intestinal bacteria of C. spirabrancha to secrete carbohy-
drases. First, the particulate fraction after centrifuga-
tion, which contained the bacteria present in te homogenate,
was washed ten thousand-fold in sterilized artificial sea-
water by alternate resuspension and centrifugation to di-
lute enzyme concentration. Resuspended it was used as a
"bacteria extract." One-tenth ml. aliquots of this solution
were spread on a sterile growth medium consisting of 0.1%.
yeast extract (Difco), 1% starch, 2% agar, and sea-water.
After seventy-eight hours the plates were washed with po-
tassium iodide-iodine solution and breakdown of starch de-
termined by the presence of clear areas. Aliquots of the
supernatant upon the initial centrifugation, which was free
