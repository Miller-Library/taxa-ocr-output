tivities of extracts from opened and washed gut tissue nei-
ther proves nor disproves enzyme synthesis in the gut walls.
No histochemical examination of the gut has been made and it
is not known if secretory-type cells are present.
It was thought that possibly magnesium ions in the anes-
thesizing and dissecting solution caused the release of en-
zymes from tissue before the gut was transfered for homogen-
ization. Preliminary studies with dissection made in sea-
water show a continued absence of laminarinase or amylase in
gut tissue. A cellulase, may be present in significant amounts;
difficulty persists, however, with a turbidity in the colored
cellulose solutions.
Microscopic examination of the gut contents of C. spira-
brancha reveals bacteria in large numbers in all regions.
Strains of bacteria have been shown capable of breaking down
starch, cellulose, agar, chitin, and a carrageenin. In many
animals the role of bacteria in digestion is important; in
others they are present in the gut, but not thought signifi-
cant in the secretion of enzymes. The cultures obtained showed
that the bacteria of C. spirabrancha can secrete an amylase,
but its potency may be limited. The time courses made indi-
cate the bacteria do not secrete an enzyme under the exper-
imental conditions. Further study of this problem should be
carried out. For example, large quantities of the bacteria
could be cultured and the degree to which they are able to
digest and utilize the various sugar substrates tested. (cf.
GALLI and GIESE, 1959) Until the presence of enzymes in the
gut wall of C. spirabrancha is demonstrated, the bacteria of
the annelid will remain a possible source of its carbohydrases.
