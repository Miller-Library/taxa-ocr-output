The least change in respiration due to osmotic stress
was found, in both hyper and hypoosmotic solutions,
at 8째0. Perhaps at this temperature the metabolism
is nearly minimal for maintenance, and the chiton
actively controls against further lowering.
In 100% sea water the Qjobetween 8째0 and 13.5째0 is
higher than that between 13.5째0 and 1900; this agrees
with many observations on other animals that Q0 decreases
with increasing temperature (Prosser, 1973). The
Qio's increase from the lowest salinity to the highest
for the colder temperature interval but remain quite
constant at the higher temperature interval (Table I).
Work should now be done to elucidate the physiological
processes responsible for this low temperature change
of 9jo with salinity.
SUMMARY
1. Mopalia lignosa respire at a higher rate as the
temperature increases.
2. Deviation in salinity from normal sea water causes
a decrease in respiration rate.
3. At low, but not higher; temperatures, the 910
increases with salinity.
