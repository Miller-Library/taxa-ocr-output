INTRODUCTION
The chiton Mopalia lignosa (Gould, 1848) is a common
inhabitant of the inter-tidal zone on Californian shores.
Although it usually retreats to sheltered regions during
the day and at low tide, it must be able to cope with
relatively wide variations in temperature and salinity,
both on a seasonal basis and during a single tidal cycle.
Temperature and salinity in the environment do not necessarily
fluctuate together. In winters, for example, animals may
experience relatively high salinities and low temperatures
when submerged, and low salinities and low temperatures
during rains at low tide.
Studies of the combined effects of temperature and salinity
on metabolic rates have been carried out on such marine
organism as the crabs Hemigrapsus oregonensis Dana, 1851)
and H. nudus (Dana, 1851) by Dehnel (1960), and the gill
tissues of oysters and mussels by Van Winkle (1968).
However, no studies of this sort have been made on chitons.
I here report the effects of simultaneously imposed
temperature and salinity variations on the respiratory
rate of M. lignosa. All studies were carried out at the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific
Grove, California, during the period April-June, 1974.
The chitons used in the experiments were collected at various
points on the rocky shores of the Monterey Peninsula.
