MATERIALS AND METHODS
Respiration rates were measured using Warburg-
Barcroft manometers kept in a water bath held at a
constant temperature. A wick of filter paper wetted
with 0.2 ml of 10% KOH was placed in the side arm
of the respiration chamber in order to absorb C0», and
the vessels were agitated. The vessel constants were
measured using a Gilmont-Warburg calibrator.
Salinities were obtained by dissolving "Instant
Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt" (Aquarium Systems, Inc.).
in appropriate amounts of distilled water and were
checked with a salinometer. Normal sea water from
the environment (100%) was determined to be 33.91%.
Animals taken from the field were held in running
sea water at 13.510.5°0 for at least three days
before use. I assumed the relation between respiratory
rate (Vo2) and body weight (W) followed the equation;
Voz-Kw0.74 where K is a constant. The value 0.74
is the generalized value for animals given by Prosser (1973)
and is close to the average value (0.73) found by
Kincannon (1974) for the chiton Tonicella Lineata
(Wood, 1815).
Using the above equation, the measured respiratory
rates were corrected to that of a hypothetical ten
gram chiton. The weight of the animals varied from
5.5-18.5 grams. Sample size varied from three to
six animals at each temperature salinity combination.
