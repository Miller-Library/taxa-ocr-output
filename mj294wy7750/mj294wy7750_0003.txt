Individual chitons were placed in separate Warburg
vessels and covered with seventy ml of synthe tic
sea water at the salinity to be tested. They equilibrated
for one hour at a given temperature. Readingswere
then taken hourly for six hours. The average number
of ul of 0 consumed/gram/hour was taken as the
respiratory rate. Each of the three temperatures
within the environmental range encountered by M. lignosa
(800, 13.500, and 19°0) was combined with four different
salinities (90%,100%, 110%, and 120% of normal sea water)
to yield separate experimental conditions.
Kincannon (1974) has shown that there is not
conspicuous diurnal rythm in regards to chiton respiration.
thus experimental runs were made at various times during
a day.
RESULTS
Respiration rates vs. temperature for the four
salinities are shown in Figure 1. Their 010 values
are listed in Table 1. Like most poikilotherms.
chitons respire at an increased rate at higher temperatures:

36.2 ul at 100% sea water and 190C ys. 14.27 ul at
100% sea water and 800. The 010 value calculated
using the 13.5°0 and values for animals in 1906 and 100 %
sea water is 2.0. However, using the 80C and 13.50C values.
a much higher 910 of 2.7 is obtained for the same animals.
