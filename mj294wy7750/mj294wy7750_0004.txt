Respiration as a function of salinity for each
experimental temperature is plotted in Figure 2.
For each temperature, animals in 100% SW respired at a
significantly higher rate than at any other salinity.
DISCUSSION
Most marine molluscs are osmoconformers with
varying degrees of stenohalinity (Prosser, 1973).
Kinne (1971), states that although not much is known
on how salinity affects invertebrate metabolism,
there are some general trends in the responses of
species. One of these trends is that animals which
are stenohaline decrease respiration at both the
higher and lower salinites. This reduction in respiratory
rate may be mediated through any of the following
routes: (1) increasing or decreasing the body water
or salt content; (2) changing of internal ion ratios;
(3) hormonal, neuromuscular, and enzymatic interference
and (4) behavioral changes (Kinne, 1971). In addition
there is probably a reduction in the concentration
of cellular metabolites in animals placed in hypotonic
solutions, and a reduction of oxygen tension in those
exposed to hypertonic media, both of which could lower
respiratory rate.
