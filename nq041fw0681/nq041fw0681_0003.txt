INTRODUCTION
The skin of the common market squid, Loligo opalescens is
capable of rapid changes in both color and pattern. These changes are
effected through the action of two cell types, chromatophores and
iridophores. Together, chromatophores and iridophores allow the
squid to camouflage themselves from predators and to signal to othe
members of the species. The most spectacular displays of color are
produced by the iridescent iridophore cells, which may reflect light in
metallic hues of pink, green, blue, orange and yellow.
The organization of color producing cells into units and patterns
has been well described. (Hanlon,1982). Iridophores appear in two
basic arrangements, dorsal splotches and ventral sheets. The dorsal
splotches are arranged as rings, which our lab has fondly nicknamed
doughnuts", and contain a number of iridophore cells with a
chromatophore in the center. The ventral sheets are a more ordered
array of iridophore cells, arranged as continuous sheets of color.
Iridescent cells known as reflector cells cover the optic lobes, ink sacs
and various internal organs of the squid.
Both reflector cells and iridophore cells are characterized by
non-pigmented arrays of thin membrane bound platelets. In both
cell types, these platelets are of a higher refractive indexs than the
material around them, and reflect light to produce structural colors.
The basic difference between reflector cells and iridophores is in the
orientation of the platelets. In iridophores the platlets are oriented on
edge relative ot the skin surface, while in reflector cells they are flat
with a broad surface facing out (Brocco & Cloney, 1980). It is thought
