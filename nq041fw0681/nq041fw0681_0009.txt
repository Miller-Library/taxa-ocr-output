stimulation.
Another possibility is that the iridophores are electrically
coupled. That is, that all of the iridophores in a single doughnut are
directly connected by gap junctions. Because an assay for gap proteins
was not performed, this possibility can not be discounted. However,
the activation of peripheral iridophores, as far away as in an adjacent
ring, seems to weaken the possibility of the existance of gap junctions.
A third and more likely explanation for the activation of
iridophores through electrical stimulation is that the iridophores are
all connected through a fine network of nerves. The fact that a higher
frequency of stimulation increases the spread of iridophore activation
suggests that some kind of facilitated activation is talking place. The
high frequency of stimulation may build upon action potentials, thus
allowing them to traverse several synapses to activate a large number
of iridophore cells within the network.
The possible innervation of iridophore cells is also supported
through the preliminary results of stimulation experiments in several
different bath applied solutions (see results Table 1). Sodium is
needed to carry action potentials along nerves, thus the failure of the
spread of iridescence in zero sodium, as well as a partial blockage of
spread in TTX, implies that nerve function may be hindered. This
result is strengthened by iridophore failure in zero calcium solution,
as calcuim is also quite necessary for nor mal nerve transmission.
Magnesium blocks calcium channels at neural synapses, thus a high
magnesium solution would block the efficacy of synaptic transmission.
Scopolamine, working as an ACh antagonist also blocked the spread of
