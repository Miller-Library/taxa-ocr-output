about 2.5mm, and often caused the activation of iridescence to
spread to adjacent rings up to almost Smm away. Once it was
established that electrical stimulation was possible in activating
iridophores, various solutions were applied to the mantle
preperations, with results illustrated in Table 1.
Video tapes taken of the stimulation of iridophores in different
solutions were then analysed on the Image analyser. Images of the
iridophores at differents times during the activation process were
projected upon the screen. The image was mapped, and the
percentages of white pixels in each picture represented the area of
iridophore activation. The results from such analysis of both contross
(in natural sea water) and of experimental preperations in high Mg-
and Scopolamine can be seen in figure 1 and figure2.
The actual time of activation through electrical stimulation of the
iridophores ranged between 10 and 60 seconds, with a peak intensity
appearing between 30 and50 seconds. The deactivation of the
iridophores was much longer and more varied, ranging between 5
and 30 minutes while under running sea water.
It was observed that during activation the iridophores passed
through various stages of color, intensity and density. Upon initial
stimulation the iridophores often began iridescing yellow and blue,
later turning to the more common pink and red stage. The spread of
iridescence did not appear to occur in concentric circles about the
electrode tip. Rather, it occured randomly within a ring, with a few
iridophores in various locations activating, to later be joined by others
between them, thus increasing the density of activated within a
