that iridophores produce structural colors by acting either as a thin
film interference device or as a diffraction grating. (Brocco & Cloney,
1980; Land,1972). The basic difference between iridophores that
are in a non-iridescent and those in an iridescent state is in the
ultrastructure of the platelets, which coalesce from a non uniform to
highly structured material of uniform refractive index (Cooper &
Hanlon, 1986).
It has been reported that the pigmented chromatophore organs
are under neural control. (Cloney & Florey, 1968; Mirow,1972; Cloney
& Brocco, 1983). However, little is known about the control of
iridophore cells. Previous investigation has shown the
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) to be a key factor in the
activation of structural changes in iridophore cells. Although ACh has
been found in the dorsal mantle iridophore der mal layer of L. brevis
at levels of 1 nmol Ach mg * protein, nothing has yet been deduced
about the delivery of the ACh to the cells, as the presence of nerves
has not yet been anatomically established (Cooper & Hanlon, 1986).
Several possible mechanisms for ACh delivery do exist. One is that the
ACh diffuses across a distance, originating in the chromatophore
layer. Another is that the ACh is delivered through the circulatory
system, acting almost as a hormone. A third possibility, also the
most likely, is that the iridophores are innervated by a very fine
nerve structure which releases ACh at its terminals. This paper sets
out to examine the possible mechanism of activation of the iridophore
cells, how the ACh is delivered, and to quantify the spread and
intensity of iridescence produced as iridophores are activated.
