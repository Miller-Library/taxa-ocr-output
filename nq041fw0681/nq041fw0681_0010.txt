iridophore activation. Therefore, the results of these preliminary
experiments suggest that nerves of some kind may possibly be
involved in the activation and spread of iridophore iridescence.
Examination of the time courses analysed on the image processor
show clearly that iridophore activation does not occur in concentric
circles, spreading away from the electrode. Rather, the iridophores
light up randomly with their density increasing as more and more are
activated. The image processed data also shows that most of the
iridophores show a similar time course of activity, with a peak
intensity of brightness reached about 30 to 50 seconds after
stimulation. It is interesting to note that those iridophores which are
brightest at first also seem to fade first.
In summary, the preliminary evidence presented here indicates
that the iridophore cells of squid L. opalescens could possibly be
under neural control, with a fine network of nerves present in the
third dermal layer. Thus, ACh could be delivered at these nerve
terminals, and not from a distance or through the circulation.
However, many experiments remain to be performed before any solid
conclusions about the presence of nerves in the third layer can be
made, the most obvious of which is a thorough anatomical search. A
great deal of analytical potential also lies in the use of the Mega Vision
Image Processor, which presents a good method of quantifying the
spread and intensity of iridescence. Overall, the study of the
activation of iridophore cells may lead to a better understanding not
only of squid behavioral color patterning, but also of the nervous
control of other ACh based systems.
