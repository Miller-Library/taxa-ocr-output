METHODS AND MATERIALS
Schooling L. opalescens caught locally in Monterey Bay were
kept in running sea water tanks. Both male and female squid were
used, with males being used more often because of their greater size.
Unless otherwise noted, skin preperations were made by first
decapitating the squid and then removing all of the internal organs,
including the gladius. The mantle was then pinned out, and the first
two dermal layers were peeled off. The remaining third layer,
containing the iridophores, was left on the mantle to prevent any
damage to possibly existing nerves. The preperation was periodically
run under natural seawater to retain its viability.
Circulatory experiments were run with the internal organs of the
squid intact. Glass microelectrodes were used to cannulate various
major arteries and viens, including the celiac arteries and cephasic
viens.
All experiments relating to neurophysiology were perfor med on
the common mantle preperation. Electrical stimulation was performed
through a fine glass suction electrode. Stimulation was carried out at
differing parameters: voltage ranged between 3V to 30V, frequency
of 1 to10Oper second, with duration 6 to 6ms However, the
parameters of 3V, 100 shocks per second, and 6 ms duration were
shown to be most effective and used for the majority of the
experiments. Results were observed through a Wild dissecting
microscope, and recorded on a VCR using a Hitachi Video Camera.
