DISCUSSION
The negative results of the circulatiory injection experiments,
coupled with the activation of iridiphores through electrical
stimulation lead one to believe that ACh is not carried through the
circulatory system to activate iridophore cells. This, in any event,
seemed unlikely from the start, as Ach is easily degraded in the
curculation, and if carried in the blood, would affect many other
organs besides the iridophores.
It is also clear that ACh is not only delivered as a secondary
response to chromatophore activity. Direct observation of the squid
showed that the iridophores did not activate each time the
chromatophores expanded, and that their activation was selective to
the animals particular behavior.
There are several possible explanations for the fact that electrical
stimulation activates iridophores. One possivility is that voltage gated
channels are being opened due to the voltage change caused by the
shock. Although this may account for the activation of iridiphores
directly beneath the electrode, it in no way explains the iridescence
produced in peripheral iridophores, far from the area of direct
