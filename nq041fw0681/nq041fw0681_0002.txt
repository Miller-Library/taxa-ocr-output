ABSTRACT
The squid Loligo opalescens exhibits iridescent colors in its
third der mal layer through the action of a specific cell type, the
iridophore. Although much is known about the neural control of the
squids pigmented chromatophore organs, little is known about the
action of iridophore cells, other than the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine is responsible for their activation. This paper sets out to
examine the possible mechanism of ACh delivery to the iridophore
cells, through an analysis of the activation and spread of iridescence
in response to electrical stimulation.
