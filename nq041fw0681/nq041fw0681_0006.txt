Mantle preperations were immersed in 50 ml bathes of various agents
to test for the activation of iridophores by electrical stimulation. The
solutions were in concentrations as follows: TTX - 1x10*° in natural
sea water; high Ca' - natural sea water + 50 mM Cacl»; high Zn'-
natural sea water + 10mM ZnCl; 0 Na’- Tris replaced Na’ in
artificial sea water; 0 Ca’- 0 Ca' artificial sea water; high Mg' -
60mM MgCl, in artifiial sea water; Scopolamine - 1x10 4 in natural
sea water. Quantitative analysis of video taped data was performed
on a Mega Vision Image Processor.
RESULTS
Injecting ACh into the circulatory system of the squid resulted in
no change in the status of the iridophores, or even of the
chromatophores. Varying concentrations of 1x10-7, 1x10-6, 1x10-4
were all tried. Neither injections into the major arteried nor into the
major viens proved effective in activating the iridophores to produce
iridescence. Bath applied ACh at a concentration of 1x10-6 after
negative injection results did activate the iridophores, thus the skin of
the preperations was still viable.
Direct electrical stimulation of the third dermal layer of skin
proved to be much more fruitful. A single shock of 7.5V or greater
produced iridescence in a single, or a few iridophores. Multiple shocks
of 3V at a frequency of 100 per second for 1 to 5 seconds activated
large numbers of iridophores in a single doughnut, with a ring size of
