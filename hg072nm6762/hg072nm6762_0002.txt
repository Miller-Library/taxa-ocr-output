State of California. "Cease and Desist" orders were is-
sued by the Regional Water Quality Control Board to
the city of Pacific Grove and other communities, and
later a ban was placed on further sewer connections.
Some time after the closing of the beaches, the Paci-
fic Grove sewage treatment plant stepped up its chlo-
rination in an effort to bring down coliform levels,
producing levels of residual chlorine up to at least
45 ppm and an extension of the visibly damaged area
around the outfall on Point Pinos by April 1970.
A preliminary survey showed hermit crabs to be
absent in the area. In subsequent studies, the distri-
bution of Pagurus genus was determined, the toxicity
of chlorinated and unchlorinated sewage to hermit crabs
was studied in both laboraory and field, and the ten-
dency of hermit crabs to move away from various con-
centrations of sewage in the laboratory was measured.
Outside of the distribution study, only P. samuelis
was used due to its more ready availability.

the sewage outfall.
Anquantitative study of the distribution of Pa-
