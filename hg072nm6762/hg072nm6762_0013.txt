given in Fig. 4 (compare with mortality in field cages,
Fig. 3). The only solutions below 50% concentration
showing mortality significantly greater than the con-
trol (8% in 29 days) were 20% and 10% Pacific Grove
chlorinated sewage. The duplicate runs in 100% concen-
trations showed virtually identical rates of death. All
three size classes showed very similar mortality rates
in toxic solutions.
Appendages of individuals killed in high con-
centrations (100%,50%,20%) of chlorinated sewage were
constricted, whereas in 10% chlorinated sewage and all
other types of toxic solutions, the appendages at death
were relaxed. When high mortality occurred in solutions
with LT 50's greater than 100 hours, the bristles on
the appendages were whitened, extended, and prominent,
with much adhering particulate material. Death in so-
lutions with mortality in the range of the control ap
parently resulted from predation, although the actual
act was never observed; a half-eaten body, a few appen-
dages, or an empty shell provided evidence of the
cause of death here. Never was a crab found just sit-
ting dead in its shell in non-toxic solutions, and
very seldom were half-eaten crabs found in toxic so-
lutions. No interest in food was shown in solutions
with LT 50's under 30 hours.
From the laboratory studies it can be seen that
chlorine is the most toxic component of sewage, since
