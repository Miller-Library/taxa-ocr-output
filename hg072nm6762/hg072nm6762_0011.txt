sodium thiosulfate, Na2S203, to determine if chlorine
was a toxic factor; 0.36 g of thiosulfate were added
for each liter of sewageiin the solution. Thisiwas
enough to neutralize approximately 100 ppm chlorine,
more than twice the amount ever detected in the sewage.
(c) a control for (b) alone using sea water and
sodium thiosulfate at 0.36 g/liter, the highest concen-
tration in any solution, to determine if thiosulfate
itself could be toxic.
(d) 100% Pacific Grove sewage dechlorinated
with O.36 g/liter thiosulfate and raised to the salin-
ity of sea water by adding 33.5 grams of "Instant
Ocean" salts per liter of sewage.
(e) unchlorinated sewage from the treatment
plant of the adjacent city of Monterey in concentrations
of 100%,50%,20%,10%, and 1% to compare the relative
toxicities of sewage from the two areas.
(f) distilled water at concentrations of 100%,
50%,20%,10%, and 1% for an osmotic control.
(g) tap water at 100% concentration. Tap water
is closer to the salinity ofsewage than distilled water.
(h) 100% sea water control.
Two tests instead of one were meade for each 100g
solution showing toxicity (50 animals). The larger
dishes (40 animals) were used for all 50% concentrations.
All dilutions were made using sea water from
