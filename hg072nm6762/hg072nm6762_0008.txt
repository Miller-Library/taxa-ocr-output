situated in a high tidepool (13 feet in tidal height)
rather than below 0.0; polluted water is thus trapped
here for longer periods of time than at lower levels.
The field cage study shows that any P. samuelis
within a 100 foot radius of the outfall were killed
but beyond 110 feet there were no lethal effects in
four weeks. This correlates with the distribution
study, which showed no P. samuelis within the 100 foot
radius. A high mortality did occur in cage 6, where
large numbers of living P. granosimanus and P. hirsu-
tiusculus were found; however, the living crabs were
concentrated at the end of the pool farthest from the
outfall, and the cage was at the nearest end, where few
living Pagurus were found. Field observations show that
murky water from the outfall begins to seep into the
pool as the tide rises to about 1.0 ft. in tidal height;
thereafter it is flushed out with clean water from the
opposite direction as the tide reaches about 13.0 ft.,
and heavily polluted water is not concentrated in the
far half of the pool.
In a similar field cage study conducted by the
author in August 1969, no significant mortality occurred
in any cages within the 100 foot radius in 12 days. The
closest cage to the outfall was 15 feet away. This was
before heavy chlorination, thus implicating chlorine
as the factor producing high mortality in May 1970.
