Areas with suitable Pagurus habitat (pools
which do not drain even at lowest tides) were deli-
neated. Relative abundance of Pagurus in each area
was scored as follows (see Fig. 1): abundant (over 100
individuals per transect or 10 m2); fairly common (20-
99 per transect or 10m2); scarce (less than 20 per
transect or 10-m2); absent (no individuals eseened)
Areas where no transects were taken were examined qua-
litatively.
Location of transects and totals for each species
and size class for the transects are given in Appendix
A; areas containing suitable habitat and the relative
abundance of the genus in each area is given in Fig. 1.
No alterations in the pattern of distribution were ob-
served where the genus was present: in areas below
+1.0 feet in tidal height, large P. granosimanus and
small P. hirsutiusculus were by far the most common,
and above t1.0 feet, P. samuelis was the only species
found, with all three size classes being common. The
general distribution of the genus in relation to tidal
height and the relative abundance of the size classes
conformed to that found by Belknap and Markham (1965).
In only two areas was Pagurus abundant, and in
most areas the genus was classified as scarce. Pagurus
was absent within about a 100 foot radius of the out
fall, although the abundance of pools within this area
would normally make it highly suitable for Pagurus. Al.
