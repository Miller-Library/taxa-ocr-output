Acknowledgments
These investigations were supported in part
by the National Science Foundation Undergraduate Re-
search Program, Grant no. GY-7288. I wish to thank Dr.
Donald P. Abbott for his help and suggetsions during
the experiments and his invaluable criticism of the
manuscript. I would like to thank James Schreiber for
making his chlorine testing apparatus available to me.
Elaine Anselmo provided chlorine data from the outfall
area, and Victor Anderlini, Elaine Anselmo, Dave Clear-
man, John Hainsworth, Marshall Holstrom, and Tom Rot-
kis cooperated with me in obtaining chemical data at
Point Pinos. Marshall Holstrom provided the Pollicipes
used for food.
