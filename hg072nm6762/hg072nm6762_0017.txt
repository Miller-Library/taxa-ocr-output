IV. Movement of P. samuelis away from sewage
It was hypothesized that the absence of P. sa-
muelis in the outfall area might be accounted for by
movement of the animals away from the outfall, and so
an experiment was devised to measure movement out of
various concentrations of sewage.
Plastic boxes l0cm by 10 cm and 6 cm deep were
clamped togehter in pairs joined by a strip of plastic
screening extending from the floor of one box to the
floor of the other. The hermit crabs could thus easily
climb out of one dish and into the other, using the
screen as ladder and bridge. The boxes were filled with
test solutions to within 5 mm of the top (about 500 ml).
Each pair of boxes contained sea water in one and test
solution in the other. Controls were run with sea water
in both boxes. The sewage was brought to sea water
temperature before use (from about 18°c to 14°c).
During the experiments the solutions warmed gradually
to about 16°0. No aeration was used.
The following solutions were tested, each at
100%,50%,20%,10%,and 1% concentrations: (1) unchlori-
nated Pacific Grove sewage, (2) unchlorinated Pacific
Grove sewage raised to sea water salinity by adding
33.5 g "Instant Ocean" salts per liter sewage, and
(3) tap water for an osmotic control.
