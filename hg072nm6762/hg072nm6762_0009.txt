III. Laboratory studies on the toxicity of sewage to
Pagurus samuelis.
Experiments to determine the short-term tox-
icity of sewage to P. samuelis in the laboratory were
carried out as follows:
In each test 25 P. samuelis (5 large, 10 medium,
and 10 small) were placed in shallow plastic dishes
each with a bottom area of about 600 cm2. This is the
approximate density calculated by Richardson (1965) to
give less than 20% mortality in 5 days (25 aniamls per
525 cm), although only 8% mortality in 29 days occurred
in controls in this experiment. Occasionally larger
dishes with a bottom area of 1000 cm were used, and
the number of individuals in these dishes was raised
to 40 to acheive the same density. The animals never
utilized all the area available to them, clustering
in the corners most of the time; thus crowding was not
thought to be a critical factor. Each group of animals
was given a 24 hour acclimation period in fresh sea
water before antest, since Richardson (1965) states
that most mortality-producing interactions occur in
the first four hours. In 25 experiments, however, only
2 out of 705 hermit crabs were found dead after the ac-
climation period.
