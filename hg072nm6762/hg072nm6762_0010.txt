Fifteen-hundred ml of solution were added to
the smaller dishes and 2000 ml to the larger ones, gi-
ving a depth of about 1.5 inches, in which the animals
were continuously submerged. No aeration other than
diffusion was used since the surface to volume ratio
was large. Dishes were placed in a circulating sea
water bath to maintain a constant temperature of about
14°. This is slightly higher than the average sea
water temperature during May in Monterey Bay (12°0),
but is well within the temperature ranges if the high
tidepools in which P. samuelis abounds, and is well
below thermal death point for P. samuelis (31.500;
Forward, 1965).
The following solutions were tested:
(a) chlorinated Pacific Grove sewage at con-
centrations of 100%,50%,20%,10%, and 1%. Chlorine
levels in straight sewage ranged from 15 to 45 ppm
as determined by idiometric titration as given in
Standard Methods for the Examination of Waste and
Wastewater,1966. Residual chlorine levels were found
to drop by about 25% after 6 hours after arrival from
the sewage plant. No chlorine was ever detected in the
1% concentration, but the assay was not sensitive in
the levelseexpected at that concentration.
(b) Pacific Grove sewage at concentrations of
100%, 50%, 20%, 10%, and 1%, but dechlorinated with
