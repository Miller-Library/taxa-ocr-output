ference was shown between 1% Pacific Grove chlorinated
sewage and sea water.
In the movement experiments, a solution was con-
sidered to produce movement away from it if the ratio
of individuals in the sea water box to those in the
test solution after one hour was greater than 2:1. The
three controls averaged 1.2 : 1, fairly close to the
l:l ratio expected by chance alone. On this criterion,
movement shown seems to be related mainly to reduc-
tion in salinity; sewage and tap water dilutions
showed approximately the same ratios, but sewage so-
lutions adjusted to sea water salinity by addition of
sea salts produced no movement except in 100% concen-
tration. Movement away from 100%, 50%, and 20% so-
lutions of both sewage and tap water was recorded,
but not at 10% and 1% concentrations. If movement away
from an area is responsible for the absence of P. sa-
muelis there, the experiments suggest the animals move
cif the salinity is at or below 2700/00, but nothif higher
than about 30 0/00. Since salinities measured were
lowerr√∂than 30 0/00 in the field only within a 25 foot
radius of the outfall, it seems likely that the absence
of P. samuelis within a 100 foot radius is not due
solely to movement away from the pipe.
