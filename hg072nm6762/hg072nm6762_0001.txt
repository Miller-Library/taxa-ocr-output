Introduction
Little is known of the effects of sewage on ma-
rine organisms. This study attempts to measure some of
the effects on the intertidal hermit crab Pagurus sam-
uelis (Stimpson, 1859).
Field studies were conducted at the sewer out-
fall on the southwest side of Point Pinos, Pacific
Grove, California. The city of Pacific Grove (pop.
14,000) dumps into the ocean approximately 14 million
gallons of primary-treated sewage per day. The outfall
is located about 0.5 feet above Mean Lower Low Water
in an area which receives heavy wave action. The sew-
age is composed mainly of suburban household wastes,
and contains almost no industrial or agricultural
wastes. Primary treatment removes grease, oil, and
other floatables, and allows some settlement of solids;
the treatment plant includes a digester which uses bac-
terial action to break down some organic material, obut
this was not operating effectively during the study
period.
Considerable controversy occurred in the fall
of 1969 concerning the quality of sewage treament by
Pacific Grove and other Monterey Bay communities. The
Monterey County Board of Health ordered the closing
of many beaches around Monterey Bay in September 1969
when counts showed coliform bacteria levels exceeding
