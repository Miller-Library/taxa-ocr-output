chlorinated sewage was the only solution tested which
caused significant mortality in concentrations below
50%. When chlorine was neutralized with thiosulfate,
no significant mortality occurred in concentrations
below 50%.
Fresh water also contributes to the toxicity
of sewage, for when dechlorinated Pacific Grove sewage
was raised to the salinity of sea water, its LT 50 in
creased from 13 hours to 27. Also, significant mortal-
ity occurred in 100% and 50% distilled water and 100%
tap water (see Figs. 5 & 6). Unfortunately tap water
concentrations below 100% were not tested, but the
LT 50 for pure tap water (18 hrs.) was significantly
higher than that for pure distilled water (10 hrs.),
which has a lower salt content.
While both chlorine and fresh water are toxic
components of sewage, there are still other toxic
factors, since when the chlorine was removed and the
salinity raised, mortality still occurred, although
at a lower rate. Also, distilled water proved much
less toxic at 50% concentration than the same concen-
tration of dechlorinated sewage.
Since in laboratory experiments sewage solutions
were changed once a day, the situation here differs
somewhat from that in the field: near the outfall at
high tides fresh sewage is added continuously to the
