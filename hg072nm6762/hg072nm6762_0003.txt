species, P. samuelis, P. granosimanus, (Stimpson, 1859),
P. hemphillii (Benedict, 1892), and P. hirsutiusculus
(Dana, 1851), was determined.
Twenty-eight one meter wide transects were ex-
amined at low tide at various locations on Point Pinos.
Each transect was approximately 10 meters long, begin-
ning at the low water level of the ocean at the time
-1.0 to 0.0 feet in tidal height). Every hermit crab
as it was found was scored as to (1) species, and (2)
approximate size, using the width of the base of the
shell (always of the turban snail Tegula in adults) as
a rough measure of the size of the individual. Adults
were identified using Light's manual (Light, Smith,
Pitelka, Abbott, and Weesner 1964), and juveniles using
Putnam and Markham's key (Putnam and Markham, 1965).
Populations in three large tidepools were considered
as separate units. For each transect or large pool, the
following were determined: (a) the total number of Pa-
gurus, (b) the total number of each species, and (c)
the total number in each size-class for each species.
Three size-classes were defined: large (shell base
width greater than or equal to 20 mm; carapace width
greater than 7.5 mm); medium (shell base width 10 to
19 mm; carapace width 2.5 to 7.5 mm); and small (shell
base width less than 10 mm; carapace width less than
2.5 mm).
