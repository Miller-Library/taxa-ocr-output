the sea water system at Hopkins Marine Station. One
or two gooseneck barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus) were
fed to each group once a week. Uneaten portions were
removed after 18 hours to prevent fouling of the water.
As mentioned above, food was not considered a critical
factor in mortality (Richardson, 1965). Fresh sewage was
obtained every morning from the Pacific Grove, and
Monterey sewage plants, and test solutions were
changed within 2 hours thereafter. Solutions not con-
taining sewage were also changed daily.
Each test solution was examined at intervals
determined by the relative toxicities of the solutions,
i.e. hourly if highly toxic or twice daily if no rapid
mortality observed. Criteria of death were as follows.
Individuals showing no response to prodding were re-
moved and placed in fresh sea water; if after 15 mi-
nutes there was no response to prodding and if the
mouth parts were not moving, the individual was con-
sidered dead. Often individuals showing no response in
the test solution showed limited movement of appendages
within 5 minutes exposure to fresh sea water; but twice
about 10 animals scored as dead were left for twelve
hours in fresh sea water without recovering.
The percentages of surviving animals versus
time for 100% and 50% solutions appears in Figs 5 & 6.
