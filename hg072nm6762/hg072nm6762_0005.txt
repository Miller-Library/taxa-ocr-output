gal coveri is greatly reduced or lacking within this
100 foot radius. Pagurus was also absent in two areas
of Cove A. Areas where hermit crabs were abundant or
fairly common were as close to the outfall as 120 feet,
just outside the area where they were absent.
The heterogeneity of the intertidal makes it
difficult to say much more about the distribution of
Pagurus at Point Pinos than that they were absent
within a 100 foot radius from the outfall, and that Pa-
gurus isgenerally not very common at Point Pinos. In
no area was the density of Pagurus as high as that found
at Mussel Point approximately two miles southeast of
Point Pinos.
