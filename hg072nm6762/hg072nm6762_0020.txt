Summary
1. Pagurus is absent within a 100 foot radius of the
Pacific Grove sewage outfall. No abnormalities in
the patterns of distribution of Pagurus were found
outside the 100 foot radius.
2. Field cages containing P. samuelis placed within a
100 foot radius of the outfall showed 100% mor
tality in 28 days. Beyond this distance, mortalities
did not exceed those in unpolluted areas.
3. Chlorinated sewage (residual chlorine 15 - 45 ppm)
was the only one of several solutions tested in the
laboratory (including dechlorinated sewage) showing
significant mortality in 20% and 10% concentrations.
Chlorine was probably the cause of deaths recorded
in field cages within 100 feet of the outfall; lab-
oratory studies showed sewage without chlorine could
not account for this mortality except in concentra-
above 50%.
4. Fresh water is a component of sewage toxic to P. sa-
muelis at salinities of 0 - 17 0/00, but not toxic
at 27 0/00 and above in115 days.
5. Other toxic components are present in sewage since
mortality exceeding that of controls was recorded in
sewage which was dechlorinated and osmotically bal-
anced.
