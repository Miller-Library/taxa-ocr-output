Abstract
Background
Symbiotic bacteria inhabit the accessory nidamental gland of the squid, Loligo opalescens, and are
transmitted vertically to its egg cases. Previous work has resulted in the cultivation, isolation, and
characterization of two dominant bacterial strains (genera Shewanella and Roseobacter) from
homogenates of egg case sheath and accessory nidamental gland.
Questions
Do these cultivated isolates accurately represent the diversity of the sheath bacterial community?
Are there bacteria present in the sheaths that are not cultivatable and therefore have not been
described or characterized? What are the numbers of bacteria in the sheaths and what percent of
these can be cultured?
Results
In order to obtain release of the bacteria from the sheath for quantitative enuneration, a means of
disrupting the the tough egg sheath was developed using sodium periodate and glass beads. Total
bacterial counts ranged between 10° and 10' bacteria per sheath which is slightly higher than the
10° to 10° estimated by Biggs and Epel (1991) with electron microscopy. A live/dead staining
assay with DAPI and propidium iodide indicated about 68% of bacteria in sheath homogenate were
alive. Serial dilutions of the native sheath homogenate were plated on various culture media and
colony forming units were counted. Using comparison of direct bacterial counts from the
homogenate, the viability stain, and the number of colony forming units on plates, the percent of
bacteria cultivatable was found to be between 30 and 50%.
Conclusions
Because a significant portion of the bacteria were not cultivatable, further investigation of egg
sheath bacteria may be necessary to adequately describe its diversity and composition.
