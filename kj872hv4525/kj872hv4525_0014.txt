Figure Legend
Fig. 1 Intact egg case with incision line dotted (A). Egg sheath with middle third used for
homogenates shaded (B).
Fig. 2 Squid egg sheath bacterial counts from DAPI staining. Numbers are in numbers of bacteria
per sheath.
Fig. 3 Bacterial viability as determined by counts of sheath bacteria stained with DAPI and
propidium iodide. All cells stained with DAPI, while those stained with propidium iodide
were considered nonviable.
Fig. 4 Bacterial numbers from cultivation and direct counts. Numbers of cultivatable bacteria are
divided into identifiable colony types. Numbers of bacteria are expressed as the number
expected from the entire homogenate (containing two egg sheaths).
