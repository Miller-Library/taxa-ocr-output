Furthermore the fact that at least four of the carbon sources in the plates could not be used by either
the PKI or the WH2 isolates indicates that some component strains of the community may not
have been cultivated. One possibility for further study is to attempt to culture any such strains by
plating them from the Biolog wells that are unique to the sheath homogenates. A corollary is to
plate out directly from new sheath homogenate to culture plates with those carbon sources as the
only nutrients. This might allow the cultivation of any novel species capable of metabolizing these
carbon sources.
