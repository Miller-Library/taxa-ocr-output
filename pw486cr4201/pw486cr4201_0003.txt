Acmaea asmi (Middendorff, 1849) lives almost exclusively as a
commensal on the shell of Tequla funebralis (A. Adams, 1854). Pre-
vious workers found this association to be quite specific, A. asmi
preferring T. funebralis to Tegula brunnea (Philippi, 1848). Test
(1945) suggested that T. funebralis released a chemical attractant.
The source of this attractant was considered to be the shell by
Radford (1959), whereas, Eikenberry and Wickizer (1960) concluded
that both animal and shell were necessary. The following study
attempts to settle these differences and to provide further infor-
mation on behavioral and chemical aspects of this association.
Materials and Methods
Nost organisms used in this study were collected in inter-
tidal areas near Hopkins Marine Station, except for Tegula brunnea
Crmel Bag, Calig.
which was collected in the Pebble Beach area, All experiments were
run over night in pyrex dishes kept at 12-13Â°C in a darkroom.
Preliminary experiments showed that if no choice were offered,
Acmaea asmi would climb onto any shells tested. Therefore, to
measure relative preferences, the limpets were allowed to choose
between two different substrates. In the test five limpets were
placed in about two om of water in the center of a 24 cm pyrex pie
plate. Ten test shells were placed equidistantly around the periphery
of the plate. There were five of each type to be compared, and they
were placed alternately in the sircle.
To permit washing of the Tequla shells with various solvents,
the operculum was sealed with canning wax (Parowax). The animals
survived this sealing treatment, and most importantly, were apparently
