unaffected by such solvents as alcohol or distilled water.
In all experiments the dishes were then placed overnight in
a darkroom at 12-13eC, and the number of limpets on the test shells
determined the following morning.
Results and Dissussion
Rodford (1959) found that the shells of Tequla funebralis were
not preferred by Acmaea asmi if the shells were boiled in alcohol
for 15 minutes. The results shown in Figure lA indicate that simple
room-temperature washing in ethanol for one hour also removes any
attractant on the shell. In this experiment the limpets were given
a choice between parowax-sealed shells washed in alcohol and control
parowax-sealed shells. In five trials (25 limpets) the control
shells attracted 90% of the limpets, while the alcohol-washed shells
attracted ten per cent.
The attractant is also partially removed by distilled water.
If sealed shells containing Tequla funebralis are washed for two
hours in distilled water and compared with normal, sealed shells,
only 253 are found on the washed shells versus 65% on the control
shells (rig. 18). (Where the total percentage does not equal 1007,
the difference represents those animals not found on any shell.)
However, distilled water washing is not as effective as alcohol
washing. As seen in Fig. 1C, 60% of the animals preferred the
water-washed shells as compared to only 15% on the alcohol washed.
Although A. asmi is rarely found on Tequla funebralis shells
inhabited by Paqurus spp., the limpets do not discriminate between
these two types of shells. Thus, using the usual test system.
