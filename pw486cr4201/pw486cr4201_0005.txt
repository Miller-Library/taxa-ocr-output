equal numbers of limpets were found on sealed T. funebralis shells
containing Paqurus spp. as on Parowax-sealed T. funebralis shells
containing its normal host (Fig. 10). Similar to normal shells,
the attraction of Paqurus-inhabitated shells is lost when treated
with alcohol (Fig. 1E).
A final preference test series was made with old uninhabited
Tequla shells found on the beach. Fig. Ir shows that Acmaea asmi
prefers normal inhabited shells to these old shells. However, as
shown in Fig. 16, treatment of normal shells with alcohol renders
them as unattractive as the old shells.
The above experiments suggest that the "attractant" is com-
pletely removed or destroyed by alcohol, and partially removed or
destroyed by distilled water. Furthermore, it is found on requla
shells inhabited by either T. funebralis or Pagurug spp., but is
not found on uninhabited shells found on the beach. The "attractant"
then, could be an alga or bacterial film associated with the shell,
ch is removed or destroyed by alcohol or distilled water.
However, the major algal epiphyte found on T. funebralis is also
found on the shells of Tequla brunnea and Acathina spirata (Eikenberry
and Wickizer, 1964), which are not the normal hosts for Acmaea asmi
Behavioral observations.
The above results on preference are consistent with a diffus
ible "attractant" emanating from the Tequla shell. Behavioral
observations, however, indicate that the preference might be made
at the tactile rather than olfactory or chemosensory level.
Continuous observations were made of the selection process in
