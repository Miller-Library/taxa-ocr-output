The behavioral basis of the association between Acmaea asmi
and Tequla funebralis has been investigated. The observations
indicate that A. asmi is not attracted by a diffusible substance,

critical substance(s) on the shell are easily destroyed or dis-
solved by ethanol and slightly removed by distilled water.
These factors are also present on Paqurus-inhabited Tequla
shells, but are not found on uninhabited shells found on the beach.
