a test situation where normal, sealed Tequla funebralis shells were
alternated with alcohol-treated ones.
As soon as the Acmaea asmi were placed in the center of the
Tequla funebralis circle, they extended their tentacles and began
to feel the substrate. These tentacles are thin and almost as long
as the shell when fully extended. They are moved in a tapping man-
ner from side to side as the animal crawls in a seemingly random
fashion across the bowl. When a specimen touched another A. asmi
with its tentacles, it felt the shell and then climbed immediately
onto it.
If a limpet crawled between two Tequla funebralis shells, one
alcohol-treated and the other not, it would tap each shell with its
tentacles and then, in every case observed (11), climb onto the unÂ¬
treated shell. If, however, the A. asmi encountered only one shell,
whether alcohol-treated or not, it would generally climb on. Once
on a shell, the A. asmi continued to move and sometimes changed
shells. Out of twenty-five animals tested, nine were at one time
or another on alcohol-treated shells. After eight hours, when the
experiment was concluded, only two limpets were still on these shells.
From these latter observations, it seems that Acmaea asmi is not
reacting to some diffusible chemical attractant from the shell, but
rather testing the substrates with its tentacles. It will crawl on
the first curved surface encountered, but if other choices are
available, will eventually end up on the preferred substrate. It
is interesting to note that Test stated that the diffusible attrac-
tant was sensed at seven mm and Radford felt the range to be ten mm.
If an A. asmi is placed this close to a T. funebralig, it can generally
