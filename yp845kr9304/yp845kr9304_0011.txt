1) Repeated stress results in higher levels of GC (than a single stress), which
ultimately translates into deleterious effects of GC over the long-term (Sapolsky,
1996).
This theory has recently fallen out of favor since a number of studies have shown that
severe, acute stress (such as PTSD), or sustained stress both result in equally high levels
of GCs (Sapolsky, 1996).
2) After repeated stress exposures, stress induced dendritic atrophy results in
irreversible remodeling of structural plasticity (Pham, 2003).
This theory is gaining support, largely because it allows for the possibility of one or many
additional regulators of neurogenesis, including GCs. Additionally, recent studies have
suggested a role for dendrites in regulation of neurogenesis (paper?). Moreover, while
GC levels decrease shortly after the final the stressor, other irreversible changes in
neuronal plasticity persist (Sapolsky et al, 1985).
Clearly, both of these theories have merit from extensive supporting background
research. However, the mechanism for molecular regulation of neurogenesis is not so
clearly differentiated and probably lies somewhere between the two theories discussed,
which is why it's not yet possible to determine how chronic, but not acute stress down-
regulates TeO neurogenesis in this experiment.
