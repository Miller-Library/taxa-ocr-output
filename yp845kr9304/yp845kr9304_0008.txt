Observation of CB slices showed stained nuclei throughout the entire image but at a
relatively higher density near the RV (Fig. 2A-F). The nuclei in tectal slices were in
relatively high-density clusters, generally near the tectal ventricle (Fig. 3A-C).
Acute Stress
Proliferation was examined by sacrificing the animals 2 hours after the BrdU
injection and viewing fluorescently stained nuclei under a confocal microscope. A single
4-hour predator stress exposure has no significant effect (P20.10) on the cell proliferation
rate in the examined regions of the zebrafish brain (Fig. 4). Two hours after BrdU
immersion, zebrafish exposed to predators exhibited the same mean cell number per slice
(100um-200um thick) as control fish. In the TeO, both control and experimental
zebrafish had similar numbers of cells clustered throughout. The control group cell
mean was 29.600 and the experimental group cell mean was 21.186 (t=1.132; P=0.1378;
df=15) (Fig. 4). A similar non-significant difference was seen in the CB. The control
mean cell number was 31.25 and the experimental group cell mean was 26.167(t=0.547;
P=.2996; df-8) (Fig. 4).
Chronic Stress
Proliferation was examined by confocal viewing of brain slices 1.5 hours after a
third BrdU injection. Chronic predator stress exposure of 4-hours per day for 3 days had
varying, region dependent effects on cell proliferation. In the TeO, chronic stress
resulted in a significant decrease in the number of BrdU-labeled nuclei per slice in adult
zebrafish. In the control group, the mean cell number was 39.538 (Fig. 5). In the
experimental group, a cell mean of 24.947 (Fig. 5) reflected a 36.7% decrease (Fig. 6) in
BrdU labeled cells (t=1.883; P-0.034; df-30). Generally, in the TeO, the density of and
