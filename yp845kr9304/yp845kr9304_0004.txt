proliferation (Gould et al., 2000). Exposure of zebrafish to a predator also appears be a
natural stressor that leads to elevation of cortisol-glucocorticoid levels for teleosts
(Kagawa, 2000; Kagawa and Mugiya, 2002). To determine whether predator exposure is
alters cell proliferation in the zebrafish brain we examined the numbers of proliferating
cells in the TeO and cerebellum (CB) of the zebrafish after single and multiple exposures
to predators.
Materials & Methods
Animal Treatments
Adult male zebrafish from the Thompson lab were used in the following
experiments. Albino oscar fish were obtained from the local aquarium supplier.
Zebrafish and oscars were acclimated separately to experimental conditions in 10 gallon
plastic tanks with filtration at 68°C. Throughout the acclimation period, fish were fed
pellet or flake food put on a LD 12:12. Fish were not fed on the day(s) of the experiment.
Stress Treatment Protocol
Acute Stress. Six zebrafish were acclimated in a single transparent tank with a mesh
divider, dividing them into 2 groups of 3 fish. The oscar fish were acclimated in an
identical tank, also able to be divided in half. Äfter 2 weeks of acclimation, at 10AM, 3
zebrafish were transferred from their home-tank into the identically divided oscar tank,
separated from the oscars by a mesh divider. The mesh divider allowed for the
circulation of water between both sides of the tank. Following 4 hours of exposure to the
oscars, the zebrafish were removed, placed into BrdU, and then sacrificed. The group of
3 zebrafish not exposed to the oscars was used as a control.
