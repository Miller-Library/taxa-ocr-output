Histology and Immunostaining
Following rehydration and dissection, for each brain, 100um-200um cross
sections through the entire brain were cut and bathed in 70% Hanks solution (Zebrafish
Book, Univ of Oregon). It was recorded what division of the brain, telencephalon
(forebrain), mesencephalon (optic tectum), or rhombencephalon (cerebellum) each cross
section was from. For fluorescent immuno-labeling, sections were placed onto well
containing slides, wash 2x in 2N HCl and then denatured at room temperature for 1 hour
in 2N HCl. The sections were then rinsed in 0.1% PBS-Tw and blocked in 5% Normal
Goat Serum + PBS-D-Tw + 1% BSA for 10 minutes. The sections were then rinsed
(PBS-Tw) and incubated overnight at room temperature in mouse monoclonal antibody
raised against BrdU (1:400 dilution in 5% NGS blocking solution, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). The sections were then rinsed several times and washed 4x, 15 minutes each in
PBS-D-Tw (1% DMSÖ + 0.1% Tween-20). Next, they were incubated in biotinylated
secondary antibody(exact name?) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 7-9 hours. Äfter several
rinses and 4x-15min washes in PBS-D-Tw, sections were individually mounted and
cover-slipped on glass slides in glycerol.
Data Collection
Sections on each slide were optically dissected along the Z axis into 2 um sections
using a Fluoview confocal microscope and software (Olympus). All of the images were
taken in grayscale at similar contrast-LUT settings, with a confocal aperture of 3 on a 40x
UPLFL dry lens. The regions of interest were the TeO, from the periventricular zone
(PVZ) to the outer edge (Fig 1A) and the CB, from the rostral ventricle (RV) to the outer
edge (Fig 1B). For purposes of comparison, images were taken around similar
