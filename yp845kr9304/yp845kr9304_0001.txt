Abstract
Exposure of teleost fish to predator stress has been shown to elevate plasma cortisol
levels. Consequently, we examined the effects of predator stress (albino oscars) on
neurogenesis in adult zebrafish. To find out how stress affects adult neurogenesis in the
zebrafish, we subjected zebrafish to acute or chronic predator stress and assessed the
proliferation of newly born cells in the optic tectum and cerebellum. These regions are
known to have measurable rates of cell proliferation. Stereologic analyses of the number
of 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled cells revealed that 1 exposure of zebrafish
to a predator (acute stress) did not change cell proliferation in the optic tectum or the
cerebellum. However, three day repeated predator stress (chronic stress) significantly
reduced cell proliferation, by 37% in the optic tectum, while having no significant effect
in the cerebellum. A comparison between non-stressed zebrafish optic tectum and
cerebellum revealed no significant regional difference in cell proliferation rate. These
findings suggest that stressful experiences may down-regulate adult neurogenesis in
certain regions of the zebrafish brain, similar to stress induced neurogenesis effects in
mammals and birds. This study presents the zebrafish as a unique new model for
understanding adult neurogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms.
