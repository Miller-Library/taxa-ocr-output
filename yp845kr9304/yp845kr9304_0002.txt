Introduction
Neurogenesis in the adult CNS is an intriguing phenomenon, both because of its
unexpected discovery by the scientific community and its implications for providing
insight into the cellular mechanisms and treatment of depression, PTSD, and other mood
disorders. Teleosts' potential to produce new neurons during adulthood in the central
nervous system was established decades ago (Rahmann, 1968; Johns, 1977; Meyer,
1978). This discovery came in parallel with studies on teleosts' unique ability to
regenerate axons after injury. Most of these investigations were conducted early on
before modern BrdU labeling of dividing cells, in the electric gymnotiform fish.
Around the same time, a number of major discoveries were made in the neurogenesis
field, causing most biologists to focus on non-fish neurogenesis models.
The first histological evidence of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus region of adult
rat hippocampi was found in 1965 and over the subsequent three decades, adult generated
neurons have become a major focus in stem cell and developmental biology,
pharmacology, and the study of mental illness (Altman and Das, 1965). Neurogenesis in
adult hippocampal cells has also been found in mice and humans, as well as a number of
non-human primates (Kempermann, 1997; Eriksson, 1998; Gould et al., 1997; Gould et
al., 1999). Rats and non-human primates, because of their pharmacological similarities to
humans, became the models of choice for studying neurogenesis and its regulation. In a
short period of time, regulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus was linked to
numerous stimuli: 1) It is up-regulated by exercise, an enriched environment, learning,
estrogen, and antidepressant drugs (RS Duman, 2001), and 2) It is down-regulated by
stress, glucocorticoids, age, opiates, and excitatory amino acids (Gould et al., 1999;
