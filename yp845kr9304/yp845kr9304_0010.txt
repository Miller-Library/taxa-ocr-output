Functional implications of effects of chronic predator stress on optic tectum
Three days of predator stress significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells in the
TeO, without changing the number of proliferating cells in the CB. However, increased
cortisol levels were measured in plasma of teleosts after predator stress, implying both
regions of the brain were exposed to the same elevated cortisol levels post stress (Kagawa
and Mugiya, 2002). If there is a glucocorticoid(GC)-neurogenesis link, as many previous
studies have suggested, a possible explanation for this observed regional difference is that
the TeO is a brain region of particularly high GC sensitivity (Sapolsky, 1996; Gould et
al., 2000). For example, the TeO may have a higher density of GC receptors or a higher-
affinity cortisol receptor as compared to the CB. Such richness in GC receptors would
make the TeO highly susceptible to insult-induced neuroendagerment. Another
compelling GC-related theory, different from the traditional steroid mechanism, stems
from recent studies that suggest glucocorticoids interact bi-directionally with a number of
enzymes, NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, and secondary hormones (IGF-1) during its
neuronal injury/endangerment cascade (Sapolsky, 1996; Aberg et al., 2000; Anderson et
al., 2002). These studies show that GCs are not always acting alone and on the contrary
may be regulating neurogenesis through a multi-leveled cascade. Moreover, it's possible
that an important receptor or signal in the cascade may be present in the TeO in
significantly higher density than in the CB.
Implications for the significant effects of chronic, but not acute stress
The two major schools in adult neurogenesis studies, the "glucocorticoid school" and
â€œthe dendritic-remodeling school" would make the following arguments in regard to
acute versus chronic stress effect differences:
