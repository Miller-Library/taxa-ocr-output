Gould et al., 2000; Malberg et al., 2000a; Duman et al., 2001). However, despite such
major discoveries, the molecular mechanisms behind neurogenesis and its regulation are
still largely unknown because the current model systems and techniques for studying
neurogenesis are logistically complicated and too insensitive.
In contrast, zebrafish are ideal for examining the phenomenon of adult
neurogenesis on the cellular and molecular levels. Generally, they are a prominent model
because of their short generation time, which has allowed them to become a common
model for genetic analyses, developmental embryology, and cell biology. In regards to
neurogenesis, much is already known about embryonic neurogenesis in zebrafish. Most
importantly, however, a number of excellent protocols for administering and labeling
BrdU in zebrafish have already been developed and it appears BrdU labeling is much less
complicated in zebrafish than in mammals. In mammals, one must administer BrdU via
intraperitoneal injection, while in zebrafish, it's possible to administer BrdU via the gills,
with adequate blood-brain barrier uptake (Byrd, 2001).
Previous stereologic studies have demonstrated that zebrafish produce several
thousand new neurons in the periventricular zone (PVZ) of the optic tectum (TeO), as
well as the olfactory bulb (Byrd, 2001; Mueller and Wullimann, 2002). Other studies
have shown that stress decreases cell proliferation in various cortical and neo-cortical
brain regions (Gould et al., 1997; Gould et al., 1999; Gould et al., 2000). The causative
factors for this stress induced change in cell proliferation are presently unknown, but
evidence has linked it to an adrenal steroid-dependent mechanism (Sapolsky, 1996). In
rats and tree shrews, exposure to predator odor is known to activate the hypothalamic-
pituaitary-adrenal axis, elevating glucocorticoids, in conjunction with decreasing cell
