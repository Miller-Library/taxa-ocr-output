total number of cell clusters increased with nearness to the PVZ and decreased toward the
tectal outer edge. In the CB, cells were clustered throughout relatively evenly with a
slight increase in cluster density near the RV.
Discussion
These findings demonstrate that repeated exposure to predatory oscar fish
decreases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the TeO of adult zebrafish (Fig. 5). The
decrease in labeled cells most likely reflects a decrease of adult CNS precursor cell
proliferation in the TeO. After only 3-days, there was already a 36.7% decrease in
proliferation of cells in TeO, an impressively large number attesting to the extremely
deleterious effects on cell proliferation of chronic perturbations. Although the
invertebrate zebrafish model and vertebrate model are obviously different, it's interesting
to note that similarly to the zebrafish model, a 40% decrease in cell proliferation was
induced when rats were exposed to predator odor (Tanapat et al., 2001). In contrast, such
chronic stress did not affect baseline proliferative activity in the CB, even though
significant levels of cell proliferation were and have been observed in this brain region
for teleosts (Zupanc and Horschke, 1995; Byrd, 2001; Zupanc, 2001). Acute, single
predator exposures of zebrafish to oscar predator fish appear not to have negative effects
on neurogenesis in either ROI examined in this experiment. While the observed cell
mean in the TeO and CB was lower after a single stress, the difference was not
statistically significant.
