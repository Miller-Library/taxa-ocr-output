morphological markers in each section. The general brain region, forebrain, midbrain, or
hindbrain was labeled during section slicing, but the specific brain section was identified
before image collection. To ensure unbiased counting, the digital images of regions of
interest were saved as extended views under a code number, which was not broken until
data analysis was complete.
Quantification of Cell Proliferation & Statistical Analysis
Total cell count for each coded image was manually quantified using Image-Pro
Plus (Silver Spring, Md) and strictly defined cell-criteria based on previous studies of
BrdU labeling of cells (Zupanc and Horschke, 1995; Byrd, 2001; Mueller and
Wullimann, 2002). Each slide was counted twice and an average cell number per slide
was used in statistical analysis. Ã„fter all slides were assigned cell counts, the code was
broken and total cell count between brain regions in stressed and non-stressed zebrafish
was compared using Student's t tests with one exception: because there were 3 different
brain regions of interest, two one-factor ANOVAs were used to examine cell number
differences between brain regions in controls and experimental fish separately. Because
of small sample size, analyses of the forebrain region were omitted and will be
considered in the discussion of results.
Results
The two regions of interest, TeO and CB were coded and counted at the same
time with no indication of which specific region each image came from. Immediately
following counting, the mean cell number of control TeO was compared to that of the
control CB and no significant difference was detected (t-0.226, P-0.8248, df-12).
