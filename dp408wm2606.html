And Inhibits Histone Hl Kinase Inactivation
In the Sea Urchin Embryo
Abstract
The development of sea urchin eggs in a 6.7 pH buffer causes
slowed progression through mitosis with eventual arrest in
metaphase and sustained levels of Histone HI Kinase activity.
pH sensitive step or a number of steps must exist in the
pathway for inactivation of MPF or histone HI Kinase, probably by
effecting the destruction of cyclin. The developing eggs were
arrested at metaphase because the signal for progression through
anaphase, MPF inactivation, never appeared.
Introduction
The cell cycle is now known to be largely controlled by the
phosphorylating activity of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF).1 2
Activation of MPF induces mitosis and deactivation of MPF is
required for the exit from mitosis. MPF has been shown to be
made up of two distinct subunits, cyclin and the odc2 molecule.3
Cdc2 is known to be a mitotic kinase that is activated by the
regulatory cyclin, whose activity and abundance follows the cell
cycle. During interphase, cyclin is synthesized and accumulates
until the beginning of metaphase. As cyclin levels rise, it
binds to the inactive un-phosphorylated form of odc2. Cdc2 is
then phosphorylated creating an inactive form of MPF. This pre¬
MPF is made active by dephosphorylation of odc2 and
phosphorylation of the cyclin subunit, causing entry into
mitosis 4 5 6 7 8 The transition from metaphase to anaphase is
induced by the inactivation of MPF, which is itself caused by
cyclin degradation. As interphase is reached, cyclin degradation
ceases and its accumulation begins again. Many have shown that
blocking or inhibiting cyclin degradation during mitosis causes
cells to arrest in metaphase; one method used cyclin mutants
which were resistant to proteolysis.9
Less is presently known about the mechanisms for exit from
mitosis than for entry into mitosis. It has been shown that
cyclin degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin pathway 10
destruction box" in the amino-terminal of cyclin itself seems
necessary for its destruction. A cyclin phosphatase also seems
needed to deactivate cyclin; using okadaic acid or anti¬
phosphatase antibodies to inhibit type 1 protein phosphatases
caused stabilization of histone Hl kinase and MPF activity. 11 It
was shown that cyclin degradation also seems regulated in some
way by odc2 kinase activity, creating a feedback mechanism in the
control of MPF activity. 12 A lag of 25 minutes until degradation
was observed.
In my experiments, using sea urchin eggs suspended in a ph
6.7 buffered sea water before the onset of mitosis, arrest at
metaphase was observed. Since cyclin degradation is required for
exit from metaphase, this lead to speculation that a pH sensitive
step was important somewhere in the pathway of MPF deactivation.
An MPF assay showed that, in fact, histone HI kinase activity, a
direct measure of MPF, did not cycle but stayed at an elevated
level. It appears that some pathway for cyclin destruction is
very ph sensitive.
Materials and Methods
Animals
The sea urchin <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Strongylocentrotus purpuratus : Exact'>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</span> was used in all cell
cycle experiments. Spawning was done by physical disturbance
and/or injecting with .5 M KCl. Sperm was collected dry and kept
cold. Eggs were poured through a 90 nm mesh to remove impurities
and some of the jelly coat. Eggs were kept stirred in a 17' C
water bath until used. Fertilization was induced by diluting
sperm in sea water and adding to an egg suspension. Eggs were
kept stirred if suspension was above.1%. When suspending in
buffer solution, eggs were first centrifuged to allow pouring off
of sea water. Eggs were then resuspended in buffer solution.
Buffer solution
The buffer solution used was 50mM Pipes, 25mM Na Acetate, and sea
water. This solution was brought to desired pH and kept at same
temperature of eggs in water bath.
Cytological Observation and Fixation
5% aliquots of eggs were removed from sea water or acetate
buffer at desired times after fertilization and resuspended in a
1 ml KGE and Triton solution. A 100 ml KGE solution contained
7 gm K Gluconic Acid, 2.4 gm Glycine, 76 mg EGTA, 48 mg
MgCl2 (6H20) and distilled water and was brought to pH 6.0. A 1%
portion of the detergent triton was dissolved in this solution.
After 5 minutes, 20 ul of formaldehyde was added to each 1 ml
sample of eggs. The samples were then stored in the cold. In
order to determine proper stage in mitosis, a fluorescent dye
that stains DNA was used. Samples were centrifuged and KGE,
triton and formaldehyde solution was aspirated away. 1 ml of KGE
containing the fluorescent dye, DAPI, was added to samples. A
microscope equipped with fluorescent bulb and proper filters was
used to view eggs.
listone Hl Kinase Assay
Hl Kinase assay was performed according to Meijer and Pondaven
procedure with slight modifications. 13 The homogenization buffer
contained 60 mM B-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate,
25 mM Hepes, 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, .1 mM
Na Vanadate, and .1 mM potassium fluoride. Similar modifications
were made with the assay buffer: 1.1 ul protein kinase inhibitor,
8 mg histone in a 1 ml final volume.
Results
Incubating developing sea urchin eggs in the sea water¬
acetate buffer at pH 6.7, revealed two distinct periods of
sensitivity to this treatment along with a general slowing trend
throughout mitosis. The first period is before pro-nuclear
fusion; the second period is before metaphase.
Development Arrests Before Pro-Nuclear Fusion
The first period of sensitivity exists in the first 30 minute
period after fertilization. Sea urchin eggs were removed from
sea water and resuspended in a pH 6.7 buffer at various time
intervals and subsequent development was followed. Aliquots of
eggs were fixed in KGE at various times to determine mitosis
progression. In cells where pronuclear fusion had not taken
place, the sperm pro-nuclei could be seen on its migration toward
the egg pro-nuclei. These cells would be arrested at this
position for several hours with no noticeable difference. No
spindles or asters were recognized in these cells. If pronuclear
fusion had already taken place, cells would begin developing at a
slow rate when resuspended in 6.7 pH buffer,
Development Arrests At Metaphase/Anaphase Transition
Suspending developing eggs in the buffer after 45 minutes, well
after pronuclear fusion, resulted in general slowing of mitosis
progression and eventual arrest at late metaphase. The slowing
of mitosis was always observed in eggs developing in low pH
buffers, but the amount of retardation varied with the batches of
eggs used. Other than this, the slowing of mitosis has a direct
correlation with the pH of the medium. This was demonstrated in
an experiment where the same batch of eggs were resuspended in
buffers of pH 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and 7.0, along with the control which
remained in normal sea water. The lower the pH, the slower the
eggs progressed in mitosis; eventually all reached metaphase
arrest. (Fig 1, a-d)
To determine if pH was important for subsequent cell cycles,
developing sea urchin eggs were resuspended in acetate after
completion of the first cleavage. Again the pattern of slow
development and eventual metaphase arrest was observed;
developing eggs arrested at the metaphase/anaphase transition in
the two cell stage. (Fig 2, a,b)
Abnormalities Observed in Prolonged Metaphase Arrest
Cytological observation revealed some abnormalities in cell
structure and development in eggs incubated in the pH 6.7 buffer,
The most obvious difference was the mitotic apparatuses were not
as apparent as in the controls. The spindles seemed less
developed than controls; microtubules were shorter and less
abundant and the centers were not as far apart. Spindle
formation also took place at a slower rate than controls and
never became fully developed in most cells.
Another abnormality was the presence of one or two extra
microtubule centers in eggs that developed in buffer for a couple
of hours. Polyspermy was not present in these cells, especially
at the frequency of multiple spindles observed. Not all cells
contained an extra spindle. Cells with two spindles would
sometimes have elongated centrosomes,
Abnormal metaphase was also observed in many cells after
continued arrest in the metaphase position. The chromosomes
appeared to fan out and disperse but still retain their condensed
forms. They did not migrate towards the poles but seemed to stay
attached to the end of the spindle microtubules. The beginning
of anaphase, or the separation of the kinetechores, could have
been reached, but without the normal depolymerization of the
microtubule fibers. Some of the other abnormal metaphase eggs
could be accounted for by the poorly developed mitotic apparatus
or the extra spindles.
Histone HI Kinase Activity Does Not Cycle
The Hl Kinase assay showed that MPF activity increased and stayed
at an elevated level in the eggs subjected to the pH 6.7 acetate
buffer sea water. Hl Kinase activity increased more rapidly than
the controls and remained at a high level as the controls cycled.
In all assays, Hl Kinase activity rises at the same time, or just
after, the controls. It then peaks at about 1.5x the highest
levels of the controls and stays close to this level for the next
couple of hours. Some fluctuations are present over all
experiments that seem similar; the peak rises very quickly, then
drops by about 20% only to rise again and then stay fairly level
for the duration of the experiment. (Fig 3, a-b)
It is noteworthy that HI Kinase activity remains high and
does not cycle like the controls, indicating that MPF was not
inactivated in the eggs that were in the acidic buffer.
Cytological observation revealed that in the controls, the
pro-metaphase stage in development corresponded to the peak in HI
kinase activity. (Fig 3,c)
Discussion
These results show that lowering the external pH in which eggs
are developing effects internal mechanisms in a profound way.
If
added before pronuclear fusion, it arrests sea urchin eggs at
this stage. If added after this sensitive time, it slows mitosis
considerably and eventually arrests mitosis at metaphase. The
explanation for this appears to be the prevention of inactivation
of MPF, since it has been shown that inactivation of MPF is the
signal that triggers onset of anaphase and continued progression
through mitosis. Since inactivation of MPF is caused ultimately
by the destruction of cyclin, acidic pH probably prevents this
destruction.
It was shown in starfish,10 that okadaic acid, a inhibitor
of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, prevented MPF inactivation
probably by preventing cyclin degradation. Other similarities
exist in the okadaic acid experiment and my experiment s results,
including pronuclear fusion arrest, prevention of normal spindle
and microtubule formation, as well as metaphase arrest.
This
correlation points to the cyclin phosphatases that are
responsible for oyclin degradation as possible candidates for ph
sensitivity.
Cdc2 kinase activity may also exhibit pH sensitivity.
If
the odc2 kinase protein can stay active in acidic pH without
being bound to the cyclin subunit, HI Kinase activity would
probably be observed. This might also account for the immediate
drop in activity followed by increasing activity observed in the
Hl Kinase assays. Cyclin could still be degraded while odc2
becomes active again, preventing development out of metaphase.
Another possibility includes the ubiquitin pathway being
directly affected by pH. If ubiquitin conjugation is somehow
prevented, cyclin will not be targeted for degradation and Hl
Kinase activity will not decrease. Also if the proteolytic
enzyme is inhibited by acidic pH, similar results might be
observed.
A Ca++ transient dependant Kinase may also be responsible
for the pH sensitivity in HI Kinase activity. It is thought that
a Ca+t transient signal at metaphase helps trigger the cell to
degrade cyclin and that Ca++ sequestration is very pH sensitive.
Inhibition of this signal could result, leading to sustained HI
kinase activity.
Any of the intermediate steps, or many of them, in any of
these given, or unknown, possibilities could exhibit a pH
sensitivity that might affect MPF activity. The results cannot
differentiate between any of these possibilities. In various
methods, experiments in the future might try to determine pH
effects on specific known steps of cyclin degradation and MPE
activity.
