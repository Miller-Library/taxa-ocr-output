was added to wash each well and then removed thoroughly. One hundred
ul of distilled H2O was added to each well to lyse the macrophages, and the
well was scraped vigorously. The lysate of each well was collected and
pooled for each treatment group. The protein in the lysate samples was
concentrated by using centricon tubes and centrifuging at 4000 g.
Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis. Twenty one
ul of each sample were added to 9 ul of sample buffer (120 mM tris base,
4% w/v SDS, 10% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% v/v glycerol, and 3mM
bromophenol blue), then vortexed and placed in a boiling water bath for 3
min. Samples were run on 12 % acrylamide gel and 4.5 % acrylamide
stacking gel, for 1.5 h at approximately 20mAmps.
Western Blotting. Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose by
electrophoresis at 20 mA for 30min. and then 200 mA for 2 hrs. at 4째C in a
wet transblot apparatus. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in
tris buffered saline (TBS)/0.1% Tween 20/5 % nonfat milk for 2 hours at
37째C. The blots were then washed with IX TBS, TBS/0.5% Tween and again
with IX TBS. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at
4째C with different monoclonal antibodies: 4D3, and 3HI(provided by
Wiens, G. et al.), at a dilution of 1:25 and 1:50 respectively, in
TBS/Tween/milk. The Blots were washed and incubated in sheep anti-
mouse horseradish-peroxidase conjugated (Sigma) secondary antibody at a
dilution of 1:1000 in IX TBS for one hour, at 25째C. After washing in IX
TBS, the blots were placed in a Chemiluminescent Reagent (Renaissance)
for 1 min. and then were exposed to film.
