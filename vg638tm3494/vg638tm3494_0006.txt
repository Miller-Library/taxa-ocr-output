taken. The cells were washed once more and resuspended in 500 ul of
PBS. They were then incubated with active trout serum for 1 h at 25째C, to
increase opsonization. The cells were resuspended to give a concentration
of 1.3 x10 9 cells/ml and 50 ul were added to each well of macrophage
culture. An aliquot of R. salmoninarum cells was incubated with 0.3%
formalin for 30 min at room temperature. These killed R. salmoninarum
cells were added to control wells of macrophage cultures. R. salmoninarum
was incubated with the macrophages for 22-24 hours.
Phagocytosis Assay. The procedure of Rose and Levine (1992) was
followed. Briefly, macrophages were adhered to slides after isolation from
rainbow trout as described above. These slides were then incubated with
R. salmoninarum cells for two hours, during which time phagocytosis
occurred. The slides were then fixed with 2% w/v formaldehyde for 15
min at 25째C and washed in PBS. In order to block excess free aldehyde
groups, the slides were incubated for 10 min at 25째C in L-15 media. The
slides were incubated in a polyclonal, goat anti-R. salmoninarum antibody
(Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) for one hour, washed and then
incubated in the dark with rabbit anti-goat antibody conjugated to FITC
(Sigma), diluted 1:100 in L-15. To stain the macrophages slides were
washed with PBS and incubated with 0.001% w/v Hoescht 3328 stain for 2
min at 25째C. Mounting media (.5M Na2CO3 and glycerol in a 1:l ratio) was
placed on each slide. A coverslip was added and the samples were viewed
at 380 nm for the Hoescht stain and 490 nm for the FITC.
Lysing of the macrophages. Using a sterile Pasteur pipet, the media from
each of the wells of cultured macrophages was removed. One ml of PBS
