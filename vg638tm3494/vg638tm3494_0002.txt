Abstract
Renibacterium salmoninarum is an intracellular pathogen that survives
within the macrophages of salmonids. The ability of R.salmoninarum to
produce p57, a major surface antigen of the bacterium, while inside
rainbow trout macrophages was determined. R. salmoninarum was
incubated with rainbow trout macrophages isolated from the head kidney
and spleen, and phagocytosis occurred as demonstrated by
immunofluorescence. Macrophages were then lysed and a Western blot
was run on the lysate, to determine the presence of p57. Macrophages
incubated with only L-15 media showed no p57 production nor did
macrophages incubated with killed R. salmoninarum. Macrophages
incubated with R. salmoninarum showed the presence of p57, thus
indicating that p57 was produced by R. salmoninarum while inside the
trout macrophages. These results suggest that p57 may play a role in the
intracellular survival of R. salmoninarum..
Introduction
Bacterial kidney disease (BKD) is a serious infection of salmonids that
progresses slowly and is often fatal (Evelyn 1987). The disease has been
shown to be both vertically and horizontally transmitted. Horizontal
transmission occurs in the wild with several species of trout while vertical
transmission has recently been shown to occur though the egg (Evelyn et
al. 1984). Renibacterium salmoninarum, the bacteria that causes the
disease is able to infect the egg through the micropyle without producing
