Evidence of Phagocytosis by Immunofluorescence
In order to determine whether phagocytosis had occurred, trout
macrophages and R. salmoninarum were stained with fluorescent dyes.
Fluorescence emitted by R. salmoninarum in the same location as the
fluorescence of the macrophage indicated that R. salmoninarum was inside
the macrophage.
Diagnosis of Fish for R. salmoninarum
The results of the ELISA and PCR showed that the trout were negative
for R. salmoninarum (data not shown).
Quantitative Analysis of p57 in the Washes of R. salmoninarum
In order to ensure the complete removal of p57 from the surface of R.
salmoninarum, bacteria were washed five times with distilled water. The
last wash shows no p57, indicating that p57 had been removed from the
cell surface.
Production of p57 by R. salmoninarum
Western blot analysis was performed on the lysate samples of the
experimentally infected macrophages, the non-infected macrophages, and
R. salmoninarum cells, in order to determine the presence of p57. Trout
macrophages incubated with L-15 media showed no p57, (Fig. 3), nor did
the trout macrophages incubated with killed R. salmoninarum.
Macrophages incubated with R. salmoninarum showed p57 production,
