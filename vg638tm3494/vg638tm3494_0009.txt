although less than that in R. salmoninarum alone. The supernatant of the
fifth wash unexpectedly showed a large amount of p57.
The same samples were probed with a different monoclonal antibody to
verify previous results and to avoid false positives for p57 due to cross¬
reactions. Trout macrophages incubated with only L-15 media showed no
band at the 57 kD region, however a band did appear at about 75-80 kD.
R. salmoninarum incubated with macrophages showed both a band at 57
kD (indicating p57) as well as a band at 75-80 KD. Whereas, R.
salmoninarum incubated with only L-15 media showed a band only at 57
KD which was p57. The bands of lower molecular weight in the p57
antigen (DiagXotics) positive control are the result of proteolysis.
Discussion
The Western blot of experimental and control groups of macrophages and
R. salmoninarum, indicates that R. salmoninarum when phagocytosed by
macrophages, does produce p57. Since macrophages incubated with killed
R. salmoninarum showed no presence of p57, the possibility that the p57
detected in the lysate sample of macrophages incubated with R.
salmoninarum was due to p57 released from the bacteria’s surface was
eliminated. Furthermore, since the macrophages incubated with R.
saloninarum were washed of bacteria and extracellular protein several
times before lysis, the presence of p57 must be due to its production by
the R. salmoninarum inside the macrophages.
The production of p57 by R. salmoninarum within trout macrophages
has important implications. It suggests that R. salmoninarum remains
