viable while inside the macrophage, at least in terms of p57 protein
production. Furthermore p57 might have a role in the intracellular
survival of R. salmoninarum. It is possible that p57 may act on the
macrophage to alter its intracellular environment and make it more
hospitable. Or p57 might serve to protect R. salmoninarum from the
cytotoxicity of the macrophage (Bandin et al. 1993). Since R.
salmoninarum has been characterized to have hemolysin-like activity, it is
also possible that p57 acts as the hemolysin (Turaga et al. 1987).
This information, that p57 is produced intracellularly, suggests that an
antigen does exist however the macrophages may be unable to process it
and present it to T cells to elicit a normal immune response to eliminate
the bacteria. This may be the result of the biochemical properties of p57.
tolerance or the protein's possible affect on the macrophage's antigen
processing ability. In either case, if the antigen is not presented, then T
cells cannot respond by lysing the macrophage or by stimulating cytokine
production.
It is also important to examine that monoclonal antibodies specific to
p57 seem to cross react with proteins in the 70-80 kD range, such as in the
sample of macrophages incubated in L-15 media. This has two
implications. One is that the trout macrophages produce a protein with a
similar epitope as p57. Another is that there may be other intracellular
pathogens such as Pseudamonas maltophila and Carnobacteruim piscicola
that can produce a protein with common epitopes to p57 (Brown et al.
1995). In experiments we performed, trout that were negative for the p57
gene by PCR cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies specific to R.

well as with monoclonal antibodies specific to p57. The presence of many
