It is theorized that p57 might play a role in the intracellular survival
of R. salmoninarum. Our purpose was to determine whether p57 was
produced by R. salmoninarum, inside the macrophage. This information
would illustrate the viability of R. salmoninarum while inside the
macrophage as well as indicate whether p57 was in a location to play a
role in the intracellular survival of the bacteria.
Materials and Methods
Bacteria. R. salmoninarum were obtained from Oregon.
Serum. Blood from the caudal vein of the trout was collected in a glass
tube and allowed to clot at 4°C for 4-6 hours. The serum was extracted
and then spun at 18,000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed
and stored at -70°C.
Isolation of Macrophages. Rainbow trout were maintained at 12°C in a
freshwater circulating tank. Macrophages were isolated using the method
of Rose and Levine (1992). The fish were killed and blood for serum was
collected from the caudal vein. The head kidney and spleen of each fish
were removed aseptically and placed in 2 ml of L-15 media containing 2%
heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 iu/ml of penicillin-streptomycin, and
10 iu/ml of heparin. A cell suspension was created by passing the head
kidney and spleen tissue through a sieve, using a sterile syringe plunger
Percoll gradients had been previously made of 34% Percoll (3.4 ml of
Percoll, 1 ml of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, and 5.6 ml of distilled H2O)
