Fig. la-b Photographs of immunofluorescence demonstrating phagocytosis by rainbow trout
macrophages of R. salmoninarum. Fig. la Hoescht 3328 counterstain showing macrophage
nuclei, viewed at wavelegnth of 380 nm. Fig. Ib FITC conjugated secondary antibody specific for
goat anti-R. salmoninarum (polyclonal) showing bacteria, viewed at wavelegnth 490 nm.
Fig. 2 Western blot analysis of the supernatants collected from each of five washes of R.
salmoninarum using a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (DiagXotics). Lanes 1-5 represent
supernatant of washes 1-5, respectively
Fig. 3 Western Blot of various treatment groups and controls of rainbow trout macrophages and
R. salmoninarum, using the monoclonal antibody 4D3. Lanes are as follows: 1. Bio-Rad
prestained molecular weight standard, 2. trout macrophages incubated with L-15 media, 3. trout
macrophages incubated with R. salmoninarum, 4. trout macrophages incubated with killed R.
salmoninarum, 5. R. salmoninarum incubated in L-15 and washed 2X with Phosphate Buffered
Saline, 6. R. salmoninarum incubated with distilled H2O, 7. supernatant of the fifth wash of R.
salmoninarum, 8. p57 antigen (DiagXotics), 9.Bio-Rad prestained molecular weight standards.
The weights of Bio-Rad prestained molecular markers are listed on the left.
