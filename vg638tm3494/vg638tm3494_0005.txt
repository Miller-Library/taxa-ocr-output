layered on top of 51% Percoll (5.1 mls of Percoll, Iml of Hank's Balanced
Salt Solution, and 3.9 ml of distilled H2O) in 15 ml sterile tubes. The cell
suspension was carefully layered onto the Percoll gradients using a sterile
Pasteur pipet. The gradients were then spun for 40 minutes at 400 g. The
cells were removed from the 34% and 51% Percoll interface. Cells were
counted and the cell density was adjusted to 1.4-2.5 x 10 7 cells/ml with
L-15 containing .1% Fetal Calf Serum and 100 iu/ml penicillin-
streptomycin. A final concentration of 4-7.5 x10 7 cells per well was
made. The cell cultures were incubated at 17Â°C for 2 h, following which
the media was replaced with 3 ml/well of L-15 containing 5% Fetal Calf
Serum and 100 iu/ml penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were observed
under an inverted microscope and appeared adherent and confluent. The
macrophages were used within 24 hours of isolation.
Test Trout for R. salmoninarum
ELISA (DiagXotics) was performed on kidney tissue from each fish,
according to the protocol provided and all samples were negative.
Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine whether the gene for
p57 existed in sample tissue. Following the protocol by Brown et al.(1993).
all fish proved to be negative for R. salmoninarum.
Incubation of R. salmoninarum with trout macrophages.
R. salmoninarum cells were suspended in eppendorf tubes, containing 1
ml each of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Eppendorf tubes of cells were
washed five times with 100 ul distilled H2O, to remove p57 from the cell
surfaces. Five tubes of live R. salmoninarum cells were pooled and
resuspended in 1 ml of distilled H2O, after which an O.D. 540 reading was
