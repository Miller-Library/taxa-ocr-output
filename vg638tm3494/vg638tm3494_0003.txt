toxins that would damage the egg (Evelyn 1987). The disease does not
appear until the fish are 6-12 months of age by which time the industry
has spent a considerable amount of effort and money in rearing the fish.
R. salmoninarum is a gram positive, non-motile diplobacillus. The
bacterium is an intracellular pathogen that enters the macrophage, the
antigen presenting cell of the immune system, and is able to survive there
despite the toxic conditions of the cell (Evenden 1993). The mechanisms of
R. salmoninarum survival are unknown, however several recent studies on
the relationship between macrophages and R. salmoninarum have been
made (Bandin et al. 1993). They have shown that upon infection with R.
salmoninarum, the macrophage is activated and responds by an increase in
superoxide anion production, indicating respiratory burst. In addition, this
research demonstrated that macrophages incubated with R. salmoninarum
and subsequently incubated with Aeromonas salmonicida, a second fish
pathogen, were able to kill A. salmonicida but unable to kill R.
salmoninarum. This suggests that R. salmoninarum does not completely
inhibit the macrophage bactericidal activity but instead is able to resist
killing.
The major surface antigen of R. salmoninarum is p57. This protein has
been cloned and sequenced and has been shown to be produced in large
quantities by R. salmoninarum, in culture (Evenden 1993). Antibodies to
the protein have been detected in the sera of trout with BKD. In addition,
several monoclonal antibodies specific to p57 epitopes have been produced
to further characterize p57 (Wiens and Kataari 1991). This major protein
of R. salmoninarum has been described as an agglutinin (Daly and
Stevenson 1990) and has been shown to have hemolysin-like qualities
(Turaga et al. 1987).
