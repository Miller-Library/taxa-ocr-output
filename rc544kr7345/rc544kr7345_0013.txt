Ring, W. L.: Argulus borealis from Sanddabs
page 13
Pressure may have influenced the results. All experiments
were run at 1 atm., which contrasts sharply with the 6 or
7 atm. from which the branchiurids were collected. Possibly
the collected results are only applicable to the behavior
of A. borealis in the top of the water column where the
pressure is low.
These results only deepen the mystery of the host
finding method of A. borealis. More work is need to bring
light to this subject.
