Ring, W. L.: Argulus borealis from Sanddabs
page 6
No change in behavior was noted for the first hour,
but later branchiurids swam more slowly and finally died
within 15 hours (Fig. 3).
Wilson's 1903 studies of the salt water species A.
laticauda and A. Megalops from the Atlantic flat fish
Paralichtys reported that "they gave apparently no attention
to the change, but continued to swim about in the fresh
water as they had done in the salt." Bower-Shore (1940)
suggested that the freshwater species A. foliaceus could
not survive a rapid transition from fresh to salt water.
Wilson's study has been widely reported. Cameron (1956)
states, "Branchiurids can change from salt to fresh water
with ease.'
I conclude that A. borealis cannot survive transfer
from salt to fresh water. This finding contradicts the
results of Wilson. Possibly he did not run his experiments
long enough or different species may be more resistant.
(c) A. borealis survival time in air
The survival time of A. borealis in air was studied
to explain the host leaving behavior observed when the host
was placed in shallow water.
