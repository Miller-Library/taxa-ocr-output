Branchiurids were removed from the water, blotted,
and placed on a paper towel to soak up moisture, as described
by Bower-Shore (1940).
Branchiurids were immobile and under distress.
They were unable to support their main body structures.
Body surface appeared to be moist. Twitching occurred
for the first 5 min., afterwhich movement occurred only
when disturbed. No movement was observed after 25 min,
Death occurred in less than 1 hour. No change in body
coloration was noted. If the specimens were returned to
salt water after 10 min., death still occurred within a
few hours. (Fig. 4)
The fresh water species A. foliaceus had an average
survival period in excess of 15 hours and a rose coloration
at the time of death (Bower-Shore, 1940).
Branchiurids left their host when the fish was repeatly
and rapidly exposed to air and then water. If the fish
was completely exposed to air, the branchiurid was unable
to leave due to immobility in air. If the fish was not
exposed to enough air, the branchiurid found no motivation
to leave the host. In the field, this type of exposure
might well be interpretable by the branchiurid that dessication
in air was imminent, particularly as Sanddabs are bottom
