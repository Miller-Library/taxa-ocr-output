Ring, W. L.: Argulus borealis from Sanddabs
page 4
During experiments, death was defined as when the
body fluids stopped flowing inside the specimen. Temperature
was that of the sea water system, about 15° C., unless
otherwise noted. Room temperature was between 20° and
24° C. Water salinity was that of Monterey Bay, California.
Results and Discussion:
(1) Physiological stress studies--
Experiments were conducted to determine the physiological
stress parameters on A. borealis in a free swimming condition
to determine the factors affecting behavior. The survival
time in a free swimming condition in running and stagnant
sea water, in fresh water, and in air were studied,
(a) Longevity of A. borealis free swimming in sea water
Survival time of free swimming A. borealis was measured
as an index of the time limit for host finding, particularly
during the mating process.
