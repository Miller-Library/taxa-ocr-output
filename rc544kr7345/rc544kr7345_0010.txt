(c) Heliotropic responses in A. borealis
Experiments were run to determine the effect of
light and dark colors on the free swimming branchiurid,
The cylinder was vertically oriented. Experiments
were run with a white top and a black bottom, with a black
top and a white bottom, with a white top and bottom, and
with a black top and bottom.
A white top with a black bottom caused the branchiurids
to collect within a few centimeters of the top. (student
"T" test, p-.01) A black top with a white bottom induced
the branchiurids to concentrate towards the bottom (student
"T" test, p-.01). A white top and bottom caused clumping
at the ends of the cylinder (student "T" test, p-.02).
A black top and bottom caused clumping in the middle (student
"T" test, p-.01; Fig. 7,8).
Bower-Shore (1940) reported a strong, negative heliotropism
in A. foliaceus. Possibly there is a seasonal variation
of just species differences between the two species.
Studies indicate the presence of a strong, positive
heliotropism in A. borealis.
