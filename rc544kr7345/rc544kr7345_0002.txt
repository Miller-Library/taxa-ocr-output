four pairs of swimming legs. Although adult form is achieved
after the first molt, the larger specimens are often the
product of up to seven molts. The reproductive organs are
present at birth. Females tend to be slightly larger than
males. The reproductive cycle is run three times per year,
This means that the branchiurid must leave its host at least
three times a year (Tokioka, 1936).
Although there is a fairly extensive literature
available on species morphology (Martin, 1932; Meehean, 1940:
and Wilson, 1903,1944), development (Tokioka, 1936), and
incidence (Wilson, 1903 and Rizvi, 1969), there has been
very little work done on branchiurid behavior (Wilson, 1903
and Bower-Shore, 1940). Most studies have been on the
fresh-water species Argulus foliaceus. The family Argulidae
is economically signifant because it causes serious depredations
on fish populations in confined environments, fish hatcheries,
for example (Wilson, 1903 and Meehean, 1940).
This report describes some physiological stress parameters
and behavioral tropism of Argulus borealis in a free swimming
condition. Physiological stress studies were conducted in
normal, stagnant, and fresh water and in air. Tests were
run to determine the presence of geotropisms, heliotropisms,
and general free swimming behavior.
