Ring, W. L.: Argulus borealis from Sanddabs
page 3
Materials and Methods:
A. borealis were collected from the Pacific Sanddab,
Citharichtys sordidus. Identification was according to
Miller and Lea (1972). They were obtained by hook and line
bottom fishing in Monterey Bay, California about one mile
off Lover's Point at depths ranging from 150 ft. to 250 ft.
The fish were stored in a .34 m. deep, open air tank with
running sea water and were fed sliced squid.
All collections and observations were made between
April 15 and June 1, 1980 as part of 175H at Hopkins Marine
Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California,
Branchiurids were removed from fish by placing them
in water, deep enough so that it lapped over the fish, but
shallow enough so that the gills were exposed and caused
distress and flapping by the fish. Branchiurids would almost
immediately leave the host and were then collected with a
syringe.
Branchiurids were tentatively identified as Argulus
borealis (Wilson, 1912), with the following discrepancies:
collected specimens possessed flagellated appendages and only
six rings on the ribs of the suckers, compared with hairless
appendages and nine rings on the ribs of the suckers.
Specimens were divided into three categories according to
size: less than .2 mm = small; .2 mm to 1 mm.- medium; and
larger than 1 mm = large.
