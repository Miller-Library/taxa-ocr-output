(d) Behavior of A. borealis in a current
Studies were made to determine the effect of water
movement on free swimming branchiurids.
Branchiurids were placed in a thin, long glass tube,
open on both ends. Water was pumped through the tube,
creating a current. The strength of the current was varied.
In the presence of a current, branchiurids always
oriented and swam against that current. Swimming speeds
of up to 1 ft. per 9 sec. or 400 ft. per hr. were achieved.
In strong currents, branchiurids would attach to the side
of the tube.
(e) Behavior of A. borealis with damaged eyes
Experiments were done to determine the functional
significance of the eyes to the free swimming behavior of
branchiurids.
Eyespots were destroyed by poking and teasing them
with a needle. Branchiurids were then returned to sea water.
Branchiurids made tight, rapid, continual flips which
continued until the first stages of death. In the presence
of a current, these flips would cease and counter-current
swimming would begin. No other tropisms were noted.
Heliotropism in A. borealis is dependent on intact
eyes. Counter-current swimming is not.
