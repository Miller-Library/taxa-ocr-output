(3) General discussion-
The behavioral repertoire for locating a bottom fish
host by a swimming parasite should include positive geotropism
and negative heliotropism, both of which would guide the
parasite to the bottom and thus to the host. This is just
the opposite of the experimental results which showed a
negative geotropism and a positive heliotropism. In a
behavioral repertoire for locating a high water column host,
these traits would be advantagous. In other words, it
appears as if the behavior of A. borealis is well suited
for a high water column fish parasite, but poorly adaptive
for a bottom fish parasite,
Rizvi (1969) noted a large seasonal fluctuation in
particular fish species infection rates. He theorized
that the infection rate in bottom fish would be highest
during the breeding season when the branchiurids went to
the bottom to lay eggs, and would then drop as branchiurids
returned to the higher water column fish for the rest of
the season. If this were indeed the case, it is possible
that my data was collected after the reproductive period
and that the branchiurids were leaving their bottom fish
host for those fish higher up. Thus the theoretical behavioral
traits would closely match experimental results.
