Ring, W. L.: Argulus borealis from Sanddabs

The cylinder was placed horizontally. A plastic tent
was constructed around the experimental apparatus to decrease
the influence of environmental variables.
Resultant movement of the branchiurid was stastically
random (student "T" test, p-.0l; Fig. 5). Note that in
the graph, the means were almost the same for all areas. (Fig. 6)
This means that any non-random movement by the
branchiurid found in the experimentation using this apparatus
was not due to the cylinder.
(b) Geotropic responses in A. borealis
The effect of gravity on the free swimming branchiurid's
movement patterns was evaluated.
This was accomplished by placing the cylinder vertically.
Light and colors in the area of the cylinder were kept constant
by the plastic tent.
Branchiurids were observed to move towards the upper
regions. Movement may have been random (student "T" test.
p=.14).
Observations seem to suggest the presence of a negative
geotropic behavior. More experiments need to be run to
confirm this,
