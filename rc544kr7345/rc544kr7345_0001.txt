Introduction:
Branchiurids, commonly called "Carp Lice or "Fish
Lice", are members of the class Crustacea. They superficially
resemble the Copepoda, but differ mainly in having a flattened
body; two large, movable compound eyes; an unsegmented,
limbless, bilobed abdomen; and four pairs of biramous thoracic
limbs. The mouth parts are characterized by a retractable,
poison spine in front of a moveable, cylinder-like proboscis,
The second maxillae are altered to form sucking disks which
enable branchiurids to cling to their hosts. With these
disks, they can move rapidly over the moist skin of a fish
with a scuttling, waddling motion (Fig. 1). They are all
wholly external parasites. Both sexes swim freely, actively,
and often. They are found on both fresh and salt water fish,
with a world wide distribution. (Cameron, 1956 and Noble
and Noble, 1964).
Branchiurids have a straight forward and well documented
life cycle. They have no egg sacs. Both sexes leave their
host at the breeding season. The eggs are laid in clusters
of 30 to 600 on a fixed, hard substratum and are fertilized
as laid by sperm obtained from a prior mating (Meehean, 1940
and Cameron, 1956). Eggs from salt-water species hatch
in four to six weeks, yielding advanced larvae, having
