fish. Since branchiurids die so rapidly in air, it might
be better to risk the 10 day time limit for finding a new
host instead of the 15 min. time limit for returning to
the water from the air.
(2) Behavioral Studies-
The behavior of A. borealis in a free swimming condition
was studied in an attempt to understand the mechanisms used
in host finding.
All behavioral experiments were conducted in a glass
cylinder, 30 x 225 mm, which was divided by labeling into
8 equal areas. The cylinder was openable on one end and
always closed on the other end. Numbering was sequential,
When the cylinder was vertical, area l was always at the
top and area 8 was always at the bottom. Experiments consisted
of placing a branchiurid in the middle of the cylinder with
certain environmental variables controlled. After a 5 min.
wait, area position was recorded every second for 600 seconds.
Any time spent attached to the cylinder was not included in
the data.
(a) Random movement: a control study
Observations were first made to evaluate the possibility
that the experimental cylinder was effecting branchiurid behavior.
