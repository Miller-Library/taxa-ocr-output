Ring, W. L.: Argulus borealis from Sanddabs
page 5
Branchiurids were placed in a bowl of salt water,
stagnant at room temperature, and in a steel wire mesh
box, 9 x 9 x 9 cm., and in a tank with fresh, running sea
water.
A. borealis survived for 4 days in the stagnant
salt water. A maximum survival time of 10 days was observed
in the running salt water (Fig. 2). In both stagnant and
running salt water the branchiurids attached to the sides
of the container more frequently as the experiment progressed.
Bower-Shore (1940) reported an average free-swimming
condition of 15 days for the fresh-water species A. foliaceus.
I conclude that A. borealis has up to 10 days to
find a new host after abandoning a previous host. This means
that within 10 days, branchiurids must leave their previous
host, mate, and find a new host.
(b) Survival of A. borealis in fresh water
A. borealis was studied in fresh water to review a
report in the literature of having the capacity to transfer
from salt to fresh water without problem,
Branchiurids were transferred directly from sea
water to fresh water. The water was not changed or renewed
and was kept at room temperature.
