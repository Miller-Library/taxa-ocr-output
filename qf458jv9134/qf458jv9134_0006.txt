phase with each other except in one instance (Figure 25).
They displayed a reduction of respiration at sunset and
high high tide as did the snails in Figure 2a and were in
agreement with the normally tested snails at low low tide (skowin-
Thigher oxygen consumption).
Two snails, A and E, which had been tested on May 9
were kept in the laboratory for twelve days. They were exposed
to light during laboratory hours, submerged, but not fed.

Snail E disagreed-ieh its previous run in two places
(Figure 35). Its oxygen consumption was reduced at sunset.
It agreed perfectly with the rhythm of the snails on May 21
which were tested at the same time under the normal experimental
conditions. Snail A showed different trends in four places
out of six when compared with its behavior on "ay 9. It
disagreed in two places with the group depicted in Figure 3a.
