suggests that an oxygen debt built up during high high tide
could be paid during low low tide when the snail has an abundant
supply of oxygen, areundhim. An eemet which might suggest
this is that in the field the snails come up out of the water
at night and on foggy days. It can be postulated that if the
snail is moist the respiratory exchange would be even better
in air than in water.

consulted Nr. Walter Holz 83) about investigating
oxygen debt during the two tidal priods. Tests were made
on three snails taken from submerged pools at high high tide
and three snails sitting on rocks in the air at low low tide.
The lactic acid content was approximately twice as great in
1. k.l the snals fron the nign higd tide s it was for tae mnalis
from the low low tide. Mr. Holz also noticed that a snail
which had been submerged in water of reduced oxygen content
would not come out of its shell and start respiring immediately
when it was thrown in fresh sea water. It would,however,
come out of its shell immediately when exposed to air.
