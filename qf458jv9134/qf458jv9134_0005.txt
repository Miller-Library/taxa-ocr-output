immediately afterward, a trend toward lowered oxygen consumption.
At sunset or immediately before or after it, a lowered oxygen
consumption is evident in 11 out of 11 cases (Figures 1, 2a,3a).
During low low tide or the period immediately before or
immediately afterward, oxygen consumption increased in 11 out
of 11 cases (Figures 1,2a,4a). Oxygen consumption was increased
at sunsise over the values during the night in 7 out of 8
cases (Figures 1,la). Once again, it was either at sunrise
or the period immediately before or immediately afterward.
The respiration of small snails was generally greater
totek
than tre larger snails although a linear relationship does
not appear to exist.
Although the animals were collected at different
heights above sea level, and their condition of submersion
at the time of collection varied; the cyclic pattern appeared
to be basically the same. Some snails were treated differently
inside the laboratory: Three snails were sun in the dark
(May 15) along with the three snails which were tested in
