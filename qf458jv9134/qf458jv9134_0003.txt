Near the end of the two hour period, the contents of

the flask was stirred on a magnetic stirrer.This was to avoid
stratification of oxygen.eoneentratien wich might cause errors
in sampling. At the end of the two hour period two samples
were withdrawn from the flask and placed in 35ml Wker
bottles.
The Winkler method as described in C. Rogers (1929
was employed to test oxygen content.
After the samples had been taken a new aerated sea
water supply was provided for the animal for the next two
hours.
The first experiment employed five snails (one to
a flask) which were taken directly from the field and tested
for 25 hours. These animals were exposed to laboratory light
during the entire test period. Their oxygen consumption was
plotted against time and tide (Figure 1). From the pattern
obtained in this test, three more experiments were made to
These
check the trends observed in the 25 hour experiment.
