the diurnal/tidal rhythm was not upset by this treatment, the
similiar times and tides should have given nearly perfect
agreement as in the case of Snail E. Since Snail E seemed
to follow the pattern and Snail A did not,itean netbe
not afparentt
oeneluded-that rhythm is destroyed by starvation or non-
exposure to tides.
Two of the snails tested in the dark on May 15
were kept submerged in the laboratory away from light and
food for ten days. When they were measured along with
normally run experimental animals on May 25, one was tested
in darkness and the other in laboratory light. They had the
oeriod
same trends except for one ihstanee (Figure la). When the
hours coincided (Figure 25), they agreed with their previous
trends three out of three times. Apparently rhythm is not
upset by darkness, absence of wave action, or starvation
over a ten day period.
CONCLUSIONS: The diurnal cycle of Tegula funebralis
is superimposed over the tidal cycle. The fact that the snails
consume more oxygen at low low tide and less at high high tide
