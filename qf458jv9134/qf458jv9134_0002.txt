The purpose of this research was to determine if
Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854) has a diurnal and /or
tidal cycle of oxygen consumption. The animals used were
collected at China Point, Monterey Penigsula, California.
The respiratory chamber was a 125ml vacuum flask
which was fitted with a small stopper in a large stopper
so that samples of water in which the animals had been
respiring could be withdrawn from the flasks with a small
tube fitted onto a syringe. This exposed a minimum surface
of the water to the atmosphere during the sampling.
An animal was placed in a flask along with a small
Terl was
Kled witt aeratel sa
magnetic stirring rod, sea water from an aerated cylinder
was run into a rubber tube attached to the side arm of the
let r te tr
flask, the flask was then sealedy and the animal was left
in the flask for a two hour period.
