SUMMARY: The animals tested were allowed to respire
in sealed flasks and water samples were withdrawn every two
hours and examined for oxygen content by the Winkler method.
Investigation of Snails from China Point (Nonterey Penisula,
California) suggeste-that the snails have a lowered oxygen
consumption at sunset and high high tide, and an increased
oxygen consumption at sunrise and low low tide. The snails
may build up an oxygen debt during high high tide which is
repaid during exposure to air at low low tide. Lactic acid
content of snails at high high tide was about twice as great
as that of snails at low low tide.
