Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -12
OSTERIOR REGENERATION--Results
The process of posterior regeneration was divided
into stages marked by distinct morphological events. A
description of each stage follows, and sketches are shown
on Figure 2.
Stage 1. A piece of the orange gut protruded from
the cut end; the worms otherwise appeared and behaved
normally. The last segment before the cut was constricted,
thereby closing down the area of the wound and giving
the end a "gathered" appearance. Also because of the
constriction the parapodia on the last segment were rotated
toward the rear till they occupied the position of the
anal cirri which had been removed.
tage 2. This stage was marked by a healing of the
cut resulting in a flat, colorless posterior end with no
gut opening visible. In some cases, food material present
in the gut was eliminated by rupture through the lateral
body wall; those individuals in which this occurred died
within a few days.
tage 3. This stage was characterized by the formation
of a red pigmented bump on the healed end.
Stage 4. The formation of an anus on the dorsalside
of the bump usually characterized this stage.
Stage 5. Onset of the fifth stage was marked bythe
appearance of anal cirri at the posterior end. Two of
these colorless projections formed ventrally and two
dorsally on the pygidium.
