common natural food of D. moniloceras according to Marshall,
1976.) The rest of the worms were not fed but it is
possible thy could have eaten plankton and diatoms which
came in with the unfiltered running seawater.
Four groups of worms were divided into anterior
and posterior portions according to three plans. In the
first two groups, worms were cut transversely in either
the anterior region, middle region, or posterior region.
The worms in the third group were cut at levels just
posterior to 20%, 40%, 60% or 80% of their total number
of setigerous segments. Worms in the fourth group were
cut just after segment 15, 30, 45, or 60. This cutting
strategy yielded 63 anterior and 63 posterior pieces of
worms in assorted sizes. The groups were cut at interÂ¬
vals of one or two weeks so that, at any one time, several
stages of regeneration would be observable.
Table 1 shows the sizes of the resulting pieces of
worms, the day on which they were cut (after "day zero"),
and the length of time they survived out of a total of
41 days the the experiment was run. Six worms from the
first series of cuts are not included in the calculations
due to a lack of accurate data.
The worms were observed daily under a dissecting
microscope. Data were recorded on each worm, noting the
stages to which the worm had progressed. These data
appear in Tables 2A, 2B, and Figure 1.
