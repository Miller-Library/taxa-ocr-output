Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -32
changes in
stages, marked byAthe appearance of the cut end. Follow-
ing are the stages recognized in posterior regeneration:
1) wound open; 2) wound healed, but flat; 3)central
protrusion, pigmented; 4) anal aperture forms; 5) anal
cirri appear; 6) new segment delimited; 7) parapodia
form on new segment, other smaller segments form; 8) para-
podia on all new segments. Somewhat similar stages can
be recognized in anterior regeneration: 1) wound open;
2)wound healed; 3) non-pigmented bulge forms on cut
end; 4) mouth opening forms in bulge; 5) invagination
in bulge forms at opening; 6) jaws appear.
3) Posterior regeneration through Stage 8 occurred
in a worm with a head and 9 chaetigers. Anterior regenerÂ¬
ation to Stage 4 was observed in a worm with 19 segments
and a pygidium. A midsection of a worm 38 segments long
regenerated a pygidium and one new segment posteriorly,
and a beginninghof a new prostomium anteriorly.
4) An inverse correlation seems to exist between
the number of segments in a piece of worm and the length
of time necessary for regeneration.
