Regeneration in Dorvillea
on observation of living animals it appears that they
temporarily serve the function of those cirri, indicating
to the worm whether or not something is behind it when
it walks backwards, as it often does.
Also deserving of comment is the origin of the tissues
which make up the regenerated parts. According to the
results of Hill (1969), the regeneration blastema
most
likely originates from differentiated tissues adjacent to
the wound. These tissues representing cells derived from
all three germ layers, de-differentiate from their previous
state and then re-differentiate into the cell types appro-
priate to reconstructing the missing parts.
The sequence of events represented by Stages 1-8
was followed in a majority of cases. However, some variÂ¬
ation was noted, particularly with respect to Stage 3.
In 12 out of 23 cases, a bump characterized by pigmentation
and lacking an anal opening, formed on the end of the
healed segment as outlined. However, in seven cases,
following Stage 2 an opening was present on the bump as
soon as it appeared at the beginning of Stage 3. And
in four instances an opening formed on the end of the
about
last segment at"the end of Stage 2, where little or no
bump at all was present. It seems that the appearance
of an anal opening to the gut is an important step toward
full regeneration. At this point the posterior end of the
gut is functional, although not morphologically complete,
