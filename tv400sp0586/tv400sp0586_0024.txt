Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -25
red-brown cylindrical jaw buds moved in and out of the
small mouth opening in the same manner as the fully
developed jaws in a normal worm.
Furthur stages of prostomial development were not
available for observation at 34 days. The total mean
time for regeneration up to Stage 6 was 19.4 days.

As in posterior regeneration, it seems that the paraÂ¬
podia on the last segment anterior to the cut, temporarily
serve the function of the missing appendages. In this
case, they are oriented in the former positions of the
palps and antennae, and apparently serve as sensory appendages.
In support of this statement, these parapodia were out
of synchrony with the rest of the parapodia while they
occupied the anterior position.
The appearance of the opening in the head bulge
presented an interesting possibility. It seemed that
with this development the worm was able to ingest small
food particles. Although worms were never directly
observed taking in particles, they exhibited apparent
feeding behavior by dragging the bulge, pointed downward
and fully extended, along the bottom of the fingerbowl.
The increased probability of regeneration after this
stage supports the possibility that the worms were no
longer relying on reserves, but that they were capable of
ingesting food. (Table 2B and Figure 1.)
