Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -31
Anterior regeneration through stage four occurred in a
worm containing only 19 segments. A middle section of
worm containing 38 segments had, at the time of writing,
regenerated a pygidium, one new segment, and an opening
to the gut on the prostomial bulge in a period of 34
days.

DISCUSSION
It seems possible that the rate-size correlation
is maintained throughout the regeneration process. Data
are sparse, but two individuals, 9 and 25 segments long,
that were cut on the same day had, at the time of writing
regenerated 6 and 11 segments,respectively.
EVIDENCE OE INJURY AND REGENERATION IN A NATURAL POPULATION
The preceeding study indicates that D. moniloceras
regenerates quite effectively. A survey of a natural
population of 103 worms revealed that 13 of them (12.6%)
were regenerating or showed signs of previous damage
and repair. Six worms had regenerated a pygidium, two
were regenerating a palp, two were regenerating an antenna,
and threehad irregular body markings which suggested
the possibility of previous regeneration.
SUMMARY
Regeneration, both posterior and anterior, are
1)
observed in D. moniloceras.
2) The continuous process of regeneration, both
anterior and posterior, can be broken up into various
