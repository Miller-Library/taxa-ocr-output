Regeneration in Dorvillea

underneath the boat docks, specifically among tunicates
and Phyllochaetopterus tubes. After collection, the worms
were stored in seawater in fingerbowls set in a bath of
running seawater at 14-16° C. All sizes of worms were
used as experimental animals.
After at most a day or two in the laboratory, the
worms were cut. The procedure was to place the worms
in a solution of MgCl, isotonic with seawater, for 15
minutes prior to cutting. The cut was then made with
a razor blade on the posterior side of the desired segment.
The position of the cut was recorded. Both front and
rear pieces of the worm were stored together for the
duration of the experiment. At first the containers used
were glass tubes with plankton netting secured at both
ends, placed in running seawater. No antibiotics were
used. This arrangement allowed an accumulation of
phytoplankton and bacteria which resulted in an abnormally
high mortality rate. Keeping worms in five inch diameter
fingerbowls half filled with seawater proved to be a good
alternative. The bowls were set in a bath of running
seawater and maintained at temperatures ranging from
14-16° C. The water in the bowls was changed daily.
If a worm regenerated to the stage where it could
eat and defacate normally, a tunicate and hydroids were
placed in the bowl to give it an opportunity to feed and
resume a morghatural existence. (Hydroids represent a
