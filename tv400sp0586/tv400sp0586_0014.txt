Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -I5
Stage 6. The first clear appearance of a new segment
at the anterior end of the regenerating tail marked the
beginning of stage six. The new segment was formed posterior
to the last original segment, and remained separated from
the column of tissue which was externally unsegmented,
although sometimes small transverse wrinkles in the cuticle
could be seen. Red pigment was found along the dorsal
side of most of the new tail, with the greatest concen-
tration occurring farthest from the pygidium.
Stage 7. This stage was defined by the appearance
of parapodia on the first new segment. The segments in
the column of tissue between the new segment with parapodia
and the pygidium were distinct, and the amount of pigment
in the whole new tail increased.
Stage 8. In the eighth stage, parapodia were present
on all new segments. The characteristic pattern of two
transverse red bands per segment appeared on the first
several new tail segments while those segments nearest
the pygidium appeared solid red. Additional segments
were generated immediately anterior to the pygidium.
The total mean time to complete posterior regeneration
through stage eight was 26.2 days.

ERIOR REGENERATION--Discussion
Some of the physical changes accompanying regeneration
warrant special attention. In Stage 1, the last segment
constricts, closing down the area of the wound, and in
so doing the parapodia are rotated toward the rear, ending
up in the orientation of the original anal cirri. Based
