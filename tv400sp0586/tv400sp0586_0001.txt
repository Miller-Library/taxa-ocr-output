Regeneration in Dorvillea
INTRODUCTION
Studies on polychaetes have included investigations
of many aspects of regeneration. Older papers such as
Berrill (1928, 1931, 1936) and Faulkner (1932) are reviewed
Many exciting dis¬
in Berrill (1951).
coveries have been made, including the elucidation of a
neurohormone gradient thought to be responsible for the
retention of polarity (Fitzharris, 1973).
Nevertheless, there remain large gaps in the infor-
mation available on polychaete regeneration. The process
has not even been looked at in many species of polychaetes.
One such species is Dorvillea moniloceras, family Dor¬
villeidae, which is found intertidally and subtidally
on the coast of Monterey, California.
In this study, the regenerative capabilities of
D. moniloceras were investigated in order to answer the
following three questions. Can both posterior and ant-
erior regeneration take place? What events take place
before full regeneration is attained? Does the position
along the body at which a worm is cut affect either the
ability to regenerate or the rate of regeneration?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was done at Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California during
April and May of 1976. A large population of D. monilo-
eras was found at the marina at Monterey Harbor,
