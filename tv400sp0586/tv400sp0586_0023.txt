Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan
However, they were generally much less active than the
anterior pieces. The parapodia of the segment just back
of the cut were rotated to the front by the constriction
of the anterior segment and occupied somewhat the posi¬
tions of palps and antennae.
Stage 3. In the third stage of regeneration a re-
tractable bulge appeared on the healed surface. As in
the original prostomium, there was no pigmentation. The
worms jerked back quickly when poked in this region, and
the level of activity observed in the worms increased
at this atage.
Stage 4. The distinctive feature of this stage
was an anterior opening to the gut, a mouth, formed in
the lower portion of the bulge. When the bulge was extended,
the opening was at the tip. At this stage, the worm
regained its normal level of activity and resumed the
characteristic behavior of an entire worm. Worms in this
stage were often observed to drag the bulge, fully extended
and pointed downward, along the bottom of the fingerbowl.
One gained the impression that feeding could be taking
place.
Stage 5. This stage was defined by the appearance
of an invagination formed in the ventral half of the bulge
at the opening to the gut. At this stage the bulge was
large enough so that the parapodia resumed their original
orientation and the "gathered"appearance disappeared.
tage 6. This stage was characterized by the forma¬
tion of rudimentary jaws posterior to the opening. The
