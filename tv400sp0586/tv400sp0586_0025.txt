Regeneration in Dorvillea

REGENERATION--Rate
ANTERIOR I
As in the case of posterior regeneration, daily
observations of the stage of development of each regen¬
erating fragment allowed calculation of rates of anterior
regeneration. Means and ranges for the duration of each
stage appear in Table 4, and variation appears in Figure 5.
RELATION BETWEEN REGENERATION RATE AND NUMBER OE SEGMENTS
It seemed possible that capacity to regenerate and
speed of regeneration might be related to the size of
the regenerating fragment. With this in mind data were
analyzed to determine the duration of Stage 1 in relation
to fragment size. Data are shown in Table 5.
The results in Table 5 suggest an inverse correlation
between the number of segments in a piece of worm and
the time it takes for regeneration to occur. Worms with
1-20 segments developed significantly more slowly (p..05)
than those with 45 or more segments, for the first stage
of regeneration. The relationship of the subsequent
stages could not be deduced because of the large die-off
of worms containing 1-20 segments.
A determination of the limiting number of segments
necessary for regeneration to occur was not the objective
of this study, although results bearing on this question
were obtained. At the time of writing, posterior regenera¬
tion was observed through the eighth stage in a worm
containing the head and only nine setigerous segments.
