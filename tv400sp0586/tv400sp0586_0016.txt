Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -17
and the worm now has a way to defacate. This markedly
increases a worm's chances of survival and full regeneration,
as evidenced by the data in Table 2A and Figure 1.
ERIOR REGENERATION--Rates
All regenerating animals were examined daily five
to seven days a week and rated as to stage, so the length
of time each animal spent at each stage was a matter of
record. The duration of each stage in posterior regeneration
for the population of experimental animals proved highly
variable (Table 3), but this variation involved only a
few individuals (Figure 3).
ANTERIOR REGENERATION--Results
The process of anterior regeneration (formation of
a new head end) was also divided into stages defined by
specific events. The stages recognized are outlined below
and sketches are shown in Figure 1.
Stages 1 and 2. The first two stages of anterior
regeneration were morphologicall similar to those recog-
nized in posterior regeneration, the differences being
behavioral; Stage 1 was characterized by an open wound
revealing tissues constricted around the orange gut; in
Stage 2 the wound was healed. The hind pieces of cut
worms retained their polarity in locomotion (they crawled
with their anterior ends first), and they consistently
righted themselves when turned on their dorsal sides.
