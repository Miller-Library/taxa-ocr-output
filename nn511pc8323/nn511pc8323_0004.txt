The assay method to detect proteolysis was the Lowry mod-
ification of the Folin test (Lowry, 1951). At 4 hour intervals,
samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixtures and treated
ml. of 10% trichloroacteic acid, TCA, to stop the reaction
and precipitate the non-hydrolgzed protein. In order to provid
maximum denaturation and precipitation of the non-hydroljzed
rotein, assay samples were incubated in TCA at room temperature
for at least 12 hours before centrifugation. Following centri-
fugation for 15 minutes at 3000 r.p.m. in an International Refri-
gerated Centrifuge, Model PR-2, the amount of Lowry-positive
droljzed casein present in the TCA supernatant was determined
