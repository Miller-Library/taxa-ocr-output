otelytie Enzymes of the Digestive Gland
of the Prosobranch Wollusc Littorina planaxis
This paper describes an in vitro analysis and part
haracterization of the proteolytic enzymes of the digestiv
planaxis, a prosobranch mollusc.

These organs appear to function principally in secreting mucus
which facilitates the passage of ingested food from the bucc
cavity to the stomach. There is also unanimity in the conclu
that no digestive enzymes are secreted, nor any food absorbed
in the intestine (Freter and Graham, 1962). The present studie.

metallic cofactors, and purification by ammonium sulfate frac
