Differences in Aggressiveness
retractions over the scoring period, signifying initiation of aggressive
behavior. Rapid retractions, however, did not appear to be a reliable
indicator for the aggressive response.
Physiological modifications such as faster neural machinery or greater
density of nonclonemate recognition sites could contribute to the more
aggressive behavior exhibited by the Clone A genotype.
That individual large A. elegantissima are more effective than
individual small animals in defending their space against several small
nonclonemates could explain how large, solitary A. elegantissima are able
to maintain positions in the middle of dense aggregations of smaller,
clonal anemones, whereas small nonclonemates are either displaced or
destroyed.
Summary
Consistent differences in aggressive behavior were found among four
distinct genotypes of Anthopleura elegantissima. These differences
could not be attributed to dissimilar weight, tentacle length, or recent
past history.
Experimental observations indicate that one large Anthopleura
elegantissima is more effective in defending its space against small
nonclonemates than a single Anthopleura elegantissima of a size similar
to its opponents.
I thank Nathan Howe for his encouragement and for reading this manu-

valuable assistance during the research.
