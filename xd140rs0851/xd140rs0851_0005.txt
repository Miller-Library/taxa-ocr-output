Differences in Aggressiveness
anemone's pedal disc was measured. Subsequent displacement was recorded
at various intervals for twenty-four hours. The water source for each
dish was moved periodically to prevent significant movement upstream
(Buchsbaum, 1968).
Forty-eight hours after the one hour scoring period began the
anemones were removed from the dishes for measurement of tentacle length,
scarring, and weight. Anemones were placed in 500 ml bowls filled with
seawater and a 1 ml dose of 0.25% (V/V in seawater) squid extract.
Anemones thus treated completely extended their tentacles. Several
relaxed tentacles were measured at random on each animal. Scars (Francis,
1973b) on the column, tentacles and acrorhagi were counted under a dissect-
ing scope. The weight of each anemone was determined either by weighing
it under seawater ("reduced weight") or measuring its dry weight.
Results
Interclonal confrontation experiment
Table II outlines a dominance hierarchy among four experimental
clones: in all its confrontations Clone A had a higher percentage of
fully open animals at the conclusion of the one hour scoring period
than did its opponents. Clone B had greater proportions of open in-
dividuals than its opponents in interactions with Clones C and D but
not when confronting Clone A. Clone C showed a higher percentage of
open animals than opponents only against Clone D, which in all cases
exhibited fewer open animals than its opponents.
Average aggressiveness scores per animal per five minute inter-
val (over twelve intervals) of the two clones in each dish (listed in
