Differences in Aggressiveness
were assigned scores positive in sign. Movements of application
(Francis, 1973b) were given a point value of +5. Displacement of an
anemone's pedal disc toward a nonclonemate was assigned a score of +4.
Swelling of acrorhagi and rapid tentacle retractions after contact with
a nonclonemate (Francis, 1973b), preliminary steps toward the movement
of application, were ascribed scores of +3 and +1 respectively.
"Submissive" responses were ranked in order of the degree of
damage that they reflect and were assigned negative values. Severely
damaged animals tend to detach their pedal discs from the substrate.
Such detachment was assigned a score of -5. Tentacle retraction is a
common response of the victim to application of ectoderm. Various degrees
of tentacle retraction were assigned the scores listed in Table I.
Moderately damaged animals often retreated from the aggressor. Dis-
placement of the pedal disc away from a nonclonemate during the scoring
period was awarded a score of â€”4. A score of O was assigned to anemones
that exhibited no response after contact with a nonclonemate. A notation
of noncontact was made for animals that did not touch animals from the
other clone. Data was collected only from animals that contacted non-
clonemates.
Twenty-four hours after placement in the dish was allowed for the
anemones to settle. Restraints separating nonclonemates were then lifted,
and the animals' behavior was observed continuously for one hour.
Cumulative aggressiveness scores were recorded at five minute intervals
for each individual of each clone.
At the end of the one hour scoring period the displacement of each
