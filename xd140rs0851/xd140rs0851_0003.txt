Differences in Aggressiveness
Dish 1
Clone A vs. Clone B
Dish 2 Clone A vs. Clone C
Dish 3
Clone A vs. Clone D
Dish 4 Clone B vs. Clone C
Dish 5 Clone B vs. Clone D
Dish 6 Clone Cvs. Clone D
Dividers were lightly greased with petroleum jelly to restrict settling
to the dish.
In the second experiment single large anemones from Clone E were
settled in the center of similar Pyrex dishes with the aid of plastic
collars. Varied numbers of small Clone A animals were settled adjacent
to the larger Clone E individual. Experiments were repeated with Clone E
individuals of different size from those of the first run.
Dish 1 1x Clone A vs. 1x Clone E
Dish 2 1 x Clone A vs. 1x Clone E
Dish 3 2 x Clone A vs. 1 x Clone E
Dish 4 2 x Clone A vs. 1 x Clone E
Dish 5 8 x Clone A vs. 1 x Clone E
For both experiments the dishes were supplied continuously with
flowing 13Â°C seawater.
Scoring procedures
Behavior was scored according to an arbitrary scale based on many
observations of interclonal interactions in the laboratory and in the
field (see Table I). Behaviors judged "aggressive" were ranked in order
of their presumed potential for inflicting damage on nonclonemates and
