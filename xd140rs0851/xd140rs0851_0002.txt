outside of Hovden Cannery, adjacent to Hopkins Marine Station; Clone D
from a piling underneith Wharf Number 2 in Monterey Harbor, Monterey.
The animals were collected from the approximate centers of dense clones
at least 0.5 square meter in area. Clones A, B, C, and E were carefully
pried off their granite substrata with a thin spatula. Clone D specimens
were gently peeled off of the wooden piling with a fingernail. Animals of
Clones A, B. C, and D had expanded oral disc diameters of 1.5 to 3 cm and
had dry weights of 0.05 to 0.30 gm; Clone E anemones had diameters of
5 to 8 cm and weighed 0.3 to 1.0 gm. All clones were located from +O.15
to +0.35 m above zero tide level. The areas where Clones A, B, C, and E
were collected were chosen for similar exposure to waveshock and sunlight.
Clone D anemones were more protected from strong light and wave action.
Specimens were maintained in glass bowls supplied with flowing
seawater at 13 C in the laboratory for at least one week prior to exper-
imentation. Continuous illumination of 3500 Lux was provided by over-
head fluorescent lights. Anemones were not fed prior to or during the
experiments. Only specimens that were attached to the glass bowls and
fully open were chosen for experimentation.
For the first experiment six 35x22x4 cm Pyrex baking dishes were ruled
with a 2 x 2 cm grid. Three thin Plexiglass dividers spaced 2 cm apart
were placed in the center of each dish. Ten members of each clone of
two clones of approximately equal size were placed on each side of the cenÂ¬
tral divider as follows:
