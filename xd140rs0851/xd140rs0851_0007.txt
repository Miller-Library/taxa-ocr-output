Differences in Aggressivenes:
(over the one hour scoring period) was not significantly correlated
with weight.
Differential size experiment
Figure 2 shows that as the reduced weight ratio of each Clone E
individual to its average surrounding Clone A anemone increases, the
difference between the aggressiveness scores of the Clone E and its
average Clone A increases linearly (r = 0.82, p £ 0.05).
Table V indicates that Clone E individuals in each case exhibited
more aggressive behavior than the average Clone A adjacent to that Clone
E animal.
Discussion
Consistent differences in aggressive behavior among four clones of
Anthopleura elegantissima were identified in the first experiment.
Several factors could explain these differences, including variations
in morphology, experience, behavior, and physiology. Significant vari-
ation in weight or tentacle length was not observed, however. Dissim-
ilarity of recent past histories was not explored since the anemones were
collected from the centers of large clones where animals were unlikely to
have had recent contact with nonclonemates.
Behavioral modifications which increase the probability of an
aggressive response developing might be expected in the more aggressive
clones. The occasional sweeping behavior observed exclusively in a few
Clone A individuals would increase the chances of contacting a nonclone¬
mate and may represent such a behavioral modification. It might be ex-
pected that the more aggressive genotypes would exhibit more rapid tentacle
