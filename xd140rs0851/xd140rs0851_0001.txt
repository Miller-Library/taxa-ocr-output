Differences in Aggressiveness
Introduction
The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima is typically found in
dense intertidal beds which may be subdivided by anemone-free trails
(Hand, 1955). Investigations by Francis (1973a) indicate that these
trails separate genetically distinct aggregations (clones) of asex-
ually reproducing anemones. Francis (1973b) has also reported anemone-
free zones separating large, solitary Anthopleura elegantissima from
adjacent clonal A. elegantissima.
An elaborate behavior pattern resulting from contact between gene-
tically distinct A. elegantissima has been studied by Francis (1973b).
She noted that a single, well settled anemone from her "Clone 2'
placed in the conter of a bowl containing several "Clone 1" A. elegan
tissima would be continually attacked and killed within ten days if not
removed. Francis (Childress, 1970) was also able to demonstrate the for-
mation of separation lines between two clones in the laboratory. She
noticed that only animals from one of the clones detached as a result
of the interclonal interaction. Such observations inspired this inves-
tigation of possible differences in aggressiveness among distinct
Anthopleura elegantissima genotypes.
Materials and Methods
General procedures
Clonal Anthopleura elegantissima specimens were collected from four
locations along the central California coast: Clone A and Clone E from
Point Pinos at Pacific Grove; Clone B from the intertidal region at
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove; Clone C from a rocky area just
