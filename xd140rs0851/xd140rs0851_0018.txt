Differences in Aggressiveness
Figure captions
Figure 1 : The difference in average aggressiveness scores per animal
per five minute interval (over the one hour scoring period)
between each clone and its opponent clone as a function of the
distance between the two opposing clones in the dominance
hierarchy. A distance of 1 indicates that the clones are
adjacent to each other, while 3 indicates that the clones
are at opposite extremes of the hierarchy.
Figure 2 : Reduced weight ratio of each Clone E individual to its
average surrounding Clone A anemone as a function of the
difference in the aggressiveness scores (per animal per
five minute interval over the one hour scoring period).
