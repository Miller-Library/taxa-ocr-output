Differences in Aggressiv
ess
Table III) were found to be significantly different (p 0.05, Mann-
Whitney U-test). These scores closely follow the dominance hierarchy
from Table I. The average points scored decrease consistently as one
descends the hierarchy from Clone A to Clone D. Table III also indi-
cates that the aggressiveness scores of the opponents steadily decrease
down the hierarchy. As the distance between two clones in the hierarchy
increases the difference in the aggressiveness scores per animal per
five minute interval (over twelve five-minute intervals) of the clones
increases linearly (r = 0.93, p£0.01 ; see Figure 1).
Scarring counts, a more objective measure of aggressive behavior,
also correspond well with the dominance hierarchy. Table IV indicates
that the number of scars inflicted by each clone on its opponents de¬
creases consistently from Clone A to Clone D. Fewer scars are inflicted
on Clone A than on the lower clones, but there is no regular decrease
as the hierarchy is descended.
The total number of rapid tentacle retractions (Francis, 1973b)
observed in the one hour scoring period for each clone in each con-
frontation did not consistently follow the dominance hierarchy. A modifi-
cation of the aggressive behavior pattern was observed in a few individuals
from Clone A. These animals tended to extend their columns, bend over
and sweep the surroundings with their tentacles.
Dry weights of individual anemones in the two opposing clones
were not significantly different in any of the confrontations; differ-
ences in tentacle length were similarly insignificant. Additionally,
