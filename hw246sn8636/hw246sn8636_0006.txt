Microalgae on Shell
(6)
Erythrocladia subintegra Rosenvinge -- In culture, thallus
discoid, up to 224um in diameter. Cells in central
region polystromatic (plates 4,5).
Lyngbya sp. -- A blue-green alga very common especially
on shells from the wave exposed coast. Often the entire
shell is covered with tufts of this alga. 139um in
length, 4um in width. Appeared colorless in all
cases (plate 6).
Pseudopringsheimia
apiculata Setchell & Gardner -- Com-
mon. Lends grass green color to many shells. Usually
epizoic on shell surface, occasionally endozoic under
protein coat of shell. Cross-section shows apiculate
tips and polystromatic growth up to 10 cells thick (67um)
(plate 7). Cells in cross-section are in vertical rows
and horizontally elongated (2 times as wide). Top view
of growth on shell surface (plates 8,9) shows areas of
monostromatic growth at the margins, including free ir-
regularly branched cells 2.2um in width and llum long.
Cells of central region of monostromatic growth from
top view are 2.7-3.Zum in diameter. Cells have single
pyrenoid, small rhizoids(?), and parietal(?) chloroplast.

FREQUENCIES OF OCCURRENCE
The results in figure 1 suggest that the wave ex¬
posed coast favors all the particular microalgae counted
with the exception of Erythrotichia carnea. These re¬
