Microalgae on Shell
(5)
observed on sterilized shells after 3 weeks. Shells
placed at low sites showed the greatest amount of
new growth for any given area. On 10 shells from
a low site near Mussel Point the following new growth was
observed: 21 Enteromorpha sp. and Ulva sp., 1 Erythro-
cladia subintegra Rosenvinge, 13 Erythrotrichia carnea
(Dillwyn) J. Agardh, 12 Feldmannia chitonicola (Saunders)
Levring filaments, and general presence of Pseudo-
pringsheimia apiculata Setchell & Gardner.
OBSERVATIONS OF FORM AND HABIT
The following observations deal with those micro-
algae where the observed form or habit was of special
interest or differed from that hitherto described.
Conchocelis rosea Batters -- Shell-boring. Common at
all observed tidal heights. The thin, transparent
shell made possible direct observation under the com¬
pound microscope. Three distinct morphological forms
were observed. 1) Thin, usually straight filaments,
2.2um in width, with occasional short side branches.
Filaments contain very elongated pink cells (plate 1).
2) Thick to thin filaments, up to 9um in width, not
straight, branching common, becoming somewhat con¬
stricted between cells and near branchings, containing
pink somewhat elongated cells (plate 2). 3) Uniformally
thick filaments, 9um in width, cells dark in color, not
elongated, 4.5um in diameter (plate 3).
