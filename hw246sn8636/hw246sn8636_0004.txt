Microalgae on Shell

pare the microalgal forms in the field with those in
culture.
An additional 256 snails were sterilized in an auto-
clave (121 C, 20 lbs. pressure, 15 minutes). These
shells were then glued with epoxy to 4x8cm wood plates
(18 shells per plate), and the wood plates were bolted
to rocks at sites denoted in table 1, during May 10-15,
1979. The shells were examined for new growth of micro¬
algae after a 2-3 week period.
ESULTS
The results of this study are presented under three
categories: 1) frequencies of occurrence, 2) new growth
on sterilized shells, and 3) observations of form and
habit.
FREQUENCIES OF OCCURRENCE
Table 2 lists the microalgae encountered in field
and culture observations. Figure 1 depicts the numbers
of particular microalgae on the shells from the wave
protected coast and wave exposed coast study areas
as determined by culture counts. Figure 2 displays
the results of culture counts to determine frequency
differences between 15°0 cultures and 22 C cultures.
NEW GROWTH ON STERILIZED SHELLS
Table 2 shows that many species of algae observed
on the shells of living snails from the field were also
