is commonly completely covered with algae. The T.
pulloides in the field are not as exposed to light
as were the sterilized shells or as are the shells of
C. limatula, thus lack of sufficient light may account
for the lack of increased algal growth. Possibly
Tricolia pulloides graze upon each other or are
grazed upon by some other organism. Though such
grazing has been described for some intertidal snails
(Eikenberry and Wickizer, 1964) it was never observed
for T. pulloides in the field or in laboratory tanks
provided with macroalgal fronds. Such behavior was
only observed when snails were confined in small
containers without any other food. Yet another ex¬
planation is that the protein coat of Tricolia's shell
may inhibit algal growth. The question of why the
live T. pulloides in the field are only rarely more
than 50% covered with algae is a perplexing one which
I am unable to explain.
OBSERVATIONS OF FORM AND HABIT
Conchocelis rosea -- The fact that this shell-boring
alga was found in Tricolia's shells is an interesting
finding in itself. Conchocelis, an alternate morpho-
logical form of various Porphyra species (Tseng and Chang,
1956; Hollenberg, 1958), may serve to insure the sur¬
vival of Porphyra during times when the intertidal
