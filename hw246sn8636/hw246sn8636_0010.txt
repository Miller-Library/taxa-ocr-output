of the three observed forms of Conchocelis in the field.
ythrocladia subintegra -- This alga has been described
from the field as monostromatic (Abbott and Hollenberg.
1976), but according to Nichols and Lissant-(1967) Ery.
throcladia subintegra in culture becomes polystromatic
with age, in agreement with this author's observations
in culture. This particular example demonstrates a
problem in present phycology, in that earlier descripÂ¬
tions of many species are based entirely on a few field
observations and often miss the morphological variability
present. This problem becomes more acute when one studies
inadequately defined taxa such as the genera and species
of the family Chaetophoraceae around the Monterey Peninsula.
Pseudopringsheimia apiculata -- Early descriptions of
many of the species of Chaetophoraceae described for
the Monterey Peninsula, including Pseudopringsheimia
apiculata, are based entirely on morphological attri-
butes observed in the field, often only on one or a
few hosts. Studies of thier habit, form, and pheno-
typic variability under a wide range of environmental
conditions have never been made. Yet, recent cultural
investigations of the family Chaetophoraceae by Wilkin-
son and Burrows (1972) and Yarish (1976) demonstrate
that serious taxonomic problems do exist in this family
due to earlier field descriptions which did not take
into account the extraordinary phenotypic plasticity
in members of this family.
