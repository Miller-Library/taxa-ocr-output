Microalgae on Shell
(2)
INTRODUCTION
An extensive survey of the epizoic and endozoic
microalgae associated with the shell of a single species
of a living marine snail has never before been carried
out. The relative abundance of Tricolia pulloides
(Carpenter, 1865) around the Monterey Peninsula,
California (Firestone, 1979) and the smooth, semi¬
transparent character of the shell offered a convenient
opportunity for beginning such a survey.
The objective of this study was to identify the
microalgae found on the shells of T. pulloides and to
investigate whether or not there existed differences
in species or quantity of microalgae on the shells be¬
tween a wave exposed coast and a wave protected coast.
This study also led to an investigation of the habit of
a green alga placed in the Chaetophoraceae, a family of
green algae not fully understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The specimens were gathered from four main study
areas on the Monterey Peninsula. Two areas, Point Pinos
and Point Joe, were on a wave exposed coast, and two
areas near Mussel Point were on a wave protected coast
(fig. 1). Three collection sites (+2.0 ft., +1.0 ft..
0.0 ft.) at each study area were selected relative
