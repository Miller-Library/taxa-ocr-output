A field survey and culture study of the microalgae
living on the shells of the intertidal prosobranch
mollusc, Tricolia pulloides (Carpenter, 1865), a-
round the Monterey Peninsula, California have identified
the microalgae commonly found growing on these shells and
have shown that some of these microalgae are in greater
abundance on shells from a wave exposed coast as comÂ¬
pared to shells from a wave protected coast. Conchocelis
rosea Batters, a shell-boring red alga not expected in
high intertidal shells, was commonly found. An encrusting
green alga identified as Pseudopringsheimia apiculata
Setchell & Gardner showed free radiating irregularly
branched marginal filaments in monostromatic regions and
horizontally elongated cells in polystromatic regions,
neither of which had been described for P. apiculata
on macroalgal hosts.
