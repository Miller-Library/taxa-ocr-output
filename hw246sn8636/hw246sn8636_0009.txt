habitat is under stress owing to intense sunlight,
high temperatures, or lack of large waves. Conchocelis
phases are more resistant to these physical stresses
than the large, blade-like Porphyra plants. These
Conchocelis filaments in Tricolia shells are at ap¬
proxiamately the same tidal height as locally occur-
ring Porphyra perforata J. Agardh.
While an enormous amount of work has been done on
the form and habit of Conchocelis in culture (Drew, 1949,
1957; Kurogi, 1953; Tseng and Chang, 1955, 1956; Hollenberg,
1958; and Dixon and Richardson, 1969), little if any
extensive work has been done with Conchocelis in the
field. The shell of Tricolia pulloides has proved to
be an excellent place to observe Conchocelis in the field.
The three distinct morphological forms observed each
correspond to similiar forms described by Tseng and
Chang (1954) and locally by Hollenberg (1958) as dif¬
ferent stages of Conchocelis. It is of interest that
Hollenberg described the Conchocelis stage of locally
occurring Porphyra perforata as free-living (not shell¬
boring) while the Conchocelis filaments in Tricolia
shells may likely represent the Conchocelis stage of
Porphyra perforata in a shell-boring situation. The
shell of T. pulloides offers an opportunity for study
of the seasonal variations, if any, in the abundance
