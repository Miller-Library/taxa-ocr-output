ding to immediate macroalgal type (table 1). A sample
20 snails was collected at each site for culture
studies, and an additional sample of 20 snails was
preserved in 5% formalin for later observation. Col-
lections were made from May 10-15, 1979 during the neap
tides of that month.
The shell of each snail collected for culture
(240 in total) was cracked and the animal removed.
All shell fragments from five snails were placed in
separate plastic petri dishes (100xl5mm) containing
.45um filter-sterilized sea water enriched with modi-
fied Provasoli's media (Provasoli, McLaughlin, and Droop,
1957); 5 drops of Ge0» solution were added to each dish
to control diatoms. Two of the four shell cultures
from each collection site were placed at 15°0 with
constant light (40 watt, cool white, 46 microeinsteins

After 6 and 9 days in culture, depending on the species,
specific microalgae were counted under a dissecting
microscope. Following the ninth day, samples of each
microalga were identified using a compound microscope
and photographed with a Nikon compound microscope
camera unit. The preserved snails were used to com¬
