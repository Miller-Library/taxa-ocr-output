Microalgae on Shell
(11)
It was within the above framework of knowledge
that this author had to work. Tables 3 and 4 illus-
trate the reasons for tenatively assigning the common
Chaetophoraceae alga seen on the shells to the genus
and species Pseudopringsheimia apiculata and also the
author's reservations about doing so. The differences
in habit between the alga on the shells and Pseudo-
pringsheimia apiculata may be due to a phenotypic
(not genotypic) difference resulting from the difference
in hosts from which the alga is being described. Yarish
(1976) concluded, "In the case of certain Chaetophoraceae
it is essential to culture the organisms to obtain
correct identification. Many species described in the
literature are probably ecophenes of a more limited
number of species." Comparative culture and field
studies of this alga and others in the Chaetophoraceae
from the Monterey Peninsula should be attempted in
order to better understand the taxonomy of this family.
