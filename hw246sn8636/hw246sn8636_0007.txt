Microalgae on Shell
(7)
sults are reasonable assuming that the exposed coast
has more dissolved oxygen and nutrients available
due to increased water turbulence.
The results in figure 2 suggest that the red algae,
Erythrocladia subintegra and Erythrotrichia carnea, and
the brown alga, Feldmannia chitonicola, are not well
adapted to warm temperatures, though E. carnea is
known from the tropics (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976).
This seems consistent with a paper by Hoek (1975) which
suggests that species of algae living abundantly in
cooler thermal regions are usually not well adapted
to live in warmer thermal regions. The results in
figure 2 may also be due at least in part to the difference
in light intensities to which the two sets of shell
cultures were exposed.
NEW GROWTH ON STERILIZED
SHELLS
New growth on the shells was surprising in view
of the short time period. These results bring up the
question of why the Tricolia pulloides in the field
are not overgrown with algae. At least 70% of the
Tricolia observed from the field were less than 50%
covered with microalgae. Another snail, however, the
limpet Collisella limatula Carpenter, often seen at the
same tidal height as the higher of the T. pulloides,
