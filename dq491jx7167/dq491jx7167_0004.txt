Brain extirpation
Brain extirpation experiments were performed by slicing off the anterior
tip of the prostomium, resulting in a small wound and little loss of tissue.
Control groups consisted of worms from which a wedge of tissue, approxi-
mately equal in volume to the tip of the prostomium, was removed from the
dorsal surface of the prostomium, just posterior to the brain. When the
supraesophogeal ganglion was removed from a group of small worms, the wounds
healed within six days, and noticeable replacement of tissue began after
thirteen days. A light band of tissue, possibly a regenerating supraesoph-
ogeal ganglion, was observed in most of the animals after nineteen days.
In another series of experiments, the brain and either the posterior
1/5 or the posterior 2/3 of caudal tissue were removed from large and small
worms. Control groups from which similar lengths of caudal tissue were
removed, were used as well. The only group surviving these operations was
the control group consisting of small worms from which the caudal ten per
cent had been removed. Approximately half of this group was alive thirteen
days after the operation, at which time all of the worms in the other groups
had died.
When resuilts of sinilarly treated groupe from different erperinents
are compared, the data is sometimes contradictory. For example, half of the
animals of indeterminate sex used in the experiment on effect of sex on
regenerative ability survived eighteen days. However, similar worms, used in
the experiment on effect of size, were all dead within sixteen days, even
though the percentage of material removed was the same as above, Similar
variation was seen in the brain extirpation experiment. The members of
