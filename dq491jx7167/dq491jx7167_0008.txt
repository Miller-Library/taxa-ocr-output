Experiments concerning the effect of the brain on caudal regeneration
have been done by several workers on N. diversicolor. In these studies
the worms were able to survive simultaneous removal of the supraesophogeal
ganglion as well as some caudal tissue, although they were not able to
regenerate any caudal segments (Clark 1960, 1961,1962), (Herlant-Meewis
1964), (Golding 1967). This contrasts with the results with Cirriformia,
from which removal of both the brain and caudal segments resulted in death.
Loss of the brain was probably not the sole cause of death however, because
animals from which only the brain was removed survived quite well. The
shock of the two simultaneous wounds may be the cause, since two of the
three control groups died within thirteen days.
According to the results of experiments in which tentacles were removed,
Cirriformia cannot survive a large loss of tentacles from one location.
Since animals lacking tentacles were found in tle field and since the tent-c
acles are exposed to injury more than any other part of the worm, the
failure of the worm to survive the loss of many tentacles is surprising.
However, the loss of a single tentacle at one time may be more likely
under natural conditions, and the ability of the animals to survive and
replace single tentacles is therefore not surprising. It is of interest,
however, that so few of the animals (1/5-1/4) were capable of replacing
the lost tentacle.
That the conditions under which the animals were handled and kept were
not the best for Cirriformia can be seen by the high mortality rate of the
animals. The fact that the animals were starved during the experiments
may be the major factor in their poor survival, although results of starving
other polychaetes show much lower mortality rates in most cases.
