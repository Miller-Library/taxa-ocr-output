two control groups died within eleven days, whereas over half of the animals
in a third control group were healthy fourteen days after amputation.
IDENTIFICALION  REEENERADON
Regeneration in the polychaete Nephtys is identifiable by the lighter
color of the regenerated segments (Clark and Clark 1962). C. spirabrancha
were found in the field having posterior segments distinctly lighter than
the rest of the worm, suggesting that regeneration had taken place. However,
animals kept in the laboratory became bleached from their original dark
green color to light brown. Regenerating pygidia were the same light brown
color. It is therefore possible that segments were regenerated in some
instances, and went unnoticed because they were the same color as the older
segments. This possibility seems unlikely however, since no difference
in size or parapodial development of caudal segments was observed.
Tentacles
The tentacles of C. spirabrancha arise from two general areas: a band
running laterally across the dorsal side of the animal between the fourth
and fifth segments, and singly, from the dorsal side of the notopodia, at
apparently random intervals down the length of the animal.
C. spirabrancha were found in the field having no tentacles between
the fourth and fifth segments. These were kept as experimental animals,
and died within ten days. In a similar laboratory experiment, all tentacles
between the fourth and fifth segments were removed from thirty worms, with a
small scissors. These animals were dead after seven days.
In another experiment, one tentacle, the anterior-most blood filled
tentacle on the right side of the prostomium, was removed from twenty-five
worms. The amputation resulted in the blood being squeezed from the
tentacle stub remaining after amputation. Within two days, many of these
