stubs had filled with blood. After nine days, those tentacles which had
regenerated had reached the length (15-20 mm.) of many of the intact
tentacles, and as do the older intact tentacles, had developed white and
green portions. After twenty-seven days, five of the ten surviving animals
had regenerated tentacles, which were twenty to twenty-two millimeters in
length.
Discussion
A wide range of caudal regeneration rates has been found in this
study of C. spirabrancha. However, even the fastest regeneration time is
much slower than those reported for Cirrineris, even though the Cirrineris
were kept in bowls of sea water and presumably starved (Stoned 1935), as
were the C. spirabrancha in these experiments. The fantastic regenerative
ability of Dodecaceria, a member of the same family as Cirriformia, provides
an even greater contrast to the observed slow regeneration rates.
It is not known if number of segments or size is a good indication of
the age of the animal but as can be seen in Text-figs. 1 and 2, there does
appear to be correlations between the size of the animal, and ability to
survive wounding, rate of regeneration, and ability of different regions to
regenerate.
As also noted (Text-fig. 2b), an axial gradient of regenerative ability
may be present in small animals, since regenerative rate increases with
the amount of tissue removed, which is in agreement with the results of
Golding (1967). However, it must be noted that my data measures the length
of time required to regenerate a pygidium, whereas Golding measured the
number of segments regenerated in a given time.
The results of the two experiments on larger animals show better
