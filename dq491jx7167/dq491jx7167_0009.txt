Another possible factor contributing to the high mortality rate might
be the practice of keeping the animals clumped in groups of up to thirty
worms. This close contact probably causes the spread of infection from
decaying animals to healthy animals. As a check on this possibility, intact
worms were added to three groups of animals from which caudal tissue had
been removed. With only one exception, all the intact animals had died of
infection ty the time the amputated animals had died.
All these factors, and probably several others, add up to great
ambiguity regarding the regenerative ability of Cirriformia. Where experi-
mental groups were duplicated, results are sometimes contradictory. However,
it can only be hoped that the groups compared to each other to yield the
conclusions, having been carried out at the same time, and using the same
techniques, have fewer variable differences and therefore more validity
than those contradictory results of experimental groups operated on at
different times.
Summary
1. Regeneration of the tip of the prostomium, the tentacles, and the
pygidium occurs in C. spirabrancha.
2. Regeneration of caudal segments may occur, but at a rate too slow
to be observed during the available time period. Regeneration of the
supraesophogeal ganglion may also occur.
3. There appears to be, in general, greater capacity for wound healing
and faster pygidial regeneration in smaller animals than in larger animals.
4. The presence of an axial gradient of regenerative ability in
small animals, and certain areas of increased wound healing ability and
