the wound, and by swelling of the gut. It was reasoned that the most
critical period for the occurance of infection was before this process
of wound closure was complete. Therefore, following the operations, the
animals were kept for fifteen or thirty minutes in a container of sea
water to which had been added 100,000 i.u./1. of penicillin and 100 mg./1.
of streptomycin. The animals were then moved to aquaria containing 13-15Â°0.
sea water, in which groups of twenty-five to thirty animals were maintained
without feeding for the duration of the experiments.
Results
Wound closure, appearance of regeneration
As stated above, wound closure is accomplished by constriction of
muscles and expansion of the gut of the segments nearest the wound. This
process is similar to findings with other polychaetes. If a wound has
become well healed, the last segment is rolled inward posteriorly, providing
a small, smooth opening for the gut.
The first signs of regeneration appear in ten to twenty days in smaller
(40-60 mm) animals, and within sixteen days in larger (70-100 mm.) animals.
At this time a small bulb of tissue can be seen on the posterior surface
of the last segment, ventral to the anal opening. Within six more days,
in both large and small animals, the pygidium has acquired the size and
shape of a normal pygidium. In no case was concrete evidence of regeneration
of segments found in these experiments.
Sex
An experiment was carried out to determine if ability to regenerate were
affected by the sex of the animal. However, the only identifiable external
