regenerative ability in larger worms is indicated by results of several
experiments.
5. The conditions under which these experiments were conducted were
probably not best suited for survival and regeneration of C. spirabrancha.
Contradictory results were sometimes obtained from duplicate experiments.
Therefore the results of these experiments cannot be regarded as conclusive
proof of the conclusions drawn from them, although further experimentation
may reveal the causes of the discrepancies.
