feature distinguishing sexes in C. spirabrancha is the pale yellow coloring
of males filled with sperm. Using this feature as a criterion for separ-
ating large animals into two groups, one of "obvious males" and another of
animals of indeterminate sez, the caudal twenty per cent of the animals
was removed. Although all of the "obvious males" had died within eight
days, more than half of the animals of indeterminate sex were still healthy
after eighteen days. One member of this group was still alive and healthy
at the end of the thirty-three day observation period, although there was
no evidence of any regeneration.
Size
To determine if size affects regenerative ability, animals of indeter-
minate sex were divided into three groups: thick animals seventy to one
hundred millimeters long, thin animals seventy to one hundred millimeters
long, and animals forty to sixty millimeters in length. Within sixteen
days, all of the longer animals were dead or decaying. Over half of the
shorter worms, however, were still alive and healthy after twenty days,
and were beginning to regenerate pygidia.
Region of cut
It has been found in work on Nereids that there is an axial gradient
of regenerative potential (Golding 1967). To determine if such a gradient
exists in C. spirabrancha, three experiments were conducted. In the first,
large animals of indeterminate sex were cut into six sections. Although
no regeneration was found, there were differences in length of survival
times for different areas of the animal (Text fig.la). In the second exper-
iment, the posterior 1/10, 1/5, and 2/3 respectively of three groups of
larger worms was removed. Cuts were made in the same three locations on
