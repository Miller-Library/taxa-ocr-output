Introduction
It was observed that two local species of hermit crabs,
Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanus, were active in
much greater numbers at night than during the day. In order
to determine whether the crabs move at different speeds at
different times of day the following experiments were carried
out.
Materials and Methods
Concentric circles were laid out on a piece of sheet
rock at distances of 20, 30, 40, and 50. cm. and it was
placed at the bottom of a pond in approximately 10 inches
of sea water. Ten Pagurus granosimanus and ten Pagurus
samuelis of approximately equal size were then selected.
A small weighted cage (plastic strawberry carton) was
used to retain the Pagurus in the center of the circles until
the start of the experiment. One minute after the investi-
gator had left the pool the cage was raised using a string
attached to a pole. The time required for five of the ten
crabs to pass out of the 50 cm. circle was then recorded.
In a small number of cases one of the crabs clung to the cage
and was carried out of the circles. When this happened the
crab which was carried away was ignored, and the time required
