C
for five crabs to leave the 50 cm. circle was taken as usual.
The trials were run on even hours (e.g. 1400, 1600, etc.)
at various times over a period of 6 days with trials every
two hours over a 24 hour period on the last day. Two runs
were generally taken with each species at each trial. The
species were alternated on these runs. The same crabs were
used throughout the 6 days of the trials. Night observations
were made by using a ruby bulb, although in some cases the
pond was illuminated by light from nearby windows.
Results
The combined data from all runs (fig. 3) seems to show
that the crabs move more slowly at night than during the day,
but the otherwise fairly regular trend is interrupted at
2200 when the time required for the crabs to get out of
the 50 cm. circle falls off rather sharply. The data for
the two species considered individually (figures 1 and 2)
are much less regular than the combined data, although' in
both cases the same trend of slow movement at night and
faster movement by day is evident.
Discussion
Figures 1, 2, and 3 all show essentially the same
trend, with the crabs moving slower at night than during
the day. The reason for the interruption of this trend
