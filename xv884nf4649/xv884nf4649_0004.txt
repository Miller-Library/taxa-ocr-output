at 2200 is at this time unknown. Temperature probably does
not play a major role in determining these activity patterns,
since the greatest activity occurs at night (2200) after the
water has cooled considerably. Also, the rate of movement
begins to speed up in the morning while the temperature is
still falling. Intensity of illumination may well prove to
be a major factor in determining how fast the crabs move.
In order to draw any conclusions about the possible effects
of light or physiologisal rhythms on the rate of locomotion
in Pagurus a much larger number of trials would be required,
preferably under conditions where temperature and illumination
could be controlled.
Summary
Data are presented on the rate of locomotion of Pagurus
granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis at different times of the
day and night. There appears to be a general tendency for
the crabs to slow down at night, but there is an unusual in-
crease in the speed with which the crabs move at 2200. More
experiments under controlled conditions are needed.
