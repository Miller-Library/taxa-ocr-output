oxygen evolutionby algae on the shells, the shells were scraped and the
animals kept in the dark. After the respiratory measurement was comple-
ted, each animal was removed from its shell, blotted and weighed. These
same individuals were then used to determine the amount of glycogen
present in the entire body. The whole animal was homogenized in 2mls.
of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the glycogen was
precipitated from the trichloroacetic acid supernatant by the addition
of an equal volume of 95% ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in
Amls. of water and the carbohydrate content determined using the phe¬
nol-sulfuric acid method of Dubois (1956).

The results of measurements of oxygen consumption are represented
in Table 1 and glycogen content in shown in Table 2.
The findings show a difference in metabolic activity and glyco¬
gen stores in animals from the two intertidal locations. The results
show that the higher forms have higher glycogen stores and lower meta¬
bolic activity than the animals from the lower intertidal area. Thes
combination ofthscould be the critical factor permitting maintenance
of the animal between feedings. Measurements of glycogen in the higher
group also shows a somewhat greater range, as is reflected in the higher
standard deviation. A greater degree of variation in glycogen content
would be anticipated if life between feedings is dependent upon the use
of glycogen stores. The higher mean glycogen content in the limpets
from higher portions of the intertidal also suggests an increased
storage potential in these animals.
The glycogen and respiratory data also permit calculation of the
