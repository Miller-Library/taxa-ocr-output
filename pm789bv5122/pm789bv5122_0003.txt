Of the several species of Acmaea found in the intertidal of Mon-
terey County, A. scabra (Gould 1846) occupies the highest zone on the
rocks (Hewatt 1935). It ranges between the tide levels of plus two
and plus six feet. Hewattihasyobserved, and my own observations have
confirmed, that these limpets make excursions in search of food only
when submerged or amidst heavy wave action. Lower populations move
more often, and more regularly, than do populations located at higher
tide levels. For example, individuals of the higher populations have
been observed to remain immotile for periods up to three days.
In April and May, 1966, studies were carried out at the Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California, to
determine what physiological factors enable these populations to sustain
themselves over prolonged periods between feeding. Two parameters were
investigated; oxygen consumption and glycogen stores. These parameters
were chosen in conjunction with the hypothesis that a decrease in meta-
bolic activity and larger stores of glycogen may allow the animals to
survive under conditions that preclude frequent feeding.
MTTHODS
All specimens were collected off Mussel Point, Pacific Grove,
California. Individuals were taken from two different parts of the
intertidal; below plus two feet and above plus six feet. Within twen¬
ty minutes after collection, individual animals were placed in a sep¬
arate water-filled jar and their oxygen consumption measured for a three
hour period by the Winkler method (Welsh & Smith,1949, pg.146). The
water temperature remained constant at 11 C. In order to minimize
