WHITE, T. JEFFERY (Hopkins Marine Sta., Pacific Grove, Calif.,
USA.) Metabolic activity and glycogen stores of two distinct popula-
tions of Acmaea scabra (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia). The
Veliger
Populations of the limpet Acmaea scabra found high in the intertidal
remain immotile and do not feed for long periods of time, while lower pop-
ulations move and feed more frequently. Studies were carried out to deter-
mine whether any nutritional or metabolic adaptations enable these high pop-
ulations to sustain themselves over these prolonged periods between feeding.
Comparisons were made of glycogen conte and respiratory rate between two
populations; one at plus two feet in the intertidal, the other at plus six feet.
It was demonstrated that the higher populations have greater glycogen stores
and lower respiratory rates than the lower populations. The differences
could revresent an adaptation to survive for long periods between feeding.
