minimum time these higher populations could survive between feedings,
if glycogen were the sole respiratory substrate. Assuming six moles
of oxygen consumed per mole of glucose utilized, this could permit
submerged maintenance for sixty hours. The lower population of Acmaea
scabra, with its higher respiratory activity and lower glycogen store,
could only maintain itself for seventeen hours. Since Baldwin (1966)
has found that the aerial respiration rate in A. scabra is several times
less than the submerged rate, the above values are certainly minimal
for aerially-breathing limpets.
Lower metabolic activity and higher glycogen content are not the
only characteristics of high populations that suggest adaptations for
survival in the higher portions of the intertidal. Nawatt (1940) has
observed that the shells of Acmaea scabra from higher intertidal areas
are higher and thicker, while the shells of this species living in low,
moist areas are thinner and flattened. In addition, the study of Jessee
(1966) indicates that A. scabra of the higher intertidal shows a greater
tendency to home than A. scabra found in the low intertidal. Animals
with a strong homing tendency present a greater irregularity of shell
shape that is complementary to the home site. The resulting better fit
of animal to substratum may decrease susceptibility to desiccation.
A third adaptation of the higher forms, shown by the study of Hardin
(1966), demonstrates that higher populations of A. scabra can withstand
greater temperatures than populations lower in the intertidal.
