6 and 9. Cotyledons 1 and  in females 10 to 11.5
m long show no significant differences from one anÂ¬
other, and no significant changes in size during brood
developement. In contrast cotyledons 2 and 3, while
they do not differ significantly from one another,
show a clear increase in size during developement
(significant at the.01 level).
Observation on 18 individuals showed that the
cotyledons shrink to a length of 0.2 to O.1 mm upon
release of the brood. They become nipple-like, and
appear somewhat retracted into the basal ridge though
they cannot be extracted when pulled with forceps and
do not extend when distilled water is applied. They
persist in this shrunken condition until the next
molt.
Properties and possible function of the cotyledons
in P. scaber
Schobl (1880) proposed that the cotyledons served
a nutritive function. Verhoeff (1920) disagreed and
suggested a respiratory function instead. He further
suggested an antibacterial action of the brood fluid.
Personal observation leads me to suggest the cotyledons
may play a part in anchoring the young, preventing
them from being lost from the brood pouch. They may
also function in maintaining the proper amount of
