fluid in the brood pouch.
There are several properties of the cotyledons
and tho rolated brood fluid which are pertainent to a
discussion of possible function. Permeability of the
cotylodons to water and small molecules was tested
with solutions of Nacl ranging from 0% to 10%, at
2.5% intervals. Several drops of each solution were
placed in the brood pouches of females from which oosteg-
ites and young had been removed such that the fluid
just covered the cotyledons. The cotyledons show an
increase in turgidity when exposed to tap water (0%).
There was a noticable reduction in turgidity when the
saline solutions were applied. There is not as great
a difference between any of the saline solutions as
there was between tap water and the 2.5% saline.
The increase in turgidity with tap water and the loss
of turgidity with exposure to the saline solutions
demonstrates that the ventral side of the
female is permeable to water. The thin walled
cotyledons are the most likely permeable structures.
In another experiment an aqueous solution of
Fast Green dye was injected into the body cavity of
an otherwise undisturbed female. A very small amount
of the dye was introduced using a glass micro-syringe
at the base of the last peraeoped, and care was taken
to prevent any leakage. After 20 minutes the female
