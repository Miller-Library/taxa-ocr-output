Bacteriostatic activity of marsupial fluid
A fow experiments were run to test Verhooff's
(1920) hypothesis that the marsupial fluid may have
an inhibitory effect on bacterial or fungal growth.
100 ml of a nutriant medium was made up of the following
ingredients: 0.5 % Difco yeast extract, .05 % Mgso,
7H,0, .02 % Na,HPo,, .01% kcl, .006 % Cacl, (added
in solution), .003% Fecl,-6H,O (also added in solution),
and 2 Difco agar in tap water brought to a pH of 6.9
with 10 ml 2M Tris HCl and.5 ml Tris base yielding
a final 100 ml solution. An incubating broth was also
made using the above formula without the agar. Sub-
rate from the Mussel Point habitat of P. scaber
was finely ground, then diluted with tap water to one
tenth concentration. Iml of this solution was added
to 5 ml to the agar medium and plated on a petri dish.
This was allowed to incubate at 35°0 for 24 hours.
Colonies from this plate were used to innoculate five
agar-less nutriant baths which were also allowed to
incubate for 24 hours at 35°0 until there was a percep-
table cloudy appearance to the fluid. These cultures
were used to innoculate a set of plates using ! mi
of broth with 5 ml of agar medium. Two plates were
