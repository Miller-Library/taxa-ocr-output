Cotyledons in isopods. page 1
Occurence and appearance of cotylodons
Specimens of Porcellio scabor americanus repre-
sonting all stages of the life history were examined.
Cotyledons were found to occur only in brooding females.
No traces aro present in males or in any non-brooding
females except those from which the brood has just
departed. Four cotyledons are present (figure 1).
They arise from the centers of ridges which run trans-
versly across the centers of thoracic segments three
through six. They are hollow, finger-like evaginations
of the body wall which are soft and pliable. Inter-
nally they are filled with loose connective tissue
which allows fluid circulation; their surfaces bear
no observable pore openings (Akahira, 1956).
Cotyledons were examined in brooding females in
eight species of Oniscoidea (figures 1 through 5).
Porcellio scaber americanus, P. dilatatus, and Arma-
dilloniscus lindahli all have similar cotyledons;
four are present, one per segment. Cotyledons on P.
dilatatus seem larger than those on P. scaber whereas
those on A. lindahli seem shorter. Philoscia richard-
sonae has nine cotyledons, one on the third thoracic
segment, two on the sixth thoracic segment, and three
each for thoracic segments four and five. The cotyl-
edons appear smaller in diameter yet somewhat longer
