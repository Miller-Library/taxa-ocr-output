Cotylodons in isopods. page 11
from turgid and oroct to flacid, lying flat against
tho roof of tho brood pouch. This variability in the
sizo and shape of tho structuros makos it doubtful
that thoy are of major importance in directly retaining
the young. The author has never soen any regular ori-
entation of the young around the cotyledons or regular
orientation of the cotyledons within the brood sack.
However any mucus secreted into the brood sack, for
what ever purpose, may be an indirect aid in retaining
the young due to its natural viscosity and adhesive-
noss.
Water balance
Ten animals were maintained in small jars for
two to three days, with their normal laboratory sub¬
stratum but also with standing water in the jars making
a 100% relative humidity environment. These animals
showed normal variability in cotyledon turgidity when
compared with the population in the normal laboratory
environment. Desiccated animals exposed to between
35 and 15 % relative himidity show a shriveling of
the cotyledons without a noticable shortening. The
cotyledons shrink and presumably lose their function
after release of the young. The shrinking corresponds
to the release of the young, and the end of the re¬
quirements for the marsupial fluid. The high degree
