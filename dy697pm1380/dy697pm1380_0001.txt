Cotylodons in isopods. pa
Introduction
The marsupium of the brooding females of Porcellio
scaber Latreille contains four soft-walled processes
which emerge from the midventral body wall on thoracic
segmonts 3 to 6 inclusive. The processes have been
called cotyledons, and their morphology and position
have been well documented by Akahira (1956). The
existance of the structures was noted by earlier workers
(eg. Schöbl, 1880; Verhoeff, 1920; Heeley, 1911),
and some have speculated on their possible function.
The present studies were directed toward extending
present knowledge of the distribution of these struc-
tures in the Oniscoidea, and gaining further insight
on their function.
All isopods studied were collected in Monterey
County, California. P. scaber americanus Arcangeli
were collected from under and within a rotting log in
a shady area on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove and from
moist leaf mulch in upper Carmel Valley. Identifi-
cation to subspecies was checked by Dr. M. A. Miller,
University of California, Davis. The animals were
maintained in the laboratory in covered plastic buckets
containing moist Monterey pine leaf litter and wood
chunks at temperatures of 20-25°0 and a relative hum-
idity of 65-75%. Porcellio dilatatus Brandt and
