than those of P. scaber. Alloniscus porconvexus and
A. cornutus both have 12 cotyledons regularly arranged
with three por segment. They are more similar to the
cotylodons of Philoscia than to those of P. scaber.
Armadillidium vulgare has ten structures, two per
segment for the end segments of the marsupium, and
three per segment for the two middle segments. These
structures are extremely different from the cotyledons
of the previously mentioned species in that they are
balloon-like rather than finger-like projections.
Their surface occupies a large part of the surface
of the roof of the brood pouch, yot they seem to arise
from the same points of attachment as those of the
preceeding species. Ligia occidentalis appears to
lack cotyledons completely.
Cotyledon size in relation to body size and stage of
developement of the brood in Porcellio scaber
Sixty brooding females of P. scaber americanus
ranging in length from 7 mm to 11.5 mm were examined.
Length of each cotyledon was measured to the nearest
O.5 mm. The results (figure 6) show there is a direct
relationship between body length and cotyledon length.
Variability between individuals was such that adjacent points
on the same curves are not significantly different
at the .05 level, but most points one or more places
