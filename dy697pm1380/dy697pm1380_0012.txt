made por nutrient bath and 20 embryos wet with mar-
supial fluid were placed on each dish using a different
female for each plate. The plates were incubated at
35°0 for 21 hours in 100% humidity at which time a
good growth of bacteria was evident. There was no
observable bacteriostatic effect by the fluid or embryos
for the substrate sampled or the medium tested.
Respiration
The cotyledon membrane is highly permeable to
water, and as a general rule membranes permeable to
water are permeable to gasses. For this reason it
is quite possible the cotyledons function as a site
for oxygen exchange. However, no experiments were
performed to test Verhoeff's (1920) hypothesis.
Summary
Brooding females in 7 out of 8 species of onis¬
coidean isopods examined exhibited cotyledons or re¬
lated structures. Diagrams are presented showing their
form and position. Porcellio scaber americanus, P.
dilatatus, and Armadilloniscus lindahli all have four
cotyledons, one on each of four segments making up the
brood pouch. Philoscia richardsonae has nine coty-
ledons, while Alloniscus perconvexus and A. cornutus
both have twelve. Cotyledons are arranged in single,
in double or in triple on the brood pouch segments.
