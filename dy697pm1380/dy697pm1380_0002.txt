Cotylodons in isopods. page 3
Ratzonburg and Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille) were
collected in upper Carmel Valley from under moist leaf
litter. Ligia occidentalis Dana was collected from
a protected beach on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove.
All three species were examined on the day of collecÂ¬
tion. Philoscia richardsonae Holmes and Gay, Arma-
dilloniscus lindahle (Richardson), Alloniscus percon-
vexus Dana, and Alloniscus cornutus Budd and Lund
were collected by James Moore from the west beach on
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove. These four species were
preserved in 70% alcohol prior to examination; all
other animals were studied in a living state.
Animals in which cotyledons were to be examined
were placed ventral side up in a plasticine clay trough
moulded to match the width of the animal. The animal
was secured by placing insect pins across the body
anterior and posterior to the marsupium and embedding
both pin ends in the sides of the trough. The cotyl-
edons were exposed by first removing the legs and
oostogites with forceps, then either washing the em-
bryos out with fresh water or picking them out with
forceps. Measurement of cotyledons were taken using
an ocular micrometer on a dissecting microscope.
All drawings except figure 5 were made with a camera
lucida.
