was oxaminod in the normal way and green colored mucus
was found in the brood puuch and around the cotyledons.
This tost demonstrated the outward permeability of
moloculos other than water.
Drops of marsupial fluid removed from tho brood
sacks of females with young in all stages were examined
by placing the dropson glass slides. They showed a
cloudy appearance and upon evaporation left white spots
which contained some crystals but represented predom-
inately a white film. Young taken from the brood
pouch show a great deal of adhesion to each other
and to other things. These observations suggest the
fluid is somewhat more complex than a simple salt
solution. Verhoeff (1920) and others have mentioned
'albuminous' materials in the marsupial fluid.
Nourishment
Verhoeff (1920) grew brooding females on a sand
substratum without feeding them anything during the
brood period. Several females were able to produce
normal broods. From this evidance he claimed to have
refuted Schobl's (1880) suggestion that the cotyledons
function in nutrition of the young. Yim (1973) has
shown an increase in both organic and inorganic content
of the brood in P. scaber americanus during develope-
ment. That the young increase in organic and inorganic
