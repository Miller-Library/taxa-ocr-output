content suggosts that thore must bo a source of mater¬
ials oxtornal to tho embryo. Possibly death and decom¬
position of somo of tho young originally presont in a
givon brood could both reduce crowding and provide
a source of nutrition already within the brood pouch.
However, I have seen very few decomposing young in
examinations of the brood sacks of more than 60 Por-
cellio females. Two other possible sources of nutri-
ith
ents are,the external environment or materials diffusing
through the roof of the brood pouch. Active uptake
of nutrition from the environment in a way other than
through the mother seems doubtful especially in terres-
trial species. Diffusion across the cotyledon mem-
brane can occur as is shown by the dye and the water
experiments. Also a mucdus-like substance is found
within the brood pouch and along the cotyledons which
may be of some use in nourishment. It seems likely
that whereas the female may not actively nurse the
young, she may suppliment their yolk supply. This
would yield more room in the brood sack to allow for
a larger number of eggs at the begining of developement.
Anchoring larvae in place
The states of the cotyledons in brooding females
held in the laboratory under more or less constant
conditions varies a great deal; cotyledons ranged
