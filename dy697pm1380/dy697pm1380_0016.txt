Fig. 6. Relation of cotyledon size to body length in
brooding females of Porcellio scaber americanus.
Vertical bars show 95% confidence limits of the means.
Cotyledons are numbered 1-1 in order from anterior to
posterior. Black triangles on the horizontal axis
show actual mean body length for the population sample
of each size class; verticle lines show the limits
for each size class. Means ranges and standard devi-
ations etc. appear in Appendi A.
