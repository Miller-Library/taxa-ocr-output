Cotylodons in isopods. page 6
romoved are significantly difforont at the.05 level.
Verhooff (1920) romoved all the embryos from the
brood pouch of female Porcellio scabor and maintained the fe-
males in the laboratory. He recorded no change in
with time
cotyledon length,and so concluded that the cotylodons
do not change size during brooding as was suggested
by Sch√∂bl (1880). Verhoeff also presented an outline
for recognizing stages in developement for the young
in the marsupium. All embryos still within the embry-
onic membrane are placed in one class, and the period
between emergance from the extraembryonic membrane
and release from the brood pouch is divided into four
larval stages. Also the characteristics defining
his stages are a set of continuous variables, eg.
relative length of the first segment of the antennae.
In the present study I found a larger number of females
with young still within the embryonic membrane than
with hatched young in the larval stages. I have there-
fore made use of the scale shown in figure 7. The
stages used here are more exactly defined than Verhoeff's
since I used the first appearence of a characteristic
to mark the beginings of a new stage.
Information on the cotyledon size in relation to
brood stage, for the 60 brooding females of P. scaber
americanus mentioned earlier, is presented in figures
