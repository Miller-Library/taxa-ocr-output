INTRODUCTION
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phyllochaetopterus prolifica : Exact'>Phyllochaetopterus prolifica</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chaetopteridae : Exact'>(Chaetopteridae)</span> is a
sedentary polychaete occurring in dense colonies of highly
branched tubes (Potts, 1914). Like other Chaetopteridae,
its body is divided into three distinct and highly differ¬
entiated regions (Figure 1).
The external morphology of the species was investi¬
gated and described by Potts (1914), and also by Berkeley
and Berkeley (1952).
Work done on closely related species includes that
done by Barnes (1964, 1965), who investigated tube building
and feeding in Chaetopteridae. Extensive regeneration stud¬
ies on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chaetopterus variopedatus : Exact'>Chaetopterus variopedatus</span> were carried out by Berrill
(1928) and Faulkner (1932). The possibility of regeneration
as a means of asexual reproduction for Phyllochaetopterus
was discussed by Potts (1914), who suggested autotomy as a
cause for the multiple occupancy of their tubes. However,
Potts did not document his statements.
This paper investigates various aspects of the biology
of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica: its methods of tube irriga¬
tion and feeding, the functional morphology of the palps, its
methods of asexual reproduction and regeneration, and aspects
of its sexual forms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Colonies of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica were collected
during April and May from three areas: the floats at the Monterey
marina, the pilings at Monterey Wharf #2, and the kelp beds off

Hovden Cannery. Several of these colonies were wired to sty¬
rofoam and were floated in their natural orientation in running
sea water aquaria. Parts of these colonies were periodically
removed for experimentation; otherwise they remained undisturbed,
Other colonies were dissected immediately after collection.
Removal of individuals from natural tubes and their
placement into plastic or glass tubes were carried out as described
by Barnes (1965). The artificial tubes were kept in petri dishes
or finger bowls in running sea water, and were observed with
dissecting and compound microscopes. Plastic tubes were Intra¬
medic Polyethylene Tubing with internal diameters of .045 inches
and variable lengths. Glass tubes were 0.9-1.1 mm in diameter
and 100 mm in length.
Observations of currents and feeding were made using
carmine particles, the diatom <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nitzschia longissima : Exact'>Nitzschia longissima,</span> and the
green alga punalieila tertiolecta to trace water movement. These
were suspended in sea water filtered through a Millipore filter,
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. General Description
The body of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica is divided into
three distinct regions (Figure 1). The anterior region is cream¬
colored or light tan and contains ten to twelve setigerous
segments. The rounded prostomium, which has two lateral eye¬
spots, is surrounded by the peristomial collar and lips. Paired
palps and antennae arise at the base of the prostomium.
The palps are approximately equal to the anterior region
of the body in length. Their coloration varies from tan to
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
-4-
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
reddish-brown. They are attached dorsally, anterior to the
antennae. Directly anterior to the point of attachment, the
dorsal and ventral surfaces are rotated 30-45° relative to the
rest of the body; the ventral surfaces are thus tilted toward
the midline of the body. The dorsal surfaces are rounded and
crenulated; the ventral surfaces have two grooves which run
the length of the palps: a shallow, ciliated furrow which car¬
ries particles outward, and a deep, ciliated trough which travel
particles toward the mouth (Figure 2). The end of each palp
is slightly knobbed. They can be held in three different posi¬
tions: extended in front of the body, tucked back along the
dorsal surface, or tightly coiled adjacent to the peristomial
collar.
A ciliated, dorsal groove originates at the base of the
palps and runs the length of the body. Food and fecal pellets
move along it to the mouth and palps from more posterior regions.
The neuropodia of the anterior region have simple setae
and are used for locomotion. The fourth setigerous segment
contains a large,dentate spine used for cutting. Whereas most
of the dorsal surface of this region is covered with cilia,
the ventral surface is unciliated and secretes the tube material
(Barnes, 1965).
The median region is greenish-gray and includes three
to seventeen segments. The neuropodia are short ridges with
uncini which are used to brace the individual against the tube
wall. The noto- and neuropodia are covered with cilia, as is
much of the dorsal surface of the median region. Between the
lobes of the trilobed, foliaceous notopodia there is a loop
Bloom, Bowers,
Cullenward
Biology of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Phylloch
lined</span> with large, flagellum-like membranelles; their beat
draws water posteriorly through the loops. The dorsal groove
passes under the medial loop and widens posterior to each noto¬
podium, forming a cupule. A small (0.15-0.20 mm), clear ball
made of mucus secreted by the medial loop rotates in the cupule.
The balls catch and tightly pack particles which are driven
past them by the beating membranelles. The medial loop period¬
ically spreads apart, and the balls move forward along the dorsal
groove to the mouth where they are ingested (Barnes, 1965).
The posterior region is dark green and has a highly
variable number of segments, never exceeding forty-five. Each
notopodium is elongate and has a ciliated tip from which protrudes
one seta. The bilobed neuropodial flaps have uncinal plagues
which are used to brace the animal against the tube. This region
is used primarily for locomotion and stability.
The asexual form of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. prolifica</span> inhabits large, dense
clumps of twisted, weakly annulated tubes. These tubes consist
of a parchment-like substance which is deposited in layers
(Barnes, 1965). Older sections of tubes are opaque and thickened,
whereas sections of new growth are thin, translucent, and more
regularly annulated. Areas of new growth can expand to accom¬
modate additional internal layering.
The colonies have a matted base of tightly packed tubes
which is attached to a substrate. The tubes radiate from the
substrate and are frequently and irregularly branched, especially
near the base. A high degree of interconnection exists between
tubes, and it is possible that the entire colony has arisen from
the extensive growth and branching of one or a few tubes. The
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
-6-
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
clumps tend to have an even upper boundary with the majority
of tubes opening at this surface.
The tubes range in diameter from .5-1.2 mm, and are
inhabited by as many as twelve individuals in a one-foot section.
Individuals in the tubes often build transverse partitions
between each other. These opaque white partitions contain two
holes made by the modified fourth setiger. It is presumed
that the fourth setiger is also used to make the small pores
which appear irregularly along the sides of the tubes.
B. Irrigation and Feeding
For thirty-seven tubes, there was an average of one
animal in every five centimeters of tube (r=0.84, p(.01,Figure 3).
The number of pores in a tube was counted by constricting
one end with cotton thread, gently forcing water into the other
end with a syringe, and counting the number of leaks. These
were unevenly spaced, but they averaged one to every 3.3 centi¬
meters of tube (r=0.73, p(.01,Figure 4). There was an average
of 1.7 pores per animal (r=0.74, p«.01, Figure 5). All slopes.
had 95% confidence limits which did not include zero as a pos¬
sible slope (Sokal and Rohlf, 1968).
P. prolifica filters particles from the irrigation water
using the mucus ball method described earlier. Animals were
always seen producing mucus balls with all except the first
foliaceous notopodia, unless the animals were doubled over
or passing a tube-mate.
The balls average 0.15-2.0mm in diameter when passed
forward to the mouth. When three animals were placed in con¬
centrations of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nitzschia : Exact'>Nitzschia</span> which ranged from 10'to 10 cells per
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
Biology of Phyllochaetopte
ml, the time taken for ball formation was significantly less
at higher concentrations (p(.001, Figure 6).
Many of the particles which passed through a foliaceous
parapodium were not caught in the ball immediately behind it.
Water which passed by seven or eight balls still carried par¬
ticles. Some of these were caught in the dorsal groove in the
posterior region and passed forward.
Carmine particles moved through the transparent foregut
at about 2 mm/min. Thereafter, they moved through the dark
hindgut at an average rate of 0.43 mm/min.
Hartman (1969) reports that P.prolifica ranges in length
from 1-6 cm. A typical animal has a hindgut of about 2 cm;
therefore, food would travel through it in about 1.5 hours.
Barnes (1964, 1965) noted that <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. socialis</span> and related
species create currents primarily with the beating membranelles
of the foliaceous parapodia. P. prolifica also depends prim¬
arily on this method. In addition, some animals occasionally
show slow posterior to anterior peristaltic waves which set up
currents. The movements of animals through tubes also serve
to circulate water.
P. prolifica does not show an ability to pump a unidi¬
rectional flow of water through a tube. Carmine particles were
observed flowing simultaneously into both ends of a section of
natural tube. Most characteristic was an ebb and flow pattern
at the mouth of the tube.
Six 15 cm long plastic tubes containing three individuals
each were covered at one end with phytoplankton netting. These
were placed in a 10 cells/ mi solution of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Dunaliella : Exact'>Dunaliella</span> tertig

The individual furthest from the open end typically did not
begin to catch the algae in its mucus bags until after 30 min¬
utes exposure. Most had caught algae after an hour. Three
of these tubes had three pin holes each, located along the
length of the tube. A t-test showed no significant difference
in rates of Dunaliella pick-up between the group with holes
and the group without (Table 1).
Water flows in the tubes at about 1 mm/sec until it pas¬
ses the foliaceous parapodia, slowing to 0.2 mm/sec past the
posterior region. The cilia covering much of the dorsal surface
set up eddies, resulting in turbulent water flow. The arrows
in Figure 7 show the directions of water flow around the body.
P. prolifica was able to tolerate oxygen stress. Ten
individuals were placed in each of five glass-stoppered reagent
bottles. Nitrogen was bubbled through three of these for 15
minutes, while air was bubbled through the other two. Oxygen
tension in the nitrogen bottles was determined with an oxygen
electrode to be less than 10% saturation. The bottles were
sealed and left in running sea water for 19 hours. After re¬
moval and examination, all animals were alive, and no differ¬
ences could be detected between the individuals in low oxygen
tension and the controls.
The movement of individuals in artificial tubes was
periodically observed during a five hour period. Three indivi¬
duals were placed in each of four 15 cm long plastic tubes,
one end of which was covered with phytoplankton netting. These
were vertically suspended in a running sea water aquarium.
Individuals were distinguished by the different number of fol¬

iaceous notopodia on each. Figure 8 summarizes the observations.
Each individual was closest to the tube opening relative
to the others in its tube for three or four of the ten observa¬
tion times. An analysis of variance showed no statistical
difference in the average times spent in each position. The
average interval between times spent in the closest position
was 1.8 hours, and the average distance travelled was 7.5 cm/hr.
* * *
The asexual form of P. prolifica is a highly modified
filter feeder which lives in a complex and densely populated
community. It therefore must have evolved a method for ensuring
that all tube-mates get adequate food and oxygen. Efficient
tube irrigation would seem necessary for success. However, the
long length, small diameter, branches, and closed ends of the
tubes might make irrigation difficult. Instead, P. prolifica
has evolved an energetically economical system which involves
a minimum of pumping and the need for little coordination
among tube-mates.
The slow speed at which water passes the animals' posterior
segments and the slow rate at which individuals further from
the tube opening pick up particles suggest that water moves
only slowly from the opening into the further reaches of the
tube. There the water may be stagnant and depleted of food
particles. However, animals continually change positions in
the tube; each animal therefore spends time at the tube mouth.
Food would travel through the gut of a typical animal in about
1.5 hours, and the average time spent away from the opening of
a tube is 1.8 hours. Thus the animal may move to the opening
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenwa
-10-

when it needs to empty its gut and move away when its gut
is full.
MacGinitie (1945) found that <span style='background-color:grey' title='Chaetopterus variopedatus : Fuzzy'>Chaetopterus yariopedatus</span>
can filter particles as small as proteins with its mucus net.
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. prolifica may</span> have the same ability, and it can filter out
54 <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Dunaliella : PartialExact'>Dunaliella cells</span> and also catch macroscopic particles with
its palps.
This ability to exploit a large range of particle
sizes, coupled with the ability to change the speed of mucus
ball formation with particle concentration, would allow the
animal to feed quickly. However, the sigmoid nature of the
curve in Figure 5 suggests that at high concentrations, P.
prolifica is limited by the rate at which it can produce and
consume mucus. At low concentrations the animals probably
have a maximum residence time for mucus balls.
The sections of tube near the opening are probably
deficient in oxygen, since a variety of tubiculous polychaetes
have been shown to remove 50-60% of the oxygen in the water
which passes their bodies (Dales, 1963). P. prolifica can
tolerate low oxygen tensions. The animals lie extended in tubes
with a maximum surface area exposed. The stirring action of
the cilia may serve to increase oxygen uptake by maximizing
exposure to the surrounding water. Furthermore, the pores in
natural tubes might aid in diffusion of water and food particles
into the upper reaches of the tubes, although such an effect
was not seen in the thicker-walled plastic tubes.
Thus all tube-mates are able to endure sub-optimal
conditions in between periods of heavy feeding.
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenwa
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
C. Function of Palps
P. prolifica uses its palps to remove fecal pellets
and other debris from the tubes. Fecal pellets are passed up
the dorsal, ciliated groove and carried by ciliary action to
the base of the palps. They are subsequently passed out to the
ends of the palps where they are prevented from moving further
by the knoblike processes located there. When the palps are
extended outside of the tubes, they pull apart from each other
and the particles are released.
Two types of particles are regularly carried up the
dorsal, ciliated groove: fecal pellets and food balls. However,
only fecal pellets are ejected by the palps. In order to
determine how this selectivity in rejection of particles is
accomplished, particles in the vicinity of the mouth were
observed for extended periods of time. Only particles less than
2504 in diameter were ever ingested. The diameter of fecal
pellets was found to be 250-350 and that of the mucus balls
was 150-2504. It was also observed that the arrival of particles
at the mouth was usually followed by a short retraction of
the body. During this retraction, fecal pellets were caught
in the outgoing groove of the palps, whereas the mucus balls
remained positioned at the mouth until swallowed.
An experiment was performed to study the effects of palp
removal on both the clearing and building of tubes. 25 individ¬
uals were confined to 10 mm sections of natural tubing. The
palps were removed from 10 of these individuals; the first
parapodia were removed from five others as controls. Tube¬
building was recorded daily, and other observations were made.
The individuals with palps and the controls had similar rates

Biology of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Phyll</span>
-12-
of tube-building. Those without palps had much slower rates
(Figure 9). The individuals without palps made only small
additions to the tubes and kept both ends closed with partitions.
These worms cleared their tubes by pushing feces out through
holes in the partitions with their peristomial collars. The
feces aggregated about the ends of the tubes. After about seven
days, the partitions were removed and the rate of tube-building
increased. The palps were 1-1.4 mm in length, long enough
to be extended out in front of the body.
A study was undertaken to determine the percentage of
time that individuals occupying the ends of tubes spend with
their palps protruding. Ten individuals in natural tubes were
placed in a glass bowl filled with sea water and watched
continuously for five hours. Similarly, fifteen individuals
were observed for two hours in their natural habitat at the
Monterey marina. Although the values obtained varied consid¬
erably from individual to individual, the palps were protruded
50% of the time (Table 3). During the seven hours of obser¬
vation, the palps were frequently seen carrying small particles
to the mouth; only five instances of ejection of debris from
the tubes were recorded.
In order to test the responsiveness of the palps to
mechanical stimulation, an artificial colony of individuals
in natural tubes was set up in a large glass bowl of sea water.
One end of each tube was held in place by clay, and the other
end was left free. In separate trials, l gm and .l gm weights
(only the difference in magnitudes is important) were dropped
from a height of 1 inch onto palps protruding from the ends of
Bioom, Bowers, Culienwar
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
-13
tubes. The retraction of the individuals into the tubes was
measured. The process was repeated 30 seconds after the palps
reappeared at the end of a tube, and time intervals between
stimulations were recorded. The process was repeated 20 times
with 10 individuals. Table 4 shows the average distance
retracted in response to the different weights. The difference
is significant to a level of .001. Thus the response is
graded; stimulation with the heavier weight causes a greater
withdrawal. No habituation to stimulation was found after
20 trials.
Autotomy of the palps was tested by clamping lead
shavings onto the palps of 20 individuals and recording the time
required for releasal. All 20 palps were released at the point
of attachment to the body, either by a jerk or by a long, steady
pull. The average time required for release was 4.5 minutes,
with a range from 15 seconds to 13 minutes.
The force required to release a palp was determined by
clamping successive lead shavings onto it, until it was released,
The force needed to break a palp was similarly found by
holding one end of a palp with forceps and adding shavings to
the other end until it broke. The force required for release
was 3.5 times greater than the force neede to break a palp
(2015 and 70:10 dynes, respectively).
Palps are frequently lost in natural populations; 54 out
of 300 individuals were found with regenerating palps. Regen-
erating palps are translucent and flared until they reach a
length of 1-1.4 mm. At this time the ends become knobbed,
and the palps themselves take on a brownish hue. Palp regen-
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
-14-
eration was studied by removing the palps from healthy
individuals. This was done both by pulling with forceps to
autotomize them and by cutting them with a scalpel to a length
of approximately .75 mm. Growth was measured daily. Similar
rates of regeneration were obtained for the two different
cases; the palps grew about .25 mm per day (Figures 10,11).
The growth was fairly linear, and the only difference between
the two cases was the initial 3-day period during which there
were no visible signs of growth for the palps which were pulled
free.
* * *
Observations on individuals occupying the ends of tubes
indicate that the palps are frequently protruded. The rarity
of fecal pellet ejection and the frequency of particle capture
suggest palps are protruded to feed. This feeding activity
is, of course, greatly reduced when an individual is not at
the end of a tube. Nevertheless, this phenomenon can serve
as a valuable, accessory feeding mechanism.
Besides serving to supplement filter-feeding, the palps
are important in clearing the tubes, especially in moving debris
away from the tube openings. Individuals who had their palps
removed tended to keep both ends of their tubes closed with
partitions. Feces aggregated about the ends of these tubes,
and the partitions were not removed until the palps were long
enough to successfully eject debris. This suggests that the
partitions were constructed to prevent the reentry of feces
into the tubes.
The frequency of regenerating palps in natural popula¬
tions leads one to believe that the loss of palps, possibly
Biology of
-
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
Phyllochaetopterus
-15-
by predation, may be a common phenomenon. The palp's sensitiv¬
ity to mechanical stimulation and the associated withdrawal
response are certainly of adaptive significance to this
animal. The gradation in this response permits the animal to
react appropriately to its environmental cues. Moderate
stimulation, as from particulate matter in the water, causes
a slight retraction, whereas the response to a strong stimulus,
such as would be inflicted by a predator, is a much greater
withdrawal.
The relatively weak attachment of the palp to the body
as compared to the strength of the palp itself could serve to
facilitate the release of an entrapped palp in order to avoid
predation. Shedding a palp seems to have no detrimental conse¬
quences for the individual; a new, functional palp can be
regnerated in ten days or less, and lost functions of the palps
can be compensated for in the meantime.
One final point concerning the palps has to do with the
ability of the animal to distinguish between fecal pellets and
food balls. It is possible that these two types of particles
are selectively separated by either of two independent methods.
One such method involves particle size; the fecal pellets are
too large to be ingested so they remain in the vicinity of the
mouth until they are eventually drawn away by the palps. A
second possibility is that the mucus in the food balls connects
them to the peristomial collar where they are held until
swallowed. Having no such mucus, the fecal pellets are caught
by the palps and carried away when the animal retracts.

D. Asexual reproduction and regeneration
In order to determine various aspects of regeneration,
P. prolifica were sectioned with a scapel in different areas
of the body: between the anterior and median sections, after
the first foliaceous parapodia, after the third foliaceous
parapodia, and between the median and posterior sections. Both
halves of the sectioned individuals were placed in plastic cap¬
illary tubes and kept in running seawater.
Further information on regeneration was obtained by observing
regenerating individuals ejected from natural tubes.
Results
A general growth and time sequence for anterior regeneration
in P. prolifica was determined (Figure 12). Frame A shows the
healed wound after sectioning an individual with a scalpel.
Healing of the wound is done by invagination, and occurs within
ten hours after sectioning.
Frames B and C show the extension phase of anterior re¬
generation. The new tissue formed is white, and no external
segmentation is visible.
It should be noted that palps and a mouth form before any
external segmentation can be seen (Frame D). Segmentation is an
all at once process, as parapodial lobes develop for all segments,
then setae appear (Frame E).
Frame F shows a fully functional miniaturized anterior re-
gion, which is still very white compared to the normal cream color
of the anterior region. After an individual has reached this
stage, the new anterior region enlarges and regains its normal
color over a 2 to 3 week period.
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
Varying abilities for anterior regeneration were observed
as a function of the location of the artificial sectioning. Those
individuals sectioned between the anterior and median region,
after the first foliaceous parapodia, and after the third folia-
ceous parapodia regenerated at approximately equal rates. In
contrast, those individuals sectioned between the median and the
posterior sections were observed to take comparatively longer
times for similar development.
Feeding was observed as early as stage A, but it was not
as efficient a process as observed for normal individuals. At
stage F feeding was observed to be essentially normal. Feeding
was not observed for regenerating individuals lacking foliaceous
parapodia.
Posterior regeneration
A general time and growth sequence for posterior regeneration
was also determined (Figure 13). Frame A shows the healed
wound after sectioning. In this case, healing is accomplished
by evagination of the gut lining.
As can be seen in frame C, neuropodia develop before noto¬
podia in the extended region. However, unlike anterior regenera¬
tion, segmentation occurs in a sequential pattern through time.
The oldest segments are the most anterior and decrease in age
posteriorly.
Ppsterior regeneration occurs over an indefinite amount of
time. After the initial growth of the tail, the process slows,
and segments are then added a few at a time, with no observible
pattern. This is evidenced by the finding of individuals in
tubes with 20 or more normal sized posterior segments and a very
small extension with one or two developing neuropodia.
Bloom, Bowers.

Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
As in anterior regeneration, varying abilities for posterior
regeneration were observed. Individuals sectioned between
the median and posterior regions, after the third foliaceous para-
podia, and after the first foliaceous parapodia regenerated
at approximately equal rates. Those individuals sectioned between
the median and anterior regions were observed to take compara¬
tively longer time for similar development.
Foliaceous parapodia regeneration
Foliaceous parapodia have been observed to regenerate be¬
tween the anterior and median sections of individuals. Regen-
eration between median and posterior segments has never been
observed, but the possibility should not be excluded. Time in¬
volved in this process seems to be rather long, and no inherent
pattern or criteria for regeneration has been determined.
Regeneration in natural tubes
Up to 30% of the individuals inhabiting natural tubes have
been found undergoing some stage of regeneration. 82% (49 of 60)
of the recently budded individuals (frame B in figs. 12813) have
foliaceous parapodia directly either anterior or posterior to the
budded area; the other 18% are budded directly anterior to a
variable number of setigerous segments in the anterior region of
the individual. In this case, as with regeneration of whole an-
terior sections, the number of setigerous segments in the fully
regenerated individual is pre-determined, and enough segments
are added to complete the normal anterior region. No indivi¬
duals have been found to be regenerating from anterior or post-
erior segments alone.
Behavior
Biology of
Bloom, Bowers,
-19-
Phyllochaetopterus
Regenerating individuals exhibited notable behavior. The
anterior halves of those individuals sectioned in the median
region set up partitions and built extensions on their tubes,
a normal behavior for naturally occurring individuals. These
individuals were also observed to have their palps protruding
from the end of their tubes. Anterior halves of individuals
sectioned between the anterior and median regions exhibited no
such behavior, and were often found to have fallen out of their
tubes onto the bottom of the finger bowl in which they were
stored. This phenomenon was also observed in the case of post-
erior halves sectioned between the median and posterior regions,
* * *
Unlike Chaetopterus variopedatus, where the ability to
regenerate is body region specific (Berrill, 1928), Phyllo¬
chaetopterus prolifica has the ability to regenerate anteriorly
or posteriorly from any section in the body. It is not known
if regeneration can occur both anteriorly and posteriorly from
one segment; however, cases have been observed where regeneration
is proceeding in both directions. As found for <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. variopedatus,</span>
no dedifferentiation of existing segments seems to occur during
regeneration.
The total number of segments in the anterior region of an
individual is constant. This number is achieved in regeneration
whether complete or partial regeneration is occurring.
Complete anterior regeneration is a faster process than
posterior regeneration. There seems to be a need for a fully
functional anterior section to regenerate fairly quickly. This
assumption is supported by the development of sensory and feeding
organs (palps, eye spots, and a mouth) before the development of
Cullenwar
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
Biology of Phyllochaetopterus

segmentation. Also, a fully functional anterior region is formed
in miniature, and then the enlargement occurs.
This method of
regeneration is completely different from the sequential poster¬
ior method of regeneration, which, as shown, occurs over an in¬
definite amount of time.
In support of asexual reproduction by autotomy in the median
regiom, the following points should be noted:
1) Anterior and posterior regeneration from median regions
is faster than the same processes from posterior or anterior seg¬
ments alone.
2) 82% of the recently budded individuals found in natural
tubes have done so in the median region. The other 18% can be
explained by the loss of anterior segments due to predation. It
is unlikely for autotomy to occur in the anterior region, as
behavior patterns have been shown to be particularly maladaptive
in the case of lone anterior segments.
3) No anterior or posterior regions alone have been observed
undergoing regeneration in natural tubes.
4) Barnes (1965) observed that the foliaceous parapodia
are the major food gathering segments, and provide water currents
through the tubes. It has been observed that regeneration of the
foliaceous parapodia is a slow process. Thus, if autotomy were
to occur outside of the median body region, one half of the split
individual would have to go without these essential segments for
an extended period of time. This process would be maladaptive
for the survival of the half without foliaceous parapodia, and
therefore the advantage of asexual reproduction by autotomy
would be lost.
The preceeding four points clearly support and document the

fact that asexual reproduction by autotomy and regeneration is
taking place in the median body region of P. prolifica.
E. Aspects of sexual forms
Investigation of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Phyllochaetopterus : PartialExact'>Phyllochaetopterus colonies</span> revealed the
presence of two different tube sizes. The smaller tubes ranged
in diameter from 0.5-1.0 mm, while the larger tubes ranged from
1.2-1.8 mm. Whereas the smaller tubes contained the expected
multiple asexual forms, the large tubes were, singly inhabited
by a much larger fonm of P. prolifica. Table 5 compares average
number of segments per body region in the two forms. The differ¬
ences in all means are significant at the.OOl level.
The posterior segments of the large forms are either orange
or cream colored, associated with the presence of female and male
gametes respectively. The orange color in the female is due pri¬
marily to pigmented spheres; the eggs themselves are brown, often
not quite spherical, and range in size from 65-70 1. Coloration
in the male is due to the sperm, which are slightly oval with a
diameter of 3 /. Attempts to fertilize eggs were made in the
latter part of May, but were unsuccessful.
Twenty colonies of P. prolifica were examined, all containing
at least four sexual forms in individual large tubes. Each large
tube was enmeshed with small tubes, forming a dense, flat mat
which was attached to a styrofoam float or a cement pillar.
Integration of a large tube into the mat occurred either at one
end with the other end of the tube hanging freely, or in the
middle of the tube with both ends hanging freely.
Tubes containing sexual individuals are very rarely branched
(3 tubes out of 123 investigated), and if so, only in the last
few centimeters of the free-hanging end. No connections between

large tubes or between large and small tubes were observed.
Large tubes are of a uniform diameter throughout their
individual length, and have an average length of 16.2 cm (n=43,
range= 8-23 cm).
Upon investigation of a 10 ft“ area under the floats at the
Monterey marina, sexual forms were found, each occupying their
own tube, in the absence of asexual colonies. Of the 69 in¬
dividuals found in this area, 33 were male, 34 were female, and
two contained no gametes. Although containing no gametes, the
latter two closely resembled the sexual forms in size and appear-
ance.
Individuals that contain orange pigment and eggs have been
found living in association with, and in the tubes of asexual
forms of P. prolifica. However, these individuals resemble the
asexual forms in size and appearance, and the relative amount of
pigment and gametes present is greatly reduced.
Differences were found in the average size of asexual in¬
dividuals found in different colonies. In one colony, tube
diameter was approximately 0.5 mm and the average length of asex¬
ual individuals was 7 mm (n=20, range- 5-9 mm). In another colony,
tube diameter was approximately 1.0 mm, and the average length
of an asexual individual was 14 mm (n=65, range- 10-25 mm). No
differences were noted between the sexual individuals of these
two colonies.

Berkeley and Berkeley (1952) first reported the presence of
sexual forms of P. prolifica. However, they were only described

as having up to 40 or more posterior segments, and no description
of different sexes was given. The striking difference of the ex-
ternal morphology between sexual and asexual forms shown previous¬
ly, coupled with the finding of egg-bearing individuals in asexual
tubes, leads us to believe that the sexual forms described by
Berkeley and Berkeley are the egg-bearing individuals in asexual
tubes.
The fact that sexual individuals are always found associated
with sexual individuals, and the discovery of sexual forms in
isolation suggests that the asexual colonies arise from larvae
which settle on sexual individuals. This assumption is supported
by the finding of uniform asexual tube diameters in a colony, while
variations occur between colonies. This variation is most probably
not due to environmental factors, as colonies of varying tube di¬
ameters were found in close proximity of one another. One possi¬
ble explanation for this variation may be genetic similarity within
a colony, and genetic dissimilarity between colonies. The possi¬
bility exists that an asexual colony can arise from a single asex¬
ual individual.
A possible model for asexual versus sexual development is
differential development of settled larvae. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Larvae : Exact'>Larvae</span> that settle
solitarily develop directly into sexual individuals, while those
that settle in close proximity of mature, sexual individuals
are inhibited from maturing and develop asexually. This is
supported by the finding of single immature individuals in large
tubes, and the constant association of sexual individuals with
asexual individuals. Since sexual individuals are found near
one another, this differential settling may be very specific for
the presence of already mature sexual individuals before asexual
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward

-24-
development occurs. Larvae may be searching for mature sexual
tubes to settle on, and, if unsuccessful, they settle solitarily
and develop into sexual forms themselves.
It is doubtful that the individuals found with gametes in
asexual tubes ever develop into fully mature, sexual individuals.
For maximum genetic input, these 'maturing' asexual individuals
would have to grow to a size paralleling that of the mature sex¬
ual individuals. This also seems unlikely as the average asex-
ual individual would have to increase its length at least tenfold,
This increase in size would require a large tube to accomadate
the individual. However, the total lack of connections between
asexual and sexual tubes and the uniform diameter of large tubes
indicate that no enlargement is taking place. It is also highly
improbable that an individual would leave its tube to start
building a new one, due to the presence of predators associated
with the colony, and an individuals inability to maneuver effi¬
ciently outside of a tube.
A possible explanation for the presence of egg-bearing
individuals in asexual tubes may be the decrease in effect of
the sexual maturation inhibitory process, permitting limited
gamete production. This decrease in effectiveness may be due
to the colony size or certain environmental factors. It is sus¬
pected that the gametes produced are eventually reabsorbed by the
asexual individual.

UMMARY
1. P. prolifica communally inhabits tubes in densities of
one animal per 4 centimeters of tube.
2. Rate of mucous ball formation is a function of particle
concentration.
3. P. prolifica does not create a unidirectional water flow
through the tubes; instead, each animal periodically comes to the
mouth of the tube to feed.
4. Rate of particle movement through the gut corresponds
to the amount of time spent away from the tube mouth.
5. The palps are used in feeding, voiding feces, and as
sensory appendages.
6. Palps are extended from the tube opening for approximately
50% of the time, in both field and lab observations.
7. Palps are capable of autotomy, and 18% of the population
is found to be in the process of regeneration.
8. P. prolifica has the ability to regenerate anteriorly or
posteriorly from any body region.
9. Anterior regeneration occurs faster than posterior regen¬
eration and is achieved by a different process. Anteriorly, seg¬
mentation and further development of the segments takes place
over the whole new body region uniformly, as cpposed to the more
sequential segment-by-segment process of posterior regeneration.
10. Asexual reproduction by autotomy and regeneration occurs
in the median body region.
11. Sexual forms of P. prolifica are larger and inhabit
bigger tubes than the asexual forms.
Bloom, Bowers, Cullenward
Biology of Phylloch

12. All asexual colonies contain sexual forms inhabiting
large individual tubes. Sexual forms are also found in the ab¬
sence of asexual colonies.
13. Differential larval development is suggested as a pos¬
sible mechanism for asexual versus sexual development.
