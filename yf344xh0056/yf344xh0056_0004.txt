Methods and Materials
Calanus helgolandicus individuals were selected from
zooplankton tows taken in Monterey Bay, California.
A one-meter diameter net (0.33 mm mesh aperture) was
towed for 5-15 minutes at various depths. In April and
early May, 1969, surface tows brought up large numbers
of adult female C. helgolandicus, but later in May, only
younger stages could be found and only at 20-60 meters.
This species was much less abundant through the summer,
and at times it was not possible to get enough individuals
because of large numbers of salps. However, one tow in
early August was nearly all Calanus helgolandicus.
Stage V copepodites were used in some experiments.
The copepods were kept in open jars at 9-14Â°C under
reduced illumination. Once or twice a week stocks were
transferred by pipette to fresh sea water which had been
filtered through cotton or Whatman 1 filter paper and
were fed small quantities of phytoplankton. The appear-
ance of fecal pellets was evidence that the animals were
feeding. Adult females survived very well under these
conditions. After the first few days in the artificial
environment, nearly all lived for many weeks. Stage V's
survived less well, possible because of the high mortality
during molting (Mullin and Brooks, 1967).
