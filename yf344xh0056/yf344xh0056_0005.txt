Incubations to determine the uptake of C-DDT from
sea water were carried out in screw-capped gallon jars
or sealed quart Mason jars to prevent loss of the pesticide
by codistillation. The jars were kept in water baths
at 9-14°0 under reduced illumination. The gallon jars,
which were used for short term experiments, contained
40 copepods at a density of 50 ml/animal in previously-
aerated, membrane-filtered sea water. The quart Mason
jars, used for ten-day experiments, each contained 10
copepods in 500 ml of sea water. In both situations,
C-DDT was added to the water in test jars before the
animals. C-DDT was either used directly from a stock
solution (100 ug of ring-labeled C-DDT from Amersham/
Searle Corporation per ml of absolute ethanol) or diluted
first in ethanol or sea water so that very low concentra¬
tions would be made conveniently. In a control run with
0.258 ethanol (the highest ethanol concentration used
in experiments), the behavior and survival of the copepods
did not appear altered by the alcohol. At various inter-
vals in the uptake experiments, copepods were removed
from the gallon jars in groups of about ten along with
enough water to maintain the original density of 50 ml/
animal. When quart jars were used, the contents of one
whole jar were removed and the remaining animals were
transferred to fresh C'"-DDT-containing sea water to
