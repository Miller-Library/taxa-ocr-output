Discussion
The solubilities of DDT in oil and water are about
10% (Södergren,1968) and 1.2 parts per billion (Bowman,
Acree, and Corbett, 1960). In view of this high partition
coefficient, it is not surprising that the copepod Calanus
helgolandicus rapidly concentrates DDT from the surrounding
sea water into its lipid-containing tissues, and the copepod
may be compared to a small drop of lipid with a high
surface-to-volume ratio.
The experiments done in sea water C-DDT concentra¬
tions of 0.1 and 1 ppb are not ecologically significant
because, although DDT is soluble in water up to 1.2 ppb,
natural concentrations are much lower even in areas with
high local contamination. But it is significant that
uptake was detected at 5, 25, and 50 ppt, or nearer
supposed natural ambient levels. The ten-day experiments
suggest that a steady rate of uptake of DDT from low
concentrations in the water into higher concentrations
in the animals is established after a few days of rapid
uptake and that this rate is higher when DDT in the water
is more concentrated. Since the C-DDT taken up in these
experiments was in addition to that cold DDT already
taken up in the environment and since the natural levels
of DDT in C. helgolandicus populations and in Monterey
