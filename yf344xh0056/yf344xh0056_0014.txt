DDT also concentrates in phytoplankton, and
Calanus helgolandicus, by feeding, can take up this DDT
more readily than that which is dissolved in sea water.
This is direct evidence of transfer of DDT from a primary
producer to a herbivore in the marine food web. Although
the phytoplankton were exposed to non-ecological levels
of C-DDT to load them for feeding to the copepods,
transfer has nevertheless been demonstrated. These findings
suggest that, in their natural environment, copepods may
accumulated DDT from their food, as well as, to a lesser
extent, straight from the water. It would appear that
copepods would continue to get more and more DDT as they
eat more DDT-containing diatoms.
The DDT which is accumulated and stored in Calanus
helgolandicus is further concentrated and stored in higher
trophic levels because these copepods are part of the diet
of some kinds of fish and other zooplankton predators.
Uptake of DDT directly from water by planktonic organisms
may help to maintain very low levels in the surrounding
water while functioning as an entry point for DDT into
the marine food web at its broad base.
