Abstract
The herbivorous marine planktonic copepod Calanus
helgolandicus was incubated in sea water which contained
C+4-DDT or phytoplankton labeled with C+4-DDT to study
the entrance of DDT into the marine food web at a low
trophic level. The copepods concentrated C++-DDT by a factor
of about 10,000 in 24 hours and continued to take up C+4-DDT
from low levels in the water in ten-day experiments.
C+-DDT was also found in copepods which had been fed
C+-DDT-containing phytoplankton.
