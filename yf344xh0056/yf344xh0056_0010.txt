Results
Figures 1 and 2 show uptake of C-DDT by adult
female Calanus helgolandicus over a 32-hour period from
0.1 and 1 part per billion (ug/1) in the water. In both
cases, the DDT was about 10,000 times more concentrated
in the animals, in terms of dry weight, in 24 hours.
The copepods removed 3-4% of the C-DDT which had been
added to the culture. A similar curve was obtained for
stage V copepodites incubated in 25 part per trillion
for four and a half days (Figure 3). Over the longer
time period, the animals accumulated DDT from water of
low concentration to intra-animal concentrations nearly
as high as from water with four times more DDT.
Figure 4 shows the data for uptake of C-DDT by
adult female C. helgolandicus over a ten-day period from
50 ppt in the water in three separate experiments.
The curves are not identical, probably because of variaÂ¬
tions in the exact amounts of C-DDT present and in
the animal dry weights (see discussion above in Methods
and Materials), but each shows that the rate of uptake of
C-DDT decreases after the initial rapid rate and suggests
that concentrations in the animals may be stabilizing.
Experiments with lower sea water DDT concentrations
(Figure 5) also show this decrease in rate, and, in fact,
