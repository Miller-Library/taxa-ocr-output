biases: 120-200 ug for adult females and 90-120 ug
for stage V copepodites. This means that experiments
done with animals from a single tow are comparable
because of a common factor, while data from experiments
using animals from different tows can be related only
qualitatively since the amount of radioactive DDT taken
up by the copepods is expressed as uug C-DDT per ug
average dry weight (or parts per million).
Diatom cultures were grown in 250-500 ml Ehrlen¬
meyer flasks containing 50-200 ml of an enriched sea
water medium (500 mole/1 KNO,, 50 mole/1 K,HPO), 500 mole/1
Na,SiO, plus trace amounts of Fecl,, MnSo, Znso,,
Na,Moo, Cocl,, CuSO, EDTA, thiamine, B,», and biotin).
The flasks were kept under constant illumination at 14°0
and were shaken occasionally. Fresh cultures were started
by one-milliliter inoculations into fresh medium. The
populations were mixed, but in April and May were rich
with Skeletonema costatum, along with Thalassiosira sp.,
Chaetoceros spp., Nitzschia sp., and Asterionella sp.
The cultures flourished much less consistently in the
summer months with many not growing at all. The most
successful diatom in June, July, and August was Asterionella.
Skeletonema did not appear in summer phytoplankton tows,
and the old Skeletonema cultures could not be recultured.
Rhizosolenia was common in tows but did not grow in
