Introduction
The damage which DDT is causing to birds at the
upper end of the marine food web is well documented
(Wurster and Wingate, 1968). Although the levels of DDT
which contaminate the world's oceans are low (of the
order of parts per trillion), the pesticide is concen-
trated in the food web and stored in lipid deposits so
that it may be over a million times more concentrated
in high level carnivores such as the Bermuda petrel and
peregrine falcon. There has been no direct evidence
of this concentration phenomenon at lower trophic levels.
I examined the entrance of DDT into the marine food web
by measuring the uptake of radioactively labeled DDT
by the planktonic copepod Calanus helgolandicus. Groups
of these animals were incubated in sea water containing
1-DDT or were fed C1-DDT-labeled phytoplankton.
