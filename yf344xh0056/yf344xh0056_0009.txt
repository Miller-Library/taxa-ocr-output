diluted C-DDT not taken up by the cells to less than
0.01%. However, this procedure involving centrifugation
was not successful with Chaetoceros cells and those in
all the later cultures since these cells did not spin
down. This unfortunate circumstance meant that only a
few feeding experiments were successfully carried out.
Radioactivity in the phytoplankton resuspensions was
measured by counting 2.0 ml samples dissolved in 10 ml
of Bray's solution (100 ml ethanol, 20 ml ethylene glycol,
4 g PPO, 0.2 g POPOP, and 60 g naphthalene to one liter
in dioxane) in the liquid scintillation counter.
Feeding experiments were carried out under the same
conditions as uptake experiments with 30 animals per
gallon jar in indirect light to maintain the phytoplankton.
C'-DDT-labeled phytoplankton was added at a concentration
of about 10" cells per ml of copepod culture. When the
copepods were removed and filtered, they were gently
washed off the first filter and refiltered to reduce
contamination from labeled phytoplankton cells.
