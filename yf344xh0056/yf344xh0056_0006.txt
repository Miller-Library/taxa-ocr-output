approximate conditions of constant flow. The copepods
were filtered onto Whatman l filter paper, washed with
distilled water, and place in liquid scintillation vials
to which a solution of the dyes PPO (4 g/1) and POPOP
(0.1 g/1) in toluene was then added. The vials were
counted on a Nuclear-Chicago Unilux II Liquid Scintilla-
tion Counter (95% confidence limits: 2n, where n
is the number of counts). It was discovered that even
if each copepod exoskeleton was punctured, the radio-
activity did not dissolve completely in the toluene
solution for 2-4 days. Hence, all the final data is
based on counts made four days after the completion of
each experiment. The specific activity of the C-DDT
was 19 mC/mM, so that one disintegration per minute
(dpm) represented 8.38 pug of C-DDT.
Since drying C"-DDT-containing copepods may drive
off radioactive DDT and contaminate equipment, average
dry weight determinations were made on large numbers of
stock animals instead of drying test organisms. Animals
were dried at 50Â°C for 12 hours in 10 or more groups of
10 or 20 in aluminum cups. This was done for animals from
each new tow. Computations using the student's t test
showed there was little variability among groups from
a single tow, but the range was great between the means
for different tows, probably because of varying selector
