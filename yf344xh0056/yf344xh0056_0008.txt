cultures. The earlier Skeletonema cultures were followed
closely by counting them in a Sedgwick-Rafter counting
chamber. Doubling time was about 12 hours until the cell
density reached 1 to 2 x 102 cells/ml. No successful
means was found for counting the later cultures since the
bouyant cells (mostly Asterionella and Chaetoceros) did
not sink to the bottom of the counting chamber. An attempt
to follow cell density by measuring optical density with
the Klett spectrophotometer was also unsuccessful since the
difference between no cells at all and maximum density
was only about 10 Klett units. Those summer cultures
which grew reached their peak in a week or longer.
Only cultures which were still in logarithmic phase
were used for feeding experiments. The cells were incu¬
bated in 10 ug/ml C-DDT for 15 minutes. Previous work
(Södergren, 1968) indicates that the unicellular alga
Chlorella removes 52-77 of a low concentration of C-DDT
(0.6 ug/ml) from the medium in 15 seconds. The cultures
were centrifuged briefly, washed twice in membrane-filtered
sea water, and resuspended to the original volume. Non-
radioactive cells which had undergone this treatment
recovered and grew in fresh medium. Nearly all of the
cells in predominantly Skeletonema cultures came down
in the pellet so the final resuspension had the same
density as the original culture. The washing procedure
