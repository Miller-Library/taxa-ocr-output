these curves suggest after an initial period (two days),
the copepods takeup
-DDT at a constant rate which
is proportional to the amount of C-DDT present.
In all of these experiments, the amount of C-DDT was
not limiting as less than 10% of that in the water over
any period of time was removed by the animals.
Figure 6 shows that the copepods did take up
radioactive DDT from ingested phytoplankton in three
tests with stage V copepodites. That the animals were
accumulating C"-DDT as they ate the diatoms is clear,
although it is not known why in one test, the second group
of copepods removed had less C-DDT than the first.
Of the stage V's in two of these test, more died in the
test jars than in the control: 11 of 32 and 10 of 34
compared to 6 of 31 in the control. In a separate
preliminary experiment with stage V's, molting individuals
suffered a higher mortality rate in water with 1 ppb
DDT than in 10 ppt DDT or in the control. But in the
feeding experiment, two dead copepods from each of the
test jars were filtered, washed, and counted and were
found to contain less C-DDT than those which remained
alive, so that whether DDT was associated with these
deaths is unclear. In these two test situations, approxi-
mately 243 of the starting radioactivity was accounted for
in the live and dead copepods. The C-DDT concentrations
