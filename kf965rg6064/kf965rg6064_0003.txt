neurons directly activates two types of cGMP-gated channels and at least one
type of IP3-gated channel. This study is the first to examine the properties of
cyclic nucleotide- and IP3-gated ion channels in Pagurus samuelis olfactory
receptor neurons
Materials and Methods
Olfactory sensilla (aesthetascs) were cut from the antennule of the hermit
crab, Pagurus samuelis following the methods of Hatt and Ache (1994). The
antennule was cut from the hermit crab in a saline solution (460 mM NaCl, 60
mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 1.7 mM glucose, and pH 7.8) that had
been kept on ice, and bubbled with O2. The sensilla contain the dendritic
branches of the olfactory receptor neurons and they were cut off as close to the
antennule as possible (Fig. 1). The sensilla were cut from the antennule in the
same ice-cold saline solution but in a dish coated with poly(D-lysine). For the
patches to which cGMP was applied, the solution was diluted 80:20 with distilled
H2O. However a 100% saline solution was used for the patches to which IP3 was
applied. In both cases the outer dendrites immediately extruded from the cut
tips and began to form vesicles (Fig. 2). These vesicles could be patch-clamped
without requiring enzymatic treatment (Hatt and Ache, 1994). The recording
chamber was cooled to 12-15Â°
Single channel recordings were made using an Axopatch 200A amplifier.
Data analysis was done using PCLAMP (Axon Instr.) and DEmsTER software.
Filtering of records was done with an 8-pole bessel filter. Pipettes were made
from borosilicate capillary tubing (Sutter Instruments) and coated with Silgard
elastomer (Dow Corning). Symmetrical solutions were used in the electrodes
and in the bath containing the sensilla. Membrane patches were excised to
