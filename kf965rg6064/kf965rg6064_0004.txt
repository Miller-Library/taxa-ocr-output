obtain an inside-out configuration and then brought through the air-water
interface to gain access to the inner membrane face. Either 1 mM CGMP or 2 uM
IP3 was applied to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. 10 mM Catt was
applied to one of the patches. Agonists were suspended in a saline solution (460
mM NaCl, 60 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 1.7 mM glucose, and pH
7.8).
Results
The application of cGMP or IP3 to the inner face of the membrane resulted
in channel activity in all of the patches tested, suggesting that there is a high
density of cGMP- and IP3-gated ion channels in the inner dendritic membrane of
the hermit crab. The patches that were analyzed did not show any channel
activity in the absence of agonist, indicating that no voltage dependent or
spontaneously active channels were present. Four patches were analyzed in
detail.
Two types of cGMP gated channels
Cyclic GMP activated channels of two different conductances 22 and 86
pS. The two channel types were studied in isolation in separate patches (Fig. 3).
Conductance was determined in two ways: by analyzing individual single
channel openings from numerous digitized records and averaging the results,
and by studying the slope of the linear least squares regression fit to the data in a
voltage plot. The results obtained from these two methods were then compared.
Figure 3 shows the current-voltage relationship for the two channel types. In
each case, the slope of the line is the approximate conductance of the channel.
