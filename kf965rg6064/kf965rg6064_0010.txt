Conclusions
This study demonstrates the existence of cGMP- and IP3-gated ion
channels in Pagurus samuelis olfactory receptor neurons. Two types of cGMPÂ¬
gated channels of conductances 22 pS and 86 pS were observed in inside out
patches in symmetrical Naf solutions. Channel activity was blocked by the
addition of 10 mM Ca+t to the inside face of the patch. One IP3-gated channel of
conductance 13 pS was also observed. There was suggestion of two more IP3-
gated channels with larger conductances. Channel activity of cGMP- and IP3-
gated channels was not blocked by 60 mM Mg+ levels on both sides of the
patch. These results demonstrate that the dual signaling pathway found in the
Caribbean lobster may also apply to other crustaceans like the hermit crab, and
possibly other invertebrates.
