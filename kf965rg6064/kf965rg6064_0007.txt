Multiple IP3 gated channels with larger conductances
A patch was obtained that contained multiple IP3-gated ion channels.
Clustering of individual channel conductances in a conductance vs. conductance
plot suggests the possibility of three different IP3-gated channel types with
conductances of 24 pS, 83 pS, and 180 pS (Fig. 13). The 24 pS channel observed
here may be the same channel as the 13 pS channel obtained from the single IP3-
gated channel patch. The larger conductance channels also exhibited high flicker
and demonstrated characteristic burst-like activity (Fig. 14 A). The mean unitary
current was determined from a current amplitude distribution histogram, and
was 4 pA (Fig. 14 B). The conductance of the channel in this particular recording
is 82 pS as determined by Ohm's law.
Cyclic GMP and IP3 channels function in 60 mM Mgt
All patches and channels recordings were made in symmetrical 60 mM
Mg++. Similar Mg++ levels are known to block all channel activity in vertebrate
olfaction. However hermit crab channel activity was not blocked.
Discussion
Then finding that cyclic nucleotide- and IP3-gated ion channels are
expressed in hermit crab olfactory receptor neurons is consistent with the results
obtained from the Caribbean lobster. No channel activity was noted in the
absence of secondary messengers. These results support the model for dual
signal transduction pathways mediated by cAMP and IP3 that was proposed for
lobster.
It is unclear which cyclic nucleotide, cAMP or cGMP is the mediator in the
olfactory signal transduction cascade, or if both cAMP and cGMP are involved.
