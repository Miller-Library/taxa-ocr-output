of the lines collected from two different patches indicates that two channels with
different conductances are expressed in the olfactory dendrites.

A. Single channel recording from a patch with 1 mM cGMP applied to the inside
face. The dotted line represents the zero current level. There is an indication of
partial closures, suggesting a possible substate for this channel. Filtered with an
8-pole bessel filter at 1 kHz and digitized at 500 us/pt.
B. Current-amplitude distribution histogram from the channel in Part A. The
distribution was fit with two gaussian curves with mean amplitudes of 0.01 pA
and -0.84 pA. The mean open probability was approximately 0.66.

Single channel current-voltage relationship in symmetrical Na+ solutions.
Channel activated by applying 1 mM cGMP to the inner face of the patch. A
linear least squares regression was fit to the data. The slope of the line indicates
the conductance of the channel, approximately 22 pS.
Figure 6.
Channel open probability for the 22 pS channel, activated by 1 mM cGMP. Open
probability is defined as mean open time divided by mean closed time using a
50% criterion to define gating transitions. This graph indicates that there is no
voltage dependence of open probability.
