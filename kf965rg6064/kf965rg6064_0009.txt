This channel also exhibited a voltage dependence of channel open probability
which increased in the depolarizing direction.
Recordings obtained from a patch with multiple IP3-gated channels
indicate the possibility of more channels with larger conductances of 83 and 180
pS. In lobster, two different IP3-gated channels are observed with conductances
of 27 and 64 pS and both exhibit a voltage dependence of channel open
probability (Hatt and Ache, 1994). Evidence for a much larger channel, possibly
activated by IP4 was also found in lobster (Hatt and Ache, 1994). However, the
rapid inter conversion of IP3 and IP4 make such a study difficult in the present
experiment since IP4 can be a contaminant of commercially available IP3.
All recordings of channel activity were made in 60 mM Mg-
concentration that has been shown to block all channel activity in vertebrate
cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (Zufall et al., 1994). A great deal of channel
activity was recorded from the hermit crab at these high Mg++ levels suggesting
that the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels of vertebrates and invertebrates may
have significantly different channel structures.
In the hermit crab, the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel was blocked by 10
mM Ca“t added to the inside face of the patch. Vertebrate cyclic nucleotide¬
gated channels are thought to produce an inward current of Nat and Ca+t upon
activation. This indicates a further difference in cyclic nucleotide-gated channel
properties between vertebrates and invertebrates.
The results of these experiments indicating the presence of both cyclic
nucleotide- and IP3-gated ion channels in hermit crab olfactory receptor neurons
supports the proposed model for dual signal transduction. The data suggest that
both cyclic nucleotides and IP3 may act as secondary messengers in olfaction.
