The significant difference in slopes demonstrates that the two channel types have
very different conductances.
CGMP activated a 22 pS channel
The smaller conductance channel exhibited a great deal of flicker in the
open state with prolonged bursts of rapid openings and closings (Fig. 4 A). The
mean unitary current was calculated by fitting two gaussian functions to a
current amplitude distribution histogram and was determined to be -0.84 pA at a
voltage of -40 mV pipette negative (Fig. 4 B). The relative areas under the curve
represent the time spent in the open and closed states, and this plot shows that
the channel was open 66% of the time. The smaller conductance channel had an
average slope conductance of 22 pS (Fig. 5). Conductance was determined both
by analyzing individual discrete channel openings from the digitized record, and
by the slope of the linear least squares regression curve fit to the current-voltage
plot shown in Figure 5. This channel showed no voltage dependence of open
probability although the data was varied (Fig. 6). Open probability was
determined by the mean open time divided by the mean closed time for the
channel using a 50% criterion for detection of channel opening.
CGMP activated an 86 pS channel
Cyclic GMP activated a second channel type with a conductance of
approximately 86 pS. Conductance was measured by analyzing individual
single channel openings and by the slope of the linear regression fit of the
current-voltage relationship (Fig. 7). The mean unitary current was determined
from a gaussian curve fit to a current-amplitude distribution histogram. The
open probability of the larger conductance channel appeared to be voltage
dependent (Fig. 8). Channel open probability determined by mean open time
