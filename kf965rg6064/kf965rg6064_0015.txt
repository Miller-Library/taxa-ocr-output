Figure 14.
Single channel recording from a patch with 2 uM IP3 applied to the inside face
and a pipette voltage of +30 mV. The dotted line represents the zero current
level. Filtered with an 8-pole bessel filter set at 2 kHz and digitized at 250 us/pt.
The long closed state of the channel followed by significant channel activity
demonstrates the burst-like nature of opening events. By Ohmâ€™s law the
conductance of the channel is about 82 pS. This recording is an example of the
larger conductance channels observed in the multichannel patch.
