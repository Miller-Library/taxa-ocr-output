Abstract
Cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and 1,4,5-inositol
trisphosphate (IP3) both act as secondary messengers in odor transduction,
activating ion channels in Pagurus samuelis olfactory receptor neurons. Two
different cGMP-gated ion channels were observed in inside-out patches in
symmetrical Na“ solutions: one with a conductance of 22 pS, and the other with
à more varied conductance of approximately 86 pS. Unlike cGMP-gated
channels in vertebrate olfactory receptors which are blocked by divalent cations.
these cGMP channels were not blocked by 60 mM Mg++. They were however
completely blocked by the addition of Ca+t to the inner face of the patch. An
1P3-gated ion channel with a conductance of 13 pS was observed that was also
not blocked by Mg““. There was also suggestion of two additional IP3 channels
with larger conductances. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of
cGMP- and IP3-gated ion channels in Pagurus olfactory receptor neurons. This
dual signal transduction pathway, mediated by cGMP and IP3, may allow for the
integration of a broader range of information representing a blend of odors.
Introduction
Odorants are thought to activate olfactory receptor neurons by binding to
G-protein coupled receptors that modulate the production of at least two kinds
of intracellular second messengers, cyclic nucleotides (cyclic 3’,5'-adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic 3’,5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)), and
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). These second messengers then activate
multiple channels resulting in either activation or inactivation of the receptor
neuron (Boekhoff et al. 1994). Cyclic nucleotide and IP3 olfactory transduction
