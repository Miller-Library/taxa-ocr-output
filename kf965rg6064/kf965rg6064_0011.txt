Figure 1.
A close up view of a hermit crab antennule with a few sensilla still attached.
Each antennule has approximately 100 such hair-like olfactory sensilla.
Figure 2.
View of the cut end of the distal tip of one the olfactory sensilla (aesthetascs)
from the hermit crab antennule. Each sensillum is packed with up to a few
thousand dendrites that are the olfactory receptor neurons. Note the exuded ball
of dendritic vesicles that form after the sensillum is cut from the antennule.

Single channel current-voltage relationships in symmetrical Nat solutions.
Channels were activated by applying 1 mM cGMP to the inner face of the patch.
Line were fit to the data by linear least squares regression. The different slopes
