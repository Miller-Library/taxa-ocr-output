line shows the linear least squares regression fit to the data. The slope of the line
indicates the conductance of the channel, approximately 86 pS.
Figure 8.
Channel open probability for the 86 pS channel, activated by 1 mM CGMP. Open
probability is defined by mean open time divided by mean closed time using a
50% criterion to define gating transitions. This graph indicates that there is a
voltage dependence of open probability with open probability increasing in the
depolarizing direction.
Figure 9.
Single channel current-voltage relationship for the 86 pS channel activated by 1
mM cGMP. Recordings made in symmetrical Nat solutions as voltage is
increased in a ramp from -50 to +50 mV. Trace A shows channel activity with
many openings before the addition of Ca+t. Trace B is a record of channel
activity after the addition of 10 mM Ca+t to the inner face of the patch. The trace
is very flat indicating a block of all channel activity.

A. Single channel recording in symmetrical Na* solutions. Recording was made
without IP3 and with a pipette voltage of -30 mV. Filtering was done with an 8-
pole bessel filter set at 2 kHz and digitized at 250 us/point. The flat trace
indicates that there is no channel activation in the absence of IP3.
B. Channel activation produced by application of 2 uM IP3 to the inner face of
the patch in symmetrical Nat solutions and with a pipette voltage of -30 mV.
The record was filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 250 us/point. After the
