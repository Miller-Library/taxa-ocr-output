application of IP3 channel activity is noted. Significant flicker behavior is also
present.
C. Current-amplitude distribution histogram from the channel recording above.
The distribution was fit with two gaussian curves with mean amplitudes of O pA
and -O.46 pA. The mean open probability was approximately 0.76.
Figure 11.
Single channel current-voltage relationship in symmetrical Na+ solutions.
Channel activation by application of 2 uM IP3 to the inner face of the patch. Line
fit by linear least squares regression. The slope of the line indicates the
conductance of the channel, approximately 13 pS.
Figure 12.
Channel open probability for the 13 pS channel, activated by 2 uM IP3. Open
probability is defined by mean open time divided by mean closed time using a
50% criterion to define gating transitions. This graph indicates that there is a
voltage dependence of open probability with open probability increasing in the
depolarizing direction.
Figure 13.
Scatter plot of conductance recorded from a multichannel patch with channel
activation by application of 2 uM IP3. The three clusters of conduction values
indicate the possibility of three different channel types with conductances of
approximately 24 pS, 83 pS, and 180 pS. The 24 pS channel noted here may be
the same channel as the 13 pS channel from the single channel patch activated by
IP3.
