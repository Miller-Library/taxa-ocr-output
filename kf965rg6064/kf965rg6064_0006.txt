divided by mean closed time, increased with voltage in the depolarizing
direction.
Ca++ block of 86 pS channel
When 10 mM Ca+t was applied to the inner face of the patch containing
the 86 pS channel, all channel activity was blocked (Fig. 9). For this recording
voltage was increased in a ramp from -50 to +50 mV. There was significant
channel activity in the absence of Ca+t, however upon addition of Ca+t no
channel activity was noted and the trace was flat.
PP3 gated channel of 13 pS
A channel activated by IP3 was obtained in a single channel patch
recording. Trace A of Figure 10 shows a recording from this patch with a pipette
voltage of -30 mV in the absence of IP3. No channel activity was seen in this
condition. Upon the addition of IP3 to the inner face of the patch, significant
channel activity was recorded (Fig. 10 B). The channel demonstrated a
characteristic flicker behavior. Openings occurred in bursts of rapid openings
and closings. The mean unitary current was determined by fitting two gaussian
curves to a current-amplitude distribution histogram (Fig. 10 C). The calculated
average slope conductance was 13 pS (Fig. 11). The slope of the line in the
current-voltage plot in Figure 11 is an approximation of the conductance of the
channel. Conductance was determined by analyzing individual channel
openings from the digitized record and averaging the results. The opening
probability of the channel appeared to be voltage dependent (Fig. 12). Channel
open probability, calculated by mean open time divided by mean closed time,
increased with voltage in the depolarizing direction.
