In lobster, odorants have been shown to increase cAMP levels in the cell, but the
cyclic nucleotide-gated channel has also been shown to have a tenfold greater
sensitivity to cGMP than for cAMP (Ache and Zhainazarov, 1995). This suggests
that both agonists may be involved in signal transduction. cGMP was applied to
patches obtained in this study because of its suggested greater affinity of the
cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and because the role of cGMP in olfaction is not
yet well understood.
In hermit crabs, cGMP was able to initiate and sustain unitary currents in
excised patches, suggesting that the channel was directly gated by cGMP. There
were two cGMP-gated channels with conductances of 22 pS and 86 pS. The 22 pS
channel did not show a voltage dependence of channel open probability. These
results are similar to those obtained from study of the lobster in which a 27 pS
cAMP channel was noted that also did not have a voltage dependence of open
probability. Similar to the recordings obtained from lobster, recordings of
channel activity from hermit crabs show a great deal of flicker behavior in the
open state (Hatt and Ache, 1994).
A CGMP-gated channel of 86 pS was also observed in the hermit crab.
This is a new finding since the work done on lobster did not show any clear
indication of a second cyclic nucleotide gated channel with a larger conductance
(Hatt and Ache, 1994). Unlike the 22 pS channel, the 86 pS channel did show a
voltage dependence of open probability, with channel opening probability
increasing in the depolarizing direction. There is also some suggestion for the
existence of substates in the 86 pS channel although the data are not sufficient to
draw any conclusions on this point.
Addition of IP3 to the excised patches also initiated and sustained unitary
currents suggesting that it directly activates IP3-gated channels. The slope
conductance of the most frequently observed channel was approximately 13 pS.
