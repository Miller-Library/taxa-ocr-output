drawback to this method of observation is occasional dis-
ruption of copulation as the female swings her foot around.
trying to find a substrate in order to right herself. An at-
tempt was made to remedy this problem by allowing the female
to contact a glass plate with her foot while upside down;
however, contact with the plate was followed by a spreading
and flattening of the foot which obscured the view of the penis
and the female's mantle cavity.
When the female is righted, the positionpofithe male
shell during pairing completely obstructs the view of the penis.
Since it is impossible to tell by male shell orientation whether
or not the pair is copulating, field studies of duration or
frequency of copulation are practically impossible. Disruption
of 100 active (extended) pairs in the field revealed only 17 in
which the male's penis was extended, so paired snails cannot
be regarded as always copulating.
Size Ratios in Male-Female Pairs.
A question arises as to what size males will be found with
pairediwithewh√§tssize females in the field, and whether any
selection for size of mate occurs. Figure 6 is a scattergram
of allothefpairseofttwoidifferent Littorina planaxis popula-
tions taken from two different areas, in which the size of
each female is plotted against the size of the male she was
paired with. The method of measurement used for both Figures
