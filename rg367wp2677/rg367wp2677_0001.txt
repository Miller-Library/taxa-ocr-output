Mating Behavior in Littorina planaxis Philippi.

The habitat of the grey periwinkle, Littorina planaxis
Philippi (1847), well above high water on rocky western North
American shores, exposes this snail to desiccating sun and
wind and high temperatures to a greater degree than most other
intertidal organisms (Ricketts and Calvin, 1952). This degree
of exposure presents several problems to the process of re-
production. Fertilization is internal, which requires that
males must have some means of locating females, recognizing
them as such, and mating with them. This paper will attempt
to explore the mating behavior of Littorina planaxis and ex-
plain its method of locating other individuals, differences
in the behavior of males and females, and the anatomy and
mechanics of copulation.
Studies were made at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, Calif., during April and May, 1964. Egg-laying and
copulating individuals were seen throughout this period.
Ricketts and Calvint (1952, p.13) state that some individuals
can be found copulating at any time of year, but spring and
summer seem to be the times for heavy occurrences of mating.
