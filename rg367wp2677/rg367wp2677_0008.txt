Copulation
The trial-and-error behavior displayed by male Littorina
planaxis in finding females suggests that copulation is the
first purpose of pairing, and probably occurs immediately
upon finding the female's genital opening. Figures 5a, b, & c
illustrate insertion of the penis. It is first extended
downward and backward, becoming engorged with blood and
elongating (5a.); as it continues to elongate, the front edge
is pushed into the mantle cavity (5b.); the tip trails in after
the front edge and is eventually inserted in the bursa copu-
latrix (5c.). Involuntary cilia in the penis cause a very
rapid flow of sperm and prostatic secretions down the seminal
groove that can be observed with a dissecting microscope.
The rate of flow here makes it very unlikely that copulation
takes very long, and it has been observed that sperm transfer
is not always occurring during the entire time the penis is
inserted. Of ten cases of copulation observed without disruption,
the longest time the penis remained inserted was 15 minutes,
more usually 4 or 5. The technique of observation was thelcol-
lection of dry, closed pairs stuck together with mucus which
were then placed under seawater with the female on her back.
Under these conditions the snails soon extended themselves,
and the male usually attempted to insert the penis. The only
