A male becomes aggressive if he comes into contact with
another male on the shell he is exploring or intending to
explore. Ten battles resulting from such circumstances have
been observed, lasting between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, con-
sisting of the males jerkily pushing each other with the head
ends of their shells until one is dislodged.. Figure 2. shows
such a battle in progress. In two cases, the snail the fighting
males were on was also a male, but they apparently did not
know it, for the victor in each case attempted copulation with
the snail beneath him.
Often a third snail will be found very close to or touching
two paired individuals. In 50 checks of the sex of this third
individual, 48 were males, 2 females. The proximity of the
second male to the pair might be due to the fact that he has
just been pushed off the female and has not yet left the area,
or it might suggest a chemo-attraction of males to the vicinity
of females.
Normal (heterosexual) pairs persist for quite some time
after formation, often spanning an entire moist-rock activity
period of 10 hours or more. A field study of pairiformation
and persistence over one activity period is shown in Figure 3.
Pairs are seen to form over a wide range of dark and daylight
