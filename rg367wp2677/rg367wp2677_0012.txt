Sex Ratio
As Figure 7 indicates, there are generally more males
than females in the population. A survey of 1000 unpaired
individuals yielded a ratioof two males to each female;
however, when the population as a whole and the large number
of snails that are pairing at any one time are considered,
the balance between the sexes is such that there is probably
little or no significance in the greater number of males
present.
