Locating of Mating Partners
All movement and any subsequent locating of mating
partners in Littorina planaxis occurs when the rocks on which
these winkles are living are moist. This may be at night or
at any time during the day, and may take place even in direct
sunlight. Tide height and wave action are two of the main
factors that govern rock wetness. Males and females follow
mucus trails of other individuals over moist rock, with ap-
parent disregard for the sex of the snail that laid down the
trail they are following, using their cephalic tentacles to
feel their way along (Peters, 1964). Such following of mucus
trails has selective advantage, since it leads winkles to other
winkles, which may be potential mating partners.
Pairing Behavior
Males differ from females in that they immediately climb
upon the shell of any other Littorina planaxis individual
they encounter, usually over the head end of the shell and
often after touching tentacles with the other snail. Once on
the shell, the male will migrate to the right side and insert
his penis into the mantle cavity of the snail beneath him,
assuming the the pairing position shown in Figure 1. This
position is necessary for copulation, since the genitalia in
both sexes are found on the right side, behind the head (for
