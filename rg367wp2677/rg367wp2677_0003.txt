a complete illustration of Littorine anatomy, see Fretter and
Graham, 1962, Chapter 2, pp. 14-48). When the animal below
is a female, copulation may ensue. However, it appears that
success or failure of the tip of the penis in contacting the
bursa copulatrix of the female mantle cavity is the only way
in which a male can tell whether he has encountered a female
or another male. A male exhibits no defensive reaction to
having his mantle cavity explored by the penis of another male,
but the male above will soon climb off and seek another mate
if his probings do not meet with success. Observations were
made of 32 males placed on a moist rock in the laboratory and
watched for an hour and a half. No females were present.
During this time, 12 pairs formed, and the length of time that
each remained in the pairing position was recorded. None of
the male-male pairs observed persisted for more than 8 minutes,
and more than half of them broke up in two minutes or less. Be-

inathe absence ofmales under the above conditions yielded no
pairing or climbing on one another's shells.
This apparent trial-and-error methodcof finding a mate
could be of great selective advantage in the range where Lit
torina planaxis lives.
