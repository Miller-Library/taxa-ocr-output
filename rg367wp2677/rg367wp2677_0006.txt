hours, and are seen to persist for greatly varying lengths
of time. A certain percentage of snails are to be found
paired, with different partners, more than once during the same
activity period, as Figure 3. also shows.
The amount of pairing occurring at any time in the field
seems to be affected by the level of the tide. Figure 4. shows
two pairing frequency studies made over 25-hour tide cycles
a week apart, in order to show that the time shift in the tide
level causes a concomitant shift in the time of day that the
greatest and least numbers of individuals are paired. The
area observed was about 1 meter square in area, containing
about 100 Littorina planaxis individuals. Each hour the num-
ber of pairs and single winkles in the area was counted, the
percentage pairing calculated, and plotted. The second week,
as the tide came in later in the day, pairing percentage also
peaked later. In both studies, pairing percentage rose as
the tide came in, and then began to fall as the tide rose further.
An increasing amount of splash, capable of dislodging paired
snails, since in a pair only the female's foot is attached to
the substrate, may account for this.
