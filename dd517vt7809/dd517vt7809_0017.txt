would like to thank Dr. Stuart Thompson for his helpful advice and
ideas and for teaching me the techniques involved in Doriopsilla dissection
and intracellular recording. Also, I would like to thank Drs Baxter, Epel,
Swezeu, and Dennu, the postdoctoral fellows and graduate student in the
Thompson lab, and Tiffanu Tom for their advice and concern, and Tom Utis
