Forskolin was expected to behave in a wag similar to TEA. It was
expected to lead to increases in cAMP dependent protein kinase which
would phosphorglate voltage dependent K* channels thus blocking them,
leading to a result similar to that observed when TEA is added. The
increase in resting potential observed when forskolin was added is similar
to the effect observed in TEA solution and mag be the result of decreased
Kt conductance. The increase in action potential width also agrees with
the possibilitu that K* channels were blocked. The decrease in injected
current needed to produce cell spiking mag imply that forskolin lowers the
threshold voltage of cells. However, it mag also be an artifact resulting
from the incresse in resting potential of the cell when exposed to the drug.
Hore experiments must be done to confirm which of the two is correct. In
the literature, there is no mention of forskolin affecting threshold
voltages of cells.
Since forskolin has been observed to have effects other than those
mediated bu CAMP, such as changes in A current or transient K* current,
chlorophenulthiol CAMP, a membrane permeable cAMP analog, was used to
tru to duplicate its effects and separate which effects were CAMP
mediated and which were not. 1 micromolar concentrations were used and
no changes in spike height, width, or frequency were observed. It is
possible that changing CAMP levels has no effect on action potential shape
or frequency in Doriopsilla although this seems verg unlikelg, since cAHF
is such a ubiquitous second messenger and has been shown to affect spike
shape in Aplusia neurons. The more likelg possibilitg is that 1 nH
concentrations of CPT CAMP are too low to cause an effect. Higher
concentrations should be used for further experimentation.
