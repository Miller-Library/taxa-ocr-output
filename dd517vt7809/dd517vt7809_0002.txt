Introduction
It has been hupothesized that second messengers plag a role in
changing rates of ion currents in neurons thus changing action potential
shape resulting in different amounts of transmitter released from
sunaptic terminals. Klein and Kandel have suggested a model where CAMP
levels may control sensitization in Aplysia gill withdrawal response.
Accordinq to this model, serotonin binding to receptors activates
adenulate cuclase leading to an increase in cAMP levels in the presynaptic
terminal of the sensoru neuron. CAMP activates a cAMP-dependent protein
kinase which phosphorglates a voltage sensitive K* channel, inactivating
it. The subsequent decrease in K' current prolongs the time of
depolarization during action potentials, allowing more calcium jons to
enter with the result that more transmitter is released from the terminal
(1). Castellucci et al. (2) and Kaczmarek et al. (3) have injected the
catalutic subunit of bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase into Aplusia
sensory neurons and bag cells respectivelg. Action potential height and
width were incressed. Results seem to indicate an increase in Ca¬
current and a decrease in K' current were responsible for this effect.
TPA (12-0-tetradecanoul-phorbol-13 -acetate), a tumor promoting
phorbol ester, has also been reported to increase action potential height in
Aplusia bag cells. Presumably, it acts by mimicing the effects of
diszoglucerol which activates protein kinase C. Injection of purified
protein kinase C also increases action potential height by increasing Ca¬
current (4). Ca channels may be phosphorglated by this kinase thus
bringing more channels from an inactive to an active state.
