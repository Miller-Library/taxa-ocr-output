In this paper, the effects of forskolin, chlorophenglthiol cAMP, and
TPA on action potential shape in the mollusc Doriopsilla albopunctata
were studied. Forskolin is a membrane soluble diterpene which stimulates
the increase of cAMP levels by activating adenglate cyclase. It also seems
to have the effect of increasing the slow inward Na' current in molluscan
neurons which is not medisted by CAMP (5). CPT CAMP is a nonhgdolyzable
membrane permeable analog of cAMP. To try to determine what types of
currents were affected bu each of the chemicals, action potentials were
observed in solutions where Na ions were removed, Ca ions were removed,
or tetraethulammonium ions (TEA) was added. This allowed the
observation of action potentials with certain currents blocked.
