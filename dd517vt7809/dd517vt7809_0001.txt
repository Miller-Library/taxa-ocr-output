Abstract
The shapes and frequencies of action potentials of Doriopsilla
albopunctata neuronal soma were studied in artificial sea water (ASW),
and ASW solutions that were Na -free, Caz-free with Co¬, or with
tetraethylammonium jons (TEA). Action potentials were also measured in
ASW solutions containing 67 micromolar forskolin, 1 micromolar
chlorophenylthiol CAMP (CPT CAMP), or 50 nanomolar
tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate (TPA).
The Nat-free, Ca2-free Co2*, and TEA solutions were used to study
action potentials missing Na’, Caz*, and K' currents respectively.
Na’-free solution caused action potentials to decrease in amplitude and
increase in width. Action potentials became slight undulations or sine
wave like. Ca2'-free solution removed repetitive firing. Potentials also
lost amplitude and gained width. TEA removed the undershoot of
hyperpolarization as well as increased the width of action potentials. he
addition of both TEA and Ca2-free Co2 solutions to cells produced and
two stage effect where the voltage fluctuated between a resting potential
and a potential 40 mV above rest.
Forskolin and CPT CAMP were used to observe the putative effects of
CAMP on action potentials. Forskolin increased action potential width and
seemed to decrease threshold voltage. CPT CAMP had no observable
effects. TPA was used to determine the putative effects of diazoglycerol.
It seemed to decrease threshold voltage in Na free solution.
These results suggest that action potential shape is determined by
varjous current components and that second messengers may affect action
potential shape by blocking or enhancing certain currents.
