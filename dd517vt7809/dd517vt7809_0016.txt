Conclusions
Although the results of this experiment are far from conclusive, it
seems likelu, from the current literature, and from some results here, that
second messengers do have an effect on action potential shape, frequencg,
or threshold. Neurons do not just passivelg transmit action potentials. Il
this were the case, learning and memorg would not occur. Neurons must
integrate and modifu the information that is transmitted to them. Second
messengers, among other things, seem to plag a role in this moditication.
Using second messengers, models for simple forms of learning, such as the
Klein and Kandel model for Aplusia sensitization, can be made. Therefore,
the effects that second messengers have on neurons should be f√ºrther
studied.
