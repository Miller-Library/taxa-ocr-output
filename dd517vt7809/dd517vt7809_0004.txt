Materials and Hethods
Doriopsilla albopunctata were obtained from Tom Otis who dove foi
them in the Monterey Bay area. They were kept in a tank through which
filtered sea water was continuouslg run through. The sea water was put
through a degassifier which consisted of a tube filled with plastic beads
in order to prevent gas from coming out of solution inside the animals due
to the difference in temperature between the sea and the tank.
Preparation of Brains
Doriopsilla brains were dissected by making two incisions from the
gill to each rhinophore using scissors. The flap of skin was pulled up
exposing the brain which could be easilg identified because of its orange
color, two black eues that were attached to it, and because of its position
between and slightlu posterior to the rhinophores. The brain and
surrounding muscle tissue were removed using fine scissors and pinned to
a petri dish with a silgard base. They were then rinsed in an artificial sea
water solution (ASW) (see Table 1). Excess tissue such as salivarg gland
tissue was removed using fine forceps. Next, the brain was treated with a
small amount of dispase, covered with a small piece of kimwipe to
preserve moisture and incubated for 1 hour at 4 degrees centigrade. he
dispsse was rinsed off and the brain was incubsted for at lesst 2 hours in
artificial sea water also at 4 degrees centigrade. This procedure loosened
the epineurial sheath surrounding the ganglions. The sheath was later torn
off using fine forceps.
