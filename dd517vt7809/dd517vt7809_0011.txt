The summation of the voltages during a spike in Na“-free and a spike
in Ca2t-free solutions does not result in the shape of a "normal“ action
potential in ASW. This indicates that another factor is necessarg for
achieving action potential shape. This factor mag be the negative or
positive feedback that the currents experience as a result of the change in
potential. As the voltage increases, the probability or a Cazt or Na
channel being open also increases. Ädding the spikes observed in Na“-free
and Ca2t-free solutions increases the voltage which in turn changes Na
and Ca2t currents. To obtain a normal action potential shape by the
addition of Nat and Ca2* currents, these currents should be measured at
voltages ranging from resting potential to maximum spike height. As the
Nat-free curves and the Ca2t-free curves are added to form a higher
voltage, the Nat and Ca2* curves for the new voltage should be used to
continue
Tetraethul ammonium ions block K* current. The addition of IEA
decreased the rate of hyperpolarization during an action potential as
would be expected if K* current was hindered. The slowed
huperpolarization that remained was probebly caused by the inactivation
of Nat and Ca2t current. The undershoot at the end of an action potential
was abolished. This also was expected since this is caused by increased
Ktcurrent. The slight lowering of the peak of the action potential was not
expected and does not seem to be a result of the direct action of the K*
ions. It can be explained indirectly by the result that adding TEA reduces
some resting Kt current resulting in an increased resting potential (a 5
my increase in resting potential was observed when cells were in TEA
solution). This increased resting potential mag prevent some of the Na
