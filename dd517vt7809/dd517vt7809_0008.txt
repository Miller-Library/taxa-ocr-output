cells were treated with forskolin, the lower voltage produced action
potentials as well as repetitive firing if maintained while the higher
current pulses produced a weaker action potential followed by inhibition
of firing. This effect was observed in all four trials but the results mag
be misleadinq since in all cases the same current pulses were used
regardless of resting potential height. Since forskolin raised action
potential levels, injecting equivalent currents mag not have resulted in
same absolute voltages compared to controls. Only in one case was the
cell huperpolarized to its previous resting potential before being tested.
This cell acted in the same way as the others.
Forskolin consistently increased the width at half maximal height of
action potentials: from 10 mS to 30 mS. It consistently caused a décrease
in height of action potentials: from 85 mY from peak to bottom of
huperpolarization to 65 mV, and in one out of four trials, it noticeably
increased action potential frequency during a stimulus.
CPI CAMP was added in concentrations of 1 micromolar. At this
concentration, no effects were observed measuring action potential
frequencu, height, or width. Resistance of the cell also did not change.
Four experiments were done with CPT CAMP. All gielded the same results.
Adding TPA at a concentration of 50 nH to cells in ASW produced no
noticeable effect on action potential frequency and no consisted etfects on
action potential height or width. Adding TPA to cells in Na'-free sea
water stimulated action potential production over control levels at low
voltages. Cells in Na’-free sea water had resting potentials of
approximatelu -70 mV. At this potential, pulses of up to 5 nA produced no
action potentials in control cells. Cells treated with TPA however,
produced low frequency firing as a result of these pulses. When cells were
depolarized to higher resting potentials, ie. the resting potential of the
