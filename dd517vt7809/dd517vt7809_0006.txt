Figure 1. shows control action potentials in normal artificial sea
water. Cells had resting potentials between -20 and -50 mV. The peaks of
action potentials were between 130 and 150 mV. Cells fired repetitivelu
when stimulated by long current injections.
In Na -free solution, the resting potentials consistently became
more negative to approximately -70 mV. During the replacement of ASW
with Na -free, spike frequency decreased, spike height decreased, and
spike width incressed. The rate of voltage increase of the rising phase of
the action potential decreased and the rate of voltage decrease of the
falling phase decreased. When perfusion was completed, repetitive firing
was either abolished after the first action potential or verg slight
undulations followed the first action potential. Figure 2. shows action
potentjals in Naâ€™-free solution. The upper traces show an action potential
during perfusion, and the lower traces show an action potential after
perfusion was complete. These effects were all reversible by washing
with ASW.
The effects of Ca+-free Co* solution is shown in Figure 3. Spike
height was decreased and spike width increased although not as much as in
Na'-free solution. Repetitive firing was decreased with a long current
pulse causing two spikes, the second much shorter and wider than the
first, and then a flat line.
TEA caused a major incresse in the width of action potentials.
Action potential width at half maximal height changed from control values
of approximatelu 12 mS to approximately 180 mS. Resting potential
became more positive by approximately 5 mV, and peak action potential
