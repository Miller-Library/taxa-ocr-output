Intracellular Recordings
Recordings were done on either the three large cells of the pedal
ganglions or the large posterior cells in the pleural ganglions. Iwo
electrodes filled with 3 molar KCI with resistances of between 2 and 15
megachms were inserted into the cells using manipulators. The electodes
were connected to amplifiers. One electrode was used to regulate current,
while the second was used to record voltage. Current and voltage were
monitored using an oscilloscope, and a computer was used to program
current pulses. During the recording procedure, the brain was pinned in a
perfusion dish on a cooling plate at about 15 degrees centigrade. The
perfusion dish was designed so that the bathing solution could be changed
while keeping the brain totally immersed with minimal damage to the
cells. The insertion of the electrodes was done under a light microscope
at a magnification of 500 times.
Bathing Solutions
Na'-free, Ca-free Co-*, and TEA solutions are listed in Table 1.
Half Ca2-free Co*, half TEA solution was made by mixing equal volumes
of Ca2-free Co* and TEA solutions. TPA was made in a 50 micromolar
stock solution in dimethul sulfoxide (DHSO) and added to the cells so that
the final concentration was 50 nanomolar. Forskolin was stored as a 10
millimolar stock in DHSO and used at a final concentration of 67
micromolar. Stock CPT CAMP was 1 millimolar in distilled water. It was
used at a final concentration of 1 micromolar. Solutions were added to the
cells by perfusion. Chemicals were added directly into the bathing
solution and wash out by perfusion.
