The effects of TPA in Nat-free sea water indicate that TPA lowers
the threshold voltage of a cell. Spiking occurs in the presence of TPA at
voltages where in its absence, it does not occur. However, at voltages
where spiking occurs in both, frequency remains unchanged. In ASW,
observations were only made at voltages where spiking occurred in both
cases. Threshold was not measured so further experiments will have to be
done to see if the lowering of threshold voltages occurs in ASW as well as
Nat-free sea water. An incresse in spike height and width such as has
been observed in Aplusia neurons was not observed. A possible explanation
for the decreased threshold voltage observed in Nat-free solution with
IPA is that TPA activates protein kinase C which phosphorglates Caz
channels bringing them from the inactive to closed state. This increases
the number of Ca2t channels that may be opened. Although the probability
of ang one channel being open at a particular voltage mag not change, since
there are more channels available, more of them will be open at a
particular voltage thus lowering threshold, similar to the idea that the
threshold voltage is lower at the spike initiating zone because there is a
higher concentration of Nat channels there.
