Discussion
It has been observed that in molluscan cell soma, the major currents
involved during action potentials are carried by Na“, Ca2*, and K* ions (6).
Hat and Ca2t currents are necessarg for the rising phase as Na“ and Laz-
jons enter the cell and Kt ions leaving the cell account for the subsequent
huperpolarization during the potential. The experiments in which Nar¬
free. Ca2t-free, and TEA sea water were used to observe action potentials
in the selective absence of these ions seems to verify this. In all cases,
action potential shape was changed drastically. In Na“-free solution, the
sine wave like undulations indicate that Ca2* current has a slower
activation and a slower deactivation than Hat current. The repetitions of
the undulations seems to indicate that in these cells, Ca¬* current may be
necessary for repetitive firing. In contrast, with the Cazt free solution,
Nat current turned on rapidly and deactivated rapidlg. The difference in
the time it takes from the peak of the action potential to the
repolarization is different. Since K* current should be the same in both
cases, this difference can be accounted for by the rapid deectivation of the
Nat channels. In Ca2t-free solution, there are one or two sharp action
potentials followed by a flat line. This seems to indicate that Ha“ current
bu itself cannot maintain repetitive firing. A verg simplified model of an
action potential would be that the Na* current plays a major role in the
quick upward and downward slopes of the spikes while Caz* current plags
a major role in the repetition of the spikes.
