abolished (see Figure 4.).
When the TEA solution and Ca--free Co* solution were mixed, an
interesting effect was observed in besting cells, shown in Figure 5.
Following a spike, a cell never huperpolarized back to resting potential but
huperpolarized to a voltage approximately 40 mV obove rest. A verg weck

during which the voltage was slowlg but consistently decreasing. After
reaching a certain voltage, slight action potential like spikes began
appearing growing in size (both action potential peak voltage was rising
and lowest voltage was becoming more negative). Äfter these potentials
resched a certain height, voltage returned to resting potential. This
process was repeated in a beater like fashion. At resting potential, a
definite membrane resistance could be measured but during the time that
the cell was at the 40 mV above the resting stage, membrane resistance,
as messured by injecting a huperpolarizing current, decreased to the
extent that a 1 nA injected current had an immeasurable effect on voltage.
The addition of ASW to the TEA/Ca-free Co
2 solution decreased the
amount of time spent in the higher voltage state. It could also abolish the
higher voltage state totally and insteed, make the cell fire repetitivelg for
a short interval followed bu an interval where the cell did not fire
spontaneously similar to a bursting pacemaker cell.
Forskolin increased resting potential (ie. from -22 to -12.9 mV) and
in some cases may have increased action potential frequency. Action
potential width at half meximal height was increased approximatelg 300
percent. Observations were made where low current pulses (ie. 1 nA) did
not change voltage in control (ASW) cells while higher current pulses (ie. 5
né) produced action potentials and repetitive firing if maintained. Atter
