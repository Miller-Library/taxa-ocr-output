Figure 1. Action potentials in ASW. Upper trace is injected current; lower
trace is voltage.
Figure 2. Action potentials in Na free sea water. The upper two traces are
input current and voltage measured during perfusion to replace ASW
with Na free sea water. The lower traces are input current and
voltage measured after perfusion was complete.
Figure 3. Effects of Ca free Co sea water on action potentials. The upper
two sets of current and voltage traces show input current and action
potentials in ASW. The lower sets show input current and action
potentials in Ca free Co solution.
Figure 4. Action potential in TEA containing sea water. Upper trace is
current; lower trace is voltage.
Figure 5. Action potentials in a mixture of Ca free Co sea water and sea
water containing TEA. The upper two voltage traces show the two
different states that the voltage fluctuated between: resting voltage,
and 40 mV above resting. The lowest voltage trace shows how
diluting the Ca free Co and TEA mixture with ASW results in a burster
like activity of the cell.
Figure 6. Effect of forskolin on action potentials. The upper two traces
are current and voltage in ASW. The lower two are current and
voltage in ASW with forskolin added.
Figure 7. The effect of TPA in Na free sea water with resting voltage at -
70 mV. The upper two traces are current and voltage in Na free
solution without TPA. The lower two traces are current and voltage
in Na free solution with TPA.
Figure 8. The effect of TPA in Na free sea water with resting voltage
depolarized to -50 mV. Upper two traces are in Na free solution -
TPA; lower two are in Na free solution +TPA.
