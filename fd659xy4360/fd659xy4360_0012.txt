ACKNOVLEDGEMENTS
I would like to express my appreciation for the incredible students
and staff of Hopkins Marine Station. Special thanks go to D.P.A., the
Little Tomatoe and her friend, the Little Cabbage, the H.A.M., and most
of all, Dr. Zelmo Burnett, for his constant inspiration and guidance.
"I thank the P.G.J.H. for
Use of their gym
And God for the
Sunlight.
And Larry for being around to insult
And Tigriopus for going into bottles'
-R.B.
