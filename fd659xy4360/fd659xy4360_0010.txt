GENERAL DISCUSSION
The extraordinary results obtained by flowing sea water into a tide
pool inhabited by Tigriopus suggest that migration is an important aspect
of their ecology. The fact that no copulating pairs were found to migrate
in the courtyard pool and the observation that copulating pairs were found
in the channel with naturally occurring migrators suggests that the individuals
in the channel had been washed out of the high tide pool and some (eleven
gravid females) were in the process of returning to that pool. If this is
so, then perhaps migration is a mechanism by which Tigriopus maintains
populations in the high tide pools in spite of rain or splash.
The finding that Tigriopus would not migrate in a solution of unfiltered
synthetic salts clearly indicates that the copepods are reacting to some
factors in addition to the stimulus of moving water. Both the affinity
studies and those which observed migration in artificial pools involved
the ability of animals to detect and react to certain factors in the water,
The results using the stimulus of migrated individuals or tide pool rocks
were duplicated in both types of experiments. It seems reasonable therefore,
to apply the results of the affinity studies to the biology and ecology of
migration.
Some of the factors act clearly as deterents. Burnett has found that
migrating Ti
piopus have a dramatic negative response to macerated individuals.
This supports the results of Run Number 1 and seems to indicate that the
results of Run Number 2 are either artifactual or due to methodology. A.
elegantissima may also be a deterent. However, the fact that copepods are
responding negatively to macerated individuals indicates that they may be
able to detect predation in a tide pool and thus avoid either the predator,
the tide pool or both. This would be an extremely valuable adaptarion to
life in high tide pools ard deserves further examination.
