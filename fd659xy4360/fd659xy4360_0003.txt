than that of undyed individuals. Burnett (personal communication) also
found that a number of factors including the presence of tide pool rocks
and macerated Tigriopus californicus have profound effects upon migration.
In the spring of 1977, work was done at Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, California, on the migration of T. californicus and on the
factors that influence it. The results of these studies are reported
here.
A. GENERAL OBS
SERVATIONS (LAB AND FIELD WORK)
Migration was induced in the field by trickling sea water over the
rocks into two different tide pools. A circular holding tank, six meters
in diameter, (hereafter called the courtyard pool or C.Y.P.) populated
with Tigriopus was used to examine sex ratios. (see Fig. 1) Fresh water
from the sea water system was trickled down a region of the tank's walls
and copepods were allowed to migrate up the rivulet. The animals aggregated
underneath a glass plate which serves to deflect water from a spigot down
the vertical wall (see Fig. 2). Samples were taken from this aggregation
and from the water column of the pool for sex determination according to
Fraser (1136).
RESULT
During a heavy rain all the pools in the study area were observed
to overflow. After the rains ceased, over forty individual Tigriopus,
including three copulating pairs, were seen in a long narrow channel
mnecting three tide pools. The movements of eleven closely watched animals
were judged to be migratory since they were not accompanied by the random
