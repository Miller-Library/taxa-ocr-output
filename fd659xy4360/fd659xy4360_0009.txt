Pach flask was filled with 55 o/00 filtered synthetic sea-salts bafore placeÂ¬
ment in the C.Y.P. unless otherwise indicated.
Results: Run Number 2
The average values obtained for each flask and the rasults of statistical
analysis on noteworthy test cases are listed in Table VI.
Discussion: Run Number 2
The results of the first three test cases support those obtained in
Run Number 1.
The second three test cases listed in Table VI support the hypothesis
that the animals are reacting to some type of organic material. This material
is partially heat labile and partially solvent soluble. It may be that the
copepods are reacting to a number of organic constituents in the water.
The difference between filtered synthetic sea salts and courtyard water
is not significant. This may be an indication that the copepods wera
reacting negatively to some factor in the unfiltered sea salts of run Number 1.
Millipore (.45u) filtered and unfiltered courtyard pool waters were
not significantly different. This result is not surprising since this type
of filtration will remove only relatively small particles and not chemical
compounds.
Finally, it is interesting to note in run Number 2, that Tigriopus
juice is not significantly different from control. However, it was a
significant difference in Run Number 1. These experiments need to be run
again simultaneously to determine whether or not the different results are
due to methodology.
