D. AFFINITY STUDIES IN THE COUI
ARD POOL
Materials and Methods
Five 300 ml Frelenmeyer flasks, and eight 125 ml ground stoppered
bottles containing various physical and chemical stimuli were placed on the
bottom of the courtyard pool. After a period of time all the flasks were
retrieved. Numbers of individuals per flask were counted in the lab. (See
Table III for the contents of the various flasks and bottles.) The
living stimuli (flasks 2 to 5) were retained within plastic vials with fins
plankton netting covering the open end. These vials were then deposited
in their respective flasks. Each flask and bottle, unless otherwise noted,
was filled with 34 sea water before placement in the courtyard pool.
Orientation within the replicate groups was constant and is shown in Figure
6 along with the location of each group.
Results: Run Number 1
An R by C contingency test on the results (see appendix 1) gives a
value of 99, indicating that variations between the replicate groups existed
and were not controlled. Therefore only test cases run adjacent to each
other were examined for significant differences. Such test cases are listed
in Table IV.
Discussion: Run Number 1
There are significantly less animals in A. elegantissima and tiger juice
than in control. The specific stimulus for each reaction may be the same
since the individual anenomes had, just prior to the experiment, been fed
