minutes. Counts were made to determine tha number of animals migrating per
minute past a given point. The flow was then instantanecusly changed and
counts were resumed after a one minute equilibration period. In each
case the average number of animals migrating per minute during a five
minute period immediately after the change in flow rate was divided by the
average number of animals migrating per minute during the five minutes
immediately before the change. Thus, a relative migration rate was calculated
and could be compared with values obtained on different days and at different
times.
See Fig. 3 ยง 4 for overall trends in migration rates. Indicated slope
values were obtained using linear regression, however the fit was extremely
pocr in each case.
Migration could not be induced in this study using solutions of
unfiltered synthetic sea salts (Instant Ocean) (34). Yet sea water at
the same flow rate induced significant migration with 5 minutes of the
Instant Ocean attempt. The fact that a solution of synthetic sea salts
would not induce migration while sea water would suggests that in addition
to the stimulus of moving water, some other factors, perhaps biotic, are
necessary for migration to occur.
C. HIGRATION IN ARTIFICTAL POOLS. THE AFFECTS OF BIOTIC STIMULI
terials and Method.
Two sets of artificial pools were constructed using cement and chicken
wire (see Fig. 6). Each set consisted of a series of three successively
lower pools connected by narrow channels. Both sats of pools were run
simultaneously with equal flow rates. Temporal variation in migration was
controlled for in the following manner: the ratio of simultaneously run
