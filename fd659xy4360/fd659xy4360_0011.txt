A number of factors were observed to act as attractants. The results
from tide pool rocks with different treatments and from tide pool and terrestrial
rocks indicate that Tigriopus can detect whether or not water in a rivulet
is coming from a tide pool. Such an adaptation may prevent individuals from
migrating to a pool that is non-existent.
Although his work was scmething less than rigorous, Bozic ((175) found
that Tigriopus fulvus are mutually attracted. Tigriopus californicus are
attracted to migrated individuals. Perhaps the migrated individuals are
more sensitive to a variety of stimuli and serve as leaders which the general
population is then able to cue upon. If correct, this would also be a
way in which migrations are directed to suitable ervironments.
These types of experiments exhibit a great potential for use in
uncovering the various biological and chemical processes involved in
migration, as well as explaining the heterogeneous distributions of
iopus within a tide pool, and should therefore be exploited.
