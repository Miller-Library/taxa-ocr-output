migrations without stimulus in either set (control) is compared to the ratio
of simultaneously run migrations with a stimulus in one set only. Animals
were placed in the pool of each set and allowed to acclimatize for eight
hours before water from the sea water system was flowed into each high
pool, for 5 to 7 hours. At the end of the experiment all individuals were
retrieved from the two higher pools using a portable vaccuum pump and taken
to the lab for counting.
A total of four migration runs were made. In the first run no stimulus
was placed in either set of pools (control I). A second and third run each
utilized a different stimulus. Stimulus 1 consisted of two large rocks that
were taken from a tide pocl occupied by Tigriopus. Stimulus 2 consisted
of about 500 individual Tigriopus that migrated into the high pools of the
series during the previous experiments. They were confined to the pool
within two interlocking tea strainers, having a mesh small enough to retain
adults. A fourth run, again without any stimulus in either pool, was done
to ensure that the relative migration lability of the pools had not changed.
Results
The data shown in table 2 shows a significant increase in migration
with the addition of either tide pool rocks or migrated Tigriopus californicus,
Discussion
Migration is enchanced by the presence, in the water, of factors
iopus and tide pool rocks. These factors are
associated with both Ti
not necessarily tha same but perhaps may be the result of the plant or
animal life that is associated with each stimulus.
