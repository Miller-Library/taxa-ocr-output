INTRODUCTION
Tigriopus is a genus of harpacticoid copspods that inhabits the high
splash zone pools of rocky coasts along Europe, both coasts of North and
South America and Japan (Lang, 1948; Mori, 1938). It is thought to exist
as a breeding population in thase isolated pools and virtually every pool
which is a suitable habitat contains these animals. Yet individual pools
can evaporate to dryness for a sufficient time that the entire population
in that pool dies. (Patterson, 1968; Egloff 1966). Igarashi (1959)
showed that populations of Tigriopus japonicus are largely destroyed by
exposure to wave shock during spring tides. Vittor (1971) states that
"colonization of pools is probably accomplished via inshore current
transport of animals swept from pools which are essentially permanently
populated." However, Vittor was unable to document such an occurance,
Egloff (1966) found numbers of Tigriopus californicus clinging to Pachygrapsus
pas and hypothesized that the copepods are able to move among the
ass
tidepools by clinging to the highly mobile crabs.
Migration, the movement of individuals up a slow moving rivulet of
water, as opposed to transport via large animals or inshore currents, is
a phencmenon first observed in Tigriopus californicus by Robin Burnett
(personal communication) and may serve as an important mechanism by which
they colonize and maintain populations in the high tide pools. Dianne
Campbell (1977) observed movements of dyed Tigricpus californicus among
a series of nine sheltered tide pools which received only occasional
splash. She concluded that the movement of dyed copepods among these pools
was due to migration. Foster (1977) subsequently showed that the ability
igricpus califcrnicus to migrate in the lab is significantly less
of dyed Ti
