changes in direction common to normal
gricpus movement but rather
consisted of sustained movement against the slow flow of water coming
down from a higher pool.
The induced migrations occurred with substantially larger numbers.
Plow rates of approximataly 80 ml/mir. were used. Maximum migration
rate out of both pools was about 200 individuals/min.
An extreme difference was found between the sex ratios of random and
migrated Tigriopus californicus. No copulating pairs were observed to
have migrated while gravid females were the dominant migrators. (see Table I)
Of the ten times migration was observed in the courtyard pool, the
first migrating individual was observed to be a gravid female eight times.
Discussion
The sex ratios of migrated and random individuals suggests that females.
especially gravid ones, are either more sensitive to stimulus or physically
superior to males, larvae and copulating pairs.
B. EFFECTS OF FLOW RATE UPON MIGRATION
A small wooden enclosure overhanging the courtyard pool was lined with
black plastic to keep light and wind constant. (see Figs. 1 ยง 2). A
migration ramp made of frosted glass was laid flush against the inside
of the vertical cyp wall. Flow was confined to a uniform area on the
migration ramp by two parallel strips of plexiglass with a microscope slide
used below the source of water as a "spreader",
Migration rates were found to exhibit great temporal variation. In
order to counteract this variation the following procedure was employed;
A standard flow rate of 48 ml/min. was allowed to run for at least five
