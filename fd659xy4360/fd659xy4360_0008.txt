Tigriopus. Or, the copepods may be detecting the presence of Anthopleura
itself.
The fact that migrated Tigriopus were a positive stimulus when compared
to the random individuals is interesting. Perhaps this is a result of the
increased number of gravid females in the stimulus sample (see I results).
Possibly the general population cues on the presence of gravid females who
are more sensitive to a variety of environmental conditions. This hypothesis
can and should be investigated by examining the sex ratios of animals
responding to the different chemical stimuli,
Tigriopus preferred the darkened bottle to the control under the
conditions of this experiment. Possible explanations for such a behavior are
too varied and a hypothesis is not here presented. (See Glaser, 1977;
Miyakawa, 1977; Koch, 1977). However, the results were dramatic and rot
only indicate that lighting may have important effects upon migration but
that it should be carefully controlled in future experiments.
The tide pool and terrestrial rocks had similar texture yet the copepods
were found more with the tide pool rocks. Tigriopus preferred courtyard
pool water to isotonic unfiltered synthetic sea salts. The animals may be
responding positively to some organic component of the courtyard water or
negatively to some factor in the sea salts,
laterials and Methods: Run Number 2
Thirty-five 250 ml Erelenmeyer flasks were placed randomly within a
1 meter square area on the bottom of the C.Y.P. See Table V and Figure 6
for the contents and location of the flasks. Six replicates of the filtered
synthetic sea-salt control and five replicates of the C.Y.P. water were
used. All other variables were run in triplicate. Flasks containing live
specimens as stimuli were prepared in the same manner as in Run Numbery,
