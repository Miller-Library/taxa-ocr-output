-6-
and 100 ppb DDT. The cultures were re-injected with DDT
every six hours. At time 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours, sub¬
samples were taken from each flask, and tested for cell den-
sity (Table II), rate of photosynthesis using the Cjl meth-
od (Table III), and the amount of chlorophyll A/25 ml.
(Table IV). The Cju method was the same as described above
with the exception that 125 ml. samples were used in reagent
bottles instead of 300 ml. samples in B.O.D. bottles.
Experiment 4.
Experiment 4 was designed to determine the effect of
DDT on the rate of chlorophyll A synthesis in exponentially
growing cultures of natural phytoplankton samples. Cultures
were kept in 500 ml. round bottomed flasks, in 300 mls. of
enriched filtered sea water broth. Florometer readings were
made every 12 hours for a 40 hour period on 25ml. sub-sam¬
ples. The results are summarized in Figure 5.
Experiment 5.
A final experiment was conducted to test the inhibitory
nature of DDE, the most common analog of DDT in the natural
environment. Three hundred ml. B.O.D. bottles were filled
with sea water, filtered through a.45u millipore filter, and
inoculated with 50 ml. samples of a concentrated natural
phytoplankton sample. The cultures were brought to 1, 10.
and 100 ppb concentrations of DDE, and innoculated with Ca)
(50 ), (5uc/ml. NaC03). Two controls were run, one with
DDT and one with ethanol. The bottles were incubated for
six hours, filtered and counted. The results are presented
