Experiment 2.
Based on the results of Experiment 1, three concentra¬
tions of DDT, 10, 50, and 100 ppb, were chosen to continue
the study. These were selected because they were relatively
low concentrations of DDT, yet produced clearly discernable
effects on the rate of photosynthesis. Sunsequent testing
confirmed the initial observation that these concentrations
were not lethal to phytoplankton cells. Figures 2 and 3 show
the % dead of cells exposed to these concentrations continu¬
ously over a 96 hour time period. Figure 2 shows the effects
on a pure, uni-alga culture of the dinoflagellate species,
Dunaliella; and Figure 3 shows the effects on a natural pop¬
ulation made up of primarily Nitzchia, Chaetocerous (2 species)
and four or five other diatomsspecies in lesser numbers.
The composition of the culture remained consistant through-
out the study, with only small variations from day to day.
Experiment 3.
Experiment 3 was conducted to establish the long term
effects of DDT on phytoplankton. Four five-liter erlenmeyer
flasks, filled with three liters each of an enriched sea water
broth, were inoculated with a concentrated natural popula-
tion sample to bring the cell density in each flask to ap-
proximately 2.2 x102 cells/ml. Each flask was then exposed
to constant light intensity of 60 footcandles, intermittant
mixing, and a constant temperature of 12°0. After a 24 hour
adjustment period, the flasks were injected with stock
solution DDT to bring their overall concentrations to 10, 50,
