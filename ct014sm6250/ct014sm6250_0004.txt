a no. 25 phytoplankton net at depths of approximately 15
meters. These phytoplankton samples were also protected
from direct sunlight and kept in glass jars on ice ap-
proximately 1.5 hours before utilization in the laboratory.
The effects of DDT on photosynthetic rates were
measured using two different procedures. The first was the
light-dark bottle method as described by Gran (1927) and
modified by Strickland and Parsons (1968). This pro-
cedure utilized 300 ml. B.O.D. bottles of whole water sam-
ples. In the laboratory, they were inoculated with various
concentrations of DDT. A light bottle and a dark bottle,
wrapped four times with black electrical tape to exclude all
light, were used for each concentration. An initial B.O.D.
bottle was analyzed for O2 concentration to establish the
oxygen content of the water. The bottles were incubated
under flugrescent lighting for six hours. At the end of the
incubation time, they were analyzed for 0 production or
consumption by the Winkler method, as modified by Strickland
and Parsons (1968). The second procedure for photosynthetic
rate determination was the C-uptake method as described by
Strickland and Parsons (1968). Again whole water samples were
used, treated, and incubated in the same manner as those
in the O production method, with the exception that each
bottle received 50 of 5uc/ml radioactive NaC0. At the
end of the incubation period, the samples were killed
with 0.5 ml. 40% Formaldehyde per B.O.D. bottle, and fil-
tered on.45u millipore filters. The filters were then
