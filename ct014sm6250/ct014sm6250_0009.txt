planation compatable with the above results, and with re-
sults obtained from other organisms, is that DDT could be
damaging the cell membrane systems. The fact that the rate
of respiration increases as the photosynthetic rate de-
creases, as clearly shown in Figure I and Table I, and
that the ability to photosynthesize of the chlorophyll A
also decreases, (Figure 4), in the cell suggest that the
cell membranes are being affected. If the external membrane
system of the cell is being damaged in any way, respiration
rates may increase to maintain osmotic balance with the
environment. At high concentrations of DDT, cells were found
to plasmolize, further indicating that the ability to
regulate osmotic balance might be damaged. If energy was
being utilized to maintain osmotic balance and/or repair
membranes (as indicated by the increased respiration rate), the
synthesis of chlorophyll A, along with any other energy requirÂ¬
ing process, may be slowed down, as indicated in Figure 5.
Furthermore, the chloroplasts of the cell are also sur-
rounded by a relatively sensitive membrane, and if DDT were
damaging it, the ability to photosynthesize would be les-
soned, as my data indicates in Figure 4. It has been found
also that DDT inhibits Hill reaction activity in barley
chloroplasts (Lawler & Rogers, 1967), and this could happen
in phytoplankton chloroplasts as well.
Another interesting phenomena is that when cells were
exposed to a given concentration of DDT once, and then their
photosynthetic rate measured over a long period of time, they
