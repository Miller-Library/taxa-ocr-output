However, it is still not known by what mechanism DDT in-
fluences photosynthesis. There was some question as to
whether or not the actual photosynthetic process was being
harmed, or if general inhibition of the entire metabolic
system of the organism was occurring. Therefore, the
objectives of this investigation were: a) to evaluate to
what degree various concentrations of DDT would alter
the photosynthetic rate of a natural marine phytoplankton
community, and, b) to attempt to determine the mechanism
by which the photosynthetic process is altered by DDT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
All phytoplankton samples were collected in Monterey
Bay, from a depth of fifteen meters, approximately z mile
off shore to the north of Hopkins Marine Station at buoy
no. 4. Two sampling procedures were used during the
study. The first involved taking whole water samples with
a five liter Van Dorn sampler (Van Dorn, 1956), and im-
mediately transferring the sea water to 300 ml. B.O.D.
bottles with a siphon apparatus. The B.O.D. bottles were
kept cool on ice and protected from direct sunlight by
wrapping them in two layers of tin foil, Bottles were
held under these conditions for an average of 1.5 hours be¬
fore subsequent utilization in various experiments conduc¬
ted ashore at the Hopkins Marine Station. The second
sampling procedure involved 20 minute horizontal tows with
