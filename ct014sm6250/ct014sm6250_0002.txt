INTRODUCTION
As the concentration of DDT and other polychloriÂ¬
nated hydrocarbons increases in the world ecosystem, the
fact that they are biologically harmful to many non-
target organisms is becoming more and more evident. Harm-
ful effects by these pesticides have been observed on
every trophic level, from man, down through the very
smallest phytoplankters.
DDT is a residual organic compound, readily dis-
solvable in lipid substances, and thus, becomes easily
concentrated in the fatty tissues of organisms. As a
result, it has reached lethal proportions at the highest
trophic levels. The pathway of DDT through the food
chain, and its accumulation at the top, is a major con-
tributing factor to its lethality. How DDT enters the
food chain is an important question, and examination of
the lower trophic levels may provide a clue, since the
marine phytoplankton form the base of many oceanic food
chains, and are known to concentrate DDT from the water
at levels equal to and greater than those of the envir-
onment. Not only is DDT concentrated by these organisms,
but it also exerts a harmful effect on their metabolic
systems. And this fact is of great importance in view
of the impact it might have on the entire oceanic food
supply.
Wurster (1968) found that DDT inhibits photosyn-
