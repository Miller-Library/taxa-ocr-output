ABSTRACT
DDT inhibits photosynthesis in natural populations of
marine phytoplankton at levels as low as 10 ppb, and
reduces it to 5% of the normal rate at 1 ppm. The rate
of photosynthesis/unit chlorophyll A decreases with in-
creasing concentration of DDT, with a corresponding inÂ¬
crease in the rate of respiration. In exponentially
growing cultures, the rate of chlorophyll A synthesis
decreases with increasing concentration of DDT. DDE,
the most common analog of DDT in the environment, in-
hibits photosynthesis at much lower concentrations, and
to a greater extent,,than DDT.
