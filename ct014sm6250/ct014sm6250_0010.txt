regained the ability to photosynthesize normally after ap-
proximately 20 hours. Possibly DDT could be blocking or
clogging the cell membranes, but not permanently damaging
them, or possibly the cell is able to effectively repair the
DDT damaged membranes at the expense of stored food reserves.
The fact that DDE has a greater inhibitory ability
than DDT is very significant. It has been demonstrated that
DDT is reduced to DDE by ultra-violet rays. Therefore, due
to sunlight alone, most of the DDT residues in the environ-
ment may be in the form of DDE. The fact that DDE is a more
potent substance could have dangerous biological reperÂ¬
cussions in the environment.
CONCLUSION
DDT does affect the photosynthetic process of marine
phytoplankton, but the actual mechanism by which damage is
incurred remains unknown. It is known that respiration
increases, the synthesis of chlorophyll A decreases, and at
high concentrations of DDT, cells plasmolize. Further studies
on this subject are needed. Possible approaches to the
problem might involve using metabolic poisons with known
inhibition abilities, and comparing results of these to
those gained from DDT. Investigation of the phytoplankton
ability to regain photosynthetic prowess could reveal pos-
sible inhibition mechanisms. Long term respiration studies
might also shed some light on the subject.
The fact remains though, that much work is needed. The
