folded, placed in scintillation viles, covered with Tol-
uene scintillation fluid, and counted on the scintillation
counter. All'controls were run with 95% ethanol, as the
DDT was suspended in that.
Cell density measurements were made with the Sedgwick-
rafter cell and a hemocytometer concurrently. Cells making
up long chains were counted individually. Six fields were
counted and then averaged.
Chlorophyll A concentrations were determined by a
fluorescence technique (Holm-Hansen et al, 1968) on 25 ml.
samples of phytoplankton filtered on.45u millipore filters.
The chlorophyll was extracted with 90% acetone, and diluted
36,000x before readings were made on the Florometer. If
readings could not be taken immediately, the filters were
wrapped in tin foil and frozen until extraction with acetone
could be done.
RESULTS
Experiment 1.
Experiment 1 was designed to broadly establish a photo-
synthetic inhibition curve of marine phytoplankton by DDT.
Whole water samples were collected in the manner described above
and incubated in DDT concentrations of 1, 3, 30, 300, and
1000 ppb. The results are shown in Table I, and the inhibi-
tion curve, as well as the respiration rates are shown on
Figure 1.
