difference in susceptibility of amylose and amylopectin to
hydrolysis by the amylase in the hepatopancreaslis presented
in Fig. 1.
DISCUSSION
Although the hepatopancreas is by far the strongest
producer of amylase, the foregut, containing the esophagus
and stomach, does show an activity twice as great as that of
the muscle, which probably owes its activity to the presence
of amylase in the blood and hemolymph. Amylase in the blood
and hemolymph of another decapod, Astacus, was demonstrated
by Damboviceanu(8). The hind and midguts also showed activity
corresponding to this base level. The even lower activity
of the diverticula may be due to that organ's small size and
smooth surface which allow a more efficient washing as compared
to the other bulkier, more irregular organs tested, which
probably keep a larger portion of their original fluids.
In the determination of the pH optimum, the use of tris-
maleate buffer in place of citrate-phosphate buffer showed
no significant difference in amylase activity.
The finding, in the final hydrdysis products, of glucose
and very little maltose corresponds with the findings of
Hourani (9) of maltse activity in the hepatopancresa and weak
maltase activity in the foregut.
