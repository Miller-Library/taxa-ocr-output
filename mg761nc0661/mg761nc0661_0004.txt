of enzmye concentrations in tissues is in mg of extrafcted
tissue required to hydrolyze 1 mg of starch in 30 minutes.
All tests were run in duplicate with starch solutions buffered
at pH 5.4 (acetate) and pH 7.4 (tris-maleate).
RESULTS
The results of the investigation on the sources of
amylase are presented in Table 1. By far the most important
organ in the secretion of amylase appears to be the hepato-
pancreas. It has over twenty time the activity of the stomach
and forty times the activity of the hind and midguts.
The optimum pH for the amylase present in the hepato-
pancreas was determined in citrate-phosphate buffers varying
by 0.4 of a pH unit over the range from 5.8 to 7.8. One
ml of 11% starch was incubated for 30 minutes with varying amounts
enzyme extract at each pH. and the end-points determined as
before. The results of this test are presented in Table 2.
The optimum temperature for the amylase present in the
hepatopancreas was determined by the same method. Here, the reaction
mixtures were buffered at the optimum pH (7.0)and were incubated
at five temperatures from 10° to 40°0. Since reaction mixtures
at each temperature showed the same end-point, colorimeter readings
were taken on those reaction mixtures which still showed
blue staining. From these readings, the reaction rates appeared
to increase with increasing temperture up to 35°, decreasing
thereafter.
