The final hydrolysis prooducts were determined by in-
cubating 2ml of 1% starch with.lg of enzyme extract at 1506
for 10 hours. Analysis was made by paper chromatography after
the method of Jeanes(5) using a pyridine, butanol, water
solvent in the ratio of 3:2:1.5 over a period of 20 hours.
The developing spray reagent was that quoted by Gordon (6)
as CD-1. Two test spots were made in addition to one control
spot each of maltose, glucose, and a mixture of maltose and
glucose. While the control spots showed good separation of
maltose and glucose, the test spots showed a high content of
glucose and only the faintest trace of maltose. This result
would strongly indicate the presence of a maltase powerful
enough to break down the maltose as fast as it is produced
by the amylase.
An investigation of the presence of a ß-amylase was made
using .1% concentrations of amylose (Nutritional Biochemical
Corp.) and amylopection (Calbiochem). Two samples of enzyme
extract from the same source were used, one sample being
heated at 57° for 20 minutes. Four ma of each enzyme
preparation (heated and unheated) was incubated at room
temperature with 2 ml of each substrate (amylose and amylo-
pectin). The mixtures were buffered at pH 6.8. One-tenth
ml aliquots were taken at 20-minute intervals and tested accord-
ing to the Somogyi(7) method for the production of reducing
sugars, and a rate of sugar production was determined. The
