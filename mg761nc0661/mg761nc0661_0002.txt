An examination of the gut contents and feeding habits
of Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857) revealed that their
diet contains a wide variety of animal and plant matter,
no doubt containing a significant amount of starch and
possibly glycogen. A preliminary iodine test on starch
substrate incubated with hepatopancreas extract showed that
this organ does, indeed, contain a powerful amylase. An
investigation of the literature revealed that very little
work has been done on the origin of carbohydrases in decapods.
Wolvekampo)found glands in the wall of the gut which he be-
lieved to produce mucus and "perhaps amylase." Waterman (2)
concludes that the secretion of digestive enzymes takes
place "almost exclusively in the hepatopancreas." The pur-
pose of this investigation was to locate the origin of amylase
in the digestive tract, at the same time providing an indica-
tion of possible sites of origin of other carbohydrases for
another investigation being done at the same time. In addition,
the properties of the amylase present in the hepatopancreas
were investigated.
