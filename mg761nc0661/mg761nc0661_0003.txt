MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crabs were taken from the intertidal zones of China
Point, the site of Hopkins Marine Station, and Point Pinos
at Pacific Grove. They were kept in aquaria with fresh sea-
water until needed.
For the purpose of this investigation, the digestive
tract was divided into five segments: foregut, extending
from mouth to juncture of anterior midgut diverticula: midgut,
from anterior midgut diverticula to posterior midgut diver-
ticulum; hindgut, from posterior midgut diverticulum through
the anus; hepatopancreas; and, anterior midgut diverticula.
Before testing, the gut segments were split and thouroughly
washed in distilled water to eliminate the amylase activity
of the particulate contents as well as the amylase secreted
elsewhere and transported to that portion of the gut. The
tissues were then ground in an homogenizing tube and assayed
immediately.
The method of assay, also described by waksman(3),
basically that of Wohlgemuth. One ml of.1% soluble starch
(Baker and Adamson) was incubated with different dilutions
of enzyme extracts for thirty minutes at room temperature
(21922°0.). Two drops of iodine solution (Io.2%; KI.4%)
and 3ml of Hø0 were added. The reaction mixture containing
the lowest enzyme concentration that gave no blue color with
iodine was taken as the end-point of the assay. The expression
