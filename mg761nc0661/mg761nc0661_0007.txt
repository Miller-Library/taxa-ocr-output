While £-amylase is generally considered to be solely
a plant enzyme, evidence for its presence in other decapods
is given by Yonge(10). The sensitivity of O-amylase and the
resistence of Ø-amykse to heating is discussed by Waksman(11).
The differences in activity of heated and unheated preparations
of hepatopancreas extract, and the differences in susceptibility
of amylose and amylopectin to hydrolysis suggest the possible
presence of a ß-amylase in this organ of P. smmuelis.
SUMMARY
The hepatopancreas was found to be the most important
producer of amylase in Pagurus samuelis.
2. The foregut, though much weaker, was also shown to have
significant amylase activity.
3.
The other portions of the digestive system had activities
equal to or lower than muscle tissue. This activity is
probably the result of amylase in the hemolymph and blood.
4. Under laboratory conditions, the pH optimum was found to
be 7.0.
5. Under the same conditions, the temperature optimum was found
to be near 35°0.
Some evidence for the possible presence of aß-amylase
was found.
