food energy into spawn production. Eggs at the time of release
accounted for 30% of the wet weight of a 0.78 gram specimen, and
18% of a 1.0 gram specimen. If the data in Figure l is to be
considered in terms of DDT residue concentration vs. age, the
weight scale would then be compressed at the lower end, resulting
in somewhat straighter curves.
Uptake of DDT From Seawater
Measurement of surface uptake of DDT from water was accomplished
using ring-labelled C+ DDT as a tracer. Hermissenda were held
in closed one-gallon glass jars with 3 liters of unfiltered
seawater containing the CDDT. The jars were kept in dim light
at a constant 15° C. Before the addition of the animal, the
jars were allowed to stand for 24 hours in order to allow the
DDT to adsorb to equilibrium with the glass surface. To maintain
a fairly constant concentration of DDT in the water and prevent
stagnation, the water was changed daily. With animals present,
the decrease of CDDT concentration over 24 hours ranged from
20% for an initial 30 PPT (parts per trillion) to 50% for an initial
5 PPT. Consequently, in order to obtain average concentrations
of 5. 10. 20, and 30 PPT, the initial concentrations were prepared
at 7. 12, 23, and 33 PPT. Each day, before being moved to
fresh water, the Hermissenda were allowed to feed on Obelia.
Uptake with time was measured by periodic sampling of a few of
the animals cerata, dorsal extensions of the body wall containing
diverticula of the digestive gland. Comprising on the average
36% of the body dry weight, the cerata contain 95% of the animals'
total DDTüresidues. Cerata samples were digested in tha acid
mixture and extracted with hexane. Sample activities were counted
