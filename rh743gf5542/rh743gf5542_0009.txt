of the cerata. It may also be noted that large decrease in
concentration coincided with the release of the second batch
of eggs, though the absolute amount of C+ DDT represented by
the drop was not reflected in either the amount recovered from
the eggs or from other losses.
1 recovered from the flasks presumably included all DDT
contained in the water, feces, mucustrails, and adsorbed to
the glass. Results are shown in Figure 7 in terms of the rate
of loss from the animals. No correlation between rate of loss
and concentration in cerata was found.
The DDT contained in the eggs accounted for 28% of the
total taken up and 73% of the total lost (Figure 8). The small
amount of DDT in the second eggs indicates that though the eggs
accumulate a sizable portion of the DDT as it is taken up, they
cannot accumulate much of the DDT already stored elsewhere in
the animal.
DDT Residue Flow in Hermissenda
Under Natural Conditions
The major problem in describing the situation in the field
is in predicting the actual input dosages. Data presented here
has indicated that long-term uptake of DDT residues from water
may be very slight or very great, depending on the ambient
concentration. Estimates of DDT residue levels in inshore
waters of the Pacific coast are in the range of a few parts per
trillion.9) The harbor of Monterey acts as a catch-basin for
the southern end of Monterey Bay, and would be expected to have
higher than average levels of pesticide contaminants.
