An estimate of between 5 and 15 PPT seems reasonable, and it
would thus be likely that surface uptake in Hermissenda is
either in equilibrium or accounts for a very slow accumulation.
The question of effective food input dosage is complex and
unclear. Hermissenda is a rapidly growing organism, with the
amount of food being utilized for new tissue prodction probably
far greater than that required for metabolic maintenance. If the
rate of tissue production- including DDT accumulation sites-
were to remain constant as were the feeding rate, then a constant
residue concentration might be maintained. However, in three
Opisthobranchs whose nutrition has been studied, the efficiency
of conversion of food into new tissue and spawn decreases with
age. Since the efficiency of removal of DDT residues from food
would seem independent of the efficiency of food utilization,
this suggests an increasing dosage from food in relation to
the production of new storage sites. Thus a higher concentration
of residues in older animals might reflect an equilibrium between
tissue content and increasing dosage, as well as a continual
accumulation from a constant dosage. Two other factors are
probably operating to confuse the issue: First, once Hermissenda
reach sexual maturity, a portion of the DDT residue input is
accumulated and eliminated in the spawn, thus periodically
reducing the dosage to the rest of the body. Secondly, the
dosage may vary as a result of a possible change in feeding
habits eith age. Smaller Hermissenda were almost always found
on a hydroid-bryozoan substrate, while larger ones were observed
as often on colonies of Amaroucium. The largest specimens were
consistently found on the muddy bottom among the fallout around
the bases of the pilings.
