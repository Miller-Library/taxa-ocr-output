and the total recovered from the eggs was 285 picograms,
meaning that during the first week 49% of the DDT retained in
the animal accumulated in the eggs, and that once eliminated
as an accumulations site, nearly all the DDT taken in was then
accumulated in the cerata.
The important role of egg production in DDT residue flow
also became evident in a comparison of the pathways for DDT loss.
Losses of DDT Following Surface Uptake
Four Hermissenda of nearly equal size were held in seawater
containing 40 PPT C
DDT for a period of 48 hours. Each was then
placed in a stoppered 2 liter flask containing DDT-free water.
At one to two day intervals the animals were removed, sampled for
concentration in the cerata, and returned to a fresh flask of
water. DDT lost from the animal was recovered by shaking the
entire contents of the flask with three washes of petroleum
ether. On the first day feces were collected and analyzed
separately and found to account for a mean of 8% of the Câ€œ DDT
recovered from the flasks. Feces collection was difficult due
to rapid disintegration, and thereafter feces were extracted
along with the rest of the flask contents. Large egg masses
were deposited by all four animal during the first day. Smaller
batches were released 12 to 14 days later.
The concentration of CDDT in the cerata over the two weeks
of the experiment is shown in Figure 6. There is no clear
explanation for the fluctuation excpt to note that changes
in the concentration might be due either to transfer of DDT
between the cerata and the body, or to changes in the wet weight
