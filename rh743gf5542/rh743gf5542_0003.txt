class were digested over steam by a l:l mixture of glacial acetic
and perchloric acid, and the non-polar fraction extracted with

Glassware for GLC analysis was combusted overnight at 400 C to
remove any DDT contamination.
The results, presented in Figure 1, show a definite increase
in the total-body DDT residue concentration with increasing size.
Since several specimens in the higher weight class samples
contained spawn, possible accounting for the higher concentration,
egg masses were collected and analyzed. Measured levels were too
low for accurate quantification- less than 2 PPB (parts per billion).
Another possibility for the higher concentration in larger animals
would be a larger percentage content of lipid. To check this,
Hermissenda of a full size range were weighed, dried and re-weighed,
digested in the acid mixture, and extracted with ethanol and
petroleum ether. The extracts were evaporated until no ether odor
was detectable, and the residue weighed. The results (Eig. 2) show a
constant percentage of ether-extractable lipids independent of
size. This does not entirely rule out the possibility of a
relatively higher number of DDT residue accumulation sites in
the larger animals, since DDT residue storage might depend on
the character and distribution of lipids as well as amount.
Though size increases with age, the relation is unlikely
to be linear. The growth curve in Hermissenda probably begins
to flatten out around 0.8 grams weight as they begin to divert
