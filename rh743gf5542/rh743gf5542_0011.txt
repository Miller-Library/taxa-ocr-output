Summary
Results show an equilibrium for surface uptake, estab-
lishing a constant DDT concentration in the cerata with a
5 to 10 PPT concentration in the water, a level likely to
be present in the habitat. A two compartment model is pro-
posed for the uptake mechanism. Spawning is shown to be the
primary pathway for DDT output, eliminating as much as 50%
of the residues taken up during each 10 to 20 day egg pro-
duction period, but not eliminating DDT residues already
stored in the cerata. Field levels show an increasing whole-
body concentration with increasing age, probably dependent on
feeding dosage, but difficult to determine without additional
autecological knowledge of Hermissenda.
