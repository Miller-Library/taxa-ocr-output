pilings became abundant in the early summer, a number of samples
were collected consisting of only the younger portion of the
stolons, selectively grazed by Hermissenda. Very low levels
of DDT residues were found, again precluding accurate quantiÂ¬
fication, but appearing to be less than 1 PPB wet weight.
To determine the general distribution of ingested DDT,
14 small Hermissenda were fed the chopped-up bodies of Hermissenda
labelled with CDDT. The animals were placed in a flask of
DDT-free seawater for 48 hours and then dissected into pooled
samples of cerata, total viscera, and remainder of the body-
consisting of the muscular foot and head. Of the C recovered
from the bodies, 83.7% was in the cerata, 8.7% in the viscera,
and 5.6% in the remainder. Feces were also collected from the
flask and accounted for 3.9% of the total label recovered.
Analysis of the water in the flask during the 48 hours showed
no measurable increase, although a significant total amount in
the two liters could have been undetected in the 8 ml aliquots
sampled. Possible adsorption to the glass surface was not
measured. Thus the value of 96% for the efficiency of retention
of DDT from food is probably high.
Being rather small, few of these specimens contained spawn.
In order to check for accumulation in eggs and the accumulation
in the cerata with time, a single 0.8 gram Hermissenda was
allowed to feed continuously on Obelia labelled to a concentration
of 7 PPB CDDT. Eggs were released during the 9th and 10th
days, coinciding with a marked increase in the cerata concentration
(Figure 9). At the time of the third sampling, the total amount
of CDDT in the Hermissenda was calculated as 300 picograms, a
