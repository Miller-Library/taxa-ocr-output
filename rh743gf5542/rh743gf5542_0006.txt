cerata, independent of the total amount present. Again, this
might be explained by an "equilibrium compartment" and a
"storage compartment" An earlier experiment in which the
concentration of DDT in the water was continuously measured
may also support this theory. As shown in Figure 5, as the
DDT concentration in the water drops below 10 PPT, the curve
for Hermissenda uptake (the entire animal in this case) begins
to follow fluctuations in the water concentration curve, even
DDT from the animal when the concentration
showing a loss of the
drops below 5 PPT. There is also basis for this theory in the
strucure of the cerata themselves, since they consist of an
outer layer of body wall tissue and a core of digestive gland
tissue- with not neccessarily the same DDT affinities.
DDT Uptake Through Feeding
Hermissenda crassicornis is reported as primarily a non-
specific hydroid feeder.0
Animals in this study accepted a
variety of genera including Obelia, Aglaophenia, Sertularia,
Eucopella, and Syncoryne. The hydroid appearing to be the
primary food source on the wharf pilings was Obelia dichotoma.
However, they were also observed to feed occasionally on the
bryozoan Bowerbankia, on a small species of Dendronotus abundant
on the Obelia, and readily on dead or disabled fellow Hermissenda.
Original measurement of DDT residues in Obelia gave a value
of approximately 15 PPB wet weight. However, these samples were
collected from the sides of floating piers, presumably being
exposed to higher levels of contaminants from surface fallout,
and also consisted of entire stolons with some inseparable non-
hydroid material. When the hydroid population on the submerged
