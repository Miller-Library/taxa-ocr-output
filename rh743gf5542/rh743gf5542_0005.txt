Curves of the accumulation of CDDT in the cerata for the
four water concentrations are shown in Figure 3. Points represent
data from several runs, and concentrations are based primarily
on wet weights, with dry weight concentrations set to the same
scale by a wet/dry conversion factor of 12.15. While the
uptake curves level off after 2-3 days for animals in water of
5 and 10 PPT CDDT, the curves for the higher concentrations
do not level off at the same time or at proportionate values.
Two possibilities accounting for this are: (i) an equilibrium
between the total DDT concentration in the cerata and the con-
centration in the water, with an increasin equilibrium constant
for higher water concentrations, and (ii) an uptake pathway
consisting of two consecutive steps or compartments, with the
first compartment establishing an equilibrium DDT concentration
when the concentration in the water is around 5-10 PPT. With
some sort of limit on the DDT capacity of the first compartment,
higher concentrations in the water result in an overflow into
the second compartment where the DDT is continuously accumulated.
An additional experiment lends support to the latter possibility:
Two Hermissenda were first exposed to water with 30 and 60 PPT
of unlabelled DDT for 60 hours, and then placed in water containing
5 and 10 PPT respectively of CDDT. The uptake curves of the
labelled DDT (Figure 4) are very similar to those in the previous
experiment, despite the initial period of uptake from a six times
higher concentration in the water. This suggests that the cerata
uptake curves resulting from DDT water concentrations of 5 and 10
PPT represent a turnover of a certain portion of the DDT in the
