The accumulation of DDT residues 'in higher trophic levels
by magnification through the food chain is now well documented.
However, the mechanisms for accumulation at the species level are
not fully understood. There is presently no full account of the
kinetics of DDT residues in a marine invertebrate. This report
describes some aspects of DDT flow in the nudibranch Hermissenda
crassicornis (Escholtz). A preliminary investigation indicated
that a Hermissenda of any age will have been exposed to more
DDT residues, available through feeding and surface uptake, than
is reflected in the total body burden. This suggests a considerable
turnover of the pesticide, either by a high rate of loss or by
a physical equlibrium between tissue concentration and input dosage.

problem presented is one of establishing the pathways for DDi
residue flow and their relative contributions in determining the
amount of DDT residues in the animal. This problem is approached
with a) the determination of field levels and the relation of
DDT residue concentration to age, b) measurement of uptake by
surface adsorption and feeding, c) measurement of losses of DDT
residues, and d) an attempt to relate this information to what
may be happening under natural conditions.
DDT Residue Levels in Hermissenda
Hermissenda for this study were collected subtidally from
the pilings of Wharf No. 2 in the harbor of Monterey, California
during the spring and summer. To determine the DDT residue levels
in various sized specimens, a number of the animals were divided
