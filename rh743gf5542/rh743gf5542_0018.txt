Increases in the concentration of CDDT
with time in the cerata of Hermissenda during uptake
from seawater containing 5, 10, 20, and 30 parts per
trillion of the CDDT. Data is from several runs
under the same conditions, with animals of the same
approximate size. Concentrations are based on both
wet and dry weights.
