a range from O to 1.015 10P N/m. One atmosphere of pressure is
equal to 1N/m.
Tracings from the video tape of the shape change the sucker
undergoes when stimulated by an electrode (figure 2). Shape (a) is
the relaxed form, "hinges" on which it can collapse are evident.
In the contracted form (d), the "hinges" are almost gone and the
acetabulum is approximately spherical.
The relative change in volume was plotted verses increasing
pressure for all the models (figure 3).The sphere and the
hemisphere are are the most resistant to pressure, at one
atmosphere, retaining 607 of their original volume. The model of
the contracted acetabulum with the "fixed" nodes was the next
most resistant structure, deforming only 50 at one atmosphere.
The quarter of the sphere retained only 157 of its original
volume at one atmosphere. The relaxed acetabulum and the
contracted acetabulum with the bottom nodes free to move on thex
axis collapsed totally before a 20"' of an atmosphere had been
applied.
he shapes of the pressurized models are shown in figures 4

Discussion
The abject of this study was to ascertain how suckers can
resist the atmosphere of pressure that had been exhibited in the
tenacity tests. The octopus sucker undergoes a shape change when
it contracts. The contracted shape is very resistant to pressure,
because like an arch, it is very resistant to compression forces.
This is important to the octopus because the sucker, when
