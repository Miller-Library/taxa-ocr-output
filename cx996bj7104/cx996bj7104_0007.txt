Ocknowledoments
I would like to thank Mark Denny for his constant support
and adyice, without which this project would not have gotten oft
the ground and through to completion; and for constantly helping
and explaining to me what exactly biomechanics is. I also like to
thank Chris Fatton for his help with the histology. My special
thanks my fellow students in BIO 175H and to Mark, Stuart, Chuck,
and Gilly, who made this quarter the most enjoyable one of my
years at Stanford.
