Introduction
Suckers are found in all cephalopods except nautilus. (Dilly
and Nixon, 1977) Suckers are a very powerful and sensitive organ. For
example, suckers may be torn from the living animal before
detaching from the substratum (Lane, 1957). A more comprehensive
study found that Octopus vulgaris can exert a "holding tension'
of up to 100 times its body weight ( Trueman and Packard, 1968).
Many studies have examined the morphology of suckers (plate 1)
and the different mechano- and chemoreceptors in the infundibulum
(Dilly and Nixon, 1977, Wells, 196Ja), but no work has been done
on the actual mechanics of how the sucker adheres.
It is generally assumed that suckers adhere by the use of a
preszure difference adhesive (i.e. suction). For example,
consider Figure 1. When no force is exerted by the spring (a),
there is no pressure difference between the inside of the
cylinder and the outside and no force holds the cylinder to the
surface. When the spring contracts (b), the pressure decreases
inside the cylinder. This pressure difference between the inside
and out result in a force that pushes the cylinder down on the
surface. The seal between the cylinder and the surface is
important because any leaks would negate the the pressure
difference.
Materials and Hethods
Experiments were conducted on a 90g OOctopus rubescens at
Hopkins Marine Station, Facific Grove, CA.

could resist were made as follows: a small,roughened circle of
