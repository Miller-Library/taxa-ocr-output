program was used to examine the deformation of suckers in the
plane strain only. The sucker is circularly symmetrical, thus a
planar section as an appropriate, simple model for the strain in
the entire structure. The computer model dealt with the
acetabulum of the relaxed and contracted suckers because it is
the part of the sucker that is creating the pressure difference.
The infundibulum is not directly involved in creating the
pressure because it flattens out against the surface to which the
sucher is holding and creates the seal. Also, analogs structures
were also made for comparison resisting pressure.
Iwo models of the acetabulum were tested; one in which the
nodes at the opening of the acetabulum were fixed and another in
which they were free to slide on the substrate. The contracted
acetabulum with the fixed nodes is more representative of the
actual sucker because the infundibulum is pressed against the
surface and would not slide very easily.
Oll models were built of quadrilateral plates with the
stiffness of contracted muscle(1 N/m, Schmidt-Nielson, 1979).
except for the relaxed acetabulum model which had halt that
stiffness. A force of up to an atmosphere was applied to the
models by assigning a pressure of zero inside the model and
increasing pressure outside. The volume at a given pressure
divided by the original volume (no pressure) was plotted to
determine thestiffness of the structures.

The average tenacity of the suckers was J.95 10' N/m" with
