contracted, must resist the pressure difference required tor
adhesion. However, when the octopus wants to let go, it can do so
easily by relaxing the muscles of the sucker. Not only does the
material become less stiff, but the sucker acetabulum can
collapse very easily around the "hinges". This relaxed state is
not at all resistant to pressure, so that the sucker can not hold
any negative pressure and the sucker releases easily.
The values used here for material properties (stiffness) of
the contracted muscle may be low, especially if the muscles are
reinforced with collagen. However, it will be difficult to
measure the stress and strain curve for the acetabulum muscle
because f the small size.
Most of the octopus suckers studied to date are very
similar to those of a rubescens. The suckers of the squid and
cuttlefish do not have infundibula proportionally as large as the
actopodia suckers, but the acetabulum muscles are the same sise
or larger and have the "hinges", so it would be reasonable to
assume that they work the same way.
