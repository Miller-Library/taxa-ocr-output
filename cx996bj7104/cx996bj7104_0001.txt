Abstract
The functional morphology of the suckers of Octopus
rubescens were studied by computer models of the acetabulum. The
suckers undergo a shape change when contracting, forming a shape
that is yery resistant to pressure and therefore adaptive tor
adhesion. However, when the octopus wants to let go, it relakes
the muscles of the sucker and the acetabulum collapses around
"hinges" to a shape that is not at all resistant to pressure,
allowing the sucker to release.
