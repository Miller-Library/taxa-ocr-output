plexiglas attached by a string to a spring scale was placed on
submerged suckers of a live octopus and the diameter of the
suckers on the plexiglas was measured with calipers. Ihe octopus
was narcotized in a 17 solution of ethanol because an animal that
is not narcotized will not hold onto the plexiglas. The arm of
the octopus was restrained while the spring scale was slowly
pulled away. The maximum force before the sucker released was
recorded, and the force per sucker surface area (infundibulum) was
calculated. In many cases it was probable that the octopus
released of its own volition rather than the force exceeding the
sucker's hold.
Histology: A small segment of an arm was excised and put
either directly into a fixing solution (507 sea water, 507 a
misture of 27 formalin and 2 gluteraldhehyde) or into a relaking
solution of isotonic magnesium chloride, and then into the fixing
solution. Ofter fixing, the segments were dehydrated in ethanol
and left overnight in an infiltrating solution of JB-4. Segments
were then embedded in JE-4 in a vacuum for two hours, sectioned
(6 microns) with a glass knife, and stained with methylene blue
and chromtrope 2H.
Ig record the shape change of a sucker as it is
contracting, an excised sucker was cut through its center in a
sagittal cut. It was stimulated with an electrode and the
contractions were video taped through a dissecting microscope.
Iracings of the contracted and relaxed acetabulum were
made from histological sections and were incorporated into a
finite element analysis of structural stiffness. The MacNealÂ¬
