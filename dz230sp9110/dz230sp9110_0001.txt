Abstract:
The intertidal red alga Mastocarpus papillatus was sampled for genetic diversity
in three populations from central and southern California. M. papillatus can exhibit an
asexual apomictic life history, with female gametes giving rise to female gametophytes.
A higher proportion of this asexual reproduction occurs in populations in central
California and further north (Zupan and West, 1988). It is therefore hypothesized that
this geographic variation in life history should affect the population structure of M.
papillatus.
DNA was extracted from haploid female gametophytes and then fingerprinted
using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique (Vos et al. 1995).
A bootstrapped consensus tree was constructed using parsimony. Localities were shown
to have distinct population fingerprints. Greater population structure was found in the
northern, more asexually reproducing populations, but this was most likely due to
sampling methods. No definite link was found between the life history and population
genetics.
Introduction:
Background
Mastocarpus papillatus is one of the most common red algae on the California
coast (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976). It occurs in the mid to high intertidal and is often
dried completely during low tides. Classified in the family Petrocelidaceae, Mastocarpus
follows a typical red algal life history with a tetrasporophyte, gametophytes, and a
parasitic carposporophyte (figure 1).
Mastocarpus grows in a crustose form as a tetrasporophyte and in a foliose form
as a gametophyte. Male and female gametophytes are morphologically similar with
males lacking the papillae, which house the developing carposporophyte, and usually
showing less dichotymous branching than the females. In addition to the sexual cycle,
females can asexually reproduce in an apomictic cycle whereby unfertilized female
gametes mature in the papillae like carpospores but grow directly into female
gametophytes on release from the papillae.
