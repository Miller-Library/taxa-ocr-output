Figure 1: Life history of Mastocarpus papillatus. The sexual cycle proceeds from
the tetrasporophyte (2n). Meiotically produced tetraspores grow into male and female
gametophytes (n). The gametophytes mitotically produce gametes. The female gametes
are retained in the papillae. Male gametes are dispersed by wave action. Fertilization
occurs in the papillae on the surface of the female blade. The fertilization event produces
a carposporophyte (2n) which is parasitic on the female blade. The carposporophyte
mitotically produces carpospores which grow into tetrasporophytes on release.
The asexual cycle proceeds from the female gametophyte. Female gametes which
go unfertilized begin growing in the papillae in the manner of a carposporophyte. Spores
that are produced grow directly into female gametophytes. This is known as apogamy.

Figure 5: Gel showing the banding patterns characteristic of the three sites. The 10
lanes on the left are Santa Barbara samples. The middle 10 lanes are Santa Cruz samples.
The remaining lanes on the right side are Hopkins samples. Bands that were scored are
indicated. Not all samples that were scored for the phenogram appear on this gel. Some
of the Hopkins lanes were not scored for the phenogram. Indicated sample numbers do
not correspond to those shown on the phenogram. A different autoradiogram was used
for scoring bands.
