Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)
The AFLP procedure by Vos et al. (1995) with modifications by DeTomaso et al.
(1998) requires the following steps: cut with restriction enzymes and ligate
oligonucleotide adapters, pre-AFLP PCR reaction, and AFLP reaction with radioactive
P-labeled primer (figure 4, from Tim Schaeffer)
Approximately 100ng of DNA per sample was used in each cut and ligation. The
cut reaction was carried out using 5 units each of Msel and EcoRl, from New England
Biolabs (NE), in a 30uL reaction with NE Buffer 2 for 1.5 hours at 37°C. The
oligonucleotide adapters were ligated on to the DNA fragments using 15 units of T4
ligase (NE) in a 40uL reaction for 10 hours at 37°C. Each cut and ligation was diluted up
to 100uL with TE (.1). 4uL of this solution was used in each 20uL pre-AFLP PCR
reaction (preamp).
Tnoticed in testing for the cutting ability of EcoRl and Msel on the purified DNA.
that EcoRl did a very poor job of cutting the DNA. While DNA cut with Msel appeared
as a smear on a 1 percent agarose gel with ethidium bromide, EcoRI cut DNA appeared
as the same sharp band that was originally produced by purification. Some EcoRI cutting
must have occurred for the AFLP to work. It is possible that there are methylated areas
on the DNA which block EcoRl cutting.
For the preamp, 30ng EcoRl (A selective) primer and 30ng Msel (T selective)
primer were used with 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PERKIN-ELMER). The pre¬
AFLP PCR was run in a PERKIN-ELMER model TCI thermocycler. A 72°C start for 2
minutes followed by 20 cycles of 94°C for 45s, 56°C for 45s, 72°C for 1min was carried
out. The completed reaction was diluted 1:20 with TE (.1).
3uL of the preamp DNA was used in a lOuL reaction for the AFLP PCR. The
AFLP PCR was carried out using a radioactive 32P-labeled EcoRl (ACT selective) primer
and a non-labeled Msel (TC selective) primer. The thermocycling was done in a Techne
GENIUS PCR machine with heated lid.
The AFLP PCR thermocycles were as follows: 95°C hot start, 2min; 94°C
denaturation, 45s; 65°C primer annealing, 45s; 72°C polymerization, Imin; the next 9
