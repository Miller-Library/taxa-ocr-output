cycles were run as a step down function, decreasing the primer annealing temperature by
1.0°C each time until the primer annealing temperature was 56°C; at this step, the
program switched to a repetitive thermocycle of 94°C for 45s, 56°C for 45s, and 72°C for
1 min for 27 cycles.
The completed reaction was diluted with 2X loading dye to stop the reaction.
Samples were kept on ice over this period, then heated to 95°C for 4 minutes and put back
on ice. 4uL of each sample was then loaded in a 19 percent denaturing acrylamide gel
(38 x 50cm dimensions) with 42 percent urea and run for 2 hours and 40 minutes at a
constant 70W. The gel was then transferred to paper and dried for 1.5 hours with vacuum
and heat.
KÖDAK X-Omat film was then exposed on the gel for 12-24 hours and
developed in an automated developer.
Scoring and Analysis
19 bands were scored by eye for presence/absence of radioactive 33P-labeled PCR
fragments over the 30 total samples. Because the female gametophytes are haploid,
scoring a lane for presence/absence of bands gives a haplotype (Glenns, 1999). The
collected data was inputted as a matrix into a PAUP* program. A heuristic test for
parsimony was run 100 times. A strict consensus was taken from the 5 trees yielded. This
strict consensus tree was bootstrapped 500 times to yield the presented tree.
Results:
Figure 5 shows a section from the gel that was scored for the phenogram. Figure
6 shows the bootstrapped unrooted phenogram generated by PAUP*. All populations
cluster by locality as would be expected. Fingerprints from the Santa Barbara population
were noticeably different from Hopkins and Santa Cruz, and this showed up in the
phenogram.
Little population structure is seen within the Santa Barbara clade with only a 61
percent bootstrap value separating the two clades within the Santa Barbara population.
More structure is seen within the Santa Cruz and Hopkins clades. Note the bottom three
