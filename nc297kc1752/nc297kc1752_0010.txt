in branches below some infected pits is reminiscent of
vascular plants in which the primary bud is removed.
Such growth resulted in most of the 2*A pits. The
original 2* apical pit was replaced by the apical
pit of a proliferous branch. In support of this
explanation, the X length of Erythrocystis in the
2* pits was significantly greater than that of the
2*A pits.
More work is needed on the factors which select
for complete development of only one or two Erythrocystis
plants, of one type, within a pit. A form of intraÂ¬
specific competition is suggested. Just as pollen
grains "race" to extend their pollen tubes to the
ovule, Erythrocystis germlings may compete in getting
their rhizoids through the pit space, and into the
medulla. It would be worthwhile to carefully examine
the region of rhizoidal penetration through the
Laurencia cortical layer. It may be that only one
rhizoid gets through.
Among the parasitic red algae, Erythrocystis
holds a rather unique place. Unlike many other red
algal parasites, Erythrocystis has a distinct, uniform
plant body in which all reproductive stages are known.
It has a well-developed cortex and subcortical layer
of cells distinct from the host. Many other parasites
are irregular cushions containing a mixture of host and
parasite cells (eg. Harveyella mirabilis, Janczewskia sp.).
