Tetraspores stuck to trichoblasts with some selectivity
to Laurencia from Stillwater Cove and Hopkins Marine
Station. Their attachment ranged from a weak bond
that could be broken by agitating the cutting to
fairly strong adhesion that was only broken by physically
pulling off the spore. Spores stuck anywhere along the
length of the trichoblasts. Approximately 30% of the
spores landed near the pit and germinated a rhizoid
into the pit. The majority of the spores were lost in
the aquarium. The cuttings in the dry petri dishes
appeared to have the same infection rate as the wet
dishes.
Spores did not show creeping activity. After
24 hours in culture, the Laurencia showed signs of
trichoblast deterioration. The spores attached distally
were cast off with the trichoblast. Trichoblast
deterioration occurred in control dishes without
spores, too.
Sampling confirmed that Erythrocystis thalli
greater than 1 mm in length were found primarily in
the apical pits. Further, a test for the analysis
stis
of variance showed that the mean length of Erythroc
in the 1*, 2*, 3*, and 2*A pits were significantly
different (P(.05). See fig. 2
