and immersing the pieces in filtered seawater. The
settling chambers were swirled approximately every
ten minutes to prevent the spores from clumping.
The hypothesized infection mechanism was that
the spores moved to the pits by creeping and directed
rhizoids into the pits.
Experiment 1
Spores were settled upon a slide in petri dishes.
Laurencia cuttings were aligned perpendicular to the
slide with the apical tips facing the edge of the
slide. Spores were observed after eight hours to
note the direction of rhizoid growth. The dishes
were kept in a cold room at 15 C. The cultures were
illuminated by fluorescent light for 10 hours/day,
at an intensity of 19 uE/mesec.
Experiment 2
Laurencia cuttings were swirled in seawater containing
tatraspores. Eight cuttings were maintained in a
gallon jar with flowing water. Eight were kept in
petri dishes with filtered seawater. Eight were
kept in dry petri dishes to simulate a low tide.
The cuttings in filtered seawater were observed hourly
for approximately nine hours in order to detect spore
movement. The other cuttings were observed after
the same time period to note the infection rate.
Experiments 3,4,5
These were designed to determine the extent to
