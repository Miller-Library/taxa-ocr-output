which Erythrocystis relies on Laurencia.
Experiment 3
Spores obtained with swirling were kept in filtered
seawater. Upon germination, 2 ml Provasoli's nutrient
mixture, 1 ml penicillin-streptomycin and 1 ml germanium
dioxide were added to the petri dish.
Experiment 5
Erythrocystis thalli of sizes 5-10 mm were carefully
teased from their pits. Four were placed in petri
dishes with seawater which had Laurencia soaking in
it. Three were maintained in filtered seawater.
Four 20 cm X 20 cm quadrat samples were collected
haphazardly from Laurencia patchds at Stillwater Cove.
The Erythrocystis present were sexed (male, female,
tetrasporophyte, or juvenile), their length was measured
in millimeters, and their location on the host plant
was noted. The convention of 1*, 2*, and 3* branches
was used. In addition, thalli which were located on
a 2* branch, but not at the apex were scored as 2*A
(see fig. 1).
OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS
Experiment 1
The tetraspores treated in this experiment showed
patches where spores extended their rhizoids in the
same direction. The majority grew away from the
Laurencia tips.
