Observations:
1. Within a pit, either a male, female, or tetrasporophyte
plant occurred, not any combination of these. This
was observed in over 100 pits.
2. Six or more germlings were commonly found in
infected pits. Germlings were common in both the
pit of ultimate branches and in the apical pit of i*
2*, and 3* branches.
3. Thalli (ie.)1 mm in length) were found almost
exclusively in the apical pits. Dissection of several
pits infected by thalli indicated that only one or two
branched plants were present.
4. An Erythrocystis thallus in an apical pit may
arrest apical growth. Proliferous growth of lower
branches or accelerated growth of a single lower
branch follows. In the latter case, the branch grows
in the direction which resumes growth along the line
of the central axis.
SION
This study indicates that Erythroc
tis infection
can occur through the fortuitous settling and sticking
of spores to the proximal portion of Laurencia pacifica
trichoblasts. It is not conclusive that this is the
sole mechanism of infection. The concentration of
spores in the experimental culture dishes was far
reater than would be encountered in the field.
Although spore creeping was not observed, artifacts
