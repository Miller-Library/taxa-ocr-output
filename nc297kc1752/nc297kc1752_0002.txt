INTRODUCTION
Erythrocystis saccata (J.Ag.) Silva is a red alga
which occurs specifically in the terminal pits of
Laurencia pacifica Kyl. and a few related Laurencia
species (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976). The thalli
are ovate and contain mucilage. Red-pigmented, unicellular
rhizoids penetrate through the pit into the medulla
of Laurencia. At the tip of every branch of Laurencia,
there is a distinct pit filled by densely packed,
short cells. Distally, these cells elongate and become
filamentous trichoblasts.
By the criteria of Setchell (1918), Erythrocystis
is a parasite: it fulfills the two critical characteristics
of host penetration and reduced thallus. The third
criterion of reduced pigmentation is not apparent.
Detailed external (Kylin, 1928) and ultrastructural
(Kugrens, 1971) descriptions have been made on the
form and development of the vegetative and reproductive
structures. There is little known about the infective
mechanism of Erythrocystis. In other red algal parasites,
the process has been described. Feldmann and Feldmann
(1958) described how spores of Janczewskia verrucaeformis
Solms stuck to the host, Laurencia obtusa (Huds.)
Lamour, and formed rhizoids which penetrated the
intercortical cell walls. Kugrens and West (1973)
noted that Choreocolax polysiphoniae Reinsch infects
Polysiphonia lanosa (L.) Tandy by rhizoidal penetration
