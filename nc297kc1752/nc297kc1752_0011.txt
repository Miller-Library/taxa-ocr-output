The lack of tissue differentiation in some has promoted
ideas that some of these parasites (eg. Lobocolax,
Gonimophyllum and Gardneriella species) are actually
bacterial or viral galls.
In comparing the two different parasites of
Laurencia, we find two modes of infection, morphology,
and cell type, however it would interesting to
study the gradation between the two. Although Janzweskia
predominates on Laurencia spectabilis and Erythrocystis
predominates on L. pacifica, both are found on L. subopposita
and L. masonii. From L. spectabilis to L. pacifica, there
is a gradation from cartilaginous to pliant. Goff and
Cole (1976) suggested there may be enzymes used by
the parasites to dissolve host cell walls. The possibility
of a gradation of enzyme specificity is suggested here.
The potential of such work would give support for
the theory of an independent plant evolved into a
parasite and provide insight into the phylogenetic
relationships among the Laurencia species.
