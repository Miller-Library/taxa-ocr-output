in filtered seawater broke down within a week. The
spores maintained with Laurencia cuttings lasted
twice as long. Spores innoculated into the medulla of
Laurencia cuttings also degenerated before they ever
germinated.
The spores which were allowed to settle undisturbed
fell in concentrated patches. These were surrounded
by a sticky matrix which bound the spores together
and to the dish. These germinated within 24 hours.
The spores did not develop normally. Many formed
trichoblasts alone. Rhizoidal and trichoblast growth
appeared random. The thalli never developed beyond
the cell initial.
Erythrocystis thalli teased from Laurencia and
maintained in filtered seawater bleached within four
days. Those kept in normal seawater with the "essence"
of Laurencia lasted two weeks before bleaching.
Erythrocystis is not overtly detrimental to its
host nor does it appear dependent for photosynthate.
Local cell death is not evident. Laurencia produces
reproductive structures as normal, including spermatangia
in infected pits. As Kugrens (1971) noted, there are
no intimate cellular connections between Erythrocystis
and Laurencia. The present study demonstrated that
Erythrocystis can live for a time without its host.
