of culturing may have prevented it. Excessive mucus
secretion of spores and early trichoblast deterioration
may have been causes of negative results. The trichoblasts
are normally deciduous in maturing Laurencia, however
their uniform breakdown in culture suggests induced
deterioration.
The relationship between Erythrocystis and Laurencia
is a low level parasitism. Erythrocystis is not damaging
to its host and probably photosynthesizes normally.
Yet, it is clear that Erythrocystis is very dependent
on the Laurencia pacifica pits for normal spore germination
and development. Kugrens (1971) pointed out that
spores germinate and develop with polarity, while there
is no ultrastructural polarity in the tetraspore.
The aberrant growth of tetraspores in culture suggests
that the Laurencia pits may correct for a deficient
polarity system in Erythrocystis spores.
The size distribution (fig. 2) of Erythrocystis
on its host may be interpreted in two ways. Thallus
length may be assumed to correlate with age. Thus,
the primary Erythrocystis, which were the longest, were
the oldest. This opens the possibility that the
Laurencia pits become receptive to infection with
age: the first-formed pit is the first to be infected.
The other possibility is that there is apical
dominance due to hormones from the Erythrocystis
and/or the Laurencia. The enhanced growth observed
