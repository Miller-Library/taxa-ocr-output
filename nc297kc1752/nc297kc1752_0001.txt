ABSTRACT
Carpospores and tetraspores of Erythrocystis
adhered preferentially to the trichoblasts of Laurencia.
Infection of apical pits appeared to result from
fortuitous attachment of spores to the proximal end
of trichoblasts and extension of a unicellular rhizoid
into the pit. No spore motility was observed. Infection
rates in culture were approximately 30% for Laurencia
collected at Stillwater Cove and Hopkins Marine Station,
both areas in Monterey County, California. It is
notable that the Laurencia at Hopkins is not infected
by Erythrocystis in the field.
In a survey of Laurencia pacifica from Stillwater
Cove, it was found that up to 90% of the pits were
infected by Erythrocystis germlings. Male, female
and tetrasporophyte Erythrocystis occurred in the ratio
of 1:1:3. Erythrocystis thalli ()imm) predominated
in the apical pits. The mean lengths of thalli from
four locations on the Laurencia were significantly
different (P(.05): 1*)2*)2*4)3*.
