through the cortex or germination within a wound. Goff and
Cole (1976) worked on Harveyella mirabilis (Reinsch)
Schmitz and Reinke. Their experiments showed that
the parasite probably infected Holmsella pachyderma
(Reinsch) Sturch through wounds made by algal grazers.
Spores attached themselves to the wound by a rhizoid,
Subsequently, a primary filament extended into the
medulla where it branched and spread. The parasite
emerged in pustules of host and parasite cells.
The present study sought to elaborate various
aspects of the life history of Erythrocystis: how it
infects a host, the nature of the symbiosis, and its
distribution upon the host.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Erythrocystis saccata and Laurencia pacifica
were collected at Stillwater Cove, Pebble Beach,
California, between -1.0 to +1.0 ft. tide levels.
Collections of uninfected Laurencia pacifica were made
near West Beach at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California.
The tetraspores of Erythrocystis were used in all
experiments. They were indistinguishable from carpospores
using light microscopy. It was assumed that both
types of spores used a similar method of host infection.
Spores were obtained by: severing the base of
fertile thalli, drawing out the excess mucilage with
paper toweling, quartering the thallus longitudinally,
