Introduction
Acclimation' with respect to temperature is a widespread,
species-specific phenomenon, and has been studies extensively
by many previous researchers. (Edney, 1964, Edney, 1961, Prosser,
1961). In a study of Porcellio Laevus by Edney (1964), no sig-
nificant acclimation was found with respect to respiration
measurements. Significant results were obtained for P. Laevus
when lethal temperature measurements were carried out, however,
and the differences were thought to be attributable to temper-
ature acclimation. In the isopod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Armadillidium : Exact'>Armadillidium</span> Vulgare,
presumably a more terrestrial species, acclimation was demon-
strated in both metabolic rate and L.T. 50 (lethal temperature
at which 50% die) determinations. A good synopsis of the
literature may be found in Prosser (1961), as well as theories
concerning the biological bases for such physiological adapt-
ations.
In my brief study, no significant metabolic rate differ-
ences were obtained between P. Scaber populations kept at five
degrees C, Fifteen degrees C, and ambient air temperatures for
a period of two weeks. No significant differences were found
for L. T. 50 measurements either, but due to small sample sizes
and a stringent assumption of normality for the analysis used,
conclusions cannot be made with any certainty.
1. According to Edney (1964), Acclimation is defined as any
compensatory change in response to temperature resulting
fron events in an individual's lifetime.
Methods
For the habitat study, relative humidity was measured with
a portable Honeywell relative humidity indicator. The probe
was placed under the iceplant, where the population of isopods
was found. Humidity measurements were recorded hourly for
the two day study period. This data was used to ascertain
a mean humidity value to be used for the lab populations.
Acclimation studies were carried out on animals subjected
to a constant temperature of either 5, 15, or 25 degrees C.
for a period of two weeks. Edney (1964) indicated that for the
genus Porcellio this length of time was sufficient for total
acclimation to occur. The animals were placed in small glass
habitats, one habitat per temperature and 100 animals per
habitat. Constant high humidity was ensured by placing water
resevoirs in the bottom of each enclosure.
Other methods used in the experimental technique and analysis
will be discussed in the appropriate sections.
Part I: Field Studies
In order to determine the habitat of the P. Scaber populat-
ion I studied, hourly temperature and humidity measurements were
taken in the field for a period of two days. The results are
shown in fig. 1. "Within habitat" temperatures were taken with
a thermistor probe implanted where the aggregation of isopods
was found. "Above habitat" temperatures were taken ten cent-
imeters above the location of the population. The mean "in
habitat" relative humidity was 93% with a range of 87% to 96%.
A study of the size differences between males and females
indicated that a large dimorphism was present. From these
results (fig. 2) I decided to study males only, to exclude
respiration differences brought about by sex alone.
Part II: L.T. 50 Measurements
The apparatus used consisted of a constant temperature
bath, accurate to within .2 degrees centigrade in which a
test chamber containing the isopods was immersed. A moist-
ened piece of filter paper placed in the chamber ensured a
high humidity during the tests. Each test was carried out with
ten randomly selected animals of one acclimation group, for a
period of one hour. For each group, three temperatures were
found which produced mortalities between 10% and 90%. The
results are plotted on probit paper with a log temperature
scale. (fig. 3). The control group was found to have signif-
icantly higher L.T. 50 levels than the other two groups, but

this cannot be substantiated due to possible non-normalities
present in the data.
Part III: Respiration Measurements
Respiration measurements were carried out using a Warburg
constant volume respirometer. Each run consisted of hourly
measurements of respiration for a six hour period, and a mean
hourly rate was calculated for each of ten animals. Regression
lines were fitted to the data and the results are shown in figs.
4,5, and 6. 910 values for each acclimation group were not
computed because the data indicated that this varied consider-
ably with the weight of the animal.
To compare the acclimation groups, a composite of figs. 4,
5, and 6 was made for a standard animal of 30 mg. weight. This
data is presented in fig. 7. Differences between the five
degree and fifteen degree groups were not significant, but
differences between the control group and the other two groups
were significant at the .05 level. This difference can be attrib-
uted to several confounding factors, none of which involve
acclimation. Firstly, mean environmental temperature of the
control group's habitat was 10.2 degrees centigrade, and an
elevation of this curve with respect to the 15 degree group is
to be expected. Secondly, behavioral differences exist which
were not controlled for between the control population and the
laboratory population.

Part IV: Discussion
Many error terms were present in the experimental method
which could have been eliminated. Larger vessels, perhaps of
aquarium size, could have been used for the lab populations
to ensure that crowding did not cause behavioral modifications.
The control population should have been enclosed in a vessel
identical to those used for the lab population. More data should
have been collected for the L.D. 50 calculations.
