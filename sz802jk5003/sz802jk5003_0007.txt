of Loop 4 and the rectum. The pellets are readily broken
up, making them easily washed out of the nuchal cavity
when the animal is splashed. Often if the animal has not
been exposed to water for some time, fecal pellets may
fill both sides of the mantle cavity.
In the comparative study of the gut in species of
Acmaea, differences between species were observed in
the length and placement of the radula sac in the body,
the jaw, the salivary glands, and the gut loops.
LENGTH AND PLACEMENT OF THE RADULA SAC
The radula sac of all species except Acmaea scutum
extends only to the mid-visceral region (Figures3 and 4).
The radula sac of A. scutum passes farther to the left
and extends to the posterior visceral region before
passing anteriorly again (Figure 4). The radula sac
of A. scutum is almost twice the length of the shell,
while in the other species it rarely exceeds 1.5 times
the shell length (Table 1).
THE JAW
For species comparison, the jaw was removed, the
muscle scraped away from the lower side, and the jaw
then examined microscopically. When jaws were mounted
vater
in fluid on slides, the cover slips were slightly prop-
then
ped up to avoid breaking the jawsor bending severely.
Approximately 10 jaws, taken from animals ranging from
small to large, were examined for each species (Figure 5).
