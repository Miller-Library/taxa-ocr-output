Previous and contemporary workers have noted some
dietary differences between California species of Acmaea
(e.g., Test, 1945, 1946; Craig, 1966; Eaton, 1966), and
have noted some species differences in the radula and
radula strap (e.g., Test, 1945, 1946; Fritchman, 1960,
1961), which also may be related to diet. No similar
attempts have been made to compare the digestive tracts
or jaws of California limpets, though these too might
be expected to show some variation possibly related to
food habits. In the present work, the gross morphology
of the gut has been compared in the following species:
A. asmi (Middendorf, 1849); A. digitalis Eschscholtz,
1833; A. limatula Carpenter, 1864; A. pelta Eschscholtz,
1833; A. scabra (Gould, 1846); A. scutum Eschscholtz,
1833: The jaws have been studied in these six species
and also in A. insessa (Hinds, 1842), A. paradigitalis
Fritchman, 1960, and Lottia gigantea Sowerby, 1843.
