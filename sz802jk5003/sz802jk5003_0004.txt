into the buccal or oral cavity which contains a series
of pouches, grooves, the radula, and the naw. The radula
sac begins just behind the buccal mass and cavity.
Passing straight back over the head muscles, it enters
the anterior side of the visceral mass. It passes between
the intestinal loops and stomach, curves to the right
and forms a loop surrounded by the digestive gland, and
extends anteriorly again, rising up over the top of the
gland where often it can be seen when the shell and
dorsal body wall are removed. Reentering the head
cavity at the same point at which it left, the sac
ends in a fleshy knob or caecum which secretes the radula
(Fretter and Graham, 1962,p. 173; Runham, 1963).
The jaw, a pliable chitinous structure, is posi¬
tioned anteriodorsal to the oral cavity (Figures 2 and
6). It protects the upper lip from the scraping move¬
ment of the radula teeth, and prevents food from escaping
the buccal cavity (Fretter and Graham, 1962, p. 168).
In Acmaea and Lottia gigantea there is a single symme-
trical jaw, with four wingtlike extensions that are
opaque, white, and fairly flexible. The smaller anterior
wings overlap the posterior wings on the dorsal side.
Muscles attached to the bases of the wings run to the
body wall and buccal mass. Across the anterior mid¬
portion of the jaw runs a harder band, which becomes
reddish-brown in older animals.
