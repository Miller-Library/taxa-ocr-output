in the exact placement of the loops occurs within the
individual species depending on the size of the animal
and the degree of maturity of the gonad. However, there
is a characteristic placement of the loops in each species.
In Acmaea peltay A. scutum, and A. scabra Loop l circles
farther posteriorly. Loop 2 is considerably smaller
in A. digitalis, A. scabra, and A. asmi. In A. asmi
the anterior portionsof Loops 1 and 2 extend farther
anterior reltive to the stomach. In A. digitalis,
and A. scabra Loop 3 does not lie as far to the left as
in the other species. Dorsoventral thickness of the
visceral mass is difficult to show in the drawings; in
A. limatula and A. scutum, both rather flat species,
the loops lie beside or just beneath one another.
In the other species with taller shells the loops pass
back and forth from ventral to dorsal regions as they
twist through the digestive gland. The digestive tracts
in A.pelta, A. limatula, and A. scutum are somewhat
greater in diameter than those of the other species;
this is a consistent difference, which appears related
to diet but shows up whether the gut is full or empty.
The stomach of A. pelta often contains sizable fragments
of larger algae, and this species has been shown by
Craig (1966) to feed mainly on larger red, brown, and
green algae. The gut in A. limatula, which feeds mainly
on flat encrusting red algae (Eaton, 1966) contains
smaller fragments. The gut contents of A. scutum obÂ¬
