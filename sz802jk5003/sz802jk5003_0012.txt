mantle was removed by dissection, and the animals mounted
on slides in cedar wood oil. The limpets had been
feeding, and the digestive tract was dark and clearly
distinguishable through the remaining more transparenfk
tissues.
The results of these studies are shown in Figures
9 - 11. Limpets 0,5 - 1.5 mm in shell length have a
relatively short stomach and intestine, and intestinal
Loops 1, 2, and 3 are not evident, though there are
twists in the gut. Loop 4 and the rectum are :in the
normal position. Limpets 1.5 - 2.5 mm in length have
Loops 1, 2, and 3 but these are not fully developed
(Figure 12). When the shell reaches 2.5 - 3.5 mm in
length the digestive tract is almost the same as that
in the lrger animals (Figure 13). Placement of the
inner Loops 1, 2, and 3 may be slightly out of regular
orientation, but this displacement is random. The
radula sac is easily seen in its normal posifion.
COELOMIC SYSTEM
The coelomic system consists of four interconnected
cavities in the visceral mass: the right and left kidneys,
the pericardium, and the gonad. The points of inter-
connection lie anteriorly on the right side of the viscÂ¬
eral mass, just behind the muscular wall of the nuchal
cavity (Figure?12).
The right kidney, easily identified by its dark
green to brown color, encircles the whole visceral mass,
