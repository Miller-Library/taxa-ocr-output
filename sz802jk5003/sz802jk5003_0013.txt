with its distal end just posterior to the pericardium.
Internally its surface is quite irregular. The large
right renal-genital pore has thick muscular lips and
is just to the right of the anal opening. The pore on
Acmaea scabra is much larger than that in the other
species, and even exceeds the size of the anus. The
left kidney is much smaller and difficult to distinguish
from the muscular wall separating the pallial and visceral
cavities. It is situated just back of the nuchal cavity,
between the midline and the anus, and overlies part of
the rectum (Figure 12). A. digitalis and A. scabra
both have relatively large left kidneys. The left
renal pore is a narrow slit opening on the anterior
surface of the middle of the kidney (Figure 13). Only
in A. digitalis are there very small bulbous lips on
each side of the slit.
The pericardium occupies the space above the gonad
reoy
in the left dorsal anterior a of the visceral mass.
From it the reno-pericardial canal (Figure 13) crosses
the body from left to right and, as in Lottia gigantea
(see Fisher, 1904), divides just under the left kidney,
one canal going to the left kidney and one under the
rectum to the right kidney.
The gonad is situated in the hollow above the foot
beneath the digestive system. During the breeding
season when it is greatly enlarged it extends up around
the qut. The duct is merely an extension of the thin
