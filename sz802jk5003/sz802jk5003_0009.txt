the two buccal or anterior salivary glands extend along
the esophagus, their posterior ends lying on the esophaÂ¬
to the
gus, rear of the posterior salivary glands (Figure 6).
The ducts of the buccal glands of A. pelta, A. scabra,
and A. asmi are shorter and wind back and forth several
times across the head muscles (Figure 7). In these
species the distal extremities of the buccal glands
terminate near the posterior margin of the buccal mass
on either side.
In Acmaea digitalis, A. scabra, and A. limatula
the very numerous posterior salivary glands extend
straight out from the pharynx dilation and anterior
esophagus (Figure 6). In A. pelta and A. scutum
the pharynx dilation is wider than in the above species
and the twist of the esophagus more apparent. (Figure 7).
The glands here are slightly smaller, and curve ventrally
around the foregut. In A. asmi the posterior salivary
glands are very small, and light green in color, while
in the other species they are white. A count of glands
was attempted, but an exact number was difficult to
obtain. The left side of the esophagus has about 65
glands, while the right side has a slightly smaller
number, the number varying somehat with size of the
animal and the species.
LOOPING OF THE GUT
The length and placement of the gut loops in six
species of limpets is shown in Figure 8. Some variation
