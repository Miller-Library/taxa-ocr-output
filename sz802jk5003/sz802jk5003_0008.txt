The jaw remains the same size, relative to the size of
the animal, as growth occurs. With age, however, the
anterior band gets harder and darker. The median ridges
of the band become more prom-inent, possible as a
result of wear caused by scraping of the radula,
In Figure 5 the jaws of large adult specimens of
the species studied are arranged according to an increase
in the irregularity of the anterior band. Acmaea asmi,
A. limatula, and A. scutum show little or no marking on
the band, and the anterior margin is smooth and unridged.
A. scabra, A. digitalis, and A. paradigitialis have small
ridges in the medial region of the band, causing the
margin to be slightly uneven. In A. insessa, A. pelta,
and Lottia gigantia the anterior band bears a conspicuous
median tooth with smaller ridges running along it. This
characteristic is most apparent in A. pelta, which also
has a darker anterior band. The undulating anterior
border of the anterior band in the jaw of Lottia is
rather distinctive. Species differences in shape of the
lateral wings of the jaw are less apparent, though?
variations occur in wing shape and in the relative size
of the anterior and posterior wings.
ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SALIVARY GLANDS
The anterior and posterior salivary glands show
some variation in placement and size in the species
examined. In Acmaea digitalis, A. limatula, and A. scutum
