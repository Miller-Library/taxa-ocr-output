Additional observations have been made on the development
of the digestive tract in very young Acmaea, and on the
interconnection of the coelomic cavities in the six species.
METHODS
All specimens examined were collected on Mussel
Point, near the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
California, and at Point Pinos and Point Joe nearby on
the Monterey Peninsula, during April and May, 1966.
Dissections were made on animals killed in 95% alcohol.
Since this type of preservation, making tissues more
pliable, introduced distortion of certain structures,
comparisons were made with fresh material also. Injection
of Ward's latex solution was used to determine placement
of gland ducts and intestinal loops. Starvation of the
animals for 3 - 5 days before injection proved helpful
in clearing the digestive tract, though injection of thee
entire tract was never successful.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
The gross anatomy of the digestive tract of the
Acmaea species studied (Figures 1 and 2) is similar to
that of Acmaea virginea (Muller) as described by Fretter
and Graham (1962; pp. 149-239, 477-509), and Lottia
gigantea (see Fisher, 1904). The mouth opens ventrally
