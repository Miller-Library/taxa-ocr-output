extend out laterally and, in some species, ventrally
around the esophagus. These glands open into tiny
pockets, which in turn are divisions of the lateral
sacculations of the esophageal wall. Like the esophageal
folds, the glands and pharynx dilation appear twisted
as a result of torsion.
The esophagus passes into the proventriculus or
forechamber of the stomach, which opens into the stomach
by way of a contractable aperture encircled by numerous
small folds. The stomach forms a wide loop, encircling
the digestive gland. In sexually mature individuals
the gonad is sometimes visible laterally beyond the
stomach margin.
The digestive gland occupies the central region
of the visceral hump, slightly overlapping the inner
margin of the stomach and almost completely covering
the right lateral pootions. A single digestive gland

duct enters the stomach near its prorimalend. The
volume and color of the gland vary somewhat with species
and with the size of the animal.
The hind gut makes a series of four loops before it
empties into the rectum. (Figure 2). Loops 1 and 4

clockwise. The rectum begins where Loop 4 crosses the
anterior portion of the stomach. Constriction of the
feces into linked pellets occurs in the latter portion
