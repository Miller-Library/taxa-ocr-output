Figure 8:
Diagrams of the stomach, intestine, and rectum of adult
individuals of six species of Acmaea,based on dissections
of 25 - 30 animals of each species. Exact placement of
the loops is subject to slight variation, within each species;
the diagrams show the typical condition in large adults.
RCT - rectum, ST - stomach.
