In A. pelta and A. scutum the posterior salivary
glands are slightly smaller, and curve ventrally
around the foregut, while in the other species
the glands etend straight out from the pharynx
and esophagus.
The pattern of gut loops showa minor but consistent
differences between Acmaea species. Development
of the adult pattern of loops is essentially comÂ¬
pleted before animals reach a shell length of Amm.
The gut tends to be thicker and heavier in species
feeding on larger erect or encrusting algae (A. pelta,
A. limatula, A. scutum) than in species feeding on
films of microscopic algae (A. digitalis, A. scabra
A. asmi).
The coelomic cavities and ducts are described and
diagramed. Both right and left kidneys of A. digitalis
and A. scabra are relatively larger than those of
other Acmaea species.
Aneexcellent paper by Righi (1966), published after
the present study was completed, describes the internal
anatomy of the Brazilian species of Acmaea and provides
illustrations permitting comparisons to be made between
Brazilian and Californian species. Righi also finds that
the shape of the jaw and the looping of the gut provide
means of distinguishing Acmaea species.
