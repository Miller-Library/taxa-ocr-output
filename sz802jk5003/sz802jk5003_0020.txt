Figure 3:
Dorsal view showing the placement of the radula sac in the
visceral cavity of Acmaea limatula (shell length - 2.5cm.;
ratio of radula lenghh: shell length - 1.11). Placement
of the sac here is similar to that in A. pelta, A. scabra,
A. digitalis, and A. asmi. ES - esophagus, RC - Radula
caecum, RS - radula sac, ST - stomach.
Figure 4:
