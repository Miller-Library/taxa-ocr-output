Studies on the jaw, digestive system, and Goelomic
derivatives in representatives of the genus Acmaea (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia)
Veliger
. -- Placement and extent of the radula sac, the
form of the jaw, the arrangement of the salivary glands, the looping of the gut,
and the interconnections of coelomic derivatives are described and illustrated for
Acmaea asmi, A. digitalis, A. limatula, A. pelta, A. scutun, A. scabra. The ratio
of radula length/shell length is nearly 2 in A. scutum and 1-1.5 in other Acmaea
species. Jaws vary in shape; the hard anterior band in A. pelta, A. insessa,
and Lottia gigantea bears an anterior median tooth. Salivary glands vary between
species in length of ducts, size and position of glands. The pattern of gut loops
hows minor but consistent differences between Acmaea species. Development of the
Fadult pattern of loops is essentially completed before animals reach a shell length of
4 mm. The gut tends to be thicker and heavier in species feeding on larger erect or
encrusting algae (A. pelta, A. limatulà, A. scutum) than in species feeding on films
of microscopic algae (47 digitalis, A. Scabra, A. asmi) Limpets from the high
intertidal zone (A. digitalisaand A. scabra) have relatively larger right and left
kidneys than do Acmaea species from lower levels.
