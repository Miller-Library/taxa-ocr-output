epithelium that surrounds the gonad (Figure 13). It
arises on the antero-dorsal wall of the gonad in the
midline and extends to the right to open into the right
kidney. Gametes pass from the gonad to the right kidney,
and leave the kidney through the right renal-genital pore.
SUMMARY
Placement and extent of the radular sac, the form
1.
of the jaw, the arrangement of the salivary glands,
the looping of the gut, and the interconnections of
coelomic derivatives are described and illustrated
for Acmaea: A. asmi, A. digitalis, A. limatula,
A. pelta, A. scabra, A. scutum, A. insessa, A. para-
digitalis. Some notes on Lottia gigantea are included.
The radula of A. scutum is almost twice the length
of its shell, while in the other species the radula
ranges from 1 - 1.5 times the length of the shell.
Limpet jaws vary primarily in the shape and character
of the hard anterior band. The jaws of K. pelta,
A. insessa, and Lottia gigantea bear an anterior
median tooth.
The limpets studied can be separated into two groups
on the basis of the salivary glands. A. digitalis,
A. limatula, and A. scutum.have buccal glands that
extend down the esophagus posterior to the esophgeal
glands, while in the other species they terminate
near the posterior margin of the buccal mass.
