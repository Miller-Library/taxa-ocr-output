Behind the oral cavity lie the pharynx dilation,
and the esophagus. The latter extends backward to enter
the visceral mass slightly to the left of the midline.
Curving to the right it passes upward through the
digestive gland and ends just under the dorsal surface
of the gland inna mid-dorsal position. The greater
and lesser folds of the esophagus follow the course
described by Fisher (1906, pp. 10-11) in Lottia. The
lesser fold begins in the mid-ventral region of the
pharynx, twists counter-clockwise as viewed from the
rear, and finally reaches a dorsal position just before
it ends. The greater folds, which begin dorsally, are
twwisted so they come to lie ventrally at the posterior
end of the esophagus. The twisting of the esophagus
is the result of torsion in the veliger stage. Lateral
pouches or sacculations are found between the greater
and lesser folds. They become smaller and finally
disappear as the esophagus curves to the right in the
mid-visceral region (Figure 7).
The paired buccal glands lie along or under the midÂ¬
esophagus. Their ducts, which overlie the head muscles
and empty into the oral cavity on dorso-lateral folds,
are white and prominent.
The numerous posterior salivary, or esophageal glands
lie on either side of the pharynx dilation and esophagus.
The are conspicuous, small, finger-like processes that
