served in the present study resembled those found in
A. limatula. In contrast A. digitalis, A. scabra, and
A. asmi are known to eat microscopic green and blue¬
green algae and diatoms (Castenholz,1961; Fritchman, 1961;
Haven, 1965). The gut contents of these three species
consists at very finely divided material.
Looping of the gut is less complex in the smallest
limpets. In order to determine at what stages the small
limpets develop the adult pattern of intestinal coils,
small limpets, 0.5 - 5.0 mm in shell length, were examined.
Animals 3 to 5 mm long could be identified to species.
They were preserved and dissected ;in the usual way.
Results showed that the digestive tract was present
in essentially the adult condition. Still smaller
individuals (1-2 mm in shell length) probably represent¬
ing Acmaea scabra and A. digitalis were collected in
a small splash pool in the high intertidal zone, which
contained only large A. scabra and A. digitalis.
Minute specimens (0.5 - 2.0 mm in shell length) of
these species and probably A. pelta as well, were also
collected.in the crevices among Mytilus californianus
Conrad 1837, Tetraclita squamosa Darwin, 1854, and
Mitella polymerus (Sowerby, 1833). These tiny limpets
were killed and preserved in 70% alcohol, dehydrated
in an alcohol series (Ehe shells being removed in 95%
alcohol), and cleared in cedar wood oil. The foot and
