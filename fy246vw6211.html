suores by the Hopkins Marine Station, Facific Grove, California.
The first four are found in the intertidil with more or
less overlap ing distributions. Although excellent keys
exist, notibly that of Schmitt (1921), for distinguishing
anong the adults, little information is availible on the
larvae and juveniles of thase species. Throuch the vork
of Thompson (1903), Hays (1939), and Goffin (1950), the
larvae and immature adults of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. samuelis</span> can be identified;
However the larvae and juveniles of the other soocies ire
not recognizable on the basis of published accounts. For
the present work an ittempt has been made to determine means
for identifving the larvae of the first five aforementioned
species ind the voung adults of the first four.
Metnods
Collections were made througneut the intertiail region
t kopkins Marine Station to obt in gravid femiles ind
Imaiture adults of the first four species named. Cne gravid
famale of P. ochotensis was obtuined by diving at a depth
of about eight meters; no inmature idults were found.
samples were obtained of P. beringanus.
The gravid females were kept in two-liter flasks of
seaater in the laboratory until their larvae hatched. On
hatching, twenty-five of the most active larvie of aach
srecies were placed in each of two finger bowls and the

water temperature maintained at approximately 13° C. Once
a day the water was changed, after which the lurrae were
fed <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Artemia nauplii : Exact'>Artemia nauplii.</span>
Whenever possible, characteristics cnosen for larval
identification were those which could oe observed with a
dissecting microscope, although a compound microscope was
occasionally necessary. Gross morphology was found to be
similar for all species; for this reason the following key
emphasizes differences in pigmentation.
No characteristics of the glaucothoe were found to be
sufficiently prominent for rapid identification; therefore
a more detailed study was undertaken, examining the structure
of the telson, uropods, and pleopods under 400X magnification.
In all cases, the specimens were lignted from above
rather than from below because the pigmentation was not
always visible in transmitted light. Both living and
preserved larvae were studied, but, in order to prevent
errors from shrinkage and movement, all measurements were
made immediately after the larvae had been killed in
magnesium chloride, chloral hydrate, or a combination of
both. The larvae were measured dorsally from the most
anterior part of the head in the midline immediately below
the rostrum to the central notch on the posterior edge of
the telson. Measurements were tiken at each larval instir
available daring the study.
Time lid not permit raising the species pist metamorphosis.
For this reason the species characteristics of juveniles and
small adults were determined by starting with adult specimens
lirge enough to be clearly identified by Schmitt's key (1921)
and working down to progressivelv smaller individuals of
each species. For tnese animals, the wilth of the hard
carapice vas used is a measure of size, following Coffin
(1950), althouzh the curvature of the cartpace made such
measurement difficult. Eich specimen was ilso geasired
from the tip of the median tooth of the rostrim to the
tip of the V-shaped indentation on the posterior edge of
the carapace. Since this part of the key was degeloped
for ready use in the field, it also emphasizes coloratien
and patterning rather than minute merphological differences,
Examples of larval and post-largal charictenistics
were recorded with photographs and camera lucida dravings.
Results
General larval characteristics may be found in
Coffin (1060). Specific charicteristics of the larvie
ire shown in Tables I through VIII. In these taoles,
all areae on the bodv are colorless unless otherwise
noted. Two colored regions are similar in all five
species: a vellow area anterier to the heart and dorsal
to the stomach and a red oral region fading to orange
or vellow-orange in the viscera. The vellow pigmentation
noted on the proximal medial face of the maxillipes in the
First zooa o" P. hirsutiusculus is distinctive but mav eisily
be missed unless the lighting is carefilly adjusted. The
pi ment locks the same as that found in the yellow area
anterior to the heart and is visiple only when lighted
indirectly from above. This coloration was observed
occasionally in the second zoea, put rarely in a later stage.
while the table emphasizes pigmentition, certiin
morphological characteristics ire alse prominent enough
to be of value for rapid identification. Exam'nation of
the one available specimen of third zoea <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. ochotensis
indicated</span> that there may be more spines on the uropods
of this species tnan on those of the intertidal species.
Spines on the uropods of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. granosimanus</span> ind P. hemchillii
re all approximately the same, while in P. samuelis and
P. hirsutiusculus the most proximal spine is much smaller
or is often missing, apparently as a result of breakage.
where high magnification (400X) is available, the
number of prominent spines on the exopodite of the second
antennu provides a definite morphological characteristic
helpful in partially separating the five species. The
eight antennal spines on P. ocnotensis are evenly
separited
seines
and readily distinguishable; however the most iist
of the other species are close together and usually are
not discernable except under higner magnification.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Glaucothoe : Exact'>Glaucothoe</span> stages of only P. hirsutiusculus ind
P. granosimanus were available for examination.
Extensive collection of the immature adults yielded
crabs of all the species except P. ocnotensis and
P. beringanis, ranging in size from those described in
Schmitt's key (1921) to tne following mininum crapace
widtus: P. samuelis-O.5mm, P. nirsutiusculis-O.6mn,
P. granosimanus-O.8mm, and P. hem hillii-1.1nw. By
cemparing overlapping characteristics, it was possiole
to assign inlividuals of even the smallest size to the
proper soecies. Their charactristics, as thev cainged
with increasing size, ire sown in Tables IX to XIII.
The smallest gravid females found had carapace vidths of
1.5mm for P. samuelis and 1.2 mm for P. hirsutiusculis.
The same color patterns exhipited by these females were
found in crabs ranging down to carapace widths of 1.2nm
for P. samuelis and 1.0 mm for P. nirsitiusculus. Egg-
bearing specimens of P. granosimands ind P. hemphillii
were not found in sufficient numbers for any minimum size
at sexual maturity to be determined.
One morphological feature of the post-larval inlividuals
worthy of mention is the shape of the rostrum. In linge
specimens of P. granosimanus, the median projection o" the
frent of the carapace is proadly rounded, short and very
blunt, in accordance with Schmitt's key (1921). In
specimens of P. grinosimanus hiving a carapace width of
about 2.5mm or less and in the other three species in ill
post-larval stages, the rostrum is rather sharply pointed.
Discussion
In both the larval and post-larval specimens, axamination
revealed jefinite similarities between P. samelis ind
P. hirsutiusculus and between P. granosimanus anl P. hemohillii.
In the larvae, P. ochotensis formed a third group. Individuals
could pe assigned relatively easily to one group or inother
by the use of pigmentation and morphology; however, it wis
frequently exceedingly difficult and oc asionally impossible
to determine the species of an inlividual vithin one of these
species pairs. The tables are so designed is to emplisize
these sigilarities.
Provenzano (1964) suggests that the number of mijor
telson proces es in the glaucothoe may be a good familial

character, i.e. all the species of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Paguridae : Exact'>Paguridae</span> for which data
hive been published bear eight such procestes.
Tor
P. granosimanus this was found to be valid.
However, of saven specimens of P. hirsutiusculus
studjed, only one was found to have eight setae. Five
of the other six specimens had six setie and one specimen
had only five. On the specimen with five setae, one of
the medial setae apparently had been lost; while there
was no visible trace of its point of attachment, there
was a gap in the pattern. On the specimens pearing six
setie, no trices were seen which suggested the loss of any
processes.
On the basis of the specimens examined, the normal
number of setae appears to be six; nowever, in light.
of the one exception studied and the previously published
data on Paguridae, it is probaple that the numbor of
telson setae or the glaucothoe of P. hirsutiusculus is
also eight.
In his study of P. samuelis, Coffin (1960) states that
the smallest sexually mature females ne found during
the summer months had a carapace width of 1.8 mm. wnereas
Je encountered a number of gravid females meisuring only
1.5 mm across.

distinguished without the use of a high magnification
microscope. P. samuelis and P. hirsutiusculus, P
granosimanus and P. hemphillii, ind P. ochotensis could
easily be separated into the above groups but further
identification proved difficult in the young adults and
sogetimes impossible in the larvae. The following
