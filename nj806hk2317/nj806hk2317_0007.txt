of the blue iodine-starch complex as an indicator of amylase
activity.
The fluorometric technique was capable of detecting
the production of as little as 6 x 10-11 moles glucose/min.
The reducing sugar test of Somogyi as modified by Nelson
could detect about 3 x 10-8 moles of reducing sugar.
Protein was measured spectrophotometrically by both
the method of Warburg and Christian (1941) and Lowry et. al.
(1951). Protein content was assumed to reflect enzyme
content, since the observed rates were closely related to
enzyme concentration (a twofold increase in extract approxÂ¬
imating a twofold increase in rate). The activities are
therefore expressed as moles TPNI formed per minute per
milligram protein.
Commercial sources of enzymes and substrates:
Hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Boehringer
and Sohne), isocitrate, glucose, TFN, and ATP (Sigma Chemical
Company), lactose (Nutritional Biochemical Corporation), and
maltose (Difco Laboratories). The laminarin and starch were
prepared by Dr. John Phillips of Hopkins Marine Station.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
Enzyme activities determined fluorometrically, are
isted in Table 1. The lack of amylase activity in unferti-
lized eggs and in veligers was also supported qualitatively
