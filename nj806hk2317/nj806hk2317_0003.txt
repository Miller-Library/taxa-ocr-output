This report describes some enzyme activities related
to carbohydrate metabolism during embryonic development of
the gastropod, Acmaea scutum (Escholtz, 1833). Data are
presented on activities of enzymes releasing free glucose
from various polysaccharides, on hexokinase (an enzyme com-
mon to both the pentose shunt and glycolysis), glucose-é¬
phosphate dehydrogenase (an enzyne of the pentose shunt),
and isocitrate dehydrogenase (an enzyme of the citric acid
eyele).
MATERTALS AND METION
Obtaining and culturing gametes:
Adult A. scutum were collected from an area on
Cypress Point in Pebble Beach, California. The animals
were removed from their shell, and the dorsal body wall
ruptured near the posterior end of the animal, with care
taken not to puncture the nearby digestive gland. Parts
of the ovaries from five females were removed with a
forceps, agitated in alkaline sea water to remove the
mature eggs, and then treated as described below to remove
the chorion. Sperm were obtained by agitating the testes
in 25 ml of normal filtered sea water, and filtering the
suspension through a double layer of cheesecloth.
