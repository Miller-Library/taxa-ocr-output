SUNMMARY:
Activity of embryonic carbohydrases, hexokinase,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydroÂ¬
genase were analyzed fluorometrically in the unfertilized
eggs, trocophores, and veligers of the limpet Acmaea scutum.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydro-
genase activity was constant at all stages. Hexokinase
activity increased almost threefold between the trocophore
and veliger stage. No maltase, galactosidase, or amylase
activity was detectable at any stage. A laminarinase-type
enzyme, capable of degrading algal laminarin to free glucose
was found in all embryonic stages. The role of laminarinase
in unfertilized eggs is puzzling since the substrate for
this enzyme is not available until feeding begins at the
veliger stage.
