The eggs, trocophores, or veligers were divided into
two parts and centrifuged. One sample was suspended in 2.5
ml buffer (0.05M TEA, pH7.6), the other in 2 mi buffer-
0.5 ml of ovomucoid solution (also suspended in buffer),
and both samples then disrupted in a Dounce honogenizer at
0 degrees centigrade. The volumes of embryos used ranged
from 0.05 - 0.1 ml packed cells per 2.5 ml. All preparations
were assayed for enzyme activity at 26 degrees centigrade.
Fluorometric assays:
Because of the small amounts of embryos obtainable,
sensitive fluorometric techniques, based upon the absorption
of TrNI at 366 mu and its fluorescence at wavelengths greater
than 420 mu were utilized to measure enzyme activity. Using
incubation mixtures described below, glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (C6PDh) and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity
were determined by direct measurement of TPNH formation;
hexokinase (HK) activity was measured by coupling its prodÂ¬
uct, glucose-6-r04, with excess G6PDh, to yield TPNI; and
carbohydrases releasing free glucose measured by coupling
glucose production to HK and CoPDh in the presence of excess
ATP.

reaction mix contained, per ml, 43 umoles TEA buffer (pl 7.6)
