Perhaps the most interesting discovery is that the
eggs and early embryonic stages of A. scutum possess an
enzyme (s) capable of releasing glucose from laminarin. The
acwt
rate of this enzyme, however, was non-linear under the pres-
ent assay conditions, and therefore no comparison of activity
was attempted.
The role of the enbryonic laminarinase in the egg and
early trocophore stages is difficult to visualize, since
neither of these are feeding stages. The veliger, however,
does feed, and could certainly utilize a minarinase-type
enzyme for digestion of the large amount of algal laminarin
found near the surf zone in small fragments of brown algae.
If the veligers are degrading laminarin to free glucose in
their natural environment the sharp increase in HK activity
(Fig. 1), also found at this stage, could result from free
glucose made available by laminarinase. ZF activity,
however, appears to remain relatively constant during
development.
Another possibility, which is presently being investi
gated, is that the observed laminarinase activity actually
reflects 81,3 glucanase activity involved in the breakdown
of cellular glyco-proteins.
