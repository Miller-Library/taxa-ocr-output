during Embryonic Development of Acmaea scutum (Mollusca:
Gastropoda: Prosobranchia). The Veliger
Activity of embryonic carbohydrases, hexokinase,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase
were analyzed fluorometrically in the unfertilized eggs,
trochophores, and veligers of the limpet Acmaea scutum.

were
Glucose-6-phosphate,dehydrogenase activity, constant at
all stages. Hexokinase activity increased almost three-fold
between the trochophore and veliger stage. No maltase,
galactosidase, or amylase activity was found at any stage.
A laminarinase-type enzyme, capable of degrading algal laminarin
to free glucose, was found in all embryonic stages. This
enzyme may be involved in digestion of laminarin when the
embryo becomes a feeding larvae, or may be involved in
intracellular breakdown of 8,1-3 linked glycoproteins during
embryogenesis.-Author.
