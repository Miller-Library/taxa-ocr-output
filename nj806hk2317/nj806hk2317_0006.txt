0.25 umoles TPN, 5 jmoles Ngcla, and 4 jumoles glucose-6-
phosphate (G-6-P).
(2) Hexokinase: Same as (1), except 10 jmoles/mi
glucose were substituted for G-6-P, plus 2 umoles/ mi ATP,
and O.5 ugms/ml CÃ¶PDh.
3) Carbohydrase: Same as (2), plus 2.5 ugms/ ml IK,
and in place of glucose were substituted either maltose
(1 pmole/ml), lactose (1 umole/ml), laminarin or starch
(0.05%, final concentration). Negligible glucose was
present in the starch, laminarin, or cell extract. Ap-
preciable amounts, however, were found in the maltose and
lactose. To eliminate this contribution, the reaction mix
(minus cell extract) was incubated with sufficient substrate
to remove all free glucose, and the reaction then initiated
with cell extract.
(4) Isocitrate dehydrogenase: Same as (1), except
2 umoles/ml isocitric acid was substituted for the G-6-P.
Other assays!
Unfertilized and veliger stages were also assayed
for carbohydrases by measuring reducing sugars released,
using the method of Somogyi as modified by Nelson (1944
As a further check, amylase activity was also measured
qualitatively by adding iodine to samples of extract and
starch at five-minute intervals, and using decolorization
