Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. scaber</span>
Within the Crustacean genus <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Isopoda : Exact'>Isopoda,</span> females of most spe¬
cies brood their young in a ventral marsupium, formed by five
pair of oostegites which cover the first five thoracic segments,
The young emerge as fully developed, miniature adults, except
that they lack the last pair of thoracic legs. Speculations
have been made about the kind and degree of protection offered
by the brood pouch (Verhoeff 1920), but little is actually
known. Young isopods, especially these in the marsupium, can¬
not move from adverse microclimates as readily as adults. They
have a narrower range of tolerance to stress, for example, they
are more susceptible to desication than older individuals, prob-
ably because of their small size (Heeley 1911). Paris (1963)
found heavy mortality among young in the terrestrial species Ar¬
madillidium vulgare as a result of desication. Verhoeff (1920)
suggests that the female is able to regulate the microclimate of
the brood pouch to protect the developing embryos from desica¬
tion. I now report on work indicating that the female has be -
havioral and physiological adaptations which combat environmental
stress to provide for the development of her brood.
The terrestrial isopod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porcellio scaber : Exact'>Porcellio scaber</span> is abundant within
the Monterey Peninsula. I looked for evidence of any difference
in natural distribution among three classes of P. scaber: brood-
ing females, males, and non-brooding females. Three general types
of habitat were sampled: (1) a predominately shaded area, cool and
moist, where isopods were found in the surface duff and under rot¬
Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
ting logs and boards; (2) under rocks of surface contact area
ranging fromm 200 to 800 square centimeters, resting on fine,
silty soil. These rocks were shaded about half the day, and
underneath them the relative humidity ranged from 60 to 80
percent. (3) Isopods were found on moist, decaying humus un¬
der iceplant on slopes exposed to the sun.
The surface temperatures under a roek, board or litter were
measured by slipping a glass-bulb mercury thermometer underneath
and checking the temperature in more than one place. The temper¬
ature varied little with the position of the thermometer. Rela-
tive humidity was measured by slipping cobalt chloride papers un¬
der the rock (Bedford 1955). Following these measurements all
isopods were collected, counted, sexed, and measured. Each rock
or board was treated as a separate sample. In areas where there
were no rocks or boards to deliniate a sample, a 50X50 or 30X30
square centimeter quadrat was used, to insure a sample size of at
least ten animals. Maximum-minimum thermometers were placed at
the sample sites for a period of six to ten days, both cool and
warm, from May 10 to May 25. The mean temperature was calculated
as the average of the maximum and minimum temperatures for all the
days.
The data from these field samples indicated temperature de-
pendant distribution. Since some sample sizes were small brood¬
ing and non-brooding females were grouped. Female P. scaber were
found in significantly greater numbers at mean temperature from
Behavioral and Thysiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
16 - 19' C than at mean temperature from 12'- 15 C (p«.001, stud¬
ent's t-test) (Fig. 1). There was a higher percentage of females
at maximum temperature from 21 - 30 C than at maximum temperature
from 11 - 17 C (p£.010, student's t-test) (Fig. 2). There was a
higher number of females at minimum temperature 13 C than at min¬
imum temperature 11 C (p2.005, student's t-test) (Fig. 3).
To test the hypothesis that female P. scaber seek a different
temperature than male, Lbuilt a temperature gradient apparatus in
which the temperature response of animals of each class could be
tested in individual runways. Its heavy iron base produced a
smooth gradient ranging from 11' C to 30'C over a distance of 65
centimeterd. A strip of wet filter paper was laid down each run¬
way to provide 100 percent humidity. The temperature was measured
at two centimeter intervals along the gradient with a TELE-THERMO-
METER probe. Measuring the temperature across the gradient showed
less than O.5 C variation between different runways. The tempera-
ture gradient changed little during a series of five experiments.
In each experiment the animals were alternated by class. Since
P. scaber are photonegative, the apparatus was covered to elimi¬
nate light induced activity. After 10 minutes the cover was re-
moved and the positions of the isopods were recorded.
The mean temperatures sought by brooding females, non-brooding
females, and males were 20'C, 18°C, and 15.1 C respectively. An
analysis of variance determined that the variation of means was due
to difference in sex, and not to replication of residual errer
Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
(pé.Ol, F-test). There are significant differences between the
mean temperatures sought by males and brooding females (p.001,
student's t-test) and by males and females (pé.Ol, student's
t-test). There is no significant difference between the mean
temperatures sought by brooding and non-brooding females.
This confirms what the field study revealed: that female
P. scaber seek a higher temperature range than male. This may
be a seasonal occurance to insure that brooding females will ex¬
perience temperatures which may be optimal to development of the
embryos.
To investigate the role of temperature in the rate of devel-
opment of the young, I followed the in vivo development of eight-
een broods. I chose and characterized seven stages of develop¬
ment which I could easily identify, counting emergence as stage
"7", and selected eighteen females whose broods ranged through the
first six stages. These brooding females were kept in containers of
moist soil and vegetation, nine at 15°C and nine at 20°C. Every
other day a few embryos were removed from each brood and staged.
This technique required restraining the mother under filtered sea
water in a tray and lifting a brood plate to allow a few embryos to
float out. This method usually did not damage the brood pouch and
the females recovered immediately.
The average rate of development for each brood was calculated
as the number of stages through which it developed, divided by the
number of days it took to reach the last observed stage. The mean
Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
rate of development was the average of the individual rates at each
temperature. The mean rate at 20°C was .16 stages per day, twice
as great as the mean rate at 15°C which was .23 stages per day, a
significant difference (p.0l, student's t-test).
Verhoeff (1920) reported durations of 19, 72, and 102 days in
P. scaber, from the time of the first visible swelling of the brood
pouch until the young emerged. He found that the variation in
brooding duration in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. scaber may</span> br greater than in other species
of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Oniscoidea : Exact'>Oniscoidea.</span> He also noted that the duration of individual stages
was dependant on the weather, however, he did not report temperature
data. At the stage which I called "l", the brood pouch was easily
perceptible. Even allowing for the elapse of several days before
"I", and for the possibility that my manipulations may have initi-
ated early emergence of the young, my brood durations - about 25 to
28 days at 20'C - were shorter than Verhoeff's shortest. The in¬
creased rate of development associated with a warmer microhabitat
is a likely factor in the temperature response shown by female P.
scaber at this time of year. As an advantage, the shorter brooding
duration decreases the length of a period during which the female is
most vulnerable to mechanical injury and parasitism, both noted by
verhoeff (1920). I observed several cases of damaged brood plates
as well as the presence of worms within some brood pouches.
Presumably there is increased desication stress associated with
a warmer microhabitat. That the female seeks warmer temperatures
may indicate that the brood poch envirorment provides a controlled
Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P.scaber
humidity to protect the young. To test the effects of desication
stress on females and their broods, in comparison with males, the
animals were placed in a constant environment of 50 percent humidity
at 23 -25 C. Initially I used fourteen animals from each class and
recorded the time of death for each. Afterward I found that differ-
ences in weight as small as two milligrams could be masking any ef-
fect of the animals sex on its survival time. I selected only the
seven pairs in which the weight difference was less than one milli-
gram. The mean survival time for the group of three brooding and
four non-brooding females was 15.2 hours, siggnificantly longer
than the mean survival time for the seven males, 11.1 hours (pé.Ol1,
student's t-test). There is evidently some sex-related character-
istic which makes it possible for females to resist desication
stress longer than males. I have noticed a general difference
between the shapes of each sex: males tend to be longer and narrow¬
er than females and brooding females of the same weight.
At the time of her death, the brood of each female was still
alive. This is additional evidence that the marsupium is a pro-
tective environment. It is interesting that the mother is sacri-
ficed while the brood is preserved, since the embryos desicate with-
in a few hours if they remain in stress conditions. It seems more
advantageous to the species that the mother sacrifice her brood and
take advantage of the fluid in the marsupium,if she could possibly
live to produce another brood. This may indicate that there is no
link between the internal fluid system of the mother and the brood
pouch fluid.
Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
Summary
Field studies have revealed that female P. scaber seek warmer
temperatures than male. A laboratory experiment which allowed ani-
mals to seek temperatures in a gradient confirmed the field obser¬
vations, yielding mean temperatures of 15.lC and from 18 to 20'C
sought by males and females respectively. The experiment indicated
no difference between the temperature responses of brooding and
non-brooding females; the response does not seem to occur in the
individual with the onset of the brooding period, but appears to
be a characteristic of the sex. The positive response to warmer
temperatures which has been shown by females may be a seasonal oc¬
curance which insures that brooding females will experience temp¬
eratures which may be optimum for embryonic development. It has
been shown that increasing the temperature of the microhabitat from
15 to 20 C did indeed double the rate of embryonic development.
Rate of development clearly may play an important role in the temp¬
erature response. In conjunction with seeking a warmer habitat,
there is some evidence that females are able to withstand the effects
of desication stress for a longer period than males. That the brood
within the marsupium survives a period of desication which has killed
the mother provides striking evidence of the protective qualities of
the brood pouch.
