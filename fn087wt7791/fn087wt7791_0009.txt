Submergence tolerances
The second and third instar larvae of O. glauca were all responsive following submergence for as
long as four days (Figure 7). After six days submergence, 33% of the larvae were unresponsive
following the treatment and were unable to recover. Following eight days of submergence, zero
larvae were responsive immediately following submergence. However, following the three hour
recovery period, 67% were responsive. All larvae were unresponsive following treatments of 10
days or longer and no larvae recovered from these treatments.
Again, pupae of O. glauca appeared more sensitive than the second or third instar larvae.
40% of pupae had eclosed in the 16 days following the 2 hour treatment, compared with 12.5%
eclosion following the 24 hour treatment.
Respirometry
No measurable respiration was found during a six hour period of submergence. The O,
saturation did not differ among control tubes and tubes with larvae. In contrast, after the four
day trial, a significant percentage of O2 was removed from the tubes containing larvae. The
average respiration rate was 0.4317 umol/hr/g.
Barnacle Ã–smolarity
The osmolarity of the barnacle fluid collected from the seven habitats on 31 May 2001 was
significantly greater than that of the seawater samples collected on the same day (Figure 9, t-test.
p50.001).
