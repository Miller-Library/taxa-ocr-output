Discussion
O. glauca, a terrestrial insect, is highly unusual in that it has been able to establish a niche in a
marine environment by having larvae and pupae tolerant of physiological stresses associated
with the intertidal zone. The results of this study suggest that the second and third instar larvae
of O. glauca are more tolerant to these physiological stresses than are the pupae. This difference
is most evident in the thermal tolerance responses of the larvae and pupae. Although larvae
showed significant signs of stress, they were able to tolerate temperatures as high as 38°C. In
contrast, pupae did not eclose following exposure to either 35°C or 38°C. Pupae may take 28
days to eclose (Burger et al. 1980) so the results may not have shown all pupae that would have
eventually eclosed (age of pupae used in the study was unknown). However, many pupae did
eclose (40%) in the 2hr submergence treatment, indicating the lack of eclosion was a real effect,
It is possible that the rapid development within the pupae leading up to eclosion makes the pupae
more susceptible to thermal stress.
Pupae were most abundant in the crevice habitat that also had the longest exposure to
temperatures that appear lethal to a pupa in the laboratory. It appears that on these warm days,
the larvae are also living in a hypersaline barnacle, perhaps due to evaporative cooling by the
barnacle. However, the temperatures recorded by the datalogger may not be indicative of the
internal barnacle temperature in the high crevice. The thermocouple on the datalogger may have
been too close to the rock and may not have accurately recorded the ambient temperature. In
addition, a different datalogger model was required for the narrow crevice, and this smaller
instrument may have had different thermal properties than the other four dataloggers. If this is
not the case, it is unclear how the pupae deal with these elevated temperatures in the field,
