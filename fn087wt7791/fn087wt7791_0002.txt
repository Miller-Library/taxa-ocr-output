Introduction
The rocky intertidal zone experiences large temperature fluctuations and extended periods of
submergence. This environment is extremely stressful for a terrestial insect, and may explain
why insects rarely inhabit and reproduce in the intertidal zone. One little studied terrestial insect
that occupies this niche is the intertidal fly, Oedoparena glauca. It is the first and only
confirmed record of a dipterous predator of barnacles (Burger et. al 1980). O. glauca larvae prey
on the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula. O. glauca larval development consists of three instars
(Burger et. al 1980). This report focuses on the second and third larval stages and the pupae
(Figures 11 and 12). The adult flies are 5-Omm in length (Figure 10), and feed primarily on
diatoms. O. glauca inhabits the Endocladia-Balanus zone within the intertidal zone.
There are only two other reports of Diptera associated with barnacles, both from Europe.
Roubond (1903) found fly larvae among the Semibalanus balanoides. Mercier (1921) observed
larvae living within barnacles, and hypothesized that these larvae were also predaceous on
barnacles. Neither account reared larvae to adults, so the identification of the species was not
certain.
There are many unusual stresses that the O. glauca must overcome to survive in intertidal
habitats. Glynn (1965) determined that the center of the Endocladia-Balanus zone may spend
27% percent of the time submerged. For a terrestial insect, this is a tremendous amount of time
to be submerged in saline water. Furthermore, temperature may fluctuate a great deal in the
intertidal zone, and change rapidly depending on the tide. Since the adult cannot tolerate
submergence, O. glauca must coordinate behavior such as oviposition with periods of low tide
emersion.
