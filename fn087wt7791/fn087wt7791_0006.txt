Submergence tolerance
To test submergence tolerance of the second and third instar larvae, larvae were placed into 2 mL
screw top glass vials that were filled with a solution of filtered seawater and antibiotics (15 mg/L
penicillin-G and 15 mg/L streptomycin). A single larva was placed within each of three vials per
treatment. The vials were submerged in a 13°C water bath and maintained up to (but not
submerging) the level of the bottom of the air-permeable screw top. Larvae were submerged in
﻿6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 264 hour treatments. Following submergence, the larvae
were allowed to recover for three hours. During the three hour recovery period, the larvae were
placed inside petri dishes and maintained at 15°C, as described above. As before, responsiveness
to stimuli was scored immediately following the treatment and following the recovery period.
Pupae were subjected to a similar esperiment. Pupae were placed into plastic and nylon
mesh tea strainers (PermaBrew Tea Infuser, Upton Tea Imports, Hopkinton, MA). A large
beaker was filled with the solution of filtered seawater and antibiotics (see above), and the tea
strainers were submerged at 13°C for either 2 hours or 24 hours (n = 8-10 pupae per treatment).
Following the submergence treatment, the pupae were placed inside petri dishes at 15°C and
percent eclosion was quantified after 16 days.
Respirometry
These respirometry trials were designed to test if the larvae were respiring during short and long
submergence periods. A water-jacketed microrespiration chamber was attached to a water bath
and maintained at 13°C. Data were recorded using PowerLab (model 8SP, ADInstruments,
Mountain View, CA) and the PowerLab Chart Program. Filtered seawater treated with
antibiotics (15 mg/L penicillin-G and 15 mg/L streptomycin) was aerated with an air pump prior
