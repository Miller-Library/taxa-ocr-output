because they were unable to do so in the lab. It is also uncertain why these sites with high
temperature exposure are chosen by the reproductive female.
When submerged, larvae of O. glauca do not appear to respire initially, but do respire
with extended submergence. It is unclear whether the onset of respiration is delayed, or whether
the initial respiration was too small to be detected above the noise of the system. The
mechanism by which respiration occurs during submergence is unknown in these larvae. Further
work is needed to elucidate how these larvae respire in both air and water.
With larvae and pupae of O. glauca able to tolerate long durations of submergence, one
might predict that high numbers of these individuals would be found in the low zone. This
seems even more likely based on the sensitivity of larvae and pupae to periods of thermal stress,
which are generally more severe at higher tidal heights. However, although there appears to be a
preference for northern exposure over southern exposure, both low habitats showed zero
infestation by O. glauca. Newly hatched O. glauca flies may require time to harden their wings.
to become competent to fly. This phase of their maturation may be difficult in the low zone due
to shorter periods of aerial exposure. Furthermore, pupae are more sensitive to submergence,
making distribution higher in the intertidal zone favorable. These facts seem consistent with
Burger et al.â€™s (1980) observation that pupae in WA state were distributed higher in the intertidal
zone than the larvae. Pupal distribution may also be decreased in the low zone due to decreased
barnacle density, resulting in a less attractive target for ovipositing females.
The southern geographical limit of O. glauca is reported to be in Central California
(Burger et al. 1980). This boundary could arise from the pupae living near their lethal limit,
especially on unseasonably warm days. This southern geographical limit may be established by
