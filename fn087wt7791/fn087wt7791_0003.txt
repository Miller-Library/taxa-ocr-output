1 quantified the physiological tolerances of the second and third instar larvae and pupae.
Although the mechanisms for the tolerance of much of the physiological stress is unknown, it is
clear that the larvae are capable of withstanding severe stress. The pupae appear much more
sensitive to thermal stress and submergence than the larvae. These tolerances may have
important effects on both the local and geographical distribution of this species.
Materials and methods
Organisms
Pupae and second and third instar larvae of Oedoparena glauca were collected from high
intertidal crevice habitats around a surge channel on the wave exposed point at Hopkins Marine
Station in Central California (Figure 13). This channel contains many wave-force meters
installed by Mark Denny and his lab group. Collected larvae and pupae were placed in petri
dishes with raised lids. A small opening was kept in the Parafilm sealing the petri dishes to
prevent anoxia. The larvae and pupae were kept moist and held in air at approximately 15Â°C
above a flowing seawater tank. During the treatments of the larvae, the larvae were not fed. Wet
masses of second and third instars were between 0.0020g and 0.0170g. Wet weights of the
pupae were approximately 0.0150g.
Spatial distribution
The abundances of larvae and pupae were surveyed in seven habitats around the wave-exposed
surge channel. These seven habitats were located in a high intertidal crevice and on north and
south-facing walls at low, mid, and high tidal heights. The tidal heights were obtained by
surveying the middle of these zones (Table 1). From these seven habitats, 100-150 acorn
