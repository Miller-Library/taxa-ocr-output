Figure 1. Infestation of barnacles (B. glandula) in the seven intertidal habitats: a high crevice,
low, mid, and high tidal heights on north and south-facing walls.
Figure 2. Datalogger temperatures for 30 May 2001 through 1 June 2001 in the high zone
crevice, and low and high zones on north and south-facing intertidal walls at the Hopkins Marine
Life Refuge.
Figure 3. Temperatures for 31 May 2001, the day with the highest peak temperatures for the
period 30 May 2001 thru 1 June 2001.
Figure 4. Calibration curve for datalogger temperatures versus the measured internal
temperatures of barnacles (B. glandula) within 10 cm of the south-facing high zone datalogger.
Figure 5. Time of exposure in the high zone crevice, low and high zones of north and south-
facing walls to temperatures above 30°C, 33°C, and 35°C for the period 30 May 2001 through 1
June 2001.
Figure 6. Thermal tolerance of O. glauca larvae. Percentages of larvae responsive immediately
after temperature treatment (dotted line), and final survival after a three hour recovery period
(solid line) (n = 3-9 larvae per termperature)
Figure 7. Submergence tolerance of O. glauca larvae. Percentages of larvae responsive
immediately after submergence treatment (dotted line), and final survival after a three hour
recovery period (solid line) (n = 3 larvae per submergence treatment).
Figure 8. Percentage of pupae eclosed after 16 days following submergence treatments of 24
hours and 2 hours (n = 8-10 pupae per treatment).

standard errors of the mean.
