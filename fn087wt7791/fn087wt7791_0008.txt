Barnacle field temperatures
The dataloggers recorded temperatures above 35°C in the south-facing low and high habitats as
well as in the crevice habitat (Figures 2 and 5). The maximum recorded temperatures occurred
on 31 May 2001 (Figure 3). Highly stressful temperatures, above 35°C, were recorded by the
dataloggers only in the south-facing and the high crevice habitats. A tight correlation was found
between datalogger readings and the internal temperatures of nearby barnacles (Figure 4, R2 =
0.7576), indicating that the datalogger records were representative of the temperatures that larvae
of O. glauca would experience within these habitats.
Thermal tolerances
O. glauca's lethal thermal limits were 38-39°C, with zero larvae responding to stimulus
immediately following the 38°C treatment, and 67% responding following the three hour
recovery period (Figure 6). All larvae subjected to treatments 2 39°C were unresponsive
immediately following the treatments, and none recovered. Temperatures of 36°C also seemed
stressful to the larvae; although all larvae were able to recover, 66% were unresponsive
immediately following exposure to 36°C
The pupae of O. glauca seemed more sensitive than the second and third instar larvae.
No pupae had eclosed in the 16 days following the three treatments (35°, 38°, 41°C). Although
larvae were able to tolerate temperatures as high as 38°C, the pupae appeared unable to
withstand the 35°C treatment.
