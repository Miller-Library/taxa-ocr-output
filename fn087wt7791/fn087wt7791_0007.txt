to setting 100% 02 saturation. Six gas-tight test tubes (-3 mL volume) were then filled with the
treated seawater. In the six hour trial, four of the six tubes had two larvae placed in each and two
tubes were used as controls. In the four day trial, three of the tubes had two larvae in each and
three tubes were used as controls. All tubes were maintained in the dark at 13°C. At the end of
the treatments, samples of water from each tube were injected into the microrespirometry unit
and percent O2 saturation was quantified.
Barnacle Osmolarity
On 31 May 2001, two B. glandula in each habitat were sampled near the time when they were
likely experiencing their maximum daily temperatures for that day. Immediately following
removal from the rock, internal fluid was extracted from the barnacle using a 1 mL syringe and
20G1 PrecisionGlide needles. As a control, a sample of untreated seawater was also collected in
the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. The barnacle fluid and seawater were analyzed in a Wescor
5500 Vapor Pressure Ösmometer. Differences in osmolarity among the fluid samples and the
seawater were analyzed using a t-test.
Results
Spatial distribution
The highest infestation of O. glauca larvae and pupae was in barnacles of the high zone crevice
(Figure 1). Infestation was moderate (2.7%) in the north-facing high habitat and in the north-
facing mid-habitat (3.8%). There was no infestation in any of the south-facing habitats and zero
infestation in the low north-facing habitat.
