Abstract 1 quantified the spatial distribution, physiological tolerances, and respiration rates of
larvae of the intertidal fly, Oedoparena glauca. O. glauca larvae consume the barnacle, Balanus
glandula, and use the shell for protection and pupation. The percent of barnacles infested with
larvae and pupae was greatest in a high-intertidal crevice (29%), moderate on upper north-facing
intertidal walls (-3%), and zero at lower tidal heights and on south-facing walls. Thermal stress,
high salinity, and submergence are physiological stresses imposed on the larvae and pupae due to
life in the intertidal zone. In laboratory tests of thermal tolerance, all larvae died following 3
hours of exposure to 39°C, but tolerated temperatures 838°C. Pupae appeared more sensitive to
thermal stress, with 0% eclosion by pupae treated at 35°C, 38°C, and 41°C for four hours.
Intertidal datalogger records and field measurements of internal B. glandula temperatures
exceeded 36°C, near the thermal limit of O. glauca larvae. In addition to this thermal stress,
during periods of aerial exposure, B. glandula was significantly more saline in vivo than the
surrounding seawater, perhaps due to evaporative cooling by the barnacle. In tests of
submergence tolerance, larvae survived 8 days of submergence in filtered seawater held at 13°C.
but all died after 10 days. The pupae were apparently more sensitive to submergence; 40% of
pupae submerged for two hours eclosed within 16 days, whereas there was only 12.5% eclosion
of pupae submerged for 24 hours. The larvae were observed not to respire during six hours of
submergence. However, the larvae respired at a rate of 0.4317 umol Oy/hr/g, over four days of
submergence. This study illustrates that O. glauca larvae are hardy and capable of tolerating
thermal stress and submergence. In contrast, the pupae may be more sensitive to these
environmental conditions, perhaps restricting their geographical distribution.
