barnacles, Balanus glandula, were haphazardly removed from the rock with a screwdriver. To
determine percent infestation by Oedoparena glauca larvae and pupae within these habitats, the
barnacle body was removed from each B. glandula and the contents of each barnacle shell were
scrutinized in the laboratory.
Temperature loggers
Temperature dataloggers (Optic StowAway, Onset Computer Corp., Pocasset, MA) were
installed in the high and low, north and south-facing habitats from 28 May 2001 thru 1 June
2001. A smaller temperature datalogger (Tidbit, Onset Computer Corp.) was placed in the high
crevice for the same period. All of the dataloggers were set to record the ambient temperature
every ten minutes.
Barnacle Temperatures
Barnacle temperatures were taken periodically in the field from 30 May 2001 through 1 June
2001. The internal temperature of the barnacle was taken by opening the opercular plates with a
scalpel and inserting a thermocouple inside the shell. Ten barnacle temperatures were taken at
each site during each sampling. Barnacle temperatures were also taken periodically in a 10 cm
radius around one temperature datalogger to test whether barnacle temperatures were correlated
with datalogger records
Thermal tolerance
A 1.8 m long aluminum block was used to establish a thermal gradient to test the tolerances of
the larvae and pupae. On one side of the aluminum block, a heater was attached, and on the
