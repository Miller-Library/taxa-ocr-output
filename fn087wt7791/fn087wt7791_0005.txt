other side a water bath. The temperature set points were manipulated until a preferred thermal
gradient was maintained. The aluminum block was drilled with holes, four across and 31
lengthwise, so that 2.0 mL Polypropylene flat top microcentrifuge tubes could be inserted within
the aluminum block. The microcentrifuge tubes were punctured on the cap to prevent anoxia.
The upper thirds of the tubes were filled with tightly fitting foam cores that had been soaked in a
solution of filtered seawater and antibiotics (15 mg/L penicillin-G and 15 mg/L streptomycin).
Three thermal tolerance experiments were performed on the second and third instar
larvae. Five different temperatures were chosen per experiment. The first of three experiments
had temperatures of 24°C, 28°C, 32°C, 36°C, and 40°C. The second had temperatures of 32°C.
33°C, 34°C, 35°C, and 36°C. In the final experiment, larvae were maintained at temperatures of
36°0, 37°C, 38°C, 39°C, and 40°C. A control tube with moistened foam was placed in the
fourth hole at each experimental temperature along the block. A thermocouple was inserted
through a hole in the top of these tubes, and the temperatures were monitored to assure stable
conditions during the experiment. Larvae were exposed to experimental temperatures for three
hours, followed by a three hour recovery period. During the recovery period, the larvae were
placed into petri dishes covered with Parafilm through which a small hole had been made and
held at 15°C above the seawater tank. Responsiveness to stimuli immediately following the
treatment and following the recovery period were scored.
In a similar experiment, pupae in microcentrifuge tubes with seawater moistened foam
cores (see above) were exposed to 35°C, 38°C, or 41°C for four hours (n = 3 pupae x 3 tubes per
temperature). Following the period of exposure, pupae were placed in petri dishes with raised
lids and held at 15°C above the flow tank. Percent eclosion was scored after 16 days.
