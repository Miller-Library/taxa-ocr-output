ABSTRACT
The gastropod mollusc gastropod Strombus luhuanus, prey to some Conus snails,
exhibits a morphologically unique extendable foot utilized for fast escape response. The
pedal ganglion of specimens was identified using in situ stimulation of radiating axon
bundles and observing pedal response. Once the two lobes were removed, neurons were
dissociated using glass teasing needles and studied under whole-cell patch clamp.
Outward potassium currents were observed to have complex activation kinetics and
biphasic inactivation. These kinetics were characterized and used to develop a pre-pulse
protocol for current separation. Two distinct voltage-gated potassium currents were
identified and isolated using this pre-pulse procedure. The fast activating and
inactivating current resembled a classic A-current and could reach peak current within 2
milliseconds after pulse initiation for large depolarizations, and inactivated completely in
about 30 ms. The second component of potassium current resembled a delayed rectifier
and exhibited slow and incomplete inactivation, with peak current occurring within 5 or 6
milliseconds for large depolarizations and partial inactivation over the much longer
period of about 150 milliseconds. The kinetic properties of each individual current were
analyzed and described and a model based on Hodgkin-Huxley was used to compute
conductance time course as a function of voltage.
