where A is the surface area of the cell. The Variing term in this equation refers to the
driving force, which is equal to the command voltage minus the reversal potential, which
was estimated using tail current readings (data not shown). Eq. 1 was applied to each of
the traces for lgand Iks. While this equation gives more accurate traces than
compensation accomplished through offsetting the membrane command voltage by Ipeak
Rseres for each step, the fraction within the denominator tends to amplify noise for small
currents and small driving voltages. Therefore the traces from stimuli that elicited no
discernable increases in conductance were removed from the each series. The
calculations were also made without series resistance compensation to assess its
significance. As shown in Fig. 9, for large depolarizations there is a significant offset due
to series resistance. Fig. 10 shows the final, compensated conductance traces as
calculated for both Igr and Iks.
Characterization of Ixt
The procedure used for estimating the various parameters utilizes two
simultaneous approaches to the same values. First, approximations of the values are
made by fitting single exponentials to specific regions of curves for large depolarizations,
(to be explained in more detail later). These values are then used as the initial guesses for
parameterized functions that are then fit iteratively using a computer program
(NEURON, developed by Michael Hines and John W. Moore at the Department of
Neurobiology, Duke University). Because the empirical approximations are only
