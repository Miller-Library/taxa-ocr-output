their respective non-pre-pulse counterparts (which contain both currents). Igris thus pre-
pulse sensitive and Ig, is pre-pulse resistant. The technique was applied to a series of
such traces at varying stimulus amplitudes to yield the individual currents plotted in Fig.
ï»¿6. Fig. 7 shows current-voltage plots for these currents.
Conversion to conductance and correction for series resistance
To complete Hodgkin-Huxley-like characterization of the two currents displayed
in Fig. 6 these traces must be converted into units of conductance (siemens) and
normalized by the size of the cell. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the fitting procedure
necessitates compensation any significant residual series resistance of the electrode tip.
Series resistance was calculated from the capacitance transients of a-10 mV step
made with fast (electrode) capacitance balanced, slow-capacitance compensation turned
off, and series resistance compensation set to the same level used to record currents. A
sample pulse is shown in Fig. 8. The exponential decay is fit, giving a time constant
equal to Rsenes times the total membrane capacitance of the cell. Cell capacitance is
calculated from the time-integral of the transient current, and the time constant (tap) is
divided by this number to give the estimate of Rses. The membrane capacitance is also
used to approximate the surface area of the cell, under the assumption that the membrane
capacitance per area is near 1 uF per cm (Hille 1992). Values of these parameters for
each of the three cells studies are listed in Table 1
The combination of these parameters shown in Eq. 1 yields the conductance per
square centimeter of the cell, including compensation for series resistance:
