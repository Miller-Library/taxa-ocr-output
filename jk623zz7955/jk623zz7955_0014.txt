recovery from inactivation is also dependent on negative voltages (Fig. 15). It is likely
that the level of Iginactivation plays a major role in establishing the threshold stimulus
required to create an action potential. Activation of Igrduring an action potential would
lead to rapid and probably incomplete inactivation, and a string of rapidly occurring
action potentials would thus produce a progressive increase in excitability as larger
portions of A-current were inactivated.
This mechanism is just one example of the sort of information processing
available to a neuron that possesses multiple current types, and it is the generally
accepted means by which A-current modulates frequency output to graded stimuli
intensity. Useful speculation towards the physiological purposes of the many other
variations is premature for a paper of this scope and the current level of research.
The rate constants for the two currents are plotted in Fig. 16. Both currents show
little rise in ÃŸ at the most negative voltages studied, which in the case of the Igg is result
of the 11" order activating term required in fitting its conductance curves. Whether this
is artifact or truth will require further study (similarly for the relatively constant value of
no).
Future studies will include complete characterization of the steady-state
inactivation kinetics for Igs, as well more description of the other parameters for relevant
voltage ranges outside those studied thus far. With sufficient data, it should be possible
to fit continuous functions the graphs of the rate constants, which can then be used to
calculate and predict action potentials across the membrane. These topics all serve as
avenues for further study in the description of the Strombus pedal-ganglion currents.
