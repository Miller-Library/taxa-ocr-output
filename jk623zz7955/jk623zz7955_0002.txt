INTRODUCTION
The development of the voltage-clamp technique (Cole, 1949; Hodgkin, Huxley
and Katz, 1949 and 1952) allowed measurement and description of the various currents
due to voltage-gated ion channels in a neuronal membrane. Studies of the properties of
excitable membranes have led to the identification of many ion channels controlled by
several mechanisms, but voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels form the
backbone of excitation and action-potential propagation (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952)
Many different current types arise from these various channels within the
membranes of neurons, some sharing similar enough characteristics to be classified into
subgroups. "Transient inward" currents are those usually involved in the rising phase of
an action potential, and are carried predominantly by sodium ions. "Delayed rectifier
has been used to describe the repolarizing potassium currents involved in the falling
phase of the action potential. Another porassium current type, deemed "A-current" by its
original describers (Conner and Stevens, 1971a-c), plays a unique role that may not be
directly involved in the falling phase of the action potential. A-type currents have the
general form of an outward potassium current that activates at quite negative voltages and
inactivates rapidly and completely, also at fairly negative voltages.
The physiological significance of this category of current is not entirely agreed
upon within the literature-perhaps mostly due to the large number of transient outward
currents that have been given its title or the current lack of an identified molecular
subtype. However there is general consensus that A-currents allow stimulus-intensity
encoding through frequency modulation (Hille, 1992). Membranes lacking such currents
generally respond to a steady stimulus with high, constant frequency of firing or a single
