Fig. 1: Current traces showing the complicated activation and inactivation kinetics
described within the text. Notice the delayed peaks at intermediate voltages.
Fig. 2: 250 ms pulses from the holding potential of-80 mV to +20 mV in 10 mV
increments. These traces show biphasic inactivation.
Fig. 3:
Semi-logarithmic plot of the biphasic inactivating current from a 250 ms pulse
from-80 mV to +20 mV. The smooth line is a fit for the slow-phase
exponential, and the inset depicts the residual fast-inactivating current.
Fig. 4:
Twin-pulse traces displaying the voltage and temporal dependencies of recovery
from inactivation.
Fig. 5: Example current separation using trace-subtraction. The top trace is the current
measured from a step from the holding potential of-80 mV to +60 mV. The
middle trace is the same test pulse with a pre pulse of 55 mV.
Traces showing the currents measured from a sequence of pulses with no pre

pulse (A); with a 55 mV pre pulse (to-25 mV command voltage)(B); and the
isolated fast-inactivating current (C), calculated using trace subtraction.
Fig. 7: IV curves for the currents shown in Fig. 6.
