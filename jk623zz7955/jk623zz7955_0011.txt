g'ky and t, were estimated by fitting the top third of the activation curve (to peak)
with a single exponential of the form:
KO +Klexp(-K2*1)
(9)
KO was used as the estimate for g'gyand 1/K2 was used to approximate ty. The same
exponential was used to fit the inactivation phase of the conductance curve, using 1/K2 to
estimate ti. Once initial guesses were made, each subsequent step used the previous
steps fit values for its guesses, and the final set of curves thus fit are depicted in Fig. 12.
The values for the parameters and the calculated rate constants are listed in Table 2.
Because the gkV curve (Fig. 11) indicates that the saturation point was never reached, an
arbitrary adjustment of 20% was added to the highest conductance to approximate gre,
(a conservative approximation that will have to stand until future experiments can assess
its validity). As would be expected by the complete lack of inactivation recovery in Fig.
4C, ap is 0 for all pulses analyzed.
Characterization of Iks
The model for Ig, currents is similar to Igg however it varies slightly in applicable
assumptions. The most important of these pertains to ha. For Ig, it was assumed that
inactivation was complete for all command voltages studied, yet this assumption is not
necessarily correct for Iks. The long pulses depicted in Fig. 2 show incomplete
inactivation for large depolarizations, a fact that not only invalidates the total inactivation
assumption, but creates other complications as well. It is possible that Ig, is comprised of
