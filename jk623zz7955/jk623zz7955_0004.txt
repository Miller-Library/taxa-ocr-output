light microscope using magnifications from 6x to 50x. The ganglia of the Strombus
encircle the esophagus and were located with incisions near the base of the eye stalks.
The twisted nature of the snail makes direct identification of the pedal ganglion difficult,
however it is distinguishable by having only two fused lobes and a large number of
nerves radiating into the foot musculature. The other ganglion complex has two primary
lobes, each with a smaller auxiliary lobe attached. Functional identification of the pedal
ganglion was accomplished during each dissection using direct stimulus of the radiating
motor nerves and observation of subsequent contractions of the foot.
Once removed, the pedal ganglion from each organism was placed in LIS-based
medium that had been osmotically balanced to seawater and mixed with antibiotics,
(Gilly et al., 1990)
Dissociation
Dissected ganglia were treated for 45 minutes in filtered seawater containing 7 mg
of bacterial protease type XIV per mL, and desheathed using sharp forceps and a razor-
blade knife. Under 50x magnification round neurons were distinguishable in desheathed
areas, and were subsequently teased onto glass cover slips coated with Con A, following
procedures previously described (Gilly et al. 1990). The teasing procedure used glass
micro-pipettes made from type 7052 glass. After dissociation, the cover slips with cells
were left undisturbed for 45 minutes or longer without motion to allow the neurons to
adhere. Cells were then incubated overnight at 12 Â°C to allow recovery, (most neurons
appear swollen immediately after dissociation.) The bathing medium was replaced every
