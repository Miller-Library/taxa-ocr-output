The traces in Fig. 1OB show near complete inactivation for all pulse amplitudes, thus he
can be neglected. Furthermore, pulses from holding potentials more negative than -80
mV (data not shown) did not produce an appreciable decrease in peak current amplitude
for large depolarizations, indicating that ho is at a steady level, and can be assumed to
equal 1. The gxV curve for Ig(Fig. 11) shows no conductance at the holding potential,
so no equals 0. These simplifications lead the following relation when Eq.'s (3) and (4)
are substituted back into the equation for fast conductance (gr, Eq. (2):
8y - 8 y 1- exp(-1/1,) exp(1/1.)

This equation was used in the computational fitting of the conductance curves.
and the parameters g'kt tn, and ti were approximated and used for the initial guess; N
was determined to be 11, the lowest number for which the lag in the activation kinetics
was fit to a reasonable level (by eye only). The large value for N is necessitated by the
long lag after stimulus initiation before the beginning of the rising activation phase. As
all known voltage-gated potassium channels are probably tetramers, the Hodgkin-Huxley
model begins to show its weaknesses here. However, as it is applied in this paper, it
serves to dissect and characterize many parameters of a given current type, making it an
excellent tool for fingerprinting and comparing different currents, regardless of the
underlying structural accuracy of the model.
