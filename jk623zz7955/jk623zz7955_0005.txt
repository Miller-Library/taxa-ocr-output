other day as the cell stock was used, and most cells would not produce reliable seals after
one week post-dissection.
Patch-Clamp
Whole-cell, voltage clamp recordings were carried out at 20 Â°C as described in
detail elsewhere (Gilly and Brismar, 1989). The largest cells were selected for recording.
as they often expressed more sodium current and were consequently the putative motor
neurons. The internal solution (electrode) contained 20 KCl, 305 K-glutamate, 50 KF,
180 glycine, 115 sucrose, 1 EFTA, I EDTA, 10 lysine, 10 Hepes, with a pH of 7.8. The
external (bathing) solution contained 470 tetra-methyl ammonium (TMA), 10 KCl, 10
Cachz, 20 MgCl, 20 MgSO4, 10 Hepes, also with a pH of 7.8.
RESULTS
General observations
Preliminary experiments were carried out to examine the potassium currents in
the isolated neurons of the Strombus pedal ganglion. A series of voltage steps from the
holding potential of-80 mV (Fig. 1.) showed currents with little or no inactivation at
small depolarizations, complicated activation kinetics at intermediate depolarizations
(e.g. late peaks, arrows in Fig. 1), and fast inactivation at large depolarizations. These
current characteristics were found in a sample of three cells, and suggest the presence of
multiple current types.
A set of long pulses revealed biphasic inactivation kinetics (Fig. 2), further
suggesting the possibility of two or more current types. The inactivating currents were
