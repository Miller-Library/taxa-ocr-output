plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale to better highlight the slow and fast exponential
decays. Fig. 3 depicts such a plot for a step from the holding potential of-80 mV to +20
mV. The main plot shows the two components and a fit to the slow component of
inactivation; the inset outlines the residual fast component.
Current separation
The relative time scales of the fast and slow inactivating components (henceforth
referred to as Igand Iks) allowed the possibility that a pre-pulse protocol might serve two
separate the two current types by selectively inactivating Ig without affecting Ig, to an
appreciable extent. A series of twin pulses were run with different recovery intervals
anat several voltages to test this possibility, and to describe recovery from inactivation for
Ifast.
Fig. 4A through C depict the current measurements for a series of twin-pulse
experiments in which all interval durations were varied identically at each of three
recovery voltages (see pulse pattern in Fig 4D). These data describe the time course of
recovery from inactivation and its voltage dependence, showing total inactivation in some
of the traces. Examination of the dependence of total inactivation revealed that pulses to
-25 mV were sufficient to totally inactivate Igg (data not shown).
The information outlined above was used to construct a pre-pulse procedure that
would selectively remove the fast inactivating current before test pulses. This technique
yielded current traces like those shown in Fig. 5, which depicts the currents from two
stimulation regimes, one with a pre pulse to-25 mV and one without. Test pulses with a
pre pulse contain only Igs, allowing Igrto be isolated by subtracting these traces t from
