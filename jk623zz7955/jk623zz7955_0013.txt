3, in which the values for t, are shown to vary significantly between the two assumptions.
This sensitivity increases with smaller pulses to the point that a variation of twenty
percent in estimates of ha can cause an order of magnitude difference in ty. In contrast,
the variation of the activation parameters (g'k and t,) is minimal. This insensitivity
allowed analysis of the activation kinetics of Ik, for comparison with those of Igr The
difficulty in approximating a changing ho necessitated the use the full-inactivation
assumption (ha equals 0).
The same procedure described for Igrwas used to fit and calculate the parameters
for Ix, the one difference being the use of Eq.'s (10) and (11) in place of (7) and (8). The
results of these calculations are summarized in Table 4. (For completeness, the table
includes values for the inactivation kinetics as calculated under the assumption of full-
inactivation.)
DISCUSSION
The grV curves (Fig. 11) for the two currents characterized in this study are
consistent with two distinct potassium channel types; they display different steepness as
depolarization levels increase. This voltage-dependence provides a means for
information integration, one of many that these two currents provide. Any relative
variation in a parameter between Igrand Igs, with respect to voltage or time, is a possible
mechanism for information integration.
The relation between the t,'s shown in Fig. 14B outlines the possible mechanism
by which the A-type Igcurrent can modulate frequency response for graded stimuli. The
time constant of activation for Igris much faster than that for Ig, at negative voltages, and
