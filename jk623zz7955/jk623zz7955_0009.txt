reasonably valid for large depolarizations, they are only used as initial guesses to fit the
largest command step, after which the fit values for the previous step are used as guesses
for the next smaller step. The equation used for fitting the conductance traces is a
variation on the equations used in Hodgkin and Huxley's original 1952 paper, the
primary difference being that the potassium model has an inactivating particle similar to
sodium channels. The equations for the Igemodel are thus:
gy -nhg,

n-n.-(n.-n)exp(-1/.),

h-h.-(h.-ho)exp(-1/7,),
