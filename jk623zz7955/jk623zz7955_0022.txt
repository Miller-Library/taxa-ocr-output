Fig. 8: This figure depicts the initial capacitance transient measured for a-10 mV step.
Fig. 9: Two sets of conductance-per-area curves, calculated from the same current
measurements of Ik, using Eq. (1), the solid line included the Rseries term, the
dotted line did not. This shows the significance of the series resistance.
Fig. 10: Calculated conductance curves for Ik. (A) and IkT(B).
Fig. 11: Relative grV curves for Iks and Igg each scaled independently.
Fig. 12: Changes in conductance for Igrin response to various depolarizations (command
voltages are listed by each trace). The smooth curves were calculated from fits
using Eq. (7), with the resulting parameters described in Table 2.
Fig. 13: Traces showing an enlarged fitting of the conductance changes of Ik, in
response to three different depolarizations. The smooth curves represent the fits
calculated using the assumption of total and partial inactivation, and show the
accuracy with which the fit is achieved regardless of the assumption used, as
well as the insensitivity of the activation phase to the assumption choice.
