spike followed by constant hyperpolarization. With A-current channels, membranes can
respond to stimuli of varying intensity and encode this information in a graded frequency
response.
More current types than those described here exist (Lancaster and Pennefather,
1986), and many studies have sought to describe the physiological purposes of each.
After Conner and Stevens work, a paper by Stephen Smith (1978) showed the role of A¬
current in the bursting nature of neurons in Tritonia diomedia.
The currents in neurons of the gastropod mollusc Strombus luhuanus have not
been previously described, and unique and rapid escape response displayed by this snail
formed the basis for the present work. Strombus uses a large muscular foot to jump away
from possible danger, a very unusual and fast behaviour, atypical of slow-moving
gastropods. Most organsisms, such as the squid, (a cephalopod mollusc), make use of
high conduction speed to initiate and coordinate fast escape responses, and the ion
channels underlying activity in the relevant neurons appear to have fast kinetics (Gilly et
al., 1997). The present description of the potassium currents within neurons from the
Strombus pedal ganglion leads to the identification of two current types. One is a delayed
rectifier with slow inactivation, the other an A-type current with fast and complete
inactivation qualities.
METHODS
Preparation
Strombus snails were obtained from American Samoa and maintained in
oxygenated tanks at room temperature (about 24 °C). Dissection was carried out under
