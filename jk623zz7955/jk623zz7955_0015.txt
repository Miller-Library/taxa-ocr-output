ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Matt Brock, for his technical and academic advice and endless patience for inexperienced
inquiry.
Joseph Schultz for his constant suggestionsâ€”often solving problems before they occur
and answering questions before they are asked.
Professor Stuart H. Thompson for his many insights and conversations on all subjects of
neurobiology.
And a special thanks to Professor William F. Gilly, for all of his support and late hours of
help and encouragement. His high standards are often a cloaked blessing, but a
blessing nonetheless.
