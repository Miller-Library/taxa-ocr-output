two currents, one that inactivates slowly and one that does not inactivate at all. Even
assuming that it is only one current type, the long pulses in Fig. 2 are taken from a
different cell than the properly isolated currents in Fig. 10, and it may be that incomplete
inactivation is not a constant characteristic in all the cells studied. While every cell
studied displayed the complicated activation and inactivation kinetics identifying two
current types, the specific questions raised here require further research to be
appropriately addressed.
In light of these confounding factors, a study and analysis of the inactivation
characteristics of Ig, will be reserved until such a time that proper experiments have been
completed. However, the activation parameters did not show a high degree of sensitivity
to the assumptions necessitated by insufficient inactivation data. Fig. 13 shows curves
for three large depolarizations, fit by the following equation:

8k - 8'k 1-exp(-1/1.)I.-(h. -D)exp(1/1,)
where

8'k.- 8.7
The curves calculated assuming total inactivation (ha equals 0), and those
calculated assuming approximately two-thirds inactivation (an approximation obtained
from KO/(KO +Kl) of an exponential fit of the inactivating current, Eq. (9)), are
superimposed over the original traces. The fit (in terms of mean-squared-error) is slightly
better for the total-inactivation assumption than for partial, but this difference is minimal
and barely discernable by eye. The difference between these curves is outlined in Table
