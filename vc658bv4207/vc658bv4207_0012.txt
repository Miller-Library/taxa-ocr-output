VI. DISCUSSION
The form of the trophozoite and the presumed spore and
the apparent life-cycle plâce the coelomic type in the tribe acephalina
(Kölliker) of the suborder eugregarinida (Doflein). The determination
of famill rests on interpretation of the spore structure; the spores are
either biconical (monocystidae (Butschli))or rhynchocystidae (Bhatia))
or navicular (Urosporidae (Woodcock)). It is clear that some
criteria other than morphology must be established to clarify the
taxonomy of the order gregarinida.
A more efficient mode than spawning of the host for spore
dispersal must be sought. It must be firmly established that mature
spores can be digested by the host, or the mode of infection must be
seriously reconsidered.
Since there seems to be no relationship physiologically
between host gametes and the parasite, it is interesting that they
are found in the same region of the coelom. If infection is through the
gut, and entero-coelomic migration does occur, it is possible that
the region surrounded by gametes is the region of the gut at which
sporozoites are released. Perhaps nutrients required both for
gametogenesis and by the parasited are passed to the coelom in this
region exclusively.
