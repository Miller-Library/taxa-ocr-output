V. INFECTION
(a) Frequency of Infection
The stages of the coelomic form are found exclusively in
that region which, in worms carrying on gametogenesis, bears the
gametes. Some hosts contain predominantly one systematic stage;
others contain several stages in similar proportions. From as few as
none to more than 100 parasites have been seen in a single host.
Tabulation of the data from the population survey
(text figure) shows that there is no correlation between gamete
development in the host and life-cycle of the parasite. Approximately
the same infection pattern exists at all stages of gametogenesis.
That the stages between syzygy and spore formation are present in
such relatively low proportions indicates that this period of the
cycle is relatively short.
(b) Spore Dispersal

It is interesting to note that during spawning of both male
-
and female worms in the aquaria, a few cysts and trophozoites were
seen to emerge with gametes through the gonopores. These spawnede
animals were then dissected, and found still to contain a large
number of parasites. Since a low proportion of the sporocysts are dispersed
during a spawn, and since there is no synchrony between the processes
of gametogenesis and parasite development, it is likely that this
is a coincidental dispersion mechanism.
