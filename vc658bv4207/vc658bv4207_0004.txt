Each worm was also classed according to the predominant developmental
phase of the parasite into one of six groups: 1) no parasites;
2) trophozoites; 3) associated sporadins; 4) gametocysts; 5) zygocysts;
and 6) sporocysts.
When coelomic forms had been examined, small portions of
the gut were excised, placed on microscope slides, teased apart with
needles, and pressed with the coverslip to spread the tissues and
reveal the attached trophozoites of the intestine.
Bouin-fixed and Masson's trichrome-stained serial paraffin
sections (12 microns thickness) of whole worms were examined for
attachment characteristics and evidence of entero-coelomic migration.
Methyl green and neutral red were used as vital stains. However,
unless otherwise noted all descriptions and illustrations in this
communication were made from untreated specimens,
An attempt was made to lyse the spores with egg white
lysozyme (Pentex), pronase (Calbiochem), dithioerythritol (DTE,
Sigma), DTE-pronase, sodium lauryl sulfate (Sigma), distilled water.
sea water, and extract of gut from the host. The gut extract was
prepared by homogenization of whole gastric tract at 0-5° C. in
buffered artificial sea water and subsequent centrifugation to
remove large particles. Twenty mature sporocysts were placed in each
culture chamber and about half were crushed with a glass rod to
release the spores. Each chamber was then filled with a lysing agent
and sealed with petroleum jelly under a coverslip. Cysts were
incubated with each lysing agent at 5P C., 14° C., and 21° C. up
to 24 hours, during which time they were examined frequently and compared.
