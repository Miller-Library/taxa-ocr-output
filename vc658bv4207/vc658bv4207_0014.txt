VIII. DESCRIPTION OF PLATES
All figures are drawn with the aid of camera lucida.
The specimens were untreated unless otherwise npted.
Plate I.
Figure a. The enteric type. Mature trophozoites. Note nucleoli
and longitudinal striations. (x 400)
Figure b. The enteric type. In coiled state after detachment from
intestinal epithelium. (x 400)
Figure c: 1-8. Rhe enteric type. Region about the nucleus during
peristaltic contractions. Note deformation of nuclear shape.
(x 400)
Figure d. The enteric type. Trichrome-stained paraffin section
(12 microns) through the intestine of C. spirabrancha showing
attachment point of a trophozoite. Note ectoplasmic septa
near anterior of trophozoite. (x 200)
Plate II.
Figure a. The coelomic type. Trophozoites. Note smoothness and
rigidity of pellicle. (x 100)
