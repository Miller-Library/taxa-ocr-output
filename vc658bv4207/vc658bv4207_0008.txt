(b) The Gametocyst
In other cysts, the nuclear membranes have disappeared
(plate IV, figure d); but at high magnification the cytoplasm looks
much the same as before (plate IV, figure f). At the same time, a loose
membrane has formed about the cyst, to persist throughout the
development.
(c) The zygocyst
Still other cysts contain a large number of roughly
spherical bodies (plate IV, figure g-i) which measure about 10
microns in diameter. The contain large phase-dense nuclear bodies
near their center.
(d) The sporocyst
The slightly flattened (plate IV, figure j) mature cysts
contain navicular or biconical spores (plate IV, figure 1) similar
in sice to the zygotes. The number of phase-dense bodies per
spore varies up to eight; these are the nuclei of the sporozoites.
