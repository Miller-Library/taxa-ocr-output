III. TROPHOZOITES OF THE INTESTINE
The mature trophozoite (plate I, figure a) measures about
0.20mm in length and about 0.0l mm in diameter. In situ, they move in
a pendular manner from their anterior attachment point on the
intestinal epithelium; The mode of attachment is unknown, but no
penetration of host tissue is visible in fixed and stained paraffin
sections at high magnification. When detached, they assume a spiral
or sigmoid shape (plate I, figure b). Longitudinal striations in
the pellicle are pronounced, numbering between ten and twenty.
The nucleus usually lies between one-tenth and one-fifth
of the length from the anterior end; one or two prominent nucleoli are
visible. The size and shape of the nucleus are variable (plate I.
figure c), depending upon stresses applied to it by the anterior and
posterior cytoplasmic masses during peristaltic contractions along the
entire length of the trophozoite.
In a fixed and stained cross section of one attachment region
of a trophozoite (plate I, figure d), the anterior end seems to be
transversely septate; no other such examples were seen, although
other attachment regions were examined.
