II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of C. spirabrancha were dug from the intertidal
mud flats under the south edge of Fisherman's Wharf in the Monterey
Harbor. Worms were brought into the laboratory with a generous
portion of their substrate, placed in aquaria, and supplied with
aerated flowing sea water. They were examined within forty-eight
hours after collection.
Worms of average size (approximately 0.25 gram) were picked
at random from the aquaria, relaxed in isotonic MgCl,, and dissected
by dorsolateral longitudinal incision of the body wall. The sex of
the worms and stage of gametogenesis were noted, and the number and
location of parasitic forms in the coelom were estimated. Specimens
of gregarine forms were first examined in situ under the dissecting
microscope, and then transferred by pasteur pipet to microscope
slides and covered with a supported coverslip. Cytoplasmic structures
and cyst contents were freed for examination at high magnification by
crushing them gently under the coverslip.
The contents of at least four cysts from each worm were
examined to determine the extent to which each developmental stage of
the parasite was present. Each host was then assigned to one of three
groups according to maturation of gametes: 1) immature, having no
gametes; 2) maturing, males having spermatid clusters and females
having small eggs in sacs; and 3) mature, having fully ripe gametes.
