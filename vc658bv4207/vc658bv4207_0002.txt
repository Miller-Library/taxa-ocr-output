I. INTRODUCTION
Gregarine parasitism has been extensively studied in
polychaetes (Ray, 1930; Miles, 1963; Dibb, 1938; Rees and Howell,
1966) cirratulids included (Cox, 1965). Most of these reports are
primarily concerned with gregarines found in the intestine. No
account is found of the acephaline form harbored in the coelom of
the cirratulid Cirriformia spirabrancha. Populations of C.
spirabrancha from Monterey, California are infected in high
frequency with a coelomic gregarine and at least one intestinal
sporozoan.
This communication describes some aspects of the
parasites of C. spirabrancha. Various stages of the life-cycle of
the coelomic type are demonstrated, and the trophic form of the
enteric type is introduced. Preliminary investigations into the
mechanism of infection are noted.
