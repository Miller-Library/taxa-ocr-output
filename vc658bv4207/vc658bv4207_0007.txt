shape at the anterior end, no attachment organelles are evident.
The nucleus is nearly spherical, having a flexible membrane that
endures when the trophozoite is crushed; it lies very near the anterior.
No nucleoli are evident in unstained specimens.
Peristaltic contractions are in general more subdued in
the mature trophozoite than in the small ones (plate II, figure a:
about 0.12 mm long). These smaller individuals are capable of a sort
of autoencystment (plate II, figure b-g), a phenomenon induced by
adverse conditions on the microscope slide.
Trophozoites in situ associate in pairs in various ways
(plate III, figures a, e, f). After the initial contact they draw
their "tails" around one another and then gradually reduce them,
Eventually their original morphology is lost (plate III, figure a-d),
and the cyst appears approximately spherical, with a diameter of
0.35-0.40 mm; both nuclei are still clearly evident. If the trophozo-
ites are pressed apart just as they have begun to reduce their
"tails" (plate III, figure b) they retain much of their original form
except that their "tails" appear annulated (plate III, figure g).
But if they are pressed after their association has become firmly
established (plate IV, figure b), they rupture. Upon examination at
high magnification, the cytoplasm appears much like that of the
trophozoite itself (plate IV, figure c).
