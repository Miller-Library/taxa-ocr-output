(c) Digestion of Spores by the Host
Unsuccessful attempts have been made to reinfect gregarine
hosts by feeding them mature cysts or spores. It was presumed that
reinfection is through ingestion of spores or sporocysts by the host:
the spore walls are digested by enzymes in the gut and the liberated
sporozoites migrate through the gut wall to the coelomic cavity.
where they mature.
Attempts to digest sporocysts and spores in vitro, using
proteolytic enzymes, polysaccharide degradingeagents, osmotic
shock, and extract of gut from the host all failed. It is possible
that the digestive process for spores is àn indûced one, and that
the capacity for enzyme production was lost during extraction of
gut enzymes. Further, no sporozoites have been observed in gut fluids,
and there was no evidence of entero-coelomic migration in the
serial paraffin sections.
