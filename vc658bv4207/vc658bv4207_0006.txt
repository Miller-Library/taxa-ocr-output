IV. THE COELOMIC TYPE
A complete life-cycle of the coelomic gregarine of C.
spirabrancha has not been followed in a single individual. But by
carefully observing all systematic changes of different individuals,
and using outlines (Kudo, 1946; Hyman, 1940; Calkins, 1933;
Mackinnan and Hawes, 1961) of the life-cycles of similar species,
one may hypothesize the continuum of events which brings about the
developmental cycle.
In other acephaline eugregarines, syzygy is followed by a
multiple fission of the haploid sporont nuclei. The resulting gametes
fuse, and a spore case develops around the resulting zygote. Meiosis
occurs, producing haploid sporozoites capable of reinfection and
development to mature trophozoites.
The parasite of the coelom of C. spirabrancha is presumedn
to have a similar life-cycle, and a similar logical progression has
been applied to what has been observed in this species.


(a) The Trophic Phase; Syzygy

The trophozoites are elongate and teardrop-shaped.
measuring 1.0 to 1.2 mm in length and about 0.1 mm in diameter at the
thickest region when mature. The pellicle is smooth and unstriated,
but sufficiently firm to buckle when the parasite is sharply bent
(plate II, figure a). Though the pellicle is thickest and has a conical
