Qio Calculations
Qio values between each temperature interval (10.5°C - 16°C, 16°C - 21°c.
10.5°C -21°C) were determined for each species at each time point by using the Q10
equation (Q10 (ki/k2)""2) from Hochachka and Somero (2002). For an overall Q1o
value that incorporated all three temperature intervals at a given time point, inputs for the
equation were derived from a regression curve that fit a line of feeding rate versus
temperature.
Respirometry
Respirometry trials were conducted in order to assess differences between the two
species at a constant temperature. Whelks used in these trials were maintained in ambient
seawater and left unfed for at least 5 days. Äfter puncturing the plastic corks of glass
chambers (134mL) with a 10mL syringe (B-D 10mL Latex-free Syringe, Becton
Dickinson and Co., Rutherford, NJ) and a PrecisionGlide needle (18G1 ½, Becton
Dickinson, NJ), whelks were placed into several sealed chambers filled with ambient
seawater. To allow the whelks to equilibrate to the assay temperature of 12.2°C, the
chambers were then placed in a 12.2°C water bath for 40 minutes. The assay temperature
was chosen to approximate ambient seawater temperatures experienced by the whelks at
that time. Data were recorded using PowerLab (model 8SP, ADInstruments, Mountain
View, CA) and the PowerLab Chart Program. Seawater aerated with an air pump was
used to calibrate the oxygen electrode to 100% saturation, and sodium sulfite was used to
calibrate the electrode to 0% saturation.
