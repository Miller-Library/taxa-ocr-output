After a 40 minute equilibration, a gas-tight syringe was used to remove 1mL
seawater from each chamber and, then, to inject the seawater into the electrode unit. The
1OmL syringe served as a reservoir of seawater to replace the ImL fraction and prevent
the build-up of negative pressure inside the chamber. Further 1mL fractions were
removed at 30 minute intervals for 120-150 minutes. Each trial included an empty
chamber as a control. At the end of each trial, whelks were dissected and weighed to
determine wet weights. Also, the volume of seawater in each chamber was measured.
Change in percent O2 saturation over the time course was calculated using a
regression curve fitting the percent O2 saturation at each interval. The slope of the contro
was subtracted from the slope of an experimental chamber to determine actual percent
change in O2 saturation in a given chamber. Using the resulting slopes, the mass-specific
oxygen consumption rates were calculated.
Statistical Analysis
Replicate plastic containers were the experimental unit and, as such, average
feeding rates were measured per container. Temperature data-loggers within each tank
confirmed that each container experienced the same temperature range in any tank
undergoing the same temperature regime. Thus, each container was treated as an
independent unit. With two different species at three temperature treatments over 4 time
points, the experiment involved 96 combinations of feeding rates per treatment per
container. Thus, a factorial ANÃ–VA was used to determine the effect of period, species,
and temperature on feeding rate. In addition, the interactions among period and species.
