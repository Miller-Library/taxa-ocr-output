Conclusions
The physiological results of this study correlate with the thermal environments
inhabited by N.emarginata and N.ostrina. Though both species show similar patterns of
thermal dependency of feeding, N.emarginata exhibits greater maximum feeding rates
and greater O2 consumption rates. Living at higher temperatures, N.emarginata might
have higher feeding rates in order to cover the costs of higher metabolic activity. As the
climate warms, N.emarginata may be able to take advantage of its temperature
adaptations to out-compete N.ostrina in regions of overlapping populations. Both species
of Nucella showed feeding rates that changed over time, but N.emarginata had a
prolonged satiation phase compared to N.ostrina. In contrast, N.ostrina’s lower maximal
feeding rates were more consistent over time. Thus, in habitats where food can be scarce,
N.emarginata could rapidly increase feeding rate when food is available but then wait in
its longer satiation phase when food is in short supply. Net energy input would be greater
for N.emarginata, especially at temperatures near or above 21°C. Though Marko suggests
that N.emarginata’s northward range expansion was probably not due to climatic change,
the results here suggest that climatic change could potentially accelerate the process.
