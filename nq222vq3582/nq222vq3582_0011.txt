Results
Several interspecific, thermal, and temporal comparisons will be delineated in the
following section. First, feeding rates will be compared between species at specific
temperatures and time periods and between time periods for each species at a particular
temperature. Feeding rate ranges for the entire experiment will then be compared
between species for each temperature. Second, for each time period, overall Qjo values
will be presented for each species. Qio ranges of each temperature interval for each
species will be given. Third, total consumption rates at each temperature treatment and
total Qjo values for the entire experimental period will be compared between species.
Finally, the respiration rates of each species will be given.
Temperature Treatments
Temperatures for the 10.5°C and 21°C treatments were within +0.5°C of desired
values throughout the experimental period. Ambient temperatures were more variable but
averaged -16°C. (Fig. 1)
Absolute Feeding Rates
N.emarginata tended to have higher feeding rates than N.ostrina during the first
14 days while N.ostrina appeared to have greater feeding rates after 21 and 28 days. At
21°C, N.emarginata had significantly higher feeding rates than N.ostrina during periods
and 2 (Fig. 2., Student-Newman-Keuls Test, px0.05). N.emarginata feeding rates were
again significantly greater at 10.5°C during period 1, while N.ostrina had significantly
