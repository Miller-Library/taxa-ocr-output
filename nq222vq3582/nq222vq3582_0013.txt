Qio values increased from 1.57 to 2.15 during the first 14 days. By day 21, the Qjo spiked
at 5.35 and then rapidly declined to 1.67 by the end of the experimental period.
Thermal Dependence: Q1o Values Between Temperature Intervals
With the notable exception of the 10.5°C -16°C temperature interval,
N.emarginata and N.ostrina had similar ranges for Qjo values in each temperature
interval over the course of 28 days. In the 10.5°C -16°C temperature interval, Qjo values
of N.emarginata ranged from 1.30 to 13.5 (Table 1). In contrast, the 16°C - 21°C interval
was less varied with a Qjo range of 1.43 to 3.19. Finally, a gradual increase in Q10
occurred in the 10.5°C - 21°C interval with a range of 1.61 to 4.39. For N.ostrina, the
10.5°C - 16°C interval again displayed a relatively large Qio range (0.91 to 5.97). The
16°C -21°C interval had a Q1o range of 0.84 to 3.29 while the 10.5°C -21°C interval had a
range of 1.63 to 4.43.
Total Consumption Rates and Total Q1o Values
Total consumption rates increased with increasing water temperature but were not
significantly different between species at any temperature (Fig. 5, Student-Newman-
Keuls Test, p20.05). N.emarginata’s total consumption rates were 1.06, 1.71, and 2.48 at
10.5°C, 16°C, and 21°C, respectively. Similarly, N.ostrina’s total consumption rates were
0.994, 1.58, and 2.07 at 10.5°C, 16°C, and 21°C, respectively. The overall Qio value for
the entire 28-day period was 1.96 for N.emarginata and 1.92 for N.ostrina (Fig. 6).
