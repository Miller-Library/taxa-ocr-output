Acknowledgements
First and foremost, I would like to thank George Somero for his guidance, support, sense
of humor, and belief. His passion for marine biology was truly infectious. Jim Watanabe
also provided insightful advice and was incredibly helpful with experimental design and
statistical analysis. I would also like to thank the entire Somero Lab for supporting this
work through thoughtful advice and technical assistance. Though not currently at
Hopkins Marine Station, Eric Sanford provided much of the inspiration behind this
project and never failed to answer even the most na√Øve queries via lengthy email
correspondence. In addition to Eric, Brad Buckley of UC Santa Barbara and colleagues
from Oregon State University helped obtain organisms required for this work. Also, I
owe much to my fellow Bio 175H students who provided a wonderful atmosphere for
learning and research in an idyllic setting. I could not have completed this project without
their help and support. Finally, I would like to thank all the instructors involved in 175H
who carry on the venerable tradition of turning wide-eyed undergraduates into budding
researchers. This course has been challenging and laden with unforeseen obstacles, and
yet it has also been one of the most rewarding of my Stanford career.
