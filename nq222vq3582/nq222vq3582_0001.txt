Abstract In this study, I examined predation by two species of whelk on bay
mussels (Mytilus trossulus) to determine whether a northern-occurring species (Nucella
ostrina) and a southern-occurring species (Nucella emarginata) differed in absolute
feeding rate and thermal dependence of feeding. I also examined the respiration rates of
these congeners. Each species was held in three temperature treatments: 21°C,-16°C
(ambient), and 10.5°C for 28 days. Across all temperatures, N.emarginata usually had
higher feeding rates than N.ostrina for the first 14 days, but, after 21 and 28 days,
N.ostrina tended to have higher feeding rates. Feeding by both species displayed classical
physiological responses to temperature (Qios 2) for the first 14 days. By the twenty-first
day, when satiation seemed to occur, Q1o values increased to 4.49 and 5.35 for
N.emarginata and N.ostrina, respectively. In particular, both species at 10.5°C
demonstrated considerably reduced feeding rates upon satiation. This suggests that
metabolic costs were much lower at 10.5°C and, therefore, the animals required less
energy input after satiation. While N.ostrina’s Qjo value declined to 1.67 after an
additional 7 days, N.emarginata’s Qjo value declined to 3.40. Total consumption rates for
the entire experimental period were not significantly different between species at any
temperature. These results suggest that, while N.ostrina feeding rates may be lower after
a starvation period, N.ostrina is able to maintain similar levels of energy input over the
long-term by having a shorter satiation phase. In the respirometry experiment,
N.emarginata had significantly higher O2 consumption rates (0.16% 02 consumed/mI
seawater/hr/g) than N.ostrina (0.050% O2 consumed/mL seawater/hr/g). The
physiological results of this study correlate with the thermal habitats of N.emarginata and
N.ostrina and may have implications for global warming.
