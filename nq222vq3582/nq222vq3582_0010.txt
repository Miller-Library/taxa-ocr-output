between all three factors, period, species, and temperature, was tested via factorial
ANÖVA. Systat Version 8.0 was used for ANÖVA analyses. By utilizing the Student-
Newman-Keuls test for differences among means, statistically significant differences
among species at the same time point and under the same temperature treatment were
determined. At the end of the experiment, again using a Student-Newman-Keuls test,
differences between total consumption rates were identified. In the respirometry
experiment, a one-way ANOVA was used to calculate the effect of species difference on
respiration rates.
