Total Consumption Rates
Since total consumption rates were not significantly different between species at
any temperature, N.ostrina may use a shorter satiation phase to compensate for lower
feeding capacity and thus maintain comparable energy input to N.emarginata over the
long term. On the other hand, N.ostrina might be better equipped to adapt to stress (e.g.
re-circulated water flow, bacteria) since it returned to higher feeding rates by the end of
the experiment.
Q1o Effects
The results of this study suggest that N.emarginata and N.ostrina have similar
feeding rate responses to temperature over the long term. Qjo values for the 28-day
experiment were 1.96 and 1.92 for N.emarginata and N.ostrina, respectively. The thermal
dependence of feeding for N.emarginata changed considerably over time. The increase in
Q1o value from 2.77 at period 2 to 4.49 at period 3 was driven primarily by sharp
reductions in feeding rate at 10.5°C. In fact, the Q1o value for the 10.5°C- 16°C interval
climbed sharply from 1.91 to 10.6. This is not unusual since much higher Qio values have
been observed for 10°C- 15°C intervals (Q10= 25) in temperature-dependent feeding of
the oyster drill Urosalpinx cinera on mussels (Hanks, 1957). Sanford (2002) showed
comparable Qjo effects for N.canaliculata (Qio’s ranging from approximately 2.4 to 7.1
between 9°C and 12°C). N.emarginata may have experienced much lower metabolic
costs at the lower temperature. Also, N.emarginata’s thermal dependence of feeding may
decrease with increasing temperature as satiation ensues. N.ostrina also showed a peak in
Q1o (5.35) at period 3, again driven by lower feeding rates at 10.5°C and a high Q1o
