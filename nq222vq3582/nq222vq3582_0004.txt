species? (4) Do respiration rates correlate with feeding rates? The results suggest that
N. emarginata has higher maximal feeding rates than N.ostrina. For both species, feeding
rates were thermally dependent, and thermal dependency changed over time. At a
constant 12.2Â°C, N.emarginata had significantly greater respiration rates than N.ostrina.
The physiological results correlate with the thermal environments occupied by each
species. As climate change occurs, N.emarginata may have a selective advantage in
regions where the congeners have overlapping populations.
