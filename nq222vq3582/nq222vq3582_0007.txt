treatment included 16 whelks of each species. The entire experiment comprised forty-
eight N.emarginata and forty-eight N.ostrina.
Whelks were then acclimated at ambient temperature without food for 4 days. On
April 30, 2003, temperatures were ramped down for the 10.5°C treatment and ramped up
for the 21°C treatment. Once the desired temperatures were attained, 25 mussels were
added to each plastic container.
Feeding Rate Measurements and Calculations
After 7 days, the numbers of dead mussels with drilled boreholes were counted
and replaced with live mussels. Dead mussels without boreholes were also replaced but
were not included in whelk feeding rates. In addition, live mussels with partially drilled
boreholes were neither replaced nor included in feeding rate measurements. The process
was repeated for three more weeks to obtain data for 4 time periods over the course of 28
days. Feeding rates were calculated by dividing the number of mussels consumed by the
total number of whelks per container. If whelk mortality took place over the course of a
7-day time period, then the factor (0.5)X(number of dead whelks) was subtracted from
the total number of whelks in a particular container. This factor calculated the number of
dead whelks between two time points since I could not be certain when a whelk died
during 7 day time period. For the following time period, assuming no more whelks
perished, the number of whelks in the container would equal the number alive at the
previous time point.
