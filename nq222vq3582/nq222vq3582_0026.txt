Fig. 1. Water Temperatures during the 28-day N.emarginata and N.ostrina feeding rates
experiment. Whelks were held in three treatments: constant 10.5°C,-16°C (ambient), and
21°C. Temperatures were recorded every ten minutes during temperature ramping and
every thirty minutes for the rest of the experimental time period.
Fig. 2. N.emarginata and N.ostrina feeding rates in three laboratory treatments over a
four week time period. Bars are mean number of mussels eaten per whelk per 7 days (n-
4 containers per treatment). Ästerisks above bars indicate statistical differences between
species (Student-Newman-Keuls Test, px0.05
Fig. 3. N.emarginata in three laboratory treatments over a four week time period. Bars
are mean number of mussels eaten per whelk per 7 days (n= 4 containers per treatment).
Identical letters above bars indicate statistical differences between time periods at a given
temperature treatment (Student-Newman-Keuls Test, p£0.05). Qjo values for a given
period are indicated above each set of bars.
Fig. 4. N.ostrina in three laboratory treatments over a four week time period. Bars are
mean number of mussels eaten per whelk per 7 days (n= 4 containers per treatment).
Identical letters above bars indicate statistical differences between time periods at a given
temperature treatment. Qio values for a given period are indicated above each set of bars.
Fig. 5. N.emarginata and N.ostrina total feeding rates in three temperature treatments.
Bars are mean number of mussels eaten per whelk over 28 days (n= 4 containers per
treatment). Ästerisks above bars indicate statistical differences between species (Student-
Newman-Keuls Test, p50.05)
Fig. 6. N. emarginata and N.ostrina total feeding rates in three temperature treatments.
Colored lines indicate actual feeding rates at each temperature over 28 days, and dashec
lines indicate regression curves. Qjo values calculated from regression curves are noted.
Fig. 7. N.emarginata and N.ostrina respiration rates. Bars are mean respiration rates of
%02 consumed per mL seawater per hour per gram wet weight. The star indicates a
statistical difference between respiration rates of the two species (one-way ANÖVA.
p50.001, N.emarginata n-9, N.ostrina n= 12)
