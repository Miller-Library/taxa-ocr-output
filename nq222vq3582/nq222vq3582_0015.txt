Discussion
The results of this study suggest that Nemarginata is capable of feeding and
respiring at much higher rates than N.ostrina and that N.emarginata is also more likely to
decrease feeding rates in response to satiation. While N.ostrina may not reach
N.emarginata’s high feeding rates, N.ostrina tends to be less sensitive to satiation.
Alternatively, changes in feeding rates over time may have been distorted by stressful
laboratory conditions. In addition, since the feeding history of either species could not be
ascertained, changes in feeding rates may have also been due to different initial energy
stores. Nevertheless, over the long-term, both species exhibit similar average feeding
rates at all temperatures. Both Nucella congeners also have feeding rate sensitivity to
water temperature. Though fluctuations in Qjo occur for both species between 7-day
intervals, N.emarginata and N.ostrina have Qjo’s close to 2 over a longer time period (28
days).
Average Feeding Rates: N.emarginata
Observed feeding rates for N.emarginata over the first two time periods tended to
be higher than expected given feeding rates from related experiments on thermal
dependence of feeding for drilling whelks. Studies performed on N.canaliculata used
larger size ranges of mussels and mussels were counted every 14 days (Sanford, 2002).
Thus, in such experiments, fewer mussels would provide the same energy input.
Over time, N.emarginata seemed to ramp down feeding rate more quickly at 16°C
and especially 10.5°C. Perhaps, between periods 1 and 2, satiation had a more
pronounced effect at lower temperatures because of lower metabolic costs associated
