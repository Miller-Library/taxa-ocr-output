Experimental Design
In order to assess physiological differences between N.emarginata and N.ostrina,
1 first investigated feeding rates for each species under three different temperature
regimes: (1) 10.5°C, (2)-16°C (ambient), and (3) 21°C. All whelks were kept submerged
during the experimental period except during weekly mussel counting.
Six glass tanks (77 L, 76cm x 31.Scm x 36.Scm) filled with seawater were placed
in an outdoor pavilion at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA, for the controlled
treatments. The closed tanks were covered with fiberglass sheets and kept well-shaded.
The light/dark cycle for the experimental period coincided with daily shifts at Pacific
Grove from April 25, 2003, to May 29, 2003.
For the ambient treatment, two 77L tanks were placed on the floor of the outdoor
pavilion. For the 10.5°C treatment, two tanks were placed in a larger tank (770L, 180cm
x 88cm x 36cm) whose temperature was controlled with a custom freon-based chiller and
affixed temperature controller (Digital Temperature Controller, Aqua Logic, Inc.). The
final two tanks were placed in a 770L tank containing an immersion heater (112 Silica
Glass Power heater, 500 W, with temperature controller), which served as a water bath
for the 21°C treatment (Fig. 10). Each water bath contained two water pumps (Via Aqua
1300) to maintain a continuous flow of freshwater around the glass tanks. Water
temperatures in the glass tanks were raised for the 21°C treatment and lowered for the
10.5°C treatment over the course of approximately 7 hours and self-regulated by
temperature sensors which maintained the set temperatures within +0.5°C.
