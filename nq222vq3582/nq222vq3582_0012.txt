greater feeding rates at 10.5°C during period 4 (Student-Newman-Keuls Test, pæ0.05).
Under ambient conditions for all time points, no significant interspecific differences in
feeding rate were present (Student-Newman-Keuls Test, p20.05)
N.emarginata displayed more temporal variation in feeding rate than N.ostrina.
At 21°C and 10.5°C, Nemarginata had a significant decrease in feeding rate between the
second and third period (Fig. 3, Student-Newman-Keuls Test, p«0.05). N.ostrina,
however, had no significant changes in feeding rate over time across all temperatures
except for a significant increase in feeding rate at 10.5°C between period 3 and 4 (Fig. 4,
Student-Newman-Keuls Test, p20.05).
In the 21°C temperature treatment, N.emarginata exhibited feeding rates in the
range 1.56 to 3.63 mussels per whelk per 7 days (Fig. 3). In contrast, Nostrina’s range of
feeding rates at 21°C was 1.94 to 2.29 mussels per whelk per 7 days (Fig. 4). At ambient
temperature, N.emarginata demonstrated a feeding rate range of 1.16 to 2.56 while
N.ostrina’s range was 1.103 to 2.25 at the same temperature. N.emarginata had a range
of 0.357 to 2.25 in the 10.5°C temperature treatment while N.ostrina had a range of 0.452
to 1.40.
Thermal Dependence: Qjo Values Between Time Periods
Feeding rates of both N.emarginata and N.ostrina were sensitive to changes in
water temperature (ANÖVA, F-ratio= 28.405, p50.001). Overall Qjo values, derived
from regression curves (see Materials and Methods), showed that N.emarginata had
Qjo’s of 1.64 and 2.77 for periods 1 and 2, respectively (Table 1). After 21 days, the Q1o
climbed to 4.49 and then decreased slightly to 3.40. N.ostrina presented a similar pattern.
