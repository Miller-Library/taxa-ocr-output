Each 77L glass tank contained a filter and water pump (Duetto DJ-100) to
cleanse, circulate, and oxygenate the seawater. In addition, approximately 50 percent of
the tank volume of seawater was changed every 4 to 7 days. Using temperature data-
loggers (Optic StowAway, Onset Computer Corp., Pocasset, MA) submerged in each
tank, water temperatures were recorded every 10 minutes during temperature ramping
and every 30 minutes during the rest of the experimental period.
Organisms
On 23 April, 2003, N.emarginata were collected from the Coal Point rocky
intertidal zone at the University of California, Santa Barbara. N.ostrina were collected on
April 24, 2003, from wave-exposed areas at Soberanes Point, CA. Whelk lengths were
measured for both species, and those with similar size ranges were used in the feeding
experiment. N.ostrina had a size range of 19.9- 26.8 mm, and N.emarginata had a size
range of 18.2-26.0 mm. Bay mussels (Mytilis trossulus) were collected from Strawberry
Hill, Oregon, on April 23, 2003. The mussels were cleaned, sorted for a size range of 15.
25 mm, and then placed in flowing ambient seawater.
Feeding Experiment
Whelks were placed in identical plastic containers (975 mL, Berry Plastics Corp..
Evansville, IN) drilled with small holes (8mm diameter). Each tank held two containers
with four N.ostrina per container and two containers with four N.emarginata per
container. Thus, each tank contained eight whelks of each species, and each temperature
