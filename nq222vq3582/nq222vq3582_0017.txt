Average Feeding Rates: N.ostrina
While feeding rates at 21°C remained quite constant for N.ostrina over all time
periods, feeding rates at 16°C and 10.5°C declined from period 1 through period 3. Again.
lower metabolic costs at the cooler temperatures may have allowed a more significant
response to satiation. By period 3, N.ostrina feeding rates closely matched those of
N.emarginata, but, by period 4, N.ostrina had increased feeding at both temperature
extremes. These results suggest that feeding rates during satiation for both species are
similar in absolute terms, but N.ostrina is not as far from its maximum feeding capability
In addition, N.ostrina seemed to rebound from a sated state more quickly, implying that
N.ostrina has a shorter satiation phase to compensate for a lower maximum feeding rate.
At 21°C, N.ostrina’s metabolic processes may be operating at rates that preclude
satiation. Feeding rates may not be able to increase further because N.ostrina may already
be close to the maximum rate of feeding that is physically permissible for the whelk.
Thus, feeding rates stay at a high level to keep up with metabolic costs. This is consistent
with Marko’s (1998) conclusions that N.ostrina do not live south of Point Conception.
where a 4°C increase in temperature occurs. N.ostrina in 21°C water temperatures may be
close to their thermal limit for feeding.
