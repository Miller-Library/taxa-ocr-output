with lower temperatures. Alternatively, the reductions in feeding rates at lower
temperatures may have been due to stress associated with laboratory conditions. In this
alternative scenario, N.emarginata at the lower temperatures responded to stress by
reducing feeding rates more rapidly.
By period 3, feeding rates at lower temperatures again declined. However, in this
case, N.emarginata at 21°C finally responded to satiation by considerably decreasing
feeding rates. The higher metabolic rates at higher temperatures may have required
N. emarginata to maintain elevated feeding rates for a longer time period. N.emarginata’s
potential for high feeding rates is consistent with its designation as a southern
thermophilic species by Marko (1998). Living in habitats with higher water temperatures
one would expect N.emarginata to have a higher feeding rate capacity in order to
compensate for the greater metabolic costs.
Between the third and fourth period, N.emarginata feeding rates remained
relatively constant at all temperatures. This suggests that either N.emarginata reached a
minimum feeding rate associated with satiation or that, even under stress, N.emarginata
had minimum feeding requirements. Since Nucella species have been shown to live for
months without food (Sanford, personal communication), the latter explanation may be
less likely. Also, if stress is playing the major role, then one might expect that feeding
rates would decline further by period 4, but this does not occur. In addition, despite
having no mortality at 21°C, N.emarginata showed a significant reduction in feeding rate
at that temperature between periods 2 and 3.
