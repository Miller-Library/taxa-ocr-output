Urosalpinx cinerea, Hanks (1957) investigated predation rates on Mytilus edulis and
noted that increases in temperature considerably increased feeding rates (Qjo value of
5.06 between 15°C and 20°C). Largen (1967) performed similar experiments with Thais
(Nucella) lapillus, a species more closely related to Nemarginata and N.ostrina, and sav
a Q1o value of 3.2 between 15°C and 20°C. Sanford (2002) conducted experiments with
Pisaster ochraceus and Nucella canaliculata preying on Mytilus trossulus to determine
the effects of small temperature changes (9°C to 12°C) and episodic upwelling on the
predation rates of these organisms. Again, increased temperature caused significant
increases in predation rates. (Qio's ranging from approximately 2.4 to 7.1 for
N. canalicuata and 2.5 to 4.3 for Pisaster ochraceus).
Metabolic activity, measured as a respiration rate, has been determined for other
Nucella species, but little has been done to compare N.emarginata and N.ostrina. Bayne
and Scullard (1978) investigated the respiration rates of Thais (Nucella) lapillus at
different temperatures and starvation conditions. Stickle and Bayne (1982) extended this
analysis to include salinity effects on oxygen consumption. Recently, Dahlhoff et al
(2001) have tested respiration rates of N.ostrina in Oregon field sites that experience
different seasonal temperatures. VO2 ranged from -2 to 4 mmol O/hr/g wet weight for
unfed whelks at Boiler Bay, OR, during the summer.
In order to assess physiological differences between N.emarginata and N.ostrina,
I investigated the feeding rates, thermal dependency of feeding, and respiration rates of
each species. I attempted to address the following questions: (1) Do feeding rates differ
between species and change over time? (2) Are feeding rates thermally dependent and
does thermal dependency change over time? (3) Do respiration rates differ between
