Introduction
The latitudinal temperature variability of coastal waters of the North American
Pacific coast can furnish intertidal organisms with different thermal habitats. The effects
of ocean temperatures on predatory behavior and metabolic activity have long been
recognized (Broekhuysen, 1940; Sanford, 1999; Hochachka and Somero, 2002), but little
study has been dedicated to two recently differentiated congeneric species of rocky
intertidal whelk. The Southern species (Nucella emarginata) resides in warmer waters
than its Northern counterpart (Nucella ostrina) yet both species prey on a variety of the
same animals, such as barnacles (Balanus glandula) and mussels (Mytilus trossulus,
Mytilus californianus, Mytilus galloprovincialis), in the mid-to low- intertidal zone.
Utilizing a proboscis to drill through the exterior shells of their prey, the whelks ingest
tissue via a drilled borehole. In addition, the shell morphology of these species is often
indistinguishable. Because of the behavioral and phylogenetic similarities between these
species, N.emarginata and N.ostrina provide useful models for comparing the effects of
temperature on physiology.
In 1990, Palmer et al. were the first to suggest that N.emarginata may actually
comprise two reproductively isolated cryptic species. Marko (1998) later concluded that
N.ostrina and N.emarginata were allopatrically speciated by physical isolation in
different zoogeographic provinces. The dramatic 4Â°C increase in sea surface temperatures
south of Point Conception established the physical boundary that separated these
populations.
In laboratory studies, changes in water temperature have been shown to
dramatically alter the feeding behavior of intertidal organisms. For the oyster drill
