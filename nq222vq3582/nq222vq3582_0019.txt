between 10.5°C and 16°C (5.97). Thus, Nostrina exhibited similar thermal dependence
patterns as N.emarginata until period 3. By period 4, the overall Q1o value returned to a
level similar to period 1. This suggests that, whether as a recovery from satiation or
stress, N.ostrina can decrease its thermal dependence of feeding more rapidly than
N. emarginata.
Respirometry
Surprisingly, N.emarginata, the southern thermophile, showed higher oxygen
consumption rates than N.ostrina. Inhabiting the warmer waters south of Point
Conception, one would expect N.emarginata to have lower metabolic activity at a given
temperature. Further study needs to be conducted to confirm the results found here and to
determine the thermal dependency of respiration for both species.
N.emarginata’s high maximum feeding rates might be required to replace the
energy lost through its higher metabolic costs. Respirometry showed that N.emarginata
tended to have more variable respiration rates at 12.2°C than N.ostrina. Thus,
N.emarginata might also have a greater ability to alter metabolic activity in response to
temperature changes. Greater metabolic plasticity in N.emarginata might help explain
N.emarginata’s prolonged response to satiation and thus also clarify why N.emarginata
and N.ostrina had similar total consumption rates by the end of the experiment.
Alternatively, the N.emarginata sample size may have been too low to reduce variation in
respiration readings.
