Sulfide Binding Characteristics of.
Introduction
Calyptogena pacifica and Vesicomya gigas are members of the
deep-sea clam family Vesicomyidae. Both burrow in the soft,
sulfide-rich benthic substrate surrounding hydrothermal vents or
cold seeps. In the last four years, they have been discovered in the
Monterey Submarine Canyon near cold seeps between 550 and 900
meters depth. The large sulfur-rich gills of the animals contain
intracellular symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria. The clams'
feeding grooves and guts are simple and reduced in size, suggesting
that they rely on nutritional supplements from their symbionts.
This is corroborated by isotopically light carbon isotope levels, as
are typical of chemosynthetically derived carbon (J. P. Barry, pers.
comm.).
The clams are oriented with their feet buried in the reducing
substrate and their siphons exposed to the relatively sulfide-free
bottom water. It has been hypothesized that they take up sulfide
through the foot and obtain carbon dioxide and oxygen from overlying
ambient seawater (Arp et al. 1984). This would require a system to
transport the sulfide through the clams' circulatory system from the
foot to the bacteria in the gills without poisoning the surrounding
tissues or oxidizing the reduced, energy-rich form of sulfur.
Sulfide, even at nanomolar concentrations, is a potent inhibitor of
aereobic respiration through the cytochrome-c oxidase system
(National Research Council 1979). Sulfide inhibition of cytochromeÂ¬
c oxidase from the giant hydrothermal vent clam C. magnifica has
been shown to be offset by the re-addition of the clam's blood to the
system (Powell and Somero 1986), suggesting that the binding
agents serve to protect the animals' tissues as well as provide
