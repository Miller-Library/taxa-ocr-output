Sulfide Binding Characteristics of
were at least an order of magnitude above the ambient levels. V.
gigas appeared to reach saturation at about 5000 uM, but three
outlying data points prohibit conclusive assertions. C. pacifica
consistently bound higher levels of sulfide than V. gigas. Again,
quantitative comparison between the two clams is difficult as there
appear to be some outlying points. The range of external sulfide
concentrations used in these trials may not have saturated the
serum of C. pacifica, as the upward trend did not approach an
asymptote similar to that evident in V. gigas.
V. gigas accumulated sulfide faster than C. pacifica, but reached
saturation at a lower sulfide concentration than C. pacifica (Fig. 2).
V. gigas initially bound sulfide at a rate of 350 umolel serumeminÂ¬
', while C. pacifica concentrated it a little less than half the speed,
at 156 umolsl serummin". V. gigas appeared to reach saturation
at a concentration of approximately 5000 uM, which is consistant
with the trend seen in the study of sulfide binding as a function of
external concentration. Again, C. pacifica did not clearly reach
saturation, as the serum sulfide concentrations at the highest
external sulfide levels still show an upward trend.
Discussion
Sulfide binding in vesicomyid clams serves three vital functions.
It prevents sulfide poisoning of aerobic metabolism, concentrates
sulfide and transports it from the uptake site in the foot to the
symbiotic bacteria in the gill, and preserves the most reduced,
energy-rich form of sulfur by preventing the spontaneous oxidation
of sulfide during transport. As animals sacrificed the day after
collection displayed the same sulfide binding curve as those
