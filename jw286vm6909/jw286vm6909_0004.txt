Sulfide Binding Characteristics of.
performed using clam serum. Whole blood was centrifuged for ten
minutes at 62006. The serum was extracted and diluted ten fold
with 0.2 um filtered, UV-sterilized sea water. The dilutions were
then aliquoted in 1 ml quantities in dialysis membrane tubing (MWCO
12-14,000, Spectra/Por 42). All visible air bubbles were evacuated
and both ends of the dialysis tubing were clamped.
A 0.4 M hydrogen sulfide stock solution was made with de¬
oxygenated filtered sea water and sodium sulfide crystals. Ten
percent HCI was added to re-establish a pH of 8. This stock was
used for all subsequent working concentrations of sulfide.
Sulfide Incubations
For each measurement of sulfide binding as a function of external
concentration, 750 ml of filtered sea water was bubbled with
nitrogen for ten minutes to remove all oxygen. The appropriate
amount of sulfide stock was then added to achieve the desired
sulfide concentration. One dialysis bag each of C. pacifica and V.
gigas dilute serum was added and the jars were sealed with
Parafilm and screw caps. After at least six hours of incubation at
4° C, the serum samples and the dialysate were analyzed for sulfide
content using a HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph modified for
quantitation of dissolved gases in liquid samples (Childress et al.,
1984) as descibed below.
250 ul of each sample was injected using a gas-tight syringe
(Hamilton) into a heated, teflon-sealed, glass extraction chamber
pre-loaded with dilute, gas stripped phosphoric acid and silicon
anti-foam. As the sample entered the extraction chamber, dissolved
carbonates (CO32“, HCO3-, H2CO3) and sulfides (82-, HS) were
