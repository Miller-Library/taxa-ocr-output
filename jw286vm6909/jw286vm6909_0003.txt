Sulfide Binding Characteristics of..
sulfide for their symbionts.
The circulatory systems of vesicomyid clams contain ample
quantities of blood with hemoglobin containing red blood cells.
Studies of C. magnifica and C. elongata have found a sulfide-specific
binding moiety in the animals' blood serum (Childress et. al 1993,
Arp et. al 1984); preliminary research on C. ponderosa and V.
cordata indicates that their blood has a similar capacity for sulfide
accumulation (Fisher 1990). I set out to explore the binding
characteristics, over different concentrations and times of
incubation, of C. pacifica and V. gigas blood serum.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Animals
Organisms were collected using Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute’s (MBARI) remote operated vehicle RÖV Ventana from cold
seep locations around the Monterey Canyon. Collection sites ranged
from 550-900 meters in depth. The two clams studied, Vesicomya
gigas and Calyptogena pacifica, are associated with sulfide-rich
seeps. Animals were maintained from one to ninety days in 4° C
reduced oxygen sea water at atmospheric pressure until they were
sacrificed. Animal shells were scrubbed clean and shaken to
evacuate water before dissection. All blood was aspirated in
syringes, pooled, and stored at 4° C.
Sample Preparation
Initial studies concluded that whole blood and extracted serum
displayed the same binding sensitivity, so experiments were
