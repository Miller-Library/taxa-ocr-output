converted to CO2 and H2S (respectively), and were stripped, along
with other dissolved gases (e.g. O2, N2, CH4, CO), by helium carrier
gas flowing through the chamber. This gas mixure was then carried
directly to a packed column (6' x 1/8” teflon-lined stainless steel,
packed with Unibeads 1S 80/100) where CO2 and H2S were separated
from the remaining gases, which passed through an automatically¬
actuated valve onto a second column (18' x 1/8" stainless steel,
packed with Mol Seive 5A 60/80) for further separation. Upon
elution from the columns, concentrations of all gases were
determined using a thermal conductivity detector.
To determine the time course of sulfide uptake, several serum
samples from both species were placed in a 1-liter volume of
300450 UM sulfide solution. The dialysate was stirred continuously
to ensure uniform sulfide distribution. At each time point, one pair
of serum samples was removed and immediately placed in air tight
syringes to prevent the sulfide from oxidizing. The initial and final
dialysate and the samples were then analyized for sulfide content.
Serum bound sulfide concentrations were calculated as follows:
bound sulfide = (serum sample sulfide content - dialysate sulfide content) + 10
This compensated for both the ten fold dilution of blood serum and
for the unbound sulfide present in the serum due to free diffusion
across the dialysis membrane.
Results
Both the C. pacifica and the V. gigas serum concentrated sulfide
substantially above ambient levels (Fig. 1). At low external sulfide
concentrations (below 500 UM), all bound sulfide concentrations
