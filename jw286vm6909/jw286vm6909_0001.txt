Sulfide Binding Characteristics of..
Abstract
The sulfide binding characteristics of blood serum were studied inÂ¬
vitro in two deep-sea vesicomyid clams, Calyptogena pacifica and
Vesicomya gigas. Both the C. pacifica and the V. gigas serum
concentrated sulfide at least an order of magnitude above ambient
levels. V. gigas accumulated sulfide faster than C. pacifica,
reaching saturation at 5000 M after an hour. C. pacifica bound
sulfide at half the rate of V. gigas, reaching saturation in about two
hours at a substantially higher concentration of sulfide. The
observed distribution of the animals near cold seeps in the Monterey
Submarine Canyon can be explained by their different sulfide binding
abilities. The hypothesis that cold seeps are actually much more
unstable sources of sulfide than previously assumed is explored.
