Sulfide Binding Characteristics of
maintained for 90 days, I suggest that sulfide binding levels may be
constitutive and species-specific rather than highly regulated,
although this is certainly an area for further experimentation. The
two aspects of sulfide binding discussed in this paper--absolute
level bound and rate of binding--deserve further exploration.
My data suggest that the blood of both species binds sulfide at
least an order of magnitude above ambient levels. However, the two
species differ considerably in binding characteristics. C. pacifica
consistently bound more sulfide than V. gigas when both were
allowed to reach equilibrium at comparable external sulfide
concentrations. In situ, V. gigas inhabits areas of high sulfide
concentration, while C. pacifica is more abundant at sites with
lower sulfide levels (R. E. Kochevar, pers. comm.). As blood binding
of sulfide may be an important defense against sulfide toxicity
(Powell and Somero 1986), elevated sulfide levels may inhibit
aerobic respiration in C. pacifica, while the lower sulfide levels on
which C. pacifica thrives may not be sufficient for V. gigas to
supply adequate sulfide to its symbionts. C. pacifica also survives
better and longer in the laboratory. This may be partially linked to
its ability to bind the lower levels of sulfide characteristic of
aquarium maintenance.
Saturation was evident in V. gigas after an hour and in C. pacifica
after approximately two hours. Rate studies on the blood serum C.
magnifica suggest that it binds sulfide more slowly than the C.
pacifica and V. gigas. Arp et al. (1984) discovered that C. magnifca,
which wedges its foot into hydrothermal vent fissures and is in
close contact with warm, sulfide rich water, appears to accumulate
sulfide in a linear fashion over at least 20 hours. Timed binding
