Sulfide Binding Characteristics of..
studies performed on the sulfide binding hemoglobin of the
vestimentiferan Riftia pachytila suggest continuous sulfide
accumulation until saturation, which occurs after about 16 hours
(Arp and Childress 1983). The sulfide concentrations surrounding
the animals are intermittant, but their vascular blood levels
indicate that substantial quantities of sulfide are availible in their
environments (Arp and Childress 1983). Sulfide binding rates in
both Riftia and C. magnifica are an order of magnitude slower than
the rates observed in C. pacifica and V. gigas.
It has been assumed that the cold seep environment has a low,
steady, continuous flow of sulfide in comparison to the
concentrated, capricious sulfide in hydrothermal vents. In this
scenario it seems that selection would favor high sulfide affinities
with little regard for rapid binding rates. In light of the fact that
the sulfide binding rates in C. pacifica and V. gigas are much higher
than those of the aforementioned hydrothermal vent species, this
may be called into question. One possible explanation of the fast
binding rates of seep animals may be that the sulfide levels of cold
seeps, as well as being lower than those of vents, are highly
variable. Selective pressure would then favor clams that could
concentrate sulfide in large quantities as quickly as possible. This
reconsideration of the seep environment is supported by time lapse
videos of clam fields in which it has been observed that
occasionally, a patch of mud within a clam field will suddenly turn
black and then fade to its normal color over several hours (J. P.
Barry, pers. comm.). These data suggest that the cold seeps may be
more dynamic systems then previously recognized.
