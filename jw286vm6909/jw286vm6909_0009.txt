Sulfide Binding Characteristics of...
hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico. Both animals leave
characteristic trails of up to 205 cm (Rosman et al. 1987). It has
been suggested that this burrowing behavior is necessary to provide
a constant source of sulfide to the clams’ symbionts (Fisher 1990).
As this foraging behavior is not evident in C. pacifica and V. gigas,
the cold seeps must provide sufficient net amounts of sulfide, but
sulfide levels may fluctuate considerably over short temporal
scales.
It is hypothesized that the distribution of C. pacifica and V. gigas
may be in part controlled by their sulfide binding characteristics.
The comparatively rapid sulfide binding evident in the clam serum
suggests that the cold seeps may have ephemeral bursts of sulfide.
This is a radical deviation from current dogma. Further observation
of animals with chemotrophic symbionts in conjunction with studies
of their environments may support the hypothesis that the sulfide
binding characteristics of the animals may be indicative of the
surrounding sulfide availibilities.
