Results
Three intertidal species of hermit crabs were found
in the subtidal area: Pagurus hemphilli, P. hirsutiusculus,
and P. granosimanus. Two other distinct species of Pagurus
were found in the subtidal, but they have yet to be identified.
Using Schmitt's "Key To California Species of Pagurus,
Pylopagurus, and Parapagurus" the two unknowns fit closely
the characteristics for Pagurus setosus and P. californiensis.
However examination of the species description eliminates
the possibility that these are the correct specific names.
Paguristes turgidus and P. bakeri were found in the
deeper part of the sampled area in the subtidal region.
Pagurid glaucothoe residing in shells were found in all
sampled areas. (Bee Fig. 4.)
Pagurus hemphilli and P. (setosus) constituted over
90% of the sampled pagurid population. The former being
more prevalent nearer the intertidal while the latter
was more numerous in the deeper waters. (See Fig. 5.)
Juvenile pagurids always constituted the majority of
the hermit crabs sampled in each area. (See Fig. 6.)
Although hermit crabs were found just about everywhere
in the subtidal, coralline algae proved to be the substrate
on which the paguries concentrated. (See Fig. 7.)
