Discussion
Pagurus hemphilli, which was found by Belknap to
be prevalent in the lower intertidal area, was also very
prevalent throughout the subtidal area. P. hirsutiusculus,
which was numerous throughout the whole intertidal area,
was not found to any great extent in any part of the
subtidal area. This could be indicative of a sudden drop
in population at the intertidal zone or of poor sampling
in one of the surveys.
P. (setosus), which I found throughout the subtidal
area, was not found in the intertidal area by Belknap,
perhaps because it was not recognized (it resembles P.
hirsutiusculus).
Summary
1. Pagurus hemphilli, P. hirsutiusculus, P. granosimanus,
P. (setosus). and P. (californiensis) were found inhabiting
the subtidal region.
2. Paguristes bakeri and P. turgidus were found in
the subtidal region.
3. Large numbers of pagurid glaucothoe were found residing
in shells.
4. Coralline algae is the substrate having the highest
population density of pagurids.
