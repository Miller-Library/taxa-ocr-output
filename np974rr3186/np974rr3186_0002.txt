Introduction
A survey was taken of the pagurid populatien in the
subtidal area in conjunction with the intertidal survey
done by Bob Belknap. I hoped to find the types and numbers
of pagurids found in the subtidal region, and also the
substrates on which the pagurids are found.
Procedure
The procedure followed was that of the intertidal
survey except that all samples were colledted by scooping
up sand with plastic collecting boxes, or by scraping
in the substrate with a diving knife.
Due to the prevalence of a Pagurus species not found
in the intertidal area, a pigmentation chart (See Fig. 1 &
2) was constructed for identifying P. (setosus)" to use
along with John Markhame Pigmentation Chart which I used
for identification of juvenile hermit crabs.
Nine collecting areas were marked out in the subtidal
region. Within each area four substrates were sampled--
open sand, large rocks, crevices found between large rocks,
and small rocks or gravel.
The species name is not known The name in
parenthesis is a closely related species used
as a means of distinguishing the unknown species
of pagurids.
