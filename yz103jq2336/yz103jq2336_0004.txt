mosm). Hypertonic sea water was prepared with 14.61 g Nacl in one liter sea
water then diluted with sea water until osmolality reached 1300 mosm. This
last group was termed the "Hyperosmotic" group.

Threshold Twitch Behavior
Muscles from each group studied, "Full Recovery (Full R), No Recovery
(No R), and Hyperosmotic (Hyp)," respond to a single, brief (0.5 ms)
electrical shock (10 V) with a slow twitch. Time to peak was approximately
3-5 sec and time to half-relaxation 8-14 sec. Amplitudes of these near
threshold twitches are specific for the different groups of muscles.
Responses, measured inmm shortened, are compared in Figure 1 for single 10
V shock with durations varying from 0.5 to 2.0 msec. The Full R group
produced the largest twitches. Comparatively smaller twitches were recorded
from the No R group, and the smallest twitches from the Hyp group.
Figure 2 shows results of an analogous experiment employing 20 V
shocks. Twitches for all groups are larger than those elicited by 10 V
stimuli. Again the Full R group showed greater shortening response than the
other groups. With larger auochs, reugenses of the No R and Ryp groups were
not distinguishable from one another.
Figure 3 illustrates shortening recordings of the three groups during
tetanic stimulation with 20 V shocks at 200 Hz. Time to maximal shortening
ranged from 16 sec to 70 sec for the three groups. Muscles responded with
greatest peak shortening in Full R, but amplitudes were not as distinct from
No R and Hyp group amplitudes as amplitudes were in response to single
shocks. Time to peak did not differ. Relaxation times were very different
