Abstract
The columellar muscle (foot-shell retractor) of the intertidal limpet
Collisella digitalis is responsible for the tenacity with which this limpet
can hold onto rock substrate in response to mechanical stress (i.e. wave
action and predation) (Fretter, 1962).
Consequently, dessication and splash provide great osmotic stress upon
this intertidal limpet. This paper describes the varying excitability and
"catch" characteristics of the foot-shell retractor muscle under varying
osmotic stresses.
