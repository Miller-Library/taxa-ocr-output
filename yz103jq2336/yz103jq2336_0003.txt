MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens were collected from the intertidal zone at Cabrillo Point,
Pacific Grove, California, in the afternoon just before high tide to ensure
that the limpets had been subject to several hours of natural dessication
stress prior to study. Three groups were established. The first was placed
in sea water for five hour to induce isoosmotic conditions simulating
coverage by waves and splash during the high tide cycle. After the five
hour soak period the limpets were removed, and osmolalities of the
extra-corporeal fluid were measured by extraction of fluid with a 20 gauge
syringe and determination by a freezing-point depression osmometer. These
animals constituted the "full recovery" group. The foot-shell columellar
muscle was excised in sections of 3x 1 mm, with both ends intact, and
mounted for shortening experiments in which muscles were stimulated with
single, repetitive, electrical shocks. The electrode consisted of two 3x 4
pieces of platinum foil coated with platinum black. Electrodes were
positioned tranversely within 0.5 mm of the muscle. Electrode pulses were
provided with a Grass S44 stimulator. Shortening (under (1 gram of load)
was measured with a Phipps and Bird Displacement Transducer model ST-2 and
recorded with a Brush Recorder Mark 280.
For the second and third groups extra-corporeal fluid osmolality was
measured immediately after removal from intertidal sites. Muscles were
excised and studied in a manner similar to the first group. Note that
limpets in the second group were bathed in sea water only for the duration
of the experiment and were designated the "No Recovery" group.
The third group was bathed in hypertonic sea water (1300 mosm)
corresponding to the osmolalities of the animals in the field (1200-1400
