(see Figure 3). Results are supported by other experiments and provided in
summary Table 1. Table 1 shows the mean times for maximum shortening, time
to peak, time to half-relaxation and relative osmolarity measurements.
Mean times to half-relaxation are very significant and reveal great
disparity between the three groups. Muscles studied in the hypertonic
medium clearly relax from tetanic stimulation more slowly than muscles from
the other two groups.
Discussion
The differential responses to varying osmotic conditions may indicate a
physical limit on the lower distribution of C. digitalis. The reasoning
behind this idea will be discussed.
Single shock twitches revealed decreased contractility for muscles
subject to high osmotic conditions. Hyp muscles showed markedly lower
twitching in response to even the smallest stimuli, compared to No R and
Full R groups. Specifically No R muscles (prepared in a manner identical to
Hyp muscles (1300 mosm) only being bathed in sea water (970 mosm)) showed
decidedly higher sensitivity to single 10 V shocks.
Based upon these results a limpet's ability to forage and move
locations is likely to be reduced under dessication stress. At the same
time, under near isoosmotic conditions (to sea water) limpet muscle has a
greater ability to shorten. Applied to field situations, this suggests
greater movement or greater ability for movement under near isoosmotic
conditions such as found during high tide compared to low tide dessication.
From behavioral studies it is known that C. digitalis moves actively during
high tide. Consequently, decreased ability for muscle shortening induced by
