Figure 1. Excitability varies with
osmolality. Figure 1 represents displacement
(mm) versus duration (ms) at 10 V shocks.
Note the greater shortening excitability of
f-rec to n-rec and h-osm.
Figure 2. Excitability varies with
osmolality. Figure 2 represents displacement
(mm) versus duration (ms) at 20 V shocks. Note
the greater shortening of f-rec to n-rec and
h-osm.
Figure 3. Hyperosmolality enhances long catch
responses. Comparison of peak to
half-relaxation records for the three groups
(pulse times are specific for the individual
traces). Shortening measurements are mean
values of all members in the separate groups.
Note the great differences in half-relaxation
time for the varying osmolality groups (see
Table 1).
Table 1. Comparitive table of the mean values
of shortening responses and tetanic shortening
characteristics of each group compared with
mean osmolality values of extra-corporeal
fluid. Most important values are the Times to
Half-relaxation.
