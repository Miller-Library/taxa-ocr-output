present study, it is tempting to speculate that the slow rate of
re-extension is analagous to the molluscan "catch" response, in which a
muscle can maintain force for a very long time in the absence of continued
stimulation (Twarog, 1967). Thus re-extension responses, following tetani
in the three groups studied may indicate that osmotic conditions are an
important factor in maintenance of the "catch" state. If these assumptions
are accepted, then limpets in the near isoosmotic condition (to sea water)
of being "Fully Recovered" show a much weaker ability to maintain long
catch" states. Conversely, dessicated animals would find it much easier to
maintain a catch state for long periods and to maintain a firm hold on a
rock.
These effects of osmolality on limpet muscle suggest that limiting
factors C. digitalis encounters in the field could influence distribution
limits. Not only can the limpet be restricted by upper physical boundaries
due to dessication and heat stress, but may also experience lower physical
boundaries in addition to the many biological boundaries. Intriguinaly.
this lower physical limit might involve physiological alterations such as
reduced ability to maintain muscular catch associated with body fluid
osmolalities (isoosmotic with sea water) under high tide conditions.
