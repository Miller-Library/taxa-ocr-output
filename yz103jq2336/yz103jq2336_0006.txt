hyperosmotic conditions tested in this study corresponds to clumping
behavior and decreased movement observed in the field during low tides. The
extent to which behavior is influenced by physiologically suppressed or
enhanced muscles is as yet undetermined and deserves additional study.
Tetanic Responses
Tetani were elicited at shock frequencies of 200 Hz. There were noted
differences between the groups. Maximum shortening responses revealed that
the Full R group shortened the most relative to Hyp group shortening, with
the No R Group shortening least of all. However, this pattern cannot be
regarded as unequivocal due to shortening response being dependent upon size
of limpet tested and due to variability with a small sample size (n-tetanic
- 2/group). Thus although the degree of muscle shortening may be
osmotically dependent, this report cannot conclusively determine this
relationship.
Mean times to peak were recorded during the period of 25 to 33 sec
beginning from time of stimulation. Averages of these data fail to show any
significant differences between the groups.
The greatest difference in the three groups lies in the muscles
ability to maintain the shortened state following tetanic stimulation. The
osmotically stressed group, Hyp, revealed a far greater ability to maintain
a sustained shortened position than either of the other two groups. This
difference amounted to an approximately sixteen-times slower rate of
re-extension than for the lowest osmotically stressed group, Full R.
Hore work is needed to clarify results concerning the time to peak and
maximum shortening response by increasing the number in each sample group.
Further, varying osmolality using a variety of agents in addition to NaCl
will better characterize the muscle. Although force was not measured in the
