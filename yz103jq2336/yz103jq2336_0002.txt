INTRODUCTION
Causes of intertidal zonation for Collisella digitalis and other
Collisella (formerly Acmaea; Lindberg, 1981) of the Central California Coast
have been shown to result from physical as well as biological "limiting
factors." The upper limiting factors for C. digitalis are set by
dessication and temperature tolerances (Carefoot, 1977, Wolcott, 1973).
Lower limiting factors are traditionally thought to be set by biological
factors. These include competition for space and food resources (Haven,
S.B. 1973, 1971) as well as behavioral limitations (Wolcott, 1973). Thus,
physical limiting factors have often been cited in the literature for
limiting upper distribution but apparantly not so for the lower distribution
of C. digitalis. Many recognize this developing concept, that the upper
limits of distribution are physically determined and lower limits determined
by biological factors (Carefoot, 1973, Connell, 1961).
Physically determined lower limits of distribution, however, could
affect C. digitalis. Experiments reported in this paper were designed to
investigate the osmotic stress C. digitalis experiences during low tide
dessication and high tide submersion. The indices of stress used were
contractile properties of the shell-foot retractor muscle under varying
osmotic conditions. This muscle, also called the columellar muscle, is used
by the limpet to hold tenaciously onto rock substrates and must be largely
responsible for the animal's ability to live in exposed areas experiencing
great wave action. This muscle is also responsible for the shell clamp-down
behavior which provides protection from predators (Fretter, 1962).
