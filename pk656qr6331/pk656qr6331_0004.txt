spiral shaped organisms were always found. Sometimes
only a few were found in a preparation, sometimes a
great number. Where they were numerous, three morpho-
logically different types could be distinguished, the
dominant one of which was found alone in less numerous
preparations. Two forms appear to be spirochaetes and
one may be a spirillum. Spirilla were found in great
numbers in some preparations. Several different kinds
of rods grew in abundance on plates from the stomach.
The spiral caecum also has one of the largest
populations of bacteria in Tegula funebralis' gut. One
can see rods and many cocci. In one animal several spiral
forms were also found, although usually this was not the
case. Numerous plates were made of spiral caecum material.
Many types of motile and non-motile rods were found. A
small motile short rod was isolated in large numbers.
Numerous colonies of the cocci were also found, but they
were extremely small, indicating that they did not thrive
under the conditions of culture.
The digestive gland contained rods and cocci, some in
chains of two or three. Plates showed a concentration
of motile rods of the same or similar types.
The thin walled hindgut had less bacteria than the
midgut area. It contained the same forms in general; in
one case it also contained some spirilla and spirochaete
forms. Plates revealed a few rods.
Motile rods were found in the rectum in good numbers.
Spirilla may also be present.
