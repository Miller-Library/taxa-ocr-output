ground intestinal tract prepared in a manner identical to
that prepared in his estimates.
Environment
In order to understand at least one variable of the
internal environment of these micro-organisms, attempts
were made to measure the hydrogen ion concentration. This
was accomplished by dissecting each section of the tract
out dry, placing it on a slide, cutting it open, and
inserting Nitrazine Paper (E.R. Squibb & Sons). The
results are given in Table I. It was not possible, however,
to determine the pH of the digestive gland by this
method.
DISCUSSION
Some new information about these micro-organisms has
been noted here. The data indicates, first, that most of
the micro-organisms are found in the midgut region of the
stomach, spiral caecum, and digestive gland. Second, the
most abundant organism seen microscopically was a coccus.
The role these organisms play in relation to their host is
difficult to interpret. It is also difficult to decide
whether all represent constant components of the microÂ¬
organism flora. Some may simply have been ingested by a
Tegula funebralis.
The constant occurrence of the spiral organisms in
large numbers found primarily in the stomach suggests
