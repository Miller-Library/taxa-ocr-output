2. Spiral Forms.
The spiral organisms found have not previously been
described. Two were thought to be spirochaetes on the
basis of their flexibility and tendency to form irregular
shapes. Smaller, more rigid forms, with a corkscrew
type of motility were distinguished in some cases and
thought to be spirilla. They were seen regularly in the
stomach and rarely outside. They have never been found
anterior to the stomach.
Two of the morphologically different types were placed
tentatively in the order Spirochaetales (Buchanan, 1918).
They belong to the family Spirochaetaceae (Swellengrebel,
1907), being placed there by size. They belong either
to the genus Spirochaeta (Ehrenberg, 1833) or the genus
Saprospira (Gross, 1911), which are differentiated by
Saprospira's periplast membrane and cross striations.
These features were difficult to ascertain in an
unstained wet mount.
One form that was in the minority was seen only
rarely. A few cells were found of about the same length
as the dominant one, the cell width thinner, with many
more waves along the cell. The spirilla form was about
half the length of the dominant form and had one to one
and a half waves along its body.
The dominant type ranged in size from 30 to 70 microns
with a mean at about 50 microns. It had 2 to 4 waves with
a mean wave length of 15 microns and mean spiral depth
