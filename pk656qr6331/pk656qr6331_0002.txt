INTRODUCTION
Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854), like many animals,
harbors a great many micro-organisms of different types
in its digestive tract. Very little is known about
these organisms and their relationship to their host,
their distribution in the tract, their density and type,
and their function within the organism. Galli (1956)
describes the eubacteria that he could culture and did
intensive studies on the digestive properties of five
selected rod-shaped bacteria. He mentioned little about
factors of distribution, density, or types actually seen
in the digestive tract.
This paper deals with the gross properties of the
micro-organisms found in the digestive tract of Tegula
funebralis, based on examinations of the material found
in the lumen as well as on observations of organisms
growing on plates. It also deals with one factor of the
environment in the digestive tract, namely the hydrogen
ion concentration.
