SUMMARY
The digestive tract of a gastropod was examined to
determine type, location, and density of micro-organisms.
Digestive contents were examined microscopically and
streaked onto media. The center of density was the stomach,
spiral caecum and digestive gland area, where abundant
yeast cells were seen and numerous rod-shaped bacteria
cultured. Cocci were seen most abundantly throughout,
although rarely cultured. Spiral organisms, thought to be
two spirochaetes and a spirillum, were found in the
stomach and described. The pH of the gut varied from 6.5
to 7.5.
