Yeasts
The intestinal contents were examined microscopically
for yeast. Yeast cells were observed in medium density in
the stomach, in high density with many budding cells in the
spiral caecum, and in medium density in the digestive gland.
They were only rarely observed in any other part of the
digestive tract.
Numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to culture
these yeasts. Cultures were inoculated from suspensions
of the intestinal contents streaked onto plates. The
pH of the medium was varied from 4 to 8 in an attempt to
discourage bacterial growth and encourage yeast growth.
Cultures were incubated botheaerobically and anaerobically.
Liquid media were tried in addition to agar plates.
In
addition, material was streaked on the medium used by
Galli (1956 ), who stated that he had obtained five
varieties of marine yeast from the intestinal tract of
Tegula funebralis.
There could be many reasons why no yeasts were
observed in culture. The yeast forms so commonly observed
may be different from those that Galli (1956 ) isolated.
He did not mention how frequently they were isolated.
Another relevant factor in this attempt is that the
number of micro-organisms in the pieces of the alimentary
tract was considerably less than those reported by
Galli (1956), as was indicated by two dilution series of
