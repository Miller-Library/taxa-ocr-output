that they may be regular inhabitants of the digestive
tract. Spirochaetes of the genus Cristispira (Gross, 1910)
have been described from the intestinal tracts of
lamellibranchs. These are fairly large spirochaetes
with a characteristic ridge or crista which serves as the
axial filament, running longitudinally and making a couple
of turns around the body. Their normal habitat is the
crystalline style of lamellibranchs, although they have
been seen elsewhere in the tract (Bergey's Manual, 1957).
They do not appear to harm their hosts (Hawker, et.al;
1960). The Cristispira must have one or several unique
requirements, since they usually live isolated from the
rest of the gut in the style sac. Their nutritional
requirements are unknown. They have never been cultured;
in this respect they are like most other spirochaetes,
which are very difficult to culture.
The spirochaetes in Tegula funebralis may represent
similar commensals. They too are reasonably restricted
to one part of the digestive tract and live in an area
of rich, semi-digested material.
The internal environment of Tegula funebralis is
very complex. A wide variety of food materials pass
through the gut, giving a collection of varied nutrients
difficult to access. Another factor, the hydrogen ion
concentration, varies over a range of one pH unit and is
generally higher than sea water. The bacteria cultured
grow well on media ranging in pH from 5.5 to 8.0.
