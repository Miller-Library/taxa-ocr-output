MEDIA
Two basic types of media were first used. One
contained 1.5% agar, 0.1% glucose, 0.05% yeast extract,
and 50% sea water; the other contained 1.5% agar, 1.0%
1.0% yeast extract, and 50% sea water. Both O.01%
aqueus extract of Tegula funebralis and a similar extract
of the alga, Iridaea, were added to some media as a
possible growth factor supplement. The enriched media
used by Galli (1956 ), salsod, was used.
METHODS AND RESULTS
Bacteria
1. Density and Distribution.
Alimentary contents were examined as wet mounts
under a phase contrast microscope to determine type and
relative density. This was supplemented by studies of
types growing from different parts of the digestive
tract on the media.
The anterior esophagus showed no obviously motile
forms with microscopic examination. Forms resembling
cocci were found either singly or in irregular clumps of
cells, but were not very numerous. One or two colonies
of different types of motile rods appeared on plates.
The lower esophagus showed the same kinds of
organisms and density under the microscope.
The population of bacteria increased sharply in the
stomach. The coccus form was very abundant. In addition,
