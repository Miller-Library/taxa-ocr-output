-3-
cm. of sand was dyed with toluylene blue, the layer one cm.
below with neutral red, and undyed sand was below two cm.;
the sand grains retained their dyed color and the dyes did
not seem to be deleterious to the worms. Ten worms were
placed in each container and allowed to burrow, the
containers then were placed in a tank filled with continually
running sea water. After 72 hours, the worms were hand
washed to remove the sand particles sticking to their bodies
and placed in filtered sea water. Phase microscopic
observations of the sand grains in the feces were carried
out after defecation.
The Walkley and Black wet oxidation method for organic
carbon content (Piper, 1944) was used for comparison of the
sand and feces. This method gives only a 75 percent
recovery for organic carbon content, so the experimental
results were multiplied by a factor of 1.3 to obtain the
actual (true) organic carbon content and then by the Trask
factor of 1.8 to obtain the total organic matter (Morgans, 1956).
Sand was collected from only the top 2-3 cm. from three
locations at the Yacht Harbor:
A- high intertidal
B- mid intertidal
C- always covered by water
Areas B and C were abundant with C. spirabrancha whereas
area A lacked them. The sand was washed well with distilled
water in a gooch crucible to remove salts and oven-dried
at 100-105Â° C. to constant weight. The sand was then passed
through a O.589 mm Tyler screen and approximately 2 gram
