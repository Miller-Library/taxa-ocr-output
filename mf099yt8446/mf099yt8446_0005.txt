Ten worms were planted in the containers with layers
of colored sand for 72 hours. They defecated within 24 hours
after transfer to filtered sea water. The feces contained
both red and blue sand grains from the top two cm levels.
A few colorless sand grains from below two om also appeared
among the feces. These, however, might have been some of
the sand grains attached to the tentacles by mucus when the
worms were first placed in the dish. They could not be
removed without injurying the worm. The worms did burrow
in the white sand that formed the bottom layer of the
container, so there remains the possibility that the
worms do feed below two cm from the surface.
No precise feeding- turnover rates could be established.
Times from feeding until defecation varied from one to two
and a half hours. Part of the problem in determining
turnover rates, as shown by the gut dissections, involves
the indefinite length of time the worms hold food in the
posterior part of the gut. C. spirabrancha does not seem
to defecate only when feeding because it will defecate in
filtered sea water within twelve hours. During timed runs
for rate determinations the sampling dissections showed that
the worms were ingesting the substrate, but no correlation
between the length of time the worms were allowed to feed
and the time elasped before the feces appeared could be
found. Moreover, no actual ingestion of substrate could
be seen even though substrate particles were later found
in the hind gut. Since no definite time of feeding could
be established, rates were impossible to determine.
