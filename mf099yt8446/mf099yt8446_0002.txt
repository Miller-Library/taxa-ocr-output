feces, as well as microscopic observations, reported in
this paper indicate that C. spirabrancha feed selectively
from the substrate.

Materials and Methods:
Specimens of C. spirabrancha were collected every two
to three days during low tide in the mud-flats of the
Monterey Yacht Harbor and kept in tanks of running sea water
in the laboratory. Dissections of the gut of fresh worms
were done to determine gut content and whether the worm
actually ingested sand grains. Attempts at rate determinations
were also made by starving fresh worms in sea water without
any substrate for six hours and placing them in colored
sand or minute glass beads enriched with bacteria (which
was cultivated by leaving the glass beads in finger bowls
overnight with sea water and small amount of yeast extract
and glucose) for varying fifteen minute intervals. The worms
were then hand washed and placed in millipore filtered
(pore size of .45/) sea water until defecation occurred.
To establish the approximate level of feeding, containers
were set up with three layers of fine sand, the upper one
