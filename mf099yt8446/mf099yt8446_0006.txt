The fecal pellets always contained large amounts of
mucus that enmeshed clumps of organic detritus and bacteria.
Organic analysis of the sand and feces indicated that there
was more organic matter in the feces than in the substrate
(Table I); the percentage of organic matter in the feces
varied widely, but all values were higher than those of
available organic matter in the substrate. The values
in the feces were high even when substrate A was used in
the feeding dishes. Substrate A may have been enriched
during feeding by the continual supply of fresh sea water
flowing into the tank where the finger bowls of substrate
and worms were kept during feeding time, providing the
extra organic material. Possibly bacteria grew on the
collected feces although precautions were taken to
keep the collecting containers covered, the temperature
between 13-15Â° C., and the defecating worms were placed
in millipore filtered sea water to remove bacteria and
organic debris.
In both the field and in the laboratory, the tentacles
were observed to hold onto small pieces of algae. In the
laboratory there was definite tentacle activity associated
with kelp; the tentacles responded immediately to floating
pieces (approximately two cm square) of kelp by wrapping
around them and holding them to the surface of the sand.
Usually only the tentacles were above the sand surface
while the rest of the worm's body remained buried one
to two om below the surface. Furthermore, often these
