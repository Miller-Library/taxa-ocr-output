sorting occurred. Jones (1968) noticed an immediate response
of the tentacles of Magelona sp. when a mass of detritus
was placed in contact with them. The tentacles of this
species made a loop, allowing the material to fall directly
to the mouth. Courtney (1958) remarked on the possibility
of food passing from the tentacular groove of C. tentaculata
to the mouth, although she never observed this phenomenon
directly. The vertical position of the long tentacles
in the environment makes the tentacles likely tools for
bringing food materials from the surface down near the
mouth region. In fact, MacGinitie (1935) reported that
C. spirabrancha feeds by extending its tentacles onto the
surface of the substrate to draw detritus into the opening
of the burrow where it is taken in by the mouth of the
animal. The present work further suggests that this worm
feeds on disintegrating organic material, and the tentacles
could play a major role in the feeding of this food material.
The holding of algae by the tentacles and the presence of
-carotene in the gut contents (found by the use of the
spectometer, J. Hult, personal comm.) strongly supports
the possibility that algae are especially important
as a food source.
