small pieces were slowly pulled into the sand until they
were completely buried.
Discussion:
The results from the feeding level experiments indicate
that C. spirabrancha feeds primarily in the upper two cm
of the substrate. The interface between the grey-white
surface substrate and the black sand-mud in which
C. spirabrancha lives is at about two to three cm;
C. spirabrancha probably feeds mainly in the grey-white
sand substrate. Courtney (1958) also suggested that the
species C. tentaculata feeds from the surface layers because
diatoms which live on the surface were in the gut and feces.
In addition, sea water contains much organic debris (Fox, 1950)
which deposits on the surface layers and adsorbs to the
substrate particles.
As Flattely (1916) suggested with C. tentaculata,
MacGinitie suggested that C. spirabrancha selects
nutritive materials rather than merely ingests substrate
particles indiscrimately. The high values of organic
content found in the feces compared to those found in the
substrate support this conclusion. Further substantiation
of the feeding selectivity is shown by the high content
of organic detritus and bacteria in the fecal pellets
with comparatively few sand grains; if C. spirabrancha
is a non-selective substrate feeder like Arenicola, more
sand grains would be expected in the feces. The mud-flats
