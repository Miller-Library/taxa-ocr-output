Abstract
The cirratulid polychaete Cirriformia spirabrancha
living in intertidal regions which are rich in
organic detritus has been studied. Results from
the studies on the feeding of this worm indicate
that C. spirabrancha is a selective feeder on
organic detritus, especially from algae that is
in the surface layers. Mucus production and
probable tentacle activity seem important in
food collection.
Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore, 1904) occurs in
abundance in the intertidal regions of the Monterey Bay
beaches. These worms live primarily in noxious, black
mud or fine sand which contains high concentrations of
sulfates and organic matter. C. spirabrancha seem to abound
in areas where organic decay is high. Organic detritus
has been shown to be an important food source for many
inshore animals (Fox, 1950), and may be of similar im-
portance to this species.
Courtney (1958) reported that C. tentaculata in
England feeds mainly from the surface layers. George (1964)
gave evidence that this species is a non-selective substrate
feeder feeding on organic debris adsorbed to sand particles.
However, a much earlier investigation of C. tentaculata
(Flattely, 1916) suggested that this worm, unlike
Arenicola, does not simply live by passing sand through
its gut, but rather it selects nutritive organic particles
from the substrate. The quantitative analysis of sand and
