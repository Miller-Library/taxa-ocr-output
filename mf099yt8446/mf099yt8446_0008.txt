where C. spirabrancha lives are rich in decaying organic
material and are exposed daily to wave action which
proabably breaks down disintegrating organic materials
into minute particles.
The mucus covered fecal pellets and material in the
gut suggests that this worm feeds by mucous entrapment
of its food. The presence of many mucous cells in the
fore gut (Courtney, 1958) and the lack of teeth support
the idea of such a feeding mechanism. In fact, C. spirabrancha
seems to secrete mucus from its entire body and this
secretion of mucus could be a means for gathering organic
detritus. The polychaete Chaetoptus variopedatus has
been shown (Franklin, 1931) to feed in this manner, secreting
mucus and then ingesting the mucus and whatever material
has been entrapped in it. The mucus in the feces could
account for part of their high organic content, but the
worm must still produce more mucus to replace that which
is defecated; the need to produce moremmucus would require
a high intake of organic material. The rich organic
content of the feces together with the seeming aggregation
of this worm (Smith, 1968) points to the possible
importance of coprophagy as found in some other marine
animals (Frankenburg, 1967).
Tentacle activity around kelp suggests a possible
role of the tentacles in feeding. In his work on terebellid
polychaetes, Dales (1955) found that feeding was effected
by the tentacles bringing particles to the lips where
