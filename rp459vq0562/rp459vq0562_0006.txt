Sandy-lobed Ascidians

embryos in the atrium. Synoicum parfustis has the greatest capacity for
brooding embryos of the three species by carrying up to 13 developing
embryos.
Field studies
The second phase of the project was conducted to see if any distributional
differences could be seen between the three species.
Methods:
From collection of specimens, the general area where lobes occurred
was known. Fourteen areas were then selected for study on the basis of
surf exposure, depth, and the presence of at least one of the three ascidian
species being studied. Abundance and distribution of each species was observed
in each area from the zero tide level to the ocean floor.
Each area was divided into three ranges of depth below the zero tide
level: +0.25 to -0.25 m,-0.25 to -0.75m and -0.75 to -1.0 meters. The
zero tide level was determined using a meter stick and the Monterey Bay
tide charts and measuring the zero tide level from the height of the low
tide.
The abundance of each species in each area and depth was measured
on a scale of 0 (species not present), 1 (species present), 2 (species
present in good amount), or 3 (species present in large amount).
Results:
General patterns of distribution are shown in Figure 10. Synoicum
parfustis occurs lower down in the areas studied, A. arenatum and A. propinquum
higher up. A. arenatum was not as abundant as either Synoicum parfustis
or A. propinquum. Looking at Table 1., the environments for Figure 10.,
further information is revealed about distribution. Synoicum parfustis
