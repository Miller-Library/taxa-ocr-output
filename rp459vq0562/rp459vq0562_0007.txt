Sandy-lobed Ascidians
Mulroy, W.
grew best in protected areas of moderate surf and on horizontal surfaces
in the lower portion of the depth studied. A. propinquum grew best in
exposed areas with horizontal or vertical surfaces, while A. arenatum
grew best in exposed areas on horizontal surfaces.
Discussion:
From the studies on distribution a logical question follows: what
are the advantages of being a sandy-lobed, colonial tunicate? One advantage
is in space competition. These compound ascidians are benthic organisms.
By having only a stalk attached to the substratum most of the tunicate's
mass is out in the free-flowing water. The lobe shape allows more individuals
per given area of substratum, and prevents the organism from being as
easily overgrown by flat colonial tunicates or sponge as an encrusting
colony might be. Since the tunicates are filter-feeders, a lobe sticking
out from the substratum may get better circulation of water and thus more
food. Finally, the hard sand encrustation protects the tunic from abrasion
in the surf as well as discouraging predators. With these advantages in
gare
mind, the distribution of the three species can, be explained.
The distribution of Aplidium arenatum and A. propinquum higher up
and in heavier surf as compared to Synoicum parfustis appears to be related to
the morphological differences between the species. A. arenatum and A.
propinquum form tightly packed clusters; the lobes are smaller than in
Synoicum parfustis and are more heavily sand encrusted. These characteristics
provide more protection from the heavyy surf and from desiccation at low
tide. Synoicum parfustis on the other hand, form loose clustering colonies
which doe√© not allow the individual lobes to support each other in the
heavy surf or to retain water in the cluster at low tide. The large size
