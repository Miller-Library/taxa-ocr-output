Sandy-lobed Ascidians
different were collected from the intertidal zone. The organisms were
then placed in bowls of seawater, relaxed overnight with menthol, then
fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours. Only well-expanded zooids in which all
rows of stigmata were clearly visible were used for detailed study.
Measurements of zooids and lobes were made with a Vernier caliper.
Results:
A quantitative measure of shape of the lobes is provided by plotting the
height of a lobe against the area of the lobe top (greatest width of the
lobe multiplied by the greatest thickness) for many lobes of each species,
The results are shown in Figurel. and original data are tabulated in Appendix
A. Aplidium arenatum has the smallest and thinnest lobes of the three species.
The largest lobe measured 35 mm in length. A. propinquum lobes reach 50
mm in length and are more plump than those of A. arenatum. Synoicum parfustis
lobes reach the greatest size. Note the overlap in size and shape of
the three species in the smaller lobe size range. Clearly, other characteristics
must be studied for identification.
Another value showing some differences between species is the number
of systems per lobe (Figure 2.). A small area at the top of the lobe allows
only a small number of systems. On the graph note that the 7+ category
of the number of systems includes both A. arenatum whose maximum value
was 8 systems in a lobe and Synoicum parfustis which commonly had over
12 systems in a large lobe. In the area range of 50-200 mmâ€™, A. propinquum
and Synoicum parfustis have similar values.
Figure 3. compares area of the lobe top with the total number of
zooids in the lobe. A. arenatum never had more than 27 zooids in the lobes
studied. In Synoicum parfustis large lobes have well over 100 zooids.
