Sandy-lobed Ascidians
Mulroy, W.
Several species of compound ascidians in which the colonies form
sandy lobes occur near the Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific Grove, California.
They are so similar that species identification in the field and even in
the laboratory may be difficult. The original descriptions of these species
bring out more similarities between them then differences. Van Name (1945)
described Aplidium arenatum as forming irregularly club-shaped lobes thickly
encrusted and impregnated with sand, the top of the lobes in a cluster
fitting together to form an even surface. He found that lobe height reached
25 mm but was usually less than 5mm. Aplidium propinquum was described by
Van Name (1945) as irregularly club-shaped lobes similar to A. arenatum,
although reaching a greater height. Ritter and Forsyth (1917) described the
external appearance of Synoicum parfustis as sand-encrusted, club-shaped
masses having a peduncle twice as long as the rounded head. The height of
an individual lobe reaching 6 cm.
In addition to the similarity in appearance, all three species are
distributed in the low intertidal zone. The zooids all have three body
regions and form systems in a transparent, common test. Positive identification
requires studying such details of zooid structure as the contour of the
stomach wall and the number of rows of stigmata in the pharynx.
The objective of this study was to describe the range in variation for
each species, both in external characteristics of the lobes and in zooid
characteristics, to make identification easier in the field and in the
laborator)
