Sandy-lobed Ascidians
Mulroy, W.
Although A. propinquum lobes do not have as many zooids as large lobes
of Synoicum parfustis, zooids are more densely packed in a given area.
Figure 4. displays the number of zooids per system. Aplidium arenatum
averaged 5.4 zooids per system, and lobes containing one zooid were unique
to A. arenatum. Most systems of Synoicum parfustis had between 6-8 zooids.
In A. propinquum, with an average of 10.8 zooids per system and as many
as 15 zooids in one system, the individuals are more densely packed than
in the other species.
The variation in size and shape of lobes of each species is compared
in Figure 5. From observations made on each species the external appearance
of the lobes in clusters is as follows:
Aplidium arenatum is a small, brown, slender lobe occurring in tightly
packed clusters. The small size, heavy sand-encrustation and flat lobe
tops give the cluster top the appearance of a continuous mound. Sand
not only encrusts the outside of the common test but is loosely spread
throughout the inside also.
Aplidium propinquum forms more plump lobes and larger clusters than
A. arenatum. The lobes range up to 50 mm in height although 30 mm is more
common. The heavy sand encrustation gives way to the transparent tunic
at the bright orange-red, common cloacal aperture, giving the system opening
a distinctive crater-like appearance.
Synoicum parfustis described by Abbott and Newberry (1980) as clusters of
orange, tear-drop shaped lobes are unmistakable when they attain this shape
in well-developed lobes. Smaller lobes are not as distinctively shaped;
however the heads are still more rounded than flat-topped, and the bright
orange systems can be seen in life.
