Sandy-lobed Ascidians
Mulroy, W.
Abstract
The similarities in external morphology and distribution have made
distinction between Aplidium arenatum, Aplidium propinquum and Synoicum
parfustis difficult in the field and laboratory. Quantitative differences
have been found between the species in: height and area of the lobe top;
the shape, color, and clustering of lobes; the number of systems per lobe;
the number of zooids per lobe; the number of zooids per system; zooid size
the number of rows of stigmata; the number of developing embryos in the
atrium; and habitat.
