I woull like to thank Don Abbott for his enthusiasm and guidance
which made this project so enjoyable. Special thanks goes to Keith Kohatsu,
the best T.A. ever. And finally my gratitude must be expressed to all the
students in the spring class, the faculty and the rest of the staff who
make Hopkins such a special place.
