Sandy-lobed Ascidians
Mulroy, W.
The growth of the lobes of each species is also reflected in Figure
5. A. arenatum, A. propinquum, and Synoicum parfustis all form new lobes
from the bases of existing lobes. All three species can add to the area
of a lobe top by increasing the number of systems in the same lobe head.
A. arenatum and A. propinquum have a third method of growth, branching of
a lobe. A new system may form and split the lobe top forming two heads.
This lobe branching adds to the tight clustering of the colonies,
Figure 6. compares the zooids of each species. The drawings, taken
from Van Name (1945), show the number of rows of stigmata and the contour
of the stomach wall. It is the zooids which give the lobes their characteristic
color. The oral and atrial siphons of A. arenatum are brown. The brown
coloring fades to a transparent thorax. In A. propinquum the thorax is
a bright orange-red color, and in Synoicum parfustis it is bright orange.
Figure 7. displays the variation found in the number of rows of stigmata
for each species. A. arenatum always has 5 rows of stigmata. A. propinquum
has 15-21 rows of stigmata, while Synoicum parfustis has 10-16 rows.
All counts were made on well-expanded zooids in which the number of rows
could be counted accurately.

In Figure 8., species are compared with respect tozooid. Since the
length of the post-abdomen is too variable, the combined length of the
thorax and abdomen was used as a measure of size in well-expanded zooids.
A. arenatum was the smallest, maximum length 6 mm. The largest zooid of
A. propinquum is 9 mm. Synoicum parfustis has the largest zooids with some
reaching over 12 mm in length of thorax and abdomen combined.
Figure 9. shows the number of developing embryos found in brooding
zooids. A. arenatum and A. propinquum showed comparable numbers of developing
