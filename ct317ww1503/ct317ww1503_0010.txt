of the hermit crabs had L.asmi aboard. Of the total T.funebralis collected in area 1
(rocky intertidal habitat), 6.2% had a L.asmi on their shells. Three other species of
limpets (L.strigatella, L.limatula, and L.gigantea) and C.adunca were also found on
the hermit crabs' shells.
Laboratory Studies: From using the first set of matrices (Figures 2-5) for tanks #1-44,
it is clear that the mean number of different limpets is highest on each snail (8.3),
whereas the mean number of different limpets on each crab was 6 and the mean
number on rock and glass was 2.4. The mean number of times snails had limpets
aboard was 17.2, for crabs it was 9.7 and for the rock and glass it was 4.3. The mean
number of total different snails ridden by each limpet was 12.5 (83%) and the mean
number of total different crabs ridden by each limpet was 3 (60%). The mean total
number of transfers between snails by each limpet was 28.6 (for 30 day study) and 22.9
(for 20 day study). The mean total number of transfers between crabs by each limpet
was 5.8 (for 30 day study) and 3.9 (for 20 day study). The mean total number of
transfers between all substrates was 35.5 (for 30 day study) and 27.3 (for 20 day study).
The second set of matrices (Figures 6-9) allow for some more calculations to be
obtained for tanks f1-44. The mean total "limpet days" for each snail was 17 out of
30 (57%) and 11.5 out of 20 (58%). Therefore about 43% of the snails had no limpets
on them at any given time. The mean total "limpet days" for each crab was 7.2 out
of 30 (24%). and 4.8 out of 20 (24%). The mean total "limpet days" for each rock and
glass is 4.6 out of 30 (15%) and 2.1 out of 20 (11%).
A linear regression of total number of days each T.funebralis had limpets aboard
and each T.funebralis' surface area showed practically no correlation between the
variables (r2 = 0.166, Figure 15).
