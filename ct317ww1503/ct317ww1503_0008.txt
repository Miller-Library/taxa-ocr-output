Field Studies: The percent T.funebralis with limpets and/or Cadunca appears to
vary from habitat to habitat in this study (Figure 10). At first glance, it looks like the
frequency of limpets and/or C.adunca is highest in the sandy beach habitat (area 2),
yet when these bars are broken down into the percent T.funebralis with just
Cadunca and the percent T.funebralis with just limpets, it is clear that the sandy
beach habitat has a higher percentage of T.funebralis with C.adunca. When the
percentage T.funebralis with limpets in various habitats is compared, it looks quite
similar in all three, although there does seem to be a slightly smaller percentage of
T.funebralis with limpets in area 1.
A closer look at the various species of limpets found on T.funebralis reveals some
more patterns (Figure 11). Nine different species of epizoic limpets were found to
reside on T.funebralis in the three habitats studied. The various limpets found
were: L.asmi, L.digitalis, L.gigantea, L.limatula, L.pelta, L.strigatella, L.triangularis
MacClintockia scabra, and Tectura scutum. L.asmi was found to be the most
abundant limpet on T.funebralis in all three habitats. The abundance of L.asmi is
highest in area 1 and this is the only time area 1 has the highest abundance of a
particular commensal gastropod. Area 2 has the highest abundance of C.adunca and
L.strigatella. Area 3 has the biggest diversity of limpets and the highest abundance of
the seven other species of limpets. L.pelta was only found in areas 2 and 3.
T.scutum and L.triangularis were only found in area 3. L.asmi was the only limpet
of adult size seen on T.funebralis. All the other species of limpets on T.funebralis
were juveniles. The smallest limpets of these species were seen on T.funebralis
