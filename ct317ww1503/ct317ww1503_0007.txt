substrate. These matrices were then used to further quantify and graph the data. To
calculate the mean number of days a particular limpet and substrate were associated.
each cell from the first set of matrices was divided by its corresponding cell in the
second set of matrices. The difference between certain moves were tested for
statistical significance using a two-tailed t-test.
The surface area of the T.funebralis shells was computed using the same formula
as in the field studies:
total surface area = m + rs.
