Discussion
The percentage of T.funebralis with just limpets on their shells was quite similar
in the various habitats, but the percentage of T.funebralis with just Cadun√ßa on
their shells was definitely larger in the protected sandy beach area with rock outcrops
(Figure 10). This result is to be expected following the study done by Yokoe (1980),
who indicated that juvenile Cadunca are most abundant in sandy, shell-fragmented
areas. These young C.adunca attach themselves to juvenile T.funebralis, living in
sandy, lower habitats. These young hosts provide some protection against the strong
water currents and also protection against desiccation since they are almost
constantly submerged.
The abundance and diversity of various species of limpets in different areas was
not similar (Figure 11). Nine different species of limpets were found to inhabit the
shell of T.funebralis. Seven of these species had been observed previously on
T.funebralis (Brewer, 1975). The two new species, found for the first time on
T.funebralis, were: L.gigantea and L.triangularis.
Area 1, the protected rocky intertidal, had the highest frequency of L.asmi
occuring on T.funebralis, but L.asmi is the only species of limpet that occured most
frequently in this habitat. Actually L.asmi was the limpet which occured most often
on T.funebralis in all three habitats, contrary to what Brewer (1975) found in her
study. There may be some sort of interspecific competition which controls the
distribution and abundance of limpets on T.funebralis. It would be interesting to
remove L.asmi from the T.funebralis shells in area 1 to see if the frequency of
various species of limpets changed at all. At the present, it appears that L.asmi tends
