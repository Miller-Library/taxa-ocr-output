to dominate on T.funebralis which would be expected since it is the only adult
limpet to reside on this host. The color of L.asmi is such that it is well camouflaged
when on T.funebralis. This may give L.asmi an added advantage over other species
of limpets whose shell coloring makes them more easily visible to predators. An
experiment testing this hypothesis might be to study the differential rates of
survivability of various limpets on T.funebralis in an area with a great abundance of
potential visual predators.
In the sandy beach habitat, area 2, C.adunca and L.strigatella were most commonly
noted on T.funebralis. Although this habitat was the one with the highest frequency
of L.strigatella (20.9%), it still did not come close to that of L.asmi (38.6%). McLean's
(1966) observations in Pacific Grove did not match my numerical data as he thought
that L.strigatella occured as abundantly as L.asmi on T.funebralis in the same habitat.
Overall the habitats, L.asmi represents 44% of the gastropod commensals on Tegula,
while L.strigatella represents 15%.
Area 3, the wave exposed, steep, and rocky habitat, had the greatest diversity of
limpets on its T.funebralis inhabitants. This area's T.funebralis carried every species
of limpet found in the study and C.adunca. It also had the highest frequency of
every type of limpet except L.asmi and L.strigatella. Limpets in this highly stressful
habitat probably seek out the protection offered to them by their host. T.funebralis
are thought to act as shock absorbers for the limpets against incoming waves (Test,
A., 1946). During times of heavy surge, this snail has been observed to move down
rocks to protected areas, a habit which would also shield epizoic limpets from
crashing water (Daniel, 1978). T.funebralis offers these small limpets much
protection in an otherwise perilous habitat.
In this study, T.funebralis was once again seen to serve as a microhabitat for
