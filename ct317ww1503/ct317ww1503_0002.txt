Introduction
Many studies have addressed the commensal relationship between L. asmi and T.
funebralis (ohnson et al, 1927; Test, F., 1945; Test, A., 1946; Radford, 1959; Eikenberry
& Wickizer, 1964; Alleman, 1968). L.asmi is a small, tall limpet with a dark
brown/black shell. A fairly large specimen would measure about 11 mm. long, 8
mm. high. This limpet forages on algal epiphytes that grow on T.funebralis shells
(McLean, 1966; Ricketts, Calvin, & Hedgpeth, 1985). T.funebralis is an abundant
intertidal snail in central California, found from the mean lower low water (MLLW)
to 1.5 m. above MLLW (Hines et al, 1981). L.asmi is the only true limpet to grow
from juvenile to adult size on T.funebralis, but it is not the only epizoic limpet on
this host. Juvenile limpets found on T.funebralis in California are: Lottia digitalis,
Lottia limatula, Lottia pelta, Lottia strigatella, MacClintockia scabra, and Tectura
scutum (Brewer, 1975; Ricketts, Calvin, & Hedgpeth, 1985). T.funebralis is also often
found with Crepidula adunca, the hooked slipper snail, aboard its shell (Ricketts,
Calvin, & Hedgpeth, 1985). Test (1945) reported that L.asmi was most frequently
found on the body whorl of T.funebralis and rarely seen on hermit crab shells.
McLean (1966) reported that juvenile L.strigatella occured as frequently on
T.funebralis as L.asmi in the same habitat at Pacific Grove, California.
My field study examines the abundance of limpet species and Cadun√ßa on
T.funebralis in three different habitats at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
California. The sizes of L.asmi and its gastropod hosts were recorded. The position
of L.asmi on T.funebralis was noted and the frequency of L.asmi on hermit crabs in
T.funebralis shells was also studied.
