One collection of T.funebralis and Pagurus living in Tfunebralis shells was done
from fide pools in area 1. All commensal gastropods were counted and the epizoic
limpets were identified to species.
The surface area of the T.funebralis shells was calculated by using the equation
described by Lindberg (1990) with a slight modification. The surface area of the shell
base was included in the calculations of this study because this region was found to
be the area of the shell that was most frequently used by the L.asmi. The lateral
surface area of T.funebralis shells was estimated by a cone:
lateral surface area = ars
where r = the radius of the shell base and s = the slant height of the shell. Values
was found by solving the following equation for the hypotenuse of a right triangle
52-12452
where b = shell height. The surface area of the base was estimated by a circle, so the
total surface area of T.funebralis shells was estimated by the following equation:
total surface area = mr+ + ars.
Laboratory Studies: Thirty T.funebralis, twenty L.asmi, ten Pagurus in T.funebralis
shells and two algae covered rocks were collected at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California on April 29, 1991. Each of the organisms was carefully marked
with a numbered square of waterproof paper (about 2 mm x 2 mm) glued to the apex
of their shells. The snail and limpet shells were measured as in the field study.
These limpets were then randomly placed on T.funebralis shells. Fifteen
T.funebralis, ten L.asmi, five Pagurus, and one rock were each placed in two indoor
aquaria. These aquaria were set up to have running, filtered, and aerated seawater
pass through them at all times. Tank#l was set up to have a low tide situation
