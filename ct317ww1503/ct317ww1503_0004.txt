Materials and Methods
Field Studies: Epizoic limpets on Tegula funebralis were studied at Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California. The study lasted from April 22 through May 25,
1991. Three different habitats around the station were chosen as study sites (Figure
1). Area 1 is a protected, low relief, rocky intertidal habitat in front of Bird Rocks,
area 2 is a sandy beach habitat with emergent rocks between Monterey Boat Works
and Fisher Laboratory, and area 3 is a steep, rocky, wave exposed habitat in front of
the Miller Library.
T.funebralis were collected from each study site on about four to five different
days during low tide. These snails were then brought into the lab and counted. The
T.funebralis with limpets and/or Crepidula adunca on their shells were separated
out from those without commensals. The epizoic limpets were then identified to
species. The position of L.asmi on T.funebralis was noted. The length, width, and
height of each L.asmi was measured along with the width and height of their
gastropod hosts. All measurements were made using a caliper with 0.Imm accuracy
A two-tailed t-test was performed on the mean measurements of L.asmi in the three
different habitats. Both the limpets and snails were returned to their natural
habitats once counting, identification, and analysis were complete.
Identification of juvenile limpet species was done after extensive observations
through a dissecting scope and with the aid of several books (Carlton & Roth, 1974;
McLean, 1978; Lindberg, 1986). Various sized limpets were found and collected out
in the field and from these, growth series were created. The juvenile limpets were
then related to their adult species by following through size series.
