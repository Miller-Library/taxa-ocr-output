limpets on 15 snails in each of my four tanks. Therefore the snails in my study
tended to have more limpets on them at any given time, while Lindberg's limpets
spent more time on the rock substrate.
The mean number of days L.asmi spent on any snail tended to be less than a day
(Flgure 16). About 70% of the total snails ridden had limpets on them for less than a
day. The limpets in Lindberg's (1990) study tended to remain on any one snail for
two to three mean number of days. Most of the limpets in my study moved more
frequently than the four that Radford (1959) observed. She saw no movement by the
limpets from their original hosts after one week. The longest time a limpet in my
study stayed on a snail was between 10 and 11 days, but the majority of limpets
followed Test's (1945) observed patterns where he never noted a limpet remaining
on the same T.funebralis for more than 24 hours. The highest transfer rates were
seen in the HTD tanks.
No one really knows why these organisms transfer so often, especially since each
transfer could potentially lead the limpet to death if it is not accomplished
successfully (like the limpets that fell onto the glass of the aquaria which were then
later eaten by hermit crabs). The amount of microscopic algae on a host's shell may
be a very important factor in determining the transfer rate of L.asmi. An interesting
study would be to look at epiphytic algal biomass as a function of occupancy by
L.asmi and to examine how algal biomass relates to transfer frequency; although the
lack of correlation found in this study with commensal size indicates that transfers
probably occur before food limitation.
The mean number of days L.asmi spent on any hermit crab was also usually less
than one day (Figure 17). The transfer rate from the hermit crabs was actually a little
more frequent than that from the snails. The longest time any limpet spent on a
