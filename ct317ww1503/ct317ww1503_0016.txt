may be an adaption to their bigger hosts. It may also be possible that those L.asmi
which survive in this rough habitat are the larger ones because it has generally been
noted that the number of L.asmi is inversely proportional to the wave action
received by an area (Eikenberry & Wickizer, 1964). Eikenberry & Wickizer observed
that the shell length of L.asmi was bigger where wave battering was heavier. There
may be more food available to the limpets in such a habitat so that they tend to grow
faster. There may be fewer predators in this wave exposed area, so that the limpets
have a greater survivorship and therefore more old limpets are found. The
increased length of L.asmi in this habitat gives the limpet a larger pedal area which
may allow for stronger power of attachment. It could be interesting to see if there is
any correlation between pedal area of L.asmi and the limpet's ability to withstand
wave action.
L.asmi has been observed to occur most frequently on the base of T.funebralis in
all three habitats (Figure 13). The base of the snail's shell is probably a good position
for the limpet because this area can offer the most protection from wind and wave
action, dessication, direct sunlight, and predation. L.asmi was found on the base of
T.funebralis most frequently in area 3 which would be expected if that part of the
host's shell offers protection to the small limpet. The next most favored position on
the snail's shell is the body whorl. The base and body whorl tend to be the two areas
of the T.funebralis' shell where L.asmi can make the tightest fit. Yet L.asmi is
certainly not limited to any one area on T.funebralis' shell. Although other
researchers rarely found L.asmi above the body whorl of T.funebralis, the limpet can
be found on the upper whorls of the snail (Test, F., 1945; Radford, 1959). Actually
field observations revealed that L.asmi can be found anywhere from the apex of
T.funebralis to its operculum.
