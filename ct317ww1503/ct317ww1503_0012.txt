more than once in a day. Clearly from Figure 22, after the altercation in time of tide
changes (on the 15th day), the mean number of transfers during the day begins to
rise as the mean during the night begins to fall. Therefore the extra four hours of a
particular tidal level during the day is enough to significantly increase the mean
number of transfers during the day to a point where they are higher than during the
night.
Behavioral Observations in Aquaria: On the few occasions when L.asmi was
observed to transfer shells, the transfer always occured when the limpet and snails
were submerged. The sequence of events usually started with two snails making
contact with their shells. The limpet on one would lift up its shell and touch the
other snail with its tentacles. Then it would slowly move its body over to the other
snail as long as that snail remained relatively stationary. One time a limpet was
seen to begin to transfer shells when its host suddenly started to move away from
the other snail. So the limpet quickly pulled back its body onto its host and clamped
down on this shell. Once a successful transfer has occured, then the limpet will
usually move around its new host for a little while. Transfers are not always
successful. During the course of this study, some limpets were found lying on their
backs on the bottom of the tanks. These limpets remained on the glass for about 24
hours before they were eaten by a hermit crab. A limpet was even found to transfer
onto an empty shell which was in the tank after one of the hermit crabs had died. A
couple times during the study, a L.asmi was found on top of another L.asmi on a
T.funebralis. The limpet moved around on the other limpet and eventually moved
off onto the base of the snail. L.asmi on the rock substrata were noted to move about
15 cm. in 12 hours.
