Abstract
An ecological survey noted nine species of limpets on Tegula funebralis.
The only adult limpet found on this host was Lottia asmi which is the most
abundant of any epizoic gastropod in three different habitats at Pacific Grove,
California. Other juvenile, commensal limpets may temporarily use the
microhabitat of T.funebralis as protection against desiccation until their shell
size is big enough to withstand the stress on rock surfaces. T.funebralis also
offers small limpets some protection against heavy wave action. L.asmi was
observed to be significantly larger in the wave exposed habitat. Possibly fewer
predators of L.asmi allow for a greater survivability in this area or the increased
amount of food on T.funebralis' shell permits faster growth. L.asmi did occur
on Pagurus, although not as frequently as on Tegula. The lack of correlation
found in this study between commensal and host size suggests that transfers
occur before food limitation. Laboratory observations of the movement of
L.asmi revealed that the mean number of days this limpet remains on a snail
or hermit crab is less than one. Transfers between substrates by L.asmi occured
most often during high tide and the number of transfers during the day was
higher than at night.
