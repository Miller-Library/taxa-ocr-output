Acknowledgements
Twould like to thank my advisor, Chuck Baxter, who first gave me an
appreciation of limpets and who always had another good question to ask. I
especially want to thank him for all the help he offered in the identification of
juvenile limpet species and for the many beautiful slides he took for my final
presentation. Thanks to all those at Hopkins Marine Station who lent invaluable
equipment to me, gave good advice, and offered much encouragement. Of course. I
thank the entire spring class 1991 of 175H for an awesome quarter in Pacific Grove. I
also thank my two dear roommates who probably learned more about tiny limpets
than they ever wished to know. Above all I thank God who is my strength and my
redeemer.
