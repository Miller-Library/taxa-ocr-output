The mean number of days L.asmi spent on any one snail tended to be less than a
day (Figure 16). Approximately 70% of the total snails that were ridden had limpets
on them for less than a day. The longest amount of time a L.asmi spent on any one
snail was between 10 and 11 days. The tanks that were set up as HTD had slightly
higher transfer rates than those that were LTD.
The mean number of days L.asmi spent on any one hermit crab, also tended to be
less than one day (Figure 17). The transfer rate from the hermit crabs tended to occur
à little more frequently than from the snails. The longest amount of time a L.asmi
spent on any one crab was only between 4 and 5 days. With the crabs, once again the
HTD setup had slightly higher transfer rates than those that were LTD.
When comparing the mean number of transfers occuring in the tanks of different
tidal levels during the day (Figures 18-19), the mean for HTD was 8.2 and 5.1 for LTD.
The difference between the means was shown to be statistically significant by a
2-tailed t-test (P«0.001). More transfers are occuring during the high tide level in the
day.
At night the mean number of transfers occuring in the tanks of various intertidal
heights (Figures 20-21), is 6.5 for LTD and 4.6 for HTD. Again the difference between
the means is significant (P«0.001). Hence more transfers are also occuring during the
high tide level in the night.
Finally the mean number of transfers between T.funebralis by L.asmi during the
day was compared to those during the night (Figure 22). The mean number of
transfers during the day was 6.7 and the mean during the night was 5.6. These
means differ significantly (P,0.05). The average transfer rate was about 12.3 transfers
per day with approximately 123% of the population of limpets transferring between
substrates daily. The percentage is larger than 100% because a limpet may transfer
