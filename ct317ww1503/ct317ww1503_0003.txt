L.asmi is known to transfer from host to host, yet the timing and frequency of this
movement is disputed in the literature (Test, F., 1945; Radford, 1959; Eikenberry &
Wickizer, 1964; Lindberg, 1990). There are no studies relating the tidal cycle to L.asmi
movement. Studies of other species of intertidal limpets have shown them to be
mostly active under the turbulence of tidal wash (Rogers, 1968; Wells, 1980).
A fixed period diurnal tide was simulated in aquaria to examine the effect of tidal
exposure on L.asmi movement. The size of T.funebralis and the total number of
days it carried limpets was investigated for any correlation. The transfer rate was
studied in a mixed population of snails and hermit crabs. The number of transfers
made during the day was compared to the number of transfers made at night.
