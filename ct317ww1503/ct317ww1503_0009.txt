shells, while the larger adults were often found on the rock substrate around the
T.funebralis.
The mean Lasmi measurements showed that the length of L.asmi in area 2 was
about 30% smaller than the length of those in areas 1 and 3 (P«0.001; Figure 12). The
length of L.asmi in area 3 was even a little longer than those in area 1 (P«0.05). The
height of L.asmi was about 40% smaller in area 2 than those in areas 1 and 3
(P20.001). The mean height of L.asmi in area 3 is slightly larger than those in area 1
(P«O.1).
L.asmi occurs most frequently on the base of T.funebralis in all three habitats
(Figure 13). The next most frequent position this limpet occupies on the snail shell
is the body whorl. L.asmi can be found further up the Tfunebralis shell (closer to
the apex), but these positions on the host's shell are rather infrequent when
compared to the number of times the limpet is found on the base and the body
whorl. The base of the snail tends to be the most common position of L.asmi on
T.funebralis, especially in area 3. The percent L.asmi on the body whorl of
Tfunebralis is greatest for area 2. Casual field observations have resulted in seeing
L.asmi anywhere from on the apex of T.funebralis to on its operculum. A L.asmi
has even been found on top of another L.asmi which was attached to a T.funebralis.
A linear regression of the length of L.asmi shell against the surface area of its
host's shell (n = 45) showed no correlation between these two variables (r2 = 0.047
Figure 14).
After collecting snails (n =213) and hermit crabs (n = 252) from the tide pools in
the rocky intertidal area, it was found that 11.3% of the T.funebralis had limpets
and/ or C.adunca on their shells, while 7.1% of the Pagurus had limpets and/or
Cadunca on their T.funebralis shells. 7.5% of the snails had L.asmi aboard and 2.0%
