Brooding in Epiactis

force fed using a Pasteur pipette, or were placed on portions of
the oral disc and tentacles. Lenhoff (1965) notes that objects must
contact tentacles in order to mechanically stimulate the feeding
response, but gelatin on the oral disc alone often initiated feed-
ing and tentacles subsequently became involved.
Ciliary currents were never evident on the oral disc, tentacles,
or body wall. Rather the adult contracted the radial muscles in
the portion of its oral disc closest to the food, drawing only that
section of the body toward the everted pharynx. Here vigorous
ciliary action on the expanded lips drew particles into the body:
reversed ciliary action in the pharynx also regurgitated rejected
food. Only if relatively large amounts of desirable food covered
an animal, did it completely contract.
Brooding young often captured particles tumbling from parental
grasp. Dunn (1972) also observed young ingesting bits of food
".. hanging down over the oral disc." This appears to me to be
scavenging behavior on the part of the offspring, not "deliberate"
feeding of young by adults.
The Possibility of Food Transfer Through Tentacles.
Hand (1955) noted that in Epiactis, each tentacle tip was
perforated by a small pore, controlled by a sphincter. A touch
on the tentacle tip caused the pore to close and when an animal was
stimulated to contract, a stream of water was ejected from the hole.
My own observations indicate that in body contractions, most excess
water was forced out through the pharynx, and only if that passage
was blocked, was fluid ejected through the tentacles. But the
