Brooding in Epiactis
All Epiactis used were collected from Pt. Pinos at the south-
ern tip of Montery Bay, and Stillwater Cove, Carmel, California,
within an intertidal range of 12 to -2 feet. Animals were maintained
at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in aquaria,
fingerbowls or plastic tubs supplied with constantly running sea
water at 12-130 C.
SPAWNING
During the morning of May 21, three Epiactis out of four which
were brooding young in a fingerbowl, were observed spawning. Two
of these were in an unusual, contorted shape. Only one wedge of
the oral disc and body wall comprising about one-fifth of the diaÂ¬
meter of the animal was contracted, creating a valley extending in
towards the pharynx and down one side. The body wall below the
limbus (as described by Dunn 1972) i.e. the upper pedal disc, was
extremely puffed, exaggerating the indentation of the brood groove.
One adult appeared more active and this animal, basal diameter j5mm.
limbus diameter iimm, from Pt. Pinos, was observed intently for 1i
hours.
