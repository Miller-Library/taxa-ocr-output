Brooding in Epiactis

capability of Epiactis to pass material through the tentacle tips,
combined with the posture of animals previously noted, (see Protection)
suggested to Dr. D.P. Abbott( pers. comm.) the possibility that
adults may be ejecting particles on, or "nursing", their young.
In an effort to determine if food particles were transfered by this
mechanism, dyed gelatin and other food material coated with graphite,
methylene blue or carmine red particles, was force fed to adults
with a Pasteur pipette. Some adults were also permitted to feed
themselves once food was placed on the oral disc.
Particles Were often seen circulating within the coelenteron
inside the tentacles, but no actual elimination of particles or food
transfer to the young was observed. If adults were eliminating
particles from the tentacle tips, these were too small to be visible
under the dissecting microscope.
The Possibility of Translocation of Food Through the Body Wall
Dunn (1972) investigated the possibility suggested by Verrill
(1869) that attached offspring receive dissolved material trans-
located through the parental tissue. Her studies, using brooding
adults fed on radioactively labelled rat liver, gave inconclusive
results.
A modified version of Dunn's experiment was conducted. Five
brooding adults, each carrying several young, were placed in sepa-
rate dishes. To each dish were added several offspring carefully
removed from other adults. These young were induced to settle in
near proximity to the brooding adult. The adults were then fed
particles of hard boiled egg yolk suspended in seawater and combined
