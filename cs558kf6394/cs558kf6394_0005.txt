Brooding in Epiactis

of the limbus, which is consistent with Dunn's observations (1972).
This was not always the case although, as many adults maintain a
smooth limbus rather than forming the conspicuous indentation in
the limbus region termed a " brood groove" by Dunn (1972). The
"brood pits" referred to by Ricketts and Calvin (1968), were not
found by Dunn (1975). However, in some brooding adults from Pacific
Grove, portions of the body wall overlying the edge of the foot were
expanded, leaving pockets or deppressions in the region of the limbus
where young are attached. Adults appeared to be able to control the
degree of indentation by contracting, and by varying the puffines
the pedal disc.
Dunn (1972) found that ".... adult Epiactis retract their ten
tacles when touched by an Aeolidia, but then partly expand again so
that any young being brooded are exposed." She noted that several
young were detached from the limbus in one encounter with this nudi-
branch. But protection of the young by a screen of parental tentacles,
need not be 100% effective to confer advantage. Dunn (1972) sug
gests that the size of the adult relative to the young affords pro-
tection. An Aeolidia may be sated after consuming a portion of the
adult basal disc, and leave most of the offspring unharmed.
ATTACHMENT
From the standpoint of attachment, brooding of the young could
be advantageous in two ways. First, space for attachment to the
substratum is a limited resource in the intertidal and shallow subtidal
zones on rocky shores. External brooding of young on the parent
body wall at least assures an area for attachment of offspring
