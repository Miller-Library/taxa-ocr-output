Brooding in Epiactis
page 12
Ability to attach effectively, may be a factor determining the
size at which Epiactis can survive independently of the parent.
5. Three possible mechanisms of food transfer between parent and
young were investigated: a. adult ciliary action transports food
to young; b. adults "nurse" young by passing particles from the
coelenteron through the holes in the tips of the tentacles; c. adults
translocate food to the offspring through the parental body wall.
Results indicate that probably none of these representsaaniimportant
food source for the young.
6. My observations and those of Dunn (1972) suggest that the young
capable of feeding themselves on smalllactive food by the time the
yolk supply is exhausted.
7. Some eggs spawned by brooding adults were consumed by attached
young.
