Brooding in Epiactis

methylene blue and tap water.
Artemia nauplii were fed to brooded offspring in an attempt
to determine the smallest size at which young are capable of captur-
ing and eating small living prey. Young only 1.0 mmin basal dia-
meter and bearing 12 tentacles, immobilized and ingested the nauplii
within minutes. Thus it may be unnecessary for the adults to
provide a supplemental food supply to the developing young once the
yolk reserve has been exhausted.
One further source of nourishment should be noted. Dunn (1972)
suggests that spawning occurs during most of the year. It is not
known how often an individual spawns, but the egg ingestion by
attached young, noted earlier, may represent an infrequent but
substantial feeding by the adult to the young. In this way a large
brood, precluding attachment of additional eggs in the limbus
region, may utilize reproductive products which would otherwise be
wasted.
SUFMARY
1. Studies were conducted at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove, California to determine what benefits the externally
brooded young may derive from their parents.
2. In spawning behavior, the body column contracts one one side
to form a valley, extending between pharynx and limbus, which chan-
nels the spawned egg chain to the attachment site. The contraction
passes slowly, in a wave around the circumference of the adult,
depositing a belt of spawned eggs encircling the limbus region.
3. Strength of attachment appears to increase with body size.
