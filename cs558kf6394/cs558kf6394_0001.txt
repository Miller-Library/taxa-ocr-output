Brooding in Epiactis
page 1
Epiactis prolifera is common on the rocky open coast of central
California, attached to rocks, eelgrass and algae (Hand 1955). The
young are brooded externally. The large eggs do not pass through
a planula stage in development. They are extruded from the mouth
of the parent and attach to the ectoderm of the parental column,
where they mature directly into tiny anemones.

The most thorough and inclusive study of the life history and
reproduotive biology of this specie is that of Dunn (1972, 1975).
The present investigation centers on aspects of reproduction and
brooding not fully covered by Dunn, particularly the process of
spawning and egg attachment, and the possible selective advantages
of brooding to the young in terms of better protection,, more secure
attachment, and nutritional benefits which they may receive from
their mothers.
