Brooding in Epiactis
pag
A string of pinkish orange eggs about 400,, in diameter extended
from the slightly everted lips of the pharynx, down the valley of
the contracted body wall. The contraction, under prolonged obser-
vation, passed in a very slow clockwise wave around the circumference
of the adult, taking about an hour to complete a full revolution.
The body wall, at each successive point on the circumference of the
disc, contracted and bent inward forming a valley to receive the
eggs.
Tentacles preceeding the contraction wave retracted and lay
flush against the oral disc so that they were almost completely co-
vered by the infolding upper margin of the column.
The eggs were bound by a mucus string which held them in a
linear series rather than in a bundle. The lower portion of the
egg chain, although obscured by tentacles and re-expanded body wall,
was evidently attached to the column in the limbus region. In the
process of re-expanding after the contraction had passed, the body
wall drew this adherent chain of eggs from the pharynx, which prob-
ably assisted egg ejection by ciliary currents. As the wave of
contraction subsided, the unfolding tentacles and puffed lower body
wall provided protection for the freshly spawned eggs which lay
attached to the body wall in a belt encircling the limbus region.
This behavior continued for an hour and during that time about
sixty eggs were spawned. This corresponds to Dunn's (1972) obser-
vations of fifty eggs spawned in the same amount of time.
Young previously attached to the column wall were observed swal-
lowing eggs which came within reach of their oral discs. Dunn (1972
found freshly spawned ova in the throats of sectioned, sterile
juveniles. After an indeterminant amount of time, the ingested egg
