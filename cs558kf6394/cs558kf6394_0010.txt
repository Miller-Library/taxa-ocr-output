Brooding in Epiactis

with a radioactive algal mix of C14 amino acids. (U.L. mixture
New England Nuclear Corp.) At intervals of 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours,
experimental (attached) and peripheral (control) babies were removed
to assay their radioactivity. Each sample was dehydrated under a
hood, weighted and minced. One ml of NOS (Amersham/Searle)
was added and the vial shaken for at least 12 hours to solubilize
the tissue. 10 ml of Aquasol was then added and after a period of
24 hours, the samples were counted in a Nuclear Chicago Unilux II
Liquid Scintillation unit. Efficiency ranged between 64-72%.
The adults regurgitated some of the material fed to them, re-
sulting in contamination of the surrounding water. Both control
and experimental young became radioactively labelled. A paired
Student t test showed no significant differences in radioactivity
between brooded and non-brooded young in each bowl.
If direct translocation of food occurred, it either represented
an increment too slight to be detectable against backround conta-
mination, or it occurred too slowly to be significant within the
48 hour time frame of this experiment.
Other Methods of Feeding of Young
It appears unlikely that there is any substantial feeding of
attached young by brooding adults via the three mechanisms proposed
above. Dunn (1972) points out that the developing embryo has been
supplied with a large amount of yolk which is still evident in the
endodermalccells of post embryonic juveniles. Present observations,
consistent with those of Dunn, show that offspring 0.6 mm in basal
diameter already bear 6 tentacles containing nematocysts which
fire when the animal is place under a coverslip in a solution of
