Brooding in Epiactis
During the experiment, many animals were observed to have at-
tached initially by the side of the column and/or by the tentacles,
rather than by the pedal disc. Dunn (1972) found no nematocysts
nor mucoprotein gland cells in the column of even a "relatively
large juvenile " (3-4mm); yet these were conspicuous in adults.
They may represent mechanisms by which a larger animal initially
attaches to the substrate,as well as means by which parents securely
attach brooding young.
FEEDING
The intriguing possibility that brooding may provide nutri-
tional benefits for the young through transfer of food from parent
to offspring has not been thoroughly investigated. Three possible
mechanisms were proposed and studied; 1.. transport of particles
to the young by ciliary currents on the parental tentacles and co-
lumn; 2. movement of particles from the parental coelenteron to the
young through the pores in the tips of parental tentacles drooped
over the young; and 3. transfer of soluble materials through the
parental body wall into the attached pedal discs of the offspring.
Direct capture of small organisms from the water by the young was
also investigated.
Ciliary Feeding in Adults and the Possibility of External Transport
of Food
Observations were made on over 50 adult animals feeding on a
variety of substances ; mussel, limpet, squid, bouillon, gelatin,
and Artemia nauplii. Pieces of material 1-3 mm in diameter were
