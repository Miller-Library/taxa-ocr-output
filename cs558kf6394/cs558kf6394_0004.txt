Brooding in Epiactis

become a mass of material within the young, rather than retaining
their spherical form, indicating that the offspring are probably
digesting the yolk. Juveniles as small as 0.7mm were found stuffed
with pinkish-orange egg matter.
The third animal spawning in the same fingerbowl simply extruded
its eggs, with only slight bulging of the pharyngeal lips, onto its
oral disc where they remained for over an hour until they were taken
for microscopic examination. The animal remained fully expanded,
did not form a valley and attached none of the eggs spawned.
Dunn (1972) also observed epidemic spawning in the field and
in the lab on at least four occasions. She describes a constricting
of the throat and lips which extruded the eggs onto the oral disc,
from where they "... eventually drifted over the edge of the disc...
Spawning behavior is ap
and some of them adhered to the column,
parently variable.
PROTECTION
Open Epiactis extend some tentacles laterally, parallel to the
disc; others extend diagonally upward away from the base, but many
tentacles also curve down toward the base, creating a curtain sur-
rounding the brooded young. Adults maintained this 'umbrella" under
gentle proding, but contracted if repeatedly poked with needles or
disturbed by hermit crabs (Pagurus) placed in the same bowl. Appro-
ximately 75% of the time adults re-expanded within 5 to 10 seconds
after contraction. Larger attached offspring, greater than 2.5 mm
in basal diameter, were usually exposed when the parent contracted:
however the smaller young were often entirely enveloped in the folds
