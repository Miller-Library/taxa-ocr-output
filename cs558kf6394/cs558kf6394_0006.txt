Brooding in Epiactis
Second, brooding could involve a strong attachment bond between
parent and offspring during a period when the young are too small
to attach themselves to other substrata. Numerous mucoprotein gland
cells and large nematocysts noted by Dunn (1972) in the limbus re-
gion of the parent body wall suggest the latter possibility. Although
artificially detached young as small as 0.9 mm in basal diameter
attach quite easily to glass plates and rocks in aquaria, Dunn (1972
never observed solitary individuals in the field less than 4 mm in
basal diameter.
To investigate attachment ability vs. size, 25 Epiactis rang
ing from 1.5-18.0 mm in basal diameter were tested individually in
a glass drum 5" in diameter , 6" in length, and 70% filled with
1300 seawater. An animal was placed in the drum and the apparatus
was rotated about its longitudinal axis at the rate of 1 revolution
per 80 seconds for 2 minutes, stopped for 1 minute, and revolved
again for 2 minutes. The animal was considered attached when it
began to rotate with the drum. Only 2 animals out of 25 tested (8%)
were unable to attach for at least 5 seconds. There was no relation-
ship between size and time required to attach. A second criteron,
maintaining adhesion for one complete revolution through the air-
water interface, was used to assess the strength of attachment.
The percentage capable of maintaining attachment for one revolution
increases with each size class. See table below.
