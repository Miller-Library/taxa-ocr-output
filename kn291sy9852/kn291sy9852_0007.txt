current coming from the right, while in Trial II it would
be located on the lower right hand side with current coming
from the left.
There appeared to be no correlation between the flare
angle and current velocity (Table 2). A t-test for two
independent samples showed only one subcolony to have
changed their flare angles significantly from Trial I to
Trial II (Table 3).


Discussion:

Studies conducted in the field and in the laboratory
show that in some instances colonies of Phragmatopoma
californica will change the direction of their flares. A
significant change among field cases took place when sub-
colonies initially facing the ocean were turned to face
land and vice versa. In all of these examples flares were
directed farther away from a 90 degree angle when colonies
were facing the sea. It may be that the incoming wave
action exerted a maximum, detrimental effect on the worms
when flares were at this angle. Bendimg the flares to the
