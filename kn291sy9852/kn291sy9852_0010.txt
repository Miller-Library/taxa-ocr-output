Summary:
1. Colonies of Phragmatopoma californica rebuilt their
flares in the same direction if unmoved.
2. Colonies of P. californica were observed to
occasionally change the orientation of their flares in the
field.
3. It appeared that currents may dictate flare con-
struction, strong currents causing flares to oppose them
and weak currents causing flares to face them.
4. A speculated use for the flare may be in water
retention, allowing tentacles to be used.
