velocities and cause a change in flare orientation from
facing a current to opposing the current.
The two colonies in the pool which built no flares
during the first trial may not have done so because the
water movement was too forceful to allow them to extend
their tentacles and catch the sand particles necessary for
flare construction. It may also have been that the sand was
not suspended for a long enough time in front of the worms
to allow it to be seized.
Additional field observations bring to attention the
possible function of the flare in retaining water. P.
californica was seen only to extend its tentacles when in an
aqueous environment. When colonies which had half of their
flares shaved off were observed while the tide was coming
in, it was noted that the worms with flares, unlike
those lacking them, were able to keep their tentacles ex-
tended for a longer period of time after waves had washed
over them. The reason for this appeared to be that the
flares were able to hold water for short periods of time
after the major run off had occurred.
