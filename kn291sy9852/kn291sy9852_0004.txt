Experimental and Results:
Some Environmental Effects on Flare Construction
A large colony, about 1 m by 1.5 m, was located for
experimentation. The colony appeared as an orderly array
of individual tubes,
extending almost vertically from the
upper surface of a rock. Flares were generally oriented
facing southwest (Figure 1A).
Portions of the colony were separated and their flares
scraped off. These segments of no less than 15 worms were
placed in a triangular, wire cage having its bottom at the
-0.1 foot tide level (Fig. 10). They were positioned so that
the side that had been nearest land was now adjacent to a
cage wall and with the same flare orientation (Fig. 1A).
The subcolonies were kept in place by being wrapped in a
wire screen which was fastened to the cage.
Worms were left in the cage for 24 to 48 hours, time
enough for the building of new flares. Following this time
