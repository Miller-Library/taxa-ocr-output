also try to determine the role that predominating currents
might play in flare formation.
Materials and Methods:
Experiments were carried out on colonies of Phragmatopoma
californica obtained from the rocky intertidal between
Point Cabrillo and Point Allones, Pacific Grove, California.
Field studies were conducted in the area from which
colonies were collected. This area runs southwest to
northeast into the ocean, and has P. californica colonies
extending approximately from the +3.3 foot to the -3.0 foot
tide level. It is surrounded by sand on either side. The
area is semiexposed and subject to a fair amount of wave
action. The P. californica colonies are mainly located on
rocks.
Laboratory experiments took place at Hopkins Marine
Station. They consisted of simulated field situations with
directed current in both indoor aquaria and an outdoor
pool equipped with a submersible pump.
When flare removal was required this was done simply
