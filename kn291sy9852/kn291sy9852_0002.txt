flares that occupy approximately 180 degrees of the tube
diameter. For a number of reasons, flares also commonly
deviate from 180 degrees. The flares usually project
farthest in the middle and taper towards the sides.
Initial inspection of many colonies makes it appear that
organization of the flare is random. Further investigation
of flares within colonies reveals them to be oriented often
in the same direction. Preliminary field observation and
experimentation demonstrated that when the flares were
scraped off they were usually rebuilt within twelve hours
and in the same direction as previous ones. Worms could
rebuild their flares in one or more differing directions
placed in new locations. Other early
when colonies were
field observations seemed to show that colonies tended to
orient away from strong flows of current. However, colonies
maintained in aquaria after their flares had been removed
were seen to rebuild towards a relatively weak current.
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that certain
environmental factors influence the construction and
direction of flares by Phragmatopoma californica. It will
