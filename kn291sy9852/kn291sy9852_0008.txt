left or right may have lessened the force of waves and thus
provided some protection for the worms.
Subcolonies not changing flare direction were those
that were moved from facing land to facing the side of the
cage, or were in the circulating pool. These results may
indicate that colonies of P. californica tend not to change
the position of their flares and will only do so when
absolutely necessary. The worms maintaining their origin-
al flare orientation may not have had an environmental shift
stressful enough to require any change.
Preliminary observations indicated that worms placed
in a fast current may try to protect themselves by using
their flares as a shield, while those in a slower current
which direct their flare towards the flow may be doing so
to increase their chances of catching food particles. Lab-
oratory attempts to correlate the strength of current with
the direction of the flare proved inconclusive. It may have
been that the range of currents tested was not sufficient
to warrant change of flare position. It would be interest-
ing to see if one placed a colony in two extreme current
