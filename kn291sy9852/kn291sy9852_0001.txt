Phragmatopoma californica is a suspension feeding
polychaete of the family Sabellariidae. It is a common
species in California, forming massive reefs (Smith and
Carlton, 1975). Members of this family live in tubes that
they construct from sand and shell fragments. The anterior
end of these tubes increases in diameter to give a flared
terminus. Clusters of these flares result in the colonies
having a beehive appearance. Thus, these worms are often
referred to as the honeycomb worms.
Except for studies by Roy (1974) which dealt primarily
with activities of P. californica within its tube, the
observations of this paper are new with respect to forma-
tion of the flared terminus of the tubes by this species.
Kirtiey (1968) described the building of massive reefs
on the Florida coast by Phragmatopoma lapidosa. Wilson
(1968, 1969) described the larval settlement behavior
and resulting colonial stucture in the honeycomb worm,
Sabellaria alveolata. Vovelle (1965) investigated forma-
tion of tubes and the nature of colonies in S. alveolata
