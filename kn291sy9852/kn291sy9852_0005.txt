interval the subcolonies were then removed and the new
flare angle was measured with a protractor (Fig.riB).

The entire procedure was then repeated, replacing the worms
in a new cage location.
A t-test for two independent samples revealed P.
californica to have changed flare direction to a.07
level of significance in three out of four field tests. All
cases of significant change took place when a colony was
moved from the front of the cage, facing the sea, to the
back, facing land, or vice versa.

A regularly organized colony of Phragmatopoma californ-
ica was obtained from the intertidal and brought into the
laboratory. The colony was divided into six segments of
no less than ten worms each. These pieces were placed at
no more than 33 cm. interval with wooden blocks positioned
between them. Any open spaces were filled with modeling
clay so as to create a smooth, solid surface on which the
colonies were facing. The pieces were positioned so that
they all pointed in the same direction (Fig. 24). The
