generalized descriptions of the arthropod cuticle have been given
(Richards, 1951; Dennel, 1961; Lockwood, 1967). A visual examination
of the cuticles of several species may reveal characteristics which
could account for any differences or similarities in the rates
of water loss among these animals The presence of a water proofing
layer could be tested histochemically.
The purpose of this study was to re-examine some of the
water-retaining properties of several species of isopods. To determine
whether or not any such properties are inherent to isopods, suggesting
they might be considered as a form of pre-adaptation for their
invasion of land, species representing quite different habitats
were compared. Armadillidium vulgare Latreille (1804) is a terrestrial
species capable of withstanding dry conditions, and is typically
found where a Mediterranean climate prevails. Porcellio scaber Latreille
(180h) is found in more humid terrestrial environments (Miller, 1938).
Idotea (Pentidotea) montereyensis Maloney (1933) is found on algae
primarily in the intertidal regions, where it may face partially
exposed conditions (Menzies, 1950), and Idotea (Pentidotea) resecata
Stimpson (1857) occurs on Macrocystis and was studied to represent
one of the truly marine species of isopods (North, 1971).
The investigation was conducted in two parts. The rates of
evaporative water loss were examined with each species for a series
of temperatures to get an idea of their relative water retaining
properties. An examination of the structure of the cuticle of each
species was undertaken simultaneously to determine the basic
characteristic of their cuticles and to note any significant differences
between the species. Suspecting that waxy substance, or lipids,
