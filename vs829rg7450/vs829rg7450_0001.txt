ABSTRACT
The cuticles of four species of isopods, the terrestrial species
rmadillidium vulgare and Porcellio scaber, and the marine species Idotea
montereyensis and Idotea resecata, were examined, focusing attention on whether
or not there is a detectable lipid layer such as occurs in insects which
might aid in water-proofing the integument of these animals. The rates of water
loss over a range of temperatures were compared. A comparison of such rates with
those of animals which had been treated with chloroform, a lipid solvent, is
presented, and the results suggest that similar methods used in the past may
lead to erroneous conclusions. No lipids were detectable in the cuticles with
histochemical techniques. Basic structural similarities and differences in
the cuticles of the four species are given, and the significance of these
results are discussed.
