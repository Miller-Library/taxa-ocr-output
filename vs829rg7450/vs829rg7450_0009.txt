Histochemistry: The arthropod cuticle can be seen to have three main
subdivisions. The thin, outer epicuticle is generally quite distinct
from the inner exocuticle and endocuticle, which become very difficult
to correctly distinguish in A. vulgare and P. scaber.
Measurements of the thicknesses of each of these layers were made
for each species, using a compound microscope with a bright field
objective and a calibrated micrometer. The results are given in
Table 1, along with a few values reported for the cuticle thickness
of various insects.
Cross sections of each species are shown simplified in Figs. 8.
and 9. In all four species, the epicuticle is seen to be a very thin,
almost transparent and non chitinous layer. It shows no birefringence
when viewed with polarized light. There is no color reaction of the
epicuticle itself with any of the applied stains. The surface texture
of the species differed. That of P. scaber is notably irregular,
particularily at the posterior region of the thoracic segments, as
is shown in Fig. 10. The surfaces of A. vulgare and P. scaber are
frequently covered with fine setae, which are not birefringent and which
are most easily visible when cross sections are viewed under a
phase contrast microscope. The surface structures of I. montereyensis
and 1. resecata show irregularities as well, particularily on the
epimeral plates. The epicuticle appears to have been laid down in
sheet-like subunits, which are diagrammed in Fig. 11 as they are
seen for a few species viewed under polarized light. Such structures
remain after the treatment of the cuticles with chloroform.
