birefringent. I could not determine their structure or function.
The changes in the cuticle after chloroform treatment are most
noticeable in cross sections of A. vulgare. The basic, multi-layered
structure remains, but the pore canals and lamellae are more visible,
and it appears as if the canals may be wider. Of particular note is
the amber or dark colored material which can be seen to fill the canals
in the endocuticle to a line which is uniformly horizontal with the
surface of the cuticle, as is shown in Fig. 12. Such a phenomenon
is never visible in the normal, untreated cuticle, and it seems as
if the material beneath the integument is being drawn up through
the cuticle via the pore canals. Staining with Sudan III and IV
shows no lipids in the cuticle, either before or after treatment
with chloroform. There is considerable staining in areas just beneath
the cuticle, even after chloroform treatment, indicating that
lipids are present there and are not completely removed by the chloroform.
DISCUSSION
Whether or not there is a specific critical temperature at
which the water proofing breaks down in isopod cuticles, such as
those temperatures suggested by Bursell (1955) and others is still
disputable (Edney, 1964, 1968; Lindqvist, 1972; Beament, 1958)
and certainly the presence or suggestion of such points is not
adequate criteria for the presence of a waxy layer which controls
the permeability of the cuticles (Edney, 1957), although investigators
