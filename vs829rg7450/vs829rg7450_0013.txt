resulting from removal of lipid waterproofing and the subsequent
greater permeability of the integument may in fact only reflect the
loss of chloroform by these animals. To test this, dessicator chambers
saturated with chloroform vapors were used, and the results indicated
that it is indeed difficult to distinguish in such experiments the
difference between water loss and the loss of the heavier compound,
chloroform. Because of this, and the possibility that chloroform
may have a variety of other effects on the structure of the
whole animal, data which has been reported relative to chloroform
treatment and increased transpiration rates seems questionable.
Such greatly increased transpiration rates following solvent treat-
ment may not be more than an artifact of the methods used.
Cross sections of the cuticles reveal distinct differences
among the four species examined, although there seem to be a few
categorical differences between the marine and terrestrial forms.
That A. vulgare has the thickest cuticle and is also the most terrestrial
of the isopods studied seems significant. The irregularities in the
surface texture and subunits could be an adaptation for the retention
of water. No lipids were detected within the cuticle of any of the
four species examined, although it is certain that there is a fatty
layer beneath the tuticle in A. vulgare, P. scaber, and I. montereyensis.
Perhaps water proofing is provided by only a small amount of lipid,
such as would form a monolayer or be combined with other structural
components of the cuticle, so as to not be detectable by simple
histochemical methods. Perhaps the water-retaining properties of
the cuticle are not at all dependent on the presence of any lipid.
This study has shown several things with regard to the structure
and function of the isopod cuticle. There is no pre-adaptation
