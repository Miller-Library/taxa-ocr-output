The exocuticle and endocuticle are oftern characterized by
lamellae which run horizontal to the surface of the cuticle. Such
lamellae were visible in all four species, but their thicknesses.
uniformity, and numbers could not be ascertained. Pore and gland
canals could be seen as well, though more easily in the terrestrial
species. Using a phase contrast microscope, the gland canals could
been seen to extend vertically through the entire cuticle, although
they often seemed to be curly rather than extending straight. No
branching of canals was seen in any of the species. With A. vulgare,
small deposits of material were especially visible at the surface
endings of the canals; such endings stained darkly with methylene
blue and osmium tetroxide both before and after treatment of the
animals with chloroform. Such surface deposits are not uniform
throughout the cuticles, but rather are distributed in patches above
regions of darkened material, presumably tanned protein substances.
Theexocuticle and endocuticle of A. vulgare and P. scaber are
almost transparent, can be seen best with a phase contrast microÂ¬
scope, and show birefringence under polarized light. The endocuticle
of A, vulgare stained with methylene blue, which Schatz (1952) describes
to be a reaction characteristic of several insect cuticles. Red
pigmentation in the exocuticle, and sometimes a green coloration in
the endocuticle, make the layers more distinguishable in the two
marine species. Such pigmentation could not be effectively removed
priof to staining by up to four days exposure to short ultraviolet
light. There are also frequently packed, crystal-like amber structures
in the region between the red exocuticle and the endocuticle in both
of the aquatic species, as are shown in Fig. 9. Such structures
fail to stain with any of the lipid stains and seem to be
