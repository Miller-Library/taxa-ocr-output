66.5 mg; and I. resecata, 79.h mg. The animals were first weighed
individually on a Mettler balance and then placed in cylindrical
containers sealed with mesh at both ends. The containers were set
inside a dessicating chamber such that none were stacked on top of
each other. The low humidity of the chambers was achieved by using
Drierite (anhydrous calcium sulfate) and was checked during the experiÂ¬
ment with cobalt chloride indicator papers (Solomon, 1915) to be
less than 10%. The temperature of the dessicating chambers was maintained
by placing them in a regulated temperature cabinet and the temperature
was recorded during each experimental run. The temperatures generally
used were 53 253 293 38, and 50 C. The animals were re-weighed
at the end of an hour's exposure to such conditions, and the weight
loss was recorded.
The surface area of the experimental animals was calculated
for each species by tracing the outline of the outspread animals onto
graph paper using a dissecting microscope with a camera lucida
attachment (Wigglesworth, 1945). The following average figures were
used for each of the given species: A. vulgare, 1.5 cm ; P. scaber
1.38 cm ; I. montereyensis, 1.1 cm; and I. resecata, 1.83 cm".
The rates of water loss were calibrated and expressed as mg/cm/ hr.
To reduce the amount of extraneous surface water initially
clinging to them,,the aquatic animals, both live and dead, were blotted
with paper towel ing and dried slightly with an air stream in a uniform
manner, before the initial weighing. This method was checked for its
accuracy and uniformity by re-wetting and weighing the same animal
several times. For experiments on dead animals, the isopods were
killed by exposure to ammonia vapors for roughly fifteen minutes,
and then used immediately to determine the rates of water loss
