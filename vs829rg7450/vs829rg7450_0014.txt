apparent in aquatic species when compared to the terrestrial isopods.
It has not been possible to detect lipids in the cuticle using
histochemical methods. Most importantly, the methods used, adopted
from those cited in past insect and isopod literature, cannot separate
a variety of possible explanations for the results which are obtained
from such experiments. The structural effects of chloroform in
of these animals are uncontrollable, as are the increases in the rates of
measured "water loss", as such values are erroneously obtained
and reflect a weight loss due to both water and solvent evaporation.
