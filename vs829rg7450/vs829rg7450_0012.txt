in the past have frequently maintained such conclusions. The increased
rates of water loss in the terrestrial isopods A. vulgare and
P. scaber between the 30 - 50 C temperature range could reflect the
breakdown or activation of some other structural component of the
cuticle, thereby increasing the permeability of the integument. Most
of the evidence points toward such a process as being passive.
although recent experiments by Lindqvist (1972) using different
approaches suggest that temperature effects on other body parts.
such as the ailmentary canal and discharges by it, are perhaps
more accountable for changes in the rates of water loss than are
changes in the permeability of the integument.
Lipids suspected to be active in the water proofing of the
cuticle can be extracted with solvents such as chloroform and ether
(Bursell, 1955; Richards and Korda, 1948). The rates of water loss
after such treatment is usually found to be greater than the rates
of untreated animals, as shown in this study using A. vulgare (Fig 7).
Increases in the transpiration rate after a similar treatment have
been reported by experimenters working with insects as well as isopods
(Beament, 1945, 1955; Wigglesworth, 1945; Holdgate, 1956; Klinge,
1936; Umbach, 1934), but usually the increase in transpiration
is shown for only one temperature point. When one graphs the rate
of water loss versus temperature for a wide range of temperatures, the
results show higher transpiration rates by the chloroform treated
isopods, but the shape of the graph is almost identical with that
which depicts the rates of untreated live and dead animals.
The greater weight losses by chloroform treated animals which have
been reported and interpreted to be due to increased water loss
