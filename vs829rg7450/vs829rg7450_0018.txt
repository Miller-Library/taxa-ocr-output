Figure 1. Rates of evaporative water loss for Armadillidium vulgare, live
versus dead animals. The rates of evaporative water loss are plotted
against temperature. The temperatures used for the live animals were
50, 38; 28, 21, and 6°C. The temperatures used for the dead animals
were 50, 30, 30, 25, and 5°C. Each point represents the average rate
for a given sample, and the respective standard deviations are shown.
Figure 2. Rates of evaporative water loss for Porcellio scaber, live versus
dead animals. The rates of evaporative water loss are plotted
against temperature. The temperatures used for the live animals were
50; 383 29, 2h, and 6°C. The temperatures used for the dead animals
were 503 38, 293 25; and 6° C. Each point represents the average rate
for a given sample, and the respective standard deviations are shown.
Figure 3. Rates of evaporative water loss for Idotea montereyensis, live versus
dead animals. The rates of evaporative water loss are plotted against
temperature. The temperatures used for the live animals were 38,
293 253 and 6 C. The temperatures used for the dead animals were 50;
383 295 253 and 7°C. Each point represents the average rate for a
given sample, and the respective standard deviations are shown.
Figure l. Rates of evaporative water loss for Idotea resecata, live versus dead
animals. The rates of evaporative water loss are plotted against
temperature. The temperatures used for the live animals were 383
293 21, and 5'C. The temperatures used for the dead animals were
50, 38, 29; 24, and 5°C. Each point represents the average rate for a
given sample, and the respective standard deviations are shown.
