of the same species which had been treated with chloroform. Inter-
specific comparisons of the cuticles were likewise made. Most of the
descriptions and dimensions which are given refer to sections of the
dorsal part of the thoracic segments of the exoskeleton, as those
were the regions easiest to section and carefully examine.
An additional proceedure called for immersing the whole animals
in a 10% Chlorox solution, followed by 5% potassium hydroxide and
a series of alcohol and xylene baths (Becker & Roudabush, 1912).
The hard, calcified components of the exoskeleton were all that
remained after such treatment; these were examined both as whole
mounts and as sections.
RESULT.
Water loss: The rates of water loss from both live and dead animals
of each species are plotted in Figs. 1-h. Note that there seems to be
no significant difference between the live and dead animals of A.vulgare,
P. scaber, and 1. resecata, suggesting that whatever water-retaining
properties these isopods may have are not due to active mechanisms.
Similar results have been reported by other investigators (Bursell, 1955;
Edney, 1951) working with terrestrial species. The one exception,
that of I. montereyensis, in which the live and dead animals have
slightly different rates, shows the reverse of what might be expected
for the live animals. The deviation is probably due to experimental
error and the size of that particular sample.
The rates of water loss for dead animals of all four species are
