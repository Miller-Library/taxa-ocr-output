shown together in Fig. 5. Note that while there seems to be no difference
between the two terrestrial species and between the two aquatic species,
the differences in the rates between these two groups of animals
are great. The results are simplified and compared with the rates
of evaporative water loss from a free-water surface in Fig. 6. The
differences are what one might expect, since the aquatic forms are
seldom faced with the problems of water shortage. Holdgate (1956)
and Shaw (1955) have reported a similar situation with the rates
for species of aquatic insects being higher than those of the
terrestrial forms.
The rates of water loss by A. vulgare which have been treated
with chloroform are shown in Fig 7 together with the rates of live
and dead animals of that species. Two types of dessication chambers
were set up to determine whether weight loss was truly related to
water loss or whether it might also represent the loss of chloroform -
a heavier and more volatile substance than water. The first set was
identical to those used in the previous experiments; the second set
contained an open vial of chloroform which was used to saturate the
chamber with chloroform vapors and insure that most of the weight
loss recorded was actually due to water loss and not to the evaporation
of chloroform. Note that the rates of the chloroform treated animals
are generally higher and follow the same basic curve when compared
to live and dead animals. The results also show that the rates of
water loss which are recorded from animals following treatment with
such a solvent can greatly be effected by the amounts of the solvent
still remaining in the animals, as evidenced by the discrepency
between the rates figured in which the two different sets of dessicating
