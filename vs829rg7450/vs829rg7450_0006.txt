(Bursell, 1950).
In order to compare the effects of a lipid solvent on the cuticle
of isopods and to test for the removal of such lipids, the animals
were refluxed in chloroform for 2 hours (Bursell, 1955; Holdgate.
1956; Mead-Briggs, 1956; Shaw, 1955; Beament, 1955). After filtering
off the chloroform while it was still warm, blotting the animals,
and allowing the chloroform to evaporate until almost no odor could
be detected (Mead-Briggs, 1956), the transpiration experiments were
carried out as noted above.
For comparison the rate of evaporation from a free-water surface
was found by exposing a shallow vial,with known diameter and filled
with water, in the same apparatus (Wigglesworth, 1915).
Histochemistry: Thin hand-cut sections were made of the exoskeleton
of each species. Sectioning was best achieved by first killing the
animal, either by exposure to ammonia vapors or by quickly removing
the head. The peraeopods were carefully removed, and the animal was
frozen with dry ice. The sectioning was done quickly, using razor
blades, under a dissecting microscope. Sections cut without first
freezing were examined as well.
Some of the sections were stained with methylene blue, Sudan III,
and Sudan IV, the latter two stains being specific for lipids. The
methods followed were those given by Pantin (1918) and Pearse (1968).
Whole animals and sections were also stained for the presence of
lipids by placing the material in a dessicator and subjecting them
to the vapors of a dilution of a 2% solution of osmium tetroxide.
Untreated animals, both normal and stained, were compared with those
