might be in part responsible for any permeability shown by the
cuticles, the effects of a lipid solvent on the rates of transpiraÂ¬
tion and on the substructure of the cuticle were examined.
MATERIALS and METHODS
Animals: Specimens of the terrestrial isopods A. vulgare and P. scaber
were collected from Carmel Valley and Pacific Grove, Monterey County,
California. The marine I. montereyensis was obtained from Dillon
Beach, Marin County, California, and from along the Pacific Grove
coastline south of Monterey Bay, while I. resecata was collected from
Monterey Bay in the vicinity of Hopkins Marine Station. Prior to the
experiments, the terrestrial animals were kept in large containers at
a humidity of 90% and fed on leaf litter and carrots. The marine
species were retained in separate tanks with aerated sea water at
ambient temperature, and either Macrocystis or Phyllospadix presented
as food. All were used within a week of being collected.
Water Loss: The rates of water loss over a range of temperatures were
determined for each of the four species. At least ten animals were
used for each data point, except in the experiments on 1. montereyensis
where only eight and five animals were used at each temperature when
determining the rates of dead and live animals. Only intermolt male
animals of approximately the same size were used, with the following
average weights: A. vulgare, 70 mg; P. scaber, 10.1 mg; L. montereyensis,
