I. montereyensis, and I. resecata, dead animals. The rates of evapora-
tive water loss for dead animals of all four species are plotted
against temperature. Each point represents the average rate for a
given sample, and the respective standard deviations are shown.
Figure 6. Patterns of evaporative water loss for typical aquatic and terrestrial
isopod species. The patterns are derived from Figs. 1-5, and
compared to the pattern of water loss at similar temperatures
from a water surface of known area.
Figure 7. Effects of chloroform treatment on the rates of evaporative water loss.
The rates of evaporative water loss are plotted against temperature.
The dashed line represents animals which were treated with chloroform
and dessicated in chambers which were partially saturated with
chloroform vapors initially. The solid line connecting points from
the other chloroform-treated animals represents animals which were
dessicated under normal experimental conditions. The rates of
evaporative water loss from untreated animals, both live and dead,
and plotted also. Each point represents the average rate for
given sample, and the respective standard deviations are shown.

Figures are given in microns. The range given represents the variability
found in ten animals of approximately the same size.
