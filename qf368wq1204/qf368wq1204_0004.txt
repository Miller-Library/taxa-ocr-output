electrodes with resistances between 1 and 6 megohms and filled with 3M KCl. The dish
was placed on a Peltier heating and cooling device that increased and decreased the
temperatures over periods of two to four hours between 10 and 20 or 14 and 25°C to
simulate more or less what the animals might see in the intertidal zone (Somero and
Tomanek 1999). Voltages were recorded continuously throughout each temperature
ramp using Clampex 8.0. In the case of neurons that showed no spontaneous activity, a
depolarizing stimulus (constant throughout an entire trace but not between experiments)
was used.
Results
Pacemaker neurons
Two neurons exhibited spontaneous activity at some time during the temperature
ramp. One was in a bath that was heated from 10° to 20°C over one hour then cooled
from 20° to 10° over the same time interval (Fig. 1). It showed bursting pacemaker
activity at the beginning of the experiment. As it was heated, the frequency of the action
potentials increased, and it changed from firing bursts of action potentials to constant
action potentials. At 20°, it fired a few last, high frequency bursts then ceased to fire.
During the cooling to 10°, it did not regain its firing behavior nor did it start again even
after two hours in a 10° bath after the experiment. Throughout this time, it could be
stimulated to fire action potentials with a depolarizing current.
1 observed a second neuron as it was heated from 14° to 25°C over two hours then
cooled from 25° to 14° over the same time interval (Fig. 2). This cell did not show any
spontaneous or endogenous activity at 14° or for the first hour and a half while it was
