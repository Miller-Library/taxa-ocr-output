Pacemaker neurons
Pacemaker neurons generate patterned electrical activity in the absence of
synaptic input from other cells. Neurons of this type control a wide range of
physiological processes including respiration, peristalsis, locomotion and sensory
perception - all necessary for the animal’s survival. I would expect that some pacemaker
neurons would have a way to compensate for temperature changes to maintain a constant
output in all the temperatures in the animal’s environment. Work by Johnson, Smith and
Thompson suggested differential temperature sensitivities of potassium currents that
regulate the bursting frequency of bursting pacemakers to allow the animals to behave the
same at different temperatures.
In the case of certain pacemaker neurons, this may be the case. In the two I
observed, however, their behavior changed dramatically with the changes in temperature.
Because 1 do not know what processes these two particular neurons control and could not
see what effects they have on the behavior of the animal, I can only guess about the
meaning of such obvious changes in behavior on the part of the two individual neurons.
Fletcher and Ram (1991) presented similarly interesting results working with R15
bursting pacemaker neuron in Aplysia, noting that high temperatures reversibly silenced
the cells and that a return to low temperatures allowed most R15 neurons to resume
bursting activity but with evident changes from pre-heating activity. Moffett and
Wachtel (1976) demonstrated that at really low temperatures, some bursting pacemakers
are not active as well as that whole animal behavior could be elicited only at temperatures
