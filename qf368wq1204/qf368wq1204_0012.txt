A third possibility is that the individual neurons are very temperature sensitive
and change in their own individualistic ways to changes in temperature. My results are
consistent with this hypothesis, and further study is needed to determine the nature of
such a complicated and integrated mechanism of temperature compensation if behavior
does indeed remain the same.
The fourth explanation is that the changes in the nervous system result in changes
in the animalâ€™s behavior. My experiment did not test this hypothesis directly, but my
results are consistent with such a mechanism. I would like to see behavioral studies that
connect the activity of the nervous system with how the animals behave at different
temperatures.
Overall, my results point to an integrated temperature compensation on the circuit
and cell interaction level that is more complicated and integrative than temperature
compensation in each neuron or a simple change in baseline as all the neurons change
uniformly with temperature. Complex integration of the nervous system would allow
these animals to maintain complex behaviors over the temperature range of their habitat
and change their behavior adaptively.
