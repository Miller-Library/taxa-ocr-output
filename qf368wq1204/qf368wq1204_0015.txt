Fig. 1. Change in the behavior of one pacemaker neuron during a two hour temperature
ramp from 10° to 20  and back Voltage in millivolts on the y-axes, Time in
milliseconds on the x-axes. One minute traces. Times in parentheses are times after the
start of the temperature ramp.

temperature ramp from 14° to 25 C and back Voltage in millivolts on the y-axes, Time
in milliseconds on the x-axes. One minute traces. Times in parentheses are times after
the start of the temperature ramp.
