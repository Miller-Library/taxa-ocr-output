heated. At 19.5°, it began firing spontaneous action potentials which continued and
increased in frequency as the temperature increased to 25°. During the two hours while
the temperature returned to 14°, the frequency of the action potentials decreased and
started to show a bursting pattern. This behavior continued for the next two hours at 14
instead of returning to the silent state it was in before the ramp.
Neurons with no spontaneous activity-firing frequency
Trecorded from two cells that showed no spontaneous activity at any point during
the two hour temperature ramp from 10° to 20°C and back. To compare the frequency at
which they fired action potentials in response to a stimulus, they were given 5 second
depolarizing stimuli periodically throughout the temperature ramp to elicit trains of
action potentials (Fig. 3). The depolarizing current was constant throughout each
experiment, but was not the same for the two different neurons.
The average firing frequency during the 5 second stimuli of the first neuron
increased with temperature, and then decreased to a lower frequency than it had before
the ramp (Fig. 4).
The firing frequency of the second neuron also increased with temperature.
However, it remained high even after the bath was cooled to 10° again (Fig. 5).
Neurons with no spontaneous activity - utilization time
I also looked at how the utilization time (the interval between the onset of the
depolarizing stimulus and half peak of the first action potential) changed with
temperature in the two neurons I discussed in the section on firing frequency.
