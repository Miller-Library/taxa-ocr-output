neurotransmitter. Alternatively, the high temperatures may have altered the
conformation of the channels or the integrity of the enzymes that remove the
neurotransmitters. Regardless of the mechanism, the temperature apparently caused a
change in these neurons that had long lasting effects and that again showed a complicated
temperature response.
Photo response
Another synaptic phenomenon I observed as it changed with temperature was
photosensitivity. When I turned the light off at 10°C, it caused a depolarization in the
neuron from which 1 was recording but that depolarization did not cause an action
potential. At 20°, the same stimulus (turning off the light) did cause the neuron to fire an
action potential. It appears that the action potential threshold was lowered at the higher
temperature, again due to a change in the balance of inward and outward currents. When
the neuron was 10° warmer, either the depolarization it experienced or its reaction to that
stimulus was different.
Conclusions
The first mechanism 1 proposed for temperature compensation in these animals
was that of individual neurons. All of the nerve cells I studied change with temperature
and disprove this hypothesis.
The second mechanism I proposed was that the individual nerve cells of the
whole nervous system change uniformly with temperature. The hysteresis and obvious
non-uniformity of my results disprove this hypothesis.
