returning to a lower frequency at the end of ramp compared to the beginning (both at
10Â°C). The second neuron demonstrated strong hysteresis by remaining at the high
frequency even after the temperature returned to 10
Not only do these two neurons change with temperature, they change
hysteretically and differently, further disproving hypotheses 1 and 2.
Neurons with no spontaneous activity - utilization time
This interval is largely determined by an outward, inactivating, Shaker-like
potassium current called A current. The balance between it and several inward currents
determines the time it takes for an action potential to occur after the onset of a
depolarizing stimulus (Connor and Stevens 1970 and Smith and Thompson 1987).
Temperature evidently changed this balance in both neurons I observed.
The first cell behaves in a way one might expect - the interval decreases with an
increase in temperature then increases when the temperature returns to lower
temperatures again. I did not test the mechanism in this experiment, but maybe the
potassium current inactivates more quickly at higher temperatures or maybe the
potassium current decreases at higher temperatures. Either way, the kinetics of the action
potential change with temperature.
The other neuron shows a different and in some ways more interesting and
complex response to temperature. In its case, the utilization time decreases during the
increase in temperature as it does in the previous example, but then continues to decrease
even after the temperature decreases again. For this nerve cell, the temperature change
has a large and long-lasting effect on the kinetics of the currents that determine action
