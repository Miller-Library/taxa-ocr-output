Abstract
Ectothermic animals in the intertidal zone perform complex behaviors over a
large range of temperatures. Based on their ability to function at such different
temperatures, their nervous systems must compensate to accommodate for environmental
changes, either in order to keep behavior the same or to change the animalâ€™s behavior in
favor of homeostasis. To look at how a nervous system behaves at different
temperatures, isolated ganglia from the yellow dorid nudibranch, Doriopsilla
albopunctata, were exposed to temperature ranges simulating those of the intertidal zone
(10 to 25 degrees Celsius). Single electrode intracellular recordings were taken to study
the behavior of individual neurons. Variation in spontaneous activity, firing frequency,
utilization time and synaptic potentials revealed individualistic, non-uniform responses to
temperature on the neural level. The data suggest that neurons in Doriopsilla
albopunctata are not individually temperature compensated, and therefore temperature
compensation does not happen on the neuronal level. Nor do the data show that all nerve
cells respond to temperature the same way. Instead these results suggest that the overall
maintenance of neural function across a temperature gradient arises from properties of the
system as a whole rather than individual neurons.
