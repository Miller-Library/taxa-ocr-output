Introduction
It is remarkable that ectothermic animals can live in places such as the intertidal
zone. They cannot regulate their body temperatures to keep functioning properly, yet
they perform complex behaviors in a wide range of temperatures as the weather and the
tides change around them. Presumably, their nervous systems have ways to compensate
for such dramatically changing conditions.
Some work has been done in the past on the effects of temperature on the nervous
system. Knape (1999) presented evidence that the spontaneous action potential
frequencies in sensory nerve bundles in the walking legs of porcelain crabs varies more
with temperature for low intertidal species than high intertidal species, indicating a
nervous system compensation to temperature for the high intertidal species. Johnson.
Smith, and Thompson (1986) suggested that temperature compensation in bursting
pacemaker cells in molluscs may be accomplished by a temperature - dependent
gradation in the relative contribution of different ionic currents. Anderson (1976) found
that the rate at which bursts are produced is relatively insensitive to temperature, again
suggesting temperature compensation. The question then is whether their nervous
systems are in fact temperature compensated. And if they are, how?
One hypothesis is that temperature compensation happens within each individual
neuron. If this were true, each neuron would be able to adapt such that its behavior did
not change at all within the temperature range the animals experience. Another
hypothesis is that the neurons do change with temperature, but they do so uniformly. If
this were the case, the whole integrated system could work the same way at every
temperature, just at a different base level. A third hypothesis is that the neurons are
