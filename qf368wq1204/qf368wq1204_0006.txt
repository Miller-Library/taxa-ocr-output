Paralleling the changes in firing frequency, the utilization time of the first neuron
decreased with temperature then increased again while the temperature returned to 10°C
(Fig. 6). The utilization time of the second neuron decreased with increasing temperature
then continued to decrease even while the temperature returned to 10° (Fig. 7).
Synaptic potential
Tlooked at the synaptic input received by one neuron within an intact ganglion
during a two hour temperature ramp from 10° to 20°C and back to 10° (Fig. 8). Looking
at the half time to rise and half time to fall of individual excitatory post-synaptic
potentials at different points along the temperature ramp, little change in the half time to
rise was apparent but half time to fall increased dramatically at the end of the temperature
ramp.
Photo response
In order to record a poly synaptic response in a pleural ganglion neuron, I
recorded its activity in response to turning off the light. The ganglion was left intact so it
could sense changes in light. The photo response of the intact ganglion caused an
excitatory post-synaptic potential in the pleural ganglion neuron at 10°C and an action
potential at 20°C (Fig. 9).
