at which the nervous system showed a sufficiently high general level of activity and
bursting pacemakers were active.
Perhaps the two neurons I observed change their behavior according to
temperature in order to change the behavior of the animal in a way that is adapted to the
environment in which it finds itself. One neuron could send the signal for the animal to
seek shade to get back to a more livable temperature. Or, it could tell the animal that the
tide pool in which it finds itself is too hot so it should not lay eggs there. I could not
directly test these ideas, but they would be consistent with my fourth hypothesis (that the
nervous system changes in response to temperature so that the animalâ€™s behavior changes
in response to temperature) and be an exciting area for further research.
Another possibility is that the behavior of these two neurons changed in order to
play their part to keep the whole integrated nervous system working the same even as
each individual cell changed. Again, I did not test this hypothesis, but it may be possible.
My results did directly refute the first two hypotheses proposed in the
introduction, however. Both pacemaker neurons changed, and they changed in different
ways, disproving the hypothesis that neurons do not change with temperature and that
neurons change uniformly with temperature. The next four examples provide further
evidence against these two hypotheses.
Neurons with no spontaneous activity-firing frequency
The firing frequency of action potentials of both neurons changed during the
temperature ramp when stimulated with constant depolarizing current stimuli. The firing
frequency of the first neuron increased with temperature then over-compensated by
