individualistically temperature sensitive. The nervous system as a whole, individual
circuits or intercellular interactions would compensate for temperature changes by
integrating the information in different ways at different temperatures in order to
maintain constant behavior over the whole range of temperatures. Fourthly, the neurons
and the nervous system as a whole might vary with temperature such that the animal’s
behavior changes in a way that is adaptive to the changing environment and helps it
maintain relative homeostasis.
To begin to test the first two of these hypotheses and obtain preliminary data for
the second two, 1 used Doriopsilla albopunctata as the study organism because it is an
ectothermic, subtidal and intertidal organism that has large, easy to work with neurons.
Materials and Methods
Doriopsilla albopunctata were collected intertidally at the Great Tide Pool in
Pacific Grove, California. They were stored in flowing natural seawater tanks at
approximately 13°C with tunicates and sponges to eat.
Ganglia were surgically removed and treated with dispase, a neutral protease, for
one hour at 4°C followed by a one to 12 hour soak in sea water (again at 4°C) to facilitate
removal of the epineural sheath, which was then removed using forceps. It has been well
documented that mulluscan ganglia show the same types of record activity, including
well-coordinated activities, when isolated as they do inside an intact animal (for example,
Treistman 1985)
The ganglia were left intact and pinned to a dish using cactus spines. Single electrode
intracellular recordings were taken from individual neurons in the pleural ganglia using
