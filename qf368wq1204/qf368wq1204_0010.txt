potentials that causes the utilization time to continue to shorten even after the
temperatures return to those at the beginning of the experiment.
Synaptic potential
The behavior of individual nerve cells in response to temperature changes is
important, but so are neural networks and intercellular interactions if we are to know the
nature of how the whole nervous system responds to temperature. Here, I tried to gain
some insight into how the kinetics of the neurotransmitters that neurons use to
communicate with each other change with temperature.
Recording the half time to rise of excitatory post-synaptic inputs in one cell as it
received information from neighboring cells, it appeared that the half time to rise - or the
time between the onset of the input and half of the maximum depolarization - increased
to a small degree throughout the temperature ramp. The half time to fall - or the time
between the peak depolarization and half way back to baseline - increased substantially
at the end of the temperature ramp. Again, I did not look into the mechanism, but I can
make guesses and propose areas where fürther research could tell us more about how the
nervous systems of these ectothermic, intertidal animals deal with temperature gradients.
Perhaps when the temperature increased, the pre-synaptic neuron started releasing
more neurotransmitters to compensate for some other temperature-related changes in the
system. Then when the temperature returned to 10°, the kinetics returned to how they
had been before the ramp but the pre-synaptic neuron was still releasing an elevated
amount of neurotransmitter. The small increase in half time to rise and the large increase
in half time to fall then could be due to the neuron’s ability to deal with the extra
