mutation F425G in this channel that acts to increase CTX-binding affinity by three orders
of magnitude makes the channel insensitive to k-PVIIA. Thus, the two toxins, which
have been determined to be structurally similar in protein conformation and folding, do
not appear to share the identical amino acid residue at the position that mates with the
F425 binding site. Since additional amino acid residues on the K channel are also
important for binding of CTX (Miller, 1995), some of these may overlap with those
important for K-PVIIA binding. Other residues are likely to be unique to each toxin.
Thus, both toxin types are potentially very useful in studying and mapping the structure
of the K channel outer vestibule from a diverse group of K channel targets.
KA-Conotoxin SIVA, isolated from C. striatus, is a peptide that has also been
shown to affect K channels, but is structurally different from the k-conotoxin PVIIA
taken from C. purpurascens (Craig et al., 1998). This class of k-conotoxins is an
antagonist of Shaker K channels as well, but the block of Ix in this case is only slowly
reversible. Using a frog nerve-muscle preparation, the peptide produced repetitive action
potentials. Thus, the block of voltage-gated K channels by KA-SIVA may be involved in
this neuroexcitatory activity.
u-Conotoxins
u-Conotoxins are those Conus peptides that target sodium channels and impair
propagation of action potentials. In voltage-clamp experiments, the u-conotoxins
produce a decrease in voltage-gated Naâ€™ current (Iya). u-Conotoxin GIIIA was first toxin
of this class isolated (from C. geographus) and is selective for vertebrate skeletal muscle.
One distinguishing characteristic for u-GIIIA is that it competes with classical Na
