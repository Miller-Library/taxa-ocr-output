works in addition to the effect of inducing an increase in synaptic quantal release in the
neuromuscular junction (Harvey and Anderson, 1985).
Preliminary results studying the effects of C. striatus venom on Na- channels in
frog SG and dorsal root ganglia neurons indicated that a venom dilution of 1:1000
induced a -10 mV shift in channel activation. This shift in Na' channel conductance
could possibly give rise to the spontaneous action potential firing effect seen in the frog
neuromuscular prep, as channels would be shifted closer to their action potential firing
threshold. The Na" shifting effect and K channel block could work in conjunction to
produce the spontaneous firing.
With further isolation and purification of the active component of this C. striatus
venom, a greater understanding of the nature of the Conus attack will emerge. In
addition, pharmacological block of Ix by TEA and dendrotoxins have been used to mar
the pore regions as well as dissect the electrophysiological properties of various K
channel types over the years and have led to a greater understanding of the diversity seen
in this group of ion channels. With time, it is possible that this Conus venom K channel
blocking component could emerge as a means by which this complicated area of research
can further be developed.
