mammalian central nervous system, whereas GIIIB targets the skeletal muscle subtype
with high affinity yet does not affect central sodium channels (Mclntosh et al., 1995).
Two peptides from C. pennaceus, PnIVA and PnIVB, show the same disulfideÂ¬
framework as MrVIA and MrVIB, but have different amino acid compositions. These
also block Iya when applied to Aplysia and Lymnaea neurons (Fainzilber et al., 1995). It
thus appears that these toxins would also fall into the uO-conotoxin family. Each of these
peptides and those yet to be found will also help to bring about subtype-specific ligands
for further research of Na channels.
8-Conotoxins
8-Conotoxins are a category of conopeptides, which also affect voltage-gated Na"
but produce a different response by the targeted channels. These toxins bind to Na
channels and act to disrupt the inactivation process. 8-conotoxin PVIA, isolated from C.
purpurascens, caused hyperactivity in fish followed by spasms, but without death or
paralysis. This toxin has been found to complement the action of other conotoxins in
contributing to the in vivo effect on the fish upon injection by the snail (Terlau et al.,
1996).
