conotoxin SIVA has been described in C. striatus which causes spastic paralysis in fish,
appears to block voltage-gated Shaker K channels, and causes repetitive action
potentials following a single stimulus in the frog neuromuscular preparation (Craig et al.,
1998).
Conus toxins directed against voltage-gated K and Na channels
My research at the present time is limited to the effects of Conus striatus venom
on voltage-gated Na' and voltage-gated K channels. For this reason I have focused my
literature review on those articles pertaining to the three main categories of Conus venom
components that are known to affect either of these two types of channels. These include
the k-conotoxins, which selectively inhibit K channels, and u-conotoxins and ô¬
conotoxins, which selectively affect Na channels.
k-Conotoxins
k-Conotoxins have been classified as those peptides isolated from Conus species,
which produce an effect on voltage-gated K channels. Thus far, only two k-conotoxins
have been identified. The first, k-conotoxin PVIIA, isolated from Conus purpurascens,
has affects on Shaker H4 channels. In voltage-clamp experiments, the toxin produces a
reversible reduction in peak K currents (Ig) with dose dependence, consistent with a 1:1
binding stoichiometry for the toxin and receptor site (Shon et al., 1997).
In the Shaker channel, PVIIA is known to interact directly with the external TEA
binding site in the external vestibule region, and in this regard is analogous to the
charybdotoxin (CTX) family of scorpion toxins (Terlau et al. 1999). However, the
