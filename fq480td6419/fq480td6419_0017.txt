from the same snail within a similar post-captivity timeframe. This venom stock was
thawed, brought to final concentrations, mixed, and added to the reservoir during data
acquisition.
Cells
Neurons were isolated from caudal paravertebral sympathetic ganglia of adult
frogs (Rana pipiens). Immediately following decapitation and pithing, the ganglia were
removed and placed in a Ringer solution of the following composition (mM): 100 NaCl.
2.5 KCl, 4 MgCh, 10 Glucose, 10 HEPES. To this solution Collagenase A (3 mg/ml),
and Protease Type XIV (1-1.5 mg/ml) were added and the cells treated for 45 minutes.
Neurons were then teased onto small glass cover slips that had been treated with
protamine. These cells were then stored in 50:50 2.5 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM
Cach, 5 HEPES, pH 7.2 frog Ringer/L15 culture medium at 4 â€™C for up to one week.
Cells appeared most healthy 2 days following plating.
Electrophysiological Recording
Conventional whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed with the frog
sympathetic ganglia neurons. External frog solution contained 5 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl,
115 TMA-Cl, 1 mM CaCh, 4 mM MgCh, 10 HEPES with a pH of 7.2 (adjusted with
NaOH). Currents were recorded at room temperature using a voltage clamp amplifier and
a low-pass filter set at 15 KHz. Electrode resistance with 7052 glass was 1.0 to 3.5 MQ
when filled with an internal solution containing either (40 mM KF, 35 mM KCl, 40 mM
KAsp, 2 mM EGTA), or (0 mM F, 40 mM K-Glu', 40 mM K-Asp, 35 mM KCl, 1 mM
