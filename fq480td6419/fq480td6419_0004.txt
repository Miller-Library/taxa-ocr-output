Figure 1: Basic venom effect. Externally applied Conus venom causes time-dependent
block of frog sympathetic ganglia voltage-gated Kchannels
Figure 2: Conus venom does not alter the K conductance versus voltage relationship
Figure 3: Venom block of Ix occurs in a voltage-independent manner
Figure 4: Concentration dependence of steady-state Ig block
Figure 5: Time course of lg block at two relative venom concentrations
Figure 6: S-Nitrosodithiothreietol does not modify sympathetic ganglia Ix
Figure 7: Sympathetic ganglia neuron Ig is TEA sensitive
