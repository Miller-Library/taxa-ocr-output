NazEDTA, 1.3 mM CaCh, 1 mM BAPTA, 2 mM Tris-ATP), both at a pH of 7.3. Results
did not appear to be influenced by which solution was used.
All currents were compensated for linear capacitive and ionic currents using a
standard P/4 subtraction protocol. Voltage commands were generated using software and
a direct memory access (DMA) interface developed by D. Matteson, University of
Maryland. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with the same program. Holding
potential was -80 mV throughout all experiments. Recordings were made at room
temperature (20-22Â°C).
Application of venom
The setup for frog sympathetic ganglia recording included an Air Cadet
vacuum/pressure station (Cole-Parmer Instrument) to allow exchange of the external
solution. A volume of 0.5 to 1.5 ml of the experimental solution was perfused into the
chamber with this system while aspirating the overflow. Recording chamber volume was
200 ml.
Results
Outward Ik is blocked by a C. striatus venom component
Control Ig (Fig. 1) was evoked in response to a 25-ms depolarization to +20 mV
and represents maximal activation of K conductance. In the frog sympathetic ganglia
neurons tested, K channel activation was generally at its peak at around 25 ms at each
voltage tested.
