Conotoxins are remarkably specific to the prey type for each Conus species.
Studies carried out by Endean and Rudkin (1965) showed that crude venom samples from
several Conus species that were fish eaters had no effect on mollusks or worms, whereas
toxins from mollusk-eating species did not affect fish. This is consistent with the idea that
particular Conus species selected for a match between prey-type and toxin complement
during their evolutionary history. In some cases, however, toxins from species that
selectively prey on other gastropod mollusks are very potent in mammalian systems, such
as those from Conus geographus, C. magus and C. textile. Specificity of such peptides
occurs not because the cone snails have selected for a conotoxin that is directed against
mammalian systems, but because a particular feature of the channel or receptor target is
highly conserved in both mammals and mollusks (Olivera et al., 1991).
Conus striatus
Conus striatus is a relatively large cone snail found in the Indo-Pacific. It is one
of the most widely distributed cones, and was the first ever described as specializing in
fish hunting (Kohn, 1956).
Peptide batteries in C. striatus and C. magus have been shown to differ from other
Indo-Pacific fish hunters in their composition. All of the Indo-Pacific Conus described
make peptides, which target the block of neuromuscular transmission. C. purpurascens
produces both a noncompetitive nicotinic antagonist (aA-conotoxin) and a competitive
nicotinic antagonist (y-conotoxin). C. ermineus contains a competitive nicotinic agonist
only. The peptides of C. striatus and C. magus, however, are o-conotoxins which target
calcium channels and are not present in the other fish hunters. Additionally, the KAÂ¬
