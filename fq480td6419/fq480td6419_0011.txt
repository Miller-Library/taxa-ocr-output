u-Conotoxin PIIIA appears to target a wider variety of mammalian voltage-gated Na
channel subtypes in the mammalian CNS than does u-GIIIA.
TTX/STX-sensitive Na channels could be divided into three categories based on
the distinguishing features of u-PIIIA and u-GIIIA,: 1) Those channels sensitive to both
u-PIIIA and u-GIIIA, for example the skeletal muscle subtype in both frog and
mammalian systems. 2) Those sensitive to TTX and u-PIIIA but more resistant to uÂ¬
GIIIA, such as rat brain Type II Na channels. 3) Channels resistant to both u-PIIIA and
u-GIIIA, with most of the total CNS Na channels falling into this category (Shon et al.,
1998). The varieties of u-conotoxins presently known and those yet to be discovered will
be useful in determining the roles of Na channel subtypes in neurons and circuits when a
variety of molecular forms of voltage-gated Na' channels are present.
Another, divergent group of Na channel-directed peptides is the O-glycosylated
uO-conotoxins. These Conus peptides, isolated from C. marmoreus and C. pennaceus,
produce a biological effect similar to that of the previously described u-conotoxins, yet
they are structurally distinct and show different disulfide-bond arrangements. Two
peptides from C. marmoreus, MrVIA and MrVIB have been characterized which block
Na channels in Aplysia neurons. Classical sodium channel blockers TTX and STX have
not been found to be efficient in Aplysia and other marine gastropods. The u-conotoxin
GIIIB, when injected intraperitoneally in rodents acts as a powerful paralytic agent, yet if
injected intracranially no detectable symptoms are observed. In contrast, uO-conotoxin
MrVIA is inactive peripherally in rodents, but induces ataxia andor reversible coma
within minutes when injected intracranially. This indicates that MrVIA is potent in the
