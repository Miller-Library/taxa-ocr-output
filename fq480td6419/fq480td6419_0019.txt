C. striatus venom did not act to alter the conductance versus voltage (G-V)
relationship for K currents. Conductance was measured and normalized for both control
and venom sensitive K+ currents in different cells. When conductance of venom-sensitive
K channels was following the subtraction of all Ix unaffected by venom from the control
Ik levels, no detectable difference was seen between the control and +venom curves at
either venom concentration tested (Fig. 2 A,B). Similarly, venom block of Ig occurred in
a voltage-independent manner, as the I-V plot of Icontol versus Lyenon over a series of
voltages gave a similar value for voltage at 50% conductance of around-5 mV (Fig. 3A).
Block induced by venom introduction occurred in a concentration-dependent
manner in which steady-state Ig was blocked by about 80% and 60% by 1:500 (Fig. 4A)
and 1:1000 (Fig. 4B) dilution venom, respectively. The full effect of block of Ig occurs
slowly at both concentrations tested for all neurons. Time to 50% of maximal block was
achieved, on average, approximately twice as fast with the higher concentration 1:500
dilution venom at 150-200 sec. for 1:500 to around 320 sec. For 1:1000 (Fig. 5 A,B).
Frog sympathetic ganglia Ik is insensitive to S-Nitrosodithiothreietol (SNDTT)
It was found in this study that control Ix and Ig in the presence of 10 mM SNDTT
do not show differences in either current amplitude or kinetics (Fig. 5B, 6). SNDTT is a
selective blocker of the Kvl family of K+ channels (Brock, Mathes and Gilly, 1997).
When 1:1000 dilution C. striatus venom was applied to the same cell that did not show a
SNDTT effect, Ix was reduced to a level of 45% of control over 16 minutes. The
convincing lack of effect of SNDTT in a cell that showed reduction of Ix following
