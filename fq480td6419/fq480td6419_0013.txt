Effects of Conus striatus venom on voltage-gated K channels
in frog sympathetic ganglia neurons
Abstract
Cone snails are predatory marine gastropods of the genus Conus which
proliferated to over 500 species world wide largely through the use of novel peptide
toxins (conotoxins) that are injected into prey items through a harpooning apparatus.
Conotoxins have evolved for maximal effect on prey species hunted by each cone snail
species (Duda and Palumbi 1999). All cone snail venoms examined thus far contain
peptides that act with great specificity on a variety of channels including K, Na', Ca,
and ACh receptors (Olivera et al. 1999).
Conus striatus is a fish-hunting snail indigenous to the Indo-Pacific region.
Venom samples were "milked" from the snails and were further diluted during
experiments. Voltage-dependent K' currents were recorded from frog sympathetic
ganglia (SG) neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. When applied to the
bathing solution, the venom was found to induce a reduction in Ig during a voltage step.
This reduction was evident at venom dilution levels equivalent approximately eight times
higher than those shown to elicit repetitive action potentials in frog nerve-muscle
preparations (Schulz and Gilly, unpublished results). It is thus possible that the block of
voltage-gated K' channels in frog SG neurons by the venom component may be involved
in this neuroexcitatory activity.
