pharmacological blockers specific for each. This would help to narrow down the probable
channel type that this venom component could be targeting.
Originally, the frog SG neurons were chosen as an assay to study C. striatus
venom sensitivity in order to correlate channel block with the spontaneous firing effect
evoked by application of 100 nM concentrations of Conus peptide to the frog nerve-
muscle prep (Craig et al., 1998). It has been reported that simply blocking delayed
rectifier Ig in the SG neurons is not enough to induce spontaneous action potential
generation (Goh, Kelly and Pennefather, 1989). Ã–ther K channels that are activated
closer to membrane resting potential (IM and IAHp) must be modified to induce this effect
(Adams and Galvan, 1986). However, the possibility still exists that this K blocker effect
could be important for inducing such an effect. Further studies will have to focus on
eliminating these other K currents from the recordings using their known
pharmacological blockers (Block and Jones, 1996). While the milked venom was active
at a 1:1000 dilution, a dilution of-1:8000 has been shown to induce spontaneous firing in
the frog muscle preparation. This eight-fold difference is not too large to rule out an
overlapping effect for K channel block and spontaneous firing. Again, however, the long
delay that was observed that seems to be necessary for block of Ig is not consistent with a
rapidly-immobilizing excitotoxic shock effect produced by a C. striatus strike on its prey.
Similar to the effect of Conus venom, it was reported that dendrotoxins shown to block
SG Ig were also not easily washed out and took time to show an effect (Harvey and
Anderson, 1985). It is possible that this Conus toxic effect is working in secondary
manner to other active peptides also present in the venom. This multiple-target venom
attack would then be much like the secondary effect of dendrotoxins on Kchannels that
