Acknowledgements
1 would like to thank Professor Gilly for his commitment to all of his students in
the course and drive to emphasize the importance of proper experimentation and data
analysis in the pursuit of knowledge. His influence throughout this experience will have a
lasting impression throughout my lifetime in all future work.
Dr. Joseph Schulz was a constant source of guidance and consultation throughout
this quarter. He made this project possible, and allowed me to see the light at the end of
the tunnel during the tough times.
Mat Brock was extremely helpful in providing crucial technical support in the
face of many ominous problems.
Josh Rosenthal is a funny guy. Go Sixers.
