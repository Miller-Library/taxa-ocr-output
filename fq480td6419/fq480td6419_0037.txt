Figure 4: Concentration dependence of steady-state Ix block.
A) Ix at +20 mV in the presence of 1:500 dilution of Conus venom. 80% of steady
state Ig blocked at 12:05 minutes after venom application.
B) Different cell Ig at +20 mV in the presence of 1:1000 dilution of Conus
venom. 44% of steady-state Ix was blocked 16:46 minutes after venom
application.
Figure 5: Time course of Ig block at two relative venom concentrations.
A) Steady-state Ig at different times was measured relative to that at venom
application (time 0) at a constant voltage for three different cells at a venom
concentration of 1:500. Block of Ix levels off at a constant level of about 20% of
control. 50% of maximal block occurs at around 150-200 seconds.
B) Same procedure followed with three cells exposed to 1:1000 venom
concentration. One cell (gray squares) was monitored in the presence of 10 mM
SNDIT. Block of Ix levels off at a constant level of about 40% of control. 50% of
maximal block occurs at about 320 seconds.
Figure 6: S-Nitrosodithiothreietol does not modify sympathetic ganglia Ik.
Ig at control and in the presence of 10 mM SNDTT do not show differences in
current amplitude or kinetics. Ix is blocked by 55% in the presence of 1:1000
venom concentration.
