Review of Conus venom effects on voltage-gated
sodium and potassium channels
Venomous gastropods of genus Conus
One of the most dangerous and unlikely predators in the ocean is presented to us
in the form of a snail. Cone snails are marine gastropods (Class Gastropoda, Order
Neogastropoda, Superfamily Toxoglossa, Family Conidae) that have found their
ecological niche in the coral reef habitat and proliferated greatly in the past 55 million
years, growing to a size of about 500 different species as possibly the largest single
marine genus.
An unequivocal reason for the adaptive success and radiation of Conus is present
in its employment of neurotoxins as a method of prey capture, escape from and defense
against predators, and deterrent of competitors. These toxins are small, structurally
constrained peptides of 12-30 amino acid residues in length held together by several
internal disulfide bonds. Conotoxins have evolved to select targets comprised of specific
voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-linked receptors and act to disrupt
normal neuronal communication (Olivera, 1997). Currently, researchers have identified
10 major classes of Conus peptides, each targeting a different aspect of the neuronal
communication process including K, Na', Ca", and ACh receptors (Mclntosh et al.,
1999
Studies of the molecular genetics of toxin genes in Conus species has shown that
gene duplication and selection for diversity are resulting in functionally variable
conotoxins which are further linked to the evolutionary spread and success of the genus
(Duda and Palumbi, 1998). Furthermore, it has been postulated that in the more complex
