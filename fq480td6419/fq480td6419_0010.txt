channel blockers tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) and produces similar effects
(Fainzilber et al., 1995). However, mutagenesis studies have shown that each of the three
toxins have distinct binding sites. It has been postulated that a specific arginine residue
(RI3) of the toxin is critical for activity of u-GIIIA and that the guanidinium side chain
of R13 is analogous to the critical guanidino groups of TTX and STX (Dudley et al.,
1995). Complete block of Na' current with u-conotoxin GIIIA is possible at nanomolar
concentrations. u-GIIIA has a structural rigidity that makes it a good candidate for
probing pairwise interplay between toxin and channel amino acids. Interactions between
specific channel and toxin residues have allowed limited mapping of the outer vestibule
architecture of the voltage-gated Na" channel. Such an approach is valuable, because
ascertaining the structure of large membrane proteins like ion channels has been hindered
by problems with application of procedures like NMR, and x-ray crystallography
(Chahine et al., 1998). lon channel structure and function will be better understood in the
future as a result of such studies. This understanding of the topography of the channel
should also facilitate drug design.
Another variety of u-conotoxin has been isolated from C. purpurascens, u-PIIIA,
that shows different target specificity than that of u-GIIIA. Arginine-14 is a key residue
for u-PIIIA, with substitution by alanine abolishing Na" channel-blocking activity. uÂ¬
PIIIA irreversibly blocks amphibian muscle Na' channels but not those in motor nerves,
making it a useful tool in synaptic electrophysiology. Type II Na channels from the
mammalian CNS expressed in Xenopus oocytes, which are TTX-sensitive, were
reversibly blocked by u-PIIIA, whereas they were unaffected by u-GIIIA. Additionally,
