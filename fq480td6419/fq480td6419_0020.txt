venom application indicates that Kvl channels are not being targeted in these SG
neurons.
Sympathetic ganglia K currents targeted by venom component are TEA sensitive
When 10 mM TEA was applied to neurons of similar size and with similar K
current kinetics to venom-sensitive neurons from previous studies (Fig 7A), a decrease in
steady-state current to approximately 20% of control was seen (Fig. 7B). This TEAÂ¬
sensitive current, which has been previously described as delayed rectifier current in SG
neurons (Klemic, Durand and Jones, 1998), would seem to correlate very closely with
Conus venom-sensitive Ig. In the Klemic study TEA-sensitive channels showed 50%
activation between -10 mV and 0 mV. Venom sensitive cells also activated within a
similar range (Fig. 2AB, 3B). These results point to delayed rectifier Ig as the probable
target of the Conus venom component.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that a component of the venom of Conus striatus blocks
Ix in frog sympathetic ganglia neurons. The mechanism of this block seems to involve
the direct interaction of the venom component with K channels in a manner that is very
similar to the block of delayed rectifier channels in frog SG by externally applied
tetraethylammonium ions as described by Goh et al. (1989). Similarly, this block, which
seems to target the non-inactivating, delayed rectifier-type K currents in SG cells has
been observed with a class of snake venoms, the dendrotoxins (Anderson and Harvey,
1985).
