Figure 1: Basic venom effect. Externally applied Conus venom causes time-dependent
block of frog sympathetic ganglia K channels. Ig evoked by 25 ms
depolarizations to +20 mV in the absence (control) and presence of venom.
Figure 2: Conus venom does not alter the K conductance versus voltage relationship.
A) Conductance (G) is measured and normalized to Gmax for all traces within a
voltage series at control and following 1:1000 venom application using the
equation G= I/(V-Vg) where Vx is the reversal potential for Ix measured by tail
currents for each individual cell. G.venon is calculated following subtraction of all
Ix unaffected by venom from the control Ig levels so that only venom sensitive G
is measured.
B) Same set of calculations performed for a cell at 1:500 venom concentration.
Variation is seen between the two cells in voltage at 50% conductance, but not
within each cell at Gcontrol VS. G4venomÂ¬
Figure 3: Venom block of Ix occurs in a voltage-independent manner.
A) The current versus voltage relationship is measured between Icontol and Lavenom
traces. Block of Ig appears to be independent of voltage, as the voltages for 50%-
activation are about equal (approximately -5 mV).
B) Relative conductance measured in the same cell. Same set of calculations as
performed in Fig. 2 A,B. Conductance in this cell was nearly identical with and
without venom present.
