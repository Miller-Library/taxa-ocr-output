venom batteries of Conus species there may be over 100 different peptides present, each
of which may be unique to that species as a means of prey capture (Olivera et al., 1995).
An adept system of conotoxin delivery into both prey and possible enemies is
based on a highly sophisticated venom production-apparatus and delivery system. The
cone snail employs chemical and tactile sensory systems in its extensible proboscis to
locate and track targets, and then "harpoons" it's victim using a specialized barbed radula
tooth that is tethered to its proboscis. The radula tooth at the distal end of a venom duct
acts to spear and hypodermically envenom the prey (Kohn, 1956). The proximal end of
the duct emerges from a muscular bulb-like structure.
To be a successful predator, each of the 500 different species of cone snail has
developed an arsenal of conotoxin peptides geared specifically toward incapacitation of
their specific prey items. For example, fish-eating (piscivorous) cones use a battery of
peptides evoking “excitotoxic shock" in their victim through the combination of a ô¬
conotoxin that increases sodium-channel conductance while a complementary k-
conotoxin blocks potassium-channel conductance. This typically produces a strong
depolarization in poisoned nerve processes leading to repetitive firing and disruption of
coordinated locomotion by the fish. Meanwhile, a different group of toxins in the same
venom cocktail acts synergistically on different target cell types to inhibit neuromuscular
transmission and muscular contraction, thereby paralyzing the fish. These are the o¬
conotoxin PIVA, which targets the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and u-conotoxin
PIIIA, which blocks skeletal muscle sodium channels. Together, this combination of
peptides very quickly renders the fish helpless and enables the slow-moving snail to catch
its faster prey (Terlau et al., 1996).
