Further studies have shown that Ig in these cells was found to be insensitive to
externally applied S-nitrosodithiothreitol (SNDTT), a compound that shows a high
degree of specificity for block of the Kvl subfamily (Brock, Mathes, and Gilly, 1997).
Additionally, the venom-sensitive current was found to overlap with that blocked by
externally applied tetraethylammonium (TEA), which has been shown to selectively
inhibit delayed rectifier (DR) Ix in frog SG neurons (Spruce et al., 1987 and Klemic, et
al., 1998).
Together, these results suggest the existence of a previously undescribed blocker
of DR Ix in C. striatus venom which functions in a manner most similar to snake-derived
dendrotoxins in frog peripheral neurons (Anderson and Harvey, 1985) and is not
targeting Kvl-type channels.
Introduction
Peptidic components of the venoms of predatory Conus species have been used in
previous studies to characterize external regions of ion channels because of the great
affinity and specificity they show for binding sites. Many of these conopeptides target
voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels, as well as the acetylcholine receptor. In this
study, voltage-gated K channels were affected by some component of the raw venom of
Conus striatus in a way that has not been previously described. An active component in
this venom induces a reduction in steady-state Ig in frog SG very similar to that seen with
externally applied tetraethylammonium (TEA) (Spruce et al., 1987), as well as by snakeÂ¬
venom derived dendrotoxins in the peripheral nervous system (Anderson and Harvey,
1985).
