An increased understanding of the various K channel types seen in frog SG
neurons has emerged from the experiments performed in this study. In one cell the
application of 1:500 dilution venom showed no effect of K channel block (Fig. 5A). This
cell, designated with “60 pF cell", covered approximately twice as much surface area as
all other cells tested. The range for venom sensitive cells was from 20-35 pF. These
results suggest that different, venom-insensitive K channels exist in very large SG
neurons. The general insensitivity of the large, 60 pF cell to the venom component
suggests that at least two types of non-inactivating K channel types are present in the
ganglia, and can be distinguished based on cell size. This also fits into the categorical
designation of at least two "B" and one “C" cell types seen in the frog SG (Dodd and
Horn, 1983). Furthermore, the results involving K current insensitivity to externally
applied 10 mM SNDTT suggest that the Kvl family subtype is not present, at least in any
quantifiable amount, in these small, venom-sensitive SG neurons. This result is
interesting, as it has been shown that dendrotoxins have been found that are specific both
for Kyl channels and peripheral nervous system K currents in rat dorsal root ganglia
(Stansfelf and Feltz, 1988). Further studies should proceed with examining the sensitivity
of various Kyl channel clones to the venom component, to draw more conclusions about
the relation between this active component and dendrotoxins.
An apparent correlation between TEA- and venom-sensitive K currents was also
presented in this study. This is interesting in its implication that the venom component is
targeting delayed rectifier-type channels in the frog SG. Future studies would concentrate
on eliminating the IAHP, IM, and Ca“-activated channels from recordings using
