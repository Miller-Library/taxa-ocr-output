Dendrotoxins are small peptides isolated from the venom of the snake mamba
genus, Dendroaspis. Originally, it was found that the venom of the green mamba,
Dendroaspis augusticeps, contained a toxin that increased quantal release of
acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to excitotoxic paralysis. Additional
dendrotoxins have been shown to selectively block K channels, including cloned
members of the Kvl subfamily, with high affinity. These have made them useful in
studies of K channel structure and physiology (Harvey, 2000). The selective block of
DR channels in the frog peripheral nervous system by dendrotoxins is very similar to that
seen with C. striatus venom and frog SG Ix reduction. Building on this, experimental
evidence in this paper shows that Ix in SG neurons tested were insensitive to SNDTT, a
compound that selectively blocks the Kvl subfamily of K channels (Brock, Mathes and
Gilly, 1997). This suggests that those channels affected in the SG neurons are not of the
Kvl type.
These results point to the existence of a previously undescribed blocker of frog
SG K currents that acts specifically on TEA-sensitive DR channels.
Methods
Preparation of venom
C. striatus venom was obtained by the "milking" procedure. This technique was
performed by attracting the snail's attention with a fishtail fragment attached to a latex
membrane covering a small Eppendorf tube. Following the snail strike and injection of
venom through the fish tail and membrane, the tube was pulled from the animal. The
contents were then centrifuged and stored at -70'C along with a pool of venom collected
