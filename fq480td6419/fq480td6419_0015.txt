Previous work showed that application of a 100 nM concentration of peptide
purified from C. striatus venom induced repetitive activity in frog neuromuscular prep
and repetitive action potentials when applied to frog sympathetic ganglion neurons (Craig
et al., 1998). In the same study, this peptide was also presented as a blocker of Shaker K-
channels at a concentration of 2.5 M, which led investigators to propose K channel
block as a means of modifying action potentials in the peripheral nervous system. It was
hypothesized that K channel block in the sympathetic ganglia could be the mechanism
by which spontaneous activity in the neuromuscular prep was being produced.
Other studies focusing on K currents in frog SG have also explored block of Ik
and its relationship to action potential firing activity. Up to five distinct voltage-activated
K channels have been identified in frog SG cells. Together, all five can act to produce
hyperpolarization and repolarize the action potential. Each, however, has a conductance
of a different size, speed and voltage threshold and act together to create cell electric
properties (Adams and Galvan, 1986). Studies using 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) (Goh,
Kelly, and Pennefather, 1989) as a specific blocker of DR Ig in SG neurons have pointed
to a mechanism in which channel block of this type leads to attenuation of action
potential spikes in a train of repetitive firing. Block of DR Ix by TEA leads to spike
broadening in the SG, as repolarization is inhibited (Spruce et al., 1987). The block of Ix
by these compounds alone, however, does not seem to be sufficient to initiate repetitive
firing in the SG neuron, as models have shown that IM (current with muscarine
antagonist) and IAHP (K current after hyperpolarization) are more likely responsible for
this mechanism because of their greater activation at more-negative membrane potentials
(Adams et al., 1986).
