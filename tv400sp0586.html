INTRODUCTION
Studies on polychaetes have included investigations
of many aspects of regeneration. Older papers such as
Berrill (1928, 1931, 1936) and Faulkner (1932) are reviewed
Many exciting dis¬

coveries have been made, including the elucidation of a
neurohormone gradient thought to be responsible for the
retention of polarity (Fitzharris, 1973).
Nevertheless, there remain large gaps in the infor-
mation available on polychaete regeneration. The process
has not even been looked at in many species of polychaetes.
One such species is <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Dorvillea moniloceras : Exact'>Dorvillea moniloceras,</span> family Dor¬
villeidae, which is found intertidally and subtidally
on the coast of Monterey, California.
In this study, the regenerative capabilities of
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>D. moniloceras</span> were investigated in order to answer the
following three questions. Can both posterior and ant-
erior regeneration take place? What events take place
before full regeneration is attained? Does the position
along the body at which a worm is cut affect either the
ability to regenerate or the rate of regeneration?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was done at Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California during
April and May of 1976. A large population of D. monilo-
eras was found at the marina at Monterey Harbor,
Regeneration in Dorvillea

underneath the boat docks, specifically among tunicates
and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phyllochaetopterus : Exact'>Phyllochaetopterus</span> tubes. After collection, the worms
were stored in seawater in fingerbowls set in a bath of
running seawater at 14-16° C. All sizes of worms were
used as experimental animals.
After at most a day or two in the laboratory, the
worms were cut. The procedure was to place the worms
in a solution of MgCl, isotonic with seawater, for 15
minutes prior to cutting. The cut was then made with
a razor blade on the posterior side of the desired segment.
The position of the cut was recorded. Both front and
rear pieces of the worm were stored together for the
duration of the experiment. At first the containers used
were glass tubes with plankton netting secured at both
ends, placed in running seawater. No antibiotics were
used. This arrangement allowed an accumulation of
phytoplankton and bacteria which resulted in an abnormally
high mortality rate. Keeping worms in five inch diameter
fingerbowls half filled with seawater proved to be a good
alternative. The bowls were set in a bath of running
seawater and maintained at temperatures ranging from
14-16° C. The water in the bowls was changed daily.
If a worm regenerated to the stage where it could
eat and defacate normally, a tunicate and hydroids were
placed in the bowl to give it an opportunity to feed and
resume a morghatural existence. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hydroids : Exact'>(Hydroids</span> represent a

common natural food of D. moniloceras according to Marshall,
1976.) The rest of the worms were not fed but it is
possible thy could have eaten plankton and diatoms which
came in with the unfiltered running seawater.
Four groups of worms were divided into anterior
and posterior portions according to three plans. In the
first two groups, worms were cut transversely in either
the anterior region, middle region, or posterior region.
The worms in the third group were cut at levels just
posterior to 20%, 40%, 60% or 80% of their total number
of setigerous segments. Worms in the fourth group were
cut just after segment 15, 30, 45, or 60. This cutting
strategy yielded 63 anterior and 63 posterior pieces of
worms in assorted sizes. The groups were cut at inter¬
vals of one or two weeks so that, at any one time, several
stages of regeneration would be observable.
Table 1 shows the sizes of the resulting pieces of
worms, the day on which they were cut (after "day zero"),
and the length of time they survived out of a total of
41 days the the experiment was run. Six worms from the
first series of cuts are not included in the calculations
due to a lack of accurate data.
The worms were observed daily under a dissecting
microscope. Data were recorded on each worm, noting the
stages to which the worm had progressed. These data
appear in Tables 2A, 2B, and Figure 1.

OSTERIOR REGENERATION--Results
The process of posterior regeneration was divided
into stages marked by distinct morphological events. A
description of each stage follows, and sketches are shown
on Figure 2.
Stage 1. A piece of the orange gut protruded from
the cut end; the worms otherwise appeared and behaved
normally. The last segment before the cut was constricted,
thereby closing down the area of the wound and giving
the end a "gathered" appearance. Also because of the
constriction the parapodia on the last segment were rotated
toward the rear till they occupied the position of the
anal cirri which had been removed.
tage 2. This stage was marked by a healing of the
cut resulting in a flat, colorless posterior end with no
gut opening visible. In some cases, food material present
in the gut was eliminated by rupture through the lateral
body wall; those individuals in which this occurred died
within a few days.
tage 3. This stage was characterized by the formation
of a red pigmented bump on the healed end.
Stage 4. The formation of an anus on the dorsalside
of the bump usually characterized this stage.
Stage 5. Onset of the fifth stage was marked bythe
appearance of anal cirri at the posterior end. Two of
these colorless projections formed ventrally and two
dorsally on the pygidium.

Stage 6. The first clear appearance of a new segment
at the anterior end of the regenerating tail marked the
beginning of stage six. The new segment was formed posterior
to the last original segment, and remained separated from
the column of tissue which was externally unsegmented,
although sometimes small transverse wrinkles in the cuticle
could be seen. Red pigment was found along the dorsal
side of most of the new tail, with the greatest concen-
tration occurring farthest from the pygidium.
Stage 7. This stage was defined by the appearance
of parapodia on the first new segment. The segments in
the column of tissue between the new segment with parapodia
and the pygidium were distinct, and the amount of pigment
in the whole new tail increased.
Stage 8. In the eighth stage, parapodia were present
on all new segments. The characteristic pattern of two
transverse red bands per segment appeared on the first
several new tail segments while those segments nearest
the pygidium appeared solid red. Additional segments
were generated immediately anterior to the pygidium.
The total mean time to complete posterior regeneration
through stage eight was 26.2 days.
POS
ERIOR REGENERATION--Discussion
Some of the physical changes accompanying regeneration
warrant special attention. In Stage 1, the last segment
constricts, closing down the area of the wound, and in
so doing the parapodia are rotated toward the rear, ending
up in the orientation of the original anal cirri. Based
Cowan -16
Regeneration in Dorvillea
on observation of living animals it appears that they
temporarily serve the function of those cirri, indicating
to the worm whether or not something is behind it when
it walks backwards, as it often does.
Also deserving of comment is the origin of the tissues
which make up the regenerated parts. According to the
results of Hill (1969), the regeneration blastema
most
likely originates from differentiated tissues adjacent to
the wound. These tissues representing cells derived from
all three germ layers, de-differentiate from their previous
state and then re-differentiate into the cell types appro-
priate to reconstructing the missing parts.
The sequence of events represented by Stages 1-8
was followed in a majority of cases. However, some vari¬
ation was noted, particularly with respect to Stage 3.
In 12 out of 23 cases, a bump characterized by pigmentation
and lacking an anal opening, formed on the end of the
healed segment as outlined. However, in seven cases,
following Stage 2 an opening was present on the bump as
soon as it appeared at the beginning of Stage 3. And
in four instances an opening formed on the end of the
about
last segment at"the end of Stage 2, where little or no
bump at all was present. It seems that the appearance
of an anal opening to the gut is an important step toward
full regeneration. At this point the posterior end of the
gut is functional, although not morphologically complete,
Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -17
and the worm now has a way to defacate. This markedly
increases a worm's chances of survival and full regeneration,
as evidenced by the data in Table 2A and Figure 1.
ERIOR REGENERATION--Rates
All regenerating animals were examined daily five
to seven days a week and rated as to stage, so the length
of time each animal spent at each stage was a matter of
record. The duration of each stage in posterior regeneration
for the population of experimental animals proved highly
variable (Table 3), but this variation involved only a
few individuals (Figure 3).
ANTERIOR REGENERATION--Results
The process of anterior regeneration (formation of
a new head end) was also divided into stages defined by
specific events. The stages recognized are outlined below
and sketches are shown in Figure 1.
Stages 1 and 2. The first two stages of anterior
regeneration were morphologicall similar to those recog-
nized in posterior regeneration, the differences being
behavioral; Stage 1 was characterized by an open wound
revealing tissues constricted around the orange gut; in
Stage 2 the wound was healed. The hind pieces of cut
worms retained their polarity in locomotion (they crawled
with their anterior ends first), and they consistently
righted themselves when turned on their dorsal sides.

However, they were generally much less active than the
anterior pieces. The parapodia of the segment just back
of the cut were rotated to the front by the constriction
of the anterior segment and occupied somewhat the posi¬
tions of palps and antennae.
Stage 3. In the third stage of regeneration a re-
tractable bulge appeared on the healed surface. As in
the original prostomium, there was no pigmentation. The
worms jerked back quickly when poked in this region, and
the level of activity observed in the worms increased
at this atage.
Stage 4. The distinctive feature of this stage
was an anterior opening to the gut, a mouth, formed in
the lower portion of the bulge. When the bulge was extended,
the opening was at the tip. At this stage, the worm
regained its normal level of activity and resumed the
characteristic behavior of an entire worm. Worms in this
stage were often observed to drag the bulge, fully extended
and pointed downward, along the bottom of the fingerbowl.
One gained the impression that feeding could be taking
place.
Stage 5. This stage was defined by the appearance
of an invagination formed in the ventral half of the bulge
at the opening to the gut. At this stage the bulge was
large enough so that the parapodia resumed their original
orientation and the "gathered"appearance disappeared.
tage 6. This stage was characterized by the forma¬
tion of rudimentary jaws posterior to the opening. The
-24
Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -25
red-brown cylindrical jaw buds moved in and out of the
small mouth opening in the same manner as the fully
developed jaws in a normal worm.
Furthur stages of prostomial development were not
available for observation at 34 days. The total mean
time for regeneration up to Stage 6 was 19.4 days.
ERIOR RFCENET
TION--Discussion
EGENEF
As in posterior regeneration, it seems that the para¬
podia on the last segment anterior to the cut, temporarily
serve the function of the missing appendages. In this
case, they are oriented in the former positions of the
palps and antennae, and apparently serve as sensory appendages.
In support of this statement, these parapodia were out
of synchrony with the rest of the parapodia while they
occupied the anterior position.
The appearance of the opening in the head bulge
presented an interesting possibility. It seemed that
with this development the worm was able to ingest small
food particles. Although worms were never directly
observed taking in particles, they exhibited apparent
feeding behavior by dragging the bulge, pointed downward
and fully extended, along the bottom of the fingerbowl.
The increased probability of regeneration after this
stage supports the possibility that the worms were no
longer relying on reserves, but that they were capable of
ingesting food. (Table 2B and Figure 1.)
C
Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -26

REGENERATION--Rate
ANTERIOR I
As in the case of posterior regeneration, daily
observations of the stage of development of each regen¬
erating fragment allowed calculation of rates of anterior
regeneration. Means and ranges for the duration of each
stage appear in Table 4, and variation appears in Figure 5.
RELATION BETWEEN REGENERATION RATE AND NUMBER OE SEGMENTS
It seemed possible that capacity to regenerate and
speed of regeneration might be related to the size of
the regenerating fragment. With this in mind data were
analyzed to determine the duration of Stage 1 in relation
to fragment size. Data are shown in Table 5.
The results in Table 5 suggest an inverse correlation
between the number of segments in a piece of worm and
the time it takes for regeneration to occur. Worms with
1-20 segments developed significantly more slowly (p..05)
than those with 45 or more segments, for the first stage
of regeneration. The relationship of the subsequent
stages could not be deduced because of the large die-off
of worms containing 1-20 segments.
A determination of the limiting number of segments
necessary for regeneration to occur was not the objective
of this study, although results bearing on this question
were obtained. At the time of writing, posterior regenera¬
tion was observed through the eighth stage in a worm
containing the head and only nine setigerous segments.

Anterior regeneration through stage four occurred in a
worm containing only 19 segments. A middle section of
worm containing 38 segments had, at the time of writing,
regenerated a pygidium, one new segment, and an opening
to the gut on the prostomial bulge in a period of 34
days.

DISCUSSION
It seems possible that the rate-size correlation
is maintained throughout the regeneration process. Data
are sparse, but two individuals, 9 and 25 segments long,
that were cut on the same day had, at the time of writing
regenerated 6 and 11 segments,respectively.
EVIDENCE OE INJURY AND REGENERATION IN A NATURAL POPULATION
The preceeding study indicates that D. moniloceras
regenerates quite effectively. A survey of a natural
population of 103 worms revealed that 13 of them (12.6%)
were regenerating or showed signs of previous damage
and repair. Six worms had regenerated a pygidium, two
were regenerating a palp, two were regenerating an antenna,
and threehad irregular body markings which suggested
the possibility of previous regeneration.
SUMMARY
Regeneration, both posterior and anterior, are
1)
observed in D. moniloceras.
2) The continuous process of regeneration, both
anterior and posterior, can be broken up into various
Regeneration in Dorvillea
Cowan -32
changes in
stages, marked byAthe appearance of the cut end. Follow-
ing are the stages recognized in posterior regeneration:
1) wound open; 2) wound healed, but flat; 3)central
protrusion, pigmented; 4) anal aperture forms; 5) anal
cirri appear; 6) new segment delimited; 7) parapodia
form on new segment, other smaller segments form; 8) para-
podia on all new segments. Somewhat similar stages can
be recognized in anterior regeneration: 1) wound open;
2)wound healed; 3) non-pigmented bulge forms on cut
end; 4) mouth opening forms in bulge; 5) invagination
in bulge forms at opening; 6) jaws appear.
3) Posterior regeneration through Stage 8 occurred
in a worm with a head and 9 chaetigers. Anterior regener¬
ation to Stage 4 was observed in a worm with 19 segments
and a pygidium. A midsection of a worm 38 segments long
regenerated a pygidium and one new segment posteriorly,
and a beginninghof a new prostomium anteriorly.
4) An inverse correlation seems to exist between
the number of segments in a piece of worm and the length
of time necessary for regeneration.

whose help this paper would still
be a rough draft, and to Mr. Chuck
Baxter for his sympathy on the

no sign of regeneration.
