establish that TRPM7 is a viable means of Ca“ flux. Three subsequent experiments were
designed to probe the effect of extracellular Mg“ on Ca flux through TRPM7. Trials
involved a dose-gradient in order to best articulate the relationship between Ca“ flux and
extracellular Mg“ concentration. We found that Mg- blocks Ca* flux through TRPM7
in a concentration dependent fashion.
In the first experiment involving Mg“, we found that the fluorescence decreased
consistently with the addition of extracellular Mg“ and concluded that Mg" does block
the influx of Ca through TRPM7. Furthermore, the final fluorescence (Ffinal) was found
to decrease proportionally to the increase of Mg- concentration across trials. Uninduced
control cells also showed a decrease in Ffinal in response to the addition of Mg“, but on a
much smaller scale. The clarity of concentration dependence suggested the usefulness of
a graph depicting the relationship between Mg“ concentration and the percent blockage
experienced by the TRPM7 channels (fig. 8a).
The percent block graph provides some indication of the permeation mechanism
involving TRPM7, Ca flux and changing extracellular Mg- concentrations. If it is
assumed that the block is due to a single binding site on the channel, then Eyring rate
theory would predict an exponential curve reaching a horizontal asymptote as the
mechanism approaches 100% saturation. In this scenario, the Mg“ concentration that
causes a half-block, or 50% channel saturation, would be considered the dissociation
constant, or Kd, for that binding site. Although our study does not avail itself to
definitive results in this regard, we can begin to reveal an exponential trend in the percent
block graph and note a possible half-block at 100 uM Mg“. Using voltage clamp
techniques to study Na’ influx through TRPM7 in the absence of intracellular Mg?
