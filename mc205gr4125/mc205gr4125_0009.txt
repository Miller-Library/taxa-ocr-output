buffered saline, fluorescence values of AF/ Fo increased.07 units (n-10 cells) following
perfusion with 2mM Ca“/OmM Mg- buffered saline solution. The same cells showed an
increase in AF/Fo of.2 units (n=10 cells), .25 units (n=10 cells) and .22 units (n=10 cells)
when buffered in 2mM Ca“7.02 mM Mg“, 2mM Ca/.2mM Mg* and 2mM Ca21/2mM
Mg“ buffered saline, respectively, following perfusion with 2mM Ca/OmM Mg
buffered saline solution (fig. 6a). This increase in fluorescence indicates a increase in
internal [Ca“. We can infer that the increase in internal [Ca2 is due to Ca2 influx
through TRPM7 because the uninduced control cells do not show an much increase in
fluorescence. The control cells in this experiment produced values of AF/ Fo that did not
deviate beyond +-.03 (n—4 trials) (fig. 6b).
