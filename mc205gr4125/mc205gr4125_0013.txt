or Kd of the binding site, should be made by measuring over a greater range of Mg?
concentrations. A more detailed dose-dependent graph will more accurately depict the
nature of ion-ion interactions at the binding site. Also, voltage clamp measurement of
Ca“ current is necessary to validate our correlation of intracellular Ca accumulation
and Ca“ flux through TRPM7, to better elucidate the properties of individual channel
and to approximate the number of channels involved in each experiment.
Conclusions:
In the absence of Mg“, TRPM7 does act as a Ca“ channel. We can further
conclude that external Mg- blocks Ca" influx and efflux through TRPM7 channels in a
dose-dependent fashion. We have estimated that the half block or possible Kd is between
100 and 500 uM of Mg“. We can further hypothesize that it is the interaction of Mg* at
the binding site(s) of the channel that is slowing or blocking movement of Ca“ through
TRPM7. Most broadly, we can propose that TRPM7 play a role in Mg* and Ca
homeostasis in the cell.
