function of TRPM7 may help in understanding Ca and Mg- homeostasis and the
pathology that results from disturbance of metal homeostasis.
Electrophysiological studies have concluded that TRPM7 is a nonselective cation
channel permeable to most mono and divalent cations (e.g. Kerschbaum et al. 2003),
however when divalent cations are present in the external solution TRPM7 only passes
divalent cations. We propose that TRPM7 may be a calcium channel that can be forced
to pass monovalent cations under the artificial conditions required for voltage clamp
studies. While voltage clamp studies have provided valuable information that has
ultimately led to the current four barrier, three well Eyring rate theory model of the
channel pore, little is known about the channel’s behavior under more physiologically
relevant conditions. Our study examines the behavior of TRPM7 in the presence of
physiologically appropriate levels of Ca and Mg. Our results indicate that TRPM7
functions as a calcium channel in solutions that approximate normal physiological
conditions. We further demonstrate that magnesium blocks Ca“ flux through TRPM7 in
a dose dependant manner.

Cell Culture
Up-regulation of TRPM7 expression was achieved using the A10 cell line
generously provided by A. Sharenberg. A10 cells were created from human embryonic
kidney (HEK-293) cells stably transfected with murine TRPM7/pCDNA under the
control of a tetracycline-inducible promotor. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
