Imaging
The Ca“ indicator dye fluo3/AM (Molecular Probes) increases in fluorescence
when bound to intracellular Ca“. Cells in 2mM Ca“ buffered saline solution were
loaded with fluo-3 (2.5uL/ml external solution) and gently agitated for 40 min. Cells
were then washed with fresh 2mM Ca“ saline at least 20 min before the start of imaging.
The concentration of Ca“ inside the cell was visualized using an Olympus Fluoview 300
laser scanning microscope with a UPLFL 20x lens (fig. 2).
For viewing under the microscope, coverslips were transferred individually to a
plexiglass perfusion chamber that held Icc of saline solution. A perfusion system
consisting of a lcc syringe with attached microtubing delivered the experimental
solutions to the plexiglass chamber and excess solution was drawn off using a vacuum
pump. Solution changes were made over the course of 60 seconds. Data was collected
every 4 seconds for a total 240 seconds.
Data Analysis
Individual cells were defined as regions of interest (ROIs) using Fluoview
Physiology 4.1 (Tiempo Physiology). Isolated cells or cells with few confluent neighbors
were chosen in order to minimize complications due to cell-cell interactions. Typically
ten regions of interest were defined for each trial. Measurements of fluorescence
intensity over time in each ROI were made using Fluoview Physiology. We used Igor
Pro version 4.01 (Wave Metrics) to create graphs of fluorescence versus time for
individual ROIs and for the average of all ROIs in each trial. In order to compare graphs
from different trials and to account for differences in dye loading across trials, we
