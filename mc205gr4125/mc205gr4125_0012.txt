possible Kd of 1 uM has been proposed (Kerschbaum et al. 2003). Although the current
study differs significantly in design, the two results are not in obvious contradiction.
In the second experiment of the series, the Mg“ block was removed and Ca was
better able to pass through TRPM7 channels. Values of Ffinal were seen to increase in a
Mg“ concentration dependent manner. A percent block graph was designed and the half-
block or possible Kd was determined to be 500 uM Mg (fig. 8b). Control trials reflected a
similar increasing trend on a smaller scale. Some deviation from the trend may be
explained by experimental error. If this deviation appears consistently, however, it may
be an indication of more complicated ion-ion interactions at the binding site. It is also
notable that trials involving Ca“ influx appear to show more inconsistency between cells
than trials involving Ca“ efflux (fig. 9). This inconsistency may be due to variability in
the cell cycle and the mechanisms that regulate internal stores and intracellular
concentrations of Ca and Mg.
In the third experiment of the series, in which various extracellular concentrations
of Mg“ were held constant while Ca“ was removed, results showed a sharp decrease in
fluorescence. In addition, the amount of change in fluorescence decreased as the
concentration of Mg“ was increased. That is to say, higher Mg- concentrations meant
more blocking and less intracellular Ca“ available for efflux through TRPM7 at the start
of the experiment. Again, Ca“ flux was found to be dependent on the concentration of
extracellular Mg¬t.
From this study alone we cannot define a permeation mechanism but we have
established a clear line of inquiry for future investigation. Exemplary trials should be
replaced by averages across many trials. An attempt to determine the value of half-block,
