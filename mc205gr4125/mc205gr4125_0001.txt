Abstract:
Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a widely expressed,
constituatively active, voltage independent ion channel known to be permeable to most
divalent and monovalent cations. TRPM7 may play an important role in Ca, Mgr, and
trace metal homeostasis. Our study examines the behavior of TRPM7 under
physiologically relevant conditions. Confocal laser microscopy and the indicator dye
fluo-3/AM allowed for visualization of intracellular Ca“ accumulation in control and
TRPM7 overexpressing HEK-293 cells when exposed to external solutions with varying
concentrations of Ca“ and Mg“. When compared with control cells, TRPM7
overexpressing cells show greater influx and efflux of Ca“ in response to changes in
external Ca“, indicating that TRPM7 functions as a calcium channel under
physiologically appropriate conditions. Our results also indicate that Mg“ interferes with
the movement of Ca“ through the TRPM7 channel. The data further suggest that the
percentage of TRPM7 channels blocked by Mg“ is proportional to the extracellular Mg
concentration. This implies a possible mechanism for ion permeation through TRPM7
that involves ion-ion interactions within the channel protein and implicates TRPM7
channels in Ca“ and Mg homeostasis.
Introduction:
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels were first identified in a drosophila
mutant characterized by photoreceptors that produce abnormally short receptor potentials
in response to light (Montell 2002). The melastatin sub-family of TRP channels is
