showed a decrease in AF/ Fo of 21 units (n=10 cells), .23 units (n=10 cells) and .08 units
(n=10 cells) when buffered in 2mM Ca“/.02mM Mg“, 2mM Ca21/.2mM Mg* and 2mM
Ca“ /2mM Mg buffered saline, respectively, following perfusion with solutions
containing no Ca“ (fig. 7a). This decrease in fluorescence indicates a decrease in
internal [Ca“. We can infer that the decrease in internal [Ca2 is due to Ca2 efflux
through TRPM7 because the uninduced control cells do not show as much decrease in
fluorescence. For control cells, values of AF/ Fo decreased.14 units (n=10 cells), ,03
units (n=10 cells), .03 units (n=10 cells) and .2 units (n=10 cells) following perfusion
with 0 mM Ca“7.002mM Mg“ buffered saline, OmM Ca2/.02mM Mg buffered saline,
OmM Ca7.2mM Mg buffered saline and OmM Ca2/2mM Mg2 buffered saline,
respectively (fig. 7b).
Discussion:
This study uses change in fluorescence intensity to measure Ca“ accumulation in
the cell. The assumption that Ca“ accumulation is due to Ca“ flux through TRPM7 was
based on the historical reliability of the HEK 293 /AlO expression system as well as
correlative evidence provided by control experiments and the experimental design
(Monteilh-Zoller et al. 2003; Kerschbaum 2003; Thompson and Hermosura,
unpublished).
The experimental method employed throughout this study was one in which
extracellular conditions could be altered during fluorescence imaging. This paradigm
allowed us to address two major topics of interest: the second contingent on the first. By
altering the concentration of extracellular Ca“ in the absence of Mg“ we were able to
