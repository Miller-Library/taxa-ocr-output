question (Kasa et al. 1995). Öther research has shown that copper and zinc bind to
amyloid beta, which may explain accumulation of these trace metals in amyloid plaques
(Atwood 2000). Parkinson’s related cell death in the substantial nigra (SN) has been
correlated with high levels of free iron, low levels of the iron-binding protein ferritin,
high levels of zinc, and low levels of copper in SN tissue (Dexter et al. 1992). African
green monkeys with unilateral MPTP-induced parkinsonism showed high concentrations
of Fe“ and Fe" in the substantia nigra compacta on the MPTP-lesioned side, leading
researchers to conclude that high concentrations of unbound iron may be linked to cell
death in the SN (Temlett et al. 1994).
However, pathology associated with trace metal accumulation may be better
explained by high levels of trace metals coupled with low levels of Ca and Mg'
During an epidemic of Parkinson’s-ALS symptoms in Guam in the 1950s, many patients
developed severe dementia and most died within five years of the onset of symptoms;
these Parkinson’s ALS clusters occurred in regions of Guam with high levels of
Aluminum and Manganese coupled with low levels of calcium and magnesium in the soil
and river water (qtd. in Yasui and Garruto 1995). Laboratory studies have shown that
rats fed a diet low in Ca“ and Mg- with or without high aluminum showed increased
aluminum deposition in central nervous system tissue (Yasui and Garruto 1995).
Pathology related to disturbance in trace metal and earth metal homeostasis may
become more prevalent in the future because industrial use of trace metals is increasing.
For example, the fungicides Maneb and Mancozeb and the gasoline additive MMT
(antiknock 33x) all contain manganese. Better understanding of the structure and
