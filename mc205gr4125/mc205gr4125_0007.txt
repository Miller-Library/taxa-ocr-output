calculated a baseline initial fluorescence (Fo) by averaging all the data points collected
before perfusion with a new solution (baseline=O to 20 seconds). We then normalized the
wave by dividing fluorescence at each time point (F) by the initial fluorescence (Fo) to
obtain values of AF/ Fo. Trials in which the same treatment was applied (e.g. removal or
addition of extracellular Ca“) were averaged using Igor Pro. When applicable, the
results are reported as mean value +/- one standard error.
The percent block graphs were designed using the fluorescence intensity of cells
bathed in 0 mM Ca“ saline solution as the hypothetical maximum block of TRPM7.
Percent block was then calculated by comparing fluorescence intensity at the end of each
trial (Ffinal) and plotted on a semilog scale to accommodate the range of Mg?
concentrations studied.
Results:
Response to Changes in Extracellular [Cat 1:
For TET induced TRPM7 overexpressing cells in 2mM Ca2 buffered saline,
initial fluorescence (Fo) calculated from all data points before perfusion (from 0 to 20
seconds) was 0.90 +-.03 (n=12 trials). Values of AF/ Fo decreased to 0.69 +- 0.03
(n=12 trials) following perfusion with the OmM buffered saline solution (fig. 3). This
decrease in fluorescence indicates a decrease in internal [Ca“). We can infer that the
decrease in internal [Ca# is due to Ca“ efflux through TRPM7 because uninduced
control cells showed a much smaller decreased in fluorescence. For control cells, in
2mM Ca“ buffered saline, initial fluorescence (Fo) was 0.99 + 0.01 (n=12 trials).
