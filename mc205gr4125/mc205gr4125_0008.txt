Values of AF/ Fo decreased to 0.96 +-0.01 (n=12 trials) following perfusion with OmM
Ca“ buffered saline (fig. 3).
TET induced cells also show a greater change in internal [Ca“ in response to
addition of external calcium when compared with uninduced control cells. For TET
induced cells in OmM Ca“ buffered saline, initial fluorescence (Fo) was 1.00 +-0.00
(n—9 trials). Values of AF/ Fo increased to 1.42 +- SE= 0.06 (n-9 trials) following
perfusion with the 2mM buffered saline solution (fig. 4). This increase in fluorescence
indicates an increase in internal [Ca. We can infer that this increase in internal [Ca?
is due to Ca“ influx through TRPM7 because un-induced control cells did not show a
similar increase. For control cells, in OmM Ca“ buffered saline, initial fluorescence (Fo)
was 1.00 +- 0.01 (n=12 trials). Values of AF/ Fo did not change 1.01 +-0.01 (n=12
trials) following perfusion with OmM Ca“ buffered saline (fig. 4).
Response to the Addition of Mg
For TET induced TRPM7 overexpressing cells in 2mM Ca2/OmM Mg buffered
saline, fluorescence values of AF/ Fo increased .03 units (n=10 cells) following perfusion
with the 2mM Ca“7.002mM Mg“ buffered saline solution. The same cells showed a
decrease in AF/ Fo of.15 units (n=10 cells) following perfusion with 2mM Ca/02mM
Mg buffered saline, .17 units (n=10 cells) following perfusion with 2mM Ca2/.2mM
Mg“ buffered saline and .28 units following perfusion with 2mM Ca?/2mM Mg
buffered saline solution (fig. 5a). This decrease in fluorescence indicates a decrease in
internal [Ca“]. We can infer that the decrease in internal [Ca* is due to Ca* efflux
through TRPM7 because the uninduced control cells showed a much smaller decreased in
