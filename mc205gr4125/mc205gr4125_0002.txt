common in many mammalian cells including those found in the lymph nodes, thymus,
bone marrow, and brain (Wolf 2004). TRPM7 knockouts die unless given supplemental
magnesium, indicating that the ion channel is essential for normal cell functions (Schmitz
et al. 2003). Overexpression of the ion channel can also cause cell death possibly due to
apoptosis triggered by the influx of Ca through TRPM7 (Nadler 2001).
TRPM7 may be involved in Ca“, Mg“, and trace metal homeostasis. TRPM7 is
regulated by intracellular Mg- and Mg“-ATP, and the ion channel conducts several
essential and non-essential trace metals, including Zn2, Ni2, Ba2, Co*, Mn2, Sr2, and
Cd“ (Monteilh-Zoller et al. 2003). Imaging studies using the indicator dye fura 2/AM
have suggested that TRPM7 provides a pathway for Ca“ entry into the cell (Monteilh-
Zoller et al. 2003). Patch clamp and imaging studies have demonstrated Mn* influx in
TRPM7 expressing cells in the presence of Ca and Mg“, suggesting that Mn2
competes with Ca“ and Mg- for entry through TRPM7 (Thompson and Hermosura,
unpublished).
Homeostatic regulation of Ca“, Mg-, and trace metals is required for normal cell
function. Mg¬ is a cofactor for many enzymes involved in cellular metabolism. Mg¬
deficiency has been implicated in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and a variety of
cardiovascular and neurological problems, including stroke and hemorrhage (e.g. Altura
et al. 1998; Amighi et al. 2004; Van den Bergh et al. 2003). Some trace metals also serve
as cofactors for enzymes, but abnormal levels of trace metals have been correlated with
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease and related syndromes. Aluminum accumulation in
the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease has been assumed to play a role
in the etiology of the disease, although this assumption has recently been called into
