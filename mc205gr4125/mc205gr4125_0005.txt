eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 0.1% penicillin, 0.1%
streptomycin, 5ug/ml blastocidin, and 0.4 mg/ml zeocin. Cells were kept in a 30° C
incubator with 5% CO2 and passaged every 2-4 days when barely confluent.
Äfter each passage, cells were plated onto glass cover slips that had been coated
with high molecular weight poly-lysine and rinsed with nanopure water to increase cell
adhesion. 24-48 hours after plating, half the cells were induced with lug/ml tetracycline
(TET) so that they would begin to up-regulate expression of TRPM7. Sister cells from
the same plating were left uninduced as controls. Control and TET induced cells
received the same treatment in every other respect. TET induced and control cells show
morphological differences that aided in differentiating between the two groups (fig. 1).
Solutions
Cells on the glass coverslips were transferred from the tissue culture medium to a
buffered saline solution of the following composition (mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10
Hepes-NaÖH, 2 CaClz. Experimental solutions containing different concentrations of
Ca“ and Mg“ were made using the concentrations listed in table 1. Solutions containing
0.2, 0.02, and 0.002 mM Mg“ were made from a OmM Ca“, OmM Mg stock solution
containing 2mM metal chelator, EGTA (table 1). The amount of MgClz added to the
stock solution was adjusted to account for EGTA binding to free Mg“. Calculations
were made using MaxChelator (Patton et al. 2004). All solutions were titrated with IN or
O.IN NaÖH to bring the pH to 7.2. Glucose (approximately.02g/5Oml) was added to all
solutions a few hours before use.
