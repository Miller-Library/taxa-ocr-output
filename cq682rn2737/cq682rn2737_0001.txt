Acknowledgments
I thank my first reader, Dr. Lynna Hereford, for her patient guidance throughout the
course of both the research and writing stages of this thesis. Your excitement about this
project -- and your sense of humor! - have been invaluable.
Many thanks to Dr. Carol Boggs, my second reader and my academic advisor, for her
comments upon several drafts of this thesis and for offering her expertise in the
population genetics field.
I am also indebted to Dr. Dennis Hedgecock of UC Davis for providing the allozyme data
from his 1979 study and for offering tools and insight to aid in the data analysis. Drs.
Jeffrey Mitton and Patrick Gaffney were also influential in the data analysis.
Many thanks to Dr. Dennis Powers and his laboratory for providing resources and work
space and thanks to many others at the Hopkins Marine Station who assisted me in my
time there.
I would like to thank Gregory Morris for his contributions as my partner during the spring
course at the Hopkins Marine Station. The present work is an extension and completion
of our spring research.
I have also appreciated the guidance, reassurance, and administrative help of those in the
Human Biology office: Heidi Ballard, Jody Kamrowski, and Dr. Ellen Porzig.
Finally, I thank my family, friends, and future husband for their love and support.
