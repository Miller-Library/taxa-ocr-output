Cove (population 6) and 46 samples were from the coastline around Fort Ross (population
7).
Population 8 came from commercial divers who collected their abalone from the
south side of San Miguel Island off the coast of Santa Barbara in May 1992 (Westlotorn,
personal communication). Data from a 1979 Sea Grant study was used as a historical
comparison. Dennis Hedgecock (1979) analyzed samples of natural red abalone
populations collected from six sites in the Santa Barbara area, including the north and south
sides of San Miguel Island, and found very little variation from one collection site to the
next. Hedgecock's data were pooled to form Population 9 (N = 208) which represents the
natural abalone population off the coast of Santa Barbara. The cultivated abalone
populations in the study and in the other farms in California were ultimately derived from
the abalone in the Santa Barbara area (McBride, Oakes, McMullen, and McCormick,
personal communication).
Sample Preparation
Foot muscle, shell muscle, mantle, and/or gill tissue were analyzed (Table 2).
Tissue samples were placed in 1.5 mL Eppendorff tubes, with 20-40 microliters of buffer
and 5-10 mg of silicon beads. A buffer solution of O.1 MTris-HCl pH 7.0 buffer
containing O.1% B-mercaptoethanol was used for better resolution (Gaffney et al., 1992).
Samples were homogenized with an electric drill fitted with a glass grinding tip. To
prevent any denaturing of the proteins, samples were stored at -70 degrees C and placed on
ice during preparation and transport.
Horizontal Starch Gel Electrophoresis
The horizontal starch gel electrophoretic procedure was based on that described by
Schaal and Anderson (1974). No enzymatic activity was detected for isocitrate
dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate
