population. Perhaps what is most interesting to note is that by purchasing several different
spawns of seed stock and brood stock from a variety of abalone hatcheries, PMI managed
to inadvertently lessen any inbreeding that might have been present in any one hatchery-
produced spawn. The female broodstock, which has been formed from a number of
spawns from a variety of hatcheries, had a high estimated effective population size. The
male abalone sampled, probably resulting from as few as one or two spawns, had a very
low estimated effective population size. Figure 4 presents the origins of these two
populations.
The fairly low variance in allelic frequency found between the progenitor population
and the female abalone and the fairly high variance of the male abalone are contrasted with
the moderate shift in the three spawn populations. Though the three spawns were not
produced from the males sampled, this could indicate that the males that were spawned
have experienced a more intense population bottleneck than the female broodstock.
However, Figure 4 demonstrates that the males used in the 1991 spawns were made up of
abalone produced in a large number of hatchery spawns, just like the female broodstock. If
these males had an effective population size comparable to that of the female broodstock,
then the lower effective population sizes of the three spawns could indicate that an amount
of genetic diversity has been lost with each subsequent generation. This effect could most
likely be counteracted by mixing spawns together. Additionally, the discrepancy between
Nb and Nk in PMI spawn 1 could indicate that not all of the abalone used for each hatchery
spawn have contributed to the production of offspring. Overall, it appears as if little
inbreeding can be detected in these culture populations after analyzing both the present
genetic variation and the genetic drift.
