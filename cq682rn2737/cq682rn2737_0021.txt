swamping the system with miniseed (very small, inexpensive abalone) may be an
economically feasible method of enhancement (Tegner and Butler, 1989).
The most complete study of red abalone seeding was conducted on the Palos
Verdes peninsula (Tegner and Butler, 1985). A total of 674 red abalone of two different
sizes and originating from two different hatcheries were planted in the study site in May
1981. One year later, only 1% of the live seed was recovered. Seed mortality was
estimated at 43% based upon the shells collected. Although over one half of the population
was not accounted for, the 1% live recovery rate did not give much encouragement to the
feasibility of future abalone enhancement. However, some evidence indicates that this
study site, while accessible to the researchers, did not provide the best habitat for abalone
and was already too damaged by human development. At the time of the planting, no
emergent (visible to divers without turning over rocks) abalone were found in 700 m2.
The average density of the other, cryptic (hidden) red abalone was very low. Density (1
S.E.) was 0.17 + 0.12 per square meter for 70 m2 area sampled.
This was not the only test site used to examine the feasibility of red abalone
enhancement. In the spring of 1979, several sites on the Channel Islands were examined to
select a suitable site for planting seed (DeFelice, 1979). Tyler Bight, on the south coast of
San Miguel Island, was selected as the planting site as it offered "excellent food supply
physical habitats, and workable depths." (Butler, June 6-11 1979). The June 1979 survey
of the habitat found both emergent and cryptic abalone. Additionally, the density of red
abalone was calculated in three different areas where 46, 70, and 90 m2 samples were
performed (Butler, June 19-25 1979). The density values were 1.09,0.70, and 1.00
abalone per m2, which is nearly a factor of ten greater than the abalone density in the Palos
Verdes sample (Table 6). This indicates that San Miguel Island offered a much better
habitat for red abalone than the mainland test site. In August 1979, 20,000 red abalone
seed were planted in two sites at Tyler Bight (Butler, August 1-8 & 16-22 1979).
However, bad ocean conditions prevented the survival rate from being determined. In
