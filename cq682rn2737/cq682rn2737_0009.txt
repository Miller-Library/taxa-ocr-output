response to the diminishing natural supply of abalone was artificial enhancement. Though
testing by the California Department of Fish and Game officially labeled abalone seeding as
unsuccessful, the present study provides some evidence to the contrary. A re-analysis of
the California abalone enhancement projects is presented.
Materials & Methods
Sample Collection:
Please refer to Figure 2 for a map of the collection sites and to Table 1 for a
summary of the populations.
A total of five populations of cultured red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, were
collected from Pacific Mariculture, Incorporated (PMI) in Santa Cruz, California.
Population 1 (N = 156), Population 2 (N = 120), and Population 3 (N = 122) were
samples from three separate 1991 spawns that occurred on March 28, August 21, and July
25, respectively. For each spawning, PMI used between 25-50 gravid abalone. The
females were chosen from a brood stock of 7-800 individuals while the males were chosen
randomly from the production tanks. Population 4 (N = 43) was from the female
broodstock and includes samples from 12, 5 and 6 tagged individuals that were known to
have contributed eggs to spawns 1, 2 and 3, respectively. As PMI has no separate male
broodstock, 2.5 inch (about 2.5 year old) male abalone from one production tank were
sampled for Population 5 (N = 39). Based on size and growth rate estimations, most of the
male abalone used in 1991 spawns had probably been sold before samples were collected
for analysis. However, this population does offer an interesting comparison of allelic
diversity. Further examination of the genetic history of the male and female abalone used
in PMI's spawns will be explored in the Discussion.
In addition to the culture populations, two abalone populations from northern
California and two from southern California were studied. Seventy mantle and gill tissue
samples were collected from abalone harvested by recreational skin divers near Gerstle
