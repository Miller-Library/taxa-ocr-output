Abstract
The decline of natural stocks of the commercially harvested red abalone, Haliotis
rufescens, has led to land-based cultivation. To date, there has been little research on the
effects of domestication upon the genetic diversity of this species. In this study, protein
gel electrophoresis was used to estimate the extent of inbreeding and/or genetic drift
within cultured and natural red abalone populations. The present analysis of nine
populations indicates that there are significant differences between the genetic
compositions of the Santa Barbara 1992 population, believed to be an introduced
population, and the natural populations, but only slight differences between the cultured
and natural populations. This has implications for the success of the California abalone
enhancement programs of 1979-1980. Additional results of this study have relevance for
abalone aquaculture. The genetic drift analysis of one of the cultured populations
indicates that not all of the abalone used for each hatchery spawn had actually contributed
to the production of offspring.
