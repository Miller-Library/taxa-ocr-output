discussed previously, decreases in heterozygosity may not be the only indication of
significant changes in genetic composition resulting from reproductive isolation or small
population size. In measurements of heterozygosity, an increase in the evenness of
frequencies of the remaining alleles can compensate for the loss of rare alleles in a
population bottleneck. Since population bottlenecks often affect overall allelic diversity
more than they affect heterozygosity, it makes sense to analyze the shifts in allele frequency
between progenitor and derived populations. In a study comparing hatchery and natural
oyster populations and in a re-analysis of the data from several previously published
electrophoretic studies (Hedgecock et al., 1992), it has been shown "that superficial
similarities in levels of genetic diversity scan belie significant genetic changes in cultivated
stocks." (Hedgecock and Sly, 1990)
This is obviously the case with the 1992 Santa Barbara population, for although it
exhibited an increase in heterozygosity, the genetic drift analysis indicates that this
population most likely results from fewer than 22 parents. This is the strongest indication
that these abalone were indeed the product of an enhancement program. First, the abalone
hatcheries that produced abalone seed for the various abalone enhancement programs have
been known to use as few as 2-4 highly fecund abalone to produce thousands of stock
(Oakes, McMullen, McCormick, personal communication). Secondly, no other allozyme
study of native Haliotis rufescens populations has ever indicated any type of localized
genetic variation from one cove to the next. This present study shows very little genetic
differentiation between the 1979 southern and 1992 northern California abalone
populations, Hedgecock's 1979 data showed very little genetic differentiation between
abalone populations on various Channel Islands, and a third study showed very little
variation in abalone populations that were sampled from all along the California coast
(McKean, 1980).
As for the cultured abalone at PMI, the conclusions from the genetic drift analysis
are not nearly as dramatic for these populations as they are for the Santa Barbara
