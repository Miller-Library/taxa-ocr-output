Enhancement
In a striking example of how quickly genetic diversity can be altered, the genetic
drift analysis shows dramatic changes in the allele frequencies of the 1979 and 1992
abalone populations from near San Miguel Island. This change is thought to be the result
of human intervention. The present data show that for such a large change to occur in such
a short time frame, then this population would have to be the result of fewer than 22
spawning adults. As explained previously, no other allozyme study of natural red abalone
populations has ever found any information to indicate that any genetic differentiation exists
between natural abalone populations, so it seems more plausible to assume that these could
be hatchery produced abalone that were introduced to the area several years ago. Between
the late 1970's and the early 1980's, a variety of groups, including the California Divers
Association, the California Department of Fish and Game, Atlantic Richfield Company,
and recreational divers groups, sponsored abalone enhancement programs which resulted
in hundreds of thousands of hatchery-produced abalone being seeded in southern
California water from Palos Verdes to many of the Channel Islands, including San Miguel.
It seems as if a controversy was inadvertently unearthed during the course of this
present study. The California Department of Fish and Game determined that enhancement
was not successful and therefore not to be relied upon as a way to protect this valuable
natural resource, but the professional abalone divers disagree. Many feel that the
Department of Fish and Game studies were merely inconclusive - due to some poor site
choices for abalone enhancement and to the great difficulties involved in being able to track
and find abalone in natural environments months and years after introducing them. The
divers experience with abalone has led them to believe that small and mid-sized abalone
tend to hide in rock crevices and only reappear to be easily observed when they have grown
much larger. Despite relating very low live seed recovery (Â£2.8%) for five large-scale
seeding experiments with red and green abalones, one Fish and Game study allows that
