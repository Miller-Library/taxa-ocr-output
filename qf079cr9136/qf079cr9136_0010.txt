Point Alones chitons migrate to Mussel Point kelp bed and spread more
P. squarrosum? Observations demonstrated that chitons do travel and
further underwater tracking would be interesting.
The association between Cryptochiton stelleri and Pleonosporium
squarrosum is clearly evident. P. squarrosum prefers C. stelleri as a
source of space and refuge. However, new questions and research
possibilities increase with each Cryptochiton back found covered with
Pleonosporium squarrosum.
SUMMARY
1. Pleonosporium squarrosum varies in distribution and density with
geographical location of Cryptochiton stelleri population: P. squarrosum
is absent on intertidal Cryptochitons from Pescadero Point and Sti
water Cove and on shallow subtidal (10 ft) Cryptochitons; P. squarrosum
occurs on 928 of the Point Alones Cryptochitons with a mean of 60%
cover on individual chitons; P. squarrosum is present on the whole on
51% of Mussel Point Cryptochitons with a mean individual percent
cover of 13
On Cryptochiton dorsal surfaces, P. sauarrosum tends to be centrally
located.
3. P. squarrosum spores germinate on many non-chiton substrates, but
transplanting cut portions is not successful.
1. P. squarrosum dies at elevated temperatures of 21Â°C and above.
P. squarrosum seems best adapted for growth at underwater light levels
P. squarrosum can not tolerate exposure to air and its drying effects.
Tegula brunnea are found crawling on Cryptochiton backs, will eat
P. squarrosum, and may be a limiting factor in the alga's distribution.
6.
Cryptochiton stelleri is a probable dispersal agent for Pleonosporium
squarrosum.
