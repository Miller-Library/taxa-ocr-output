germinated on plastic, clamshell, worm tube, felt, glass and brick (fig. 7),
but no germinated spores were observed on sandpaper, living Loxorhynchus
carapaces, hydroid or red algae. Unfortunately, multiple attempts to
germinate spores on living Cryptochiton backs were unsuccessful. The
greatest amount of germination occurred when the polysporangial frond was
placed on the substrate and allowed to drop spores directly on the desired
substrate, rather than dropping the spores in a separate petri dish to be
pipetted up and then distributed.
A second experiment was conducted to check growth of Pleonosporium
squarrosum on non-chiton substrates. P. squarrosum, when cut, develops
rhizoids at the severed end (fig. 8). Transplants of these tiny cuttings
were attempted on a variety of possible substrates, including glass, plastic,
worm tube, hydroid fronds, red algae, brick and felt. The rhizoids were
observed entangled on the hydroid and worm tube, but the thalli turned
pink and died. Fronds were observed to only briefly stick to plastic and
glass, and no attachment was successful with red algae, brick or felt.
Plants transplanted onto bare-backed Cryptochitons did not die, but never
became firmly attached.
Temperature levels fluctuate from warm in tidepools to cold in
subtidal areas. Does temperature influence Pleonosporium squarrosum
distribution? Fronds were cut, put in sterile vials and held in temperature
baths to determine the effects of elevated temperature on P. squarrosum.
The alga had been maintained in the laboratory at 18.5째0, so 20째C was
chosen as a starting point with additional temperatures of 21째, 21째, and
25 C. Samples were placed in the baths at set times so that a continuum
from 1-6 h was achieved (fig. 9). The fronds turned bright pink (leakage
of photosynthetic pigments) or showed plasmolysis. There was no significant
