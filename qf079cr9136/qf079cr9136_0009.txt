chitons intertidally and shallow subtidally (10 ft) is the existence of
herbivorous gastropods, specifically Tegula brunnea, that crawl over
chiton backs. In the laboratory they appear to be potential devastators
of epizoic P. squarrosum. The fecal matter filled with bristles alone
indicates that they do rasp Cryptochiton backs. Field studies would be
necessary to truly test the herbivory effects on C. stelleri with P.
squarrosum.
Since Pleonosporium squarrosum seems so selective for subtidal
living in Monterey, and since it does germinate on non-chiton substrates
in the laboratory, why is P. squarrosum no found subtidally without its
Cryptochiton? Perhaps the spores have little or no chance to drift
around and onto other substrates before germination (2-1 days after release).
Possibly P. squarrosum not on chitons is more easily grazed off. Maybe
the tiny alga loses in the competition for space, as on rock faces. On
Cryptochiton backs another species of algae for instance, Rhodoptilum
plumosum (Harvey) Kylin, may dominate and crowd out the P. squarrosum.
Decorator crabs, Diopatra worms and hydroids may be selective in what they
allow to grow on their backs, tubes or fronds, and perhaps P. squarrosum
rarely is given a start. More experiments should be done to follow the
laboratory spores that germinated—how long do they live? do they flourish?
or do they stagnate like the transplanted growing tips?
An important question remains—why the great discrepancy in amount
of Pleonosporium squarrosum on Cryptochitons inttwo kelp beds separated
by only a sand channel? Mussel Point and Point Alones kelp beds are
different. The Point Alones kelp bed has less exposure to swells, has
calmer water, is generally deeper, has a more sandy bottom, has higher
salinity and a lower Cryptochiton density. Later in the season will
