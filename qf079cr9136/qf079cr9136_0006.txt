change observed in the plants held at 20° and 21°0, nor in the control
held at 120. However after 2 h at 21°C 10% plant damage was noted, and
similarly at 25°0 plant damage rose after 2 h until 90% death was reported
after 6 h of exposure.
Light levels vary between tidepools, shallow subtidal and deep
subtidal areas. Is Pleonosporium squarrosum distribution and growth
affected by light? Growing tips were cut and placed in sterile vials in
the dark (O lux), under illumination equal to that at a depth of 25 ft
(86 lux), and under high illumination (1668 lux). The total length of the
fronds (thallus plus rhizoids) was measured and the total gain in length
was plotted against time (fig. 10). Most impressive was the difference
between increase in length of plants in low subtidal-like illumination
and those at a high intensity light level. The low illuminated fronds
grew over three times as much as the highly illuminated fronds. Much of
the growth of the plants in the dark was rhizoidal.
Intertidal Cryptochiton stelleri are often exposed to the air
during the tidal cycle. Is Pleonosporium squarrosum tolerant of exposure
to air? Fresh tips were cut and kept in 12°0 sea water. At set times the
tips were exposed to air by placing the fronds on dry plastic or damp
filter paper. A range of air exposure time was obtained-from 5 to 360 min
(fig. 11). The control which remained underwater showed no change. On
the plastic, partial plant damage was evident after only 15 min and the
amount of damage climbed rapidly to 100%. The fronds on the damp filter
paper showed damage after 30 min and seemed more resistant to death by
drying.
A final test investigated the influence of herbivory on Pleonosporium
squarrosum. Herbivorous snails are commonly seen on intertidal and shallow
