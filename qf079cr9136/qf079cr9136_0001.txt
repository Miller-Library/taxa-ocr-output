INTRODUCTION
The giant chiton, Cryptochiton stelleri (Middendorff, 1846) is
known from northern Japan to southern California for its thick brick-
red girdle covered by tufts of crimson calcareous bristles (Smith, 1975).
Close examination of this mollusk often reveals that Cryptochiton's
dorsal surface also maintains a minature forest of red algae. Pleonosporium
squarrosum Kylin (Ceramiaceae), the 2-3 cm tall red alga is a leading
member of the chiton's epizoic community. The distribution of P. squarrosum
is limited to pilings of docks at Friday Harbor, Washington (Kylin, 1925)
and the backs of a few subtidal invertebrates in Monterey, California
(Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976). P. squarrosum appears very selective in
its habitat, yet common on the Cryptochiton despite an earlier report by
MacGintie and MacGintie (1968) which indicated that Cryptochiton backs did
not carry a distinctive flora or fauna. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the obvious chiton-alga association-its incidence, distribution.
causality and natural history.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Work on this interrelationship was carried out between April and
June 1980. The Cryptochiton stelleri populations at several locations were
sampled: in the kelp bed off Mussel Point, Monterey Bay at a depth of
25-30 ft; in the Point Alones kelp bed east of Mussel Point at a 25 ft depth:
from the tidepools at Pescadero Point at a -0.9 tide level; and from the
intertidal zone on a -1.h tide at Stillwater Cove, Carmel Bay. These
sites were chosen because they represent varying conditions of exposure to
waves and of water depth.
Cryptochiton stelleri population density was estimated by swimming
