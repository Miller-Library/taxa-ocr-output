DISCUSSION
The distribution of Pleonosporium squarrosum is still an enigma,
but plausible explanations can be derived. P. squarrosum's intertidal
appearance at Friday Harbor and strictly subtidal existence in Monterey
Bay may be due to temperature zonation. Much marine life from high
latitudes is found deeper as the equator is approached (Cullinery, 1976).
In experiments, P. squarrosum survived at such temperatures as 20°C and
21°0, but only long term experimentation would determine whether the
alga actually thrives and completes its life cycle at elevated temperatures.
P. squarrosum has never been reported in areas of warm water (Abbott and
Hollenberg, 1976), nor is its distribution as wide as that of its host.
A careful search for a northern Cryptochiton-Pleonosporium association
should be undertaken since Cryptochiton are abundant intertidally along
the Oregon coast (Palmer and Frank, 1974), at Friday Harbor and northward,
and may again support a P. squarrosum population.
On the Monterey Peninsula, why aren't all Cryptochiton stelleri
carriers of Pleonosporium squarrosum? Tidepool water may get too warm.
In addition, light intensity differs by magnitudes between 25 ft under
a kelp canopy and in the direct sunlight at low tide. Experimental results
did show a difference in growth rate of vegetative axes at different light
levels. In stress conditions of high light intensity the phycobilins, the
major photosynthetic pigments in red algae, are bleached out and photosyn¬
thetic rate and plant growth would diminsh(fStrain, 1951). Air exposure
and desiccation is probably a major factor limiting the Cryptochiton-
Pleonosporium association. The delicate alga showed no tolerance for
drying out in the laboratory and a chiton back, although damp, would be
unsatisfactory at low tide. Another possible reason for bare-backed
