or walking quadrats 5 me and the number of Cryptochitons with Pleonosporium
squarrosum was noted. Random specimens were collected, tagged, weighed
and measured. Percent cover by P. squarrosum was analyzed by generating
50 random polar coordinate points marked on a transparent sheet of plastic
that was pinned to the center of each chitonts back. The presence or
absence of P. squarrosum was recorded under these 50 points. Other epizoic
life was also noted. While in the field collecting chitons, a search was
conducted for P. squarrosum not on Cryptochiton.
In the laboratory, samples of Pleonosporium squarrosum were picked
off the backs of Cryptochitons. Counts were made of female, male, poly-
sporangia-bearing and sterile plants. Some vegetative axes were cut for
culture and experimentation. Others were chosen to drop spores for spore
germination tests. All the cultures were grown in disposable plastic petri
dishes with filtered (.22/m) sea water, a nutrient sea water mixture and
germanium dioxide to retard diatom growth. Substrate, temperature and
light varied with the experiment.

Weight, Size and Distribution
The 39 collected chitons ranged in length from 15-28 cm with wet
weights between 260 g and 1330 g. These individuals were similar in size
and age to others previously studied (MacGintie and MacGintie, 1968).
Most obvious was that some Cryptochiton stelleri were algae-covered and
some were bare-backed (fig. 1). Pleonosporium squarrosum was absent on the
backs of the Cryptochiton st Pescadero Point and at Stillwater Cove.
However, the populations of Cryptochiton from Mussel Point and Point Alones
kelp beds had P. squarrosum in varying amounts.
