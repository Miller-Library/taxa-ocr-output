colonies of hydroids, tubes of the worm Diopatra ornata (Moore, 1911)
found in the subtidal Cryptochiton habitat, clam and abalone shells, subtidal
rock faces, subtidal algae, and even the sandy sea bottom on which Crypto-
chiton crawl. Although Abbott and Hollenberg (1976) report P. squarrosum
on decorator crabs and hydroids, no new specimens were observed on these
substrates. Neither was P. squarrosum found on the other non-chiton
substances. There were certainly a variety of other small algae, but no
P. squarrosum.
Pleonosporium squarrosum Population Structure
To estimate population structure of Pleonosporium squarrosum, a
random sample of 167 plants were picked. Counts indicated 68% sterile
plants, 11% polysporangia-bearing plants (fig. 1), 11% male plants with
spermatangia (fig. 5), and 8% female plants with procarps (fig. 6).
Since the distribution of Pleonosporium squarrosum was found to
vary among the Cryptochiton populations (none on intertidal chitons and
different amounts on subtidal chitons), laboratory experiments were set up
to test hypotheses about the reasons for P. squarrosum specificity and
selectivity. Is it the substrate itself, the temperature, the light level.
the air exposure or another epizoic creature that determines P. squarrosum
incidence and growth?
Experimental
Spores from polysporangia were presented with various substrates in
the first experiment on germination preferences. Spores successfully
