Percent Cover of Pleonosporium squarrosum
The two populations from Mussel Point and Point Alones kelp beds not
only showed a difference in percent of Pleonosporium-covered Cryptochitons,
but also a difference in percent cover by P. squarrosum on the individual
chitons (fig. 2). The eleven sampled Mussel Point Cryptochitons had
percent cover ranging from 26% to 0% with a mean of 138; whereas, the 13
Point Alones chitons had Pleonosporium cover ranging from 918 to 0% with
a mean of 60%.
Of the chitons that did show Pleonosporium squarrosum algal cover,
the presence of the alga seemed most common within a circle of radius
6.5 cm centered at the center point of the chiton back. Sixteen of the 18
collected Cryptochiton with P. squarrosum demonstrated this centralized
concentration of algae. The alga also was prevalent on the dorsal humps
made by the underlying plates.
Other Epizoic Life
During the search for Pleonosporium squarrosum on Cryptochiton
stelleri, much other epizoic algae was discovered. Included was: Lyngbya
sp., Bryopsis sp., Cladophorasp., Enteromorpha linza (Linnaeus) J. Agardh,
Ulothrix sp., Giffordia sandriana (Zanardini) Hamel, Sphacelaria sp.,
Goniotrichum sp., Heterosiphonia japonica Yendo, Platythamnion sp.,
Polyneura latissima (Harvey) Kylin, Polysiphonia pacifica Hollenberg,
Pterosiphonia dendroidea (Montagne) Falkenberg, Rhodoptilum plumosum (Harvey
& Bailey) Kylin, and colonial diatoms. Epizoic organisms included gastropods
(Tegula brunnea and Ocenebra spp.), nematodes, tiny hermit crabs and
occasionally, amphipods and copepods.
