subtidal (10 ft) Cryptochiton stelleri. Could the grazing behavior of
these gastropods account for the paucity of P. squarrosum at these tidal
levels? Two chitons with known P. squarrosum percent cover were placed
in an aquarium with 12 Tegula brunnea (Philipp, 1848). The snails crawled
all over the chitons and seemed to be eating. After 19 days the chitons
seemed barer and the remaining P. squarrosum wasstraggly. Fecal matter
of the Tegula brunnea was also collected and observed to be brown and
riddled with red chiton bristles. In another test, fronds of the alga
were put in containers, each containing one T. brunnea. This experiment
was repeated three times and each time one quarter of the fronds would
disappear or look nibbled. All the T. brunnea were fed Macrocystis pyrifera
(Linnaeus) C. Agardh for 3 days previous to testing so that the results
of this herbivory testing would not be artifacts of snail starvation and
thus indiscriminate eating.
Since Pleonosporium squarrosum did not seem to grow efficiently as
a transplant and the spores are non-motile, germinating best directly
under the polysporangial fronds, how is P. squarrosum spread throughout a
Cryptochiton population? Chitons are sometimes found in twos or threes.
but do they move enough to act as a dispersal agent for P. squarrosum?
On May 20, two tagged chitons were released at a 10 ft depth in the Mussel
Point kelp bed and two at a 25 ft depth. Two days later these released
chitons were relocated and the distance from their starting point was
measured. At 10 ft, one chiton had moved 2.l m and the other, O.3 m.
At 25 ft, one had moved 0.6 m and its companion, 1.0 m. Cryptochiton
movement is great enough to be measurable, although in a previous study off
the Oregon coast, the Cryptochitons moved only 20 m from the point of
release in two years (Palmer and Frank, 1974).
