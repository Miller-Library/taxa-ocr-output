Photosynthetic Rhythms in I. flaccida

Introduction
Though circadian rhythms in algae have been described,
only a few algal species have been examined. The green
alga Acetabularia (Terborgh, 1967), the dinoflagellate
Gonyaulax polyedra (Hastings et al., 1961), and the diatom
Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Livingston, 1964) all have
circadian photosynthetic rhythms. These rhythms have
been well documented and many interesting techniques for
their measurement were used. For example, Prezelin and
Sweeney (1977) described diurnal periodicity in the photo¬
synthetic capacity of G. polyedra in terms of variations
in the initial slopes of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I)
curves. The absence of changes in either pigment concen¬
trations or in cell numbers throughout the time-course of
the rhythmic changes in photosynthesis indicated a photo¬
synthetic rhythm.
Despite the documentation of such rhythms in some
algae, there has been no investigation to date of circadian
photosynthetic rhythms in red algae, although the effects
of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and
exposure to air have been studied (Kanwisher, 1966; Hodgson,
in prep; Johnson et al., 1974). Johnson and his coworkers
reported that Iridaea flaccida has a higher photosynthetic
rate in air than in water, and that the photosynthetic rate
increases after some degree of desiccation. However, the
potential effects of endogenous circadian rhythmicity in
