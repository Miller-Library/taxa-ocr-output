in the light-limiting irradiances would proceed at a rate
independent of circadian times.
These P-I curves also give some indication as to
whether photosynthetic rates in air are comparable to
those in water. A conversion from mg Co/g dry wt./h to
ul O/g dry wt./h was calculated so that direct comparisons
could be made. Photosynthetic rates in air are only
slightly less than those in water. This is in direct
contrast to the findings by Johnson et al. (1974), who
found photosynthetic rates in air 2.94 times greater than
photosynthetic rates in water for I. flaccida.
The effects of desiccation on photosynthetic rates
were measured for I. flaccida from the Middle zone. Results
indicate that a small amount of drying enhances net photoÂ¬
synthesis. This effect was prominent when the algal
samples were desiccated to approximately 80% of their
fully hydrated weights. Desiccation in excess of this
amount caused marked reductions in photosynthetic rates.
I. flaccida is exposed many hours each day and the increased
photosynthetic rates during exposure are of interest.
Extreme desiccation is not a problem for I. flaccida in
the Middle and Low zones because it retains sea water on
the underside of the thallus under natural conditions. The
High zone is exposed for longer periods, however, and
damage due to desiccation may be of greater significance
for algae in this zone. Further studies will be directed
toward measuring the relationship between photosynthetic
