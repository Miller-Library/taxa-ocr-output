incubated and maintained in dim constant light.
Alternate dark and light bands represent subÂ¬
jective night and day, respectively. Values
are the means of triplicate samples with vertical
bars representing standard errors. Samples
were collected from the A) Low, B) Middle, and
C) High intertidal zones.
Figure 2
Respiration of Iridaea flaccida from Low, Middle,
and High intertidal zones. Algal samples were
preincubated and maintained in dim constant light
but measurements were taken under total dark
conditions. Alternate light and dark bands
represent subjective day and night, respectively.
Values are the means of triplicate samples with
vertical bars representing standard errors.

Photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves for
Iridaea flaccida in water. Photosynthetic
measurements were made at distinct circadian
times beginning at ct O or subjective dawn (0600).
