by Umbreit et al. (1972). The sidearm of each Gilson
flask contained a standard bicarbonate buffer solution
to keep carbon dioxide levels at normal levels throughout
the duration of each experiment (Pratt, 1943). One gram
fresh weight samples were placed into 10 ml fresh sea water
and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min., a period found to
be necessary before a maximum photosynthetic rate was
achieved. Readings were taken every 15 min. for one hour.
Constant illumination of 195 pE/m/s was supplied by flood¬
lights in the respirometer. Experiments requiring a range
of irradiances used layers of neutral density screens over
individual Gilson flasks. The algal samples were sub¬
sequently dried to a constant weight in an 80°C drying
oven. Similar procedures were used for respiration meas¬
urements made in darkness except the sidearm contained
0.4 ml of 30% KOH to absorb carbon dioxide.
Photosynthesis in air was measured using a Beckman
Model 215 Infared Gas Analyzer. I. flaccida was kept
under the same preincubation conditions as described above.
Before placing 10.0 g fresh weight samples in the flow¬
through sample chamber, they were shaken ten times to re¬
move excess water. Carbon dioxide changes were recorded
on a Beckman stripchart recorder. The temperature inside
the flow-through chamber was kept at 15°C with refrigerated
water baths. The light source was an overhead 500 watt
tungsten-iodide lamp combined with neutral density screens
to achieve a range of irradiances from 17.5 to 1400 uE/m2/s.
After photosynthetic measurements, these algal samples
