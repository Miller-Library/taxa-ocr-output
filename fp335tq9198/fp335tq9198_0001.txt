Photosynthetic Rhythms in I. flaccida

Abstract
Endogenous circadian rhythms in photosynthesis are
described for the first time in the red alga Iridaea
flaccida (S. & G.)Silva. These rhythms persist under
constant conditions for three days showing a 36% difference
between maximum photosynthetic rates at midday and minimum
rates at night. Respiration is constant over the circadian
cycle. Changes in the initial slopes of photosynthesisÂ¬
irradiance curves at different circadian times suggest
the involvement of the light reactions in this rhythmicity.
Photosynthetic rates of I. flaccida are comparable in air
and in water when the thallus is fully hydrated. A small
amount of desiccation enhances the photosynthetic rates,
while continued desiccation results in a marked decrease.
