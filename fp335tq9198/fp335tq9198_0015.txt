Iridaea flaccida in air. Photosynthetic
measurements were made at distinct circadian
times beginning at ct O or subjective dawn
(0600 h). A factor of 509 was calculated
assuming a photosynthetic quotient of 1.0,
for conversion from mg Co/g dry wt./h to
ul O/g dry wt./h for direct comparisons of
in air and in water photosynthesis.

as measured by per cent wet weight, and photoÂ¬
synthesis for Iridaea flaccida.
