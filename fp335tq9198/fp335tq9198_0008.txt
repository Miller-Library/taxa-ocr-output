at different circadian times. Both in air and in water
values
photosynthetic measurements gave increased P,
at midday and decreased Pmay
values in the late afternoon
and evening. These changes in the values of Pyax in the
P-I studies are consistent with the endogenous photosynthetic
rhythmicity observed in the 72 h experiment.
The changes in the initial slopes of the P-I curves
suggest involvement of the light reactions in photosynthetic
rhythmicity as was found for the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax
polyedra (Prezelin and Sweeney, 1972 a, b). They hypothe¬
sized that the change they observed in initial P-I slopes is
due to some conformational change in the thylakoid membranes
with which the light reactions are associated. Steeper
initial slopes indicate more efficient photosynthetic
abilities at particular circadian times. The photosynthetic
measurements in air reported here clearly show this rela¬
tionship. The initial slopes of the P-I curves are pro¬
gressively steeper from ct O to ct 6, and then decrease
by ct 12. Thus, the photosynthetic efficiency is greater
at ct 6 than at other circadian times.
Photosynthetic
measurements in water yielded similar results. This dif¬
ference in initial slopes suggests that the mechanism
controlling the endogenous photosynthetic rhythm in Iridaea
flaccida resides in components of the photosynthetic light
reactions. Differences in initial slopes would not be
anticipated if the rhythm was due to some circadian change
in the dark reaction components since initial photosynthesis
