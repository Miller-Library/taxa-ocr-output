photosynthesis and respiration were not adequately considered
in that study. The studies presented here examine endogenous
rhythms in photosynthesis of Iridaea flaccida. In addition
desiccation as a consequence of periodic exposure during the
tidal cycle was studied to determine its effects on the
rates of photosynthesis.
Materials and Methods
Iridaea flaccida was collected from a relatively
protected location in Monterey Bay at Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove, California. Three vertical zones were designated as
High, +3 to +4 ft, Middle, +2 to +3 ft, and Low, +1 to +2 ft
above mean lower low water. The algae were collected at low
tide, then kept in clear plastic bins filled with fresh sea
water. These bins were placed in a constant temperature
room at 15°C, and maintained under dim constant light at
irradiances from 25 to 30 uE/m/s as provided by cool white
fluorescent lamps. The algae were incubated for at least
24 hours under these conditions before being used for ex¬
periments. Preliminary studies showed that different portions
of the thallus have different photosynthetic capabilities.
Only middle portions of the thallus were used, and I. flaccida
which had been grazed upon or which had reproductive struc¬
tures were avoided.
Photosynthesis and respiration of algae submerged in
sea water were measured with a Gilson constant pressure
differential respirometer. This procedure has been documented
