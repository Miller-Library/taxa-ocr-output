rhythm. These fluctuations in photosynthetic rate coincide
with the natural light-dark regime. There is clearly
anticipation of cyclic changes in irradiance throughout
the 24 h day as indicated by the persistence of these
rhythms in the absence of external cues. I. flaccida
from the Middle zone also exhibited an endogenous circadian
rhythm with a lesser degree of persistence. I. flaccida from
the High intertidal zone did not have a clear rhythm in the
preliminary 24 h experiment nor in the 72 h experiment. The
photosynthetic rates seemed to increase and decrease withÂ¬
out regard to either the natural light-dark regime or the
tidal cycle, although superimposition of the two would be
extremely difficult to interpret. The High zone is exposed
approximately 16 h/day as compared to an average 11.3 h/day
for the Middle, and 6.8 h/day for the Low. This longer
period of exposure may have some deleterious effects on
photosynthetic rates and may result in fluctuating Pmax
values. Further investigation of the effects of exposure
will be necessary before any firm conclusions can be drawn
about the photosynthetic fluctuations of I. flaccida in the
High intertidal.
Rates of respiration over a 24 h period indicated that
the respiration was relatively constant for all three zones.
Therefore, variations in respiratory rates cannot account
for the diurnal periodicity in photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis-irradiance experiments were conducted to
further elucidate aspects of the photosynthetic rhythm. These
experiments gave estimates for maximum photosynthesis (Pmax)
