from the data at distinct circadian times over a 24 h
period. See Figures 3 and 4. Photosynthetic rates at
light saturation (Pmax) were estimated by taking the mean
of the last five data points. Table 1 presents these
values determined at different circadian times (ct) where
ct O is local dawn (0600). Pmax values at ct 6 were conÂ¬
sistently higher than at other circadian times, corresponding
to the diurnal changes in Pmax reported in the 72 h study.
Initial slopes were determined by linear regression analyses
which assumed a zero intercept and utilized photosynthetic
values between O and 130 uE/m2/s. Table 1 gives values for
the initial slopes of these P-I curves with the corresponding
standard errors and correlation coefficients. The initial
slopes of the P-I curves, as calculated by least squares
linear regression (Sokal & Rohlf, 1969), were directly
proportional to the circadian time and the magnitude of
Pmax values.
A desiccation study revealed that photosynthetic rates
of I. flaccida increased during desiccation to 80% of its
fully hydrated weight. See Figure 5. After this degree
of desiccation was reached, the rates of photosynthesis
decreased precipitously.
Discussion
An endogenous photosynthetic rhythm in the red alga
Iridaea flaccida has been demonstrated. Samples from the
Low intertidal zone provided the clearest evidence of this
