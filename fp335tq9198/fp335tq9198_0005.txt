were dried to constant weight.
Different levels of desiccation were achieved by placing
samples on strips of aluminum foil and allowing them to
desiccate on the laboratory bench at 22°C. The extent
of desiccation is expressed as a ratio of the desiccated
weight to the initial fully hydrated weight, and reported
as per cent.
Results
A preliminary 24 h study of the photosynthetic rates
of Iridaea flaccida revealed a well-defined endogenous
circadian rhythm in algae collected from the Low and Middle
zones. I. flaccida from the High zone, however, did not
show this photosynthetic rhythmicity. A 72 h experiment
supported the early observation and indicated that this
rhythm persists with only slight damping. See Figures 1A,
1B, and 1C. A 36% difference in photosynthetic rates
between maximum values in the subjective day and minimum
values in the subjective night was measured during the
first 48 h for the Middle and Low zones. Maximum photo¬
synthesis was reached between 1100 and 1300 h, while
photosynthetic rates were lowest between 0200 and 0500 h.
The respiratory rate did not show an endogenous rhythm
nor great variability throughout the day. See Figure 2.
Photosynthetic rates in air and in water were measured
over a range of irradiances from 17.5 to 290 pE/m/s.
Photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves were constructed
