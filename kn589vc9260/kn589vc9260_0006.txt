C
similarity between the activity patterns of the blind and
the normal crabs. One would be that the crabs possess some
type of dermal light sense. Another possibility, which seems
more likely, is that the normal behavior of the blinded crabs
during the bright part of the day is changed by the behavior
of the other crabs in the pond with them. These possibilities
should be tested.
Summary
Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanus show a rhythmic
activity pattern in which most crabs are active at night while
the number active during the day is greatly reduced. This
pattern of dispersion appears to be an inverse response to
intensity of illumination. Pagurus samuelis consistently
becomes active earlier in the afternoon than does Pagurus
granosimanus.
