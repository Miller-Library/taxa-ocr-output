Introduction
Many Crustaceans show rhythmic activity patterns which
continue even under conditions of constant illumination.
(Brown, 1961) According to Pardi and Papi (1961) hermit
crabs of the genus Pagurus are positively phototropic at
low and medium light intensities, but negatively phototropic
at high intensities. It was observed that two local species
of hermit crabs, Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanus,
were out moving around on the bottom of a pond in much
larger numbers during the night than during the day. In.
order to determine whether the Pagurus were responding to
a physiological rhythm or directly to light the numbers of
animals out in the open on the bottom of a pond were compared
over 24 hour periods of constant light, constant darkness,
and normal day-night conditions.
Materials and Methods
The Pagurus used in the following experiments were all
collected at the Great Tidepool on Point Pinos near Pacific
Grove. A 15 X 9 foot pond was divided in half by plastic
screen Ã¥nchored by rocks to give two areas 7.5 x 9 feet.
The water in the pond was usually maintained at a depth of
7 inches, although several times it became deeper due to
plugged drains. A section of sheet rock with an area of
