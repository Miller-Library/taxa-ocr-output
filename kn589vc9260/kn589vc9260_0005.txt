sample (figure 6) fails to show the drop in dispersion during
the day which was found in all other cases.
Discussion
It appears that the activity pattern shown by the two
species of Pagurus is a direct response to illumination.
The lack of any rhythmic behavior cycle in the crabs kept in
the darkroom would tend to support this hypothesis. Assuming
that the activity pattern is a direct response to light, the
failure to break this pattern with constant illumination might
be attributed to insufficient light intensity. Such an explan-
ation seems quite plausible when it is noted that the maximum
intensity which could be produced was less than 3% of that of
sunlight. It is possible that temperature may be a factor in
the pattern of dispersion exhibited by the crabs, but the in-
verse correlation between number of crabs active and illumin-
ation is much better than that between number of crabs active
and temperature.
Position in the intertidal is possibly correlated to the
difference in the times at which activity begins to pick up
during the late afternoon in the two speoies. The P. samuelis
are normally found higher in the intertidal, (Belknap and
Markham, unpublished) and may thus have become adapted to
greater light intensities.
There are at least two possible explanations for the
