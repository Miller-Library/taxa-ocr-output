pond. Gooseneck lamps containing 100 watt bulbs were placed
at each of the corners and in the center on both sides of the
pond. Unfortunately, the illumination achieved was far from
uniform, since it varied from 14-230 ft.-candles at different
points in the pond. Also, as can be seen from figures 4 and 5,
the maximum illumination obtained at night was less than 37
of that obtained from the sun.
It was impractical to produce constant darkness in the
pond due to its size. Instead of this, 25 crabs of each species,
which had been blinded by cutting off their eyestalks, were
added to the pond. It was later decided that these crabs did
not provide a satisfactory dark sample, so an experiment was
set up in a darkroom with constant darkness, a constant tem-
perature of 14'C, and the same population density as the out-
door pond.
Results
Both species of Pagurus seemed to show a very definite
pattern of dispersion with large numbers of crabs active at
night and a much smaller number active during the day when
they were kept in the outdoor pond. (figures 1-5) In every
case P. samuelis became active before P. granosimanus during
the late afternoon.
The constantly illuminated sample shows a pattern of
dispersion which does not differ greatly from the other two
samples kept under normal day-night conditions." The darkroom
