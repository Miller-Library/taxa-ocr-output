1. The reason for the unusually high humber of P. gran-
ogipanus and the unusually low number of P. samuelis active
at the start of this eiperiment is unknown. The sharp drop
in the number of crabs active at 2300 may have resulted
from the investigator disturbing the pond while taking light
readings.
