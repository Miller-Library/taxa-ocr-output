slightly over 4 square feet was supported on rocks on each
side of the screen in order to provide the crabs with shade.
The shells of the two species of Pagurus were painted
different colors (P. samuelis yellow and P. granosimanus
orange), but the screen between the two species was necessary.
since without it there would have been considerable inter-
specifio shell exchange. In experiments where blinded crabs
were used their shells were painted red and they were placed
with the normal crabs of their own species. There may have
been some shell exchange between blind and normal crabs, but
this did not appear to be a major source of error over the 24
hours which the experiments ran. The crabs were recounted
and checked as to species and condition of eyes before each
experiment.
In some cases dispersion had to be determined somewhat
arbitrarily because the crabs would pile up in a corner rather
than seeking shelter. When the crabs packed up in tight masses
and ceased their activity they were not counted as dispersed.
It was impossible to maintain a constant temperature in the
pond, so the temperature and illumination were both taken over
the entire 24 hour period. In all counts made at night a ruby
bulb was used for observing the crabs.
Constant illumination was obtained by suspending a bank
of lights (with a total wattage of 900) 2.5 feet above the
pond's surface at a distance of 3.67 feet from each end of the
