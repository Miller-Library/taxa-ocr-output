Figure 3. Body ammonia concentration of D. moniloceras
as affected by length of time exposed to high ambient
ammonia concentration. Normal body concentration of
ammonia refers to ammonia concentration in the bodies
of worms kept in running sea water. Numbers next to
data points refer to ambient ammonia concentrations, in
ug/ml., at the end of the corresponding exposure times.
