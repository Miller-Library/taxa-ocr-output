Excretion in Polychaates
Whitmore and Blodgett 7
found to be approximately 500 times higher than that of
the ambient water. Tillinghast (1967) found that gut
ammonia concentration in Lumbricus was 10-50 times higher
than the coelom ammonia concentration. Possibly this
situation also exists in polychaetes, which could explain
now such a high internal concentration can be maintained.
Summary
1. In Dorvillea moniloceras and Halosydna brevisetosa
ammonia comprises more than 80% of the nitrogenous ex-
cretion product. In Nerinides acuta, ammonia comprises
only approximately 50% of the nitrogenous excretion pro-
duct.
2. Excretion rates in these polychaetes are variable
both within and among species, but generally tend to be
between 3 and 8 ug/ml. worm/hour.
3. In Dorvillea moniloceras ammonia excretion rate was
found to decrease as ambient ammonia concentration in-
creased, with some lessening of the effect with longer
periods of exposure to high ambient ammonia concentration.
4. In Dorvillea moniloceras, worms exposed to high ambient
ammonia concentrations and then placed in pure Instant
Ocean exereted ammonia at much higher than normal rates.
3. In Dorvillea moniloceras, it was found that the
worms' internal body ammonia concentrations increased
in high ambient ammonia concentrations and with longer
times of exposure to these concentrations.
