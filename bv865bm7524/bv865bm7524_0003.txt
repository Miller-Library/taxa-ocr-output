Excretion in Polychaetes
izing with 1 N HCl. A series of ammonium sulfate standards
was prepared with each set of analyses. Linearity of
the relationship between concentration and optical
density was observed between 0.75 and 3.0 ug ammonia.
All measurements were made with reference to an ammonia
free water blank or a reagent blank prepared with Instant
Ocean. Readings were taken on a Klett-Summerson photo-
electric colorimeter with a red filter.
rotal Nitrogen Determination. Total nitrogen was deter-
mined as ammonia by the method described above after
digestion in a mixture of 1 part 5% CuSO,, 6 parts 85%
HgPO,, 2 parts concentrated H,SO,, and 9 parts distilled
water. Only 0.2 ml. of the digestion mixture was required
per 1.0 ml. sample. Prior to the development of color,
the digest was neutralized to approximately pH 6-7 and
made up to 1 ml. with ammonia free water.
Body Concentration of Ammonia. Groups of 5 worms each
were homogenized with 15 volumes of water per volume of
worm. Then 2 volumes of sodium tungstate were added to
the homogenate in a 125 ml. erlenmeyer flask. 2 volumes
of 2/3 N H,SO, were added while swirling. The flask
was immediately stoppered and shaken for 30 seconds, fol-
lowed by filtration through paper.
Reproducibility between replicate ammonia determi-
nations was within + 0.1 ug, and + 0.2 ug for the total
nitrogen determinations.
