Introduction
Excretion of nitrogen in some form is necessary
for all animals. The simplest excretion product is
ammonia, a substance of considerable toxicity. For
this reason, comparatively few organisms excrete nitrogen
in this form. Only small aquatic organisms appear to
excrete ammonia because their aqueous environment permits
continuous release and the maintenance of subtoxic
concentrations in their tissues.
While nitrogenous excretory rates and products are
known for several oligochaetes (Needham, 1970), only
a few species of polychaetes have been examined. Hult
(1969) found that ammonia was the primary excretor,
product of the polychaete Cirraformia spirabrancha
(Moore, 1904). He also determined the rate of ammonia
excretion. Delaunay (1913) found ammonia to be the
primary excretion product of another polychaete, Aphrodite.
Since ammonia readily diffuses across biological
membranes (Milne, et. al., 1958 and Guggenheim, et. al.,
1971), it is commonly assumed that simple diffusion is
the mode of excretion in many marine invertebrates (Hoar.
1966). Again, the process of excretion has not been
closely examined in polychaetes.
In this study we determined the ammonia excretion
