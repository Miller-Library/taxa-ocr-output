Nature of Excretory Product.
The percentage of total
nitrogen excreted as ammonia was determined for four
species. The results, listed in Table 1, represent mean
values, followed by their standard deviations. Although
ammonia appears to be the major nitrogenous excretory
product of D. moniloceras and H. brevisetosa, N. acuta
appears to excrete a conspicuous part of its waste nitro¬
gen in a form other than ammonia.
Excretion Rate. The rate of ammonia excretion, expressed
as ug ammonia excreted/hour/ml. of worm, was estimated
by measuring the change in ammonia concentration in the
ambient water after four hours. The results are presented
in Table 2. In both Tables 1 and 2, one sample consisted
of 5 worms placed in 50 ml. of Instant Ocean.
The ammonia excretion rates of two species were studied
with respect to the effect of worm volume differences.
See table 3 for results. Since worm volume did appear
to influence the measurement of excretion rates, all com¬
parisons were made using comparable volumes of worms.
when the rate of excretion was measured after inter-
vals of 24 hours or longer, the results suggested lower
rates than those presented in Tadle 2. Therefore, the
ambient ammonia concentration was examined as a rate
effector in one species, D. moniloceras. The rate of
excretion was observed to decrease with increasing ambient
ammonia concentration. At a concentration of between
