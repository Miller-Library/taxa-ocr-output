Excretion in Polychaetes
rates of several Northern California polychaetes, Dorvillea
moniloceras (Moore, 1909), Halosydna brevisetosa (Kinberg,
1855), Orbinia johnsoni (Moore, 1909), and Nerinides
acuta (Treadwell, 1914), and the ammonia content of their
nitrogenous wastes. In addition, we studied the relation-
ship between the rate of excretion and the internal
ammonia concentration of D. moniloceras.
Materials and Methods
Worms were collected from Monterey Bay in Central
California and stored in running seawater in the labor-
atory for periods not exceeding one week. In each test.
worms were matched for total volume and date of collection.
The worms were blotted on paper tissues and their volume
was measured by water displacement in graduated cent-
rifuge tubes. These groups of worms were then placed
in finger bowls containing 50 ml. of Instant Ocean
(Aquarium Systems, Inc., Eastlake, Ohio). The bowls
were maintained at ambient seawater temperature. At
various intervals, 5 ml. samples were taken from the
finger bowls for analysis.
Ammonia Determination. The method of Solarazano (1969)
was used with some modification. 1 ml. of sample was
combined with 1 ml. phenol-alchohol solution, 1 ml.
sodium nitroprusside solution, and 2.5 ml. oxidizing
solution. Ammonia free water was prepared by basifying
distilled water with 1 ml. 1 N NaoH/100 ml. distilled
water, boiling for 5 minutes, then cooling and neutral-
