rnal Ammonia Concentrations. The internal ammonia

concentration of ammonia in D. moniloceras, as measured
from whole animal homogenates, varied between 45 and 55
ug/ml. worm. The internal ammonia concentration increased
when the worms were exposed to ambient ammonia concentra-
tions already shown to be inhibitory to the excretory
process. See Figure 2. The internal ammonia concentra¬
tion continued to increase with longer times of exposure
to high ambient ammonia. See Figure 3. Although ambient
ammonia concentrations known to be inhibitory for four
hours were used, worms kept in 4.8 ug/ml ambient ammonia
for 18 hours showed a rate of excretion of 1.67 ug ammonia/
ml. worm/ hour. While this is a lower than normal excre-
tion rate, it does indicate some resumption of excretion
after prolonged exposure to high ambient ammonia concen¬
tration.
Discussion
Ammonia excretion rates for the polychaetes studied
are variable both within and among species, although com-
parable to the rate of Cirriformia spirabrancha found
