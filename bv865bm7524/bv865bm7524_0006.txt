Excretion in Polychaetes

by Hult (1969). In Dorvillea moniloceras and Halosydna
brevisetosa ammonia comprises 80% or more of the total
nitrogenous wastes. This is in agreement with Delaunay's
(1913) figure of 80% for the ammonia content of the
nitrogenous excretion of Aphrodite. In Nerinides acuta
only 47% of the nitrogenous waste is excreted as ammonia,
The range in this figure is quite large, i.e., 37 to 57%.
but such variability is not uncommon. In earthworms,
fasting causes a large decrease in ammonia output (Bishop
and Campbell, 1965). The remainder of the waste product
in Nerinides acuta was not identified and should be the
subject of further study.
In all cases, high ambient ammonia concentration
caused a decrease in the ammonia excretion rate and an
increase in internal ammonia concentration of D. monilo-
ceras. In addition, worms exposed to a high concentration
of ammonia showed rates of excretion more than twice
normal when removed to water of low ammonia concentration.
Also, worms exposed to high ammonia concentrations par-
tially resumed excretion after long periods of exposure.
These observations would suggest a simple diffusion model
of excretion. However, the increase in internal concenÂ¬
tration can not be explained by reverse diffusion from
the water to the worm. Excretion appears to be inhibited
without a similar inhibition of amino acid catabolism.
The ammonia concentration of the body, 5Oug/ml., was
