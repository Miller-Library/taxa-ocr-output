INTRODUCTION
Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore, 1904) is a small polychaete
worm found in large numbers along the California coast (Ricketts
and Calvin, 1952). The worm, which bears a number of tentacles on
the anterior end of the body, lives buried in the sand or mud with
its tentacles usually out of the substrate and waving in the water.
The worm is found both intertidally and subtidally. Being basically
a sedentary animal and living in large clumps, it, or its tentacles,
should offer a food source to a number of predators. This, however.
has not been observed and no previously published literature men-
tions any predation on C. spirabrancha.
This paper is an attempt to determine whether, in fact, there
is significant predation on adult C. spirabrancha and to report an
amine present in the animal that may lessen predation.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Predation observations
Observations were carried out in the field in Pacific Grove
and Montery, California. These were made at all times of the day
and night and throughout the tidal cycle. Observations were made
both by wading in hip boots and also by scuba diving up to a depth
of 15 feet. All types of predation were looked for including pred-
ation by other invertebrates, by fish and also by shore birds.
After several weeks of field work, suspected predators were taken
into the laboratory for closer scrutiny.
The animals were maintained in 5 gallon aquaria filled with
running sea water. Two aquaria were set up for each species of
