the tissue with mortar and pestle and then homongenizing it with
a teflon homongenizer. The extract was centrifuged for 10 minutes
at 2000 rpm and the sediment disgarded.
3. Alkaline steam distillation. Extract (not centrifuged) was
raised to a pH 9.5 by the addition of 1ON NaoH and placed in a 25 ml
test tube connected by plastic tubing to a second test tube placed
in an ice bath. The tube in the ice bath was connected by a second
piece of tubing to an asperator. The tube containing the extract
was heated in a water bath and the distillate collected under
vacume.
4. Purification. Extract was mixed with an equal volume (50
ml) of IN HCl. This was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm
and the supernate saved. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of
IN HCl and again centrifuged as before. The two supernates were
pooled and then made strongly basic by the addition of lON NaoH.
This solution was extracted twice with 150 ml of anhydrous ether.
The aqueous phase was disgarded and the ether washed twice with
50 ml. of water. The ether was extracted five times with 10 ml
of 1N HCl which was pooled, washed once with ether (25 ml), and
kept for analysis.
5. Identification. The first attempt at identification was
the Hinsberg procedure for distinguishing between primary, secondary,
and tertiary amines. Further attemps at identification were those
given for amines by McElvain (1946).
