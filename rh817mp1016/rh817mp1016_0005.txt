3. Identification of noxious substance. Upon addition of the
benzenesulfonyl chloride in basic solution a white precipitate
appeared. This, however, disappeared upon dilution with water.
When made acidic a second white precipitate appeared. Although
a primary amine by the reaction in acid, the appearent positive
reaction in alkali suggests that there is a second functional
group on the molecule.
DISCUSSION
The obvious lack of predation on C. spirabrancha points to
some means of protection for the worm. On the basis of the results
it is evident that this protection is two-fold.
The first means of protection is the substrate itself. C.
spirabrancha lives in the black sand and mud found in the inter-
tidal region. This mud would probably discourage predation by
those animals which normally don't burrow as deeply as C. spiraÂ¬
brancha (i.e. H. crassicornis).
Secondly, and more important, is the bad taste of the worm
itself. Although not poisonous, the worm is noxious enough that
predators choose other prey before C. spirabrancha.
The bad taste seems to be from a compound found throughout
the body tissue. This compound can be seperated from the body
extract and the remainder of the extract is completely palatable.
The compound appears to be a primary amine-its further structure
being unknown at present.
SUMMARY
The lack of predation on C. spirabrancha seems to be due mainly
