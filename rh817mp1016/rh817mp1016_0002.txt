predator. One contained 4 inches of sand and mud and the other
had no substrate. Suspected predators were left in a tank for +
days with 10 specimens of C. spirabrancha and then specimens of
Notomastus tenuis Moore, 1909 and Lumbrineris erecta (Moore, 1904),
two other marine polychaetes, were placed in the tank and left for
another 24 hours.
Predators observed in the laboratory were: the polychaetes
Nereis grubei (Kinberg, 1866) and Glycera convoluta Keferstein,
1862; the crab Cancer gracilis Dana, 1852; the nudibranch
Hermissenda crassicornis (Eschscholtz, 1831); two types of small
intertidal fish, Oligocottus snyderi Greeley and Clinocottus
analis (Girard) (As determined by keys in Light, et. al., 1954).
Attempts were also made to directly feed the fish different
sections of C. spirabrancha, tentacles, pieces of body wall only,
and also pieces of gut alone.
Extraction and isolation
1. Assay. The assay used to detect the presence or absence
of the noxious substance in C. spirabrancha was soaking N. tenuis
or L. erecta in C. spirabrancha extract for 5 minutes and then
offering these to the fish. The same thing was also tried with the
steam distillate of extract of C. spirabrancha. If the fish rejected
the food it was assumed the noxious substance was present; if the
fish ate the food immediately it was considered absent.
2. Extraction. Extract was made of the entire body, of
tentacles alone, of body wall alone and also of the anterior and
posterior parts of the body alone. Extract was made by grinding
