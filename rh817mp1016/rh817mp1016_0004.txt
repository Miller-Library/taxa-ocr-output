of the suspected predators to C. spirabrancha. All of the predators
would eat N. tenuis or L. erecta before C. spirabrancha. The
immediate reaction by the fish tested was to spit out all parts
of C. spirabrancha taken into the mouth. All parts of the worm
were repulsive to the fish. This reaction still continued after
14 days of starvation. The only change was an increase in the number
of attempts to eat the worm. One piece was taken in the mouth 33
times between 7 different fish before being abandoned as unpalatable.
2. Presence of noxious substance. N. tenuis and L. erecta,
which normally are immediately devoured by the fish, were like-
wise spit out after being soaked in C. spirabrancha extract.
This reaction lasted, on the average, about 1 minute--the time
it would take for the water to wash the extract from the soaked
worms. After this, the fish would eat the worm. Extracts of
various parts of the body worked equally well with no localization
of the adverse compound apparent.
N. tenuis and L. erecta soaked in distillate of C. spirabrancha
extract were again unpalatable to the fish until the distillate
washed off. Worms soaked in the residue left after steam distillation
and then introduced to the fish were immediately eaten by the fish.
Injecting 1 cc of extract down the throats of several fish
produced no ill effects although the fish tried to cough it up
after it was placed in their throats.
The steam distillate had the extremely pungent odor of C.
spirabrancha extract and the ether extraction product in alkali
solution had the same characteristic odor.
