The organisms of the Phylum Mollusca differ greatly
in their nitrogenous excretory products. For example, the
land snail Helix pomatia (
has uric acid
comprising up to 903 of its excretia (Jezewska et al., 1963),
while in Octopus dofleini (Pickford, 1961) ammonia accounts
3 of the total nitrogen excreted (Emmanuel and Martin,
for
1956). The oyster Modiolus demissus (Dillwyn, 1817) posesses
both ammonia and urea as excretory products, 723 and 28%
respectively (Lum and Hammen, 1961).
Studies of the nitrogenous waste products of the class
Polyplacophora are scarce, with information available only
on Crypto
hiton stelleri (Middendorf, 1346), a large sub-
idal chiton. Myers (1920) found both ammonia and urea to
be present in the body fluids of C. stelleri as did Vasu (1965),
who found the ratio of urea to amino nitrogen in the blood
to be approximately 5:1. However, no studies of Cryptochiton
stelleri urine or urine of other chitons are to be found in
literature.
This study was undertaken in hopes of determining the
itrogenous excretory products of an intertidal chiton.
Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1940) was chosen for several reasons;
it is a large intertidal chiton readily available for collec-
tion, it is abundant along the coastline of Monterey Bay,
and most importantly, it occupies the high:
nbertidal region
(+3--5 feet) and is therefore subjected to long periods of
xposure during the tidal cycle. Therefore, it represents
a Folyplacophoran which should reveal the capabilities of
