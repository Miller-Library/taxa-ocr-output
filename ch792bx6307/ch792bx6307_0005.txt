this class for the production of non-toxic nitrogenous waste
products.
Materials and Methods
Waste products were collected by allowing the chitons
to excrete into a known volume of sea water. Rate of ex-
cretion was measured by recording the change in concentraÂ¬
tion in the water over time. This method of collection was
used only after attempts at catheterization failed. Cathe-
terization using surgical tubing inserted into the renal
pore produced too high a mortality and the fluid collected
by this method was frequently contaminated with body fluid.
Mopalia muscosa were collected from the high intertidal
regions of Ft. Pinos and South Carmel Beach. The chitons
were transferred dry to finger bowls containing 50 or 75 ml
of .22 micron filtered sea water. The time period between
removal from their natural substrate and placement in the
finger bowl never exceeded 30 minutes. The finger bowls and
all glassware used in the experiment were washed well, rinsed
with IN HCl, and then rinsed with de-ionized water.
The Solorzano method (1969) of ammonia determination was
used with one modification; de-amonified water was prepared
by adding 1 ml of 1II Naon to every 100 ml of distilled water

and boiling for 10 minutes, and when cool 1 ml of II Hol
was added for each 100 ml of distilled water. This
