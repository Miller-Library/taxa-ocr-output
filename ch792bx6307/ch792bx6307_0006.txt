de-ammonified water was used in the preparation of all
reagents and in all dilutions. Triplicate 1 ml samples
were used for ammonia determinations.
Crea conce
trations were also measured by the Solorzano
method after the urea had been broken doum to amonia by
urease. To each 1 ml water sample was added.1 ml of a
urease solution containing 50 mg/ml of Matheson, Coleman and
Bell urease. After 15 minutes of incubation at room temÂ¬
perature the samples were analyzed and corrected for ammonia
nitrogen.
Hinhydrin positive nitrogenous compounds were measured
by the method of Spies (1957) and corrected for armonia
nitrogen. A standard curve was prepared using leucine.
Aonia produces 983 of the color of this standard on a
nitrogen basis.

calculated for each l hour period. Within the three samples
collected in each time interval, there was too much vari-

ammonia or urea. However, three of the animals studied pro-
duced ninhydrin positive materials in considerable excess
