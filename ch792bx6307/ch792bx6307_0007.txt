of the ammonia excreted. Table 1 presents these results.
Figure 1 presents the time course of excretion of this
iinhydrin posit
jive material by one Mopalia muscosa. The
average rate of excretion during the first 12 hours was
18.l mg per hour of this material. The falling off of this
rate after 12 hours:
might indicate that excretion is not
continuous, and the decrease in the nitrogen level is due to
bacterial degradation.
The excretion of ammonia nitrogen shows a similar
time course and is presented in Figure 2.
Discussion
Potts (1967) reports that amino nitrogen is one of the
major components of non-prot√©in nitrogen lost from marine
molluscs. He suggests that free amino acids are lost mainly
through diffusion across the body wall. Spitzer (1937)
reports tha
tilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758) loses.
.1-1.0 mg/100g/day.of amino nitrogen, while Modiolus der
ssus
loses 1.1 mg/100g/day.
The Mopalia muscosa in Figure 1 lost .10 mg/100g/day
of what appears to be amino nitrogen, assuming 220 ug of
nitrogen to be the maximum level released over the 21 hour
period. Another M. muscosa with significant ninhydrin
i
pos
sitive results lost .60 mg/100g/day of amino nitrogen.
