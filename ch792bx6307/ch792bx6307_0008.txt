The amino nitrogen could be lost either through excretion or
fusion, although diffusion might be expected to give a
constant increase over the 21 hour sampling period. Con¬
stant increase of the ninhydrin positive material was not
observed.

of this material to excretory non-protein nitrogen will
require further study.

1) Tests for ammonia, urea, and compounds containing nin¬
hydrin positive amino groups were run on materials released
from the intertidal chiton, Mopalia muscosa.
2) Variability in the data for ammonia and urea did not allow
any conclusions to be made about their rates of excretion
over a 21 hour period. However, sig
nificant quantities of
ninhydrin positive material in excess of amonia were detected
in three Mopalia muscosa. It is uncertain whether this latter
material was lost by dif
fusion or release from the excretor
pore. The identit
y of this material has yet to be deter
mined.
