Nitrogenous materials released from
Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846), an intertidal chiton.
ABSTRACT
A study was undertaken to identify the nitrogenous
waste products released from the intertidal chiton Mopalia
muscosa (Gould, 1846). The Solorzano method was used to test
for the presence of ammonia and/or urea, while ninhydrin
positive nitrogenous compounds were identified by the Spies
method. Large variability within each sample collected from
each of five chitons did not allow a significant comparison
between levels of ammonia and urea, although both nitrogenous
compounds were present. However, in three of the M. muscosa
high levels of ninhydrin positive material were found in
comparison to the ammonia and urea levels. For one chiton
these levels were 220.4+27.2 ug of ninhydrin positive nitrogen,
42.2+4.7 ug of urea nitrogen, and 51.4+12.0 ug of ammonia
nitrogen. The ninhydrin positive nitrogen was released from
this M. muscosa at a rate of 0.48mg/100g/day. The original
paper is on file at the library, Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, California 93950.
