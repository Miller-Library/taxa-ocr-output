Acmaea pelta (Eschscholtz, 1833) is a low intertidal
species of limpet that is widely distributed on the American
west coast. A great variation in shell appearance has been
noted-Light,, especially when comparing large and
small specimens. Preliminary observations indicated a possible
correlation between habitat and morphology, which led to a
study of the distribution of A. pelta with respect to substrate
and algal association. These field studies, reported below.
indicated definite relationships between morphologic types
and habitat, leading to a study of digestive enzyme potential.
Field Studies
Field observations were done at Mussel Point, Pescadero
Point, and Cypress Point on the Monterey Peninsula,
California. Three morphologic forms of A. pelta were
observed, differing in color, shape, and length-to-height
ratios of the shell. These different forms of A. pelta
were positively identified as being variations of the
species using standard radula length and teeth determinations,
as well as the classification by jaw shape proposed
by Walker (1966). These various morphologic forms are described
below in terms of color, shell shape, and length-to-height

ratios as measured with a vernier caliper.
Norohologic Formsien
Brown form: The typical large brown A. pelta is
rized by a convex slope from the high peaked shell
charate
apex to the periphery and is often infected with the fungus
1+oral
common to shells of diberg animals of the Pacific Coast
(Boner, 1936). These brown-colored specimens are generally
over 30 mmn in length, and have a length to height ratio of
2.3 as seen in Table 1. Illustrations of the brown shells
are in Fig. 1, Group A.

small black A. pelta were observed, on the mussel beds and
on and under <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Pelvåtia fastigata.</span> Those found associated with
Pelwötia (Fig. 1, Group c) had a straight to concave slope
from the apex to edge and a characteristically cleaner shell
chan any other A. pelta form. The shell shape was flatter
than the brown 4. pelta, and had a uniform lengöh-to-height
ratio for the entire size range encountered. This flat
shell often had a rather hooked apex and a more wavy
peripheral edge than the black form seen in the mussel
beds (see below).
Black form (Mussel beds): A. pelta was found on the
mussel bed areas, generally on the mussels, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Nytilus

ratios which varied with size, as seen in Table 1. No
specimens over 20 mm were found in the beds. The profile
of the members of this form (Fig. 1, Group D) approaches
that of the large brown A. pelta. The shells of this form
are not as clean and as shiny as those found under Pelvétia,
and the shell periphery is smooth.
Green form: The third group of A. pelta, intermediate
in size between the black A. pelta on Pelvétia and the
large brown A. pelta form, are shown in Fig. 1, Group B.
This group shows a great variation in shell shape and often
displays the growth ring type of change in the exterior shell.
Most specimens are greenish-black in color. Some, however.
are almost white and others are ribbed or checkered.
Kabitat.
A survey of the intertidal zone of the Monterey Peningila
revealed fifferences in the density of the k. pelta populationge.
Mussel Point and Pescadero Point had rich populations while
Point Pinos was sparcely populated. The reason for this
uneven distribution was not investigated.
Brown form: This form of A. pelta occupies a high inshore
intertidal position from  to above 16 feet. The brown

black form found on Pelvétia. Table 2 gives the quantitative
results. Higher act
ivity was obsorved in extracts i
from the
brown animals. Low levels of fucoidinase and alginase were
consistently demonstrable at pH 7.2. No enzymatic hydrolysis
of K-carrageenin, laminarin, or agar was observed at either
pH.
Disoussion
The field work demonstrated a differonce in shell shape

of the <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. pelta found</span> in dillerent habitats in the intertidal.
t appears that shell growth and the resulting shell shape is
robably a response to the substrate upon which the animal
ves. The high peaked convex shell of the black variet
ound in the mussel beds may be an adaption to attachment
to a substrate such as is presented in the mussel beds where
large flat surfaces are at a minimum. The flatter A. pelta
under Pelvétia have an excess of flat but rough rock surface
to grow and move on. The wavy shell periphery is an indication
of an adaption to this environment. This seems to be a
reaction to the substrate similar to but not as extreme as
that of the limpet <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. scabra</span> whose shell grows to conform
to irregularities of the home site (Hewatt, 1910). A.

form and the larger soocimons from tho mussol bods. Sinco
no large spocimons woro found in the mussel bods and small
ones woro abundant, mortality may inerease with ago, tho
larger limots being unable to survivo on this aubstrato.
Substrato and exposure therofore appoar to be large factors
in dotermining sholl morphology.

Tho reason for tho different colors soon in A.

is not cloar, but a possible correlation with diffowout
algal food is plausible. Tho reported experiments do not
ate that digestivo potential is tho critical

Tactor. Thoy also shou that alginic acid and fucoidin could
be utilized only slouly in comparasen to utilization of
tarch. Althouch extracts prepared from broun forms
displayed more activity tham thoso obtainod from blach ones,
this di foronce may bo simply rolated to tho onso of
