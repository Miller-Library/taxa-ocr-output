ACKNOW LEDGEMENTS
lâ€™d like to express my gratitude to Dr. Mazia for his guidance, support,
friendship, and a great dinner. Working with you has undoubtedly been a unique
experience for which I am very greatful. Special thanks goes to Chris Patton for
assistance both in the Mazia lab and photo lab. I am also indebted to Dr. Stuart
Thompson and Megavision Studios" for recovering my time-lapse videos/ data
from the dead. Emile, you deserve a good portion of recognition for cleaning my
dirty glassware as fast as I produced it. John, your popcorn, coffee, and company
kept me sane that day my data was destroyed. S. Purp, thank you for the results I
wanted. 663 Spencer Street *1, you treated me very well; I will not ever forget
the good times, recipe swapping. Simpsons Nights, pillow fights, and the people I
lived there with. And everyone else-the Spring students and those that chatted
with me in the halls and labs-you are also in every bit of this paper. Thank you.
I had a fun time.
