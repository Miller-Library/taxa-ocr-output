Figure 1. First Cleavage." Ammonia-activated centrifuged fragments. Approx.
activation/fertilization time (hrs:min) (a-d) 1:20-2:05. EH, enucleate half; NH
nucleate half; FC, fertilized control; UC, uncentrifuged control. Arrows
indicate fragments that exhibited the most movement. (inverse Megavision

Figure 2. Explosions.â€œ Ammonia-activated centrifuged fragments.
Approx. activation/fertilized time (hrs:min) (a) 4:57 (b) 6:36. EH,
enucleate half; EQ, enucleate quarter; CC. centrifuged control. Arrows
indicate fragments observed to "explode" (not all shown).

activation/fertilization time (hrs:min) (a-d) 5:34-7:14. EH, enucleate half; EO,
enucleate quarter; FC, fertilized.
Figure 4. Astral microtubule structure (Daniel Mazia). Ammonia-activated
bisected fragments. Isolation time 1:45 (hrs:min). (a) light microscopy
(b) DAPI staining and fluorescence microscopy. Arrows indicate fragments
with astral microtubule structure. EH, enucleate half; NH, nucleate half.
