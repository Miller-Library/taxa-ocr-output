2-
approximately 25 kidneys or digestive glands were minced in artificial
sea water (McLeod, Onofrey, and Norris 1954) adjusted to pH 7.0
and then distributed among 10 test tubes in 0.5 ml aliquots.
Substrate was added and the activity of any enzyme which may have
been present was stopped by the addition of dilute sulfuric acid
and sodium tungstate solution, the final solution having a pH of
7.0. In each test, a set of controls containing tissue extract or
substrate alone were run simultaneously and treated in the same
manner as described above.
An arginine monohydrochloride solution, .85 M, was prepared
and the pH adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of 10% NaoH solution.
The urea substrate was prepared by dissolving 6 grams in 100 ml of
artificial sea water to make a.1 M solution. Uric acid, 16.8 grams,
was dissolved in 50 ml of artificial sea water to make a.2 M solution.
This solution was prepared fresh before each series of tests.
Hypoxanthine, 68 mg, was added to 10 ml of .05 M NaoH to make a
.85 M hypoxanthine solution at pH 8.3.
Ammonia was detected by Nesslerization (Haden 1923). Urea was
detected similarily after treatment with urease (Sumner 1926).
Uric acid was assayed by the method of Benedict (1924). All
colorimetric measurements were made in a Klett-Summerson Photo-
electric colorimeter.
Arginase activity was estimated by following the production
of urea from arginine. Xanthine oxidase activity was estimated
by following the production of uric acid from hypoxanthine.
Uricase activity was estimated by following the decrease in uric
acid. Urease activity was estimated by following the production of
