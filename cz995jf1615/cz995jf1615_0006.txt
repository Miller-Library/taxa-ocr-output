not of significant importance.
3. Xanthine oxidase is shown to present in the kidney of this snail,
though hitherto, it has not been found in other marine invertebrates.
(Baldwin and Needham 1934). It is suggested that this enzyme maybe
responsible for formation of uric acid in Littorina planaxis and other
members of this group, whether the uric acid is derived ultimately
from nucleic acid breakdown or from protein deamination.
4. The uricotelic character of the metabolism of this gastropod
is supported by the presence of urease, uricase, and xanthine oxidase
in the kidney tissue and indicate a mechanism which can account for
most of the nitrogen excretory products.
