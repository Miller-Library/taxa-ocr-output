Pathways of Nitrogen Excretion in
Littorina planaxis
In the kidneys and livers of animals having ureotelic mechanisms
of excretion, according to Clementi (1915; 1918), the enzyme arginase,
important in urea formation through the Krebs ornithine cycle, is
present in high concentration, whereas those which have a uricotelic
mechanism have a much lower concentration of this enzyme and
possess other enzymes such as xanthine oxidase which is important
in the formation of uric acid from purines synthesized from amino
acids. These organisms may also possess the additional enzymes
dricase and urease to degrade the uric acid which is formed from
the purine bases to urea and ammonia (Needham and Baldwin 1934). This
study will show that Littorina planaxis falls into the category
of uricotelic organisms since much of this organism's waste nitrogen
is first converted to uric acid. Estimations of specific enzymes
such as xanthine oxidase can give some insight into the possible
excretory pathways involved. In addition, since many organisms
continue the degradation of uric acid into simpler compounds before
excretion, tests for uricase and urease are of importance so that
a clear understanding of the overall excretory process may be
obtained.
Experimental Procedure
The essential basis of all the methods which have been employed
for the detection of arginase, uricase, urease, and xanthine oxidase
consisted in following the conversion of the substrates arginine,
uric acid, urea, and hypoxanthine respectively. In each test,
