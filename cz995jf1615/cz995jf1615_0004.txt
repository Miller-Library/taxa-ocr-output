ammonia from urea.
Results and Discussion
The results of the experiment are presented in Table 1. Arginase,
an enzyme present in most terrestrial organisms, could not be detected
in any of the tests performed on Littorina planaxis indicating that
the formation of urea arises through pathways other than the Krebs
ornithine cycle. To account for the relatively large amounts of
urea excreted, the breakdown of uric acid seems to be an excellent
possibility.
It is possible that synthesis of less oxidized purine compounds
such as hypoxanthine and xanthine from amino acid nitrogen could
provide xanthine oxides. Xanthine oxidase would deal not only with
the nitrogenous compounds ultimately derived from nucleic acid
catabolism, but also with nitrogen derived from protein catabolism
as well. An active xanthine oxidase was found to be present in the
kidney tissue of this snail. Therefore, the majority of the uric acid
produced within the snail could be accounted for through the metabolism
of purine bases either ingested and degraded directly or synthesized
from other nitrogenous compounds.
Table 2 shows that the degradation of uric acid by way of uricase
leads to the production of ammonia. This conversion indicates that
allantoinase and allantoinase are present as well as the assayed urease.
These snails appear to have specialized more than many invertebrate
groups in the production of uric acid as a nitrogenous end product
as can be seen from the results of these tests and those of Needham
and Baldwins' (1934). These tests also show that further degradation
of uric acid does in fact occur with the help of the enzymes uricase
