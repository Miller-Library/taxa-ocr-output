and urease which are both present and which are responsihle for the
two important end products, urea and ammonia.
The uricolytic cycle has been well worked out by Florkin and
Ducha'teau (Florkin, 1960). The first stage in the process of
uricolysis consists in the oxidation of uric acid itself to the
more soluble substance, allantoin, under the influence of uricase.
Allantoin is further degraded through a series of steps. The urea
produced in this eycle is further degraded by the action of urease
which is present in significant amounts in the snail Littorina
planaxis to give ammonia.
The majority of the conversions takes place within the kidney-
heart complex. The digestive gland tissue failed to show significant
enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the existence of these enzymes
in the kidney could possibly be an evolutionary adaptation allowing
the snails to produce excretory products according to the availability
of water. This mechanism may also be an intermediate step toward
terrestrial life.
Summary
1. An account is given of the experiments designed to elucidate
the sources and modes of formation of the excreted urea, uric acid, and
ammonia in the marine gastropod Littorina planaxis.
2. It is suggested that arginase is not concerned with the
production of urea in the members of this species because no correlation
was found between the amount of urea and arginase activity. In the
production of urea and ammonia, which represent the principal
nitrogenous end products of the Littorines, the enzyme arginase is
