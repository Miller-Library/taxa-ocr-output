Conclusion
O. rubescens numbers on a transect along the 200 m depth contour in
Monterey Bay fluctuated significantly from 1991 to 1997. This study found
that the large population of O. rubescens seen along the transect in 1991 may
have been partially due to a combination of two factors. The first is lower
rockfish predation pressure on octopus populations in 1991 as a result of a
large rockfish take in 1990. The second is large 1989 and 1990 juvenile octopus
abundances in the water column recruiting to the benthic community in
1991.
It was harder to establish what factors may have contributed to smaller
populations of O. rubescens numbers in 1997 because of incomplete fishery
and juvenile octopus data. However, possible factors include greater
predation pressure from increased numbers of rockfishes and harbor seals.
Although not specifically investigated in this study, whole transect
changes such as increases in relative abundances and species diversity were
also observed. While this study has begun to investigate factors contributing
to changes in a population of O. rubescens at 200 m, further research is
required to elucidate the complex factors contributing to changes in deep sea
benthic communities in the Monterey Bay.
