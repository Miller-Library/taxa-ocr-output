determined. No swarms greater than 20 octopuses per frame were observed.
Total numbers of juveniles seen per year were divided by total
numbers of dive hours for that year. Dive hours were estimated to the
nearest half an hour and included videos where no octopuses were seen. The
resulting index was a measure of juvenile octopus abundance per year.
Chlorophyll Data
Mean chlorophyll levels from 1989 to 1996 were used as an indicator of mean
phytoplankton abundance in the upper portion of the water column.
Average yearly measurements of chlorophyll levels (ug 1*) occurring at 0
depth in the water column were calculated using chlorophyll measurements
obtained from MBARI (Chavez, unpubl. data). It was assumed that levels of
chlorophyll, and thus phytoplankton abundance at the surface, reflected
general food availability for juvenile octopuses.
From these data, regression relationships between chlorophyll and
juvenile octopus abundances were estimated using time lags of zero, one, and
two years. This relationship was used to establish relationships between
fluctuations in standing crop of phytoplankton, and thus possibly
zooplankton abundance, and fluctuations in juvenile octopus numbers.
Harbor Seal Data
Predation intensity by harbor seals was estimated from the occurrence of
octopus beaks in seal scat. To estimate numbers of beaks in scats from the
early 1990's, numbers of beaks found in seal scat taken from Elkhorn Slough
