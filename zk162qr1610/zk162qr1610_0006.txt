of 1991 transect and 9154.1 m of 1997 transect was used in the analysis. The
width of the 1991 transect was 1.8 m (Adams et al., 1995). The width of the
1997 transect, 3.1 m, was calculated by using the constant distance between two
laser points (28 cm) and extrapolating the transect width from the total
monitor width. Because the laser system was only operating at the end of the
transect run, the width calculated from the lasers during this time was
assumed to be the same as the average width of the whole transect. 1o
account for differing total areas seen in 1991 and 1997, all density estimates
were normalized to number of organism per hectare (10,000 m2).
Portions of the video tape from 1991 and 1997 were unusable and
omitted from transect analysis. Reasons for omission included: the ROV was
too far above the substrate for organisms to be counted and identified, the
ROV was sitting on the bottom motionless, the ROV wandered + 20 m off of
the 200 m contour, or the recorded length of a segment between two time
points was too large to be reasonable.
A G-test of independence (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981) was used to test for
changes in relative abundance occurring from 1991 to 1997. Additionally the
Shannon Index was used as a measure of species diversity (-2p, In(p), where
p=proportion of the iâ€œ species; Magurran, 1988). Student's t-tests were
performed on sub-sampled data in order to establish if octopus and rockfish
numbers had changed significantly between 1991 and 1997. Octopus variances
were significantly different (F-test, P20.01), requiring the use of an unequal
variance t-test. Rockfish data were log transformed resulting in homogenous
