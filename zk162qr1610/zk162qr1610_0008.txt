Juvenile Octopus Data
Numbers of juveniles in the water column were calculated from mid-water
transect videos obtained from MBARI's video database. All mid-water
transects occurred at a regularly sampled site at the axis of the Monterey
Canyon, and spanned the years of 1989 to 1995. A search of the general
database, which consisted of video through 1994, resulted in 40 transects
where octopuses were recorded. A second database consisting mainly of 1995
video was searched, and an additional 9 transects were identified as having
octopuses. Sections of video annotated as having sightings of single
octopuses were not examined, and a single octopus was recorded to have been
seen. Sections of video annotated as having sightings of octopus populations
were viewed and the number of octopuses seen were recorded.
Quantifying numbers of juveniles became much more difficult if
swarms of octopus were spotted. Swarms of octopuses often faded into the
distance, with individuals fading in and out of focus. Additionally, because
swarms often covered an area larger than the cameraâ€™s field of view,
individuals swimming off screen could swim back through a moment later
and be counted more than once. In order to standardize how groups of
octopuses were counted, a grading system was employed. A population score
of 5 was given to any swarm where 5 to 9 individuals could be seen in the
video frame at any given moment. A population score of 10 was given for to
swarms of 10 to 14 individuals, and a score of 15 was given to swarms of 15 or
greater. For groups of less than 5 individuals, the exact number present was
