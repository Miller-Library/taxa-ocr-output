variances (F-test, P-0.28), and t-tests were performed on these transformed
data.
Fishery Data
Fishery data from 1980 to 1986 were obtained from the California Department
of Fish and Game. To monitor fish landings, the Department of Fish & Game
has divided the Monterey Bay into a series of 18 km by 18 km quadrats.
Fishing activity is monitored in each quadrat, and type of fishing, depth of
fishing (if trawling is used), length of fishing run, and pounds of each species
or market group caught are recorded. For this study, data of rockfish taken by
otter trawl along the 200 m + 20 m depth contour from Fish & Game block 518
were used. Most of the transect fell within this quadrat area, although the 200
m + 20 m depth contour within block 518 was about twice as long as the total
transect length.
Pounds of rockfish taken per year (hereafter referred to as "take") were
used as an indicator of fishing stress on the rockfish population, while
pounds of rockfish per hour of fishing time was used as a rough indicator of
rockfish abundance. It was assumed that changes in take and abundance
along the whole 200 m + 20 m depth contour in block 518 fluctuated in the
same manner as take and abundance along the length of the transect.
