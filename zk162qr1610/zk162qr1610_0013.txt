of the fluctuations seen in octopus numbers (Fig. 7). For abundances plotted
lagging octopus abundance one and two years behind chlorophyll abundance,
resulting chlorophyll fluctuations explained 34% and 13% of the fluctuations
seen in juvenile octopus abundance (Fig. 8 and 9).
Harbor Seal Data
The numbers of octopus beaks per scat sample decreased from approximately
5.5 during the early 1990’s to approximately 1.5 during the mid to late 1990's
(n=547, 99, Fig. 10).
Discussion
Evidence suggests that fishing pressure, factors affecting the numbers of
pelagic juvenile octopus recruiting to the benthic community, and increases
in predation pressure by increasing numbers of harbor seals contributed to the
significant fluctuations in Octopus rubescens populations between 1991 and
1997. Additionally, these or other factors may be affecting community-wide
patterns of relative abundance and diversity.
The study site is located in one of three most heavily fished areas in the
Monterey Bay, with the 200m depth contour being the most heavily trawled
depths in this site (Bob Leos, Dept. of F&G, per. com.). Rockfishes, a target
species for trawl fisheries, use cephalopods as a major food source (Houk,
1992). Increases in rockfish numbers, from 46 ha“ in 1991 to 54 ha in 1997,
accompanied by decreases in octopus numbers, from 853 ha’ to 3 ha", support
