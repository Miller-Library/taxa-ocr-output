Abstract
In October of 1991, a National Marine Fishery Survey conducted at the 200 m
depth contour along a segment of sand-mud canyon bottom between
Ascension Canyon and Monterey Canyon in the Monterey Bay revealed an
unusually large population of Octopus rubescens (852 octopuses ha,
SE=179.8). When re-sampled in March of 1997 using a remotely operated
vehicle (ROV), the O. rubescens population was found to have significantly
decreased in size (3 octopuses ha", SE-3.2, pÂ«0.001). Fishery effects on
predatory rockfish and factors affecting juvenile recruitment were found to be
the most plausible causes for the large 1991 O. rubescens populations. The
effect of these factors could not be established for the smaller 1997 populations
because of insufficient data. Large increases in numbers of harbor seals, Phoca
vitulina, within the bay may be contributing significantly to the O. rubescens
decline.
