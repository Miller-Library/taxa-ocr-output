Introduction
The factors leading to population fluctuations in the deep sea benthic
communities of Monterey Bay are not clearly understood. Without a
knowledge of these factors, human impacts on marine ecosystems cannot
fully be quantified. In 1991, a National Marine Fisheries Survey discovered a
large population of Octopus rubescens (one every 0.8 m), along a section of
sand-mud canyon floor at 200 m depth (Charles Baxter, per. com.). Such an
unusual population provided an unique opportunity to investigate factors
which may be having obvious effects on a population sizes of a species in the
Monterey Bay.
O. rubescens is found from Alaska to Baja California to the Gulf of
California (Hochberg and Fields, 1980). The life span of the O. rubescens
ranges from one (Hochberg and Fields, 1980) to two years (Dorsey, 1976), with
juveniles spending an unknown amount of time in a pelagic phase. While
in the water column, juveniles stay at depths of 400 m or less (Hunt, 1996),
and feed mainly on zooplankton (Dorsey, 1976). Adult O. rubescens inhabit a
variety of habitats ranging from shallow water kelp beds to sand-mud canyon
bottoms at up to 250 m depth, and feed mainly on crustaceans, mollusks, and
fishes (Hochberg and Fields, 1980).
The goals of this research were to both determine how the population
of O. rubescens along the transect had changed from 1991 to 1997, as well as to
