A second factor that may have led to the large change in octopus
numbers along the transect is a fluctuation in the numbers of juveniles
recruiting to the benthic community. This hypothesis is supported by high
abundances of octopuses in the two years immediately preceding the large
population of benthic octopuses found in 1991 (Fig. 6). Because large
abundances of juveniles were found in the two years preceding 1991, the data
are consistent for both a one and two year O. rubescens life cycle.
It is difficult to establish how recruitment class size affected 1997
benthic numbers because class size numbers for 1996 are not available.
Juvenile abundance since 1989 generally decreased (Fig. 6), with small
increases in both 1994 and 1995. If O. rubescens has a two year life cycle, the
1995 class may indicate the 1997 population size. Although juvenile
abundance in 1995 was lower than in 1989 and 1990 (20.8 juveniles hour
compared to =1.8 to 2.3 juveniles hourâ€™), it is unlikely that this slight decrease
in abundance alone accounts for a change of two orders of magnitude in
benthic octopus numbers from 1991 to 1997.
Potential factors that may affect juvenile abundance include: the size of
the larval pool produced by benthic adults, the availability of food for
juveniles in the water column, or sources of juvenile mortality such as
predation. Since juvenile abundance in the years after the large benthic
population of 1991 was smaller than previous years (Fig. 6), it seems unlikely
that adult abundance strongly influences juvenile abundance.
