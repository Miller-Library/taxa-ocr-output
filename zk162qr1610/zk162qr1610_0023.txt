Figure 1: Study site in Monterey Bay with transect area marked by solid dark
line along the 200 m depth contour.
Figure 2: Decrease in O. rubescens population along the transect site from
1991 to 1997 with area normalized to one hectare. Vertical bars
indicate standard error. Numbers used reflect abundances found
along transect sub-samples.
Figure 3: Inverse population changes of O. rubescens and rockfishes along the
transect from 1991 to 1997. O. rubescens decrease and corresponding
rockfish increase. Numbers used reflect abundances found
along transect sub-samples.

Figure 5: Fishery impact on the rockfish population from 1980 to 1996. Plot of
pounds of rockfish taken per year and rockfish abundance per year
(Abundance is determined by pounds of rockfish taken per hour of
fishing).
Figure 6: Fluctuation in abundances of juvenile octopuses in the water
column from 1989 to 1995.
