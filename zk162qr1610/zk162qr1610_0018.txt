likely such decreases in numbers of octopus beaks are reflections of shrinking
numbers of octopuses available as prey items.
It is difficult to extrapolate the Elkhorn Slough seal scat data to the area
of the 1991 and 1997 transects. The Elkhorn Slough seals tend to dive in areas
further to the south-east of the transect site, diving in and around the
Monterey Canyon closer to Elkhorn Slough (Tomo Eguchi, per com.).
Additionally, the majority of dives, 11329 out of 16403 were to depths less
than 75m (Tomo Eguchi, unpubl. data). In order to document the impact of
seal predation on the transect area, more research is required.
Along with the changes in octopus populations along the transect from
1991 to 1997, changes in the rest of the benthic community were also evident.
Results from the G-test of independence suggest that relative abundances of
species present on the transect have changed significantly over this time
period (Table 1, Fig. 4). Additionally, Shannon's Diversity Index indicates a
significant decrease in diversity from 1991 to 1997. From the research
conducted, it is difficult to conclude what these changes may indicate;
however, as seen through the investigation of fluctuations in O. rubescens
populations, many factors may be working together to create the community
wide changes found along the transect.
