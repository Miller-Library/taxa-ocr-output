the idea of a significant interaction between these two populations. Because
of this, fishery activity along the transect area may be influencing octopus
populations by affecting the numbers of predatory rockfish.
It is not possible to determine the exact relationship between octopus
abundance and fishery pressure. However, based on the assumption that
rockfish take is affecting rockfish abundance and that rockfish abundance is
affecting octopus abundance, the large rockfish take in 1990 followed by lower
rockfish abundance in 1991 may have released octopuses from predation
pressure in 1991. Such a release may have allowed octopus survival rates to
be greater than normal along the transect, resulting in the larger population
of octopuses found in 1991.
It is harder to establish how fishing activity may have contributed to
the greatly reduced octopus numbers seen in 1997. For reasons presented
above (see results), fishery data predict a low rockfish abundance in 1997.
Findings from video analysis, however, indicate that rockfish populations
have increased significantly over the area of the transect in 1997. Although
this result seems to contradict fishery predictions, it may be that the 1997
rockfish population, although decreasing from populations found in 1996, is
still larger than populations found in 1991. Regardless, it is unlikely that the
small increase in rockfish abundance, from 46 to 54 ha", fully explains the
large decrease in octopus population found in 1997. More research is needed
to establish connections between fishery activity and octopus population
decreases.
