simultaneously with location and were recorded to the nearest meter. Using
telemetry as a guide, the path of the ROV tracked the 200 m contour as closely
as possible. The average height above the substrate was 0.87 m, and average
speed of the ROV varied because of strong tail currents. For detailed
descriptions of the ROV camera specifications see Adams et al., (1995
Video Analysis
Video tapes of both the 1991 and 1997 transects were viewed at least three
times to identify organisms found along the transect. All visible organisms
on the video tape were identified to the lowest taxonomic level, and their
abundances were recorded.
O. rubescens were sub-sampled in order to quantify the large change in
population numbers observed from 1991 to 1997. Rockfishes were similarly
sub-sampled due to possible biological interactions between octopus and
rockfish populations. To obtain sub-sampled areas, the 1991 and 1997
transects were divided into 52 and 93 segments, respectively, with each
segment being as close to 100 m as possible. The length of each segment was
determined from the difference between successive location estimates. Ten
segments were randomly chosen from each transect sample, and octopus and
rockfish numbers were counted and recorded.
Total transect area was calculated by multiplying transect width by
transect length. Transect length was determined by summing distances
between successive Northing and Easting measurements. A total of 5984.1 m
