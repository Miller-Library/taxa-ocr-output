from January 1991 to December 1991 (Oxman, pers. com.) were averaged with
numbers of beaks found in Slough scats from May 1991 to May 1992 (Trumble,
1995). Estimates of numbers of beaks found in scats for the mid to late 1990's
was determined from scat samples collected from September 1995 to
September 1996 (Tomo Eguchi, unpubl. data).
The 1995-1996 beak numbers were determined by counting beaks
already extracted from scat samples obtained for a different study (Tomo
Eguchi, unpubl data). The greatest number of either upper or lower beaks was
used as the total number of beaks per scat. For both the early 90's and mid to
late 90's, total beak numbers found in scat samples over the year were divided
by total numbers of scats collected during the year to obtain an index of
average beaks per scat per year.
Results
Transect Analysis
Octopus rubescens decreased significantly from a mean of 852 ha“ in 1991 to 3
hal in 1997 (t-test, P«0.001, SE=179.8, 3.2, Fig. 2). An increase in body size was
also noted among octopuses from the two samples, from approximately 5 cm
in 1991 to 20 cm in 1997. Sizes were estimated as general size of the animal
when sitting on the substrate and not strictly mantle size.
Rockfish numbers increased significantly from a mean of 42 ha“ in
1991 to 54 ha“ in 1997 (t-test, P«.04, SE’s-32.3, 14.6, Fig. 3). Qualitative changes
were also noted for body size of rockfishes. Most rockfishes along the transect
