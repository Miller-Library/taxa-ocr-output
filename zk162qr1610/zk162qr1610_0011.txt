in 1991 were approximately 20 to 40 cm total body length. The majority of
rockfishes observed in 1997 were also in this 20 to 40 cm size class. However,
there was an additional class of smaller rockfish, approximately 10 cm in
length or smaller. Distribution of the rockfish population also changed from
patchy in 1991, to more evenly spread along the transect in 1997.
Relative abundances of other species found along the transect changed
significantly (G.g=65.3, P«0.001). Octopus and rockfish populations were
excluded from this calculation because their significance was already
determined. Largest decreases in abundance from 1991 to 1997 included: the
sea urchin Allocentrotus fragilis, slender sole (Eopsetta exilis), sand star
(Luidia foliolata), and red sea star (Mediaster aequalis). Largest increases in
abundances from 1991 to 1997 included: bigfin eelpout (Lycodes cortezianus),
the sea star Rathbunaster californicus, and spotted cusk-eel (Chilara taylori)
(Fig. 4).
Species richness decreased from 27 in 1991 to 22 in 1997 and total
diversity, as measured by the Shannon index, decreased significantly (H' for
1991 = 1.53, H' for 1997 = 1.02,t-7.41, P««0.001, Table 1)
Fishery Data
Rockfish take and abundance fluctuated from 1980 to 1996 between years of
high take-high abundance and low take-low abundance (Fig. 5). Take is
assumed to be a measure of stress inflicted on the rockfish population by the
fishery because high take years are followed by low abundance years. It was
