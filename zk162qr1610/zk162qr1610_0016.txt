The juvenile's food chain is short: O. rubescens eats zooplankton,
which grazes on phytoplankton. Such a relationship makes it feasible that
fluctuations in the production of phytoplankton affect juvenile abundances
by affecting abundances of the juvenile’s prey. Juveniles feed upon mystids,
copepods and ostracods (Adams et al., 1995). Although there were no data
available on population sizes of these prey items during this study, the
positive slopes between juvenile octopus abundances and chlorophyll
concentrations suggests that food may indeed be important. The greater
correlation found between octopus abundances and chlorophyll
concentrations the previous year may be a result of delayed effects of
phytoplankton abundances on zooplankton abundances, and consequently
delayed effects on juvenile numbers. Factors that could affect prey abundance
include natural nutrient cycles in the Monterey Bay, changes in current
patterns or other meso-scale oceanographic processes. Because none of the
correlations were statistically significant, more data points are needed
positively determine the relationship between chlorophyll concentration and
juvenile octopus abundance.
Sources of predation on juvenile octopuses are not known, but
mortality rate among juveniles is probably high. The lower r’ for the
correlation of octopus abundances and chlorophyll concentrations from two
years prior may be due to a greater chance for sources of mortality, including
predation while in the water column, to occur between the recruitment of
one cohort and the production of the next generation of juveniles. More
