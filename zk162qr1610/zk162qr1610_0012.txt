assumed, therefore, that a high take could negatively affect the rockfish
population by reducing it to a low level in subsequent years. A large take of
approximately 45000 lb. of rockfish in 1990 was followed by a low abundance
of 250 lb. of rockfish caught fishing hrâ€™ in 1991. In 1995 and 1996 a take of
approximately 25,000 lb. and 48,000 lb. of rockfish was coupled with
abundances of approximately 300 and 400 lb. fishing hr". The large take in
1996 reflects a larger number of hours of fishing rather then a high abundance
of rockfish. From the previously seen pattern of high take years being
followed by low abundance years, a low abundance of rockfish is expected in
1997.
Juvenile Octopus Data
There was a general trend of decreasing numbers of juvenile octopuses in the
water column from 1989 (=2.25 octopus hr*) to 1993 (=0.4 octopus hr*), with
slight increases in numbers occurring in 1994 (20.41 octopus hr*) and 1995
(=0.08 octopus hr, Fig. 6).
Chlorophyll abundance versus juvenile octopus abundance were
plotted in three different ways. While all scatter plots had positive slopes,
none had statistically significant correlations. This lack of statistical
significance was probably due to the small number of points plotted as
opposed to a lack of correlation, especially for the octopus abundance which
was lagged by one year. For directly plotted abundances, the best fit line
indicated that fluctuations in mean yearly chlorophyll accounted for only 1%
