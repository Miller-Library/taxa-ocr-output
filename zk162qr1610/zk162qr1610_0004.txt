investigate some of the factors which may be causing changes in populations
of the O. rubescens.
Due to the history of commercial fishing in the area of the transect, as
well as the life history of the O. rubescens, fishery activity and factors affecting
O. rubescens survival during their time in the pelagic phase were both
investigated as possible causes of population fluctuation. Additionally,
because of increases in numbers of harbor seals in the area, predation pressure
from seals was also investigated.
Methods
Study Site
The study site is located on a section of sand-mud ocean bottom at 200 m
depth between Monterey and Ascension canyons (Fig. 1). For a detailed
description of the transect area see Adams et al. (1995). The transect began at
N 36° 47’ latitude W 122° 06' longitude and extended for approximately
10 km, ending at approximately N 36° 48' latitude W 122° 08' longitude.
Transect Sampling
The 1991 transect was re-sampled on March 21, 1997 using the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI) remotely operated vehicle (ROV),
Ventana. ROV location was measured every few seconds using a combined
navigational system consisting of a differential global positioning system and
a sonar system. RÖV depth and altitude off substrate were measured
