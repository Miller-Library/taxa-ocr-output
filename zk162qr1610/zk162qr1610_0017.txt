research is required to discover what effects predation may have on
abundances of juvenile octopuses in the water column.
The final factor that may have led to population fluctuations among O.
rubescens along the transect area is the increase in predation pressure from
harbor seals. With exception of the El Nino years of 1983 and 1993, California
harbor seal populations have been growing every year since the Marine
Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972 (Barlow et al., 1995). An annual
growth rate between the years of 1982 and 1994 was calculated as 4.1% (Barlow
et al., 1995). However, annual growth rates have been estimated at as high as
14.7% (Oxman, 1995
Harbor seals are benthic predators that consume 2.5-5.0% of their body
weight per day (Oxman, 1995). Through such feeding habits, harbor seals may
affect populations in the Monterey Bay. Oxman (1995) found that octopus, as
measured by octopus beaks in scat, accounted for approximately 35% of prey
items found in Elkhorn Slough harbor seal scat during three seasons of the
year. Additionally, for these three seasons, octopus was the most common
prey item in the scat (Oxman, 1995). Seals forage over the entire depth
distribution range of O. rubescens: O. rubescens is found to 200 or 250 m,
while seals dive to 500 m (Tomo Eguchi, per. com.).
Because harbor seals are opportunistic predators, it is unlikely that the
decreases in numbers of beaks found per scat, from 5.5 in the early 1990 to 1.5
in the mid to late 1990's, were a result of a change in prey preference. More
