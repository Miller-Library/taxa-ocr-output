DDT treatment in all these cases increased the
output of normal firing in ng; coordination of the
spikes, as viewed through the "size principle" and
inhibitory neuronal responses, remained as before
treatment.
In the one preparation taken from the 100 ppb DDT
solution of section I (1.4 ppm whole animal concentration)

clearly longer than either control. Also neurons 5
and 6 could be easily tactually elicited. Again the
coordination between neurons appeared normal.
Discussion
The behavioral observations of the first section
indicate that a whole animal concentration of 1.4 ppm
is about at the threashold where large behavioral
effects can be observed. While most of the DDT found
in Emerita in the field is probably stored in lipids,
under the experimental conditions the crab might not
have been able to transfer much to the lipids,
leaving more free to be taken up by the nervous
system. Nevertheless, this level is comparable to
the 0.92 ppm DDT or 1.2 ppm DDT plus DDD concentrations
found in animals from the Los Angeles area (1). (This
