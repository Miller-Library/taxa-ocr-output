Introduction
The effects of the insecticide DDT (11) on the
nerves of various animals has been the focus of many
neurophysiological studies in the past. These studies
have mainly attempted to explain the mode of action
and effect of DDT on single neurons. The changes
shown in single cells are (a) repetitive afterdischarge
and (b) prolongation of the action potential (6; 7).
These two effects appear to manifest themselves
behaviorly in hyperexcitability, ataxia, convulsion
and death. Also DDT's effect both on single cells
and on observable behavior increase with amount of
exposure to DDT (3; 6; 8). This work, however, was
all done using high concentrations of DDT far above
levels found in the natural environment.
Since DDT has effects which accumulate with
exposure, it seems reasonable that more subtle
behavioral effects may also occur before the obvious
symptoms described. I believe that electrophysiological
techniques may make a sensitive indicator of such
subtle behavioral aberrations.
This study focused on the question of whether
levels of DDT found in the natural environment and
levels that cause measurable motor changes in the
