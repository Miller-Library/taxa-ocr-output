the center of bursts when all neurons are firing.
This is shown in the fast traces in figure 2.
The Effect of DDT
One ppm DDT caused an increase in both the amount
of spontaneous bursting (figure 3) and the length of
bursts elicited tactually (figure 4). In the seven
preparations done at this concentration, spontaneous
bursting occurred 5 to 30 minutes after DDT was
applied. By 60 minutes, firing of neurons 1 thru 4
was nearly continuous; large bursts, that included
neurons 5 and 6, were as frequent as every 5 to 10
seconds. After 60 minutes, tactually elicited bursts
continued 5 to 30 seconds after stimulation.
Previously quiescent spike 6 fired frequently after
DDT treatment. Attempts to reverse the effects by
returning the animal to seawater were not sucessful.
Two control preparations were run and these
showed only isolated spiking (neurons 1-4) and
infrequent small bursts (approx. one every 20-30
minutes). The two largest neurons could not be
elicited.
A bathing liquid concentration of 100 ppb DDT
elicited spontaneous bursting only after 1 hour and
this never reached the level seen with the higher
concentration solution. The length of bursting
elicited tactually, however, increased markedly and
very large bursts containing all the neurons were
