abdomens extended and dissected to expose the third
and fourth abdominal ganglia. Seawater between 14
and 19Â° C was used as a bathing medium (10).
Electrophysiological recordings were made with
a single suction electrode (the nerve was cut distill
to the electrode). Nerve activity was displayed on
an oscilloscope and photographed. Tactile stimulation
was done by touching or brushing with a glass rod.
Electrical recordings of neural activity were
made before and after the introduction of DDT. The
DDT solutions were the same as described in section
I as was the 0.1% acetone control. The one preparation
which had taken up DDT from the 100 ppb
solution of section I (1.4 ppm whole animal concentraion)
was dissected and recordings made in seawater.
Characterization of Nerves Studied
Results of the anatomical study are shown in
figure 1. The nerve (ng) studied leaves the nerve
cord between the third and fourth abdominal ganglia
and apparently innervates the fast flexor muscles
of the fourth abdominal segment.
Six different neurons were identified by their
spike shapes (figure 24) though a seventh may be
present (figure 2B). This seventh spike, labeled
3', was usually seen next to 3 in photographs and
with its similar shape and heigth may be the same.
