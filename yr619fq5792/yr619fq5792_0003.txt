I. Behavioral Analysis
In order to test for gross behavioral effects 3
adult female sand crabs, Emerita analoga (Simpson),
were placed in each of six 2 liter beakers containing
1 liter of constantly areated seawater, 1 cm. layer
of sand and differing concentrations of DDT.
Concentrations (in ppb (12)) of 5000, 1000, 100, 10,
5 and 0 (control) DDT were obtained by adding 1 cc.
of acetone containing the appropriate amount of a
mixture of DDT and C+4-DDT (10,000:1) to each beaker.
Observations were made at least twice daily for
the 12 day experimental period. One animal from each
beaker was analyzed for amount of DDT taken up
after the 12 days. The C+-DDT was extracted 3 times
with 10 mls. petroleum ether from a 50% glacial
acetic:50% perchloric acid digest of the animal.
The extract was evaporated to approximately 1 ml..
mixed with 10 mls. of toluene scintillation fluid and
counted using a liquid scintillation counter (NuclearÂ¬
Chicago, Unilux II). The remaining animals were
saved for neurophysiological analysis.
Refer to Table I for the results of these studies.
