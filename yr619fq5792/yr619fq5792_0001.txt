Abstract
Large motor aberrations were observed in the sand
crab, Emerita analoga, allowed to concentrate DDT
from seawater to 1.4 ppm. This is close to some
levels found in the field.
In recordings made from a nerve innervating the
abdominal flexor muscles, 1 ppm DDT in the bathing
medium greatly increases spontaneous neuronal
bursting, length of tactually stimulated bursts and
frequency of firing of the larger motor neurons.
These effects appear cumulative and irreversible.
Animals bathed in 100 ppb DDT and animals with
1.4 ppm DPT taken up over 12 days showed lesser but
similar neurophysiological effects. Behavioral
effects at concentrations found in the natural
environment is deemed possible.
