Neurons 1 and 2 seem to be inhibited (these are
normally firing all the time) while one of the
larger neurons, believed to be spike 4, is firing.
This is shown in figures 3E and 4E.
Short bursts of activity could be elicited
from the nerve, ng, by tactile stimulation of either
the head region (particularly the antennae) or the
telson region. Tactile stimulation to the telson
still gave bursting after the nerve cord was cut
anterior to the third ganglion. A cut was then made
just below the third ganglion and bursting could no
longer be elicited by telson stimulation. In
another preparation when the nerve cord was cut
just below ny, anterior to the fourth ganglion,
tactile stimulation to the head region still elicited
bursts. I concluded that the nerve ny is associated
primarily with cells in the third abdominal ganglion.
Telson stimulation, however, may not elicit all 6
spikes, leaving the possibility that some of these
motor neurons may come directly from higher centers
(i.e. more anterior). Also, all 6 neurons may not
have been recorded in these animals so a small number
of the cells could come from the fourth ganglion.
Spiking activity in the nerve, ng, usually
exhibits "size princinle" (2); the smaller spikes
(smaller motorneurons) firing much more often while
the larger spikes are harder to elicit and occur near
