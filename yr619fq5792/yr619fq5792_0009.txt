may be present; spikes 1 and 2 seem to be inhibited
while neuron 4 is firing. Bursting activity
occuring during tactile stimulation of the head region
or telson seems associated with cells in the third
abdominal ganglion. "Size principle" was demonstrated
and discussed.
Gross motor effects were observed in animals
allowed to absorb DDT from seawater. Animals whose
whole body concentrations reached 1.4 ppm DDT were
seen to exhibit large motor effects yet not die within
12 days. This level is close to that reported for
some Emerita in the natural environment.
Neurophysiological recordings show that 1 ppm DDT
in the bathing medium of a dissection greatly increases
(1) amount of spontaneous bursting (2) length of
tactually stimulated bursts and (3) the frequency of
firing of the larger motorneurons. These effects
seemed to increase with exposure to DDT and could not
be reversed. Lower concentrations (100 ppb) and
animals which had taken up DDT in the behavioral
studies showed lesser but similar effects; the
continuance of tactually elicited bursts and the
frequency increase in the large neuron's firing were
the most prominent results. The increased activity
generally seemed to leave coordination between spikes
unchanged. The possibility of behavioral effects
at concentrations found in the natural environment
