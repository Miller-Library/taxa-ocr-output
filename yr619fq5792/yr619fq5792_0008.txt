second concentration may actually be more meaningful
since somewhat similar effects to those of DDT have
been reported for the metabolite DDD (3).)
The neurophysiological results show that 1 ppm
DDT increases neuronal discharge in at least na.
This is consistent with the present theory on the
mechanism of DDT action which proposes that the DDT
treated membrane remains depolarized for a longer
than normal time after a spike has fired (4; 5; 6;
7; 8; 9). The effect on tactually stimulated bursts
and the ability of the larger neurons (particularly
6) to fire seem the more sensitive indications of
change; these are most clearly seen in the lower
concentration (100 ppb) and uptake (1.4 ppm whole
animal concentration) preparations.
Finally, if Davis' concept that recruitment of
larger motorneurons results in more forceful movements (2)
applies here then behavioral aberrancies might be
expected at low concentrations wherein neurons 5 and
6 fire at rates higher than controls.
Summary
The nerve of the sand crab, Emerita analoga, which
leaves the main nerve cord between the third and fourth
abdominal ganglia innervates what appears to be the
fast flexor muscles of the fourth abdominal segment.
Six motor axons have been identified, though a seventh
