A Comparative Study of Lethal Temperatures
in the Limpets Acmaea scabra and Acmaca digitalis

INTRODUCTION
The importance of temperature as a limiting factor for the gco-
graphical distribution of intertidal animals is generally recog-
nized (Moorc, 1958). Many studies have been conducted in an effort
to correlate the distribution of some intertidal organisms with
among them
either air or sea temperature,y those of Hutchins (1947).
Southward (1950), and Southward and Crisp (1954). Segal (1956, 1961.
1962) has indicated that there is a difference between the highest and lowes
intertidal members of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea limatula : Exact'>Acmaea limatula</span> Carpenter, 1864,and tha lem-
att with respect to such body functions as heart rate and
oxygen consumption. Intraspecific differences in these processes
have also been detected in animals from different latitudes. Segal
has further demonstrated that these differences are a possible effect
of temperature and that acciimation of the processes to different
tidal levels takes place.
Studies have also been conducted to determinc the lethal temp-

and Hayeo, ayr However these investigations have
not dealt satisfactorily with intraspecific variation or niche
difference. For instance, there may be a difference between lethal
temperatures of members of a single species from the extreme boundaries
ofits vertical intertidal distribution at a single latitude.

There may also be differences between different species which are
found at the same intertidal levels.
This study was undertaken in an attempt to answer threc main
questions: 1) Is there a difference in lethal temperatures of
and hodr stae
animals of the same species,taken from different tidal levels?
2) Is there a difference between lethal temperatures of two species
occupying the same intertidal levels? 3) How does an organism's
lethal temperature relate to the temperature of its microhabitat?
The organisms used in this study, the limpets Acmaea digitalis
Eschscholtz, 1833, and Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1846), are ideal for
rer wa
answering these question, since they occupy the same range in the
intertidal zone (-2 to +10 feet) along the central California coast
(Test, 1945).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The members of cach species were collected from areas visibly
dominated by one or the other (at Point Pinos and Mussel Point on
the Monterey Peninsula) in order that the results gained by lab-
oratory experiments would be as representative as possible of the
normal population.
For the purposes of testing intraspecific differencesiinilethal

animals were taken from the extreme upper (above +7.0 feet) and
lower (below +4.5 fect) limits of the species in that area, and

lected animals were placed in running sea water at approximately
15°C. in the laboratory and used within 24 hours.
Two types of laboratory experiments were conducted to determine
lethal temperatures. The first type was run with the animals sub-

allowed to  equilibrate, The temperature was then raised
at a rate of fC. per 5 minutes, to allow for complete equilibration
of theeinternal and external temperatures of the animals (Southward,
1958). Fifteen high, mid, and low members of each species were
removed at l intervals, at the indicated temperatures and replaced
in running sea water at 15°C. The animals were allowed to recover
for 6-12 hours and checked for survival by pricking the mantle fold
with a needle. If no response was elicited, the animal was considered
dead.
The second type of experiment tested the animals' abilities to
survive prolonged exposure to higher than normal temperatures in air,
Members of each specics from each of the three intertidal levels

chloride and potassium nitrate, resulting in a relative humidity, as

was raised at the previously mentioned rate until the desired temp-
erature was reached. The animals were held at this temperature
(#0.3), with 15 animals from each species and each intertidal level
being removed a 5, 10, and 15 hours. Trials were run at 29, 31.5.
and 34. After each time period the removed animals were replaced
in running sea water at 15°C., and tested as above after 6-12 hours.
Field temperatures encountered by the two species were taken
eween
on several days-at 12-4:0Opmat Mussel Point. Temperatures were
taken with a portable thermistor (model 43TD Yellow Springs Tele-
Thermometer). Five readings were recorded: 1) air temperature
2-3cm. above the animal, 2) rock temperature next to the limpet,
3) the temperature on the surface of the animal's, shelle4) the temper-
ature beneath the animal's foot, and 5) the temperature within the
limpet's mantle cavity. The air, rock, and shell temperatures were
taken with a banjo-type probe, model 409, which was kept shaded to
prevent heating by direct sunlight. The foot and mantle cavity
temperatures were taken with a 716 inch flexible probe, model 402.
The foot and mantle cavity temperatures were taken in situ. Bach
animal was lifted from the rock, the probe was placed under the
foot or in the mantle cavity, and the animal returned to the spot
from which it was taken. The limpet was then held in place with the
blade of a knife and the temperature read-out recorded.

data show a marked tendency for the low intertidal group to be
smaller than the high intertidal group.

the actual temperature of the limpet (mantle cavity temperature) is
higher than the microhabitat temperatures. No significant temper-
aturc differences of any of the measured variables were found
between the upper and lower areas(the temperatures were taken from
+3 to 47 feet).

DISCUSSION
In all experiments Acmaca scabra survived high temperatures,
in both air and water, better than did Acmaea digitalis. These
differences betwcen the two species correlates with the higher mean
microhabitat temperatures which were found. Haven (1964) has observed
that A. scabra is seen in greatest abundance on surfaces which are
more horizöntal than the areas of highest A. digitalis concentration.
This also correlates well with the observed lethal temperatures,
since A. scabra would therefore receiw more and stronger sunlight
than would A. digitalis.
The observed intraspecific differences in ability to survive
high temperatures possibly result from temperature acclimation.
Thus, even though the high and low members within each species
experience much the same temperatures, the higher members would
experience any high temperatures for longer periods of time than
their lower counterparts. An alternative explanation, not involving
temperature acclimation, is that the greater resistance of the higher
andsor a90.
forms is a consequence of their greater size, This is suggested by
the results in Table 1, showing a continuum in size, with higher.
animals having larger shells than lower animals, and the work
of Frank (1965), which showed that A. digitalis move higher
in the intertidal zone with age. However, these results do
not establish a causal relationship between size and ability
to withstand high temperatures, and further research ig
pLanned.
The intraspecific differences in ability to survive high temp-
eratures were much less clear in the prolonged temperaturc trials.

and
This was especially evident with Acmaca digitalisThie can
possibly be traced to the fact that even though the A. digitalis
population presents a size continuum(with the smallest animals
lowest in the intertidal zone and the largest animals highest)
this species is probably more mobile than Acmaea scabra. This
results in part from the greater percentage of homing behavior
found in A. scabra than in A. digitalis (Haven, 1964; Jessee, 1966;
Miller, 1966). It can be expected thereforc, that the effects of
acclimation would be more clearly defined in a population of ani-
mals which remain in rather fixed positions. This agrees with the
greater intraspecifec differences in survival at high temperaturess
seen in A. scabra.

SUMMARY
Lethal temperatures of the limpets Acmaca scabra and Acmaea
digitalis were studied. A. scabra was found to survive high temp-
eratures better than A. digitalis. These results correlate with
field studies which showed that A. scabra experiences higher micro-
habitat and body temperatures than does A. digitalis at similar temp-
eratures. It was also found that the internai temperatures of limpets
are consistently above the external surrounding temperatures.
Members of the species coming from the highest intertidal ranges
of the species were found to survive high temperatures better than
members from the lowest intertidal ranges of the species. These
intraspecific differences may be a result of acclimation to the
length of exposure to high environmental temperatures and there are
indications that the size and/or age of a limpet may have an effect
on its ability to survive high temperatures.
