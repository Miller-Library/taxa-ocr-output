SUMMARY
1. Suction recording electrodes were used to study
electrical activity in the radial nerve cord (RNC) of
the brittle star, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiopteris papillosa : Exact'>Ophiopteris papillosa.</span> In agreement
with results described by Tuft & Gilly (1984), the
fastest axons (class I) exhibited Cae independence.
Slower axons (class II) depend on Cae' for propagation.
2. Electrical activity can be recorded from the
hyponeural as well as the ectoneural surface of the RNC.
3. Simultaneous recordings from ectoneural and hyponeural
surfaces of a single segmented ganglion indicate that
the faster compound action potentials elicited by a brief
electrical shock are preferentially measured from the
hyponeural surface. This activity is probably caused by
class I axons. These axons are hypothesized to be
located most abundantly in the ectoneural tissue, near the
hyponeural border.
4. The axons responsible for the fast action potential
run along the RNC uninterrupted by chemical synapses for
at least 9 mm and possibly longer.
5. The electrical activity measured in response to
stimulation of the tip of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiopteris : Exact'>Ophiopteris</span> arm with the tube
foot from a predatory asteroid is very similar in
conduction velocity and lack of Cae' dependence to
that elicited by purely electrical stimulation.

These fibers are suggested to be involved in a sensory
pathway of some sort, rather than a motor output pathway,
INTRODUCTION
Knowledge of echinoderm nervous system function is
limited, largely due to small neural units and lack of
centralization. Furthermore, nervous system tissue is
virtuallyembedded in a complex connective tissue-ossicle
matrix. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiuroids : Exact'>Ophiuroids</span> provide a useful preparation for
studying general echinoderm nervous system due to the
presence of relatively large axons and quite accessible
nerves. Brehm (1977) has described axons in the radial
nerve cord (RNC) of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiotrix fragilis : Exact'>Ophiotrix fragilis</span> of a size much
larger than that seen in most echinoderms (78 um diameter
vs. K1 um). Cobb & Stubbs (1981) reported axons in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiura texturata : Exact'>Ophiura
texturata</span> to be up to 20 um in diameter.
Electrical activity evoked by brief electrical
shocks in the ophiuroid RNC consists of rapidly propagating
compound action potentials due to activation of "giant"
axons (Brehm, 1977). This activity is especially apparent
because it has a low threshold and yields discrete
spike-like voltages.
Little has been done to study the electrophysiological
characteristics of the ophiuroid nervous system. In
Yee - 4
Ophiopteris papillosa two functionally distinct classes
of axons have been previously described (Tuft & Gilly, 1984).
Class I axons, believed to be the largest in the RNC, have
a low threshold and conduction velocity of over 1.00 m/s
at 1900. These axons depend on Na for propagation and do
not appear to require Ca2'. Class II axons were characterized
by a conduction velocity of 0.55 m/s and no Na' requirement.
A requirement for Ca2t for propagation was suggested by
these authors.
The radial nerve cord of Ophiopteris papillosa
consists of a chain of segmental ganglionic swellings
running from the oral disc to the tip of the arm.
Pentreath and Cottrell (1971) describe the nerve cord
of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiothrix fragilis : Exact'>Ophiothrix fragilis,</span> a similar ophiuroid. "It
is generally accepted that both the ganglia and their
connecting nerves consist of two superimposed systems,
a thick ventral ectoneural, and a thin dorsal hyponeural
system (Hyman, 1955). The former is presumed sensory
and motor, the latter purely motor. Branches from the
ecctoneural tissue serve the podia and spines, while
branches from the hyponeural tissue supply the interver-
tebral muscles." It is assumed that the neuroanatomy of
Ophiopteris papillosa is similar to that described for

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimins of Ophiopteris papillosa were collected
subtidally using SCUBA from the Monterey Bay near
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, Ca. Animals
were maintained in holding tanks in running natural
sea water (NSW) at 1500.
In order to expose the radial nerve cord, an animal
was turned upside-down and placed in a sylgard floored
dish. The oral disc and arms of the animal were restrained
using <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>U-shaped pins.</span> Two parallel cuts were made on the
ventral plates (ossicles), close to the base of the tube
feet. Then, the layer of material immediately beneath
the ossicle was cut using a scaple, and the ossicles
were individually plucked off of the arm. Unless otherwise
specified, all dissections were carried out in natural
sea water.
A bipolar stimulating electrode made of fine Pt
wires was painted with nail polish to expose only the
very tips of the wires. The electrode was placed on
top of the RNC, generally straddling a ganglionic
swelling. Tektronix Type 162 Waveform Generator and
Type 161 Pulse Generator were used to produce the
rectangular pulses (.5- 2 msec duration) used to
stimulate the RNC.
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Recording electrodes</span> were made from a 1 ml disposable
syringe fitted with a tip of Intramedic Polyethylene tubing
Yee - 6
(47420) pulled to a final diameter of 150 - 200 microns
using the heat of a soldering iron. The electrode measured
the difference in voltage sensed between two Ag: AgCl
wires, one inside the barrel of the syringe, and the
other wrapped around the polyethylene tip. The signal
recorded from the RNC was amplified through a Tektronix
Type 122 Low Level Pre-Amp with low/hi pass filters set
at 1 KHz/ 8Hz. Records were photographed off a
Tektronix 5111 storage oscilloscope.
Electrical activity of both ectoneural and hyponeural
portions of the RNC was measured. In all cases "windows"
of length 1-2 cm were made by removing ventral plates to
expose a segment of the RNC. Unless otherwise indicated,
the stimulating electrode and recording electrode were
positioned in the same "window" over a distance varying
from 4 - 20 mm. Conduction velocity in this report is
defined as the interelectrode distance divided by the
latency from the onset of the stimulus pulse to the
peak of the recorded spike in question.
For ectoneural recording the electrode was positioned
over a ganglionic swelling and slight suction applied,
until spontaneous activity of the RNC appeared. When
hyponeural activity alone was recorded, the RNC was
severed in a region close to the oral disc. Ectoneural
nerve roots leading laterally to the podia and spines
were then gently cut away over a length and the RNC was
Yee - 7
then lifted sightly and folded over itself, thereby
exposing the hyponeural surface. The recording electrode
was then again positioned over a ganglionic swelling and
recordings made as previously described.
For simultaneous recordings from ectoneural and
hyponeural surfaces, the RNC was exposed as for hyponeural
recording, but a suction electrode was first attached to
the ectoneural surface of a selected ganglion, and the
nerve was lifted up a few mm by this attachment. Another
electrode was then applied to the exposed hyponeural
ganglion surface.
Experiments were also carried out stimulating Ophiopteris
RNC with a tube foot of <span style='background-color:grey' title='Pycnopodia helianthoides : Fuzzy'>Pyonopodia helianthoides,</span> a
predatory asteroid. A freshly procured tube foot was placed
on the end of a hypodermic needle attached to the movable
breaker of a d.c. relay. A toggle switch simultaneously
activated the relay which moved the tube foot several
millimeters to hit the ophiuroid arm and triggered a
sweep on the storage oscilloscope allowing the accompanying
electrical activity of the RNC to be recorded. For these
experiments, two "windows" were prepared to expose the RNC.
The recording electrode was placed in the window closer
to the oral disc; the stimulating electrode was placed in
a window near the tip of the arm. Electrical stimuli were
delivered until activity of class I axons was reliably
recorded. Then, tubefoot stimulation was carried out in
Yee - 8
order to compare the activity evoked by the two methods
of stimulation.
All experiments were conducted in NSW unless otherwise
indicated. Ca“-free artificial sea water (ASW) contained
470mM Nacl, 10mM KC1, 60mM MgC12, 10 mM TRIS, 10mM EGTA.
Final pH was adjusted to 7.8 and osmolality approximately
980 osmol/Kg H20.
In order to change the bathing medium during an
experiment without disrupting the electrode attachment,
solution in the chamber was first slowly drained. The
new solution was then carefully added to the dish,
covering the entire animal.
All experiments were conducted at 12.5-1600.
RESULTS
Electrical activity very similar to the multi-component
action potentials described by Brehm (1977) and Tuft &
Gilly (1984) was also recorded in this study. Figure
1A shows a record of presumably class I axon activity
with a conduction velocity of about 0.4 m/s at 1300.
Class II activity is also seen at a conduction velocity of
0.19 m/sec.
The characteristic conduction velocity of class I
axons as measured by Tuft & Gilly (1984) was 1.39 m/s
(+ .14 SD) at 19°0. The characteristic conduction
Yee - 9
velocity of the first detectable sign of electrical activity
in this study at 14-14.500 was 0.53 m/s (+.20 SD, N - 23)
for seven arms. This value is similar to the 0.38 m/s
average given by Brehm (1977) for another species of
ophiuroid at 15°0. It is assumed that this fast activity
is due to action potentials in the class I axons.
SENSITIVITIES OF CLASS I & CLASS II AXONS TO CA REMOVAL.
Removal of Cae from the bathing medium surrounding
the ophiuroid did not affect the activity of class I axons
but eliminated activity of class II axons. Figure 1B
shows the activity of class I axons after an animal
had been dissected in Ca2t-free ASW and the nerve bathed in
the medium for a total of 49 minutes. Activity with a
conduction velocity of.44 m/s is clearly present.
Following restoration of NSW, class I activity persists,
and class II axons activity returns (Fig. 1A).
In Ca2'-free ASW bathing media, the earliest detectable
electrical activity exhibits a characteristic conduction
velocity of 0.43 m/s (+.02 SD. N=8) for two different
arms. This value is close to that cited above for
natural sea water. This rapidly propagating activity is
therefore identified with class I axons.
COMPARISON OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY RECORDED FROM
ECTONEURAL VS. HYPONEURAL SURFACES.
Pentreath and Cottrell (1971) report an anatomical and
functional separation of the RNC of Ophiotrix fragilis into
hyponeural and ectoneural tissue. Measurements from
Yee - 10
the hyponeural side of the RNC in response to electrical
stimulation resulted in reproducible electrical activity
similar to that recorded from the ectoneural surface.
The characteristic conduction velocity for all ectoneural
recordings made was 0.53 m/s (+.20 SD, N-23from 7 arms)
and for hyponeural 0.56 m/s (+.06 SD, N=12 from 3 arms).
When both ectoneural and hyponeural activity were
recorded simultaneously from the same ganglion, the first
sign of electrical activity inevitably appeared first in
the hyponeural recording (See Fig. 2). In no case did
simultaneously recorded ectoneural and hyponeural activity
show a striking correspondence in individual spikes.
Thus, each electrode must record from alimited volume of
nerve near its tip. The exact location of active units
is not certain however, and this will be discussed later.
COMPARISON OF ELECTRICAL STIMULUS VS. CHEMO/TACTILE STIMULUS.
Behavioral response corresponding to electrical activty
of the RNC of Ophiopteris papillosa have not been studied.
Attempts in the present experiments to correlate any form
of motor output with electrical shocks exciting RNC activity
were not successful. Tubefoot retraction occasionally could
be stimulated and mucous secretion seemed to increase with
stimulation, but activation of the vertebral muscles which
move the arm could not be produced.
In light of these negative results, we sought a more
physiological method of stimulating class I axons in the
RNC in order to compare the associated electrical response
Yee - 11
with those due to the electrical stimulation.
Stimulating the tip of Ophiopteris arm with a tube-
foot of the predatory asteroid <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pycnopodia helianthoides : Exact'>Pycnopodia helianthoides</span>
evokes a vigorous behavioral escape responseof the arm
(Burkhart, 1984). Electrical recordings made from the
moment of chemotactile (i.e. with a tubefoot) or electrical
stimulation clearly both show fast compound action potentials
of similar amplitude, wave form and conduction velocity,
An example of recordings made sequentially from the same
site of both means of stimulation are shown in Fig. 3.
While an exact correspondence in the two records
does not exist, class I - like activity is present in both,
For this reason, we hypothesize the involvement of class
I axons along the sensory pathway activated by the tubefoot
simulus. Furthermore, the activity elicited by the tubefoot
shows the same sort of Cae independence characteristic of
class I axons (Burkhart, 1984).
DIS
SCUSSTON
Results described in this paper confirm and extend
findings on Ophiopteris papillosa (Tuft & Gilly, 1984)
and adds new information of the function of the giant
axons in ophiuroids.
Are chemical synapses involved in class I axon transmission?
Brehm (1977 has suggested an average length of 4.2 cm
for axons in Ophiotrix which displayed a conduction
Yee - 12
velocity of 0.38 m/s. This conclusion was based upon the
following of the largest spikes of a train along the RNC.
Tuft & Gilly (1984) felt that synapses were not involved
in class I axon transmission in Ophiopteris over a distance
of at least 1.5 cm based on the very rapid conduction velocity
and tentative lack of Cae' dependence for transmission.
In this study, we hypothesize a non-interrupted length
of at least 1 cm for class I axons based upon studies
of Cae independence. Class I fibers maintained their
electrical activity over a recording distance of 1 cm in
Ca°"-free ASW indicating that in this length, the axons
are not interrupted by chemical synapses. Characterization
of class II axons based upon 0 Cae' studies are not
as clear. Because the activity of class II axons is eliminated
by the removal of Ca2', it is possible that they are
interrupted more often by chemical synapses, perhaps in
every segmental ganglion as proposed by Cobb & Stubbs (1981).
Whether or not electrical synapses are involved in any way
in transmission for either axonal type remains unknown, but
there would seem to be no reason for requiring this.
Yee - 13
Are the most rapidly conducting class I axons ectoneural?
In this study, electrical activity measured from the
hyponeural surface of the RNC was recorded. In fact,
the most rapidly propagating axons were preferentially
seen when recording from the hyponeural surface. There
is some question, therefore as to the anatomical location
of the large axons underlying these rapid action potentials.
Although a suction electrode as used in the present
experiments must sample activity in a prescribed volume
of RNC near its tip, the extent of that volume relative
to the diameter of the RNC is not certain. Thus, while
an electrode may be positioned on the hyponeural surface,
recordings made there need not reflect only hyponeural
activity. It is believed that the fastest phase of the
compound action potential seen by the hyponeural electrode
is actually due to class 1 axons as described by Tuft &
Gilly (1984) which may be located in the ectoneural
portion of the RNC as they proposed.
One argument behind this idea involves the geometry
of the RNC and the position of the suction recording
electrode. We assume in this study that the neuro-
anatomy of Ophiopteris is similar in nature to that
of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiothrix : Exact'>Ophiothrix</span> described by Pentreath & Cottrell (1971).
Thus, the hyponeural tissue is a thin layer lying dorsally
to the ectoneural tissue. The most pronounced separation
between the two tissues occurs in the ganglionic
Yee - 14
swelling where a thin layer of collagen separates hyponeural
from ectoneural tissue. Considerable intermingling of the tissues
occurs in interganglionic regions (See Fig. 1, Fig. 2 Pentreath
& Cottrell, 1971).
Due to the relatively large tip diameter of the suction
recording electrode (150 - 250 u) in comparison to that of the
RNC itself (150u for hyponeural, 625 u for ectoneural in a
ganglionic region), the electrically visible volume of nerve
over which a seal has been placed hyponeurally probably contains
both hyponeural and ectoneural tissue. As such, the neural
activity measured by an electrode positioned on the hyponeural
surface is likely to contain activity of both hyponeural and
ectoneural axons.
A second argument for assigning an ectoneural location to
the fastest class 1 axons is based on a consideration of the
functional aspects of the two tissues. The hyponeural layer of
the RNC is reported by Pentreath & Cottrell (1971) to be of
purely motor function. In the ganglionic regions, hyponeural
motor neurons send out large diameter (up to 12 u) processes of :
about 300 u length to directly inervate the intervertebral muscles,
and are thus responsible for the arm flexing by the ophiuroid. These
large motor axons exit the ganglion dorsally through holes in the
ossicles.
Despite the large size of these axons, stimulation of the RNC
of Ophiopteris with electrical shocks that excited class I axons
did not elicit any obvious motor response of the intervertebral muscles.
This suggests that the fast electrical activity recorded by the
Yee - 15
the hyponeural electrode is not directly related to motor
function. Moreover, the fastest compound action potentials
recorded from the hyponeural side of the RNC display Cae
independence, characteristic of class I axons seen with an
ectoneural electrode. No hyponeural pathway is known
from anatomical studies to extend for distances greater
than one segmented region, but the published account of
this is somewhat vague (Pentreath & Cottrell, 1971).
While one could hypothesize Cae-independent giant
hyponeural axons which extend for distances of lcm or
more, or that some of the largest class I axons are actually
hyponeural fibers, such speculation does not seem necessary.
Rather, we propose that the fastest electrical activity
measured by an electrode on the hyponeural surface of the
RNC is actually due to the largest ectoneural class I axons,
which run along the dorsal surface of ectoneural tissue
and are in close proximity to the hyponeural region (See
Fig. 4).
Anatomical evidence consistant with this proposal
exists. Large axons (up to 8 u) in the RNC of Ophiothrix
are described by Brehm (1977) using electron microscopy
techniques. These axons are scattered deep within the
extoneural portion of the RNC and are not found in the
hyponeural nerve cord.
Furthermore, Pentreath & Cottrell (See their Fig. 7,
1971) indicate that the largest axons in the ectoneural
tissue of Ophiotrix do, in fact, lie just ventrally to
the hyponeural tissue as proposed here. These authors
Yee - 16
reported that those axons were actually hyponeural in
origin, but their reasons for stating this are unclear and
convincing evidence is not presented.
If the fastest of the class I fibers are indeed
localized along the dorsal edge of the RNC near the
ectoneural/hyponeural boundary, the significance of such
close proximity must be questioned. Perhaps these axons
are in some way involved in communication between the
two tissues. As discussed above, this communication would
not seem to be a direct activation pathway to the motoneurons
innervating the intervertebral muscles.
Are Class I Axons Involved In Sensory Integration?
Finally in this study, we were concerned with discerning
the function of the class I axons. Since no apparent
motor output accompanied electrical stimulation, it was
hypothesized that the very fast spikes caused by class I
axons might serve more of a sensory function. This idea
is supported by comparison of electrical stimulation and
stimulation of the RNC by a tubefoot of Pycnopodia
helianthoides. Ophiopteris papillosa exhibits an
escape respons from Pynopodia characterized by a
stereotypic arm-jerk followed by movement of the body
away from the stimulus (Burkhart, 1984). Electrical
activity in the RNC caused by the tubefoot stimulus
greatly precedes the motor responses and propagates at
at a velocity characteristic of class I axons. It is
O
Yee - 17
unlikely, therefore, that the very fast spikes initially
recorded represent motor output. What role they play in
integrating sensory information remains to be elucidated.
