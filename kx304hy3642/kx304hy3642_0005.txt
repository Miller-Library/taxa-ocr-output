Physiology of infected Batallaria
J. Miller Pg 6
Respiration Rate
The average respiration rate of infected snails does
not differ significantly from that of uninfected snails
(Table II). In both populations there was great variation
in individual respiration rates ranging from 24.96 to 122.85
ul O, consumed per gram of snail per hour. In the unin-
fected snails and from 38.3 to 121.32 ul 0Â» consumed per gram
of snail per hour in the infected snails.
Rate of Ulva sp. Consumption
Infected snails had a greater intake of Ulva than unin-
fected snails (p(.06) (Table III).
Microscopic Observations of Gonad
No eggs or sperm were observed in any of the sections
of heavily infected snails. Cercaria occupied the gonadal
tissue.
DISCUS!
SION
Infection by larval trematodes greatly affects the
physiology of Batallaria attramentaria, as shown by the
lowered resistance to thermal stress, increased food intake,
and lack of gametes in the infected snails. These results
concur with those reported by Vernberg and Vernberg (1962)
