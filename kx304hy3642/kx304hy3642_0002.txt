Physiology of infected Batallaria
INTRODUCTION
Because the host-parasite relationship between molluscs
and helminths is longstanding and widespread, (Lauckner, 1980)
ecological and physiological studies of the mollusc must con-
sider the effects of this parasitism on the host. Some of
these effects include cessation of sperm and egg production
(Cheng et al., 1965), alterations of digestive-enzyme activity
(Marshall et. al., 1974), reduced locomotor activity (Stam-
baugh and McDermot, 1969; Tallmark and Narrgren, 1976).
Gigantism (Rothschild, 1941), altered migratory habits
(Williams and Ellis, 1975), increased food consumption
(Wesenberg-Lund, 1934), lowered thermal resistance (Vernberg
and Vernberg, 1963) and altered respiration rates (Becker,
1964; Von Brand, 1947; and Vernberg and Vernberg, 1967) have
also been reported.
With future ecological studies in mind, this study was
undertaken to find out the effects of larval trematode in-
fection on the thermal resistance, respiration rate, rate of
Ulva sp. consumption, and gamete production of the marine mud-
flat snail Batallaria attramentaria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
After a preliminary survey of larval trematode infection
levels in late April, 1980, 2.2 to 2.5 cm in length Batallaria
attramentaria were collected from Bennett's Slough, Monterey Bay,
