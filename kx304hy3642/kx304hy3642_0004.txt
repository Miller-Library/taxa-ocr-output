Physiology of infected Batallaria
J. Miller Pg 5
Effects of parasitism on food consumption were determined
by first cutting and weighing 6 cm x 6 cm pieces of Ulva sp.
collected from Bennett's slough. One snail, one square of
Ulva, and 40 ml of sea water were placed in each of 20, 9 cm
x 14 cm, disposable petri dishes. The petri dishes were kept
out of direct sunlight in 1 cm deep running sea water. After
10 days the Ulva was weighed and checked for infection.
Microscopic observations of the snail gonads were done
by preparing thin sections of 3 infected and 3 uninfected
snails. Tissues were fixed in a 5% glutaraldehyde, 9% formal-
dehyde solution, embedded in JB-4 plastic, cut into 2 u thick
sections and stained by the Periodic Acid Schiff method.
RESULTS
Thermal Resistance
The effects of larval trematode infection on Batallaria
attramentaria's resistance to thermal stress is shown in
Table I. No significant mortality differences were observed
at 39°C, 43°C, and 49°C. At 46°0 differences in survival
rates were significant at 1 hr (17p2.05) and at 14 hrs (p£.05).
After 2 hours at 46 C no differences in survival could be
detected. With a 3°0 increase, no snails of either popula-
tion survived a 30 minute exposure to 49' C.
