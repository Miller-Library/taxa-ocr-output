Physiology of infected Batallaria

and Tallmark and Norrgren (1976) who found thermal resis-
tance to be less in other species of parasitized snails.
Wesenburg-Lund (1947) has previously shown that infected
snails ingest more food and James (1965) has reported
cessation of egg and sperm production in Littorina saxatilis.
The effect of parasitism on respiration still remains
unanswered. Similar average respiration rates for infected
and uninfected Batallaria at 16°0 may indicate that the
metabolic activity of the larval thermatode is similar to that
of the host tissue. With such a wide range of individual
rates, however, factors other than just parasitism must be
affecting respiration rates. Vernberg and Vernberg (1963)
reported differences in respiration rates of parasitized
and nonparasitized snails only at temperature extremes of
10°0 and 35°C; Van Brand and Files (1947) found no difference
in respiration rates at 30°0; and Beeker (1964) reported a
lower respiration rate for infected snails at 25°0.
Lower heat resistance, greater intake of food, and
absence of gametes in infected snails reduce their resistance
to environmental stress. The snail's individual reduced
fitness might not be noticeable under slough conditions,
but the fitness of the population may be reduced due to
parasitic castration. Whitlatch (1974) has reported estimates
for population sizes of Batallaria with no mention of the
