Physiology of infected Batallaria
California, in early May, 1980. Forty-seven per cent of the
snails within this population were parasitized with only one
undescribed cercaria. The snails were brought into the labo-
ratory and held in an aquarium containing mud and Ulva sp.
from the slough.
Effects of larval trematode infection on the thermal
resistance of Batallaria attramentaria were determined by
placing snails in individual 50 ml Erlenmyer flasks, which
contained 4 paper towel discs, moistened with 2 ml of sea
water. Each flask was stoppered with cotton and immersed
immediately in a temperature controlled water bath. Snail
viability was assayed by placing them, operculum side up,
into separate 30 ml beakers, covering them with sea water.
If the snail righted itself (i.e. operculum down) within
24 hours it was considered alive. Usually, both infected
and uninfected snails right themselves within a few hours
and often crawl out of the beakers. Then each snail was
dissected and checked for infection.
Respiration rates of the snails were measured with a
Gilson Differential Respirometer (Gilson Medical Electronics,
Middleton, WI.) at a shaking speed of 5 and a temperature of
1690. One snail was placed in each reaction vessel and just
covered with sea water. One half ml of 30% KOH was added to
the reaction vessel side arm to absorb C0, produced by the
snail. After rates were recorded, each snail was removed from
its shell, weighed, and checked for infection.
