Physiology of infected Batallaria
J. Miller Pg 2
ABSTRACT: The effects of larval trematode infection on the
thermal resistance, respiration rate, rate of Ulva sp. con-
sumption and gamete production of Batallaria attramentaria
were determined. Nonparasitized snails showed a greater
survival rate at 46°0 for 1 hour (.1)p2.05) and at 46°0 for
1 hours (p£.05). The average respiration rates of infected
and noninfected snails did not differ significantly. In-
dividual respiration rates varied widely in both parasitized
and nonparasitized snails. Infected snails consumed more
Ulva sp. than uninfected snails (pK.06). No eggs or sperm
were observed in heavily infected snails.
