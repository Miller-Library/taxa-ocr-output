Predators of the High Intertidal Harpacticoid Copepod
Tigriopus californicus
Tigriopus californicus, a harpacticoid oopepod, occurs in great numbers
in high rocky tide pools along the Pacific coast from Vancouver Island, British
Columbia, to Baja California (Vittor, 1971). Predation on Tigriopus has not
been previously studied, and as of this date no important predators are known
(Vittor, 1971). The present paper presents an investigation of some possible
predators of Tigriopus.
A preliminary survey of tide pools in the vicinity of the Hopkins Marine
Station of Stanford University at Pacific Grove, California and Natural Bridges
State Park, Santa Cruz, California, beginning in the highest pools and working
down to the lower pools, revealed the following list of possible predators: the
waterboatman Trichocorixia sp. (Insecta, Hemiptera), the crab Pachygrapsus
crassipes, the hermit crab Pagurus samuelis, the barnacle Balanus glandula,
Gammarid amphipods, isopods, the bivalve Mytilus californianus, the sea
anemone Anthopleura elegatissima, the cottid fish Clinocottus analis, and
the shrimp Heptacarpus paludicola.
Materials and Methods
Possible predators and Tigriopus were collected in April and May, 1977,
at Mussel Point, Point Pinos, and Asilomar State Beach, Pacific Grove, Califor-
nia, and maintained in either running sea water or in pans of standing sea water at
temperatures f approximately 15 to 22 90 until they were used in experiments.
Each potential predator species was tested to determine if it fed on
adult Tigriopus or its larvae. The basic experimental procedure for testing
predation on adult Tigriopus involved counting out 75 Tigriopus and placing
them in filtered sea water in a four inch fingerbowl. No gravid females were
used, so no hatching of larvae could occur. One to four
specimens of
