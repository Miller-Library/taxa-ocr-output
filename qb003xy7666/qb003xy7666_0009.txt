is not as common and if it is a predator, it is not as effective as the two
crabs. Anthopleura is an effective predator in the lower high tide pools which
receive some fresh sea water at high tides. Even lower in the intertidal
are the cottid fish; these and wave action could efficiently keep the Tigriopus
population to a minimum down here. Tigriopus were not normally found in the
same tide pools as the shrimps. However, heavy wave action could wash
Tigriopus down to the lower pools where the shrimp are found, allowing the
shrimp to act as occassional predator of Tigriopus.
