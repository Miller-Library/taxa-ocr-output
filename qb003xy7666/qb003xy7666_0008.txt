Heptacarpus paludicola
This carnivore (MacGinitie and MacGinitie, 1968) is found at the very
lower limit of Tigriopus's intertidal range. It is an active predator of
Tigriopus. The shrimp ate an average of 5.6% of the 75 Tigriopus in each
experiment (Table VIII). Heptacarpus uses its first and second chelipeds
to pick up Tigriopus. It holds the copepod with its legs and chelipeds while
it brings them to its mouth. The shrimp fecal pellets were red and contained
Tigriopus parts. The shrimp capture and eat the Tigriopus larvae using the
same method.
In early experiments it appeared that the smaller Heptacarpus ate more
Tigriopus than the larger ones. An experiment was set up to test the relation-
ship between shrimp size and its feeding rate on Tigriopus. Heptacarpus were
measured from the tip of the tail to the end of the rostrum and divided into
eight size classes over the body length range of 1.2 to 2.7 cm. One to
three predators were placed in a fingerbowl with 75 Tigriopus for 24 hours.
The smallest shrimp which had no experience catching Tigriopus ate more
copepods than the large inexperienced shrimp. However, the large shrimp which
had previously fed on Tigriopus ate more than most of the smaller inexperienced
shrimp (Figure I). The larger experienced shrimp also ate more than the
inexperienced shrimp of comparable size. It appears that the shrimp have the
ability to learn how to capture Tigriopus.
Summary
Under laboratory conditions the major predators of Tigriopus californicus,
in decreasing importance, are Clinocottus analis, Pachygrapsus crassipes,
Anthopleura elegatissima, Pagurus samuelis, Heptacarpus paludicola, and
Trichocorixia (Figure II). However, in natural situations Pachygrapsus and
Pagurus are probably the primary predators in the higher pools. Trichcorixia
