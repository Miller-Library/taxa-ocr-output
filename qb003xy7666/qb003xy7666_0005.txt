Tigriopus exoskeletons and fragments were found in the feces after the feeding
experiments. Pagurus was seen to pick Tigriopus off the bottom and the sides
of the fingerbowls with its left cheliped and then bring them to its mouth.
Here they are passed to the maxillipeds (Makaro, 1938). Pagurus is unable to
pick up the larvae with either cheliped; no larval exoskeleton fragments are
found in either the fecal pellets or the gut.
Tigriopus was observed to crawl all over Pagurus's body and sometimes
to go under the shell covering the gill chamber of the crab. In some cases
Tigriopus came out after the hermit crab was placed in 70% alcohol. Pagurus
could provide another means of transport for Tigriopus between tide pools, but
it does not move between high tide pools as much as Pachygrapsus.
Balanus glandula
This barnacle was collected on the shells of the mussel, Mytilus
californianus. Preliminary experiments showed that adult Tigriopus are too
large for the barnacle to catch with its branched cirri. The barnacles were
observed while in a fingerbowl with larvae, or with a mixture of larvae, the
diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornatum and Nitzschia longissima, and the flagellates,
Monochrysis lutheni and Isochrysis galbara. The phytoplankters were added to
stimulate filter feeding. The barnacles used in feeding experiments were
placed in fingerbowls after they had been out of water for 18 hours. A small
current was created with a pipette to induce them to feed. The cirri occassionÂ¬
ally caught a Tigriopus larvae and retracted into the shell. However, examin-
ation of the gut contents of barnacles exposed to copepod larvae did not reveal
any larval Tigriopus exoskeleton fragments. Possibly the larvae are rejected
at the mouth and released. At any rate, Balanus glandula is not a predator of
Tigriopus.
