the possible predator species being tested, starved for one to two days, were
added to each bowl. Observations were then made on the feeding methods of the
predators. At the end of 24 hours the predators were removed, the number of
living and dead Tigriopus remaining were counted, and the predator's gut contents
and fecal pellets were examined. The control for each set of experiments was a
fingerbowl with 75 Tigriopus in filtered sea water.
Tigriopus larvae were obtained by removing the egg sacs from gravid
females and allowing them to hatch in filtered sea water. Larvae were then
added to fingerbowls containing possible predators and observations were made
to determine the methods, if any, used to capture Tigriopus larvae. After 21
hours the gut contents and fecal pellets of the predators under study were
examined for Tigriopus fragments.
Results and Discussion
The control populations for the earlier experiments occassionally showed
an increase in number. This is due to the separation of copulating pairs which
in these earlier tests were counted as one individual, or possibly due to
inaccurate counting. The predators are considered below in the order of their
distribution in the intertidal zone, starting with those found in the highest
pools.
Trichocorixia
The waterboatman Trichocorixia was found in the flocculant detrital
material of the very high tide pools. In natural situations Trichocorixia
can cling to the bottom. To simulatethis natural condition I placed sterile
sand or cotton in the bottom of the fingerbowl; these materials could be
grasped by the corixids with the tarsal claws of their second legs (Pennak, 1953).
In all of the runs there was a small decline in the number of Tigriopus at the
end of the experiment (Table I). While under observation the corixids did not
