Gammarid Amphipods and Isopods
Preliminary observations showed that gammarid amphipods could be
predators of Tigriopus while the isopods are not. The amphipods and isopods
were too scarce in the high tide pools to use in feeding experiments, and are
not common enough to be major predators of Tigriopus.
Mytilus californianus
Preliminary experiments with Mytilus californianus revealed that it is
incapable of capturing adult Tigriopus (Table V). Mussels feed by a ciliary-
mucoid mechanism on the gills. The small frontal cilia on the gills move the
food particles and mucus down the lamelleof the gills bringing them to the
ciliated food grooves where both the food and the mucus are moved foward to
the palps for sorting. The palps reject the larger and heavier particles
which go to form pseudo-feces, while they accept the smaller or lighter partiÂ¬
cles and pass them to the mouth (Meglitsch, 1972).
Dissected living specimens of Mytilus with one valve removed were made
to determine if the gills could pick up and transport the larvae. The larvae
were pipetted directly onto the gill surface and observed to be transported
down the gill lamella to the food groove and then carried to the palps.
Following this, the same preparation of diatoms, flagellates and Tigriopus
larvae that was used to feed Balanus was presented to several healthy Mytilus
from 2.6 cm to 7.6 cm long. After the mussels had been allowed to feed for
at least 24 hours, their pseudo-feces, fecal pellets, and gut contents were
all examined for Tigriopus fragments. The pseudo-feces contained both live
Tigriopus larvae (struggling in the mucus), and some empty larval exoskeletons
which could have been molted exoskeletons. Larval exoskeletons were found in
the stomach and feces of Mytilus. When Mytilus was fed only Tigriopus larvae,
live larvae were found in the psuedo-feces and larval parts were found in the
