Anthopleura elegatissima
Anthopleura elegatissima captures Tigriopus with the nematocysts of
its tentacles. Once the Tigriopus are stung with the nematocysts, they stick
firmly to the tentacles or the tentacles wrap around them. The anemone slowly
transports the tentacles with the Tigriopus to the mouth where they are
ingested. Anthopleura consumed from 5 to 87% of the Tigriopus presented to it.
Tigriopus exoskeletons were found in the anemone feces.
Once Tigriopus became acclimated to the experimental environment with
the anemones, they generally avoided contact with the anemone tentacles; they
climbed around the base and the mouth areas of the anemones without being caught
by the tentacles. Their behavior suggested they were receiving chemical cues
from the anemone.
Anthopleura is able to catch larvae only if they are suspended in the
water column. The anemone itself does not create a current that suspends the
Tigriopus larvae in the water. The larvae are small and the anemone is not
able to sting and grasp them as well as they catch the adult Tigriopus.
Clinocottus analis
These cottid fish are voracious predators on Tigriopus. They fed rapidly
by sighting, moving towards, and snapping at Tigriopus as soon as the latter
were introduced to the fingerbowl. One fish ate all 75 Tigriopus within 3.75
hours (Table VII). The fish fecal pellets were red and contained Tigriopus
fragments. The fish do not actively seek Tigriopus larvae, but they eat them
if they are sucked in with the respiratory current. The fecal pellets contained
Tigriopus larval fragments at the end of the experiment.
