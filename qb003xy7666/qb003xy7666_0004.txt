Pachygrapsus crassipes
This crab is a common inhabitant of high tide pools and one of Tigriopus's
main predators. The crab ate from 2.6 to 36% of the adult Tigriopus presented
to it in feeding experiments (Table III). Fragments of adult copepod exoske¬
letons were found in the crab's feces several hours after the feeding experi¬
ment. Pachygrapsus uses its chelae to pick up Tigriopus and bring them to its
mouth. It also uses its chelae to scoop dead Tigriopus into its mouth. In its
natural environment Pachygrapsus is an omnivore (MacGinitie and MacGinitie,
1968). Its main food source is matted and encrusting algae which it scrapes
from rocks with its chelae; detrital material left by the receding tides, and
living intertidal organisms are its secondary food sources (Hiatt, 1948).
Pachygrapsus is able to ingest some Tigriopus larvae. Fragments of
larval exoskeletons were found in the feces. However, the larger the crab gets,
the more difficult it is for the crab to pick up the larvae. The reverse
respiratory current created by the bailers on the second maxillae and used to
clean the gills may carry the larvae directly to the mouth, allowing the crab
to feed without the use of its chelae.
After a feeding experiment the crabs involved were placed in 702
alcohol and their bodies and the alcohol searched for adult Tigriopus. Of
those copepods found, some appeared to have been inside the gill chamber,
current.
possibly sucked in with the respiratory/ Others were apparently clinging to
the hairs on the legs of the crabs. Pachygrapsus often visits high tide pools
and is responsible for transportingat least a few Tigriopus from one pool to
another.
Pagurus samuelis
This hermit crab is a scavenger of the high tide pools (MacGinitie and
MacGinitie, 1968) and is another predator of Tigriopus. (Table IV). Adult
