One of the most common red algae of the rocky shore
in California is <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Rhodoglossum affine : Exact'>Rhodoglossum affine.</span> Another red algal species,
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina papillata : Exact'>Gigartina papillata,</span> overlaps R. affine in its vertical range,
though it extends somewhat higher in the intertidal zone. To-
gether with other less abundant algae these species form a low
forest or turf in the midtide zone. The larger animals of this
zone are well known (e.g. Ricketts and Calvin, 1968), and the
community of smaller organisms inhabiting the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus : Exact'>Balanus</span> glandula-
Endocladia muricata zone in the upper intertidal has been studied
in some detail (Glynn, 1965). However, the mesobiota of the mid¬
tide algal forest has received little attention. This biota is
the subject of the present investigation.
Studies were directed toward determining whether the
mesofauna of these algae forms a relatively consistent associa¬
tion or community. Specifically, the following questions were
asked. In the zone occupied by the main population of Rhodo-
glossum affine, (1)What animals occur on R. affine, what forms
on <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>G. papillata,</span> and in what numbers are they present? (2) Does
the mesofauna of R. affine differ from that of G. papillata?
(3)Is there a significant difference in the nature and abundance
of mesobiota in samples taken from low, medium, and high regions
of the R. affine belt? (4) Considering R. affine and G. papillata
individually with regard to the composition and numbers of the
mesofauna: (a)Do differences exist between the mesofauna popu¬
lations in different areas, exposed to different conditions?

Allan Eisemann
and (b)Where differences exist, what factors are correlated with
these differences?
All studies were carried out in April and May, 1979, on
and about Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, within the
research reservation around the Hopkins Marine Station. Three
sampling areas were chosen, each with a good population of R.
affine but each exposed to a different degree of wave action
(figure 1). Area A is the least protected, as it faces the open
surf. Area C, protected by the rocky islets to the north, re-
ceived a moderate degree of wave action. Area B, located on the
lee side of a small offshore island, received virtually no wave
action. Degree of wave action was estimated by observing the
study sites at high tide on six occasions and counting the num¬
ber of waves breaking or impacting directly on or near the site.
Field sampling techniques were as follows. Standing
three feet behind the inshore border of the R. affine forest,
I established a benchmark and starting there, measured off a
square area two hundred inches on a side, with each side divi¬
ded into ten units, each twenty inches long. This provided a
square containing ten quadrats, each 20x20 inches square. With¬
in each sampling area, arandom numbers table was used to select
particular quadrats for study. It was desired to sample one
quadrat from the low, medium, and high regions of the R. affine
belt. After the first 20x20 inch quadrat was chosen, ran¬
dom coordinates were generated until a quadrat from each of the
other two heights had been selected. Positions of quadrats
chosen for study were marked by tying yellow plastic surveyors
tape to algae at the four corners. Within each selected quad¬
rat, a sampling frame was used, divided into one hundred 2x2
-4-
Allan Eisemann
inch squares. A random numbers table was used to choose par¬
ticular 2x2 inch squares within the 20x20 inch quadrat. If
R. affine was absent from one of the selected 2x2 inch areas,
coordinates for another square were randomly chosen until six
samples were taken from each quadrat. If six samples could not
be collected from the quadrat, a new quadrat was chosen. To
sample each 2x2 inch square, a plexiglas sampler (figure 2),
having an inside area of four square inches, was firmly pressed
onto the substrate at the site of the randomly selected square.
A foam rubber rim provided a good seal to the rock surface in
most areas. A rubber bulb and plastic tube were used to squirt
two to three ounces of hot (+30° C.) fresh water into the sam¬
pler to kill any animals that might otherwise escape during sam¬
pling. The water containing the small organisms was immediately
sucked back up into the plastic tube and deposited into a la¬
belled collection bag. The erect algae, including their hold¬
facts, and any sediments present were then removed with a sharp
knife and deposited in the same bag. In each of the three sam¬
pling areas, three 20x20 inch quadrats were chosen and six 2x2
inch samples of the R. affine forest were taken per 20x20 inch
quadrat for a total of fifty-four samples. In the laboratory,
the samples were placed in finger bowls and examined under a
dissecting scope. Counts were made of all animals present in
the size range 0.25-11 millimeters. The mesofauna of G. pap-
illata was sampled from the same sample areas, and from the same
20x20 inch quadrats previously sampled, using the same tech¬
niques. In cases where six samples of G. papillata could not
be taken from a marked quadrat, random numbers were generated
-5-
Allan Eisemann
to determine from which immediately adjacent 20x20 inch quadrat
the remaining G. papillata samples would be taken. All samples
of algae and sediments were dried for twenty-four hours on open
foil plates in an oven at 50° C. and then weighed on a Mettler
scale accurate to 0.Ol grams. Algae and sediments were dried
together as it was often difficult to completely separate the
two. Very small numbers of mesobiota might have remained at¬
tached to either the algae or sediments during the drying and
weighing processes.
The results obtained are shown in figures 3-9. The
major findings are indicated and discussed below.
Figure 3 compares the composition of the mesobiota of
R. affine and G. papillata, based on the pooled data of all
samples taken. No major qualitative differences occur in the
fauna associated with the two plant species. In terms of num¬
bers of individuals, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nematoda : Exact'>Nematoda</span> are the most abundant animals on
both algae, comprising 1/3 and 1/4 of the total fauna ofR. affine
and G. papillata, respectively. Copepoda make up approximately
1/5 of the fauna in both algae, and the small gastropods Tri¬
colia pulloides (Carpenter, 1865) and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Barleeia haliotiphila : Exact'>Barleeia haliotiphila</span>
Carpenter, 1864, comprise between 1/6 and 1/10 of the mesobiota,
with the relative abundances of these snails reversed in the
two algae. Mites make up 1/10 of the G. papillata mesofauna.
Other forms are found in lesser abundance.
While the upper and lower boundaries of the R. affine
belt were not specifically examined, the samples from low, med¬
ium, and high regions within the main R. affine belt were stud-
ied for possible differences in the composition and abundance
Allan Eisemann

of mesobiota. No significant variations were found. One pos¬
sible explanation of this is that the R. affine belt itself is
narrow in the study sites, on the average extending vertically
for about three feet in the lower midtide zone, from about mean
lower low water to approximately the three foot level. All
parts are submerged twice a day, and in a given area receive
roughly the same degree of turbulence and exposure to other en¬
vironmental factors. Since no significant differences were
found between means of samples from each 20x20 inch quadrat in
each sampling area, data from the three quadrats in each area
were combined and examined together.
In order to determine whether there were differences
between sampling areas A, B, and C in the abundance of mesobiota
associated with R. affine and G. papillata, pooled data for
the quadrats in each area were examined (figures 4 and 5).
In figure 4, for R. affine, only the four most abundant taxa
are plotted, and the three sampling areas, A, B, and C, are ar-
ranged in order of decreasing mean counts of individual organ¬
isms per four square inch sample. This order, A, C, B, also
corresponds with a decreasing degree of wave action in the sam¬
pling areas, and decreasing mean amounts of sediment per sample
of R. affine. Significant differences (p-0.01) occur between
sample areas A and B and also C and B in Nematoda, and between
sampling areas A and B in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tricolia pulloides : Exact'>Tricolia pulloides.</span> In general, high
mean counts per sample correspond to greater wave action and
larger amounts of sediment per sample. I did not expect to find
more trapped sediment in the region of a greater wave action.
However, perhaps the greater wave action results in more sediment
Allan Eisemann
in suspension, and R. affine grows in such thick, even lawns,
that it appears to trap coarse sediments well even where the
surf pounds over the plants at high tide.
For G. papillata (figure 5) the situation is different.
The sampling areas are arranged in the order of decreasing mean
amounts of sediment per sample, and only the four most abundant
taxa are shown. In G. papillata, the mean amount of sediment
per sample did not correspond directly or inversely with the de¬
gree of wave action. Significant differences (p-0.01) exist be¬
tween sampling areas C and B in Nematoda, Copepoda, and Barleeia
haliotiphila and between sampling areas C and B in Tricolia
pulloides. The trend from high to low mean counts per sample
varies more or less with the amount of sediment per sample ex¬
cept in the case of Tricolia pulloides. However, area C, with
the greatest amount of sediment per sample, still has the high¬
est number of gastropods, and in addition, the mean number of
Tricolia pulloides per square is low in both areas B and A.
In general, the mesofaunal population of G. papillata seems to
vary directly with the amount of sediment present. For G. pap-
illata, area A, the most wave swept, has the lowest amount of
sediment per sample. Area C, which receives a moderate degree
of wave action, has the highest amount of sediment. A possible
explanation of this is that the sediment in area C, mainly sand,
is trapped more readily by G. papillata than is the sandy and
shelly sediment mixture common to area A.
In order to determine more directly the relation between
mesofaunal abundances and sediments, I made qualitative analyses
of the amount of sediment per sample by estimating the sediment

coverage over the bottom of the three inch diameter finger bouls
in which the algal samples were placed. Complete coverage was
termed a large amount of sediment, partial coverage, moderate.
sparse coverage, small, and no sediment, zero. Figure 6 shows
a comparison of the mean numbers of individuals of the four most
abundant taxa per four square inch sample. The samples are ar¬
ranged in order of decreasing amount of sediment per sample.
For R. affine, significant differences (p=0.01) exist between
samples with large and small amounts of sediments for all four
taxa, and for G. papillata, between large and small and large
and zero samples. The figure does not present a comparison be¬
tween R. affine and G. papillata. Rather, it examines the dif-
ferences, within each algal species, between samples containing
different amounts of sediment. The data show clearly that, for
both algae, the number of animals present varies directly with
the amount of trapped sediment.
A direct comparison of the mean numbers of individuals
per gram dry weight of sampled material (algae plus holdfasts
and associated sediments) for the two plant species is shown
in figure 7. Significant differences (p-0.01) exist between R.
affine and G. papillata in the numbers of animals of the five
most abundant taxa, Nematoda, Copepoda, Barleeia haliotiphila,
Tricolia pulloides, and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lasaea cistula : Exact'>Lasaea cistula,</span> Keen, 1938, per gram dry
weight of sampled material.
The fact that R. affine is more effective in trapping
coarser sédiment particles than G. papillata suggests the pos¬
sibility that it might provide a safer refuge than G. papillata
for larger animals, although the same mesofaunal taxa occur in
Allan Eisemann
both plants. Figure 8 compares the sizes of the animals found
in R. affine and G. papillata. No significant differences in
size were found.
Figure 9 compares R. affine and G. papillata with re-
spect to the mean numbers of individuals per unit area for the
four most abundant taxa. Significant differences (p-0.001)
exist between R. affine and G. papillata in all three sampling
areas for Nematoda, in areas A and B for Copepoda, and in area
A for Tricolia pulloides. There is a significantly greater num¬
ber of animals per sample in R. affine than in G. papillata.
Perhaps R. affine contains more individuals than G. papillata
because R. af
Fine grows in thick, even lawns which not only
trap sediments well but also offer a habitat better protected
against wave action and dessication. In contrast, G. papillata
is more sparsely branched, forms sparser patches on the granite
substratum, and does not trap sediments as well. Fine organic
detritus is found clinging to the blades of both algal species,
but more is probably trapped, along with sediments, by R. affine.
Detritus and associated microorganisms are probably a main food
source for Nematods, Copepods, and Lasaea cistula, three of the
most abundant taxa, and they may contribute, at least in part,
to the diets of other organisms present in the R. affine belt.
