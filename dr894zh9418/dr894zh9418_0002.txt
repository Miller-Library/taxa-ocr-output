ABSTRACT
Although there have been many studies on the relationships
between certain fish and sea anemones in the tropics, very little
is known about the fish-anemone interactions in the colder waters
of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Ã„fter a seven week
investigation in Monterey Bay, I found that none of the fish
observed will acclimate to the tentacles of either of the intertidal
sea anemones Anthopleura xanthogrammica or Anthopleura
elegantissima, although the wooly Sculpin (Clinocottus analis)
will rest on the base or column of either.
also found that the Painted Greenling (Oxylebius pictus), as
well as other rock dwelling fish, will acclimate to the Strawberry
Anemone (Corynactis californica). The acclimation process takes
approximately 3-5 days, depending on the amount of contact
between the acclimating fish and the anemones, and the amount of
previous contacts with the anemones by other fish. There are two
mechanisms involved in the acclimation process. First of all,
through repeated contact, the fish picks up mucus from the
anemones and adds it to its own mucus layer. This causes each
anemone to recognize the acclimated fish as a part of itself and
prevents the fish from stimulating the anemone's chemoreceptors
for nematocyst discharge. Secondly, the anemones become
habituated to contact by the fish.
INTRODUCTION
There are two fish that were concentrated on during this
study. The first were the wooly Sculpins, Clinocottus analis.
These fish inhabit the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. They
are found from Baja, California to Cape Medocino, California and
are extremely abundant in the tidepools and shallows at Hopkins
Marine Station in Monterey
