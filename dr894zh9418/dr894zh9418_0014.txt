that did not may have been contaminated by blood when the fish
was killed. If the fins were covered with something that inhibited
nematocyst discharge, the contamination should not have caused
all anemones to react the same. Even if the contamination
contained chemicals that were active enough to override the
inhibition (lower the threshold to mechanical stimult more than
the inhibitors raised it), the reactions of acclimated anemones
should still have been somewhat less than those that were not
affected by the inhibitors at all. Inhibition must not be the
mechanism. On the other hand, if the mucus layer merely
contained no active chemicals, contamination would be expected to
cause similar reactions by both acclimated and nonacclimated
anemones. It is still possible, however, that there was merely a
lack of mucus on the areas touched against the anemones. This
would also cause all anemones, acclimated or not, to react the
same.
The most likely mechanism for protection is that the
anemone recongnizes the fish as part of itself. All observations
agree with this expanation. For example, consider that any
particular greenling can acclimate to more than one clone of C;
californica at a time. An acclimated fish put in a tank with a
different clone of anemones will be entirely unacclimated. So
even if there are no active chemicals to cause discharge of the one
clone, another clone will react. A fish in a tank with two clones
would pick up mucus from both clones. Assuming that the lack of
active chemicals causes protection, this combined mucus should
still contain chemicals from each clone that are active enough to
cause discharge on the other clone. If, however, each clone gives
the fish mucus that it can recognize, the fish will be recongnized
by both and will not cause nematocyst discharge on either. This is
what was observed, causing me to believe that this is the more
