APPENDIX
Exp. *1: During the dying process (the last four minutes), the fish
would shoot to the surface and then sink to the bottom. He
landed with his tall in the small A. xanthogrammica and his
tail was held by the tentacles. He swam out after 10 seconds
and again went to the surface and sank. Again he landed with
his tail in the small A. xanthogrammica and appeared to be
dead. The anemone pulled the greenling in towards its mouth
and after 90 seconds he was nearly 1/2 way in. Suddenly, the
greenling started thrashing violently and after seven seconds
was free. He landed on the sand and died.
Exp. *4: A Wooly Sculpin was dropped into the tank. It was still
somewhat dulled from COÂ» and just sank when 1 dropped it in.
On the way down, it touched three tentacles of the large A
xanthogrammica On contact, the fish immediately swam hard
away from the anemone. The three touched tentacles rolled in
and then immediately back out. The only other contact between
anemone tentacles and fish occurred when a piece of squid was
dropped to an anemone. A sculpin saw the squid just before it
reached the anemone and swam for it. But before it got to the
squid, the fish touched some tentacles and immediately
changed direction and swam away quickly. The anemone got the
squid and closed around it.
A Painted Greenling was also in this tank for over a week.
After the first hour, in which he sat on the right side of the
tank where I had dropped him in, I never saw him as far right as
the most left anemone (Map 4). He completely avoided them all.
Exp. 46: A Painted Greenling was put in a tank with at least three
different clones of C californica (Map 1). During observations
in the first 90 minutes, closure values for hit hard, hit and
brushed were 3, 3, and 2 respectively. The fish died of bubble
