is accomplished through the organism's nervous system.
The final theories assume that the mucus of the anemone is
transferred to the acclimating fish. One German researcher,
Schlichter concluded in 1976 that substances which inhibit
nematocyst discharge are produced by the anemones themselves
(Mariscal). Through repeated contact, the acclimating fish coats
its body with this inhibitor as to no longer induce nematocyst
discharge. Another possible explaination is that the anemone
identif ies the acclimated fish as a part of itself by recognizing its
own mucus on the fish.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All of the Clinocottus analis used were collected from
tidepools during low tide at Hopkins Marine Station. All other fish
tested (Oxylebius pictus, Coryphopterus nicholsii, and Orthonopias
triacis) were captured with anet from depths of 5-10 meters at
Hopkins Marine Station, the breakwater, or Lovers Point, all of
which are located in Monterey Bay.
For Tests With Anthopleura;
In each experiment l used a tank with two A. xanthogrammica
and one A. elegantissima, with approximate diameters of 15, 10.
and 10 centimeters respectively. All three anemones were
carefully removed from rocks in the intertidal zone of Hopkins
Marine Station. They were left in isolation for one week before
any experimentation was started, in which time they settled on
rocks in the observation tank. During observational experiments
(watching fish in tanks with anemones), all contacts and reactions
were noted, described and timed. In the experiment with forced
contact between anemones and Wooly Sculpins (Clinocottus
analis), the sculpins were held by the jaw with forceps and placed
tail first on one side of the ring of tentacles. Care was taken not
to touch the fish with my hands
