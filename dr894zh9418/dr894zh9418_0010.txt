Hopkins Marine Station was put in a tank with two different clones
of C californica, one orange and one pink, neither of which had
been previously in a tank with fish. As time passed, the closure
values for the orange clone decreased, showing acclimation. These
values are listed in Table *1 and graphed in Figure +1. In the first
75 hours, there were only 9 observed contacts with the pink
anemones, so closure values were not calculated for individual
observation periods. Of these 9 hits, 4 caused complete closure
while 5 caused anemones to close 1/2 (a combined closure value of
2.4). However, in the 80 hour and 89 hour observation periods,
there were more hits and closure values of 0.2 and 1.0 were found
This demonstrates the greenling's ability to acclimate to more
than one clone at a time.
Interesting results were found when a greenling was
acclimated to the orange anemones in one tank, moved to a new
tank with pink anemones, and then returned to the original tank 11
days later. The original acclimation closure values with the
orange anemones can be found in Table *2. Figure *2 shows the
closure values when the fish is put in and taken out of the first
tank, when the fish is put in the second tank, and when it is
returned to the original tank. Note that after 11 days, the fish
was still fairly acclimated (closure values for hit hard, hit, and
brushed were 1.0, 0.81, and 0.6 respectively).
It is also interesting to follow different situations for a
particular group of C californica One at a time, four fish were
introduced to the clonal groups of anemones in one of the tanks
(exp. 6, 7 (Table *2), 8, & 10). Figure +3 shows the closure values
calculated from the first observation p√©riod for each of these four
fish (2 greenlings, a Snubnose Sculpin, and then another greenling)
Each greenling had been previously isolated and all were
approximately the same size, yet the closure values upon
