The other fish studied were Painted Greenlings (also called
the convict fish), Oxylebius pictus. These fish live at depths
ranging from just below the intertidal to 50 meters along the
northeastern Pacific coast from Baja California to British
Columbia. They live under the canopy forming brown kelp
Macrocystis pyrifera Adult greenlings are residential, usually
occupying areas less than 10 square meters (DeMartini), and feed
from the rocks on a variety of invertebrates, especially
crustaceans and worms (Burgess and Axelrod).
Two intertidal species from the order Actiniaria were used
in this study: Anthopleura xanthogrammica and Anthopleura
elegantissima They each have strongly adherent bases and have
columns covered with verrucae, which are evaginations with
modified ectoderm and no nematocysts which are able to cling to
such things as rocks and shells (Carlgren). They have large, strong
tentacles and can therefore catch fairly large prey. Both practice
dioecious reproduction, although A. elegantissima also has the
ability to reproduce by longitudinal fission, forming aggregations
of a single clone (Sebens). They are part ially supported by the
symbiotic algae Zooxanthellea (Friese).
The other anemone studied was the Strawberry Anemone,
Corynactis californica. This anemone-like species is in the order
Corallimorpharia It is morphologically similar to corals, but it
lacks any skeleton. It has a smooth column and thin tentacles with
acrospheres at the distal ends. Acrospheres are globular ends of
tentacles containing numerous potent nematocysts (Carlgren).
This anemone is very abundant in Monterey Bay and occurs in
California from San Diego to Sonoma County. It is found in shaded
areas from the low intertidal to 30 meters. Corynactis californica
reproduces asexually by longitudinal fission and is found in clonal
groups (Hand).
