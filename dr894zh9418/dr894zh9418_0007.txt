For Tests With Corynactis californica:
One rock of C californica was collected from a depth of 8
meters at the breakwater of Monterey Bay. All other rocks were
collected from the Del Monte shalebeds of Monterey Bay at depths
of 13-16 meters. For all observational experiments, tanks would
be watched for a couple hours and then left for a few hours
repeatedly over several days. All rocks with C californica were
mapped such that individual anemones could be accounted for (See
Maps 1-3).
During a given observation period, all contacts were recorded
by anemone number and type of contact. Three types were used: hit
hard, hit, and brushed. One of four types of reactions by the
anemone was then recorded: closed, closed 1/2, slight retraction,
or none. When an anemone closed, the amount of time before
opening was also marked for some experiments. For any
observation period, a "closure value" could be calculated. Each of
the reaction types was assigned a number: closed=3, closed
1/2=2, slight retraction=1, and none=O. For all contacts in a
period, these numbers were added up and divided by the total
number of contacts. This would result in a closure value between
O and 3.
One experiment using various parts of Painted Greenlings
was also done. A fish was captured in a clean glass bowl to
prevent contamination. The fish was then placed on its side in a
clean pan, keeping its tail up with forceps. The spinal cord just
behind the head was quickly severed and the tail and side facing up
were left uncontaminated. The pectoral fin, ventral fin, and tail
were then removed and tested on anemones. The anemones were
put in just enough water to cover them such that the body parts
could be touched to anemones without letting the areas cut touch
the water. This prevented internal body fluids from entering the
