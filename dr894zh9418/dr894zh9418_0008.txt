water and possibly triggering the chemoreceptors.
The final experiment done with C californica involved an
attempt to acclimate my finger to a clonal group of anemones from
the shalebeds. Irubbed the end of my index finger against 172 of
the anemones (which were closed) and then tested the reactions of
open anemones to my touch.
RESULTS: FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Both Anthopleura xanthogrammica and Anthopleura
elegantissimawere studied in the tide pools of Hopkins Marine
Station. The only contact ever seen involved a wooly Sculpin and
an A. Xanthogrammica The sculpin was sitting on the column of
the anemone, approximately 1/2 way between the oral and pedal
discs. Another observation involved an A. xanthogrammica, four
Wooly Sculpins, and a Monkey Faced Eel. The anemone was
attached to a vertical rock surface just above the bottom of the
pool such that its tentacles reached the bottom. This formed a
small shelter between the sand, rock, and tentacles (Diagram 1)
saw a fish go behind the tentacles, but it was too dark to see
where it went. I could see that nothing was touching the
anemone's tentacles. By putting a net on one side of the anemone
and sticking my hand under on the other side, I captured the four
sculpins and the eel. Finally, a fellow student found a bead that
she had used to mark a small Clinocottus analis near the mouth of
an anemone in one of her study tide pools.
All field observations with C californica were made using
SCUBA. Painted Greenlings were almost always found on the same
rocks as C californica, though contact was only observed once. A
fairly large greenling was found at 8 meters on a field of
anemones covering approximately one square meter. Using my
hand, I caused him to move three times before he left. Each time
he landed on another part of the anemone cluster, and none of the
