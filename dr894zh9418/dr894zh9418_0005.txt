swimming anemone, Stomphia coccinea, will not capture any prey
while its pedal disc is detached from the substratum. It was also
found, using coverslips coated with food extract and the anemone
Anemonia sargassensis, that tactile stimulation of the body
column increases the amount of discharge. Even the ambient light
intensity, though cnidocytes are not considered to be
photosensitive, affects the responsivness of cnidocytes and the
ability to capture prey. Other factors influencing the
physiological state of the anemones, such as ions in the ambient
medium and the amount of recent feeding, also seem to affect the
amount of cnidae discharge (Thorington and Hessinger).
The acclimation process between anemonefish and their
hosts has been studied for years, but most of these studies have
taken place in the tropics where the fish actually lives within the
tentacles of a single host. There are a few different theories on
how the acclimation takes place.
The first set of theories assumes that the anemone makes
certain changes and is responsible for the acclimation (Gohar).
They feel that the anemone changes or inhibits its pattern of
nematocyst discharge due to the behavioral, physical, or chemical
stimuli of the acclimating fish.
Contrary to these are the theories in which the fish is
responsible for its protection from the anemones by in some way
changing its mucus layer. Some feel that the mucus layer after
acclimation contains no active agents or other factors which are
known to stimulate the chemoreceptors, causing nematocyst
discharge upon contact (Lubbock). Ã–thers feel that certain
chemicals in the mucus layer inhibit nematocyst discharge
(Davennport & Norris). This inhibition can occur in one of two
ways. There is either direct inhibition of the
cnidocyte-nematocyst complex on the tentacles, or this inhibitior
