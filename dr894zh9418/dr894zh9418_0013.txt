that prevents the fish from stimulating the chemoreceptors to
cause nematocyst discharge. This is demonstrated by the
acclimation of my finger to the anemones. Another observation
that supports this theory was that even after acclimation, on the
rare occasion that the face of a fish hit an anemone, the anemone
always closed. If the fish was producing a protective mucus layer
itself, the face would also be protected. Since the face rarely
touched anemones, it did not accumulate enough anemone mucus
for protection.
The Painted Greenling seems able to maintain this
protection through its mucus layer for a long time. One fish was
removed from its acclimated anemones for 11 days and was still
fairly acclimated upon return to the tank. This is quite different
from the inability of Amphiprion bicinctus to remain acclimated
to Radianthus koseirensis (Graefe, 1964). Graefe observed that if
this fish was seperated from its host anemone for 1 hour or more,
it would be stung upon its return.
One main theory behind mucus protection is that the mucus
does not contain any of the active chemicals needed to trigger the
chemoreceptors. Another claims that certain chemicals inhibit
nematocyst discharge, possibly by raising the threshold to
mechanical stimuli. Finally, the anemone may recognize its own
mucus on the fish and identify the fish as part of itself.
It seems very unlikely that the mucus contains inhibitors to
nematocyst discharge. If inhibitors were present in the anemone's
mucus layer, they would interfere in the anemone's normal feeding
and protective reactions.
One experiment that may support the lack of excitatory
factors was the testing of greenling body parts with anemones.
While some fins caused a notable difference in reactions between
acclimated and nonacclimated anemones, others did not. Those
