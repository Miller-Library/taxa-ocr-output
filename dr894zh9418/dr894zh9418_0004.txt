In a recent publication, The Biology of Nematocysts
(Thorington and Hessinger). Thorington and Hessinger described
their study of nematocyst discharge and listed some of the factors
affecting this discharge. Like most researchers of nematocysts,
they found that concomitant mechanical and chemical stimulation
of the cnidocytes is required to initiate or trigger the discharge
of the cnidae. The cnidocytes are specialized secretory cells on
the tentacles that are also considered independent effectors and
directly perceive stimuli for discharge.
The mechanism for discharge involves chemosensitization of
the cnidocytes by the active chemicals, which then lower the
mechanical threshold of cnida discharge. Chemical stimulation
alone has occasionally been found to cause discharge, but only
under more stringent conditions (using very harsh chemicals) than
are found in the natural environments of the anemones. In some
anemone tentacles mechanical stimulation alone can cause some
discharge, but in every case adding appropriate chemical
stimulation to mechanical stimulation causes much greater
discharge. Some of the active chemicals have been isolated and
include n-acetylated sugars and various amino compounds.
N-acetylated sugars are common in the mucus layers of many
organisms that are prey for anemones. These sugars cause
immediate discharge on contact with the tentacles. Then, after
nematocysts have pierced the prey, body fluids containing
numerous amino compounds are released and stimulate further
discharge.
For years cnidocytes were considered independent effectors
with direct control over the cnidae discharge and no intervention
of the nervous system. Certain observations, however, show that
the nervous system seems to have either a modulatory or an
inhibitory influence on cnidae discharge. For example, a
