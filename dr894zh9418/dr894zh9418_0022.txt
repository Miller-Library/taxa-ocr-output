FIGURE LEGENDS
FIGURE 1: This graph shows a Painted Greenling becoming
acclimated to the C californica shown in Map 3. The line
represents closure values for hits, the dark spots on top
represent hit hard, and the plus signs represent brushes. The
one high brush mark and the highest hit mark are from
observations in which the greenling's face hit and closed
anemones.
Figure 2: This shows closure values for a greenling in a variety of
different situations. First it is introduced to orange C
californica and then is taken out after acclimation (140 hours).
It is put in with a new clone (pink) and again is completely
unacclimated. Finally, after 11 days, the fish is put back in
with the orange anemones and is still fairly acclimated, but not
completely.
Figure 3: The first four bars represent the introduction of different
fish to the same clone of C californica Notice the initial
closure values go down for each successive greenling. The final
two bars show that the second greenling introduced took longer
to acclimate than the third greenling. This is due to
mechanical habituation.
