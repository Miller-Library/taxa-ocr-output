introduction to the tank go down with each successive greenling.
This implies some type of mechanical habituation by the anemones
to repeated contact by fish.
Another example of this mechanical habituation is the
acclimation periods of the second and third greenlings mentioned
above. The third greenling was entirely acclimated after 72 hours.
The second greenling, however, was only partially acclimated:
after 72 hours and was not fully acclimated until over 100 hours
after introduction to the tank. This is also shown in Figure r3.
Finally, I looked at all the "hit hard" contacts throughout my
observations. For each contact, I counted how many times that
particular anemone had been hit before. For anemones that closed,
they had previously been hit an average of 1.6 times. Anemones
that closed 172 had been hit an average of 4.0 times, while slight
retraction anemones had been hit an average of 5.5 times. This
shows the mechanical habituation by individual anemones.
RESULTS: FORCED CONTACT EXPERIMENTS
Using forceps to hold wooly Sculpins by the jaw, contact
with the tentacles of Anthopleura was forced. One small A.
xanthogrammica had its mouth already partly open. A small (3.
cm.) sculpin was touched to the tentacles, and as soon as there
was contact, the fish was engulfed. Within 1 second I could not
even see the fish, let alone try to save it. Next I tested a similar
fish (3.3 cm.) with A. elegantissima It was caught and
disappeared as quickly as the fish above. Both anemones were
fully opened around 8 minutes after catching the fish. Obviously,
Anthopleura are willing to eat Clinocottus analis.
Body parts from two acclimated greenlings were tested with
both acclimated and non acclimated anemones. The results can be
found in Table *3. For the pectoral fins of both fish and the
ventral fin of the second fish, the acclimated anemones responded
