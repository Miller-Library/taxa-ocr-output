probable mechanism.
The other important aspect of acclimation involves
habituation by the anemones to repeated contact by the fish. This
was first observed in a three clone tank of C californica in which
successive greenlings showed lower initial closure values and
shorter acclimation periods. It was also seen in individual
anemones in that stronger reactions were observed for anemones
that had been previously hit less times.
The mechanism for this habituation is unknown, though it
probably involves modulation by the nervous system. Thorington
and Hessinger (Thorington and Hessinger) showed that various
types of modulation do occur for certain species of anemones. For
example, one experiment showed that tactile stimulation of the
body column of Anemonta sargassensis will increase the amount
of discharge by the cnidae on the tentacles. No tests were done on
habituation to repeated contact.
Besides the mechanism of habituation to contact for the
anemones, there are other aspects of acclimation that need to be
studied further. A complete examination of anemone mucus would
help to determine how the anemone recognizes its own mucus if
this indeed is the mechanism behind the protection from
nematocyst discharge. Possibly one could determine the chemicals
detected by the chemoreceptors. It would also be interesting to
see if an active chemical present on the fish could cause discharge
despite recognition by the anemone of its own mucus.
