anemones closed. The only reactions observed were occasional
slight retractions.
Another interesting observation was the abundance of
Snubnose Sculpins (Orthonopias triacis) and Blackeyed Gobies
(Coryphopterus nicholsiD on the same rocks as the greenlings and
C californica A Spubnose Sculpin was once seen with its pectoral
fin on an anemone that was still open. Finally, a Northern
Spearnose Poacher (Agonopsis emmelane) was found resting on
four anemones. I pulled him off by the tail and released him. He
immediately returned to the anemones, none of which showed any
reaction.
RESULTS: TANK OBSERVATIONS
With Anthopleura:
A Painted Greenling with bubble disease was placed in a
small tank with the three Anthopleura In the first hour, the fish
made contact with only the tentacles 5 times. In all 5 cases, the
anemones responded with a feeding motion; the tentacles rolled in
toward the mouth and then immediately back out. Then, as the fish
died an hour later, it landed in one of the A. xanthogrammica
twice. Both times the anemone attempted to eat the fish (exp. 1).
The other greenling tested with Anthopleura was in a much larger
tank. It stayed in the far left 1/3 of the tank, away from the
anemones, for the entire week of observation (Map *4).
Similar feeding responses were observed both times a
Clinocottus analis touched an Anthopleura (exp. *4). But unlike
the Painted Greenlings, Wooly Sculpins were often seen resting on
the pedal discs and columns of these anemones.
With Corynactis californica:
All the Painted Greenlings that acclimated to C californica
did so in approximately 3-5 days. For example, a greenling from
