less than the previously isolated anemones. But for the tails of
both fish and the ventral fin of the first fish, there is little or no
difference, possibly due to contamination by blood when the fish
had its spinal cord cut.
As a final experiment, l acclimated my index finger to a
clone of C californica After ten minutes of rubbing my finger on
closed anemones, I was able to lightly touch the tentacles of an
opened anemone on the same rock without causing a reaction.f
then touched this anemone with a different finger, the anemone
would close. The acclimated finger was covered by a slimy
substance that must have been anemone mucus. It is this mucus
that protected my finger from nematocyst discharge.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Observations with Anthopleura show that fish did not
acclimate to the tentacles of either A. elegantissima or A.
xanthogrammica. Painted Greenlings avoid these anemones
completely. Wooly Sculpins, on the other hand, merely avoid the
tentacles. They will rest on both the pedal disc and column of an
anemone, and were even seen using an anemone for protection in
the field. If contact with Anthopleura tentacles does occur,
however, the anemone will attempt to eat the fish.
It is also clear that Painted Greenlings (and probably
Northern Spearnose Poachers, Snubnose Sculpins, and maybe
Blackeyed Gobies) do acclimate to the Strawberry Anemone,
Corynactis californica This acclimation period takes
approximately 3-5 days.
The acclimation process seems to occur through two main
mechanisms. The first involves a change in the mucus layer of the
fish. Though there have been claims that the fish secretes the
protective substances, it seems more likely that the fish picks up
anemone mucus through repeated contact. It is this mucus layer
