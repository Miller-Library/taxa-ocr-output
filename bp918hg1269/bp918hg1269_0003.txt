DISCUSSION
The lack of agreement between the composite nitrogen values
and those obtained by digestion suggests that the predominant ex-
cretory product is not identical to uric acid. The low amounts of
excretory products present in the fluid will regire considerable
concentration of the fluids before the nature of the products can be
determined with certainty.
If we can assume that uric acid is indeed the principle nitrogenous
excretory product in Balanus nubilus, then we can ask the question
why. Possible the gross anatomy of the animal offers a clus. Essential-
ly, the barnacle is housed in its shell with limited access to the out-
side. In periods of low tide, when the animal is exposed, it would
be advantageous to excrete the insoluble uric acid rather than the
toxic and soluble ammonia or urea. This is possible, but no especially
meaningful since Palanus nubilus is usually not exposed for over
oe
six hours, and the low concentrations found a four hours of incubation
would not seem to be toxic.
SUMMARY
Studies on the nitrogenous excretory products of Balanus nubilus
indicate that the barnacle excretes a large part of the total nitrogen
in the form of a uric acid-like material.
