added in contrast to the saturated sodium carbonate proscribed in Tern-
bergs original method.
Urea was assayed after conversion to ammonium carbonate by a 15 min.
incubation with 0.1 ml. of a 50 mg.?ml. soln of urease and distilled
water (urease obtained from Matheson, Coleman, and Bell).
Uric acid was determined using the colorimetric method of Sobrin-
ho- Simöes (1965).
The microdiffusion tecnique was found to be reproducible within
10.22 ug of nitrogen. The digestion procedure for total nitrogen,
however, was reproducible only within + 1.5 ug of nitrogen.
RESULTS
Balanus nubilus was found to excrete ammonia and uric acid (see
lable 1), but no urea was detected. The uric acid was in very high rela-
tive concentrations, averaging 80% of the total nitrogen from composite
tests (uric acid N - 3.3 1.9 ug/ml., NHg N - 0.89 + .12 ug/ml.). How-
ever when the total nitrogen was assayed for by digestion, the quan-
tity was invariably lower than the sum of the composite tests (3.5 +
1.5 ug/ml. as compared to 4.1 + 1.7 ug/ml.). The assays on body fluid
gave the same results, but in higher concentrations. Statistically,
the ranges for the total nitrogen assay and the composite assays are com¬
patible, but the spotty reproduciblity of the digestion procedure still
reduces the confidence in the extreme accuracy of the results.
