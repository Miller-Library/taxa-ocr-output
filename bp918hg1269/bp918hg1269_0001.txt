INTRODUCTION
Studies on nitrogenous excretion in crustaceans have shown this
group to be principally ammonotelic, excretiag from 40 to 85% of their
total nitrogen as ammonia (Parry, 1960). However, most of the
species examined have been decapods and virtually nothing is known
of exretion in barnacles. This study was designed to determine the
kinds and amounts of nitrogenous excretory products in the barnacle,
Balanus nubilus. This species was chosen because of its large size
and because large quantities of mantle cavity fluid containing excretory
products could easily be obtained without injury to the animal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The specimens used measured from 4 to 8.5 cm. in basal shell dia-
meter and were collected from the pilings at Fisherman's Wharf in Mon-
terey, California. They were scraped free of adherent debris and
commensal organisms and were placed in running seawater in the labora-
tory. Prior to collection of fluid for analysis, the animals were re-
moved from their tanks, blotted, and allowed to stand for 4 hours.
Fluid was drained by inverting the animals over a beaker; an average
of 2 ml. per barnacle was obtained in this manner. The fluid was pooled
and deprotinized with 10% Na Tungstate and 2/3 N Sulfuric Acid according
to Haden's modification of the method of Folin and Mu (1923).
lotal nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and urea nitrogen were determined
by the microdiffusion technique of Ternberg (1965). Total nitrogen was
determined with a 1 ml. sample after digestion with concentrated
sulfuric acid saturated with cupric sulfate. These samples were diluted
with 0.6 ml. of distilled water and 4 ml. of 10N sodium hydroxide were
