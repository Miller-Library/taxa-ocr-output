and all three could correlate these changes with environmental
factors, such as temperature in the case the American eel and
Punoulus, and salinity in the case of vtilus In all three cases
natural selection was shown to be a probable force in creating the
clines, and therefore the polumorphisms.
Th√®re have been considerably fewer cases where natural selection
could be positivelg identified as a force for mainteining variation
when no clines were present. Werd Wett's work on Colias butterflies
is one such case (Watt, 1984), and Ronald Burton and Harcus Feldman's
work on the copepod Tigriopus is another (Burton and Feldman, 1982.)
Both of these groups have correlated the function of a specific enzume
with differential fitness among individuals cerrying alternate alleles
for the loci studied. These cases are dwarfed by the number studies in
which variation is observed and the forces, if ang, maintaining it have
get to be discovered. Among these are the mang geographic population
studies in which no obvious patterns of allele frequencies were found.
Hang of the projects involving marine organisms on the west coast of
North America fall into this category (see Levinton et al, 1978. Dayis
et al, 1931, Smith et al, 1987, Grant, 1988.)
Altnough there still exists controversy over the meaning and
importance of allelic variation to evolution, this variation has
recentig proven itself useful in the studg of the population dunamics
oi marine organisms. Traditional methods of studging population
subdivision, migration and gene flow by direct observation are
ditticult, if not impossible, to perform on small marine organisms.
