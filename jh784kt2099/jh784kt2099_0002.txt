Introduction
Since the advent of starch gel electrophoresis in the late 1960s
à great deal of genetic variation has been discovered in countless
populations of orgenisms. Plants, insects, reptiles, mammals.
invertebrstes, birds, and mang other groups have all been studjed and
shown to harbor vast amounts of allelic variation within their
populations. Discovering why this variation exists and its importance
to evolutionary and population biology has been a more difficult and
controversial task. Most explanations can be separated into two
catégories: those that invoke natural selection as a force responsible
for maintaining genetic variation, and those that believe most of the
variation observed is selectivelg neutral. These positions are
commonly known as the selectionist and neutralist theories.
respectivelg. A great deal of time and effort has been spent on truing
to prove or disprove both of these positions.
Hany studies have sought to prove that environmental factors, and
hence natural selection, are responsible for maintaining allelic
polgmorphisms. Hang of these studies have been performed on marine
organisms, and among the more significant are williams, Koehn and
rtton's work on ihe American eel, Anguille restrsts (Williams et al
1972), Koehn, Hilkman, and Mitton's work on the blue mussel, Ftilus
edulis (Koehn et al, 1975), and Power's group's work on a fish
Fundulus beterochitus (Powers, 1985.) All three of these studies
found signiticant changes in allele frequencies over geographic areas,
