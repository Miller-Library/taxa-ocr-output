Ui the five scored loci, Pgi-1, Pgm, To, and Hk were polumorphic
in all populations studied. Näh-2 was monomorphic in all populations
studied. Table shows the allele frequencies for all loci st each
Tetreclite studg site. Alleles are referred to by letter, with A being
the fastest moving allele, and F the slowest. For Pgi, each sample site
has one verj common allele (75-858), one intermediate allele (5-155)
and two or three rare alleles («53). All populations had the same
common allele, but theg differed in the frequencies of the rarer alleles
(see figure 2). In Horro Bay, allele C is the second most common
allele, while in all other populations allele B is the second most:
common. None of the Hoss Landing samples showed allele E. which had
a frequency of 58 in Pacific Grove, only 20 miles awag. The Port
Hueneme samples lacked allele A. The Pgi allele frequencies were
found to differ significantli between sampling locations using a G test
for independence (Sokal and Polhf, 1981.) All the Pgi heterozugotes
displaged a three banded pattern on the gels tupical of a dimeric
enzyme. There were six alleles at the Pam locus, and theu fall into a
pattern similar to Pgi. All populations had one verq common allele
one intermediate allele, and several rare alleles (figure 3). The
gitferences in Pgm allele frequencies were not found to be significant
(pe 1). Tetrazolium oxidase was scored only for Morro Bau and Port
Hueneme, and both locations had verg similar allele frequencies
(tigure 4). Hk was scored for Hoss Landing, Horro Bau and Port
