Table Captions
lable l: Tetraclite allele frequencies at four polymorphic loci. Allele A
is in all cases the fastest moving allele (most anodal), and allele f the
slowest (most cathodal). A — indicates missing data, a means the allele
was not found.
äble II: Expected subpopulation heterozygositg, Hs; observed
heterozygositg, Hi; expected population heterozygositu, Ht; the inbreeding
coefficient, Fis; the subpopulation fixation index, Fst; and the estimated
nümber of migrants per generation, Nm for each of the four Tetreclita
sample sites.
Table III: Coefficients of relation for the four Tetreclite subpopulations.
able IV: Comparison of allelic frequencies between samples from high
and low in the intertidal zone, medium to large barnacles onlu.
lable V. Allele frequencies from samples small, recentlu settled
Tetraclita (less than 4 mm)
Table VI: Comparison of allelic frequencies between samples from high
and low in the intertidel zone, verg small barnacles only. The Pai allele
frequencies are significently different between high and low (05.05).
lable VII: Allelic frequencies at four polgmorphic loci for a population of
Semibolenus coriosus sampled at Half Hoon Bau.
