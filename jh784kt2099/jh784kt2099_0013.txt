introduction, Point Conception and the Monterey Bag Cangon, the latter
seems to be a more likely candidete as a berrier to Tetractite laryee.
This is not too surprising, considering Honterei Bag is the northern
limit for large Tetraclita populations on the west cosst. It is not
known whether Tetrachite populations do not appear north of Hontereu
bay because they cannot get there, or because they are not capable of
surviving north of the bag. Hy results indicate that Hoss Landing mau
be a very isolated subpopulation, which supports the idea that
Montereg Bay is a berrier to northern migration. The Moss Landing
subpopulation mag be important es a stepping stone to the north, and
mag supply larvae which will eventuallg form populations north of
Monterey Bay. It seems likelg, however, that the barriers which
isolate Hoss Landing from the south will also isolate it from the
north, so this expansion, if it happens, could be a very slow process
Evolutionsry implications and Semibalanus cariosus:
My results have some relevance to the neutralistselectionist
argument about the importance of genetic variation. In brief, the
neutralist position is that most, if not all, natural genetic variation is
selectively neutral and meaningless so far as the individual fitness of
an organism is concerned. The selectionist argument maintains that
much or at least some of the observed genetic variation is adaptive
and maintained by natural selection. My results bear on this argument
in two ways: 1) The values lobtained for Mm varied between loci. I
all the variation observed was selectively neutral, the figation indices
