onlg 2 loci. The R values varied considerably from site to site, with
Port Hueneme having a negstive value (less related then would te
expected bi chance) and Hoss Landing having the rather high value of
23. This means that on average ang two individuals sampled at Hoss
LÃ¤nding share two grandparents. The value of 008 at Pacific Groye
indicates that those individuals are no more related then would be
expect by chance, and the value of 13 at Horro Bay indicates that
those individuals are slightig more related to each other then would be
expected by chance.
Interticsl verietion.
At the Pacific Grove study site individuals were sampled
speciticallg from both the verg bottom and the verg top of their
intertidal range. In addition, verg small individuals were sampled.
again both from the bottom and top of the specie's range. No
signiticant differences in allele frequencies were found between high
and low intertidal samples when only medium to large indiviquals
were sampled, and there were no significant differences in allelic
frequencies between large individuals and small individuals as a group
(tables IVand V) However, there were significant differences in
allele frequency at the Pgi locus between high intertidal and low
intertidal samples among the small individuals alone (p005, table y1)
he small barnacies were estimated to be about two months old
