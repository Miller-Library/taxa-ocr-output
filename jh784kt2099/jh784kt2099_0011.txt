Interspecitic veristion:
able VIl gives the alleic frequencies at all four polumorphic loci
scored for the population of Semibslanus cariosus sampled at Half
rioon Bag. Each locus has the same alleles as the Tetraclite
populations, and only at the To locus are the allelic frequencies
signiticantig different from the averaged allelic frequencies of the
letraclite populations. Nei's genetic identity (Nei 1975) between
the pooled Tetraclits populations and the Semibalanus population
equals 9903, a figure normally associsted with two populations
within the same species.
Discussion
Geegrechic veristian
he allele frequencies at each location sampled are clearlu veru
simllar, and the estimated number of migrants per generation between
sample sites is quite high, as might be expected for an intertidal
species with a pelagic larval period. However, the individuals sampled
probablg do not belong to a single panmictic population, and the
results suggest ihat the dispersal patterns for barnscle larva are
quite complex. The Pgi allele frequencies are significantlu different
between subpopulations, indicating that either some subpopulations
ere isolated endugh from each other for genetic drift to occur, or there
