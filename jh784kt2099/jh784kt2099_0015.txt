have been enough time for their allelic frequencies to have diverged
considerably were the alleles involved selectivelu neutral. If, on the
other hand, the polgmorphism was adaptive for the common ancestral
species of both Tetraclits and Semibalsnus, and the forces
maintsining the allele frequencies remained in place after the tyo
groups diverged, then it is possible that the polumorphisms could
remain and be maintained in the now separate species. Thus, the
polgmorphisms shared by the two species may be older than the
species themselves.
