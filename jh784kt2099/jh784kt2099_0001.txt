Abstract
The biochemical genetics of an intertidal bernacle, Tetreclite
rubescens (Darwin, 1354), were examined at four sample sites along
the coast of central California. Examination of the allelic frequencies
at four polymorphic loci indicate that gene flow between
subpopulations is either currentlg high or was so veru recentlu. Not
all sites, however, appear to exchange migrants equallu. The samples
from the Moss Landing site appear to be closelg related to each other.
and other evidence suggests that Moss Landing may be quite isolated
from the more southern populations. Point Conception does not appear
to be a major barrier to gene flow, and migration between Pecific
Grove and Pori Hueneme, three hundred miles awag, appears to be
greater than migration between Pacific Grove and Hoss Landing, onlu
twenty miles awag. A population oi Semibalanus cariasus (Pallas.
1768) was also studied, and found to be almost indistinquishable from
the Tetrsclita populations at all four polymorphic loci scored. This
indicates that strong selection pressures mag be maintaining these
allelic frequencies, and the polumorphisms mag be older than the
species themselves.
