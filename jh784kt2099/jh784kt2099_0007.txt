dependent
Dsts enslysis: For each sample site, Fst, an inbreeding
coefficient which measures population subdivision, and Nm. an
estimate of the number of migrants per generation was calculated
(Hartl and Clark 1989, chapter 6). Fst-(Ht-Hst)/Ht, and
Nm=17AFst-174, where Ht is the expected heterozugositu if all
samples from all the sampling sites belong to a single panmictic
population, and Hst is the expected heterozygosity of a subpopulation
assuming random mating is occurring within the subpopulation. R. the
coefficient of relation, wes calculated by a computer program (Jeff
Mitton, unpublished) based on the following equation (Queller and
Goodnight, 1939): R=2222(Pi(-j)-Pm)/EZZZ(Pijm-Pm), where i=groups
j-individuals within a group, k-loci, and a-allelic positions within a
locus. All of these statistics are useful in estimating the amount of
subdivision within a population. Fst estimates the loss of
heterozygositg due to population subdivision ( the Wahlund effect). Mm
estimates the amount of migration between subpopulatjons, and R
describes how closely related the individuals in a subpopulation are, in
terms of the probability of shared alleles.
