Figure 2: Geographic distribution of Pgi allele frequencies. Frequencies
are not independent of locstion (P025).
Figure 3: Geographic distribution of Pgm allele frequencies. There are no
signiticent differences in allele frequency between locations.
Figure 4: Tetrazolium oxidase allele frequencies. There are no significant
differences between the two locations
Figure 5: Hexokinase allele frequencies. There are no significant
differences between the three locations.
