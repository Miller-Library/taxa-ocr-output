are local selection pressures which favor different allelic frequencies
in ditierent places. If local selection is occurring, it is probablu vert
slight, since in general the allele frequencies at esch location sampled
are quite similar.
he coefficients of relation indicate that some subpopulations
probably retain most of their larvae. Moss Landing, with an R of 23
seems to be particularly isolated from the other subpopulations. In
addition to being the northernmost breeding group of Tetrsclits
(Kristi Hiller, personal communication), the Moss Landing
subpopulation is also located right at the mouth of the Montereu Bau
Cangon, which mag act as a barrier to larval dispersal from the more
southern populations. The Horro Bay samples were taken from calm
water deep within a harbor, and their R of 13 suggests that theu mau
also be a fairly isolated subpopulation. The samples from Pacific
Grove were taken right at the southern edge of Honterey Bag, and the
samples from Port Heuneme were taken from the open coast. Neither
of these had large positive R values, indicating that these
subpopulations may recruit individuals from a greater area then either
the Horro Bay or Hoss Landing subpopulations do. it seems quite
possible that the Pacific Srove subpopulstion trades more migrants
witn Port Hueneme, three hundred miles awag, then it does with Hoss
Langing, only twenty miles awag. This idea is further supported bu
the Hoss Landing subpopulation's lack of Pgi allele E, which is present
ai 4-53 at both Pacific Grove and Port Hueneme.
