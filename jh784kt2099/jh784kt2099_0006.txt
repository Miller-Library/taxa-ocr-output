samples from Pacific Grove and Hoss Landing were kept on ice for un
to three hours before being stored at -70 degrees C. I analuzed all the
samples within four weeks of sampling time, and the number of
thaw/freeze cycles was kept to a minimum.
Sample pregeration and analysis All semples were diluted with
one to three drops of distilled water, homogenized bi ultre sound, and
then spun down for three to four minutes in a high speed
microcentrifuge. The homogenates were absorbed into whatmans's *1
Tilter paper, and analgzed using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis.
Gel preparation consisted of pouring a mixture of 35 g starch (Sigma)
suspended in 50 ml of cold buffer solution into 220 ml of boiling
butter solution. The final 3ooml volume was mixed vigorouslu.
degassed, and poured into 17 cm by 17 em bg 1 em molds. The gels
were cooled to 4 degrees C before loading the samples. Enzumatic
activitg was detected at the following loci: phosphoglucoisomerase
(Pgi-1 and Pgi-2), phosophoglucomutase (Pgm); tetrazolium oxidase
(To), hexokinase (Hk-1 and Hk-2), malate dehgdrogenase (Mah-1 and
fidh-2), malic enzyme (He), acid phosphotase (Acp), and xanthine
dehydrogensse (Xdh). Onlg Pgi-1, Pgm, To, Hk-2, and Hoh-1 were
scored. The other loci were either not resolved well engugh to be
scorable,or in the case of Hk-1 and Fgi-2, were detectable onlu in
verij small individuals. The buffer systems used are described in
Agals et al (1973) Buffer "C"(Tris, citrate, EDTA,PH 70) was usedto
resolve all scored loci. The enzyme stains used were all from
Eichardson (1956), except that the GÃ¶pdh used as a linking enzume in
