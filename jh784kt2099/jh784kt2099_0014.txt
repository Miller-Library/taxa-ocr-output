and estimates of Nm should have been nearly identical. Even leaving
out the extremelg high To estimate, there may still be enough
variation in the estimates derived from the other loci to implicate
selection pressure as a force affecting allelic frequencies. 2) The
population of Semibalsnus cariosus sampled at Half Hoon Bau was
almost indistinguishable from the Tetraclits populations at all four
polgmorphic loci studied. It seems unlikely that this is merelu a
coincidence, and there are several alternative possibilities to explain
this result. One possibility is that the two groups are reallu onlu one
species, and there is extensive gene flow between them. This seems
extremelg unlikelg, since there are important morphological
differences between the two groups, and theg brood at opposite times
of the geer (Horris, Abbot, Haderlie, 1980 p517,519). A second
explanation is that there are strong selective forces operating on both
species which maintain the allele frequencies at the same levels. This

Their geographical ranges meet up with each other with little overlan
(tigure 1), and it seems likely that they face similar environmental
conditions. In theory, genetic drift can be a powerful force in changing
allele trequencies, even in large populations, so long as the alleles are
selectively neutral and the time period in which change can occur is
