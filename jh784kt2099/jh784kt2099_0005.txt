ceriosus. The study area included the northern end of Tetrsclitss
range and the southern end of Semibalanus s, and encompassed at least
two potential barriers to gene flow: the Honterey Submarine Cangon
and Point Conception, the largest point on the west coast of N.
America.

Somple collection and storage Ouring the months of April and
Hag, 1990, collected samples of Tetraclite rubescens from jetties
in Port Heuneme, Horro Bag, Hoss Landing, and from a cerent wall in
Pacitic Grove (figure 1). Samples oi Semibalanus csriosus (Pallas.
1738), originallg mistaken for Tetraclita, were collected from a jettu
in Half Moon Bay. In all locations samples were collected throughout
the species' vertical intertidal range. In Pacific Grove the sampled
indiviquels ranged in size from verg small (2 mm basal diameter) to
verg large (50 mm basal diameter). in all other locations ! took onlu
medium to large individuals. I removed the soft tissue from all but
the smallest individuals (Amm besal diemeter or less) with tweezers
and stored each sample in an individual plastic centrifuge tube. The
smallest individuals were simply placed shell and all into individual
tubes. The samples from Half Hoon Bag, Horro Bag, and Port Huenere
were trozen in a cooler of dry ice immediatelg after sampling, and
then stored at -70 degrees C for the remainder of the project. The
