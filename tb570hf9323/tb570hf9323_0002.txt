Introduction
The work of Risebrough (Risebrough et al, 1967) and others
with chlorinated hydrocarbons in the marine ecosystem has
generated growing concern for the concentration and effect of
these pesticides in the world's oceans. The harmful effects of
DDT and its residues on marine birds has been a topic of much
discussion (Wurster and Wingate, 1968). Since the bird is at the
top of the marine food web and because DDT is passed on and
accumulated as it moves up the food chain, it would be expected
that this animal would be among the first organisms affected by
increasing concentrations of this hydrocarbon in the environment.
In order to study the relationship between DDT and the next
lower trophic level, the fishes, an extremely important pelagic
bait fish was chosen for this work. The Northern Anchovy is
abundant in California coastal waters and is the primary source
of food for most of California's game fish and a large number
of its coastal birds. In turn, this species is a voracious
omnivore, feeding extensively on phytoplankton and zooplankton.
Thousands of tons of anchovy are taken commercially each year
and used in various forms for human consumption and for raising
hatchery fish, poultry, and livestock. This fish is easily
obtainable, can be kept alive in captivity, and is of small size.
The study analysed ambient levels of p,p'-DDT (1,1,1-2-
2bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane) and its residues in 5 tissues of
the anchovy (gonad, liver, muscle, gill, and brain). The uptake
