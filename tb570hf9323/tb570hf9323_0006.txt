liver and 8.20 ppb in the brain for the h hour study. The feeding
experiment also showed approximately the same proportions among
the tissues except that the stomach tissues averaged 21.6612.86
per cent as compared to the l.671 1.20 per cent found in A stomachs
of fish run in the normal 1 ppb uptake experiments. Ten samples of
muscle from the same fish were run to determine accuracy of the
uptake technique. Results showed an average of 30.99 with a standard
deviation of+5.30.
Discussion
The results of the gas chromatography are slightly lower than
those found by Risebrough for Monterey Bay anchovies in November.
1965 (Risebrough, Menzel, Martin, and Olcott, unpublished results).
These analyses were of whole fish and averaged O.65 ppm with a
standard deviation of 0.19. However, the lipid content of the
Northern Anchovy fluctuates greatly during the year and is much
higher in November than in May, when the results of Table 1 were
determined. This is due to reproductive cycles and is significant
because the gas chromatographic method is based on lipid extraction.
The lipid content in the spring averages 7% as compared to an average
of 15% by weight in the fall (Parish, personal communication).
The uptake experiments showed high variation between individual
fish under constant conditions, as shown by the high standard
deviations for all tissues in Table 2. Much of the data on
pesticide residues is cited for a limited number of samples, often
