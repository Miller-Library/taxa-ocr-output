one or two, and the variability found in this study tends to show
that little confidence can be placed in small sample sizes where
DDT is concerned. Figure 1 shows the differences in 6 uptake
experiments.
Figure 2 shows the variations between sites of DDT concentration
in ambient levels and in uptake. This suggests that the DDT is
highly mobile within the anchovy after initial uptake. Liver tissue
was a site of heavy concentration in the uptake experiments, while
its value in ambient level is very low. The opposite is true in muscle
tissue, indicating that DDT residues seem to move from the liver
to muscle after uptake. There is also a positive indication
that the anchovy is capable of either metabolizing DDT or excreting
it directly. This conclusion comes from the extrapolation of the
15 ppt uptake results to the ambient levels in approximately 6 days.
The ambient level values for the processed oil and meal are significant
in that DDT residue concentration in the oil is above the Food and
Drug Administration's interstate trade limit of 5 ppm in products
for human consumption, and because the meal is fed directly to
animals intended for human consumption.
The results of the one feeding experiment are significant
in that the high stomach concentration shows feeding was taking
place and concentrations are again seen in liver, brain, and gill
tissue (in that order).
Further work is needed to determine the far-reaching effects
