Abstract
The ambient levels of DLE (approximately 80% of total DDT
residues) were determined in the Northern Anchovy from gas
chromatographic analysis of 25 samples of 6 different tissues:
female gonad, male gonad, liver, muscle, gill, and brain. Levels
were found to range between O.11 and 0.35 ppm by wet weight.
Direct uptake from sea water by live fish was measured with the
use of C+-labeled DDT for h hour incubations in 1 ppb concentrations.
Results showed very high concentrations of the DDT in liver, gill,
and brain. In h hours liver tissue concentrated DDT an average
of 240 times over the initial level, with gill and brain tissue
averaging 65 and 45 fold concentrations, respectively, in the
same time period. Results show large variations between individual
fish in amount and site of deposition. Comparison of normal
levels and uptake show that DDT is highly mobile within the fish
and seems to move from liver to muscle tissue after original
uptake.
