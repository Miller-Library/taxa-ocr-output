and deposition of C+DDT from sea water was investigated to relate
the normal levels and uptake results.
Materials and Methods
Specimens of E. mordax were taken from Monterey Bay and kept
in a large circular cement pool with a circulating current. The
sample was relatively homogeneous, consisting of about 300 fish
ranging from 150mm to 170mm standard length. They were mature
adults, estimated at 1-5 years. Frozen brine shrimp were given as
food each evening. Water temperatures in the pool ranged from
11C to 15Â°0. The fish survived with only low mortality after
adjustment to these conditions.
The gas chromatographic analysis was done with a Beckman GC h
gas-liquid chromatograph using a 3% OF 1 column on 80-100 mesh
chromosorb W and as elctron capture detector. The acid extraction
method of Stanley and LeFavoure (1965) was used to isolate the
pesticide. All chemicals were checked for possible pesticide
contamination. The glassware was carefully washed and then rinsed
with petroleum ether and nannograde hexane, and the last hexane
rinse was condensed and injected into the column to check for
contamination. The analysis itself was done on each of 6 tissues
from a group of 25 fish, except for the male and female gonads.
where only 15 fish were included in the samples. The results are
thus an average of the 25 and 15 fish samples, respectively. In
addition, samples of two anchovy products, oil and meal, were
obtained from a commercial plant processing Monterey Bay anchovy
3.
