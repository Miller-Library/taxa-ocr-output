catches. Only DDE was measured because the chromatograph was
unable to resolve DDT or DDD significantly and because DDE makes
up approximately 80% of the total DDT residues in the Northern
Anchovy (Risebrough, Menzel, Martin, and Olcott, unpublished
results).
The uptake experiments were conducted with fish chosen to
be approximately the same size (160mm). One fish was placed in
each one gallon screw-capped jar containing 2 liters of sea water
at 8 - 10 C. The sea water was aerated for thirty minutes before
each experiment. The radioactive DDT (100 ppm in ethanol) was then
added. For the bulk of these uptake experiments, 20ul of clppT
solution was added to each two liters of sea water to give a 1 ppb
concentration. The jars were kept tightly closed to prevent codistil-
lation of the radioactive DDT and were kept at 8Â°-10'C. It was
previously determined that the anchovies could only live from
A to 6 hours in this type of incubation, thus l hour limits were
placed on the incubations to insure that the fish would live
through the experiments. At the end of h hours, the fish were
killed and dissected. Six types of tissue were removed for
counting: the gonads, the liver, a portion of the muscle or flesh,
a portion of the skin, the gills, and the brain. Each tissue
was weighed and then homogenized in 2 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide.
One ml of this homogenate was pipetted into a scintillation vial
and 10 ml of toluene scintillation fluid (l gm PPO and O.1 gm
POPOP per liter) were added to each vial before counting on a
