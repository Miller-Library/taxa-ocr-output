Table 1. Ambient concentrations of DDE in Engraulis mordax Girard
as determined by gas chromatography. All tissues except male and
female gonads are averages of 25 fish samples. Gonad samples
included 15 fish.
Table 2. Results of CDDT uptake experiments with Engraulis mordax
Girard. Number of samples of each tissue in parenthesis. Incubations
were in 1 ppb concentrations for 4 hours in sea water at 8 -10 C.
Figure 1. Example of variations in uptake results at 1 ppb for
I hour incubations with Engraulis mordax Girard. Brain tissues
are open circles and liver tissues are closed circles. Both tissues
are from the same fish in each sample.
Figure 2. Comparison of ambient levels and uptake results as to
site of depostion in Engraulis mordax Girard. Uptake results (open
circles) are added to ambient levels (closed circles) to show
variations.
