of these results. The ambient levels must be determined throughout
the year in order to understand the relationship of DDT content to
lipid cycles. Further work is also needed on the movement of
pesticide residues within the anchovy, possible metabolism and
detoxification, and excretion back into the environment. This
study has shown the Northern Anchovy to be a link in the movement
of DDT and its residues in the marine food web.
