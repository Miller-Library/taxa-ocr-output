Nuclear-Chicago Unilux II two-channel scintillation counter. All
equipment which touched any tissues was rinsed twice with 952
ethanol between each tissue homogenization. Each vial was counted
for one minute and disintegrations per minute were converted into
parts per billion uptake for the h hour period. Variations in the
number of tissue samples are due to the use of other tissues at the
beginning of the study which were later standardized to the 6
listed above.
Three fish were also run at 15 ppt C+DDT under the same
conditions to simulate more closely the 15 ppt concentration found
in normal sea water as determined by the California Department of
Fish and Game (Odemar et al, 1968). One feeding experiment, with
fish, was run under the same conditions using frozen brine shrimp
which had been incubated in 10 ppb C+DDT for 1 hour and then
washed twice with sea water. This last experiment was not pursued
because results showed only very limited actual feeding due to the
excited state of the fish. Limitations on the size of containers
for the experiments were imposed by the problems of handling
vol√ºtile, radioactive materials.
Results
The results of the gas chromatography are listed in Table 1.
The results of the uptake experiments at 1 ppb for H hours are
listed in Table 2, with one standard deviation. The results of the
incubations in 15 ppt were in the same percentage proportions as
those of Table 2, with the highest values being 6.80 ppb in the
5.
