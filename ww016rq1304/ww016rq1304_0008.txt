Growth and Appearance of Thalli
Over the course of a month, there were several noticeable changes in
the appearance of Rhodymenia thalli in tanks with artificial seawater.
Although the thalli in the two tanks with natural seawater did not show any
visible differences in color or texture; thalli in all other tanks began to turn
green at the growing tips. The green tissue then slowly spread down the
thalli. This green tissue was much thinner and disintegrated easily when
touched. Consequently, the tissue samples which were weighed each week
remained constant or decreased in mass as the green tissue broke off of the
thalli (Fig. 1). As a result, there was little or no growth of thalli during the
course of the experiment.
At the end of the experiment, each tank was analyzed for percent of
thalli which had turned a sickly green (Fig. 2). It should be noted, however
that none of the algae was green at the beginning of the experiment. During
the course of the experiment, the dark and the pale thalli which had not yet
turned green became indistinguishable in color. The dark thalli's color faded
slightly so that it became the same shade as the pale thalli
Assays of Chlorophyll and R-Phycoerythrin Content
During the first four weeks, chlorophyll a levels all remained constant
at approximately 0.O6mg-g-1 fresh weight of tissue (Fig. 3). Data from dark
and pale thalli have been averaged in these figures unless otherwise noted.
