of new chlorophyll molecules (Collier, 1992). In the red alga Corallina
elongata, phycobiliprotein synthesis occurs under low irradiance only when
there is sufficient nitrogen present. Conditions of saturating irradiance and
limiting nitrogen resulted in degradation of the phycobilins (Vergara, 1993a).
In other work with Gelidium sesquipedale, Vergara (1993b) found that
phycobilins were an internal nitrogen reserve for the algae and that the
concentration of these pigments was related to ambient nitrate levels. It
should be noted that red algae are not capable of fixing elemental nitrogen,
they must obtain nitrogen in the form of nitrate (NÃ–3) or ammonium (NH4)
(Hanisak, 1983). Absorbed nitrate and ammonium are rapidly used once
absorbed; there is less than 1 umole-cm-3 in the cytosol of red algae (Reed
1990).
There are several phycobilins present in red algae; variation in the
relative amounts of each result in different thalli colors for different species.
In nearly all species, the phycobilins are abundant enough that they mask the
presence of chlorophyll a. Unlike chlorophyll, however, these pigments are
water soluble and are attached to a protein; thus the name a phycobiliprotein.
These are grouped together as phycobilisomes on the outer surfaces of the
thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts (Bold & Wynne, 1978).
During El Nifio years, it has been observed that Rhodymenia pacifica
in shallow (7m) water changes from its deep red hue into a sickly yellow (J.
Watanabe, personal comm.). El Nifio conditions result when the nutrient
poor ocean surface layer is deeper than usual; thus when upwelling occurs,
only the surface water is recirculated. This results in warmer, nutrient poor
water along the California coast. El Nifios occur approximately every five
