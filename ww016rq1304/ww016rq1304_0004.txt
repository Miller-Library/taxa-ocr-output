years, so this phenomenon is very significant in the life cycles of most marine
organisms.
Thus, the primary purpose of this experiment was to determine
whether bleaching of Rhodymenia thalli occurred as a response to nitrate
limitation or as a response to other factors, including increased temperature
and/or light. In particular, by maintaining water at the same temperature as
ambient seawater and giving the thalli sufficient light, the effects due to
nitrate stress alone could be measured.
Rhodymenia is a slow growing subtidal red algae which is common off
the coast of Central California. Thalli of this species grow to several
centimeters in length, and by the end of the summer they are overgrown
with small invertebrates such as bryozoans and polychaetes. Rhodymenia
grows in large clusters attached to rocks on the ocean floor. Rhodymenia
thalli were collected and then grown in artificial seawater with differing
amounts of nitrate so that the concentration of phycobilins over time could
be determined through simple extractions of the pigments. The most
abundant phycobiliprotein by far in Rhodymenia is R-phycoerythrin; thus,
the levels of this pigment were tracked over time. By measuring factors such
as chlorophyll content, growth, and percent carbon and nitrogen, as well as R
phycoerythrin over the course of a month, it was hoped that trends in some
or all of these would become apparent as thalli were subjected to varying
levels of dissolved nitrate.
