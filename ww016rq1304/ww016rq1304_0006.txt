analysis. All tanks were immersed in ambient-temperature running natural
seawater; this ensured that the tanks' water temperature was never more
than 2°C higher than the surrounding water, which varied from 12 to 13°C.
The artificial seawater was changed every four to five days, with nitrate added
daily. The average nitrate uptake rate was estimated to be half of the Vmax
for Gracilaria, a red algae, from Hanisak (1983), and all nitrate in a tank was
assumed to have been used in twenty-four hours. These rates were used to
estimate quantities of nitrate that were required to maintain the desired
experimental conditions. Each morning, nitrate was added to tanks so that
the initial concentrations were 40 uM or 20 uM. Thus, the daily average
concentrations were 20 uM or 10 uM. Small air stones were placed inside
each tank to maintain adequate mixing of the water. Shade cloth was placed
on top of all of the tanks so that the maximum light intensity that the algae
experienced was not more than 400 uEm-2s-1, which is slightly lower than the
maximum light intensity at 10m deep over the past three years at HMLR
(Watanabe & Phillips, unpubl. data). Most thalli in the tanks had small
amounts of fouling organisms growing on them; sections of the thalli with
these organisms were not used in any of the procedures listed in the
following sections.
Extraction of Pigments
Tissue samples were taken weekly from each tank and analyzed for
chlorophyll and phycobiliprotein content in the following manner. For
chlorophyll extractions, approximately 1.5g of tissue was frozen in liquid
nitrogen, ground in a mortar and pestle, and then ground for ten to fifteen
minutes in a ground glass tissue grinder with 4ml acetone. The resulting
mixture was spun until the supernatant was no longer cloudy. It was
