calculations, this would explain the lowered phycobilin levels in all of the
artificial seawater treatments. It is surprising, however, that even the thalli
in natural seawater showed decreased phycobilin levels over time.
Because all tissue samples that were weighed weekly remained
constant or decreased in mass, the algae must have been under some degree
of stress; although the tissue grows slowly, some increase in mass would have
been expected. Stress was also obvious from the thalli which were turning
green. This change in tissue was similar to the normal changes of nitrate
deprivation; in the ocean thalli become blotched with green or yellow tissue,
and in this experiment the tissue became green and disintegrated very easily.
Green sections had, obviously, little or no detectable phycobilins. In the
natural seawater tanks there was little green tissue; this suggests that the
thalli were not stressed to the same degree as those in the artificial seawater.
Possibilities include nitrate stress as well as the lack of another nutrient
needed for algal growth, since green tissue appeared in much larger quantities
in the artificial seawater tanks. However, there is no straightforward way to
determine what exactly was different in the artificial seawater without further
experimentation.
The significant increase in percent carbon among weeks is consistent
with algae which are nitrogen limited (Hanisak 1983). However, it is not
known if the additional carbon was incorporated into carbohydrates or used
for producing new structural tissue. When the measured growth rates are
considered (Fig. 1), it becomes clear that the thalli were deteriorating, not
growing. Thus, the increase in carbon was most likely incorporated into
carbohydrates. All of these factors discussed demonstrate that, under
