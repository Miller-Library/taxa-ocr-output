Abstract
The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there is a
relationship between lowered nitrate levels in seawater and subsequent
degradation of phycobilins in Rhodymenia pacifica when grown under
adequate light. Phycobilins, accessory photosynthetic pigments, are often
degraded under nitrate stress because of their high nitrogen content. In this
experiment, the subtidal red alga R. pacifica was placed in tanks of artificial
seawater with varying nitrate concentrations (0, 10, and 20 uM), and the
phycobilin levels of these thalli were traced over five weeks. Phycobilin
levels in the thalli in all treatments decreased significantly among weeks and
treatments. Thalli given no nitrate had lower phycobilin levels than the 10
and 20 uM treatments, whose levels decreased at approximately the same rate.
Additional thalli were grown in natural seawater with identical experimental
conditions; their phycobilin levels decreased less markedly over time. All
thalli except for those in natural seawater began to turn green at their tips
after approximately two weeks; this green tissue was very weak and degraded
when it was touched. Chlorophyll a levels of all samples remained constant
throughout the experiment, and there was no growth of any thalli.
Elemental analysis of the tissues was performed; there was a significant
increase in percent carbon in all treatments over time, but no significant
changes in percent nitrogen. In conclusion, there is a definite trend which
shows that decreased nitrate concentrations do lower phycobilin
concentrations over time. However, there presence of green thalli tissue
suggests that there may have been other factors involved as well.
