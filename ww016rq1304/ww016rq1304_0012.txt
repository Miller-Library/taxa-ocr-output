sufficient light and limiting nitrate, phycobilin levels in Rhodymenia pacifica

will decrease. Thus, during an El Nino, at least part of the observed
phycobilin decrease is due to these conditions.
Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my advisor, Jim Watanabe, for advice on my
project throughout the quarter. Special thanks goes to the Monterey Bay
Aquarium, in particular Roger Phillips, for his support as well as the use of
his lab space, spectrophotometer, elemental analyzer. Deb Robertsonâ€™s
insights on experimental design and pigment extraction were of great help to
me. Stuart Thompson was kind enough to let me use his lab for the
preparation of the artificial seawater. In conclusion, I am grateful to all those
who went diving with me to collect the Rhodymenia.
