analyzed in a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer, and the
concentration of chlorophyll was determined according to Jeffrey and
Humphrey (1975). Phycobiliproteins were extracted from 0.25 g of tissue and
then frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a mortar and pestle, and then
ground with 4ml of O.1M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 until no color remained in
the tissue fragments. Concentration of R-phycoerythrin, the main
phycobiliprotein in Rhodymenia, was determined from absorption data from
the spectrophotometer (Lobban et al, 1988; Beer & Eschel, 1985). After several
weeks, it became clear that pigment loss was occurring mostly at the tips of
the thalli, rather than uniformly across the thalli. Thus, samples for week
four were taken specifically from the tips.
Other Procedures
One plant from each tank was tagged and its blotted wet mass was
taken weekly to determine growth rates. At the end of the month, the
condition of all remaining thalli was determined by estimating by eye the
percent of algae which had turned from a thick, deep red into a thin, sickly
green in each tank. This was to provide an independent measurement of the
degradation of phycobilins by Rhodymenia. At weeks zero, two, and four,
one to two grams of tissue were dried overnight at 60’C, ground, and placed in
a Leeman Labs 240XA elemental analyzer to determine the percent
composition of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen for each sample.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed by a two-way ANÖVA with time and NO3
concentration as fixed factors.
