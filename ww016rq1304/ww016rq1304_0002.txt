Introduction
This experiment examined the relationship between phycobilin
concentration in Rhodymenia pacifica, a red algae, with nitrate levels in the
ambient seawater. Nitrogen and light intensity are the two limiting factors
for algal growth in the ocean. When nitrate concentration of the ambient
water is low, both cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and red algae are faced with
a tradeoff. If the light intensity is very low, the algae need all of their
phycobilins to capture enough light for photosynthesis so that they may
survive. However, if the light intensity is strong enough, the algae can
afford to degrade some of their phycobilins, which are nitrogen rich accessory
photosynthetic pigments. Nitrogen from the phycobilins is used in other
metabolic functions, such as growth and regulating enzymes involved in
photosynthesis (Hanisak, 1983). Because the main absorbance ranges of
phycobilins are in regions of light where chlorophyll cannot absorb, the
degradation of these pigments affects the thallus' ability to use those other
wavelengths (Gannt, 1990). The degradation of phycobilins causes the tissue
to change from a deep red or blue-green (for red algae and cyanobacteria,
respectively) into either a lighter red-yellow or a light green-yellow,
depending on the species and the level of nitrate stress (Collier, 1992)
Several studies of cyanobacteria and red algae have examined the
effects of nitrate stress. When the cyanobacterium Synechococcus was
deprived of nitrogen, it rapidly turned to a bleached yellow as its phycobilins
were degraded. Cell growth slowed dramatically, and there was no synthesis
