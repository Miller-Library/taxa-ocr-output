Discussion
Ambient nitrate levels and sufficient light affect the concentration of
phycobilins in the thalli of Rhodymenia pacifica (Fig. 4). It is clear that,
under reduced nitrate, their phycobilin concentration decreases. Those thalli
which did not receive any nitrate at all had the lowest levels by the end of the
experiment. This suggests that the bleaching in R. pacifica observed during
El Ninnos is at least partly caused by breakdown of phycobilins in response to
lowered ambient nitrate levels with sufficient light. Thalli which were pale
at the beginning of the experiment demonstrated this the most. Due to their
initial lower phycobilin levels, they must have been much more susceptible
to decreased nitrate concentrations. The dramatic decrease in pigment levels
suggests that they were being degraded very rapidly in the thalli to obtain the
nitrogen for needed metabolic functions.
However, why the thalli in 10 and 20 uM NÃ–3 treatments had similar
phycobilin concentrations throughout the experiment is unclear.
Rhodymenia may absorb nitrate from the water at a faster rate than
estimated; thus both treatments may have been nitrate stressed. Nitrate was
added daily, and it is possible that the thalli absorbed it so quickly that after a
few hours no nitrate was left in the water. Water samples taken twenty-four
hours after nitrate was added were frozen and will be analyzed. Results from
these samples will demonstrate if all the nitrate was absorbed each day or not.
If Rhodymenia absorb nitrate faster than expected from the original nitrate
