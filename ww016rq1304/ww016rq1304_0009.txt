There were no significant differences, neither among nitrate treatments nor
among weeks (ANÖVA, p».62).
R-Phycoerythrin levels did change over the course of the experiment.
Initially, the dark tissue had more pigments than the pale colored tissue (1.95
vs 1.41 mg/g fresh weight). However, concentrations in all thalli decreased,
including those in the natural seawater (Fig 4). There were significant
differences between the nitrate treatments as well as between the weeks
(Pk.005). Samples harvested from the ocean at the end of the experiment
had nearly identical phycobilin levels to those obtained initially (dark thalli
had an average of 2.025 mg/g wt, and pale an average of 1.597 mg/g wt).
Thus, there was no similar ocean trend, for either the pale or the dark thalli.
Composition of Algal Tissue
The percentage of carbon in the thalli gradually increased over the
month of the experiment (Fig 5). ANOVA results indicated that there was a
significant difference between weeks (Pk.05), but not between nitrate
treatments. Samples taken from the ocean at the end of the experiment had
similar percent composition to those taken at the start, for both carbon and
nitrogen (24.36% carbon for dark and 22.99% for pale thalli; 2.955% nitrogen
for dark and 2.805% for pale thalli).
Levels of nitrogen in the thalli did not change significantly during the
experiment, either between weeks or treatments (Fig. 6). However, when the
pale tissue is examined separately, it is obvious that the thalli in the 20 uM
NO3 treatment increased in percent nitrogen, while that in the 0 uM NO3
tanks hardly increased at all (Fig 7). Although this difference was not
