Rhodymenia pacifica thalli were placed in twelve clear plastic tanks
" and these tanks were
which had base dimensions of approximately 13",
covered with clear thin plastic sheets. Each tank contained approximately
twenty grams wet weight of thalli, immersed in three liters of either artificial
seawater with one of three known concentrations of nitrate (0, 10, 20 uM) or
natural seawater with ambient levels of nitrate (approx. 20 uM). There were
two replicates per treatment.
Thalli were collected during April 1994 by using SCÜBA at depths of
6.5m (referred to as "pale") and 10m ("dark") from the Hopkins Marine Life
Refuge (HMLR) in Pacific Grove, CA. There was a slight but noticeable
difference in the colors of the thalli at different depths; shallow (pale)
specimens were a lighter red than their deeper (dark) counterparts. Thus,
these were placed in separate tanks. Dark thalli were placed in tanks with 0,
10, and 20 uM NÖg as well as in natural seawater. Pale thalli were placed in
tanks with 0 or 20 uM NO3. The artificial seawater was made from Sigma’s
Sea Salts and Provasoli’s enrichment solution (Carolina Biological Supply,
Technical Report). At the end of the month, additional thalli were harvested
from 6.5m and 10m at approximately the same locations as experimental
thalli to determine their pigment concentrations. During the spring, ambient
levels at the HMLR range from 20 to 25 uM NO3 (Watanabe & Phillips,
unpubl. data). Three times, prior to daily addition of nitrate, water samples
were taken from selected experimental tanks and frozen for later nitrate
