Wu: Pedal Locomotion
A. Muscle Systems
The two major muscle systems involved in locomotion are
the parieto-basilar and endocoelic parietals (Batham and Pantin,
1951). The parieto-basilars provide horizontal to diagonal lines
of stress along a mesentery. This muscle system runs from the :
pedal disc to the lower half of the body walland are found exocoel¬
ically in perfect and imperfect mesenteries. The parietals
provide vertical stress lines within a mesentery. Kunning
from the pedal disc to the body wall, parietals exist in the
endocoel of microcnemes (Fig.3).
Other possible minor contributers are the retractors and
the longitudinal muscles of mesenteries (Fig. 4).
B. Musculature During Locomotion
From my observations,I believe almost all muscle
related activity occurs in the mesenteries other than some
contraction of the circular muscles of the column.
Initiation of a wave is accomplished by the parieto¬
basilars drawing in the back edge while the parietals simul-
taneously lift the back portion of the pedal disc off the substrate
(Fig. c). The furrows of detachment and contraction that develop
are due mainly to the parietals contracting and the parieto¬
basilars contributing (Fig 5d).
These furrows are able to propagate around the edge
of the disc by progressing from one mesentery to another.
Analysis of the Videotapes supports this theory as the furrows
move through the visible attachment lines of successive mesenteries
