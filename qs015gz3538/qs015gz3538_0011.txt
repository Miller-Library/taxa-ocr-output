I would like to thank everyone at Hopkins Marine
Station, particularly Freya Sommers, and Chuck Baxter for
his invaluable guidance and assistance. A special thanks
to Mark Shelley and Alex Edwards of Monterey Bay Aquarium
for their time, energy and generosity in allowing me to use
the time lapse photography equipment.
