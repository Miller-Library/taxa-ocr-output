Wu: Pedal Locomotion
to the leading edge of its final position. Wave velocity was
measured as the wave travelled across the latter half of the disc
where it was easier to follow. Only the number of complete
waves crossing thepedal disc were tabulated. Some waves
would travel across the disc then die out upon nearing the
leading edge.

A. Pedal Wave
Pedal locomotion of Anthopleura elegantissima involves
monotaxic, direct waves. Waves originate at the point of
stimulus and travel across the disc to the leading edge.
The posterior portion of the pedal disc is sectioned into
lobes by radial furrows running along mesenteric lines.
These furrows are areas of contraction and detachment from the
substrate (Fig. 1a). As one wave would near completion (Fig. ib).
another wave would begin by detaching the back edge and drawing
its pedal disc away from the eolid feeding site. Furrows
associated with mesentaries begin to deepen and enlarge. As
the wave continues to progress, these furrows travel around
the edge of the pedal disc becoming a moving wave, and extending
toward the center of the disc (Fig. 1c. d).
At approximately halfway across the disc (in the direction
of locomotion), the furrows become a complete, propagating,
direct, monotaxic wave (Fig. le). The wave maintains its
