Wu: Pedal Locomotion
I. Introduction
Although anemones have been known to locomote for well
over, a hundred years (Gosse 1860), no detailed analysis of
pedal locomotion exists. Furthermore, the majority of the
works relating to locomotion have been conducted with the anemone
Metridium senile. Almost no work has concentrated on Anthopleura
elegantissima except for a brief mention in Edmunds et al
(1976).
Some of the earlier accounts of pedal locomotion can
be found in Parker (1917) for Metridium marginatum, Sagartia luciae,
Condylactis passiflora and Actinia bermudensis. Additional
accounts using Metridium senile are from Batham and Pantin (1951),
Pantin (1952) and Robson (1976).
In this study, the pedal locomotion of Anthopleura
elegantissima was studied to provide a detailed description
of the development and progression of the locomotory waves.
Aeolidia papillosa was used as stimulus for the anemones.
Videotaping, in both real time and time lapse, was employed as
well as simple observation.
Questions examined during this study included a detailed
description of the mechanics of the pedal waves, the temporal
characteristics of the waves and the correlation of movements
on the column with that of the pedal disc, to arrive at an
explanation of the muscles involved in locomotion.
