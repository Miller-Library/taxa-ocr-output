Wu: Pedal Locomotion
II. Materials and Methods
The experiments were conducted at the Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey.
Both Anthopleura elegantissima and Aeolidia papillosa used were
collected from wharf +2 in Monterey. Anemones and nudibranchs
were held for approximately seven weeks in 13Â°c runningsea water.
Aeolidia were kept submerged in three feet ofses water to cure
and prevent bubble disease. Feeding was intermittent. Only
animals that had been without food for at least 24 hrs. were
used in experiments. Twenty-four hours without food normally
elicits predatory behavior in Aeoldia (cited in Edmunds et al,
1976). Sizes of anemones ranged form 1-3cmacross the
oral disc.
A. Observation
Simple observation of anemones attached to the wall of
a glass tank was employed initially. An eolid was introduced
until contact was initiated and feeding began. Only eolids
of comparable size to anemones were used. Anemone locomotion
or detachment would follow.
B. Time Lapse
Time lapse was conducted at the Monterey Bay Aquarium
with a Betacam recorder video camera. Footage was analyzed
on a Panasonic Omnivision II VHS videotape system which
allowed stop frame, slow speed and normal speed (30 frames/sec)
