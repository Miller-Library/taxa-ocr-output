Wu: Pedal Locomotion
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1: Sequence of pedal wave outlines during locomotion.
The two major muscle systems associated with
Figure 2:
locomotion. Taken from Batham and Pantin (1951)
for Metridium senile.
Figure 3:
Musculature of a perfect mesentery. Other muscle
systems which may have minor involvement in locomotion--
longitudinal, retractors and circular. Taken from
Batham and Pantin (1951) for Metridium senile.
Figure 4:
Movement of the column during locomotion as it
relates to the pedal wave. Anemone was stimulated
by Aeolidia papillosa.
Figure 5:
Mesentery musculature during locomotion. a) Top viey
of mesenteries. b) Cross-section of a mesentery, c)
wave
beginning as shown in one mesentery. Parietals and
parieto-basilars contract. d) Deepening furrows through
contraction of parietals and parieto-basilar.
e) View of one half of pedal disc. Perfect mesentery
contracting muscies along vertical axis. f) Section
of pedal disc showing three simplified mesenteries.
g) Cross section of mesentery with edge of column
folded under. Contraction of parieto-basilars
combined with hydrost√•tic pressure flip folded under
portion back out.
