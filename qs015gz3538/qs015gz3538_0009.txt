Wu: Pedal Locomotion
In addition, the creases or lowered oral disc above the wave
(Fig2d-f) indicate involvement of the mesenteric longitu -
dinal muscles. During a wave, a narrow band of contraction
running vertically up the side of the column from the fold at
the disc perimeter probably results from both the parietals
and parieto-basilars creating a line of tension between column
and pedal disc.
The appearance of a distinct wave approximately half¬
way across the disc could be due to two perfect mesentaries
contracting their parietal muscles; each situated opposite
the other along a radial axis (Fig. 5e).
For the wave to maintain its definition as it progresses
forward through radially arranged mesenteries, isolated con¬
tractions of the fibres in both the parietal and parieto¬
basilar muscle seem necessary (Fig. 5f). These muscle fibers
would be in the mesenteries situated at angles perpendicular
to the wave. A cinched in contortion appears and passes
down the column as the wave approaches the leading edge.
This appearance would seem to indicate a contraction of the
parieto-basilar muscles propagating the wave across the pedal
disc (Fig. 2f, Fig. 5e).
As the wave nears competion it becomes a sharp crease,
a result of two processes: 1) the excess pedal discmaterial
being pushed up against the momentarily stationery leading
edge, and 2), the leaning forward and folding under of the column.
