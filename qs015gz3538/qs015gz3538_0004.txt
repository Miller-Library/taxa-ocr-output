Wu: Pedal Locomotion
viewing. One frame was taken every 1.89sec. Filming duration
ranged from 1-2hrs. Anemones were attached to the tank wall
or a glass plate and then positioned vertically for filming.
Filming took place in sea water at room temperature (20°:c)
and 14-15°C. Fiber optic lights were employed to reduce
heat transfer. All anemones were stimulate by Aeolidia as
explained earlier.
C. Real Time
A Panasonic VHS video recorder was used for filming in real
time. Anemones were attached to the vertical walls of small plex¬
iglass tanks. Temperature of the sea water during recording
was approximately 17°C. Anemones were stimulated by Aeolidia.
D. Locomotion of Anemones Without Oral Disc
The oral disc of the anemone was cut off using a pair
of surgical scissors. A. elegantissima were allowed to recuperate
for approximately 24hrs. Filming conditions were similiar
to real time recording. stimulus provided by Aeolidia.
E. Quantitative Data
Data were gathered from approimately 30 anemones.
Not all data were collected from each anemone, that is,
only anemone velogity was collected from some anemones while
others provide a complete data set. Anemone velocity was measured
from the leading edge of the anemone in its original position
