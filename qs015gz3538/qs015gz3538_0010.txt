Wu: Pedal Locomotion
10
Additional observations I made include experiments conducted
upon anemones which had their oral discs removed. These
anemones, when stimulated by Aeolidia, locomoted normally.
This observation agrees with the view that the pedal disc
and agacent parts contain all the neuromuscular mechanisms
needed for locomotion (Parker, 1917). Decapitation would
not affect the parietal and parieto-basilar muscles since
they are attached to the body wall.
I also noticed a reduction of the pedal disc area
before locomoting in anemones which had their pedal discs
spread out. Waves would be initiated and propagate as far
as the front portion of the pedal disc but then stopped.
This is probably associated with contraction of the circular
muscles of the pedal disc to reduce its area.
Further work is clearly indicated to clarify the two
previously mentioned behavioral responses. A detailed analysis
of the musculature of A. elegantissima especially during loÂ¬
comotion would greatly contribute to our understanding of
pedal locomotion. Questions such as, why is the manner of
propagation seemingly different in the beginning compared to
the end of a wave and, what manner of nervous activity is involved,
remain unanswered.
