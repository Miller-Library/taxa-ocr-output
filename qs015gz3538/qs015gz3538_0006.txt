Wu: Pedal Locomotion
definition as it travels across the remainder of the disc,
usually with a slight convexity viewed from the anterior
(Fig. 1f,g). Just before the leading edge, the anterior
edge of the wave stops and the posterior catches up and forms
a crease (Fig. 1h). The column around the leading edge is
folded Junder slightly in front of this crease. This folded
under portion is flipped out in the final pedal wave sequence.
B. Quantitative Data
All quantitative data are summarized in Table 1.
A similiar "range of variability in each set of data was
found for each anemone as well as for the entire experimental
group; no conclusive correlation existed between size and velocity,
movement forward/wave, etc.
C. Movement of the Column during Locomotion
Upon initial contact with Aeolidia, Anthopleura
would lean towards the eolid with tentacles expanded. But
as Aeolidia began feeding, the tentacles were withdrawn
slightly and the oral disc contracted down. The anemone
soon assumed its original position. The posterior edge
inflated and the column moved away from the eolid (Fig. 2a).
During the course of a pedal wave the column experiences
several peristaltic-like waves passing up and down the column;
no conclusive correlations could be made to events in the
pedal disc.
