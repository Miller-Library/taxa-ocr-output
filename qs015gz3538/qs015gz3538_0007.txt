Wu: Pedal Locomotion
Initiation of the wave began as the back edge was simul¬
taneously detached from the substrate and pulled forward
toward the leading edge (Fig. 2b). Reattachment occured
as the back edge gradually came back into contact with the
substrate (Fig. 2c). The wave continues around the posterior
pedal disc perimeter as a small fold. Accompanying the appearance
of this fold is a lowering of the oral disc located above the
wave (Fig. 2d). As the wave becomes a well defined band across
the pedal disc, the oral disc above the back edge was raised
and a crease was evident in the oral disc (Fig. 2e). Con¬
tinuation of the pedal wave involves a constriction of the
lower half of the column, especially near the leading edge
(Fig 2f). The anemone begins to lean forward; the column
bulges out above the leading edge and gradually makes contact
with the substrate (Fig. 2g), folding under in the process.
A slight downward contraction of the entire oral disc coincides
with this folded pertion being flipped, out as a circumfer¬
ential wave (Fig.2h).
IV. Discussion
Thus far, the anemone has been Viewed as jeparate elements¬
the pedal disc and column. By correlating the movements of
the column to the pedal disc, an attempt at an analysis of the
musculature involved is possible. The muscle systems will
be generalized from the literature but the studies were
largely done one Metridium (Batham and Pantin, 1951).
