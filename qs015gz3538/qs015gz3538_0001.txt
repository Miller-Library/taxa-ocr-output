Wu: Pedal Locomotion
ABSTRACT
Videotapes, both in real time and time lapse, were
made of moving anemones stimulated by Aeolidia papillosa.
Close analysis of the videotapes provided a detailed descripÂ¬
tion of the development and progression of locomotory pedal
waves in Anthopleura elegantissima. The mean velocity of
all anemones studied was 13.6 mm/hr. A correlation between
the movements on the column with that of the pedal disc during
locomotion provides a basis for the explanation of muscular
systems involved.
