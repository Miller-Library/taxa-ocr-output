Previous research has studied cardiac function, enzyme biochemistry, and gene expression as
factors that have led to <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>M. galloprovincialis'</span> successful invasion. Enzyme biochemistry,
however, has only been studied in the laboratory, using specimens acclimated to common
conditions. The objective of my study was to gain an accurate depiction of potential for
metabolic function in field-acclimatized congeners of blue mussels collected from a site where
both species and their hybrids occur. Estimates of potential metabolic rate were obtained by
assaying the activity of two enzymes that are important in ATP production: malate
dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS). Specimens were collected from Bodega Bay
harbor, genotyped to their respected species (including hybrids), and enzyme assays were
conducted. <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>M. trossulus</span> had a significantly higher activity for both MDH and CS, relative to M.
galloprovincialis (one-way ANOVA tests). The hybrids' MDH and CS activities fell between
those of M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis. To determine if size-dependence (“scaling") of
metabolic rate contributed to these differences, I used linear regression analysis to determine the
relationship between body size (length of shell) and enzymatic activity. When all genotypes'
MDH and CS activities and mussel size were compared, a significant negative correlation was
evident. When the species were analyzed separately, however, the correlations were not
significant. The higher activities of MDH and CS in M. trossulus are consistent with this
congener being more cold-adapted (able to sustain a high metabolic rate at low temperatures)
than the Mediterranean invasive. Furthermore, the hybrids are adapted to both warm and cold
water, and can survive in a middle climate range. These data correlate to the mapped
distributions of the genotypes along the California coast and to the previous knowledge of the
physiological differences between the species.
INTRODUCTION:
Coastal marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to introduced, invasive species which
can compete with native species. This is due to the constant movement of water and organisms
between habitats, ranging far along the coastline, as well as the high rates of translocation -
frequently due to the ballast water of ocean vessels (Fields et al., 2006). This constant travel of
ocean vessels allows repeated opportunities for colonization; many times, the introduced species
is able to successfully compete with the native species in the area. There are many reasons why
some introduced organisms have the ability to successfully compete with native species
(Dahlhoff, 2004). Here, we explore pre-existing physiological suitability as the cause for
successful invasion, through temperature adaptations. The mechanism of invasive success was
examined through comparing enzyme activities of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate
synthase (CS) from two mussel congeners and their hybrids. The mussels studied were Mytilus
trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis.
Both Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis are part of the ’blue mussel’
complex, which, along with <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus edulis : Exact'>Mytilus edulis,</span> comprises three quarters of the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus : Exact'>Mytilus</span> genus. The
four congeners of the Mytilus genus are the three blue mussels, and one ribbed mussel, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>Mytilus
californianus</span> (McDonald and Koehn, 1988). The three blue mussels are morphologically
similar, and the species cannot be distinguished without genetic analysis.
Before 1988, it was thought that the only Mytilus mussels that were present on the west
coast of North America were <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>M. edulis</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>M. californianus</span> (Braby and Somero, 2006b).
However, it was then determined in 1988 that there in fact was no M. edulis and instead there
were M. trossulus, M. galloprovincialis, and M. californianus. This discovery was made through
allozyme analysis and then later confirmed with mitochondrial DNA haplotyping (McDonald
and Koehn, 1988). When this discovery was made, more research began looking into the
distributions of the blue mussels. It was discovered that M. galloprovincialis, native to the
Mediterranean Sea, had replaced the native blue mussel, M. trossulus, over much of its range
(Suchanek, 1997). When M. galloprovincialis was introduced to southern California less than a
century ago, it was able to successfully outcompete M. trossulus and completely displace them in
many regions. Their slow invasion northward led to the current hybrid zone in northern
California, which extends from Monterey Bay, California, to Cape Mendocino, California
(Rawson et al., 1999). In the hybrid zone, M. trossulus, M. galloprovincialis, and their hybrids
are found, while north of the zone, only M. trossulus are present and south of the zone, only M.
galloprovincialis are found (Bierne et al., 2003).
At present times and in their native ranges, M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis inhabit
very different habitats with different physicochemical attributes. In the northeaster Pacific, M.
trossulus is found in bays and rocky intertidal habitats. In this habitat range, individuals are
exposed to cool waters and, especially during winter rainy periods, to low salinity environments.
M. galloprovincialis, however, is native to the warm and more saline waters of the
Mediterranean Sea (Fields et al., 2006).
It has been suggested that differences in temperature adaptation may account for the
successful invasion and the formation of the current hybrid zone. There have been many
physiological studies which support this idea. Cardiac function has been studied by Braby and
Somero (2006b) who found differences in basal heart rate, as well as the temperatures at which
heart-beat was inhibited. These differences support the hypothesis that M. trossulus is adapted to
lower temperatures than M. galloprovincialis. Furthermore, Hofmann and Somero (1996) found
significant differences between the induction temperatures of the heat-shock response. M.
trossulus had a significantly lower temperature at which heat-shock proteins were synthesized,
and these data, too, are consistent with M. trossulus being a more cold-adapted species.
More recently, research has been conducted on the enzyme biochemistry of the two
species. Both Fields et al. (2006) and an acclimation study by Lockwood (unpublished) show
higher enzyme activities in M. trossulus. This suggests that they are more cold-adapted than M.
galloprovincialis because they are able to maintain normal enzymatic function even at low
temperatures. While results of these laboratory acclimation studies agree with previous research
and conclusions, data obtained from in-lab acclimation studies may not necessarily resemble data
obtained from the field.
This uncertainty is what prompted the overall question for my study: Do enzymatic
activity rates in field-acclimatized M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis from a common habitat
exhibit the same type of variation found in laboratory acclimation experiments? Because these
two species are able to hybridize, I also examined hybrids to determine how their enzymatic
activities compared with those of the pure species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of specimens
Blue mussel specimens were obtained from an intertidal beach located on the outer
region of Bodega Bay, CA (38°19’28"N, 123°2'19"W). Bodega Bay was selected as the
collection point due to a 2006 survey that revealed a fairly equal abundance of M. trossulus and
M. galloprovincialis and the presence of hybrids (Braby and Somero, 2006a). Specimens were
collected during a midday low tide on April 16, 2008. Samples were obtained from crevices in
rocks and from mud burrows. A wide size range of specimens was collected. The mussels were
immediately put on dry ice and brought back to Hopkins Marine Station, where they were stored
at -80’C until used for experimentation.
Preparation of the tissues
For the enzyme assays, only the adductor muscle was used, as it provided abundant tissue
for homogenate preparation. For genotyping, the foot was used. The mussels were removed
from the freezer, put on an iced dissection tray, measured (height, length, and width), and then
cut open. The two tissues were scraped free from contamination with other tissues, and then cut
out. The tissues were put in foil on ice, and the foot was placed back in the freezer for later
genotyping. The adductor muscle was used immediately to produce tissue homogenates for the
enzyme assays.
In preparation of the tissue homogenates, the adductor muscle samples were weighed,
and then placed back into the foil on ice. Using the masses, I determined the amount of
homogenization buffer (5OmM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8) needed to produce a 10-fold
diluted homogenate for each sample. If the total volume of homogenization buffer was under 0.5
ml, however, a 20-fold dilution of the tissue was used.
The appropriate volume of chilled buffer was put in a homogenizer. The tissue sample
was first minced with a sterilized scalpel, and then added to the homogenizer. The pestle was
then inserted and the sample was homogenized for several minutes, until the suspension was
sufficiently homogenous.
Next, the homogenate was transferred into a 2 ml microfuge tube and centrifuged for 5
min at 14,000 rpm at 4’C. The supernatant was then pipetted off and placed in a new microfuge
tube, which was kept on ice until it was used for the enzyme assays.
Genotyping
The procedure used for determining the genotype of each specimen followed the protocol
of Braby and Somero (2006a). First, DNA was isolated using membrane spin columns
(Macherey-Nagel, Nucleospin^ DNA extraction kit). Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
methods were used with 1 ul of template DNA, to amplify two nuclear loci. Both Glu-5, a
byssal thread protein locus, and ITS, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region were used,
as each species has a different sized fragment at each of these loci.
At the Glu-5 locus, M. galloprovincialis has a fragment size of 300 bp, while M.
trossulus has a fragment size of 240 bp. A hybrid between these species contains both
fragments. I used the published primers, slightly modified PCR chemistry (25 ul reaction
volume with 16.40 ul H2O, 2.5 ul Coral Load Buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1.25 ul each of
10 uM primer 1 (FWR) and 10 uM primer 2 (REV), 2.5 ul dNTP mix (mM), 0.1 ul Taq
polymerase, and 1.0 ul template DNA), and slightly modified cycling conditions (initial
denaturation of 1.5 min at 94°C; 25 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 53°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s;
final extension of 2 min at 72'C, and then left at 14'C) to get my PCR product (Braby and
Somero, 2006a).
The ITS locus amplifies a-950 bp sized fragment for both species, but after a restriction
digest using Hhal restriction enzyme, M. galloprovincialis has a fragment length of 450 bp,
while M. trossulus has a fragment length of 280 bp; the hybrid exhibits both fragments. Tused
the published primers, slightly modified PCR chemistry (50 ul reaction volume with 33.8 ul
H2O, 5.0 ul 1Ox buffer, 2.5 ul each of 10 uM primer 1 (FWR) and 10 uM primer 2 (REV), 5 ul
dNTP mix (mM), 0.2 ul Taq polymerase, and 1.0 ul template DNA), and slightly modified
cycling conditions (initial denaturation of 1.5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for
30 s, and 72’C for 1 min; final extension of 2 min at 72°C, and then left at 14’C) to get my PCR
product (Braby and Somero, 2006a). Then, 0.2 ul Hhal enzyme, 1.5 ul 1Ox buffer, and 0.15 ul
bovine serum albumin (100 ug ml") were added to 15 ul PCR amplicon, and digested for 4
hours at 37°
PCR products for both loci were visualized using gel electrophoresis on a 2% agarose
gel, stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain. For the Glu-5 locus, I added 5 ul PCR amplicon
into each well, and for the ITS locus after digestion, I added 15 ul digest solution with 3 ul
Blue/Orange 6x loading dye to each ladder. Glu-5 was run at 150V for 45 min, while the I7S
digest was run at 120V for 50 min. To arrive at the final genotype designation, individuals were
scored at each locus separately, and then compared: if either locus indicated a hybrid, then that
individual was classified as a hybrid.
I selected individuals within a 30-50 mm shell length range, to attempt to minimize size
as a variable in enzyme activity. Äfter doing this, my sample size was reduced to 9 M.
galloprovincialis, 13 hybrids, and 12 M. trossulus individuals.
MDH enzyme assay
The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme assay cocktail contained 50 ml of 0.20 M
imidazole/Cl buffer, 0.0054 g of NADH (final concentration of O.15 mM) and 0.0014 g
oxaloacetate (final concentration of 0.2 mM). The assay cocktail was prepared fresh each day
and stored on ice in a conical plastic tube covered by foil.
To conduct the MDH assay, cuvettes were filled with 2.00 ml of assay cocktail and
placed in a 20'C water bath for at least 5 min. Next, the spectrophotometer was calibrated using
a cuvette with 2.00 ml of assay buffer, 0.20 M imidazole/Cl buffer. The spectrophotometer was
set for 60 sec running time, and a 340 nm wavelength. Then, I put a cuvette (with assay cocktail)
in the spectrophotometer's cell holder, and let it reach thermal equilibrium for 2 min. Then,
using a glass micro-pipette, 25 ul of homogenate was added into the cuvette and briskly stirred to
distribute the enzyme evenly. The lid was closed, the recorder was activated, and the enzyme
output was visualized on the screen.
Using the computer software, a slope of the line was calculated, to show the change in
absorbance per min. The slope was calculated from where the line initially became linear. Two
replicates were run unless the difference between them exceeded 5%, in which case a third
replicate was run. Replicates were averaged to obtain a single activity value for the specimen.
CS enzyme assay
The CS cocktail contained 25.5 ml of assay buffer (50 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 8.2 at
20°C), 3.0 ml of 15 mM MgCl, 8 mg of DTNB (dissolved in 10 ml of assay buffer before being
added to the cocktail) and 3 mg of acetyl CoA. The tube containing the cocktail was wrapped in
foil and stored on ice.
53 mg of the substrate oxaloacetate were dissolved in 10 ml of assay buffer and stored on
ice in a foil-wrapped tube.
To conduct the CS assay, cuvettes were prepared with 2.00 ml of assay cocktail and
placed in a 20'C water bath for at least 5 min. The spectrophotometer was calibrated using a
cuvette with 2.00 ml of assay buffer, 50 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 8.2 at 20’C. The
spectrophotometer was set for a 400 second running time, and a 412 nm wavelength. Then, I put
a cuvette in the spectrophotometer’s cell holder, and let it reach thermal equilibrium for 2 min.
Then, using a glass micro-pipette, 25 ul of homogenate were added into the cuvette, and briskly
stirred to distribute the enzyme evenly. The background rate recorded in the absence of
oxaloacetate was visualized on the screen. Äfter 200 sec, 25 ul of oxaloacetate solution was
added into the cuvette, the solution briskly stirred and CS activity was recorded. The
background rate was subtracted from the oxaloacetate-dependent rate to get the final change in
absorbance per min that reflected CS activity.
Two replicates were run unless the difference between them exceeded 5%, in which case
a third replicate was run. Replicates were averaged to obtain a single activity value for the
specimen.
Data Analysis
Enzyme activity was calculated as change in absorbance per min, and then converted into
International Units/gram fresh weight (I.U./gfw) by using this equation: I. U./gfw -
(AAbsorbance/min x a conversion factor based on the molar extinction coefficient) - g tissue
added to cuvette. With these data, I averaged the trials for each individual and then performed
one-way ANOVA to determine statistical significance between the different species for each
enzyme.
To determine if any size-dependence in enzymatic activity existed in the specimens, 1
plotted shell length against enzymatic activity. I did this two times for each enzyme, once with
all species combined on one graph, and then again with individual species for each enzyme. I
used linear regression analysis to look for significant trends in both cases.
RESULTS:
For both enzymes, the overall trend in activities was: M. trossulus 3 hybrids 3 M.
galloprovincialis (Figs. 1 and 2). The average MDH activities for M. galloprovincialis, hybrids,
and M. trossulus were 72.943.8 I.U./gfw, 95.347.5 I.U./gfw, and 104.347.4 I.U./gfw,
respectively (Fig. 1). The ANOVA on MDH enzyme activity indicated significant differences
(P-value = 0.0165) among genotypes. However, not all differences between genotypes were
statistically significant. Using a Tukey post hoc test to determine which genotypes showed
statistical significance, it was shown that only M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus were
significantly different; the intermediate activities in hybrids did not differ from those of the
parental species.
The average CS activities for M. galloprovincialis, hybrids, and M. trossulus were
1.08+0.13 I.U./gfw, 2.18-0.24 I.U./gfw, and 2.6340.19 I.U./gfw, respectively (Fig. 2).
The ANOVA test on CS activity indicated significant differences (P-value «0.0001). However,
similarly to MDH, not all genotypes were significantly different from each other. From the
Tukey post hoc test, it was shown that M. galloprovincialis was significantly different from M.
trossulus, as well as the hybrids. However, the hybrids were not significantly different from M.
trossulus.
When comparing shell length to enzyme activities using linear regression, a significant
trend was shown for each enzyme when all the species were combined onto one graph.
Activities of MDH and CS versus body size had r’ values of 0.2347 and 0.3850, and P-values of
0.0037 and « 0.0001, respectively. Thus, when all specimens of all genotypes were analyzed
together, a significant negative correlation between size and enzymatic activity was found (Fig.
3).
12
However, when the relationship between shell length and enzymatic activity for each
enzyme was compared for individual species, different results occurred. The P-values for the
regressions of MDH activities versus body length for M. galloprovincialis, hybrids, and M.
trossulus were 0.10, 0.14, and 0.77, respectively, with r’ values of 0.3347, 0.1835, and 0.009,
respectively. Thus, none of the single-genotype regressions for MDH was significant (Fig. 4).
The P-values for CS of M. galloprovincialis, hybrids, and M. trossulus were 0.62, 0.08, and 0.01,
respectively, with r’ values of 0.0363, 0.2460, and 0.5024, respectively. Thus, in only one case,
CS for M. trossulus was a significant relationship between enzymatic activity and size observed
(Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION:
This study found significant differences among the Mytilus congeners and their hybrids in
enzymatic activities in the posterior adductor muscle. Most prominent was the difference
between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. The higher enzymatic activity in M. trossulus
relative to M. galloprovincialis is consistent with the former species being better adapted to low
temperatures. Thus, relative to M. galloprovincialis, M. trossulus would be better able to
maintain ATP production at low temperatures. This possibly would confer a competitive
advantage on M. trossulus at lower temperatures.
The fact that the hybrids exhibit an intermediate enzyme activity level is also notable.
The hybrids are not able to span the entire coastline as the parental species do, but are instead
confined to a narrow range of temperatures, where their parental species currently coexist.
Whether the hybrids function better than the parental species at intermediate temperatures
13
remains to be determined from these data. However, further genotypic analysis of populations
from diverse thermal environments might shed light on this issue.
Analyses of enzymatic activity versus body length in which all specimens of all three
genotypes are grouped in a single analysis for MDH or CS showed significant size-dependence
of activity. However, when each enzyme was analyzed separately for each species, only a single
regression was significant, CS for M. trossulus. This indicates that the differences I found
between genotypes were not influenced by size-related variation in enzymatic activity.
The most important conclusion drawn from my data is that the enzymatic activities 1
measured in field-acclimatized specimens support the conclusions of previous studies that
examined physiological differences between M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis. Namely, M.
trossulus appears to be better adapted to low temperatures than M. galloprovincialis because of
its higher intrinsic levels of enzymatic activity. All observed physiological differences between
the two species support the hypothesis that the native west coast species, M. trossulus, has
evolved adaptations to low temperature that are not found in the Mediterranean congener, M.
galloprovincialis. Differences in their thermal biology may thus be at least a partial explanation
for the pattern of invasion noted for M. galloprovincialis. The potential for further northward
spread of the invasive could be determined by climate change, as rising temperatures might favor
the invasive species. However, Braby and Somero (2006a, b) showed that M. galloprovincialis
is out-competed by the native species in habitats with low and variable salinity, so climate-
related factors such as precipitation could affect the further expansion of the invasion.
Furthermore, my study confirms results from previous research on enzyme biochemistry
in Mytilus (Lockwood, unpublished). The data obtained from Lockwood’s laboratory
acclimation studies also show higher enzyme activities for M. trossulus. This shows that in-field
enzyme activities show the same trend as those measured in laboratory-acclimated specimens.
For MDH, the differences in specific activity may be largely the result of intrinsic differences in
catalytic efficiency (Fields et al. 2006).
Lastly, there are many opportunities in this field for research on the hybrids. This study
didn’t look at generational hybrids, but instead only if a specimen was a hybrid or not. Hybrids
currently are limited to their narrow, intermediate temperature range, but there is a possibility
that with more back-crossed hybrids being formed, their temperature adaptation range may
change. Research looking more at the differences in hybrid adaptation could also reveal if they
will play a larger role in this competitive interaction in the future.
CONCLUSION:
Overall, this study yielded valuable information regarding the competitive interaction
between the native Mytilus trossulus, the invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis, and their hybrids.
This study indicates that M. trossulus is more cold adapted, M. galloprovincialis is warm
adapted, and that their hybrids may be adapted for intermediate temperatures. This correlates to
previous research looking at the physiological differences between these species, and also relates
to the current distribution maps of the species along the coast of California. Lastly, this study
confirms the findings made with laboratory-acclimated blue mussels by showing that laboratory-
acclimated and field-acclimatized specimens exhibit the same genotypic-specific differences.
This study provides insights into the role of temperature in governing the spread of the invasive
species, M. galloprovincialis, northwards along the Pacific Coast. The future of this invasion
may depend on rising temperatures, but more research on other factors like salinity that are
potentially able to affect the spread of the invasive will be needed to understand the dynamic
relationship between these two marine mussel species and their hybrids.
