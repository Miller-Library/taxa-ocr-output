-4-
mm mesh strainer leaving essentially all the Cirriformia to be
hand counted. The worms were never found below 25 cm (Hender-
son 1968, and Kee, 1968) thus, since each core was 28 cm deep,
the worms counted were considered to represent the total number
of animals below the cross-sectional area of the core, 80 cm.
To eliminate any possible differences in population density due
to tidal movement, all cores were taken at low tide when from
5 to 25 cm of water was standing over the substrate.
To obtain information concerning the mean population den-
sity of the sample area, cores were taken at regular intervals
over the sample area starting from tidal mean (O.0') to -2.0
at both low and high tides (fig 2). The curve obtained at low
tide was used as a standard with which to compare all additional
data. However, it should be noted that the curve obtained at
high tide is similar (fig 2).
To insure randomness in testing for aggregation, the natural
grid provided by the presence of the piers was used. The area
was divided into 108 squares and these were numbered. 24 numbers
were chosen from a table of random numbers and each core was taken
midway between the piers in the square correspondingly numbered.
Population densities were determined and the variance was found
by the following method:
