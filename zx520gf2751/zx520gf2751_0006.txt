-6-
10 ml of 85% Phosphoric acid and 1 ml of the indicator diphenyl
amine. FeSO, (approx IN) was titrated against each sample and
standardized with a solution containing no sand. The total
available organic carbon present was determined according th
the following formula:
V1 -V.
X .003 X 100 = % org C
V, - volume of FeSo
Va - volume of KCr,O,
.003 - conversion factor of ml to grams of C since 3 mg of C is
taken up by 1 ml of IN KCr,O,
The final value was multiplied by 1.3 to account for the 75%
efficienoy of the technique (Morgans, 1956). A factor of 1.8
was used to transform the data from % organic carbon into % or-
ganic matter available (Morgans, 1956).
To test for threshold levels of aggregation and possible
mechanisms attracting the worms, two small boxes (18" X 18" X 6")
were constructed and placed in an open concrete tank at the Hop-
kins Marine Station. Various substrates were placed in these
experimental boxes and worms set in different patterns on top of
the substrate and then left for 5 days. After 5 days, a masonite
