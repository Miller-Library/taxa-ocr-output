MATERIALS AND METHODS
The main field study area was established under Fisherman's
Wharf Monterey, California; where populations of C. spirabran-
cha were found at the O.O tidal level and lower. The presence
of piers in the area facilitated establishing a grid pattern
which could be utilized for statistical work, this also made it
possible to record exactly where each sample was taken. Another
area, about 400 yards from the wharf, where worms were found
at the +1.0 tide level and lower, was also investigated exten-
sively.
Counting the worm's tentacles as a measure of population
density was found to be infeasible due to the crowding often en-
countered which made quantification difficult at best. Further-
more, it was discovered that only about half of the total popula-
tion in any given area displayed their tentacles above the sand
at any time. (Henderson, 1968). At the same time, it was found,
by otserving populations of Cirriformia established in special
outdoor tanks at the Hopkins Marine Station, that O, content and
light can affect the number of tentacles showing. (fig 1). For
these reasons, sampling was accomplished by taking cores of a
constant volumee (2.2 liters), and sifting the material in a 2.5
