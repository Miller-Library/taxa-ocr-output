INTRODUCTION
The Cirratulid polychaete Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore
1904) is a common inhabitant of the sulfide-rich sand and mud
flat areas of Monterey Bay, occuring both intertidally and sub-
tidally. Preliminary field observations indicated that popula-
tions of this worm show a patched distribution over much of the
intertidal zone. Although often assigned to the sub-class Sedent-
aria, individual worms exhibit an ability to move considerable
distances per unit time (Henderson, 1968); a distance which is
often greater than the dimensions of the aggregates themselves.
Little has been written concerning the population struct-
ure of annelids and, in particular, marine polychaetes. Pre-
vious work on C. spirabrancha by Maginitie (1935) in Elkhorn
Slough, described populations in general terms only. This is
also true fer the work of both Courtney,1958, and George,1964,
on the English Cirratulid, Cirriformia tentaculata.
The present investigation was initiated to answer two
basic questions: de populations of Cirriformia, in fact agg
regate, and if so what is the mechanism? The results of this
study indicate aggregation does occur in this species and suggests
a mechanism involving an attracting substance and the necessity
of obtaining threshold population densities before aggregation
