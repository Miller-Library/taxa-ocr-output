40.13 and variance to mean ratios of 21.1 and 23.2 respectively.
The means of all three sample series, then, were in close aggree-
ment with those obtained earlier (fig 1).
The results of series of samples taken across particular
aggregates show that the number of worms per unit area varies
little within an aggregation. Samples taken within aggregates
had a mean of 63 animals/80 cm with a standard deviation of
6.3. Few samples were found with densities between 45 and 60
worms per unit area, thus 60 worms/80 cm was established as the
lower limit of aggregation and 45 worms/80 cm as the highest
mean density. The aggregates vary from 1 to 15 feet in length,

generally with a "fringe" area surrounding the aggregation. This
fringe area fluctuatesbetween 4" and 2' in width often with another
aggregate immediately adjacent or, conversely, it may be next to
an area of very low density. Thus areas of aggregation may be
within 4" of areas with few or no worms.
No aggregation patterns as such were observed with the ex-
ception to a relationship between the surface troughs and crests
produced by wave action. Samples taken in a trough often would
be within the aggregation limits and samples taken in adjacent
crests would often centain appreximately 1/2 the number of animals
per unit area as the adjacent troughs. Since the worms live in
