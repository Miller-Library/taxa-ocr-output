enter an area unless Cirriformia had previously occupied the
sand and 2) the above relationship could be overcome by add-
ing bags ofthe Cirriformia extract. One factor that could have
attracted the Cirriformia te the sand from aggregated areas would
be the organic content; however, Figure 5 shows that the sand
from non-aggregated areas actually had sohigher level of or-
ganic content. Hense some attracting substance may be given off
by the adult organisms which stimulates aggregation.
Although the worms seem to attract each other, a threshold
density per unit urea may well have to be reached before agg
regation can occur. In two additional experiments, substrates
taken from areas populatid with Cirriformia were placed in the
courtyard boxes and worms were subsequently put on the surface
in twe different patterns: one representing a clumped distribu-
tion andthe other representing a regular distribution (fig. 7-a,c).
The worms were left for 5 days and then dug up (fig 7-b.d). In
neither case did aggregation occur; however, when the total pop-
ulation density was calculated for the worms in the two boxes.
it was found that they were far below the levels associated with
aggregation in the field (2.6 and 4.1 worms/80 cm). While in
one box (B) the worms were initially aggregated in the center
(62 worms/80 cm"), the worms nevertheless dispersed within the
