ABSTRACT
hey
Cirriformia spirabrancha, a marine polychaete, was proven
to exist in aggregated densities in two field study areas lo-
cated in Monterey Bay, California. The data was gathered by
taking cores of the substrate and counting the C. spirabrancha
in each sample; this method lso proved valuable in determining
the density and geographical description of various aggregates.
Many environmental factors were eliminated as effectors of
aggregation since they were not able to vary significantly in
the short distances involved between populations of very high
densities (70/80 cm) and populations of very low densities.
Other environmental variables that could vary with small changes
in distances, organic content and particle size, were proven
to have no correlation with variations of the worm's population
density.
