tion densities of the substrate tested had no correlation with
the variation in organic content.
It was suggested during the course of the work that agg-
regation might be due to chemical attraction in that even
when animals were put in sea tanks under conditions where all
obvious differences in the substrate and other environmental
variables were eliminated, the worms would aggregate. To test
this hypothesis, boxes were constructed in a courtyard pool at
the Hopkins Marine Station. Two types of substrate were put
in each box. Half of each box was filled with sand taken from
aggregated areas than completely cleared of organisms and the
other half was filled with sand collected from areas containing
no populations of Cirriformia. However, in one of the boxes.
bags containing Cirriformia extract were buried in the half
containing sand that had come from areas with no worms. 250
worms were placed on the surface of the sand in the middle of

each box. This was accomplished by placing,the center square
of a masonite grid which was removed after 10 minutes when the
animals had burrowed into the substrate. After 5 days the grid
was sunk into the box and the number of worms in each square
counted( fig 6). The results were: 1) few or no worms iould
