grid was sunk into the sand and the worms counted in each square.
RESULTS
Random sampling of the test area (24 samples) resulted in
a variance to mean ratio of 23.56 or s'/m - 23.56 (fig 3). Ac-
cording to the test, the variance to mean ratio may vary from a
value of 1.0 for a randomly distributed (Poisson) population
to values less than 1.0 for uniform populations and values greater
than 1 for populations tending towards clumping. The variance
to mean ratio recorded far exceeds the value denoting aggregation.
Aggregation was likewise suggested by other statistical methods:
1) "k" of the negative binomial (Anscombe, 1949)
k--1.4
where: k = 7-8 = poisson dist.
s - X
k = (7-8 denotes agg.
X = mean
se - variance
2) chie test
X S (-1) s 24/4
where: Poisson dist. = 1
regular dist. =0
N= number of samples
agg. dist.)1
Two additional samples, one run perpendicular to the shore
(-.3 to -1.5 tide level) and one parallel to the beach (-.8'
tide level) gave similar results; these had means of 32.09 and
357
