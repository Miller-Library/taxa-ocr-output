1. (first three pictures) Cirriformia show more tentacles
as the light intensity lessens. (second two pictures) an air
hoseeintroduced over the substrate resulted in far fewer worms
showing their tentacles after 2 days.
2. Pupulation survey of main field area (each point repre-
sents 6 cores taken at the same approx. tidal region.
3. Results of Random Slampling. A = lower limit of agg-
regation, B = Mean of area (fig 1), C = Mean of these samples.
4. Particle Size; A = aggregated area, B = aggregated
area, C = fringe area of A and B, D = area with no worms.
9. Percent (dry weight) total available organic matter.
A - sample taken from the top of the core B = sample taken
from the bottom of the same core. C = sample taken from a
mixed core. Beavy Dark areas = aggregated densities, Medium
- Fringe populations and Clear areas = no worms present in the
substrate. Middle group taken 4" from each other and last
group is the two sands used in fig 6.
6ig 6 Worms set in middle of the boxes (a and b) with b
containing 7 extract bags. Dark side = sand from areas with no
Cirriformia, Light side = sand taken from aggregated areas.
7. 125 worms set in A in a regular pattern and densly
in B.
