n= total number of samples taken
Two additional series of cores were taken; one every 2 1/2'
perpendicular to the shoreline (-.3' to -1.5' tide level), and
the other every 4' parallel to the shoreline (-.8' tide level).
All samples were obtained in the area of high mean density (fig 2).
Sand samples were taken with a smaller coring device (dia-
meter 4 cm) to a depth of 20 cm. The population densities of
each core were recorded and the sand cleared of all macro organ-
isms and dried for 24 hours at 105°0. The samples were then sifted
through a series of Tylor Screens and the particle size recorded
in terms of ødry weight.
Organic analysis was accomplished by the Walkley  Black
titration method (Morgans, 1956). 2 grams of dried sand were
ground in a mortar and sifted to remove particles and organisms
above .5 mm in diameter. 10 ml of IN KCr,O, and 20 ml of concen¬
trated sulfuric acid were added to each sample. This mixture was
for 1/2 hour and then 200 ml of distilled water was added along
