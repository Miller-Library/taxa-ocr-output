the mud,the troughs would bring the worms closer to the surface
for respiration and feeding purposes. Although this relation-
ship was found extensively throughout the test areas, a signifi-
cant number of aggregations appeared where the interface between
white and black sand was relatively deep. likewise, some troughs
contained few or no worms and, in some instances, an aggregation's
border crossed a trough. Hense the observed relationship may not
be as significant as originally thought.
Since areas of aggregated Cirriformia and non-populated
areas can be adjacent, many environmental variabbes such as tidal
height, temperature, light intensity, salinity, and O, content
must be eliminated as potential effectors of aggregation because
significant differences would not be expected to exist over such
small distances. However, two substrate properties were consid-
ered since variations within small areas could occur. These two
factors were particle size and organic content.
Particles size: Within a limited area, cores were taken in
aggregates, in fringe areas, and in areas with few or no animals.
Figure 4 shows that there was no correlation between the sub-
strate's particle size and tke pepulatien density of Cirriformia
in the test area.
Organic content: Figure 5 shows that variation in popula-
