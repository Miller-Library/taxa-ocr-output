SUMMARY
1. Cirriformia have been shown to aggregate under natural
conditions where aggregated densities range from 60 to 80 worms
/80 cm.
2. There seems to be no specific pattern of the aggregates
themselves, other than a weak correlation to the closeness of
the dark layer of sand to the surface.
3. The number of worms per unit area stays roughly
constant throughout an aggregate as does the 2:1 relationship
between the density of the aggregate and the "fringe" area
surronnding it.
4. Light, O,ccontent, tidal height, salinity, and temp-
erature were eliminated as factors effecting aggregation. Part-
icle size and Organic content were likewise shown not to in-
fluence aggregation.
5. Adult Cirriformia appeared to be attrated to extract
of the smme species.
6. A possible reason for aggregation of Cirriformia would
be to concentrate a defense secretion; this secretion could also
be an attracting substance in the species.
