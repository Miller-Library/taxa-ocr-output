off the main aggregate thus explaining the fringe area. How-
ever this theory does not explain why, in the courtyard, the
worms aggregated within 3 days (fig 1).
2) Cirriformia may, at some critical density actively
seek each other by means of chemical attraction. In this case
a threshold level or organisms would be needed to initiate
aggregation which would explain why populations tend to agg-
man
regate less in density areas. A problem arises when con-
sidering how, fringe areas would be formed when the other areas
were clumping.
3) The third possibility is one of combining the pre-
vious two theories. The worms may first preferentially settle
as larvae, over the aggregations and later, as adult worms, gxcrete
a chemical substance to keep the aggregae intact.
Since many of the biological systems of Cirriformia are not

completely knewa, possible reasons for aggregation usually have
to be overlooked. For instance, the worm may be aggregating for
feeding purposes, but since it is not known what Cirriformia
eat, inferences tying aggregation and feeding behavior would be
useless.
During sampling, it was noticed that aggregations were
often free of other organisms. Judd's (1968) work of predation
