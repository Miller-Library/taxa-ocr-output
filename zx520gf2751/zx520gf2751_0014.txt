on Cirriformia suggested that few animals would eat the worms.
The obvious small of Cirriformia was found to be produced by the
presence of a substance tentatively described as a primary amine.
Purified extract retained the ordor of Cirriformia and pieces
of Notemastus soaked in the solution were rejected by very hungry
fish. Controls were eaten readily. Therefore a possible res-
son for aggregation is to concentrate the worms for a secretion
used as a defense mechanism. It may be that, for purposes of
biological economy, the same substance that is protecting
Cirriformia from possible predators is also attracting Cirriformia
to each other.
