5 day period suggesting the absence of any chemical attractand
even in high density populations. However, it is quite likely
that any chemical attraction could have been hargely lost by
dilution as it was necessary to wash the worms beføre counting
them; hense no aggregation would be expected to occur during the
initial period of the experiment.
DISCUSSION
Aggregated areas consistently range between 60 to 80 worms/
80 cm with the mean of aggregation close to 70 worms/80 cm.
Furthermore, 80 animals/ 80 cm appears to approximatesthe high-
est density in the aggregates, which seems reasonable since this
density represents 1 worm per gquare om of surface area of substrate.
The mechanisms of formation of aggregates of Cirriformia ire
not known and present data is insufficient to solve the mystery,
However, 3 possible theories will be discussed according to how
well they could apply to the worm's behavior as determined by
field observations and the courtyard experiments.
1) Cirriformia may, like many annelids, have a preferent-
ial larvae settlement pattern and, in this way, build up seper-
ate aggregates. The center of the population could get so crowded
tähttthis portion of the population has no possible way of moving.
Some worms on the outside of the aggregation would be able to break
