At the next observed stage the capsule, and often most or all of
the hydrotheca and hydranth of the infected hydroid were absent (Fig.
9). The three pairs of walking legs of the now exposed pycnogonid
were present as stubs which no longer contained the branches of the
gut seen in the two preceding stages. Occasionally two pycnogonids
at this stage were found at the end of a single hydroid stalk (Fig. 10).
In the next developmental stage the pycnogonid's walking legs were
well developed (Fig. 11). These legs still lacked extensions of the
gut; they waved slowly in walking motions similar to those of a normal
adult pycnogonid. Pycnogonids at this stage were also found in double
infections, occasionally sharing a stalk with a pycnogonid at the preÂ¬
viously described stage.
The last pre-adult stage seen was found detached from the stalk,
and walking slowly over the stolons, stalks, and hydrothecae of the
E. everta colony (Fig. 12). The three pairs of walking legs still
lacked extensions of the gut, and the chelifores were now achelate.
Active feeding of the encysted pycnogonid on the hydroid was
not observed. However, a direct connection between the pycnogonid
and hydroid gut was demonstrated in live whole-mount preparations.
Pressure on the pycnogonid forced a flow of fluid from the gut directly
into the coelenteron of the hydroid stalk. Pressure on the stalk
caused fluid to flow back into the pycnogonid gut. In neither case
was there any leakage of fluid at the junction of host and parasite.
