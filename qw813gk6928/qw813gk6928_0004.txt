same manner. T. duospinum with three and four pairs of walking legs
and a clear exoskeleton (Figs. 3 & 4) was not observed feeding, nor
was an attachment thread seen in these stages.
The most advanced stage of T. duospinum found on E. everta had a
maximum leg span of only 4 mm, still possessed functional chelifores
and a clear exoskeleton, and had an incompletely developed fourth pair
of walking legs. This corresponds closely with the earliest stage of
T. duospinum found on Aglaophenia struthionides. Larger T. duospinum
with four fully developed pairs of walking legs and a leg span of up
to 10 mm were found on A. struthionides, Abientinaria and Sertularella
but were not found on E. everta. The smaller eight-legged individuals
were light straw in color, while the larger specimens were a darker
golden brown and were occasionally fouled by epiphytes.
LECYTHORHYNCUS HILGENDORFI
The earliest developmental stage of L. hilgendorfi seen occurred
within aberrant, enlarged hydranths of Eucopella everta. Both hydranth
and parasite were encased in an exoskeletal capsule attached within
the original hydrotheca but extending outward considerably beyond the
hydrothecal margin (Fig. 5). Each hydranth contained a small pycnogonid
(Stage IV, Dogiel, 1913) with a proboscis, chelicerae, a small pair of
appendages, and three pairs of short walking legs (Fig. 6). The gut
was clearly branched. Within the hydranth the pycnogonid proboscis
was inserted into the coelenteron of the hydroid stalk, the chelicerae,
directed forward, held the pycnogonid in place. Slightly larger
pycnogonids with longer legs (Stage V, Dogiel, 1913) were also found
in an identical orientation (Fig. 7 & 8).
