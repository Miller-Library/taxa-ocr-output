DISCUSSION
Some pycnogonid species are known to be associated with character¬
istic organisms (Hedgpeth, 1980; King, 1973). Such associations have
been reported for adults of 36 and larvae of 21 pycnogonid species
(King, 1973). Only 13 of the approximately 500 species of pycnogonids
have previously been observed feeding while on a host organism (King,
19/3). The host itself may be the food source, being parasitized
(Allman, 1862; Dogiel, 1913; King, 1973) or preyed on (King, 1973),
or the host may simply provide a surface from which food such as small
attached plants, animals, microorganisms, or detritus is obtained,
The present study shows that the early developmental stages of
Tanystylum duospinum and Lecythorhyncus hilgendorfi feed directly from
the gut contents of the hydroid Eucopella everta. Both species of
pycnogonid often occur on the same hydroid colony. The early develop¬
mental stages of T. duospinum are ectoparasitic, while those of L.
hilgendorfi are endoparasitic. While adults of neither species were
seen to feed, adults of T. duospinum were found in abundance on only
one substrate, Aglaophenia struthionides, a hydroid whose color is
matched by the color of the adult pycnogonid.
By adopting different strategies (ecto-, and endoparasitism)
while employing basically similar suctorial feeding methods, T. duospinum
and L. hilgendorfi effectively divide a given hydroid colony into two
non-overlapping resources for food and space, and thus avoid competi¬
tion.
