occasionally found. No males carrying protonymphon larvae were seen.
Protonymphon larvae with clear exoskeletons were found, firmly
attached by the grip of the two chelifores, on the stolons, stalks,
and hydrothecae of Eucopella everta. When larvae were gently pulled
from the substrate, breaking the grip of the chelifores, they retained
a connection with the hydroid via a thread formed by secretion of the
cement gland. The thread, which may be at least twice the length of
the larva, acts as a safety line, preventing the animal from being
swept from the substrate if the chelifores lose their grip. In still
water a larva was observed to slowly ascend the line, until it
regained the substrate. A larva dislodged in a current was swung
in an arc, and rapidly regained a foothold on the substrate.
Undisturbed protonymphon larvae found attached to E. everta as
noted above, were often observed to have the proboscis inserted
through the perisarc and body wall into the hydroid coelenteron. In
one such individual, observed over a ten minute period, feeding was
seen to be suctorial. Expansion of the pycnogonid's gut from
anterior to posterior caused fluid to be drawn from the hydroid's
coelenteron into the pycnogonid. After a variable length of time a
contraction of the pycnogonid gut, starting at the posterior and
moving anteriorly, forced much of the ingested material back into
the hydroid coelenteron. The process was repeated at irregular
intervals. More advanced larvae (stages V and VI of Dogiel, 1913)
possessing their first and second pairs of walking appendages and
an unpigmented exoskeleton (Figs 1 and 2) were found attached to the
host hydroid in the same sorts of places and appeared to feed in the
