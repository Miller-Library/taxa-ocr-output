ABSTRACT
The hydroids Aglaophenia struthionides (Murray, 1860), Eucopella
everta (Clark, 1896), and Abietinaria spp. in the low intertidal zone
at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, Monterey Bay, California, often bear
the adult pycnogonids Tanystylum duospinum (Hilton, 1939) and LecythoÂ¬
rhyncus hilgendorfi (Bohm, 1879). Larval stages of these pycnogonids
were found living and feeding on Eucopella everta. The larvae of
Tanystylum duospinum are ectoparasitic. Those of Lecythorhyncus
hilgendorfi are endoparasitic in the gastrovascular cavities of
hydranths. Larvae of both species feed on the gut contents of Eucopella
everta, often on the same hydroid colony.
INTRODUCTION
Hydroid colonies found in the low intertidal zone on rocky
California shores often bear pycnogonids. At Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove, adults of the sea spider Tanystylum duospinum are frequently
found on the hydroid Aglaophenia struthionides, and less often on
other hydroids, bryozoans and tunicates. Adults of the pycnogonid
Lecythorhyncus hilgendorfi, less abundant at Mussel points during this
study, were found on the hydroids Eucopella everta, Aglaophenia
struthionides, and Abietinaria spp.. Larval stages of both pycnogonid
species were found only on Eucopella everta, often on the same colonies.
The occurrence of two similar forms undergoing larval development
on the same substrate provided an opportunity to make comparisons
and to examine the possibility of resource partitioning.
