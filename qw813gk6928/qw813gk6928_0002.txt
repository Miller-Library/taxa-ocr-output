MATERIALS AND METHODS
All material was collected from low intertidal areas at Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, Monterey Bay, California, between 18 April and
30 May, 1980. Hydroid colonies were generally collected on red algae
(Prionitis, Gastroclonium, and Gigartina spp.), but occasionally
were taken from rocks. Both homogeneous hydroid clusters (colonies
consisting of a single species) and heterogeneous clusters (consisting
of two or more species growing closely together) were kept separate
both during collecting and later in the laboratory. Samples brought
back to the laboratory were observed while fresh. Some colonies were
kept for up to one week without feeding, in aquaria and finger bowls
with constantly running seawater at approximately 14Â°C, during which
time additional observations were made.
Identification of larval Tanystylum duospinum was made by arrang-
ing the stages found into a continuous developmental series, and then
working backwards from the adult. The earliest larval form observed
possessed three pairs of larval appendages and lacked any adult
walking legs.
RESULTS
TANYSTYLUM DUOSPINUM
Adult Tanstylum duospinum were found most abundantly on fronds
of Aglaophenia struthionides, but were collected from a variety of
substrates including the hydroids Abietinaria and Sertularella, the
tunicate Archidistoma, and an arborescent bryozoan. Females with
developed eggs in their legs and males carrying egg masses were
