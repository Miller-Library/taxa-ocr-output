ABSTRACT
The presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was recently discovered in the
tissues of some Antarctic notothenioid fishes. This discovery raises the questions of
whether the effects of TMAÖ on protein function vary with temperature and whether
TMAO plays the same role in notothenioids as it does in elasmobranchs. Two
temperature-sensitive kinetic properties - apparent Kn of pyruvate and kea- of muscle A4-
LDH in Gillichthys mirabilis, a warm-temperature fish with negligible amounts of TMAC
in its cells, and Parachaenichthys charcoti, an Antarctic fish, are not significantly affected
by the presence of 150 mM TMAO at most temperatures from 0° to 30°C. The presence
of TMAO did not appear to significantly affect the loss of activity in the LDH of any of
the five teleost species studied over a period of 24 days. The Vmax of the LDH reaction in
these species was slightly inhibited by 150 mM TMAO at both 0° and 20°C. TMAO may
function by increasing the rigidity of the enzyme at hinge regions which play a role in
establishing the rates of conformational change.
TMAO is known to counteract urea’s perturbing effects on protein function in
elasmobranchs at an approximately 2:1 sureal:[TMAO] ratio. However, the effects of
temperature on this counteraction had not been studied. Below 20°C TMAO is able to
fully counteract the denaturing effect of urea, while TMAO’s ability to counteract urea at
those same concentrations appears diminished at 30°C or above. This varying
counteracting effect, as observed on the Michaelis-Menten constant, appears to be
consistent among species, including the subtropical cow-nosed ray (Rhinoptera bonasus)
the temperate catshark (Parmaturus xaniurus) and the Antarctic skate (Bathyraja easoni).
suggesting a lack of species-specific adaptation to solute effects.
