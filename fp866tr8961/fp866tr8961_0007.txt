Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B UV/ViS Spectrophotometer. The pyruvate reductase reaction
was started by adding 25 ul of LDH at various dilutions depending on the reaction
temperature.
Apparent Kn, of pyruvate values were measured in the manner described above, except
that NADH concentration was maintained at 150 uM and pyruvate was varied among
eight concentrations. Kn of pyruvate values were measured for Az-LDH with no solute
present, or in the presence of 150 mM TMAO for teleost LDHI reactions and 200 mM
TMAO for elasmobranch LDH reactions. Elasmobranch enzymes were also measured in
the presence of 400 mM urea (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and in the presence of both 400 mM
urea and 200 mM TMAO. Teleost LDHs were incubated with 150 mM TMAO for the
appropriate reaction velocity measurements. In order to prevent rapid enzyme
degradation by urea, elasmobranch LDHs were not incubated with solutes present.
Cold Denaturation of teleost Aj-LDIIs
The cold denaturation experiments were designed to determine whether the rate of
loss of LDH activity at 0°C over time changes in the presence of TMAO. Enzyme activity
was measured at 20°C using reaction velocities measured spectrophotometrically at 340
nm with constant 150 uM NADH and 2 mM pyruvate concentrations. Three mixtures
were tested for denaturation over time: LDH with no solute (control); LDH with 150 mM
TMAO; and LDH with 600 mM TMAO.
Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma Chemical Company) at a concentration of I mg/ml was
added to the enzyme to reduce LDH absorbance onto the walls of the container and to
control for the effects of protein concentration on loss of enzyme activity. DTT at a
