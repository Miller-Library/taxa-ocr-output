concentrations in their blood, notothenioids may use TMAÖ as an osmolyte which could
function as a freezing point depressant.
2) Although urea is not present in significant amounts in notothenioids, TMAO may
serve as a stabilizer at low temperatures, reducing the natural rate of protein degradation.
If this were true, we would expect that the rate of loss of protein activity over extended
periods of time would be reduced in the presence of TMAO at physiological
concentrations.
3) TMAO may have adaptive value to notothenioids by altering the binding affinity
and/or efficiency of enzymes at low temperatures. If binding affinity were affected, we
would expect that in the absence of TMAO, K,, values (apparent Michaelis-Menten
constants) would be higher than the expected range for teleost fish, and that the presence
of TMAO would lower those values into the expected range. If per molecule efficiency of
enzymes were affected, we would expect that kea values (catalytic rate constants) would
rise in the presence of TMAO at low temperatures in order to counteract the reduced
protein flexibility caused by reduced thermal energy.
4) Finally, TMAO may serve no significant function at all in the context of protein
structure and function; outside of its role as an osmolyte, it may be a remnant of
evolutionary divergence, or a “Spandrel of San Marcos" (Gould and Lewontin, 1979). If
this were the case, we would expect TMAÖ to have no effect on kinetic measurements
such as Kn or keat, or on rates of loss of residual activity over time.
I have addressed these questions using muscle lactate dehydrogenase (Az-LDH) from
various notothenioid and elasmobranch species. LDH is a useful enzyme to study because
it is a fairly universal element in the metabolic pathways of complex organisms.
