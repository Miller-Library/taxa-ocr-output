buffer used by Baskakov and Bolen (0.2 M tris-Cl, versus 0.16 M imidazole-Cl in my
experiment) or inherent differences between mammalian and teleost orthologs of the
enzyme.
The effects of TMAO and urea on the apparent K» values of Aj-LDHs of the
elasmobranchs are consistent with TMAO’s role as a protein stabilizer and urea’s role as a
denaturant. TMAO increases LDH's binding affinity for pyruvate, while urea lowers this
affinity. In the catshark and the Antarctic skate, the 1:2 ratio of TMAO to urea appears to
give almost complete counteraction of these kinetic effects, as is consistent with past
knowledge of solute counteraction. This does not necessarily mean that these two species
have adapted to the presence of TMAO and urea; the ability of the two solutes to
counteract each other may depend on conditions other than LDH sequence variation, such
as other small molecules present in the organism, or the counteraction may be inherent to
aqueous protein systems (Lin and Timasheff, 1994). The lack of complete counteraction
at high temperatures in the warm water ray further supports the idea that the
elasmobranch LDH has not adapted to the presence of these two solutes, since we would
expect that TMAO and urea’s combined effect on LDH function would not differ
significantly over temperatures within the animal’s physiological range. This change from
almost complete counteraction at 20°C and below to only slight counteraction at 30°C and
above is consistent between the Florida ray and the catshark, even though 30° is well
above the physiological range of the shark. This similarity suggests that TMAO’s ability
to counteract urea’s effects on protein function diminishes as temperature increases, and
furthermore that this diminishing effect is not the result of species-specific adaptation.
