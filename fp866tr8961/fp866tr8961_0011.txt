accumulate greater than 200 mM TMAO, their enzymes might be affected the way
elasmobranch enzymes are in those conditions.
TMAO’s effect on the maximum velocity of LDH’s pyruvate reduction is only slightly
affected by temperature, with a reduced inhibition at 20°C. The reduction of maximum
velocity seen in the presence of 150 mM TMAÖ is consistent with TMAO's hypothesized
protein-stabilizing role, since decreased flexibility would reduce the per-molecule turnover
rate of the enzyme. According to the mechanism proposed by Arakawa and Timasheff
(1985), TMAO’s unfavorable interaction with water would result in the exclusion of the
solute from the enzyme's contact area with the water around it, making a small surface
area more favorable for the protein and thereby causing stabilization. If this mechanism is
true, the change in the water’s surface free energy caused by the presence of TMAO does
not appear to vary significantly with higher thermal energy. A slightly lessened inhibition
of Vmax at 20° relative to 0° complements the data showing a decreased counteraction
effect of TMAÖ at higher temperatures; at higher thermal energies, TMAO's effect on
enzyme function may be decreased.
The cold denaturation portion of the study revealed long-term (at least 24 days)
resistance to denaturation of LDH of all five teleost species. The data (not shown)
illustrate the lack of any significant difference in the rate of loss of activity in the presence
of different TMAO concentrations. The percent of initial activity data generated by
Baskakov and Bolen (1998) for rabbit Az-LDH showed a large drop (approximately 25%)
in relative activity in the presence of 600 mM TMAO relative to no TMAO by about one
week. By comparison, none of the five teleost species I studied showed less than 90%
relative activity after more than three weeks. This discrepancy may be due to the different
