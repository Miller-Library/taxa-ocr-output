INTRODUCTION
Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a small organic solute, was recently discovered in
the tissues of some members of the notothenioid suborder of teleost fish (Raymond and
DeVries, 1997). Notothenioids are primarily Antarctic species, with some members living
in warmer waters such as those off the tip of South America. The function TMAO serves
in these organisms is a matter of some speculation, as the molecule may not function in the
same context in which it has previously been studied in different organisms. TMAO has
been known to function as an osmolyte, but it also affects protein function and stability.
Its presence in notothenioids may indicate a common function in different marine
organisms, or it may reveal divergent roles for a single molecule.
The ability of TMAO to counteract urea’s denaturing effects on proteins has been
well studied in elasmobranchs, which use both molecules for osmotic regulation. While
urea is known to denature proteins, TMAÖ is thought to have a counteracting, stabilizing
effect. Past studies have shown that TMAO can counteract urea’s effects on protein
function when both solutes occur at an approximately 1:2 concentration ratio of TMAO to
urea (Yancey and Somero, 1980). Further studies, involving rabbit lactate dehydrogenase,
showed that the increased rate of loss of protein activity over time caused by urea can be
partially counteracted by the presence of TMAÖ, although TMAO alone causes a slightly
increased rate of loss of activity (Baskakov and Bolen, 1998).
Based on TMAO's effect on elasmobranch and rabbit proteins, TMAO may be
hypothesized to serve any of several functions in notothenioids, including:
1) Although elasmobranchs are osmoconformers, notothenioids are hypo-osmotic, so
they face the problem of freezing in Antarctic waters. In order to balance the high salt
