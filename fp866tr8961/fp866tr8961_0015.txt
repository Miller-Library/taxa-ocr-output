Fig. 1: Temperature vs. K» of NADII for A--LDII of G. mirabilis. LDH was incubated
on ice and added in 25ul aliquots to reaction mixture containing 80 mM imidazole-Cl
buffer (pH 7.00020°C), 2 mM pyruvate and varying concentrations of NADH.
Reaction velocities were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in triplicate.
Error bars indicate one standard deviation as determined by Willman 4.0 software.
The presence of TMAO had no significant effect on apparent K,, values from 0° to
30°
Fig. 2: Temperature vs. Kn of pyruvate for A--LDII. Reaction mixtures contained 80
mM imidazole-Cl buffer (pH 7.0(020°C), 150 uM NADH, and varying concentrations
of pyruvate. Reaction velocities and error bars were determined as described above
Except for P. charcoti at 30°C, apparent Kn, values were not significantly affected by
150 mM TMAO.
Fig. 3: Relative Vmax for Ag-LDII (150 mM TMAO over no solute). Reaction mixtures
included 80 mM imidazole-Cl buffer (pH 7.00020°C), 150 uM NADH and 2 mM
pyruvate. Error bars represent one standard deviation based on five velocity
measurements made at each temperature for each species.

description of Fig. 2 for procedures.
Fig. 5: Temperature vs. K» of pyruvate for A--LDII of Bathyraja easoni. See
description of Fig. 2 for procedures.
