Furthermore, the enzyme’s sequence is extremely well conserved; orthologous
homologues tend to differ at only a few positions. (Holland et al., 1997) LDH is easy to
work with in the laboratory because of its stability across a wide range of conditions. The
extensive research already completed on LDH provides a foundation for the
characterization of temperature and solute effects. Specifically, the effects of TMAO and
urea on protein stability and function have been studied using elasmobranch LDH, making
this study relevant to past data (Yancey et al., 1982).
The kinetic effects of TMAÖ were studied in a range of teleosts and elasmobranchs in
order to compare the notothenioids, which use TMAÖ alone, with elasmobranchs which
use the TMAO-urea counteraction system. Both warm and cold-water organisms were
studied in order to elucidate possible temperature adaptations. Two Antarctic
stenothermal notothenioids were studied: Parachaenichthys charcoti and Notothenia
coriiceps. These fish live from -1.86°C to -1°C year-round. Two South American
notothenioids also were studied: Patagonothen tessellata and Eleginops maclovinus, both
of which live at approximately 2-10°C. P. tessellata is probably phylogenetically closer to
the Antarctic species than E. maclovinus is, potentially revealing different solute
adaptations (Balushkin, 1992). A fifth teleost, Gillichthys mirabilis, was studied in order
to compare the four relative stenotherms to a temperate eurytherm. G. mirabilis, which
lives at approximately 5-30°C, might be expected to show less adaptation to the presence
of TMAO, because its tissue likely contains negligible amounts of the solute.
Three elasmobranchs were studied: Parmaturus xaniurus, a cold temperate catshark
species from Monterey Canyon which lives at approximately 2-10°C; Bathyraja easoni, an
Antarctic stenothermal skate which lives at -1.86° to -1°C; and Rhinoptera bonasus, a
