concentration of 0.2 mM was added to the enzyme to prevent oxidation of cysteine side
chains. An 80 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.0 (20°C) was used, and the reaction mixtures
were incubated on ice until the time point at which they were assayed. Activities were
determined spectrophotometrically as described above at 20°C
For each time point, duplicates were measured for each of the three reaction mixtures.
Time points were measured at 0, 6, 24, 48, 96, 192, 408, and 576 hours.
Relative Maximum Velocities
The activity of the Aj-LDH of each of the five teleost species was measured in a buffer
containing 80mM imidazole-Cl (pH 7.0 ( 20°C), 150 pM NADH, and 2mM pyruvate.
Five replicates were run for each species with and without 200 mM TMAO. Velocities
were measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 20°C, and each reaction was started
by adding 25 ul of LDH at various dilutions depending on the species.
RESULTS
The apparent K» of NADH values for A4 LDH of G. mirabilis were not significantly
affected by 150 mM TMAO from 0°C to 30°C (Fig. 1). The apparent Kn of pyruvate
values were not significantly affected by 150 mM TMAO from 0°C to 30°C in G.
mirabilis, while the same values were not significantly affected in P. charcoti except at
30°C, where TMAÖ significantly decreased the apparent Kn of pyruvate value (Fig. 2).
The apparent K,, values rose with temperature for both species, with a steeper curve for
LDH of P. charcoti.
