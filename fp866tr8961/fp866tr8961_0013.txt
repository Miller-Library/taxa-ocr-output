The implications of the solute effects studied in this paper depend on the assumption
that the elasmobranchs studied share common solute concentrations. Measurements of
the urea and TMAO levels in the tissues of these species could reveal different TMAO
levels among species which live in very different environments. If this is the case, I expect
that elasmobranchs which live in warm, shallow waters would contain more TMAO than
those which live in cold, deep water. Increased TMAÖ levels may compensate for
TMAO’s possibly diminished counteraction of urea at high temperatures.
