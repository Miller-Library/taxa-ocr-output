Whereas the apparent K„ of pyruvate for LDH of P. charcoti increased by 12% at
10°C in the presence of 150 mM TMAO, the apparent K» dropped by 19% in the
presence of 200 mM TMAO (from 0.2776 + 0.0108 without TMAO to 0.2248 + 0.0054
with TMAO)
The relative maximum velocities of the five teleost LDHs in the presence of 150 mM
TMAO were approximately 88-94% of the velocities without solute present at 0°C, and
approximately 93-99% of the velocities without solute present at 20°C. (Fig. 3). A chi¬
squared test showed that the (Vmag, 150 mM TMAO)/(Vmax, no TMAO) ratio was higher at 20°C
than at 0°C (p=1.54x10**), but an analysis of variance showed that the ratios are not
significantly different when variances are considered.
During cold denaturation, the relative rates of loss of activity of the teleost LDHs were
not significantly affected by the presence of 150 mM or 600 mM TMAO over 576 hours
(data not shown).
In all three elasmobranch species, the apparent K», values rose significantly in the
presence of 400 mM urea at 5°C or above and dropped significantly in the presence of
200 mM TMAO at 20°C or below, relative to the values in the absence of any solute. (Fig
4-9) For orthologs of the catshark and the cow-nosed ray, the values in the presence of
the TMAO-urea combination did not significantly differ from the values with only urea
present at 30°C or above. At 20°C or below in all three species, the TMAO-urea values
did not differ significantly from the values in the absence of any solute.
