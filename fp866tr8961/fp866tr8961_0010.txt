DISCUSSION
The lack of a significant effect of TMAO at a concentration of 150 mM on the binding
affinities of either G. mirabilis or P. charcoti LDH across a wide range of temperatures
suggests that the solute does not affect teleost LDH by competitive binding. Since the
binding affinity is apparently unaffected but maximum velocities are slightly lowered by
TMAO, the solute may affect LDH by altering only the aspects of the enzyme which are
operational once the substrate is bound. The catalytic domain of LDH is comprised
primarily of alpha helical regions connected by regions known as hinges (Abad-Zapatero
et al., 1987); these hinges are where much of the inter-species sequence variation occurs
(Holland et al., 1997). Because the enzyme has a catalytic loop which closes around the
substrate and cofactor during the pyruvate reduction, the flexibility of the hinge regions
has been hypothesized to be a key determinant of the overall reaction speed. TMAO may
alter the rigidity of a specific hinge in the enzyme, slowing down the closing of the
catalytic loop prior to pyruvate reduction or the opening of the catalytic loop after the
conversion. The similarity of TMAO's effect on apparent Ky values and maximum
velocities between the Antarctic and South American stenotherms and the temperate
eurytherm suggests that no species-specific adaptation to the presence of TMAO has
taken place, despite the fact that TMAÃ– is present in much larger quantities in the
notothenioids than in the goby
The larger effect on apparent Kn, of P. charcoti LDH seen in the presence of 200 mM
TMAO compared to 150 mM TMAO may indicate that teleosts contain the solute in
levels low enough to avoid any significant effect of enzyme function. If these fish were to
