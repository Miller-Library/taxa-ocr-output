MATERIALS & METHODS
Purification of LDII
White muscle was added to a 50 mM potassium phosphate (pHI 6.8) buffer in an
approximately 1:1 volume ratio, and homogenized. The mixture was centrifuged at
11,951 g for 40 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through glass wool, and 0.5 M
potassium chloride, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 200 uM NADH were added.
A gravity column with oxamate agarose was rinsed with 100 ml 50 mM KzPO4 buffer
(pH 6.8) containing 0.5 M KCl, and then with 100 ml of the same buffer containing 200
uM NADH. 100 ml of the homogenate supernatant solution were passed through the
column, followed by 100 ml of the buffer with NADH.
The LDH was eluted with 100 ml KzPO4 buffer containing 0.5 M KCl and 10 mM
pyruvate. Fractions of elutant were collected and assayed for LDH activity
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The active fractions were combined and placed in a
dialysis bag. The dialysis bag was placed in 2 L of dialysis buffer (potassium phosphate,
pH 6.80020°C) for 4 hours, and another 2 L for approximately 14 hours.
Kn of NADII
Kn of NADH values were measured for Az-lactate dehydrogenase at 0, 10, 20, and
30°C with and without 150 mM trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAÖ Dihydrate, Sigma
Chemical Company) present. Each K„, was calculated using a buffer containing 80mM
imidazole-Cl (pH 7.0 ( 20°C), 2 mM pyruvate (Pyruvic acid, Sigma Chemical Company),
and eight different concentrations of NADH (Boehringer Mannheim). Reaction velocities
were measured by tracking NADH oxidation spectrophotometrically at 340 nm on a
