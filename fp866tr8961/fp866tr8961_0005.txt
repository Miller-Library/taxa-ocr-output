cow-nosed ray species from Tampa Bay, Florida which lives at approximately 20-32°C.
The catshark is known to use the TMAO-urea counteraction system, but the solute
systems in the rajai remain to be characterized.
1 expected cold-water teleosts and elasmobranchs to have higher apparent Ky, curves
than warmer acclimated species, since closely related species should have similar apparent
Kn values at their respective physiological temperatures. Stenotherms would be expected
to have steeper sloped apparent K,, curves than eurytherms due to their adaptations to
narrow temperature ranges. Apparent Kn curves were generated for LDH in the presence
of TMAO for the teleosts and in the presence of TMAÖ and urea for the elasmobranchs to
determine whether shifting or flattening of the curves occurs, possibly indicating
temperature-related adaptations of protein function in the presence of these solutes.
Apparent Kn of NADH and Kn of pyruvate curves were generated in order to examine
possible differences.
In order to examine solute effects on the catalytic rate constants of LDII, I examined
the relative maximal velocities of LDH in the absence and presence of TMAO. If TMAO
slows enzyme activity by preventing substrate binding in a competitive manner, then
relative maximal velocities should be unaffected. However, if TMAÖ works by changing
the conformation or overall rigidity of LDH, then TMAO should lower the maximal
velocity.
