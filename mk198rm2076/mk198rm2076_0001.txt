A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes
M. Holdren, D. Sandberg 1
INTRODUCTION
The lined shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes Randall,
inhabits the rocky intertidal region of the western coast
of North America. Generally it is found from the zone of
lower tides up to the high splash zone in areas where there
are pools, crevices, and boulders. P. crassipes may be
found higher and lower if vertical crevices are present and
it is able to migrate up and down with incoming and receding
tides. They are also found in tide pools of varying depths.
Crevices offer protection from wave action and from predators
as well as providing a damp surface to prevent the crab from
desiccating. Close associations with tide pools aid the
crab in this respect (Hiatt,1948).
Previous studies on P. crassipes include the major
work on its biology and molting cycle (Hiatt,1948), osmotic
regulation (Gross,1955,1957,1958; Prosser et al.,1955), and
reproduction (Boolootian,1965; Bovbjerg,1960a). Virtually
no previous work has been done with regard to rhythmic
activity patterns. Studies conducted by Hiatt indicated
P. crassipes was primarily active during the hours of darkÂ¬
ness. This observation was also reported by Bovbjerg (1960b)
and Knudsen (1964).
Endogenous rhythms have been discovered in other crabs.
An endogenous tidal rhythm has been discovered in a fiddler
crab by Palmer (1975). He found the rhythm could persist
in the laboratory for up to 5 weeks, but was most often
damped out rather quickly. The fiddler crab was most active
at low tide.
