A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes

insufficient to establish this with certainty.
Further evidence to support the hypothesis of a tidal
rhythm comes from the study in the outdoor tub in constant
dim light. On the second day of the study low low water
and high low water were about equal in magnitude and shifted
positions from day to night. The crabs showed peaks of
activity at both of these low tides, apparently following
the tidal shifts. This suggests that the crabs' activity
rhythm anticipated the semilunar shift of low tides. This
result certainly deserves further investigation.
A small peak of activity was observed in the field
shortly after sunset on the second day of the 48 hour study.
No data were available for the first day during this time.
Activity after sunset was also reported by Hiatt (1948).
Therefore, both tidal factors and the natural light-dark
cycle may affect activity. A circadian activity rhythm in
the crabs was not conclusively shown by these data, but the
possibility of one can not be ruled out.
Crabs kept in activity wheels on a LD 12:12 regime
displayed greater activity when the light was on. The
environment was artificial in that the crabs did not have
crevices for hiding places. The reason for activity in the
light is open to speculation. The running could be an
escape response.
When exposed to constant light, the crab's behavior was
erratic. Since no two crabs exhibited the same behavior,
no conclusions can be drawn.
