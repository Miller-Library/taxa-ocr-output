A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes
M.Holdren, D.Sandberg
In preliminary studies done during the month of April 1978
few crabs were seen at night, contradicting the observations
of Hiatt, Bovbjerg, and Knudsen. This contradiction and
the question of whether P. crassipes displays an activity
rhythm comprise the focus of this investigation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field Studies
Field studies on P. crassipes were carried out at
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California between 26 April and
3 May 1978. One area observed was between the +2 and 8 ft.
tide level and measured 7x8 meters. It was massive granite
containing large horizontal and vertical rock surfaces,
crevices, and part of a large pool, into which seawater
would flow with incoming tides. A lower intertidal observation
area was from the -1 to +3 ft. tide level, and measured
5x5 meters. Observations were made by sitting on top of
a tall boulder and remaining relatively still. The crabs
did not seem to notice the observer during the day unless the
observer moved close to the crab or shadows passed near the
crab. During the day observations were made from above
with a pair of Bushnell Sportview 7x35 binoculars. At
night observations were made using a Barsom infrared viewer.
The area was continuously monitored over a 48 hour
period during the study. At 8 hr. intervals weather conÂ¬
ditions, the temperature of rock surfaces and crevices were
recorded. Whenever a crab was sighted notes were made of
