A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes
M.Holdren, D.Sandberg
(1) the time (2) the height in the intertidal where the crab
was seen (3) the type of surface it was on, i.e. rock, crevice,
or pool (4) if the surface was wet or dry, and (5) if the
crab's activity was solitary or social. If the crab was
moving, the direction of movement, either toward or away from
the action of the waves, was recorded.
Brief observations of the area were made during the nights
of 2 May and 3 May 1978, when lower low water occurred shortly
after midnight. These observations were made with the infra¬
red viewer.
Activity Wheel Experiments
Six crabs with carapaces measuring 1.5-2.5 cm. across
were captured and each placed into activity wheels (Figure 1).
The activity wheels, made of plexiglass, revolve freely about
a stationary rod. Complete revolutions of each wheel were
recorded as deflections using an Esterline Angus strip chart
recorder. Each wheel containing a crab was placed in a part¬
ition of a light tight box. Running seawater was kept at a
level to just cover the lower edge of the revolving wheel(Fig. 2).
Food was provided in the form of Macrocystis pyrifera, attached
in a bundle to the side of the cage. This procedure was used
in experiments with three light regimes: LD 12:12, DD, and
LL.
The light source was a flourescent tube which provided
a light intensity of 2.4 pE/m/sec at a distance of 1 ft.
In experiments where activity was very high, (LD), data from
the recorder was scored on a scale of O to 5, with O indicating
no activity during a one hour period and 5 indicating
