A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes

between the hours of 1400 and 2400 (Fig. 6). The slope
of the regression line for these peaks is .94, representing
a phase advance of 56.6 minutes per day. The correlation
coefficient is.86.
LL - Activity Wheel
Statistical analysis of activity wheel recordings of
crabs in LL showed conflicting results. Again, data on
only three individuals was obtained due to equipment failure.
Though one crab showed more activity at rising tides than at
other times, another showed perfectly random activity with
regard to tides when subjected to a Chi-square test. The
third one turned the wheel almost incessantly and at what
appeared to be the same pace for many hours.
Simulated Natural Environment - LD
When the absolute numbers of crabs counted as active
each hour are graphed versus time, a repeating pattern
appears (Fig. 7). Very noticeable peaks of activity coin¬
cide with the hours around lower low water which occurs just
before noon on these days. Fewer crabs are active at other
times, particularly at night.
Simulated Natural Environment - Dim LL
Similarly, the graphed results of observations on crabs
in continuous dim light show peaks of activity at lower low
water during the day (Fig. 8). Note also the major burst
of activity that occurs on the second night at hours corre¬
sponding to low tide. This double peak occurs at the semi¬
lunar shift of lower low tides. There were not enough cycles
for analysis of phase shift.
