ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to thank our advisor, Chuck Baxter, for
encouragement at every stage of our study and for preparing
us well for our oral presentation. We are indebted to
Dr.Robin Burnett for assistance in many aspects of this
study, and Lawrence W. Harding, Jr. for careful reading of
this paper, many helpful suggestions, and coffee. We
appreciate our fellow students who were our ever-present
supportive companions as one 24.8 hour day led to the next.
