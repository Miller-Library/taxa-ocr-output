A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes

continuous activity throughout the hour. The activity of each
crab was scored for every hour of the study. The data were
normalized as hourly percentages of total activity which were
then summed and plotted as mean values for all experimental
animals.
In activity wheel experiments in DD and LL, activity
was plotted as summed hourly deflections for each individual.
These values were normalized as hourly percentages of total
activity to get a grouped plot for the DD study. Differences
between activity at rising and falling tides and differences
in activity at high and low tides were calculated using a
Chi-square test.
Simulated Natural Environment
In addition to field observations and recordings of
individuals in activity wheels, observations were also made
on groups of crabs in captivity. A large fiberglass tub (Fig. 3),
approximately 1 me, located out of doors was used for these
studies. Intertidal rocks were arranged in the tub to
simulate the natural environment. A few mm of sea water
flowed across the bottom and algae was present for food. A
Panasonic dim light TV camera was positioned four to five
ft above the center of the tub to view the entire surface.
Activity was recorded on video cassettes for five minutes
every hour, and viewed on a Panasonic closed circuit TV monitor.
Each observation was scored for the number of crabs that were
visible. A crab was defined as "active" if it could be seen
and positively identified as a crab, either by its shape or
by movement. In other words, it had to be out in the open.
