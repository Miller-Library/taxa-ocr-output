A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes
M.Holdren,D.Sandberg
Though field data are indispendible for an understanding
of Pachygrapsus crassipes behavioral patterns, these crabs
are so alert and cryptic that rigorous descriptions of their
movements in the field are difficult to obtain. The two
most successful methods in these studies were recording
from activity wheels and viewing small groups of crabs in
semi-natural aquaria.
These results suggest that P. crassipes has an endogenous
activity rhythm phased to the tides. Further studies are
necessary to determine the relationship between circatidal
and circadian variations in activity in the observed rhythm
in Pachygrapsus crassipes behavior.
SUMMARY
1. Studies in the field and in the laboratory removed from
tidal fluctations indicate a tidal rhythm of activity
in P. crassipes. The crabs are most active at lower low
water.
The phase advance in LD 12:12 was found to be .9 min
per lunar day. In DD the phase advance was found to
be 5.5 min per lunar day.
When the times of lower low water shifted from day to
night, crabs showed peaks of activity at both low tides.
This suggests that the crabs' activity rhythm follows
lower low water through the semi-lunar shifts of low tides.
A circadian rhythm was not found in this investigation.
However, activity after sunset and the effect of light
on the activity patterns of crabs in running wheels
