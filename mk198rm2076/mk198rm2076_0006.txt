be free of one type of external information about time of day.
The same materials and methods as before were used for
the second set of observations, except that the tub was
covered with two layers of 3 mil black plastic. This covering
was entirely opaque to visible sunlight. However, it was
found that a very faint glow of light did get through the
fiberglass sides of the tub during the day. Therefore, a
completely constant light condition was not achieved. The
red lamp illuminated the tub the entire time.
RESULTS
Field Studies
Activity during the 48 hr study peaked around lower low
water between the hours of 0800 and 0900. A second peak was
observed on the second day shortly after sunset, as noted
by Hiatt (1948). During periods of high activity (Fig. 4) the
majority of crabs were seen either feeding on or moving across
dry, exposed rocks. As the tide rose the animals moved away
from the action of the waves, into crevices. Although very
few social interactions were noticed, those observed usually
lasted only a few seconds. Crabs seen in crevices were usually
wedged in motionless. Often a bubbling sound could be heard
coming from the crabs in crevices. On several occasions
individual crabs were seen covering themselves with froth.
No reference to either behavior could be found.
Crabs were observed on lower rocks at lower low water
during the nights of 2 May and 3 May 1978. The number seen
