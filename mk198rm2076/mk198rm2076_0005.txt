A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes

or, if partly obscured, it had to move about in order to
be considered active. Nearly all crabs counted did move
around during the sample periods.
Natural Light Cycle
For the first set of observations using the set-up
described above, fifteen crabs, measuring about 3 cm across
the carapace, were collected and placed in the tub the day
before observations began. The population density in the
tub did not exceed densities that can be found in the field.
The light conditions under which the observations were
made were sunlight during the day and a 25 watt incandescent
bulb with a red plastic filter at night. The light intensity
was low; the minimum required by the sensitive dim light
camera to resolve the crabs and would not register on a
meter sensitive to 1 ft candle. But in order to control
for possible effects of the red light on the crabs, an infraÂ¬
red viewer was used for part of one night to count the
crabs. This device allows the user to see objects illuminated
with infrared radiation and requires no visible light. The
numbers of crabs seen this way did not differ noticeably
from those obtained with visible red light. This is in
agreement with Hiatt's claim that artificial illumination
does not disturb their foraging habits.
Dim Light
It was also of interest to see how a group of crabs
would respond to a situation where the light intensity
did not change from day to night. Such a situation would
