A tidal rhythm in P. crassipes

DISCUSSION
Early in our studies on activity patterns in Pachy-
grapsus crassipes field observations showed a peak of activity
at lower low water both during the day and at night. This
is in conflict with previous reports which indicate activity
during the hours of darkness (Hiatt, 1948; Bovbjerg, 1960b;
Knudsen, 1964). Since these studies indicated a tidal
rhythm of activity in field conditions we began studies in
the laboratory away from tidal influence and under a variety
of light regimes to investigate activity patterns and their
possible endogenous nature.
A 24 hour light-dark cycle is known to keep a tidal
locomotion rhythm at a strict tidal frequency, though under
constant conditions there is an average free running period of
24 hr 55 min (Enright, 1972), which is a phase advance of
the tidal period of 24 hr 51 min.
The presence of a tidal rhythm in P. crassipes is
supported by analysis in LD 12:12 where peaks occur with
rising tide during the hours of darkness. Analysis of
the means of the activity peaks shows a phase advance
of .9 min per lunar day. P. crassipes appears to maintain
a strict tidal rhythm in LD 12:12.
Analysis of activity peaks during rising tides in
DD during the subjective night shows a free running period
of 24 hr 56.5 min. This may indicate a circalunadian period
with a phase advance under constant dark conditions.
However, the sample size and period of the experiments is
