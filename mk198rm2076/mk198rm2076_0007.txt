at night during lower low water was comparable to the number
observed at lower low water during the day, although no
quantitative information was recorded.
LD 12:12 - Activity Wheel
A plot of mean percent activity versus time shows that
more activity occurs during the daylight hours (Fig. 5).
A Chi-square test comparing activity in light and dark shows
that there is significantly more activity in light than in
dark (.Olpg.025).
Peaks of activity occur during hours of darkness. The
means of these activity peaks, excluding activity in light,
were calculated by averaging the percent activity over three
or four hours to either side of the hour of greatest activity.
A least squares linear regression on the relationship between
the means and corresponding days, shows a slope of .87.
Multiplied by 60 minutes, this slope represents a daily
phase advance of 51.9 min. The correlation coefficient for
this linear regression is.92 (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969).
DD - Activity Wheel
Two of the 3 crabs recorded in DD show significantly more
activity during rising tides when analyzed individually.
There was no definitive pattern in the activity of the three
crabs with respect to low or high tides, i.e. one crab was
more active at high tide, another was more active at low tide,
and there was no significant difference between activity at
high and low tides for another crab.
When the data for the crabs were grouped, a substantial
peak of activity occurs at hours between low and high tide
