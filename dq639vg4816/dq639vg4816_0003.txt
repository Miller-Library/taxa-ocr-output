INTRODUCTION:
Memory is a dynamic process that undergoes constant reorganization and
restructuring. Memories are initially labile and sensitive to disruption and are then
consolidated and stored as long-term memories (Nader 2003). When such a memory is
recalled, or reactivated, it must be reconsolidated via a separate but similar process and
stored in the context of the new situation (Lee et al 2004). Reconsolidation strengthens
memories and must follow reactivation or the memory will be forgotten (Misanin et al
1968, Przybyslawski & Sara 1997
Recent studies have shown that B-adrenergic receptors are an important part of
Long-Term Potentiation, a major pathway implicated in learning and memory (Gelinas &
Nguyen 2005). Propranolol, a lipophilic non-selective ß-blocker, blocks the stimulation
of B-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.). These catecholamines also normally function in the fight-or-flight
response caused by a stressful physical or environmental stimulus.
In rats, treatment with propranolol following reactivation of an emotional or non¬
emotional memory caused memory impairment (Przybyslawski et al 1999). This post¬
reactivation treatment was a more effective memory dampener than propranolol treatment
immediately after initial training, suggesting that ß-receptors are more important in
reconsolidation than consolidation in rats. Similar studies have shown that giving humans
propranolol immediately after experiencing or recalling a traumatic experience has
memory dampening effects (Pitman et al 2002, Brunet et al 2008). Additionally,
propranolol is more successful at dampening or blocking emotionally charged memories
