not all swim to the top left corner of the tank but were instead spread out in the front half
of the tank.
The negative treatment did not produce a clear pattern following treatment with
propranolol. For the first two hours after propranolol administration, fewer fish were
entering the front half of the tank. Then after three hours, the fish returned to their pre-
exposure levels (Fig 1). It took the negatively reinforced fish significantly longer to
initially learn their behavior (p20.03, Fig 2) and the highest level of accuracy achieved
during the experiment was only 67%, which is 3% below the lowest levels achieved by
the fish with the positive experience.
Additionally, the fish in the negative treatment tank (as well as in the neutral/Tap
tank and the control/No Tap tank) were too disoriented at 18 hours to be tested again,
possibly indicating an overdose. Interestingly, these fish showed no signs of propranolol
overdose during the first 3 hours. After 68 hours, they were nearly fully recovered but
had seemingly forgotten how they are normally fed. Instead of rushing up to the surface
when food was dropped in (as they had previously done and as the positive treatment fish
did), they allowed the food to drop to the bottom before consuming it.
The effects of propranolol on anxiety
The amount of time it took the fish to return to their normal behavior following
tapping on their tanks was used as a proxy for anxiety levels. The control tank shows an
initial increase in anxiety following tapping and propranolol exposure (Fig 3A). After 3
hours, this anxiety decreases dramatically. The neutral fish initially had very low anxiety
levels and almost completely ignored the tapping. This lasted for the first two hours but at
three hours the anxiety level increased dramatically (Fig 3A).
