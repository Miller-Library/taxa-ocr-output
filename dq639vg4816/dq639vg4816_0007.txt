The positive fish showed only a slight increase in anxiety following exposure to
propranolol (Fig 3B). The negative fish had the highest anxiety levels before propranolol
exposure, which is to be expected based on their treatment. Following drug
administration, there was an immediate and lasting drop in anxiety (Fig 3B)
DISCUSSION:
Propranolol and memory
Post-reactivation administration of propranolol decreased the intensity and
accuracy of the memory of the learned behavior in the positive fish, thus showing that
propranolol can have an effect on the retention of non-emotional memories. It is difficult
to determine from these data if the effect is stronger or weaker than an emotional memory
such as that of the negative fish due to their low levels of learning.
As previously mentioned, propranolol has the ability to block both emotional and
non-emotional memories in rats (Przybyslawski et al 1999). Because propranolol also
seems to dampen non-emotional memories in zebra fish, it is likely that the coupling of
ÃŸ-adrenergic receptors and the reconsolidation of emotional memories has been
conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. Further experimentation is required to
examine the effect of propranolol on an emotional memory in zebra fish.
Propranolol and anxiety
The negative fish show changing anxiety levels most consistent with literature on
propranolol and its potential use as a medication for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Following administration of propranolol, the stress response was greatly reduced,
possibly indicating a disruption of reconsolidation. A similar disruption of
