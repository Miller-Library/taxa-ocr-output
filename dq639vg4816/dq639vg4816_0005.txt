learned behavior was defined as correctly targeting to the front of the tank three sessions
in a row.
Water chemistry and testing of memory and anxiety
Each tank was buffered with a 2mM solution of HEPES sodium salt (minimum
99.5%). On the morning of the 21â€œ day, the side of each tank received five seconds of
tapping to reactivate the memory. Observations were made regarding the amount of time
it took the fish to return to normal behavior, a proxy for anxiety as well as the percent of
fish that went to the trained location following tapping in the positive and negative tanks.
Then each of the four tanks got 0.05 g of (*)-Propranolol hydrochloride
(minimum 99%) added to the water for a concentration of approximately 27 uM. This
concentration was determined based on previous tests of Propranolol concentration and a
literature search. Then the fish were again tested on their behaviors after 1, 2, 3, and 18
hours using the process described above.
RESULTS:
The effects of propranolol on memory
In the positive treatment, propranolol decreased not only the ability of the fish to
go to their trained location but the accuracy with which they did it (Fig 1). Before the
administration of the drug, 100% of the fish swam to the top left corner of the tank
following tapping. This quickly dropped off following exposure to propranolol and
between 1 and 3 hours only 70-85% of the fish went to the front of the tank. Although the
graph shows that 100% of the fish swam to the correct location after 18 hours, they did so
with less spatial accuracy than they had before the administration of the drug. They did
