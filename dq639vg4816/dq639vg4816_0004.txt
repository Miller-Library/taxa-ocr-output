(Cahill et al 1994). These characteristics of propranolol make it potentially useful as a
treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Most previous studies have utilized either rodents or humans as model organisms.
In this study, zebra fish (Danio rerio) provide a unique opportunity to examine an
organism with far less complex neurological organization and a more accessible genome.
which could eventually lead to a greater understanding of how the coupling of memory
reconsolidation and ß-receptors functions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Conditioning
Four 2-gallon glass aquaria were set up with five small to medium sized zebra fish
(Danio rerio) in each. One tank was assigned to each of the four conditioning treatments:
Neutral/Tap, Negative/Tap-Net, Positive/Tap-Food or Control. The Tap treatment
consisted of one full minute of tapping on the front of the aquarium during each session.
In the Tap-Net tank, 3 seconds of tapping was immediately followed by a 20 second long
chase with a small net. In the Tap-Food tank, 3 seconds of tapping occurred right before
the fish received a portion of their daily diet. The control tank was not exposed to any
tapping and had no conditioning sessions.
Over the course of 20 days, the fish received up to 7 sessions a day, with at least
30 minutes between each. Due to a high initial mortality rate, new fish were added to
each tank on the 6“ day, bringing the total number of fish in each tank up to seven. Notes
were taken regarding the number of sessions it took for fish to learn their behavior. A
