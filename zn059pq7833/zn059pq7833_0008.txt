Sperm Respiration. Before treatment, the rate of decrease in oxygen levels appeared
identical. However, treatments containing DMSO created an electrode artifact upon addition that
caused oxygen levels to rise rapidly and equilibrate only after 5 minutes (Fig. 7). At that time it
was possible to qualitatively compare oxygen levels before and after addition of these treatments.
Ceramide caused an apparent halt in respiration as indicated by the lack of a further reduction in
O2 levels. Dihydroceramide similarly showed a decrease in the rate of oxygen consumption,
though not as dramatically as in ceramide-treated sperm. On the other hand, addition of DMSO or
seawater caused oxygen levels to decrease at rates comparable to those before treatment.
Numbers next to respiration plots indicate a qualitative comparison of slopes between the
different treatments but are not actual measurements of oxygen consumption rate.
Discussion
These results show that ceramide disrupts fertilization in S. purpuratus in a concentrationÂ¬
dependent manner. This inhibitory action appears to affect the sperm since the effect on eggs was
reversible whereas ceramide-treated sperm were unable to regain their fertilization ability despite
the 50-fold dilution of ceramide that accompanied the addition of these sperm to the egg
suspension. Since such low concentrations of ceramide (on the order of 200 nM after dilution)
were well below the threshold above which ceramide reduced, it seems that the sperm were
unable to recover from ceramide treatment. This implies that without ceramide present in the
suspension around washed eggs, fertilization is not inhibited because sperm are not suppressed.
While it is not possible to rule out the additional inhibition of the egg, it is clear that the effect of
ceramide on sperm is large enough to account for the reduced fertilization observed. The lack of a
pronounced impact on eggs would suggest that ceramide does not regulate PKC activity in these
