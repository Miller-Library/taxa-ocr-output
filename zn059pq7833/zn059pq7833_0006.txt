Sperm Respiration. Sperm respiratory rates under the four treatment conditions were
qualitatively compared using an oxygen-sensing electrode. Seawater was placed in the 2 ml
respiration chamber, stirred continuously, and the electrode allowed to equilibrate until the
quantity of oxygen measured in the seawater was constant. 1 ul of sperm concentrate was then
added to the chamber to create a 1:2,000 final dilution. Once a constant sperm respiratory rate
was observed, 40 ul of each drug was added to the chamber through a small aperture and the
change in oxygen values noted and compared to the initial respiration rate (as determined
qualitatively by slope comparisons since technical problems made calibrations of the respirometer
impossible). All four trials were repeated once.
Results
Fertilization. The initial experiments established a concentration-dependent inhibition of
fertilization by ceramide but not by its analog, dihydroceramide, or by DMSO and seawater (Fig
1). Significant reductions in fertilization efficiency were observed at 5, 10, and 20 uM ceramide
compared to all three other treatments. Rates of fertilization ranged from 94 to 99% in untreated
controls while dropping to 68% with 20 uM ceramide
Egg Wash Experiment. As seen in figure 2, only 58% of eggs in O uM ceramide were
fertilized, in contrast to 91 to 94% of control eggs. However, after washing the treated eggs in
filtered seawater, normal levels of fertilization were achieved. Fertilization in the four washed
treatments varied from 95 to 97%. These results suggest that ceramide inhibition of sea urchin
fertilization may be reversible.
Sperm Inhibition. Treating the sperm with ceramide also resulted in inhibition of
fertilization, although the degree of inhibition was dependent on the volume of sperm used to
