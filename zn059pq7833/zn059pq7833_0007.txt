fertilize the eggs (Fig. 3). At 1 and 5 ul of sperm dilution, fertilization was significantly reduced to
45 and 80%, respectively. At 10 and 20 ul of added sperm, however, no inhibition was evident,
probably because excess sperm at these levels allowed fertilization to occur despite a large
number of inhibited sperm. Controls all fertilized at close to 100%. These results indicate that
sperm may be the major recipient of ceramide inhibition because fertilization is suppressed at
levels similar to those seen in initial fertilization experiments
Sperm-Egg Binding. Sperm-egg binding was severely disrupted in ceramide-treated
sperm, as seen in Figure 4. An average of only 0.5 sperm were bound to each egg in the presence
of ceramide, whereas sperm treated with dihydroceramide, DMSO, or seawater averaged 2.5, 3.2,
and 2.8 sperm per egg.
Acrosome Reaction Assay. Ceramide, dihydroceramide, and DMSO all significantly
inhibited the acrosome reaction relative to seawater controls (Fig. 5). Only 11 to 13% of sperm
reacted under these three conditions, in contrast to the 22% that reacted in seawater. The three
lower levels of reactivity did not differ significantly from each other.
Motility Comparisons. The change observed in the ODs4o was lowest in dead,
formaldehyde-treated sperm (19%) and highest in seawater and dihydroceramide-treated sperm
(around 50%) (Fig. 6). Sperm treated with ceramide had a 22% change in absorbance,
approximating the difference observed in formaldehyde-treated sperm. Oddly, DMSO-treated
sperm fell in between the extremes at 39%. This latter data suggests that despite the general
indications of reduced motility in ceramide-treated sperm, these results must be viewed with
caution because the DMSO treatment differed from other treatments containing similar amounts
of DMSO (see below).
