treatment. Finally, 20 ul of a 1:1,000 sperm suspension was added to each Falcon dish and
fertilization was assessed under the light microscope as described above.
Egg Wash Experiment. Four 5 ml aliquots of a 0.3% egg suspension were placed in
separate 15 ml test tubes and each tube was incubated for 5 minutes in 20uM final concentration
of one of the above treatments. The tubes were then inverted three times and a 1 ml sample of
each was placed in a Falcon dish. The remaining egg suspensions were washed twice with filtered
seawater and then placed in separate Falcon dishes. All suspensions were fertilized with a
1:125,000 sperm dilution and fertilization was assayed as above after 5 minutes
Sperm Inhibition. Four 1 ml aliquots of a 1:1,000 sperm dilution were placed in
Eppendorf tubes and treated with 10 uM ceramide or dihydroceramide, and an equivalent DMSO
concentration or seawater. 1, 5, 10, and 20 ul from each sperm treatment was then added to
separate 1 ml 0.2% egg suspensions and fertilization was measured after 5 minutes by light
microscopy
Sperm-Egg Binding. Four 1 ml 1:1,000 sperm dilutions were placed in Eppendorf tubes
and each one incubated for 5 minutes with 20 uM of ceramide or dihydroceramide, or an
equivalent concentration of DMSO or seawater. 50 ul of each dilution were then placed in a
second set of Eppendorf tubes and 150 ul of a 1.2% egg suspension added to each. After 20
seconds, the eggs were fixed with 200 ul of 4% gluteraldehyde in 100 mM HEPES seawater at
pH 7.2. The suspensions were washed with filtered seawater after five minutes, and the number of
sperm bound to the maximum circumference of each egg was scored blindly at 40X under
darkfield conditions. T-statistics were calculated using SigmaPlot.
Acrosome Reaction (AR) Assay. To induce the acrosome reaction, egg jelly was prepared
by bringing a suspension of 25% eggs in 10 mM HEPES seawater (pH 8.2) down to pH 5 with
