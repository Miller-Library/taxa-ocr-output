O.1 M HCl and swirling it for 2 minutes. The eggs were then returned to pH 8-8.2, centrifuged,
and the supernatant containing the egg jelly collected. The egg jelly was kept on ice while four
100 ul aliquots of 10 mM HEPES seawater (pH 7.9) were incubated with 80 uM of ceramide or
dihydroceramide, or equivalent amounts of seawater or DMSO as described above. 100 ul of a
1:100 sperm dilution was added and mixed gently by pipetting up and down. Aster 5 minutes, 200
ul of egg jelly were added using this same technique. After another 5 minutes, 400 ul of 5%
gluteraldehyde was added to each tube and the contents fixed for 15 minutes. A sperm squash was
prepared as described elsewhere (8) and assayed for the acrosomal reaction via 1000X phase-
contrast microscopy. Slides were moistened by exhaling warm air onto them and then cleaned
with a Kimwipe before placing 10 ul of sperm suspension on one side The fraction of acrosome
reacted sperm was determined by noting the loss of the phase-dense acrosomal granule at the tip
of a sperm and the presence of a faint process projecting from its apex.
Motility Comparisons. Previous studies showed that actively swimming sperm travel
down a centrifugal gravity gradient while immotile sperm remain largely suspended (9). Four 1 ml
1:1,000 sperm dilutions were placed in separate Eppendorf tubes and treated with 20 uM
ceramide or dihydroceramide, or equivalent DMSO or seawater concentrations. A fisth sperm
dilution was incubated in 1% formaldehyde to kill the sperm completely. All five dilutions were
transferred to glass cuvettes and their absorbance was measured at 540 nm in a
spectrophotometer. The cuvettes were then centrifuged inside 50 ml plastic test tubes at 120xg
for five minutes before recording absorbance a second time. The change in absorbance was
plotted as a percent of the original OD readings. A greater change in absorbance was correlated
with more actively swimming sperm.
