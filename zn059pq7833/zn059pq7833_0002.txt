retinoblastoma gene product, downregulate the c-myc protooncogene, and antagonize PKC (5). A
ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK) has also been discovered, but remains poorly
characterized. Recently, ceramide, as well as an exogenously-applied bacterial sphingomyelinase,
were found to induce the maturation of Xenopus oocytes (6). This suggests that meiotic cell cycle
progression in these animals (normally induced by progesterone) may act via a ceramide signal
cascade.
The discovery of ceramide’s role in frog oocyte maturation and the lack of studies
examining sphingolipid signaling in other aspects of early development prompted this closer look
at the possible use of ceramide as a second messenger during fertilization of the purple sea urchin.
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Early development has been well characterized in these intertidal
and subtidal inhabitants, and the large quantities of gametes released by each animal make them an
ideal model for studying many aspects of fertilization. Furthermore many of the events that follow
sperm-egg binding are induced by a phosphoinositide signaling cascade that generates DAG and
IPz as previously described. DAG activates PKC, which phosphorylates a Na/H exchange protein
and thereby instigates an increase in intracellular pH required to stimulate the protein synthesis,
DNA replication, and morphological changes required after fertilization (7). Ceramide’s putative
antagonism of PKC activity raises the possibility that it may modulate post- fertilization events in
the eggs of these animals. Indeed, this study was able to show that ceramide inhibited sea urchin
fertilization by affecting sperm motility and sperm-egg binding. Further proof of such a role may
help to establish an understanding of the mode of ceramide action and its role in regulating
cellular processes as well as providing a novel model system for dissecting the ceramide pathway.
