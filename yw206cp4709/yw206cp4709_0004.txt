A 9 volt electric prod, discharged at the extreme posterior end of the
caudal fin of the sanddab, caused it to lift off from the substrate on which it
was lying. A tripod-mounted Sony Handycam video camcorder, filming at 30
frames per second and 1/250 sec per frame, recorded a liftoff sequence on
each of two different substrates. In each case, the depth of water above the
substrate was 0.17 m. No sand was available for the sanddab to bury itself
Recording continued until the camera captured the fish lifting off from both
substrates in a similar fashion.
The solid substrate was a Plexiglas sheet serving as the bottom of the
tank. The porous substrate was a sheet of 1 1/2 mesh galvanized
chickenwire resting 0.08 m off the bottom of the tank. The sanddab
appeared to be equally comfortable on each substrate, although the mesh did
tend to fray the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins of the fish slightly over time
Playback of the two video sequences on a large-screen television
provided large, clear images easily traceable onto acetate film. A digitizing
pad, recording at centimeter intervals the position of the curved back of the
fish, converted the shape of the fish into Cartesian coordinates. These
coordinates provided values for the radius of curvature at each point along
the back of the fish using the following formula from Thomas (1953).
(14(dy/dx)2)3/2)
rho - â€” - radius of curvature atx

By hanging each of six frozen dead sanddabs from each of three points
along the perimeter of their bodies, the intersections of the three vertical
lines showed where the approximate center of gravity of the fish was
