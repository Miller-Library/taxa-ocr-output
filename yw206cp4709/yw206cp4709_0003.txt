for its highly developed camouflage techniques: the namesake sand it
throws on its left side to blend with its substrate may retard its escape when
threatened.
In contrast, the sanddab may gain locomotory advantages from living
on the bottom. Ueland (1984) studied how the sanddab is able to maintain
its position in swiftly moving water, avoiding locomotion altogether, by
positioning itself in certain postures on the substrate. Interaction between
seawater moved by the swimming sanddab and the solid substrate, called
ground effect, may allow it to move more efficiently than without an
interaction between the water and the substrate. Blake (1979) showed that
the mandarin fish (Synchropus picturatus is able to hover more efficiently
near a solid substrate due to the ground effect than it could without the
substrate.
This experiment sought to describe and quantify the effect of the
substrate on the movement of the sanddab through comparing the liftoff of a
sanddab from a solid substrate, which would allow a ground effect to occur,
and a mesh substrate, whose porosity would prevent a ground effect from
aiding in liftoff.
Materials and Methods
All experiments took place using a single sanddab (19 em long, 101.5
g) in a 0.80 by 0.40 m tank of still sea water, changed daily. The fish was
caught in the waters of Monterey Bay in the vicinity of Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California. The fish ate squid several times a week
during the experimental period.
