direction, for a total of about 10 cm along the diagonal, before beginning to
glide about O. 167 s after beginning liftoff.
Taken as the first derivative of the displacement versus time graph,
the velocity versus time graph also shows little difference between the solid
and porous substrates (Figure 6). Similarly, the acceleration versus time
graph differs littie between substrates (Figure 7).
Discussion
It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the bottom habitat of the
sanddab might give it a kinematic advantage over more freely swimming
fishes. The ground effect provided by the solid ocean floor might allow the
undulatory motions of the sanddab during liftoff to move it more quickly
than similar motions could when at a distance from a solid substrate. To
gain an equal acceleration, fish living in the water column would have to
move more water at a higher velocity than flatfish due to the extra
dissipation of energy in open water that would not occur against a solid
substrate.
Since the sanddab appeared to be consistent in both the rate of wave
propagation along its body and the type of wave generated when lifting off
trom each substrate, it is appropriate to asum
attempting' to execute the same liftoff from each type of substrate. Thus
any difference in displacement, velocity, or acceleration noted is precumably
due to the difference in substrate. Surprisingly, all the data collected point
to the conclusion that the fish is equally effective in lifting off from both the
porous and solid substrates and thus gains littie through any ground effect it
may exp√©rience. The porosity of the substrate thus appears to have little
effect on the movement of the sanddab.
