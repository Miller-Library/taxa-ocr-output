The sanddab thus appears to be lifting itself off the substrate using a
force unaffected by the choice of substrate and great enough to overshadow
any ground effect that the fish may also be experiencing. There seem to
remain three possibilities, or combinations of possibilities, for the chief
method by which the sanddab lifts itself off the substrate. One possibility is
that a backwards, horizontal thrust by the sanddab's tail against the
surrounding water is mainly responsible for its movement. This force would
push the fish horizontally through the water. Depending on the angle of
attack-the angle that the bottom of the fish makes with the horizontal
substrate-the fish would gain differing amounts of vertical lift from its
horizontal thrust. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the
sanddab would thus not depend directly on the substrate. A ground effect
caused by the solid substrate, would still affect lift but the experimental data
indicate that such a contribution is negligible
Alternatively, the main thrust may be to the rear but not be hydraulic
at all. It may be that the dorsal and anal fin rays, whose tips lie along the
bottom like two bulsdozer treads, move peristaltically to the rear to force the
fish forward. The reduced right pectoral fin might also give some small
shove against the bottom. In this case, as in the above possibility, horizontal
movement would produce vertical lift because of the angle of attack the fish
presents to the water.
The third possibility is that the fish gains a vertical normal force from
the substrate, but the nature of the substrate does not matter. The bottom
may act as a solid springboard to allow the fish to gain a vertical
displacement that would not be possible without a substrate to push against.
Freely swimming fish that accelerate using an undulatory motion like that of
the sanddab during liftoff initially slip laterally from their original axis of
