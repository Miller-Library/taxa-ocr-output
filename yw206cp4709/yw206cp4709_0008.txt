orientation, then cross their original axis to a point displaced slightly
laterally and forward from their original position. (Figure 8) Since for a
sanddab the normal force of the bottom prevents the initial lateral slippage
it can end up with a greater net lateral displacement than freely swimming
fish. This might give it an advantage in striking prey or escaping from a
predator. Images from a camera filming at more than 30 frames per second
would help resolve the above three possibilities into a model for the sanddab
during liftoff.
A final, less obvious advantage the sanddab gains from its bottom
habitat is its ability to optimize itself as a 'transient swimmer. This type of
fish tends to remain stationary, conserving energy and swimming only
occasionally in short bursts of acceleration. Of advantage to this type of fish
is a large muscle to body mass ratio, a deep silhouette to maximize the
amount of water moved with a single stroke of the body, and a body flezible
enough to create large amplitude waves (Webb, 1984 and Daniel, 1988).
Because of its flattened posture and bottom habitat, the sanddab is able to
maximize all three variables. Fish enjoying a transiently swimming lifestyle
high in the turbulent water column, by contrast, cannot afford such a deep
silhouette lest it act as a sail to drive them through the water away from
their desired position.
Conclusion
Evolving to live flat on the bottom of the ocean has resulted in the
sanddab making a number of adaptations. Its camouflage disguises it from
predator and prey, while the shape it assumes allows it to stay in place
despite water moving swiftly over its body. While it seems to receive little,
if any advantage from a ground effect during liftoff from the substrate,
