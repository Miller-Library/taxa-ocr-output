Abstract
The flatifish Otharichthys sordidus (Pacific Sanddab) is a bottom
dweller dependent on camouflage and quick escape response to protect it
from danger. In an attempt to determine the nature of the substrates role
in the quick liftoff of the sanddab from the ocean bottom, an experimental
fish lifted off alternately from a porous and a solid substrate. The sanddab
displayed similar displacement, velocity, and acceleration vectors in both x¬
and y-directions when lifting off from either substrate. The similarity of
movement on both substrates indicates that a ground effect, or force caused
by hydraulic flows redirected by the nearby solid substrate, is of littie
conséquence to the sanddab as it lifts off from its substrate. I suggest three
possible mechanisms, each independent of substrate, that may contribute to
the liftoff of the sanddab.
