Introduction
The sanddab Stharichthys sordidus is a bottom dwelling flatfish
common in the waters of Monterey Bay. Like other flatfish, the distance
between its pectoral fins is quite short, while it is quite wide between its
dorsal and anal fins. Since it has evolved to living on its right side, it thus
has Ã  depressiform shape. Its right eye moves during development to the
left side of its body so both can be used in observing its surroundings. It is
known to eat squid and bottom-dwelling crustaceans (B. Hopkins, personal
communication)
The dorsal and anal fins of the Pacific sanddab reach nearly from its
nose to its caudal fin, their rays just long enough to touch the bottom around
the margin of the fish. Its left pectoral fin is large and used for steering and
propulsion, while its right is reduced. This fin seems to serve the fish chiefly
as as prop, supporting its anterior end off the substrate. It is well
camouflaged in its favored sandy bottom habitat, featuring a highly
developed system of chromatophores and iridophores on its upper surface
for improving its ability to blend with different substrates (A. Deck, personal
communication). In addition, sanddabs throw sand on their bodies to further
blend with their substrate.
The posture of the sanddab has a marked effect on its mode of
locomotion. In contrast to fishes that swim freely in the water column, a
sanddab commonsy rests for long periods of time on the bottom, moving only
as danger or food approaches. Its reduced right pectoral fin has lost its
powerful thrusting ability, and its dorsal and anal fins may retard lifting off
the substrate by creating a partial seal with the bottom. It also might pay
