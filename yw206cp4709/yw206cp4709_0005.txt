located. The three points of intersection were always within several
millimeters of each other. The average ratio of distance from the nose to the
center of gravity divided by total length of the fish served to locate the
center of gravity of the experimental fish without needing to measure it
directly. This center of gravity provided a convenient reference point for
measuring the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the sanddab as it
lifted off.
Results
The typical center of gravity for a sanddab is 388 of the way from its
nose to its tail (Figure 1). This point is the reference point for all further
calculations of displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
The sanddab moved its body in almost identical fashion when lifting
off from each substrate (Figure 2). The speed at which it undulated its body
was virtually identical between substrates (Figure 3). The shape of the
wave, characterized by the radius of curvature at any given point along the
wave, appears consistent between liftoffs from each substrate (Figure 4).
Thus, direct comparison of displacements, velocities, and accelerations
between liftoffs appears to be valid.
In each liftoff, the fich held its body off the substrate, balancing as a
tripod on the posterior part of the dorsal and anal fins and the right pectoral
fin. Once lateral movement had begun, the displacement in the X direction
(parallel to the substrate) was slightly greater at any given time for the
experiment on the solid substrate than for the experiment on the porous
substrate. In contrast, the displacement of the center of gravity in the Y
direction ( e perpendicular to the substrate) was indistinguishable
between substrates even after the fish began moving rapidly upward (Figure
5). In each case, the center of gravity of the fish moved about 7 em in each
