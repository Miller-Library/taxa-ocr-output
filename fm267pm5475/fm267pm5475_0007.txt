individual, performed similar movement and capture along this same route
with a total elapsed time of only 1.6 minutes.
In addition to being slow, mobile foraging by subdominant octopuses
was not limited to any particular region of the tank. Rather, these
individuals utilized any region possible, based on whether or not it was
occupied by a dominant octopus.
Among the three subdominants (02 and Ö3 from group 1, 02 and O5
from group 2), a strong dominance hierarchy was also observed. Both Ö3 and
05 strongly avoided 02 (which was nearly double their size), never winning
any encounters with that individual.
Social Interactions
Several standard interactions were observed between octopuses (Table
2). These interactions could be divided into agressive and submissive acts.
Aggressive acts consisted of (1) Motion-To: an octopus moved in the direction
of another without any clear signs of foraging behavior, (2) Touch: one
octopus extended one or several tentacles (usually 1 and 2) and briefly
touched another, and (3) Wrestle: octopuses wrestled, using all tentacles and
occasionally web-to-web fighting. An act of submission was noted when an
octopus withdrew over approximately 0.5m and assumed a submissive
posture.
Associated with these interactions were three standard body postures.
The resting posture of octopuses was used during occupation of a home den
as well as during pauses on foraging excursions (Fig. 2). The attack motion
was used in two instances: prey capture and defense of a den or region (Fig. 3).
The submissive posture, as noted above, was used to indicate loss of an
encounter (Fig. 4).
