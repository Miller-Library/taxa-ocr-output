interesting to note that the hierarchy was not size specific, as 02 was the
largest organism, outweighing the dominant octopuses by as much as 40 g
The octopuses were observed under two primary conditions. The first
was general foraging patterns under semi-isolated conditions (other octopuses
hidden or motionless). The second condition was activity and interactions
when other octopuses were in motion or in close proximity.
Foraging
Äfter a period of observations, a general pattern to octopus foraging
emerged. A foraging octopus moved at a moderate pace across the tank floor,
using its tentacles to inspect unoccupied dens and around obstructions (Table
2).
A summary of foraging patterns by the dominant octopuses is shown
in Fig. 7. Octopus 1 used the indicated foraging paths (solid line) for 78% of its
total exploratory forays. Individually, path 1 was used 48% of the time, path 2
was used 32% of the time, and path 3 was used 20% of the time. Octopus 4
used the indicated paths (dotted lines) for 68% of its foraging periods. Path 1
was used 48%, path 2 was used 20%, path 3 was used 18%, and path 4 was used
14% of the time for the total amount of time foraging. These paths always
(unless interrupted by an aggressive act by another octopus) led back to the
home den. Simultaneous utilization of the areas where foraging paths
overlap was never observed.
Foraging behavior by the non-dominant octopuses was markedly
different. These octopuses generally waited in or near dens for a crab to
approach them. If mobile foraging was performed, it was usually a
laboriously slow process. In one instance, Ö3 moved from its position on den
4 over a period of 3.5 minutes to capture a small Pugettia crab. It then moved
slowly to den 3, at which point it paused to consume its prey. 04, a dominant
