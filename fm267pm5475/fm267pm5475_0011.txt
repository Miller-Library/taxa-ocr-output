Acknowledgments
A very special thank you goes out to Jim Watanabe, for without his
wonderful assistance, from advising when the course was unclear to leading
octopus collecting dives, this project would never have left the ground.
Thanks to Joe Wible and the staff of the Hopkins Marine Station Library, for
without their amazing skill to find even the most obscure articles, the
research for this project could never have been completed. Without the help
of everyone in the shop, these octopuses would never have had such a nice
place to spend their time. I am indebted to Jim Van Houten, both for his
willingness to go on late night dive trips to collect crabs as well as his
tolerance of my odd hours. Thanks also to Chris Morace for helping collect
shore crabs; the zoo was great while it lasted. Finally, an extra scratch behind
the ears goes to the Station cat, Vanilla, for keeping me company at all odd
hours of the night as I conducted my observations.
