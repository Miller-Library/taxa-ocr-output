All interactions were recorded and win/loss records of octopuses 1 and
4 (the two most aggressive octopuses) were calculated with respect to each den
(Figs. 7 and 8). A general illustration of a typical series of interactions is
shown in Fig. 6 (see legend for action sequence). In this series, Ol won an
encounter with 02 at den 1 by Wrestling, and 02 won an encounter with Ö3
at den 4 by Motion-Toward.
In several isolated incidents, Ö1 and 04 were also observed to inspect
dens within their territorial perimeter (dens 1,2, and 3 for O1, dens 4, 5, 6, and
7 for 04) immediately following emergence from their dens after feeding.
This action was assumed to be aggressive in nature (rather than foraging
behavior). In one instance, Ö3 was resting in den 2 and was subsequently
evicted by O1, who then immediately returned to its home den, den 1.
Discussion
In this experimental situation, two of the subject octopuses underwent
activities that suggest territoriality. The use of local foraging patterns
indicates a selective area of resource use. The observed social interactions,
including den defense and evictions, suggest the formation of a home range.
The foraging patterns exhibited by Octopus rubescens in this study were
somewhat different from those noted in other species (Yarnall 1969). Rather
than exhibiting use of a common foraging space, foraging paths of the two
most aggressive octopuses were strongly regional. This suggests that the
octopuses were utilizing specific resources from a defined area of the tank.
Use of a region alone, however, does not necessarily constitute
territoriality. Supplemental information can be derived from the win/loss
record of an individual in a given region. Wilson (1975) hypothesized that
species territoriality might be characterized by a gradient of aggressiveness and
