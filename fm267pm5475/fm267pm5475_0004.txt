an open-seawater system, with the water temperature varying from 10-12
degrees C.
The tank was kept under a tarp-covered enclosure to limit sunlight
exposure and to mimic light conditions at 40 feet. As O. rubescens is known
to be nocturnal (Strickler 1987), all observations were made between 8 pm and
3 am local time.
A dim (60W) red light was used to illuminate the tank. The lamp was
placed at the end of the tank near the water inlet. For the first five days, the
light was turned on immediately preceding observation. As the octopuses
began to recognize this as a cue for feeding and observation, the light was
then left on continuosly. The light emitted was sufficient to allow
observation after dark-adapting for several minutes, but not so bright as to
inhibit octopus activity in any obvious way. Installationof a blind or screen
would have limited observational area, thus octopuses were observed from a
stool placed near the tank in various positions. The octopuses appeared to
habituate rapidly to this situation, and would only startle in response to
sharp, quick movements.
Eight dens were provided for the octopuses. These dens were
constructed of various materials. Two dens were built around small glass
bottles and covered with rocks. Four dens were created by stacking granite
rocks. On den was made from a quantity of abalone shells, and a final den
was created from a large barnacle shell (Fig. 1).
The octopuses were maintained on a diet of various shore crabs
(Petrolisthes eriomerus, Pachygrapsus crassipes, Hermigrapsus nudus, H.
oregonesis) and subtidal crabs (Putgettia gracilis, P. producta). The octopuses
were fed an average of one crab per octopus per day, but as octopus feeding
varied considerably from day to day, the number of crabs was varied such that
