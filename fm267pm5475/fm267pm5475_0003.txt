Experience, however, has instructed caution over generalizing
behavior beyond specific species (Wilson 1975). Although one species of
octopus does not exhibit territorial behavior, that does not rule out the
behavior for the genus as a whole. There are several differences that have
been noted in the ethology of Octopus rubescens (Stricker 1987) such that the
possibility exists that O. rubescens may defend a territory. Although her
findings were inconclusive, regional defense was shown in one individual in
the study.
Territoriality, as asserted by Mather (1980, 1991), could be identified by
two criteria. First, time spent occupying an area could indicate usage of a
given home range. Second, the win/loss record of octopuses at particular
dens might be utilized for an analysis of territory as well.
The difficulty of conducting field observations of wild octopus
populations indicates that study in a semi-natural environment would be
most effective in quantifying data. While such an environment presents
such problems as crowding and unnatural disturbance, it is to date one of the
most effective means of observation.
Materials and Methods
Members of the species Octopus rubescens were collected using SCUBA
from in the Monterey Bay, California. Subjects were gathered in 6-8L plastic
bags from a depth of 11-15 meters for transport to the Hopkins Marine
Station.
The octopuses were placed in a tank with dimensions 3.3 x 1.1 x 0.6 m
and a water depth of 0.5 m. The upper edge of the tank was surrounded with
a band of artificial grass to inhibit octopus escape. The tank was maintaned by
