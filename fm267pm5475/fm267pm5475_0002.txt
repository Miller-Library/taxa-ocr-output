Introduction
Access by octopuses to dens and shelters constitutes one of the most
important resources that determines the viability of an individual. Octopuses
must rely on body patterning and dens as their sole defensive mechanisms, as
they have no hard shell (Barnett 1962). It is likely, based on the important
nature of dens for octopuses, that they might defend such a valuable asset. In
turn, the defense of a territory around the den would allow the octopus a free
range within which it may forage for food.
Regardless of function, territoriality is a powerful driving instinct in
many species. Territoriality has been shown in the field voles Microtus
pennsylvanicus and M. ochrogaster (Myers and Krebs 1971) and the chickadee
Parus atricapillus (Desrochers 1989), among other species. It is an important
part of many species' ethologies (Manning 1967).
In her studies of O. joubini, Mather (1980) introcduced the two main
contrasting ideas of spatial use in octopuses. Regional occupancy could
consist of either a territorial system, where each member defends a specific
area, or a generalized social dominance system, in which space has less to do
with interactions than relative social rank.
Previous studies of various Octopus species have come to several
different conclusions regarding the use of space in octopuses. Early field
studies by Woods (1965) suggested that octopuses might be territorial. While
little field work has been done with octopuses since that date (generally due to
procedural difficulty), laboratory work performed by Ambrose (1982) and
Mather (1980) on O. bimaculatus and O. joubini have suggested that these
species are not territorial. Rather, these species appear to follow a strict social
dominance hierarchy and individuals appear to move in a common space.
