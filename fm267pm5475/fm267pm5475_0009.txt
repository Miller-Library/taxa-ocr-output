dominance measured from a territorial perimeter to the den. Such a gradient
has been observed in the two dominant octopuses of this study.
While territoriality was not clearly shown for the subdominant
octopuses in this study, there are two possible explanations for their behavior.
Crowding is the most plausible cause. When describing territory usage in
several species, Wilson (1975) has compared varying territory size to an elastic
disk. This disk expands or contracts proportional to population density.
When that density becomes too high, however, the territorial system begins
to disintegrate. It is possible that under the semi-crowded conditions of this
study that only the most dominant and aggressive octopuses were able to
maintain control of their territories.
An alternate explanation may apply to the case of the two juveniles. It
may be that octopuses do not determine or begin to defend a territory until
they are more fully developed. In the wild, they may spend their time as
juveniles looking for a suitable home den, isolated from the pressures of
other octopuses. They may also simply exist in the areas between territories
until they are adequately developed to challenge the aggressive dominant
octopuses. This type of variation in territorial structure has been related to
life history stages in several other organisms, such as the black-capped
chickadees (P. atricapillus) (Wilson 1975).
Several previous studies of octopus behavior in other species have
indicated that those species are not territorial, but instead exhibit a size-based
dominance hierarchy (Ambrose 1982, Mather 1980, Forsythe and Hanlon
1988). There are substantial differences between Octopus rubescens and the
other species studied, however, that may lead to a contrast in the use of space
by these various species.
