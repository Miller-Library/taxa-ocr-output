Abstract
Two groups of Octopus rubescens were maintained and observed for
space usage in a 3.6 m2 tank for one month. Composite regional foraging
patterns developed. A pattern of social interactions and body postures
reflecting territorial dominance was also observed. Two octopuses were seen
to be dominant within identifiable home ranges. These data suggest that
aggressive, dominant O. rubescens may defend a territory.
