Figure 1. Tank Diagram. The tank used measured 3.3 x 1.1 x 0.6 m and the
water level was maintained at 0.5 m. Dens and den numbers are shown, as is
the location of the dim red lamp used for illumination. A 3 cm layer of sand
covered the bottom of the tank.
Figure 2. Resting Position of Octopus rubescens. Observation of size and
coloration from this position allowed for a discrimination of individuals.
Note the raised head and exploratory tentacles.
Figure 3. Aggressive Motion of O. rubescens. This type of motion was used
in two situations: 1. Prey capture and 2. Attack in defense of a territory. Water
jets were used to propel the organism.
Figure 4. Submissive Posture of O. rubescens. This posture was assumed by
an octopus after it lost an aggressive encounter. Note the head pulled close to
the wall, as well as the tentacles curled around the mantle in a protective
position.
Figure 5. Octopus 1 Win / Loss Record. The total number of wins and losses
by this individual were calculated for each den. Wins were recorded over 02,
Ö3, 04, and Ö5. Losses were recorded to 02 and 04.
Figure 6. Octopus 4 Win / Loss Record. The total number of wins and losses
for this individual were calculated for each den. Wins were recorded over
O1,02, and Ö5. Losses were recorded to Ol and 02.
Figure 7. Typical Foraging Patterns of Ol and 04. These foraging paths
comprised 78% and 68% (respectively) of total foragin excursions by each
octopus. Foraging trails of Ol are represented by solid lines; those of 04 are
dotted. Individually, Ol used path 1 was 48% of the time, path 2 was used
32% of the time, and path 3 was used 20% of the time. 04 used path 1 48%,
path 2 was used 20%, path 3 was used 18%, and path 4 was used 14% of the
time for the total amount of time foraging.
Figure 8. Dominance and Territorial Defense. Represented here is a diagram
of a typical series of interactions. Event sequence: (1) 02 moved from its
position on the right hand side of the tank to rest on den 1. (2) Ol dropped
from its position directly above den 1 upon 02 and octopuses began wrestling
(3) O2 moved away from Ol to den 3 where it exhibited the ’submissive
posture, and Ol returned to its previous position. (4) After several moments,
02 moved from den 3 to den 4, at which point (5) Ö3 moved from its position
on den 4 to den 7. (6) 02 then continued on to rest at den 5.
