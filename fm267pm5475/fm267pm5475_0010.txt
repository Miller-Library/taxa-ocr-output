One such difference between octopus species lies in the length of time a
given shelter is utilized. The amount of time a given octopus inhabits one
specific den varies widely between species. The longest period Yarnall (1969)
observed Octopus cyanea inhabiting one specific den was 23 days. This
species was determined to be non-territorial. In contrast, Octopus
bimaculatus may occupy dens for a period of 5 months or more (Ambrose
1982). Territorial studies on this species have not been conducted. Ã–ther
work with various Octopus species, which concluded that the species were
not territorial, often did not allow sufficient time for subjects to establish a
home territory. Mather's study of Octopus joubini (1980) concluded that this
species was not territorial. The dens in this experiment, however, were not
fixed, and were moved around the tank by both octopuses and experimenter,
thereby keeping the octopuses from establishing stable territories.
The difference in long-term den use in Octopus species may be one key
to territoriality. Resource utilization by stable octopus communities may be
quite different from that of migratory or transient populations (Ambrose
1982). Individuals that remain in a given area would likely have a greater
interest in defending exclusive rights to that area. The total amount of time
Octopus rubescens may utilize a given den is currently unknown, but the
octopuses in question used one den as their home for the entire four weeks of
the study. Further studies on stable den habitation is necessary.
