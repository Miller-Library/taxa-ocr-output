food was always available. Feedings were generally between 11 pm and 12
am. Observations were conducted both before and after feeding.
The octopuses were collected in two groups. The first three collected
(O1, 02, and Ö3) were observed during a two week period. At this point Ö3
escaped, at which point two new octopuses (04 and Ö5) were added to the
tank, and this group was observed for an additional two weeks.
Several characteristics were used to identify the octopuses on each
night of observations. Difference in size was a sufficient indicator to
distinguish between all but Ö1 and 04. For these, a combination of resting
body coloration and locomotion method allowed these two to be distingished.
Thus, tagging was not necessary.
Octopuses were weighed and their dorsal mantle length (distance from
the center of the eyes to the tip of the mantle) was measured (Table 1). Sexing
was performed by observation of the 6th pair of suckers on the ventral
tentacles as well as examination for presence of a hectocotylus on the 4th arm.
Octopuses 3 and 5 were not large enough nor fully developed to allow an
accurate determination of sex.
Results
The subject octopuses acclimated quickly to the tank, and began feeding
within one day of capture. Äfter several nights of intense exploratory activity,
a hierarchy of aggressiveness and dominance began to emerge. In group 1, O1
was the dominant individual, defeating 02 in approximately 75% of
encounters, and defeating Ö3 in 100% of all encounters. At this point, Ol also
began using its standard foraging patterns (Fig 7). In group 2, O1 and 04 were
the co-dominant individuals. 02 was subdominant, as was Ö5. It is
