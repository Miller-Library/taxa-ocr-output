al. 1985). The second site was in Monterey harbor, just south of the Coast Guard
Breakwater. This area is very protected from waves and storms, and is in an area of high
human activity. However, the section of rocky intertidal used was relatively inaccesible
to foot traffic, and appeared to have little direct human disturbance.
Sites were chosen to provide a contrast of whelk abundances. Preliminary
observations indicated that whelks (mostly Nucella emarginata, but also limited number
of other species) were abundant at China Point, but were completely absent in the harbor.
In order to determine relative abundances of different species, I sampled transects
perpendicular to the shoreline that ran from the lowest barnacle I could find to the highest
barnacle. At China Point, it was not always possible to reach the lowest barnacle due to
strong waves action and treacherous rocks. I never found a barnacle growing below the
highest feather boa kelp (Egregia menziesii), and thus used this species as a proxy for
lowest barnacle in these highly exposed areas. I also ran a horizontal transect through an
area of high whelk abundance in order to expand sample sizes. On China Point, I divided
sampling equally between high barnacles (growing above the highest clumps of the alga
Endocladia), mid zone (growing in the Endocladia zone), and low zone (below the
highest barnacle of species Tetraclita). Within zones, I sampled randomly. In the harbor,
the distance between highest and lowest barnacles was less, and no clear community
zonation was evident, so 1 simply sampled randomly along the transect line, from the
lowest point where barnacles were found to the highest.
I sampled whelks in a .25 m’ quadrat. I chose one .01 m’ quadrat randomly from
within the .25 m’ quadrat to count barnacles. All barnacles of species Balanus glandula
and Chthamalus spp. were counted. No attempt was made to differentiate between C.
