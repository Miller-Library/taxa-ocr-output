Abstract:
Traditional ecological models developed in rocky intertidal systems state that
species ranges are determined primarily by physical stress in upper tidal zones and biotic
interactions in lower tidal zones. Studies of the barnacles Balanus and Chthamalus show
that smaller chthamaloids are able to persist in a larger range of habitats than balanoids
because of their greater tolerance to physical stress and lower susceptibility to predation.
Ttested this model on the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus spp. at two sites in
Monterey Bay which differed in wave exposure and abundance of the common predatory
snail, Nucella emarginata. I ran lab experiments to determine prey preferences of N.
emarginata, and measured densities of both species of barnacles and of the whelk along
transects in the field. B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. distributions were positively
correlated, indicating that competition between the two species did not play an important
role in determining distribution. Nested ANOVA's of barnacle densities revealed
significant differences between sites and among replicate transects within each site for
both species. Although whelks were abundant in the exposed site, they did not play a
major role in determining barnacle abundance. Lab experiments showed that Nucella
emarginata had a strong preference for B. glandula over Chthamalus spp. As this
difference did not manifest itself in differential distributions in the field, I conclude that
factors other than whelk predation alone regulate the distribution of these species. A
strong recruitment event in spring 2001 of B. glandula enabled me to compare
distributions of B. glandula adults and recruits. No strong difference was detected. The
very high variance in barnacle density in both sites may indicate that barnacle
distributions in Monterey Bay are regulated by multiple complex factors. Further
research is needed to understand these interactions.
