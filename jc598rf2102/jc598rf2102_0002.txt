Introduction:
The concept of distribution is fundamental to ecology. One of the first questions
we ask when we are attempting to understand a new species is, where can we find it?
Although exact ranges are difficult to determine, it is fundamental to our understanding
of Ã©cology that we can consistently expect to see certain species in certain habitats in
certain regions.
The factors that determine species' ranges are complex. However, certain systems
lend themselves to the study of ranges. The rocky intertidal is an excellent model system
for studying the factors that determine a species' range because biotic and abiotic
conditions vary greatly over a very small spatial scale. Species' vertical distributions are
determined over a narrow band of coastline where conditions vary from the permanently
submerged subtidal to the almost permanently emerged spray zone. Many classic
ecological studies have used the rocky intertidal as a model community for studies of the
determination of species' range.
The work of Connell (1961a, 1961b, 1970) on rocky shores in Scotland and Puget
Sound has been hugely influential in intertidal ecology and community ecology in
general (i.e. Menge & Branch, 2001). Successive long term studies of the dynamics of
barnacle populations established a model for the determination of species range.
Barnacles of the genus Balanus were observed to be competitively dominant over
barnacles of the genus Chthamalus. In Scotland, where both barnacles were present.
Chthamalus was overgrown by Balanus , which is a faster growing barnacle genus
(Sanford, 2001). Chthamalus populations persisted due to their increased tolerance to
physical stress - which enabled them to live higher on the shore than Balanus. (Connell
