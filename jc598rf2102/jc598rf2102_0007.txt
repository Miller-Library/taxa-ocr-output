(Fig. 3) N. emarginata was entirely absent at Breakwater Cove, so correlations could not
be calculated for that site.
The vertical ranges of B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. show little difference.
(Figs. 4, 5) Plots of densities vs. intertidal height indicate that both species are found at
the same maximum and minimum heights in both regions (although these maximum and
minumum values are highly variable between the two sites.) A strong positive
correlation was found between the densities of B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. (r -
630, P«.001, Fig. 6)
Barnacle distributions were highly patchy in all sites. Abundances per .01 m2
quadrat varied from 0 to over 250. Mean abundance within different transects at each site
were highly variable (Figs. 7, 8). Nested ANOVA showed significant differences in
mean abundances between sites and between transects within sites (Table 1). Overall
numbers were higher in Breakwater Cove than on China Pt., and there was significantly
higher variance in numbers of Chthamalus in Breakwater Cove than on China Pt. (F test.
P2.05). (Fig. 9) Recruitment of Balanus glandula was unusually high during the
spring of 2001 (J. Watanabe, pers comm). Recruitment occurred throughout the vertical
range of B. glandula (Figs. 10 & 1 1), but was highly patchy throughought, with recruits
uncommon in most quadrats, and highly abundant in a small number of quadrats (Fig.
12). Although there was a significant positive correlation between numbers of adults and
recruits (r==.207, P «.05), the tightness of this trend was low because of the high
patchiness.
