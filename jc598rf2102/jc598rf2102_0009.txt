Space competition between B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. did not appear to be
strong. The tightest correlation between pairs of species was that between B. glandula
and Chthamalus spp., indicating that where one species was abundant, the other was also
abundant. This is most likely not due to positive interactions between the two species.
but rather is due to the fact that where suitable habitat was present for one species, it was
also present for the other. Areas occupied by macroalgae, cleared by limpets, covered in
mussels, or in sandy gaps in the granite outcrops are all examples of types of habitat
frequently encountered in sites where barnacles were mostly or completely absent. Those
areas where barnacles were present were rarely completely covered. Free space was
nearly always present (although it was not specifically studied in this experiment.) Only
one out of the 155 quadrats I examined appeared to fit the description of Connell (1961b
of Balanus growing so densely as to cover all available space and outcompete
Chthamalus. Even in this one exceptional quadrat, numerous Chthamalus were found
growing among the Balanus. Thus, I conclude that interspecific competition between
these two species is not an important factor governing their distributions in southern
Monterey Bay.
The clear preference shown by Nucella emarginata for Balanus glandula is not
surprising. Paine (1981) proposed that the chthamaloid barnacles have taken an overall
evolutionary strategy of remaining too small to be eaten. I did not examine the size
preference of N. emarginata, but I did measure all barnacles in the field that were being
actively drilled by whelks. I was unable to find any that were less than 4 mm in basal
diameter. This size is larger than one standard deviation from the mean diameter of
Chthamalus spp., but is nearly one standard deviation smaller than the mean for B.
