diameters of a subsample of barnacles, and multiplied by the number of barnacles present
in that tank.
Data from field and lab experiments were analyzed in Microsoft Excel 98 and in
Systat 8.0. In most tests, all barnacles larger than Imm in diameter were grouped
together as adults. Except where explicitly examined (i.e. when looking at recruitment).
barnacles less than Imm in diameter were excluded from analysis, as they were assumed
to be recent recruits.
Results:
In the lab experiment the whelk Nucella emarginata had a strong preference for
Balanus glandula over Chthamalus spp. Percent cover was used as a measure of
availability, assuming that cover would be proportional to the frequency of encounter by
à randomly-foraging whelk. The availability of both species of barnacle was close to
equal in all tanks (Fig. 1). The mean diameter of Chthamalus spp. was 2.23 mm, while
the mean diameter of B. glandula was 5.20. There were six times as many individuals of
Chthamalus spp. as B. glandula, but many of the Chthamalus were very small. Forty
two percent of the individual B. glandula were consumed, compared to only 2.3% of the
Chthamalus spp. Pooling all 3 tanks, the whelk's diet was 75.5% B. glandula (Fig. 1).
Nucella ate significantly more B. glandula than expected, based on percent cover as a
measure of availability (Chi-square = 14.1, P«.001).
Analysis of field data revealed a positive correlation between densities of N.
emarginata and B. glandula (r = .377, P«.001) (Fig. 2). A stronger positive correlation
existed between densities of N. emarginata andChthamalus spp. (r= .511, P5,001)
