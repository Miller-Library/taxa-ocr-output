dalli and C. fissus, as they are ecologically similar and impossible to differentiate in the
field (Sagarin 1999). Barnacles greater than 4mm in diameter were classified as large.
while barnacles less than Imm in diameter were considered to be recent recruits. This
size classification was based on preliminary observations of whelk feeding preferences.
After sampling, the height of each .01 mâ€™ quadrat was measured relative to bolts placed at
known heights above Mean Lower Low Water in the intertidal,

covered rocks were taken from the harbor area. I found rocks in the harbor with a
mixture of Balanus and Chthamalus of a variety of sizes. I then mapped all of the rocks.
and placed them in flow-through tanks. Each tank contained two rocks, with the goal of
giving each tank approximately the same surface area of rock and cover of barnacles. In
all, the six rocks used had 1869 barnacles attached to them. Each tank contained five
whelks collected from China Point. Whelks were all similar in size, and sizes ranges
were similar in all tanks. The tanks were covered, and the whelks were left to feed for a
week on the barnacles. I checked the tanks twice a day to monitor the feeding progress
and to make sure that whelks were not escaping. When whelks were found on the outer
edges of the flow-through tanks, they were returned to the bottom, to encourage them to
climb around on the rocks. The experiment was terminated when approximately half of
the large Balanus glandula were eaten.
After the termination of the experiment, I tallied the number of barnacles on each
rock that were dead. I used a small dentist's tool to poke the opercular plates. If
opercular plates were missing or fell out when poked, the barnacle was counted as having
been eaten. In order to estimate surface area covered by barnacles, I measured basal
