1961b) Predation by whelks of the genus Nucella (formerly Thais) had a strong effect on
populations of Balanus in Puget Sound. Whereas most mortality of Balanus in Scotland
were due to overcrowding, most mortality of Balanus in Puget Sound was due to
predation. As a result of this predation, Balanus was limited to areas above the zone in
which Nucella was able to persist, thus much like the Scottish chthamaloids, Pacific
Northwest balanoids persisted largely in a refuge zone (Connell 1970.) The effects
observed on barnacles in these and other studies were largely responsible for the creation
of a central paradigm in intertidal community ecology, which has been widely applied:
upper limits of species' ranges are determined by physical stresses (i.e. heat, dessication).
while lower limits are determined by biotic factors (i.e. competition, predation).
Preliminary observations made in April 2001 at Hopkins Marine Station in
Monterey Bay caused me to question the applicability of Connellâ€™s observations about
Balanus, Chthamalus, and Nucella to the local ecosystem. I set out to test whether
predation by Nucella emarginata might be limiting the distribution of Balanus glandula,
and in turn, whether competition with Balanus glandula was limiting the distribution of
Chthamalus spp.
Methods & Materials:
Data were gathered at two sites in Monterey Bay, California. The first site was on
China Point, a part of the Hopkins Marine Life Reserve at Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University. China Point is the location of long term research on intertidal
ecology and ecophysiology, but is off limits to non-researchers, and is therefore relatively
undisturbed. The part of the point sampled is an area of protected outer coast (Ricketts et
