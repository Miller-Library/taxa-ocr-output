glandula. Thus, it seems probable that by staying small, Chthamalus avoids becoming
prey of Nucella. It is also possible that Chthamalus that grow to a size approaching 4
mm in basal diameter are rapidly eaten by whelks. If this were the case, I would expect
Chthamalus from Breakwater Cove, where whelks are absent, to be larger than
Chthamalus from Hopkins. I did not test this hypothesis, but the rocks on which a mean
basal diameter of 2.23 mm was measured came from Breakwater Cove. This appears to
lend support to Paine’s hypothesis.
The high degree of variability in population densities seen between the two sites.
and between transects within each site indicates that neither of these species are
competitevly dominant, but rather are part of a larger and more complex system. It is
likely that population densities are regulated by a variety of factors, rather than simple
competition and predation between the three species I studied. Recruitment patterns,
predation by other species, parasitsm (Lopez, 2001), physical stresses, and competition
with a variety of other space occupiers (macroalgae, limpets, and the mussel Mytilus
californianus) are all major space occupiers in Monterey Bay) probably play important
roles in determining space occupancy in the rocky intertidal. While I cannot completely
rule out predation effects by N. emarginata and competition between B. glandula and
Chthamalus spp. as determinators of distribution, it appears that neither plays an
overwhelming role compared to factors that have not yet been elucidated. The rocky
intertidal has proven a fertile ground for understanding the distribution of species.
Fürther investigation of the factors that determine the distribution of these species in
Monterey Bay may contribute to our understanding of distribution in many habitats.
