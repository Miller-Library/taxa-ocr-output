Discussion:
Results trom the laboratory experiment clearly show that Nucella emarginata
pr√©fers to prey on Balanus glandula rather Chthamalus spp. This confirms work by West
(1986) on China Pt., which showed that whelks in the field had a diet consisting primarily
of B. glandula. Based on this result, and the previous work by Connell (1961a, 1961b.
1970), 1 would expect that areas with high whelk abundance would correlate with areas
of decreased B. glandula abundance. With less competition, and a relatively small threat
from predation, I would expect Chthamalus spp. to increase in abundance. As discussed
below, this differs from what I found in the field.
All possible combinations of the three species showed significant positive
correlations. While this does not prove that there is no effect of competition or predation.
it does show that this effect is fairly weak. If predation interactions were strong, B.
glandula densities might be expected to correlate negatively with N. emarginata densities
(Connell, 1970), as whelks would eat all barnacles below a certain tidal height.
Furthermore, if predation by N. emarginata was the major factor determining abundance
of B. glandula, I would expect to see recruitment in areas of high whelk abundance where
B. glandula adults were absent. B. glandula recruits were not seen recruiting to any areas
where B. glandula adults were absent. On the other hand, as B. glandula is a sessile
species, and it is to be expected that its predators will be found in areas where it is
present. Although 1 did not see the very strong interactions reported by Connell in Puget
Sound (1970), it is probable that whelks play some role in regulating the abundance of B.
glandula.
