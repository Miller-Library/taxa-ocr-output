This paper would not exist without the patient support of Jim Watanabe. I cannot
thank him enough for his advice and the large amount of time he devoted to this project.
Many other professors and grad students were helpful along the way. Fiorenza Micheli,
Eric Sanford and Rafe Sagarin contributed both ideas and papers from their libraries.
Joanna Nelson and Luke Hunt aided in surveying tidal heights. The other students in the
spring class helped create a positive learning environment. Daniel Serres and Galen
Weston kept me entertained and excited through dawn tides, dark nights of labor on
computers, and bright nights of friendship and the cheapest, tastiest vegan food known to
Monterey Bay.
