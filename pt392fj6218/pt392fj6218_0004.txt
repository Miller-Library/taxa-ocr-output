scissors. The snails were then placed in normal seawater for recovery. In
all instances, the operated animals exhibited activity similar to that of
the normal ones. The wound appeared healed after two or three days, and op-
erated animals placed in the field resumed normal activity and would occasion-
ally be noted travelling three to five feet during a very moist night.
The following experiments and observations were carried out to compare
the responses of normal snails with those of snails in which the tentacles
had been removed.
General movement and righting
In the laboratory, the L. planaxis without cephalic tentacles did not
exhibit striking locomotive inabilities. Glass dishes were used for all of
the tests, and in practically every instance the extirpated animals travelled
across the smooth surface at approximately the same speeds as the normal ones.
When encountering obstacles, however, a definite difference in reaction was
noted. A normal snail, with its tentacles exploring the substrate immediate
in its path, would reach an object, touch it with the tentacles, and stop
before bumping into it with the shell. On the other hand, a tentacleless
snail would encounter the obstacle, bump into it with the shell, and continue
for a time as if trying to push the object over. If the impediment happen-
ed to be another snail, the animal without tentacles could climb onto the
shell, although observably slower than a normal animal.
To see if a lack of the tentacles produced an impairment to the ability
for righting, about 180 animals with tentacles and a like number without
tentacles were placed on their backs in glass bowls containing fresh sea-
water. They were then timed from entry into the water until righted at one
