lowing L. planaxis mucus trails, and that they follow trails regardless
of the sex of the author of the trail. This result suggested that perhaps
the tentacles are sensitive to any mucus or material that noticeably changes
the surface texture of the substrate. To follow this idea, the mucus from
several other inter-tidal molluscs was employed, using the same method as
described. The results for this set of investigations is shown in graph
IV, page 9. In most cases it seems that the mucus from species living in
close proximity to the L. planaxis populations exhibit properties close e-
nough to the Littorina mucus to elicit at least partial following. Art-
ifical trails made with methyl cellulose and granular mucin were tried, but
neither provided positive results.
Field observations
For observations concerning activities of both normal and tentacleless
animals while in regular field conditions, 100 males and 100 females were
taken from a large rock surface. All were anesthetized using MgCl2, the
tentacles were removed from one half of the males and one half of the fe-
males, the animals were marked, and all were placed back of the rock in a
large fenced area from which all other Littorina were removed. Regular daily
observations were recorded pertaining to pairing, clustering and single activ-
ity for 12 days. Graph I on page 11 shows pairing frequencies for all four
combinations of normal males and females and extirpated males and females.
From studies done on mating, the males are believed to locate the females for
copulation. Graph II, page 11, shows the comparative pairing, with any type
female, of normal and extirpated males. Both of these results indicate that
the animals without tentacles, especially males, are less able to locate
