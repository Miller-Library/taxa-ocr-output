definite clustering and increased activity can be noted (Rohe, 1964). To
determine if the cephalic tentacles were pertinent in detecting this water-
borne mulluscan aphrodisiac, tests similar to the Al spirata experiment were
set up, using the same general procedure as described. In one bowl, con-
taining normal seawater, were placed five normal males; in a second bowl,
also containing seawater, five males lacking tentacles were placed. At one
minute intervals, clustering tendencies were timed by recording the number
of snails in contact with other animals, either side by side or one on top
of another. Following this, 20 ml of seawater taken from a jar containing
approximately 200 ml of water in which 25 female snails had been kept for
four hors, was added to each bowl. Again the number of clustered animals
versus time was noted. Tests were run on 50 normal and 50 operated individ-
uals.
Results of all tests are summarized in graph number IV, page 7. All
snails, both experimentals and controls, showed some initial tendency to
pair and thus form clusters. However, this tendency is short lived except
in the normal males exposed to female extract. Perhaps the reason the re-
sponse is not sustained in extirpated males is that once the animal has climbed
onto the back of another snail, he lacks the probing equipment necessary to
determine the sex of his partner or to assume the correct position. The re-
sults again suggest that the tentacles do not play a role in chemo-reception,
though they appear necessary for definite sex recognition on contact.
Response to mucus trails
It has been observed (Miyamoto, 1964) that L. planaxis tend to follow
mucus trails across the rocks. A series of experiments was therefore set
