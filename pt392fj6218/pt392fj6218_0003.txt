The tentacles are used by the animal as a main guide to its movements
in the rocky areas which it so abundantly inhabits. Moving primarily during
the lower temperatures at night and in the film of moisture provided by high
tide and surf, the tentacles generally remain on the stony substrate and
slowly move from side to side. As the moisture decreases, or as obstacles
are encountered, the organs begin an up and down pattern of movement, with
the snail touching the substrate and immediately lifting the tentacle usually
no more than one to one and a half milimeters. When the snail reaches an
obstacle in its path, it undertakes a tactile survey of the impediment by
extending the organs to their full tapering length and moving them about.
When the animals are submerged, tentacular movement is usually restricted
to a continuous motion from side to side, in contact with the substrate. In
any circumstance, movements of the two tentacles may either by highly coord-
inated, as in horizontal swaying motions, or one tentacle may move completely
independently of the other.
In order to determine more precisely the functions of the cephalic tent-
acles, it proved desirable to extirpate the organs in a group of L. planaxis
and to compare their responses with those in a group of normal snails under
various conditions. It was necessary to anesthetize the animals prior to re-
moving the tentacles. An aqueous solution of magnesium chloride isotonic with
seawater proved to be superior to 1% propylene phenoxetol (Owen and Steedman,
1958), 1% chloral hydrate (Sivik, 1953), and 10 parts/million Sevin (Carriker
and Blake, 1959) for the purposes of this investigation. Having adequately
relaxed the snails, it was easy to pull the head a good distance from the shell
and to snip off the entire tentacle distal to the eye with a pair of iridectomy
