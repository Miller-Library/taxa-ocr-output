up to determine the role of the tentacles in such behavior. Because the
tentacles exploratively preceed the animal, it appears that these organs
would be apt for detection of trails.
By cutting off the foot of an L. planaxis, and dabbing the structure
on a glass plate, an artifical mucus path can be applied. Using plates
6 by 6 inches square bearing such mucus trails from female feet, two normal
L. plaaaxis and two males lacking tentacles were placed respectively in the
centers of the two plates. The plates were then taken into a dark room and
sprayed lightly and equally with seawater. After 15 minutes, the snails were
removed and the glass plates were immersed in a dilute suspension of India
ink in seawater to mark the paths of the animals during their movements in the
dark, a technique designed by Eckert (1964). Experiments were carried out
using each sex as a source of mucus and each sex as a test animal. Two spe-
cific examples of typical results are depicted below.
