seawater were added from a jar which had contained 30 A. spirata in 180
ml for two days. Evacuation from both bowls was again timed and an ac-
celerated departure from the water in both bowls was observed. To deter-
mine whether or not the animals were merely leaving the extract contain-
ing water because of having been replaced into water after an initial de-
parture, several tests were run with snails placed directly into the A.
spirata water. Differences in response in the two instances were neglig-
ible. Identical runs were performed for the entire test population, using
fresh seawater and A. spirata extract from the same jar each time.
Results of all trials are summarized on graph number II, page 7, and
show that the escape response in normal L. planaxis and in the animals
lacking tentacles was almost identical; if anything the response in the
latter group was faster. In trying to account for the quicker response
on the part of the extirpated animals, the same population was placed in
an aquarium for two weeks, after which they were run through identical tests.
Graph number III, page 7, demonstrates the results of the second test, and
shows that the tentacleless beasts were slightly slower this time. Perhaps
initially the extirpated animals were either in a more excited state after the
operation, or the wound was being irritated by the seawater and chemical.
In any case, it is evident that the cephalic tentacles are not critically
important as chemo-receptors in the detection of A. spirata at a distance
under water.
