minute intervals. The results, shown on graph number I, page 7, indicate
that of the animals which did complete the maneuver, the normal L. planaxis
were slightly quicker. Further corroborating evidence that the snails are
tactically dependent upon the organs for righting is that a fewer number of
tentacleless animals than normal ones even completed the maneuver after trying.
Response to waterborne extracts of Acanthina spirata
When the predacious inter-tidal snail A. spirata is introduced into
a dish containing normal L. planaxis, a definite evacuation from the area of
the larger snail will be detected within minutes. This response to the pred-
ator is induced through the effects of a waterborne chemical stimulus that
issues from the A. spirata, and is believed to be produced in association with
its mucus (Tittle, 1964). To determine if the point of reception for this
stimulus is the cephalic tentacle, or if its removal in any way affects the
response, animals with and without tentacles were tested in the following man-
ner.
From approximately the same area in the field, 100 1. planaxis were col-
lected and the total population was anesthetized in isotonic magnesium chlor-
ide. After an hour, the tentacles were removed from one half of the animals.
After the operations, all of the snails were placed in fresh seawater for re-
covery. Three to four hours later, the Littorina appeared totally recuperated,
and were then subjected to the tests. Two finger bowls were placed side by
side, each containing 100 ml of seawater. In one bowl, five normal animals
were placed, and five animals without tentacles in the other one. Both groups
were timed to determine the tendency to leave normal seawater. After 20 min-
utes, the snails were placed back into the center of the bowl, and 20 ml of
