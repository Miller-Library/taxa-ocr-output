In Fretter and Graham (1962, p.14), the following description is
given for part of the sensory apparatus in the snail Littorina littorea:
"Toward its posterior end the head carries a pair of laterally placed tent-
acles.... At the base of each is a cushion-like bulge.... This is the eye
stalk, and the dark spot on it is the eye. The tentacle, which is tactile
and olfactory, is thus the seat of three major senses." The snail Littorina
planaxis (Philippi, 1847), common along the California coast, has tentacles
very similar to those described for L. littorea. Studies have revealed that
the eye definitely is a light receptor and causes the animal to respond pre-
dictably to various light stimuli (Eckert, 1964). However, the portion of the
tentacle distal to the eye has not undergone extensive investigation, and
tactile and olfactory capabilities of this part of the organ are undetermined.
In April and May, 1964, studies were carried out at the Hopkins Marine Sta-
tion of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California, to determine the be-
havior and function of that part of the tentacle extending beyond the eye in
L. planaxis.
The two cephalic tentacles are situated at the sides and slightly back
of the large blunt snout. The organs are contractile, and when contracted
they fit snugly at the sides of the mouth. Upon extension, they appear as
delicate finger-like structures which exhibit movement patterns that vary de-
pending on the substrate or environmental condition the animal has encountered.
They are innervated from the cerebral ganglion.
