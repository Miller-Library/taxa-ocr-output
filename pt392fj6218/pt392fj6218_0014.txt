a time for complete regeneration, based on the average of a normal tentacle
(1.3 mm - contracted), is obtained and is about 4.5 months. This result is
far from conclusive because of both the gross extrapolation and the conditions
in which the animals lived, assuming that they did not provide optimum growth
opportunities.
The cephalic tentacles, of Littorina planagis, are not critical to
general movement, but are used, while the snail moves, for tactile
surveillance, and they enable the animal to perform more easily such
maneuvers as righting.
Removal of the tentacles does not impair the ability to detect dif-
2.
fusible substances from the predacious snail A. spirata or from female
L. planaxis.
3. The tentacles appear necessary for sex recognition on contact.
4. The tentacles are employed in following mucus trails on the substrate.
The trails of other L. planaxis are followed more consistently than
are trails laid down by other species of molluscs.
