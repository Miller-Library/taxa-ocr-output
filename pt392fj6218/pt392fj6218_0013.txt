female Littorina for pairing. This result follows the conclusions drawn from
the mucus trail experiments, in that the tentacles are pertinent for following
another mucus pathway and for sex recognition on contact.
Responses after extirpation of a single tentacle
By removing either of the tentacles and placing the animal on a clean
glass plate, the path assumed while in the dark was determined by again using
the carbon bath. Such experiments did not give clear cut results, but merely
hinted at tendencies. Twenty-four snails were tested, 12 with the left tent-
acle removed and 12 with the right taken off. The results were that 8 of the
animals lacking a tentacle on the left side exhibited circus movements to the
right, and 6 snails without a tentacle on the right side moved in circus mo-
tions to the left. Perhaps the nature of the substrate did not lend to more
consistent results, but circus movements are intimated, indicating a depen-
dency on tactile assurance.
Intermittently throughout the study, populations of animals were extir-
pated for various tests, and watched for tentacle regeneration. Using an oc-
ular micrometer on a dissecting microscope, accurate measurements could be taÂ¬
ken of the tiny regenerated tip that emerged approximately two to three weeks
after removal. In each instance, a regenerated tip would appear out of the
large stump where the original organ was located. The protuberance is flesh
colored, as opposed to the black remainder of the head. By relaxing the ani-
mals to be investigated, a standard contraction was obtained, so that lengths
could be compared on a time basis. These results are graphed on page 11. The
data is based on six stages of regeneration, although not equally spaced. y
making the disputable extrapolation to about twice the length of the graph,
