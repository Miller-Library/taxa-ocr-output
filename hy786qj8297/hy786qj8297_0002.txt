Extensive studies have been carried out on the physiology of the
swimbladder, the effects of pressure changes, and other functions such as
respiration, pressure sensitivity, and sound production. For a detailed
treatment of the swimbladder, see Gee (1983) in Eish Biomechanics and
Alexander (1966).
The center of buoyancy of a fish is the point at which the buoyant
force, primarily the upwards force of the swimbladder, acts. Alexander
(1965) postulated that the conter of buoyancy lay anterior to the center
of gravity. This conclusion was arrived at by noting the orientation of a
freshly killed fish in a beaker of water. He observed that the fish in
question lay ventral side up with its tail on the bottom and its head
slightly raised. In a later work, Alexander (1983) describes the technique
he used to determine the center of buoyancy of a living Nautilus. His
central assumption was that the center of buoyancy is directly above the
animal's center of mass in its natural orientation. Based on observations
of dead fish, this cannot be true for teleost fish with swimbladders.
This raises the question of how to deter mine the center of
buoyancy and the effects of this unstable force on the ability of a fish to
hover. The fish supplements the buoyant effect of a swimbladder with
forces created by its pectoral fins and caudal fin. These three forces and
the force due to the weight of the fish are the principal forces acting on a
fish as it hovers. An examination of their interactions and the net effect
on the torque and vertical translation of a hovering fish help in the
interpretation of actual behaviors.
