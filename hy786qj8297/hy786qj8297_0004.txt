intersection being the center of buoyancy. I assume that the center of
buoyancy lies at one-half of the lateral thickness of the fish. I then
measured the distance to the center of buoyancy from the anterior lip
and from the dorsal margin of the fish.
The density of one individual S atrovirens was calculated from the
weight in air divided by the volume without the swimbladder. The
rockfish was killed in a bucket of quinaldined sea water. Before weighing.
1 dried the fish, removing excess water from the gills and the mouth
cavity. The volume of a fish without swimbladder was determined by
displacement. The dimensions of the fish, the weight in air, the weight in
water with and without a swimbladder, and the area of the pectoral fins
were measured. The volume of the swimbladder was deter mined by
emptying the swimbladder using a syringe.
1 found the center of gravity by a method analogous to that used
for the center of buoyancy. The fish, partially frozen, was suspended
using a thin metal rod as a pivot. The fish rotated about the pivot until
the center of gravity lay directly beneath. A plumb line marked the line
along which the center of gravity lay. I used the same five holes as aboye,
1 marked the five lines with a razor and the point of intersection
indicated the center of gravity. I measured the distance from this point to
the anterior lip and the dorsal margin of the fish. (see Figure 1)
Mathematical Analysis
To hover in equilibrium, the net translational forces and the net
torques acting on a fish must equal zero. The three translational axes are
vertical, transverse, and along the long axis of the fish, each passing
through the center of gravity. The three types of torques are pitch, roll.
and yaw. I chose to examine the pitch of the long axis of the fish about
the transverse axis through the center of gravity, the roll of the vertical
