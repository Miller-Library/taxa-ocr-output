Mathematical Analysis
The only force which was not calculated above was the force due to
the caudal fin. I examined two cases. In Case 1, I set the net torques in
equilibrium and solved for Fcf. This value was used in the vertical
translation equation to examine the net vertical force on the fish as a
function of pitch or roll. In Case 2, I reversed the process, setting the
translational forces equal to zero, solving for Fcf, and examining the net
torque at a particular angle &am to horizontal. The results are presented in
Figures 6-9.
PITCHING
Case 1: Rotational Equilibrium Examine Net Translation
The intersection of the force line with zero force in Figure 6
indicates a point of equilibrium. At an angle of slightly more than twenty
degrees, the net vertical force and the net torque are both zero. At this
angle, the fish is oriented with its head slightly tilted down. The small
change in the net vertical force with the change in angle at this point
indicates a relatively stable equilibrium. The translational force at +10
& Â«130 degrees range from 418.65 to-287.02 dynes, a fairly small
force. Thus, the fish can hover in rotational equilibrium with a small
amount of vertical movement over a wide range of angles.
Case 2: Translational Equilibrium examine Net Torque
The torques due to Fpf and Fef are constant. The effect of the
caudal fin is to turn the fish in a positive sense, sending the head of the
fish down. The torque caused by the pectoral fins rotates the fish in the
opposite direction, but does not balance the torque due to the tail.
Although the net torque reaches equilibrium in Figure 7 at the same
angle that the vertical forces do in Figure 8, it is a relatively unstable
