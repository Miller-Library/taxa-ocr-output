APPENDICES
APPENDIX 1:
The four forces I examined for vertical translational equilibrium
were those due to the weight acting at the center of gravity, the
buoyancy acting at the center of buoyancy, the pectoral fins and the tail
fins (see Figure 3). The Feb and Feg are vertical and oppose each other.
Fef was assumed to always perpendicular to the radius between the
caudal fin and the center of buoyancy. It therefore varled as the angle to
horizontal changed. The Fpf is perpendicular to the plane of the pectoral
fin. To find the net vertical force of the pectoral fins, I first simplified the
Fpf into its perpendicular and parallel components (see Figure 2). I then
found the vertical components of these two forces. The sum of Fpf.L.y and
Fpf. v is the net vertical force of the pectoral fin.
