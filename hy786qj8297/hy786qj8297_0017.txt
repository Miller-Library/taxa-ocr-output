APPENDIX 3:
The equations for rolling torque and for vertical translational force
were much simpler. They only involved two or three forces (see Figure
5). The caudal fin force was assumed not to contribute in this case. The
right pectoral fin force was simplified by assumung that only the
per pendicular component contributes to rolling motion. The parallel
component is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. The assumptions
asserted in the previous two appendices are also valid for this case.
