APPENDIX 2:
The three forces which contribute to the net torque are Fcb, Fpf,
and Fcf. The torque caused by Feb changes with the angle to horizontal.
The torque caused by Fef is constant because Fef is perpendicular to Rcf.
The pectoral fins are more complex. I once again broke the Fpf into its
perpendicular and parallel components. I found the torque due to these
two forces and used this as the net torque caused by the pectoral fin.
