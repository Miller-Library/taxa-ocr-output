also the range of depths at which the effect of waves, tides, and surge is
at a maximum. Nearshore fish live in an incredibly unstable environment
yet are able to hover in a state approaching equilibrium. The fish could
increase their stability by slightly altering their horizontal orientation
while in rotational equilibrium. The fish can thus compensate for changes
in their environment by altering the angle at which they are in rotational
equilibrium and undergoing small vertical movements.
The high degree of rolling instability when the fish is lying on its
left side and the large pectoral fin force needed to return the fish to
vertical correlate well with my results from anesthetizing the left
pectoral fin. The mathematical model de monstrates that it is difficult for
a fish to use just its right pectoral fin and swim normally. An increase in
the frequency of fin strokes causes the fish to swim on its left side along
Ã  constant horizontal plane. In the wild, a fish with an injured pectoral fin
would be at severe disadvantage. It would have no control over its
orientation and could become easy prey. This illustrates the importance
to a fish of having control over the unstable system created by the
swimbladder.
The development of a technique for locating the center of
buoyancy opens up a new approach for studying fish mechanics. I only
examined three out of the six conditions necessary for total equilibrium,
For a comprehensive study of the effects of the buoyant force and the fin
forces, the model l presented can be expanded to include the other three
axes. It would also be interesting to look for physical differences between
fish of the same species which hover in different orientations.
