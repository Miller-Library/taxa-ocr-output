The experimental fish's total length was 27.5 cm and had a weight
in air of 302.85 g. The thickest cross section, measured at the insertion of
the pectoral fins, was 4.0 cm while the doral-ventral depth was 7.6 cm.
The weight of the fish in water was 1.2 g and its weight in water after I
deflated the swimbladder was 15.4 g. The pectoral fins were 2.2 cm wide
at the base, had an area of 26.1 cm2. The pectoral fins were slightly more
than 7/ cm long, and the dorsal edge at the insertion was 7.5 cm from the
anterior lip of the fish and 5.2 cm from the dorsal margin. The center of
buoyancy (CB) ws 9.5 cm from the anterior lip of the fish and 4.8 cm from
the dorsal margin. The center of gravity (CG) was 10.4 cm from the
anterior lip and 4.0 cm from the dorsal margin of the fish. (see Figure 1)
From the above data, I calculated the constants needed to solve the
torque and translational force equations. The downward force due to the
weight of the fish was 15107.4 dynes and the buoyant force was 14292.4
dynes. Because Fwt is greater than Feb, there is a net negative force and
the fish would slowly sink if it did not compensate using its pectoral and
caudal fins. The radius (rcb) from the center of buoyancy to the center of
gravity was 1.2 cm and the angle J between this radius and the long
axis of the fish was 38.42 degrees. The radius (rpf) from the center of
gravity and the center at which the pectoral force acted was 3.7 cm and
the angle ÃŸ between this radius and the long axis of the fish was
41.63 degrees. The radius (ref) from the center of gravity to the center at
which the caudal fin forces acted was 12.5 cm. This radius fell along the
same line as the long axis of the fish.
From a videotape of a hovering kelp rockfish, I calculated the
angular velocity of the pectoral fins during adduction as approximately
pi/2 radians per second. The angle  of the plane of the fin to the long
axis of the fish was about 60 degrees. The calculated force of the pectoral
fin (Fpf) is 644 dynes.
