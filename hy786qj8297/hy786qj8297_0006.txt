lalso examined the roll of the fish about its long axis. In this case,
& is the angle between the dorsal-ventral axis of the fish and vertical.
The following equations are evaluated for angles from 490 to-90 degrees,
The fish is oriented to an upright position at 0 degrees and lying on its
left side at +90 degrees.
In this case, I assumed that the tail fin has no effect on roll or
vertical movement. The equations are set up to simulate the conditions of
the pectoral fin injections, i.e. that only the right pectoral fin was being
used. Only the vertical component of the pectoral fin force contributed to
the roll torque.
The net torque is:
Tnet -Ech Epf
The net translational force is:
Fnet - Fcb -Fwt + Fpf.y
For force diagrams and derivations, see Appendix 3 and Figure 5.

Initial trials showed the effects of the general anesthetic.
quinaldine. After returning the anesthetized fish to fresh sea water,
they were initially belly-up with their head near the surface of the water.
The pectoral fins were extended sideways. Approximately thirty seconds
after entering the tank the fish sank to the bottom and came to rest
belly-up. The first movement was a slow rocking from side to side. After
fifteen to thirty seconds, the fish began swimming movements using both
the pectoral fins and the caudal fin, bringing it upright on the bottom. The
fish came to rest leaning on one pectoral fin and then shifted to lean on
