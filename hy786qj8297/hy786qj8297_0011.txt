At slightly less than -10 degrees, the fish is stable. The rate of change of
the torque with angle to vertical is large enough that further rotation in
either direction will cause him to roll away from equilibrium. The net
torque between -10 and 0 changes by 1960 dyne cm. The Fpf needed to
return to equilibrium rapidly gets very large. For a 10 degree roll, over
1000 dynes are needed to return to a stable state. The torque is again
much more sensitive to changes in the angle to vertical.
DISCUSSION
These data suggest that it is advantageous for the kelp rockfish fish
to be in rotational equilibrium and allow itself a slight vertical movement.
From an examination of pitching and rolling rotations relative to the
vertical stability of the fish, it is seen that the rate of change of the
torque with the angle is much greater than the rate of change of the
vertical force with angle. The fish can tolerate a range of angles with a
small amount of vertical movement. In contrast, the torque is much more
sensitive to altering the angle.
These findings correlate well with observations made at Monterey
Bay Aquarium. The kelp and blue rockfish in the large kelp tank hovered
using only their tail and pectoral fins. Each individual seemed to have a
preferred angle &a to the horizontal which they maintained within a few
degrees. At the same time, they would slowly sink a distance from a few
inches to approximately a foot. The fish then used a few tail flicks to
return to their previous depth and orientation. This cycle was repeated
several times during the period that I made my observations. These fish
undergo vertical migrations as a part of their daily and life cycle to feed
reproduce, and hide from predators. The most dramatic changes in
relative pressure occur within the first 33 feet below the surface. This is
