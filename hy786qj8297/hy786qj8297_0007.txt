the other fin. This tipping continued for about two and one half minutes
The fish then began to swim around the tank, slowly but with a normal
orientation. The fish alternated swimming with periods of resting on the
bottom. The amount of leaning decreased with time. The fish appeared to
have fully recovered from the anesthetic by fourteen and one half
minutes in the fresh sea water.
After injecting the left pectoral muscle area with dibucaine, their
initial behavior was the same as above. The first tail movements began
about one and three-quarters to two minutes after entering the tank. The
fish attempted to come to vertical, but could not, instead hovering
horizontally on their left side. The left pectoral fin stuck out from the
body at appproximately 90 degrees. The fish began to swim while still in
their sideways orientation after about two and one half minutes. They
swam in a circle about the axis of the left fin using mostly the right
pectoral fin. The fish increased the velocity of right fin rowing motions
but remained on their left side. This continued for one and one quarter
minutes when the fish settled on the bottom in an upright position,
leaning to the left and resting on the left pectoral fin. The fish stayed
there for several minutes, occasionally beating their right pectoral fin or
moving their tail sinusoidally. With time, their orientation became
increasingly vertical, but at eight minutes the left pectoral fin had not
regained its full range of motion. At nine and one half minutes or after a
long period of inactivity, I poked the fish and forced them to swim.
Swimming was now upright, but sluggish. Full recovery occured from
thirteen to eighteen minutes after exposure to quinaldine.
Center of Buoyancy
The density of the salt solution, and thus the density of the fish
without its swimbladder was 1.0792 g/cm3.
