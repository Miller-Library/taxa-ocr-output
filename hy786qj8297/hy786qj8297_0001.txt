ABSTRACT
The kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) hovers at a range of angles
to horizontal using slow movements of its pectoral and caudal fins. It
adjusts its buoyancy using a swimbladder, which increases the volume of
the fish without increasing its mass and thus reduces its net density. I
found that the center of buoyancy, the point at which the force due to the
swimbladder acts, is anterior and ventral to the center of gravity. This
creates rotational instability. I formed a model to examine the effects of
the buoyant force, the force due to gravity, and the forces of the pectoral
and caudal fins on the rotational and vertical translational equilibria of
the fish. 1 found that the net torque is much more sensitive to changes in
the angle of the fish than is the net vertical force.
INTRODUCTION
The teleost swimbladder is a specialized organ forming a gas-filled
space within the body cavity of a fish. Although a fish can control the
volume of its swimbladder by secreting or resorbing gasses, this is a slow
process which occurs over several hours. The swimbladder is inherently
instable due to the inverse relationship between pressure and the volume
of Ã  gas in an enciosed space. If a fish in equilibrium moves down even
slightly, the ambient pressure increases and its swimbladder is
compressed. As a result, the fish becomes denser and begins to sink
faster. Conversely, if the same fish is moved above its usual depth, the
reduction in pressure causes the gasses in the swimbladder to expand.
sending the fish towards the surface of the water. Fish caught at depth
and brought rapidly to the surface have trouble swimming normally and
often are seen with their swimbladder expanded into the mouth cavity,
