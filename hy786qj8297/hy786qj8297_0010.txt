equilibrium. The rapid rate of change of the net torque with the change
of angle to horizontal at this point demonstrates that the torque is very
sensitive to changes in orientation. The slightest deviation from this angle
will cause the fish to rotate. At +10 « &amp «430, torque ranges from¬
5313.77 to +4142.82 dynes cm and rapily increases at greater angles. If
the fish maintains translational equilibrium, there is only one angle at
which it will not pitch.
ROLLING
Case 1: Rotational Equilibrium. Examine Net Translation
The vertical force due to Fcb and Fwt is constant and negative. The
fish must compensate with its right pectoral fin or sink. In Figure 8, the
angle at which the fish is in rotational and vertical equilibrium is slightly
greater than -10 degrees. At this angle, the fish is leaning slighly to its
right. The vertical component of the right pectoral fin force is sufficient to
offset the net negative force of the fish and the fish does not roll. The rate
of change of the vertical force with change in the angle is relatively small.
The net translational force between -10 and 0 degrees ranges from 162.6
and -815 dynes. Although the fish can only use one pectoral fin, it is still
able to maintain a state of rolling equilibrium over a range of angles with
à small amount of vertical movement. The vertical force of the pectoral
fin must be a minimum of +815 dynes to keep itself from sinking
rapidly. Very little additional force from the pectoral fin is needed for a
wide range of angles (see Figure 10). Between -40 or +40 degrees and 0
degrees there is an increase in the Fpf of only 249 dynes.
Case 2 : Translational Equilibrium Examine Net Torque
The torques due to Feb and Fpf either act in the same direction or
oppose each other, depending on whether the fish is leaning to its left or
right. There is one point of net equilibrium in Figure 9 for the rolling fish.
