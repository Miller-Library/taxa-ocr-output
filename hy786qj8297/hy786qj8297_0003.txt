The blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus) and kelp rockfish (Sebastes
atrovirens) were caught at depths of 5 to 20 feet in the vicinity of
Hopkins Marine Station.
Injections
The reaction of a fish to the inability to use a fin was examined by
selectively anesthetizing fins. A quinaldine solution consisting of three
drops quinaldine (202 isopropyl) in 900 ml sea water was used as a
general anesthetic. The fish were immersed in this solution for one to one
and one half minutes or until they were easy to handle. I held the fish
firmly, leaving a pectoral muscle exposed, and injected the fish with
approximately 0.3 cc dibucaine (200 microM) subder mally with a fine
needle. I returned the fish to a large, deep (30 cm) tank of sea water. The
fish were observed for fifteen to twenty minutes. I recorded the fish's
orientation, pectoral and caudal fin use, swimming or resting behaviors,
and recovery times. As a control, I also observed the effects of just
quinaldine. After completing observations, I allowed each fish a minimum
of 24 hours to recover between injections.
Center of Buoyancy
To find the center of buoyancy, a kelp rockfish was immersed in a
tank of saltwater, the density of which had been adjusted to that of a fish
without a swimbladder. When the fish was tethered to a line and
sub merged, the only force present was the buoyancy of the swimbladder
and the fish rotated until the center of buoyancy lay above the pivot
point. This line was marked by a string held vertical by a float. By
tethering the fish at five different points (the base of the caudal fin, the
insertion of the anal fin, anterior to the pelvic fins, at the insertion of the
dorsal fin, and at the break between spiny rays and soft rays of the
dorsal fin) I marked five lines on the fish's skin, the point of their
