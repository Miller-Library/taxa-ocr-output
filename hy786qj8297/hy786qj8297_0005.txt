axis about the long axis through the center of gravity, and the vertical
translation.
I calculated the vertical and rotational equilibria for the fish for a range
of angles &, between the long axis of the fish and horizontal. The fish
was oriented such that at &am -+90 degrees, it was vertical with its head
pointing down.
For purposes of calculating the vertical translational forces acting
on the fish, I assumed that the force from the caudal fin (Fcf) is always
perpendicular to the long axis of the body. I then calculated the vertical
component (Fcf.y) of this force from
Fcf,y - Fef (cos &).
The forces due to gravity (Fwt) and to the swimbladder acting at the
center of buoyancy (Fch) are always vertical, parallel, and acting in
opposite directions to each other. I resolved the pectoral fin force (Fpf)
into a net vertical force (Fpf.y) by examining the perpendicular and
parallel components of (Fpf) relative to 0, the angle of the plane of the
fin to the long axis of the fish. (see Appendix 1 and Figure 2)
Fpf,y -Fpf lcos 0 cos & -sin O sin & l.
The net vertical translational force as shown in Figure 1 is:
Fnet - Fcb -Fwt + Fpf,y + Fcf.y
In calculating the net torque about the center of gravity, I assumed
that the caudal fin force is always perpendicular to the radius (Rcf)
between the point at which the force acted and the center of gravity. The
pectoral fin force is always perpendicular to the plane of the pectoral fin.
The force due to the swimbladder is vertical so the effect of buoyancy
varied with the angle &a to the horizontal. For a complete derivation and
force diagrams, see Appendix 2 and Figure 4. The net torque on the fish
