FIGURE 1: Diagram of a S atrovirens marked with locations of key
anatomical points. All abbreviations are explained in the text.
FIGURE 2: Force diagram of the pectoral fin forces. Fpf is broken into
perpendicular and parallel components. These components are used to
determine net vertical force. Explanations in the text.
FIGURE 3: Force diagram of the vertical translational forces acting on
the fish. (a) is the angle of the fish from horizontal. Explanations in
text.
FIGURE 4: A side view of the pitching rotational forces on the fish. The
long axis is rotating about the transverse axis through the center of
gravity.
FIGURE 5: A cross sectional view of the fish looking along the long axis
from posterior to anterior end. The torques and vertical forces are
both shown. Positive torque is oriented counterclockwise.
FIGURE 6: Graph of the net translational force versus the angle (a)
from horizontal. The net pitching torque has been set to equal zero.
FIGURE 7: Graph of the net pitching torque versus the angle from
horizontal. The net vertical force has been set to equal zero.
FIGURE 8: Graph of the net vertical force versus the angle from
vertical. The net rolling torque has been set to equal zero. The fish can
only use its right pectoral fin.
FIGURE 9: Graph of the net rolling torque versus the angle from
vertical. The net vertical force has been set to equal zero. The fish can
only use its right pectoral fin.
FIGURE 10: Graph of the right pectoral force needed for equilibrium
versus angle from vertical. The crosses represent Case 1 - net rolling
torque set to zero. The squares represent Case 2 - net vertical force set
to zero.
