Introduction
Atrazine is a s-triazine herbicide that has been used for over 40 years to kill broad
leaf and grassy weeds by inhibition of photosynthesis [fig 1). It is used in over 80
countries (Hayes et al., 2002), and in the U.S. alone accounts for 86% of herbicides. The
U.S., primarily the Midwest, uses 76.4 million pounds per year. Atrazine is applied to
76% of the corn grown in the U.S. as well as to sorghum, sugarcane, wheat, guava,
macadamia nuts, hay, summer fallow, forestry, Christmas trees, sod, and residential turf
(parks, golf courses, private lawns).
Given the large amount of atrazine in the environment, toxicological studies on
atrazine are very important. The LD5O in rats is 1.75 ppm (Islam, 2001). However, there
have been reported effects at concentrations which are approximately 1000 times lower.
Atrazine has been reported by the EPA to cause neuroendocrine effects in rats at
concentrations of 18 ppb. The most recent and perhaps most striking study found that
concentrations of atrazine down to 0.1 ppb induced hermaphroditism and demasculation
of the larynges of male African clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis (Hayes et al., 2002). At
concentrations as low as 25 ppb, there was a tenfold decrease in testosterone in these
frogs. It was proposed that atrazine decreased testosterone production and increased
estrogen production.
These toxicological studies have been limited and targeted specific systems such
as the endocrine system. This study investigates the toxicity of atrazine on a more general
cellular mechanism. This mechanism is the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)
mechanism and is one of two ways in which cells deal with toxicants. In the first
mechanism the toxicant enters the cell and is broken down or converted to other
