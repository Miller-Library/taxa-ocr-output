enter with no competitive substrate. However, atrazine does not appear to affect the
development of Lytechinus pictus embryos at 2 uM.
Although each experiment assessing the effects of atrazine on mussels indicated
that atrazine was a significant substrate, there were significant differences in the levels of
rhodamine accumulation between the different experiments (different animals). These
differences in individual specimens have been observed in other studies, and have been
attributed to the differing levels of p-glycoprotein. The MXR response in Mytilus
californianus is induced (increased p-glycoprotein levels and efflux activity) in response
to environmental stresses (Eufemia and Epel, 2000). With lower levels of p-glycoprotein
activity, cells would naturally allow more rhodamine to accumulate than would cells with
high levels of p-glycoprotein. This relationship was expressed by Smital et al. (2000) as
an r-ratio. This ratio is the rhodamine control fluorescence divided by the verapamil
fluorescence in a given mussel. R-ratios ranged from zero to one, with numbers close to
one having very little p-glycoprotein activity, and levels close to zero having very high p-
glycoprotein activity.
Variations in p-glycoprotein efflux activity could explain the differences in the
basal fluorescence seen in the controls of the various mussels. The R-ratios were
determined for the mussels used in Figures 5-8 and were 0.281, 0.302, 0.130 and 0.146
respectively. The R-ratios of mussels A and B [fig. 5-6) were significantly different to a
0.01 level from the r-ratios of mussels C and D. The average of the r-ratios of A and B
was 2.12X the average of r-ratios of C and D [fig. 7-8). In order to determine whether
this 2.12-fold difference was consistent for all concentrations, the ratios of other
concentrations were determined. This difference was seen; the average of the
