The fluorescence intensity of the tissue samples was viewed and measured using
an epifluorescent microscope with a rhodamine filter and a 16X objective. A camera
(Hamamatsu, model C2400-08) was linked to the microscope as well as a PC with a
Universal lmage processing system (Image-1) for analysis of data. The sensitivity and
intensity of the light on the microscope was set at the beginning of the experiment and
left untouched for the rest of the experiment in order to insure consistency of results. For
each piece of gill tissue, five fluorescence intensities of a 150-pixil area were recorded. In
addition, three background intensities were recorded. The methods for averaging these
recordings are described below in the statistics section.
Rhodamine Accumulation Concentration Series for 1 Hour
While previously dissected and cut gill tissue pieces incubated at 15 °C, 35 x 10
mm petri dishes with five mL fresh seawater were set up with the following
concentrations: 0.6 uM Rhodamine B/20 uM verapamil; 0.6 uM Rhodamine B/2 uM
DMSO; 0.6 uM Rhodamine B only, and 0.6uM Rhodamine B with various
concentrations of atrazine. DMSO controls were set up for threé of the four mussels
examined.
Five to six pieces of gill tissue were placed in each petri dish at one concentration
and incubated at 15 °C. The incubations were staggered with a ten minute interval
between the initiation of each incubation at each concentration. After 1 hour the pieces of
tissue were removed and immediately washed for 15 seconds in fresh seawater. The
tissue pieces were laid flat on new petri dishes and viewed under the microscope. The
relative intensity of a 100-pixil area was determined for each tissue.
