accumulates in cells at low levels as it is a MXR substrate and is constantly effluxed from
the cell. However, when rhodamine B is put into solution with a chemical which are
substrates or inhibitors of the p-glycoprotein, rhodamine B accumulates in the cell at
much higher levels; the MXR mechanism is basically overwhelmed by such multiple
substrates or inhibitors. Therefore, even if a chemical itself may not cause adverse
cellular effects, as an MXR substrate it would allow other more hazardous toxicants to
enter the cells.
I chose to determine whether atrazine was an MXR substrate for several reasons:
atrazine is hydrophobic, the end destination of much agricultural run-off is the ocean, and
for many sessile marine organisms, the MXR mechanism may be their last line of defense
against toxicants. I also looked at the effect of atrazine on the development of embryos of
the sea urchin, Lytechinus pictus.
Atrazine was found to be an MXR substrate and to significantly inhibit MXR at
concentrations as low as 0.6 uM. There were no observed developmental effects on
Lytechinus pictus. This study raises the concern that even if atrazine itself is present at
non-toxic doses, its inhibition of MXR could make cells more vulnerable to other
toxicants which normally would not enter the cells.
