Developmental Effects on Lytechinus pictus
One female and one male Lytechinus pictus were spawned. The eggs were
fertilized and allowed to develop in 2 uM, .5 uM, and .1 uM solutions in 30 mL beakers.
There were two beakers of each concentration, as well as a DMSO control and two
seawater controls. The beakers were covered in parafilm and allowed to develop at room
temperature. The embryos were examined and compared to controls are various time
points. The skeleton morphology was studied by lysing five day old embryos in a 2.5%
SDS (in dionized water) solution, and then skeletons were examined microscopically at
160x and 400x magnifications.
Statistics
For both the rhodamine accumulation over time as well as the concentration
series, the same procedure was used to average the intensity recordings. The five
intensity readings for each tissue were averaged as were the three background readings.
The average background reading was subtracted from the average tissue fluorescence
reading. The readings with background adjustment were then averaged across the five
tissue samples to produce a mean, final fluorescence intensity at that concentration. The
differences between these means and their respective controls were determined using the
Student's t-test to a significance of P-0.01.
