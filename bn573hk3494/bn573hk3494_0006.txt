removed from the intact gills with forceps. The gills were then cut into approximately
Amm x 4mm pieces. Effort was made to have the gill pieces be only one tissue layer thick
by teasing apart with forceps the ascending and descending arms of the gill tissue
(Cornwall et al., 1995). The 4mm x 4mm pieces of tissue were incubated at 15 °C for 15
minutes in a separate petri dish with fresh seawater in order to let excess mucus flush out.
At the end of the 15 minute incubation, excess clumps of mucus were removed again
from the pieces of tissue with forceps. All gill tissue was used for experimentation within
one hour of dissection.
Rhodamine Accumulation in Gill Tissue Over Time.
While the gill tissue pieces were incubating in seawater (as above) to remove
mucus, 35 x 10 mm petri dishes were set up with five mL of fresh seawater each and the
following substrate or inhibitor concentrations: 0.6 uM Rhodamine B/ SuM verapamil;
0.6 uM Rhodamine B/ SuM Atrazine; and 0.6 uM Rhodamine B only. Preliminary
experiments showed that a 0.6 uM rhodamine concentration was in the range to detect
efflux activity accurately.
Six to seven pieces of gill tissue were placed in each petri dish and incubated at
15 °C. After intervals of 30, 45, and 60 minutes, one or two pieces of gill tissue were
removed from each solution. The tissues were immediately washed with fresh seawater
by immersion in 300 mL of seawater for 15 seconds and then laid flat on a new petri dish
with no water except the moisture that came with the tissue itself. Tissues were viewed
under the microscope within five minutes of removal from solution.
