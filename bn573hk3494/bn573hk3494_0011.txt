the rhodamine control were determined to be insignificant with a Studentâ€™s two-tailed t-
test. Therefore, this composite data confirms that atrazine significantly acts as an MXR
substrate down to 0.6 uM.
DMSO controls were used in most experiments in order to insure that any
differences in rhodamine fluorescence were attributable to atrazine and not the DMSO in
which it was dissolved. AIl DMSO controls in this experiment were not significant
compared to the rhodamine-only controls.
Developmental Effects on Lytechinus pictus
There were no clear timing or morphological differences in the Lytechinus pictus
embryos exposed to various concentrations of atrazine (0.1-2 uM). The spicule skeletons
of the embryos were examined after three days for any differences attributable to
atrazine. There were some skeletal defects, but they occurred in both the seawater
control, DMSO control, and at all atrazine concentrations; therefore, the defects could not
be attributed to atrazine or DMSO. In both the controls [fig. 21 and experimentals,
observed defects included overly curved larger legs and curved portions of the smaller
legs not coming together [fig. 3]. However, there were no apparent developmental effects
attributable to atrazine (2uM) on Lytechinus pictus embryos.
Discussion
This study shows that atrazine is an MXR substrate and significantly inhibits
multixenobiotic resistance down to a concentration of 0.6 uM. At this concentration,
atrazine allowed approximately 24% more rhodamine into the cell than would normally
