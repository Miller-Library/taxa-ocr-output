compounds through the cytochrome P450 system (Livingstone, 1990) or conjugating
system which makes the toxicant more water soluble (Ortiz de Montellano, 1986). A
problem with this system is that the toxicant must enter the cell and it could damage the
cell before the toxicant is altered.
The second mechanism of detoxification is the MXR mechanism, first identified
in human tumor cells, which actively exports moderately hydrophobic chemicals which
diffused into the cell of cell plasma membrane (Dano, 1973; Gottesman et al., 1991.)
This transport occurred through an ATP-dependent, transmembrane, 170 kDa p-
glycoprotein. These proteins are part of a larger family of proteins, named the ABC
proteins, which are generally specified for transport (Epel, 1998).
The p-glycoproteins active in the MXR mechanism have been identified in human
tissue in the kidney, adrenal gland, liver, the blood-testes barrier (Cordon-Cardo et al.,
1990), and the blood brain barrier (Watchko et al., 1998). Since then, a related 170 kDa
p-glycoprotein has been detected and identified in many other organisms by genetics, by
activity measurements, and by immunological probes. The MXR mechanism is present in
many aquatic organisms such as fresh water and marine mussels including Mytilus
californianus (Cornwall et al., 1995). Ã–ther marine organisms with MXR are sponges
(Kurelec et al., 1992), snails (Kurelec et al., 1995a), clams (Waldmann et al., 1995) and
worms (Toomey and Epel, 1993). The MXR mechanism has been suggested as a first line
of defense against xenobiotics in aquatic environments (Epel, 1998).
An assay using the accumulation of a radiolabeled or fluorescent substance was
designed in order to detect MXR activity (Kurelec et al., 1992; Toomey and Epel, 1993;
Kurelec et al., 2000). Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye which normally only
