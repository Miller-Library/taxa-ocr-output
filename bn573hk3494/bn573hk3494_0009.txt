Kinetics of Rhodamine Accumulation in Gill Tissue
The kinetics of rhodamine accumulation in the presence and absence of atrazine
or verapamil is shown in Figure 4. At all three time points of 30, 45 and 60 minutes, the
rhodamine accumulation in the atrazine treated solutions were well above the control and
approaching the levels seen with verapamil. Similar results were seen with 4 uM atrazine
(results not shown). As seen in Figure 4, there are larger standard deviations at 60
minutes, which I attribute to mucus accumulation with resultant high fluorescence. This
variation (and excess mucus) were not seen later in the experiments (fig. 5-8) as my skills
at removing mucus improved.
The Effects of Different Concentrations of Atrazine
In the next set of experiments, time was a constant, and tissue samples were taken
at one hour since the above kinetics experiment indicated a maximum concentration was
reached after one hour. This procedure allowed for a comparison of different atrazine
concentrations in order to determine the lowest concentration at which atrazine would
significantly inhibit MXR.
A range of atrazine concentrations from 12 uM to 0.6 uM were used. As seen in
Figure 5, atrazine affects the MXR at all concentrations; even 0.6 uM was significantly
different than the Rhodamine control.
Since the series in Figure 5 showed significant effects of atrazine at 0.6 uM, a
new series was done at 0.6 uM and below to ascertain the minimal level where atrazine
