Acknowledgments
I want to thank David Epel for inspiring this project, providing constant support
and suggestions as I reached apparent dead ends, and putting up with my mathematically-
challenged nature; Chris Patton for his much needed technical assistance; Becky, Todd,
and Cathy for including me into the lab, answering my questions, and making jokes; and
finally the many sea urchins and mussels which gave their lives for this project.
