Abstract
Atrazine, a s-triazine herbicide, is the most widely used herbicide in the U.S. and
is also used in over 80 countries. It is of concern since after spring rains and by leeching
processes, atrazine and its breakdown products (considered equally as toxic) enter water
supplies, streams, and other major bodies of water. It reaches levels in community water
systems up to 89 ppb, in rivers basins up to 131 ppb, in drinking water up to 12 ppb, and
even in rainfall up to 40 ppb. Atrazine alters neuroendocrine function, causes mammary
tumors in rats, and a recent study showed demasculation and hermaphroditism in frogs at
concentrations as low as 1 ppb.
This study determined whether atrazine could compromise the multixenobiotic
resistance (MXR) mechanism which is a mechanism for preventing toxicants from
entering cells. I found that atrazine affects the normal functioning of MXR in the gill
tissue of the mussel Mytilus californianus down to a concentration of 0.6 uM (127 ppb).
Atrazineâ€™s effect on development was also examined and was found to have no effect on
the development of the sea urchin, Lytechinus pictus at a concentration of 2 uM (423
ppm).
The high levels of atrazine in aquatic environments due to agricultural runoff,
coupled with the significant effects of atrazine on the MXR mechanism raises concern
over the health of other marine organisms. Atrazine's inhibition of the MXR substrate
potentially could allow other toxic or carcinogenic agents to enter cells and adversely
affect the health of marine communities.
