fluorescence of the 0.6 uM atrazine concentration for mussel A and B was 2.1 5X the 0.6
uM concentration for mussel D (no value was available for mussel C).
The higher R-ratios in mussels A and B imply a reduced level of MXR activity
compared to mussels C and D. This explains why the control rhodamine fluorescence for
mussels A and B was higher than it was in mussels C and D at similar test-
concentrations. Therefore, taking into consideration the differences in p-glycoprotein
activity between the mussels, most of the variation between results appears to be
attributable to the innate difference in MXR activity in these individual mussels, rather
than procedural errors. Most importantly, atrazine had the same effect on these different
groups.
The lowest concentration at which atrazine showed significant effects on MXR
activity in Mytilus californianus was 0.6 uM or 127 ppb; is this level environmentally
significant? A concentration of 127 ppb is of concern when considering the most recent
EPA report on atrazine risk assessment (EPA, 2002). In an assessment of community
water systems (CWS) in areas of atrazine use, 29 CWS had levels of contamination
higher than 12.5 ppb, and one was recorded at 89 ppb. The maximum level of
contamination in rural wells examined was 89 ppb, and eight of 1505 wells examined had
levels over 12.5 ppb (EPA, 2002). Among streams analyzed in Ohio, 13 flowing into
Lake Erie had concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 23.2 ppb. In the North Ohio Sandusky
river basin, eight sites had concentrations of atrazine ranging from 1-45.7 ppb. In the
Cape Fear River basin, North Carolina, 35% of the sites tested positive for atrazine with
an average of 5.6 ppm and a maximum of 131 ppb. In lowa concentrations of atrazine in
drinking water, rivers, water wells and reservoirs ranged up to 12 ppb. In a survey of
