agricultural watersheds in southern Ontario in 1975-1977, 80% of the stream waters had
1.4 ppb atrazine (Spectrum Laboratories, 2001). That was 25 years ago. Atrazine is even
detected in 40 ppb in rainfall in some areas of the Midwest (Hayes, et al., 2002).
Clearly these water concentrations of atrazine are of concern, but when taking
into consideration the fact that atrazine may bioconcentrate (up to 11-fold, Spectrum
Laboratories, 2001) or have effects due to exposure over long periods of time, the
situation becomes of even greater concern. Indeed, the EPA itself this year admitted that
neuoroendocrine effects observed in rats due to atrazine are "not unlikely" in humans
(EPA, April 2002). In addition, natural fluctuations of p-glycoprotein expression raise
concerns about the timing of exposure to toxicants like atrazine. P-glycoprotein
expression is reduced during the embryonic and newborn period of rats, and reaches adult
levels only after 21 days of maturation (Tsai, et al. 2002).
However, because atrazineâ€™s end destination is the aquatic environment, work is
also needed to investigate its effects in the marine realm. Specifically, research is needed
to determine concentrations of atrazine in marine waters, and whether marine organisms
are being affected. In addition, investigations are needed to determine whether other
herbicides or chemicals which are washed into marine waters are having similar adverse
effects of MXR activity or other biological functions.
Despite the numerous questions that still need to be answered regarding atrazine,
the work reported in this study adds a new dimension to understanding this herbicide.
Atrazine is not just a problem for humans or frogs, but is now identified as a possible
problem for aquatic organisms. Atrazine is a substrate for the MXR mechanism down to
levels of 127 ppb. Therefore, even if atrazine is present at low levels where it itself is not
