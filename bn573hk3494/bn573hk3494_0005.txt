average shell length of the mussels collected was 7.5 cm. The mussels were kept outdoors
in plastic containers with fresh, filtered continuously flowing seawater at approximately
15 °C. The mussels were used within six days of collection. Adult specimens of
Lytechinus pictus from Marinus, Venice, California were kept in glass tanks outdoors
with fresh, flowing seawater at approximately 15%
Chemicals.
Atrazine was ordered from Chemical Service Inc. (West Chester, PA). Stock
solutions of 10 mM, SmM, and 1mM were made by diluting Atrazine in DMSO. Stock
solutions were stored in plastic vials at room temperature. Rhodamine B was ordered
from Sigma. A ImM stock solution was made by diluting Rhodamine B in deionized
water. Verapamil was ordered from Sigma, and a 20 mM stock solution was made by
diluting verapamil in DMSO. Both the rhodamine B and verapamil stocks were kept in
15 ml polypropylene conical tubes covered in foil at room temperature.
Methods
The methods used for mussel gill preparation and the rhodamine accumulation assay
were modified from procedures described by Chan, 2000; Eufemia and Epel, 2000; and
Cornwall et al., 1995. The procedure with modifications is described below.
Preparation of Gill Tissue.
Gill tissue was removed intact from freshly dissected Mytilus californianus and
placed in a petri dish with fresh seawater at approximately 15 °C. Excess mucus was
