had an effect. As seen in Figure 6, 0.6 uM atrazine was not different from the control at a
significance level of p=0.01 (only p-0.05), and there was no difference at 0.1 and 0.01
atrazine concentrations. There was no effect of DMSO.
The next series attempted to find the effect of atrazine at concentrations between
0.4 uM and 0.1 uM in order to narrow down the range of MXR inhibition.
Concentrations of 0.4 uM, 0.2 uM, and the DMSO control were all similar compared to
the rhodamine control [fig. 71.
The final series, shown in Figure 8, duplicated some of the concentrations from
previous experiments. The atrazine concentration of 0.6 uM had an effect significant to
p-0.01, but differences between the 0.5 uM, 0.4 uM as well as the DMSO control were
not significant compared to the rhodamine control [fig. 81.
Because there were variations in the results obtained from each individual mussel
[fig. 5-8), the data was normalized. For a given mussel, the verapamil fluorescence was
assumed to represent the fluorescence which would occur given no MXR activity. This
assumption was valid, as verapamil is known to completely inhibit p-glycoprotein
activity. The fluorescence of each concentration including the rhodamine control was
divided by the fluorescence of the verapamil concentration. The resulting percentages
represented the percentage of the verapamil concentration fluorescence, or in other
words, the percent of MXR inhibition. Two of the concentrations had more than one
percentage value because it had been repeated more than once in the trials in Figures 5-8,
and these percentages were averaged and a standard error calculated [fig. 9. As seen, the
0.6 uM atrazine concentration resulted in 44.6% of the rhodamine fluorescence seen with
verapamil. The differences between the 0.5 uM and 0.4 uM atrazine concentrations and
