Fig 4. The effect of 5 uM atrazine on the kinetics of xenobiotic transport. Error bars are
standard error of the mean of 5 tissues at each time point.
Fig 5. The effect of different atrazine concentrations on rhodamine accumulation (mussel
A). Error bars are the standard error of the mean of five tissue samples per sample.
Significance (*) is determined to p-0.01.
Fig 6. The effect of different atrazine concentrations on rhodamine accumulation (mussel
B). Error bars are the standard error of the mean of five tissue samples per concentration.
Fig 7. The effect of different atrazine concentrations on rhodamine accumulation (mussel
C). Error bars are the standard error of the mean of five tissue sample per concentration.
Fig 8: The effect of different atrazine concentrations on rhodamine accumulation (mussel
D). Error bars are the standard error of the mean of five tissue sample per concentration.
Significance (*) is determined to p=0.01.
