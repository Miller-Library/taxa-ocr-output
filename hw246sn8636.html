Microalgae on Shell

INTRODUCTION
An extensive survey of the epizoic and endozoic
microalgae associated with the shell of a single species
of a living marine snail has never before been carried
out. The relative abundance of Tricolia pulloides
(Carpenter, 1865) around the Monterey Peninsula,
California (Firestone, 1979) and the smooth, semi¬
transparent character of the shell offered a convenient
opportunity for beginning such a survey.
The objective of this study was to identify the
microalgae found on the shells of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. pulloides</span> and to
investigate whether or not there existed differences
in species or quantity of microalgae on the shells be¬
tween a wave exposed coast and a wave protected coast.
This study also led to an investigation of the habit of
a green alga placed in the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chaetophoraceae : Exact'>Chaetophoraceae,</span> a family of
green algae not fully understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The specimens were gathered from four main study
areas on the Monterey Peninsula. Two areas, Point Pinos
and Point Joe, were on a wave exposed coast, and two
areas near Mussel Point were on a wave protected coast
(fig. 1). Three collection sites (+2.0 ft., +1.0 ft..
0.0 ft.) at each study area were selected relative
Microalgae on Shell
(3)
to 0.0 ft. tide level (mean low low water) and accor¬
ding to immediate macroalgal type (table 1). A sample
20 snails was collected at each site for culture
studies, and an additional sample of 20 snails was
preserved in 5% formalin for later observation. Col-
lections were made from May 10-15, 1979 during the neap
tides of that month.
The shell of each snail collected for culture
(240 in total) was cracked and the animal removed.
All shell fragments from five snails were placed in
separate plastic petri dishes (100xl5mm) containing
.45um filter-sterilized sea water enriched with modi-
fied Provasoli's media (Provasoli, McLaughlin, and Droop,
1957); 5 drops of Ge0» solution were added to each dish
to control diatoms. Two of the four shell cultures
from each collection site were placed at 15°0 with
constant light (40 watt, cool white, 46 microeinsteins
-2
-1
m sec ) and two were placed at 22°C with constant
light (40 watt, cool white, 150 microeinsteins müsec
After 6 and 9 days in culture, depending on the species,
specific microalgae were counted under a dissecting
microscope. Following the ninth day, samples of each
microalga were identified using a compound microscope
and photographed with a Nikon compound microscope
camera unit. The preserved snails were used to com¬
Microalgae on Shell
(4)
pare the microalgal forms in the field with those in
culture.
An additional 256 snails were sterilized in an auto-
clave (121 C, 20 lbs. pressure, 15 minutes). These
shells were then glued with epoxy to 4x8cm wood plates
(18 shells per plate), and the wood plates were bolted
to rocks at sites denoted in table 1, during May 10-15,
1979. The shells were examined for new growth of micro¬
algae after a 2-3 week period.
ESULTS
The results of this study are presented under three
categories: 1) frequencies of occurrence, 2) new growth
on sterilized shells, and 3) observations of form and
habit.
FREQUENCIES OF OCCURRENCE
Table 2 lists the microalgae encountered in field
and culture observations. Figure 1 depicts the numbers
of particular microalgae on the shells from the wave
protected coast and wave exposed coast study areas
as determined by culture counts. Figure 2 displays
the results of culture counts to determine frequency
differences between 15°0 cultures and 22 C cultures.
NEW GROWTH ON STERILIZED SHELLS
Table 2 shows that many species of algae observed
on the shells of living snails from the field were also
Microalgae on Shell
(5)
observed on sterilized shells after 3 weeks. Shells
placed at low sites showed the greatest amount of
new growth for any given area. On 10 shells from
a low site near Mussel Point the following new growth was
observed: 21 <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Enteromorpha : Exact'>Enteromorpha</span> sp. and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ulva : Exact'>Ulva</span> sp., 1 <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Erythrocladia subintegra : Exact'>Erythro-

OBSERVATIONS OF FORM AND HABIT
The following observations deal with those micro-
algae where the observed form or habit was of special
interest or differed from that hitherto described.
Conchocelis rosea Batters -- Shell-boring. Common at
all observed tidal heights. The thin, transparent
shell made possible direct observation under the com¬
pound microscope. Three distinct morphological forms
were observed. 1) Thin, usually straight filaments,
2.2um in width, with occasional short side branches.
Filaments contain very elongated pink cells (plate 1).
2) Thick to thin filaments, up to 9um in width, not
straight, branching common, becoming somewhat con¬
stricted between cells and near branchings, containing
pink somewhat elongated cells (plate 2). 3) Uniformally
thick filaments, 9um in width, cells dark in color, not
elongated, 4.5um in diameter (plate 3).
Microalgae on Shell
(6)
Erythrocladia subintegra Rosenvinge -- In culture, thallus
discoid, up to 224um in diameter. Cells in central
region polystromatic (plates 4,5).
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lyngbya : Exact'>Lyngbya</span> sp. -- A blue-green alga very common especially
on shells from the wave exposed coast. Often the entire
shell is covered with tufts of this alga. 139um in
length, 4um in width. Appeared colorless in all
cases (plate 6).
Pseudopringsheimia
apiculata Setchell & Gardner -- Com-
mon. Lends grass green color to many shells. Usually
epizoic on shell surface, occasionally endozoic under
protein coat of shell. Cross-section shows apiculate
tips and polystromatic growth up to 10 cells thick (67um)
(plate 7). Cells in cross-section are in vertical rows
and horizontally elongated (2 times as wide). Top view
of growth on shell surface (plates 8,9) shows areas of
monostromatic growth at the margins, including free ir-
regularly branched cells 2.2um in width and llum long.
Cells of central region of monostromatic growth from
top view are 2.7-3.Zum in diameter. Cells have single
pyrenoid, small rhizoids(?), and parietal(?) chloroplast.

SSION
FREQUENCIES OF OCCURRENCE
The results in figure 1 suggest that the wave ex¬
posed coast favors all the particular microalgae counted
with the exception of <span style='background-color:grey' title='Erythrotrichia carnea : Fuzzy'>Erythrotichia carnea.</span> These re¬
Microalgae on Shell
(7)
sults are reasonable assuming that the exposed coast
has more dissolved oxygen and nutrients available
due to increased water turbulence.
The results in figure 2 suggest that the red algae,
Erythrocladia subintegra and Erythrotrichia carnea, and
the brown alga, Feldmannia chitonicola, are not well
adapted to warm temperatures, though <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E. carnea</span> is
known from the tropics (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976).
This seems consistent with a paper by Hoek (1975) which
suggests that species of algae living abundantly in
cooler thermal regions are usually not well adapted
to live in warmer thermal regions. The results in
figure 2 may also be due at least in part to the difference
in light intensities to which the two sets of shell
cultures were exposed.
NEW GROWTH ON STERILIZED
SHELLS
New growth on the shells was surprising in view
of the short time period. These results bring up the
question of why the Tricolia pulloides in the field
are not overgrown with algae. At least 70% of the
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tricolia : Exact'>Tricolia</span> observed from the field were less than 50%
covered with microalgae. Another snail, however, the
limpet <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Collisella limatula : Exact'>Collisella limatula</span> Carpenter, often seen at the
same tidal height as the higher of the T. pulloides,
Microalgae on Shell
(8)
is commonly completely covered with algae. The T.
pulloides in the field are not as exposed to light
as were the sterilized shells or as are the shells of
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. limatula,</span> thus lack of sufficient light may account
for the lack of increased algal growth. Possibly
Tricolia pulloides graze upon each other or are
grazed upon by some other organism. Though such
grazing has been described for some intertidal snails
(Eikenberry and Wickizer, 1964) it was never observed
for T. pulloides in the field or in laboratory tanks
provided with macroalgal fronds. Such behavior was
only observed when snails were confined in small
containers without any other food. Yet another ex¬
planation is that the protein coat of Tricolia's shell
may inhibit algal growth. The question of why the
live T. pulloides in the field are only rarely more
than 50% covered with algae is a perplexing one which
I am unable to explain.
OBSERVATIONS OF FORM AND HABIT
Conchocelis rosea -- The fact that this shell-boring
alga was found in Tricolia's shells is an interesting
finding in itself. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Conchocelis : Exact'>Conchocelis,</span> an alternate morpho-
logical form of various <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porphyra : Exact'>Porphyra</span> species (Tseng and Chang,
1956; Hollenberg, 1958), may serve to insure the sur¬
vival of Porphyra during times when the intertidal
Microalgae on Shell
(9)
habitat is under stress owing to intense sunlight,
high temperatures, or lack of large waves. Conchocelis
phases are more resistant to these physical stresses
than the large, blade-like Porphyra plants. These
Conchocelis filaments in Tricolia shells are at ap¬
proxiamately the same tidal height as locally occur-
ring <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porphyra perforata : Exact'>Porphyra perforata</span> J. Agardh.
While an enormous amount of work has been done on
the form and habit of Conchocelis in culture (Drew, 1949,
1957; Kurogi, 1953; Tseng and Chang, 1955, 1956; Hollenberg,
1958; and Dixon and Richardson, 1969), little if any
extensive work has been done with Conchocelis in the
field. The shell of Tricolia pulloides has proved to
be an excellent place to observe Conchocelis in the field.
The three distinct morphological forms observed each
correspond to similiar forms described by Tseng and
Chang (1954) and locally by Hollenberg (1958) as dif¬
ferent stages of Conchocelis. It is of interest that
Hollenberg described the Conchocelis stage of locally
occurring Porphyra perforata as free-living (not shell¬
boring) while the Conchocelis filaments in Tricolia
shells may likely represent the Conchocelis stage of
Porphyra perforata in a shell-boring situation. The
shell of T. pulloides offers an opportunity for study
of the seasonal variations, if any, in the abundance
Microalgae on Shell
(10)
of the three observed forms of Conchocelis in the field.
ythrocladia subintegra -- This alga has been described
from the field as monostromatic (Abbott and Hollenberg.
1976), but according to Nichols and Lissant-(1967) <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Ery.
throcladia subintegra</span> in culture becomes polystromatic
with age, in agreement with this author's observations
in culture. This particular example demonstrates a
problem in present phycology, in that earlier descrip¬
tions of many species are based entirely on a few field
observations and often miss the morphological variability
present. This problem becomes more acute when one studies
inadequately defined taxa such as the genera and species
of the family Chaetophoraceae around the Monterey Peninsula.
Pseudopringsheimia apiculata -- Early descriptions of
many of the species of Chaetophoraceae described for
the Monterey Peninsula, including Pseudopringsheimia
apiculata, are based entirely on morphological attri-
butes observed in the field, often only on one or a
few hosts. Studies of thier habit, form, and pheno-
typic variability under a wide range of environmental
conditions have never been made. Yet, recent cultural
investigations of the family Chaetophoraceae by Wilkin-
son and Burrows (1972) and Yarish (1976) demonstrate
that serious taxonomic problems do exist in this family
due to earlier field descriptions which did not take
into account the extraordinary phenotypic plasticity
in members of this family.
Microalgae on Shell
(11)
It was within the above framework of knowledge
that this author had to work. Tables 3 and 4 illus-
trate the reasons for tenatively assigning the common
Chaetophoraceae alga seen on the shells to the genus
and species Pseudopringsheimia apiculata and also the
author's reservations about doing so. The differences
in habit between the alga on the shells and <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pseudopringsheimia apiculata : PartialExact'>Pseudo-
pringsheimia apiculata may</span> be due to a phenotypic
(not genotypic) difference resulting from the difference
in hosts from which the alga is being described. Yarish
(1976) concluded, "In the case of certain Chaetophoraceae
it is essential to culture the organisms to obtain
correct identification. Many species described in the
literature are probably ecophenes of a more limited
number of species." Comparative culture and field
studies of this alga and others in the Chaetophoraceae
from the Monterey Peninsula should be attempted in
order to better understand the taxonomy of this family.
