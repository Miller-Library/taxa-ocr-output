each species. For tnese animals, the wilth of the hard
carapice vas used is a measure of size, following Coffin
(1950), althouzh the curvature of the cartpace made such
measurement difficult. Eich specimen was ilso geasired
from the tip of the median tooth of the rostrim to the
tip of the V-shaped indentation on the posterior edge of
the carapace. Since this part of the key was degeloped
for ready use in the field, it also emphasizes coloratien
and patterning rather than minute merphological differences,
Examples of larval and post-largal charictenistics
were recorded with photographs and camera lucida dravings.

General larval characteristics may be found in

species: a vellow area anterier to the heart and dorsal
