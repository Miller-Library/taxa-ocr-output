character, i.e. all the species of Paguridae for which data
hive been published bear eight such procestes.
Tor
P. granosimanus this was found to be valid.
However, of saven specimens of P. hirsutiusculus
studjed, only one was found to have eight setae. Five
of the other six specimens had six setie and one specimen
had only five. On the specimen with five setae, one of
the medial setae apparently had been lost; while there
was no visible trace of its point of attachment, there
was a gap in the pattern. On the specimens pearing six
setie, no trices were seen which suggested the loss of any
processes.
On the basis of the specimens examined, the normal
number of setae appears to be six; nowever, in light.
of the one exception studied and the previously published
data on Paguridae, it is probaple that the numbor of
telson setae or the glaucothoe of P. hirsutiusculus is
also eight.
In his study of P. samuelis, Coffin (1960) states that
the smallest sexually mature females ne found during
the summer months had a carapace width of 1.8 mm. wnereas
Je encountered a number of gravid females meisuring only
1.5 mm across.
Summary
The larvae and yoing idults of Pagurus samuelis
(Stimpson, 1357), Pagurus hirsutiusculus (Dana, 1857),
Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859) and Pagurus
hemphillii (Benedict, 1851) were comparatively studied to
liscover characters by which these species could be readily
