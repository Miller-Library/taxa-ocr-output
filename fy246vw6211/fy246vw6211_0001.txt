Six species of Pagurus, P. samielis (Stimpson, 1357),
P. hirsutiusculus (Dana, 1857), P. granosimands (Stimpson,
1859), P. hemphillii (Benedict, 1392), P. ochotensis (Benedict,
1851) ani P. beringanus (Benedict, 1392) occur ilong the
suores by the Hopkins Marine Station, Facific Grove, California.
The first four are found in the intertidil with more or
less overlap ing distributions. Although excellent keys
exist, notibly that of Schmitt (1921), for distinguishing
anong the adults, little information is availible on the
larvae and juveniles of thase species. Throuch the vork
of Thompson (1903), Hays (1939), and Goffin (1950), the
larvae and immature adults of P. samuelis can be identified;
However the larvae and juveniles of the other soocies ire
not recognizable on the basis of published accounts. For
the present work an ittempt has been made to determine means
for identifving the larvae of the first five aforementioned
species ind the voung adults of the first four.
