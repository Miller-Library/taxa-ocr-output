morphological characteristics ire alse prominent enough
to be of value for rapid identification. Exam'nation of
the one available specimen of third zoea P. ochotensis
indicated that there may be more spines on the uropods
of this species tnan on those of the intertidal species.
Spines on the uropods of P. granosimanus ind P. hemchillii
re all approximately the same, while in P. samuelis and
P. hirsutiusculus the most proximal spine is much smaller
or is often missing, apparently as a result of breakage.
where high magnification (400X) is available, the
number of prominent spines on the exopodite of the second
antennu provides a definite morphological characteristic
helpful in partially separating the five species. The
eight antennal spines on P. ocnotensis are evenly
separited
seines
and readily distinguishable; however the most iist
of the other species are close together and usually are
not discernable except under higner magnification.
Glaucothoe stages of only P. hirsutiusculus ind
P. granosimanus were available for examination.
Extensive collection of the immature adults yielded
crabs of all the species except P. ocnotensis and
P. beringanis, ranging in size from those described in
Schmitt's key (1921) to tne following mininum crapace
widtus: P. samuelis-O.5mm, P. nirsutiusculis-O.6mn,
P. granosimanus-O.8mm, and P. hem hillii-1.1nw. By
cemparing overlapping characteristics, it was possiole
to assign inlividuals of even the smallest size to the
proper soecies. Their charactristics, as thev cainged
with increasing size, ire sown in Tables IX to XIII.
