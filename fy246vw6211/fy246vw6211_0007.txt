distinguished without the use of a high magnification
microscope. P. samuelis and P. hirsutiusculus, P
granosimanus and P. hemphillii, ind P. ochotensis could
easily be separated into the above groups but further
identification proved difficult in the young adults and
sogetimes impossible in the larvae. The following
dichotomous keys summarize the results.
KEY TO ZOEAL STAGES
A. ist antennae shorter than rostrum; 4 or 5 spines on
uropods of 3rd zoea and l spines on uropods of htn zoea;
8 spines on 2nd antennae; vellow "star" on sides of
carapace --- - - - - - -Pagurus ocnotensis
AA. Ist antennae approximately equal to rostrum in length;
3 spines on uropods of 3rd zoea, 3 or 4 on hth zoea; 5
or Ã© spines on 2nd antennae; no vellow "star" on sides
of carapace
B. Red spot or general redlish nue on the lateral fices and
distal ends of the protopodites of the ist ind 2nd
maxillipeds; small red spot or no red spot on proximil
end of protopodites of 3rd maxillipeds; red on anterior
faces of eye stalks and on sides of curapace; 5 spines on
2nd antennae; 2 large and i small spine on uropods of
3rd and hth zoea; generally "V" shaped notch in telson
of ist zoea
C. No vellow on inside of proximal ends of ist and 2nd
maxillipeds; small red spot usually not appearing
until 3rd zoea - - - - - - Pagurus samielis
CC.Yellow on inside of proximal ends of ist ind 2nd
mixillipeds of ist and often 2nd zoea, rarely seen on
