The smallest gravid females found had carapace vidths of
1.5mm for P. samuelis and 1.2 mm for P. hirsutiusculis.
The same color patterns exhipited by these females were
found in crabs ranging down to carapace widths of 1.2nm
for P. samuelis and 1.0 mm for P. nirsitiusculus. Egg-
bearing specimens of P. granosimands ind P. hemphillii
were not found in sufficient numbers for any minimum size
at sexual maturity to be determined.
One morphological feature of the post-larval inlividuals
worthy of mention is the shape of the rostrum. In linge
specimens of P. granosimanus, the median projection o" the
frent of the carapace is proadly rounded, short and very
blunt, in accordance with Schmitt's key (1921). In
specimens of P. grinosimanus hiving a carapace width of
about 2.5mm or less and in the other three species in ill
post-larval stages, the rostrum is rather sharply pointed.
Discussion
In both the larval and post-larval specimens, axamination
revealed jefinite similarities between P. samelis ind
P. hirsutiusculus and between P. granosimanus anl P. hemohillii.
In the larvae, P. ochotensis formed a third group. Individuals
could pe assigned relatively easily to one group or inother
by the use of pigmentation and morphology; however, it wis
frequently exceedingly difficult and oc asionally impossible
to determine the species of an inlividual vithin one of these
species pairs. The tables are so designed is to emplisize
these sigilarities.
