water temperature maintained at approximately 13Â° C. Once
a day the water was changed, after which the lurrae were
fed Artemia nauplii.
Whenever possible, characteristics cnosen for larval
identification were those which could oe observed with a
dissecting microscope, although a compound microscope was
occasionally necessary. Gross morphology was found to be
similar for all species; for this reason the following key
emphasizes differences in pigmentation.
No characteristics of the glaucothoe were found to be
sufficiently prominent for rapid identification; therefore
a more detailed study was undertaken, examining the structure
of the telson, uropods, and pleopods under 400X magnification.
In all cases, the specimens were lignted from above
rather than from below because the pigmentation was not
always visible in transmitted light. Both living and
preserved larvae were studied, but, in order to prevent
errors from shrinkage and movement, all measurements were
made immediately after the larvae had been killed in
magnesium chloride, chloral hydrate, or a combination of
both. The larvae were measured dorsally from the most
anterior part of the head in the midline immediately below
the rostrum to the central notch on the posterior edge of
the telson. Measurements were tiken at each larval instir
available daring the study.
Time lid not permit raising the species pist metamorphosis.
For this reason the species characteristics of juveniles and
small adults were determined by starting with adult specimens
lirge enough to be clearly identified by Schmitt's key (1921)
