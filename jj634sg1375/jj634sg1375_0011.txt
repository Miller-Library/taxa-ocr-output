consistent with the osmotic stress hypothesis. Also
the work of Frank (1965) concerning seasonal upward
shifts in C. digitalis populations fits well with the
immersion effects on tenacity.
This study provides another view of the habitat
selection of C. digitalis. The initial study of Haven
(1971) described niche separation of C. digitalis and
C. scabra where C. digitalis had less resistance to
dessication but better competitive ability, thus
leading to its occupancy of vertical faces. Wolcott
(1973) rated them equivalent in dessication resistance
but indicated that dessication stress determined the
upper limit to residency. This does present a real
enigma for intertidal ecologists because it is the only
case where exposure to ambient sea water represents an
osmotic stress to a marine invertebrate. It is also
one of the few instances in which a physiological
stress is regulating the lower limits of distribution
of the adult population.
