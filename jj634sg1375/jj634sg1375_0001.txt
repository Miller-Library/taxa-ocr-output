ABSTRACT
The high intertidal limpet, Collisella digitalis,
was kept continuously washed by sea water and compared
with adjacent individuals under ambient conditions to
determine whether prolonged submersion constituted a
stress. The osmolarity of extracorporeal water and
body fluid were monitored over four days, along with
the force required to remove the limpets from the rock.
The tenacity dropped markedly after nine hours of
submersion and by four days was less than 503 of
control animals. Increased tenacity was correlated
with elevated osmolarity of body fluid. It is
suggested that C. digitalis behaviorally regulates its
body fluid at elevated levels and that prolonged
submersion may constitute a physiological stress and
set a lower boundary for adults of the species.
