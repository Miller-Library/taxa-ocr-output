Area of the foot was calculated from the length, using
the regression equation (Hahn and Denny)
2.24
y - 3200 x
where x is the length of the limpet in centimeters and
y is the area of the foot in square meters.
Extracorporeal fluid was obtained from each limpet
by gently pressing the foot and pipeting the expressed
fluid. The osmolarity (mOsm) was assayed with a Preci-
sion Systems microsmometer utilizing freezing point
depression. This required a 50-microliter sample size.
Body fluid was collected from each sample group by an
incision through the sole of the foot and extracting
the fluid with a microhematocrit capillary tube.
Samples had to be pooled to get a sufficient volume to
measure osmolarity as above.
A fourth experiment tested the survival of limpets
transplanted lower in the intertidal. Two groups of
thirty limpets were transplanted from their home sites
to lower levels in the intertidal, chosen so limpets
could not move to higher levels. One group was transÂ¬
planted to a region that was submerged in three of the
four tide changes and not exposed to intense wave
