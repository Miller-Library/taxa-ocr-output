Figure Four shows the data from the effects of
transplanting experimental limpets to regions lower in
the intertidal. Compared with the control group, there
is significantly less survival in the exposed and non-
exposed limpets, with the exposed limpets losing 573 of
the original population and the non-exposed 47% of the
original number. In the control group, only one limpet
was lost during the seven-day period.
Discussion
In almost all cases, the experimental limpet
showed significantly lower osmolarities of extra-
corporeal fluid. Only during the three-hour period in
experiment one was this different statistically insig-
nificant and during this period, both control and
experimental limpets were getting heavily washed by
high surf. Correlating with the reduced osmolarities.
the tenacityies of the experimental limpets were all
lower than the controls with only four out of nineteen
determinations not statistically significant. In
experiment one the three- and twenty-five-hour samples
