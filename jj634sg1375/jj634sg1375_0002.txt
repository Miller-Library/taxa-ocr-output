Introduction
The limpet Collisella digitalis inhabits vertical
rock faces and crevices high in the intertidal zone.
Although C. digitalis are frequently splashed during
high tide, they are rarely submerged and have the
highest intertidal distribution of central California
limpets. Breen (1972) showed that C. digitalis
exhibited upward migratory movement during the fall and
winter months coinciding with periods of heavy surf.
Observations in aquaria show that C. digitalis quickly
moves above the water line. The fact that C. digitalis
flee from sea water for respiratory reasons seems
unlikely because of studies done by Baldwin (1968)
which show high oxygen consumption during periods of
submergence.
Inspection of intertidal sites reveals many
potential sites lower in the intertidal area where they
would not seem to be excluded by competition. To
determine if C. digitalis is osmotically stressed by
sustained exposure to sea water is the subject of this

tenacity on the substrate and this is correlated with
osmolarity of extracorporeal fluid and body fluid.
