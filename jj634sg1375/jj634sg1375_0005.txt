action. A second group was moved to an exposed site
with very high wave action. A third group served as
controls and were moved to a different site but at the
same intertidal level they normally inhabit. Numbers
surviving were counted each day for 7 days.
Results
Figure One shows the data from the first of three
submergence experiments.
The control sample at time
zero was obtained during unusually high surf conditions
consistently wetting both control and experimental
limpets. Three hours after submergence, there was no
significant difference between tenacities and extra¬
corporeal fluid osmolarities among control and experi¬
mental limpets. There was a decrease in body fluid
osmolarity in the control groups between zero and three
hours coinciding with periods of heavy surf. The tena-
cities and extracorporeal fluid osmolarities in the
six- and nine-hour limpets were significantly differ-
ent, with p-values of less than 0.005 for random
sampling error. Twenty-nine hours after submergence,
the extracorporeal fluid osmolarity of the control
