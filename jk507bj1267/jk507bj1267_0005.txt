with the data in Figure 2 shows that A. scutum moves an aveyage

is 5.5 inches.

Movements In Relation to Tide and Light
In an attempt to find a relationship between tide, light,
and the movements of Acmaea scutum the total houly movement and
the vertical vector of the hourly movement were compared at
ferent phases of the tide and under different light conditions.
â€”
The total hourly movement is the distance between the posicions
occupied by a limpet before and after a one hour interval. The
vertical vector of the hourly movement is the vertical separationn
of the limpet's positions before and after a one hour interval. The
elation of total and vertical movement to light and tide is
represented in Figure 3 for the two observation areas. The A. scutu
represented in Figure3, A, were uncovered by the tide only once
during the twenty-four hour watch. The A. scutum represented in
igure 3, B, were uncovered twice during the twenty-four hour watch.
Figure 3 shows that Acmaea scutum moves most when it is awash.
Each peak on the graphs showing total movement corresponds to a
period when the animals werenawash. A. scutum does not move when

out of the water and in sunlight, but the animal may move a

completely submerged A. scutum moves sporadically, and the effects
