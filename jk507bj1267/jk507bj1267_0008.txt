Summary
1) The effects of light and tide on the movementsorithe
limpet, Acmaea scutum were studied in the field and in the laboratory.
2) A. scutum moves most when subject to the turbulence of the
g tidal ebb and flow, but continues to move when
idal wash u
submerged,at high water.
3) A. scutum moves upward with the incoming wash during tidal
flow and downward with the outgoing wash during tidal ebb.
4) The movements of A. scutum during periods of wash appear
to be dependent on the light conditions; vertical and total move-
nents are greater at night than du
ing the day.
5) In the Sield situation studied A. scutum moved an average
of 40 inches between two successive periods of lowerglow water,
but returned to within an average distance of 5.5 inches from the
starting point.
6) In the laboratory A. scutum moves upward when submerged;
the rate is slowest when antmals are illuminated from above, higher
under condition of darkness, and still higher when the animals are
Cangin
illuminated from below. These results generally set results
obtained in the field, and are interpreted in terms of a negative
geotaxis (stronger) and a negative phototaxis (weaker) in limpets
awash or submerged.
