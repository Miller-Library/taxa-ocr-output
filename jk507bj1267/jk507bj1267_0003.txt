positions of the marked limpets were indicated with reference to
the divisions on the horizontal line; vertical positions were
measured with a yard stick. Further painted lines on the rock
were avoided because it was felt they might ffect limpet movements.
On April 27 and 28, 1966, the positions of nineteen Acmaea
scutum were recorded avery hour or every two hours for a twenty-
four hour period. On May 3 and 4, 1966, the positions of eleven
other A. scutum were recorded hourly for a twenty-four hour period.
The light conditions and the level of the tide were recorded with
each observation. At each observation it was noted whether the
limpets were submerged by the sea, awash, or exposed to the air.

were underwater about sixteen hours a day. A wet suit, snorkel,
mask, and underwater light were used to observe the limpets when
submerged. During the period of higher high water on both days
the heavy surf conditions made observations impossible.
