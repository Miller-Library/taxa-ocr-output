vigorously agitated. In each experiment 12 to 16 A. scutum were
placed on each side of the glass plate about one inch from the bo
bottom. Each experiment was run twice; a total of approximately
50 limpets were subjected to each combination of variables for a
period of two hours.
The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 4. The

variables most closely approximating thase in the field. In the
rial with light above the cylinder and calm water the fewest
npets reached the surface. This result corresponds well with
the field observation that Acmaea scutum move upward only a

ssance
a when they are awash on a resing tide during the day. Of
the first four experiments, the greatest number oflimpets reached
the surface under conditions of darkness and turbulence. This result
rrelates well with the field observation that A. scutum move
co
upward most rapidly when they are awash on a rising tide at night.
Preliminary studies showed that, when submerged, Acmaea scutum
exhibits a negative geotaxis, and moves upward. Ross (1966) found
ged A. scutum also exhibit a negative phogotaxis. In the
that subme.
st four experiments it appears that these two responses are
operating. When animals were submerged in the light, the negative
responses to light and gravity opposed each other, and only 40% of
the limpets reached the surface in the two hour period. To test this
interpretation the light was placed beneath the cylinder in the last
two experiments. Under these circumstances the negative taxes to
gravity and light reinforced one another and more than 80% on the
limpets moved to the su?
a in the two hour period.
