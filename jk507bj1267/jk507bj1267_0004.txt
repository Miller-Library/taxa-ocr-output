had indicated that A. scutum moves very little when out of water.
For this reason the intervals between successive observations were
greater when the animals were out of the water. Figure I shows
the trails of two A. scutum as plotted from positions recorded
every hour or every two hours. In Table 1 I have tried to show
the percentage error in my tracking method. Without contindaas
observations one cannot be certain of the exact path the limpet
followed to reach the new point. Table 1 shows that there is an
apparent decrease of 15% in the trail length if one records
positions every two hours rather than once every hour. Even with
hourly readings the distances represented by the recorded tracks
are probably less than the actual distances moved, but the limpets
move so slowly that the error is probably small. The trails of
the two limpets shown in Figure 1 are characteristic of the trails
of all the marked A. scutum. The trails demonstrate that individuals
cross one anothers tracks during periods of activity. Figure 2
shows that between successive periods of lower low water A. scutur
moves an average of 40 inches with extremes of 16 and 76 inches.
While plotting the trails of the twenty-four limpets it was
noticed that at low tide they returned to the vicinity of the spot
they had occupied the previous low tide. The average net displaceÂ¬
ment of the twenty-four limpets from one low tide to the next was
ang one o
5.5 inches. The largest net displacement for the twenty-four limpets
axaca
was 14 inches. Only one of the twenty-four returned to the samer
et spot it had occupied the previous low tide, and here it
assumed its original orientation. Subsequent observations at
