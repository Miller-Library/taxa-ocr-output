The limpet, Acmaea scutum Eschscholtz, 1833, inhabits the
midtide zone on rocky shores along the California coast. Test
(1945) has noted some aspects of the ecology of this species, but
detailed information is lacking on its activity pattern. The
present study was undertaken to determine the movements of the
Acmaea scutum population and the effects of tide and light on
these movements.
Field Study
Methods and Materials
Except where noted, all studies were carried out on the
rocky shores of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. Two
vertical rock surfaces, located on the leeward side of Mussel
Point were chosen for the first set of field studies. Both
surfaces faced west and both were exposed to considerable surf.
To facilitate the measurement of limpet movement, narrow horizontal
lines were painted on botherock surfaces approximately one foot
above the highest A. scutum. One inch divisions were marked along
this line. The A. scutum were individually marked by dots of paine
on their shells. Marking was done at low tide on a warm day, and
the animals were not removed from the rock. The horizontal
