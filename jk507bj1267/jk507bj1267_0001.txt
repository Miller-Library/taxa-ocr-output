ROGERS, DON A. (Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
Calif., USA.) The effects of light and tide on movements of the
limpet Acmaea scutum (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) The Veliger
--Acmaea scutum moves most when subject
to the turbulence of the tidal wash during tidal ebb and flow, but
continues to move when submerged at high water. A. scutum moves
upward with the incoming wash during tidat flow and downward with
the outgoing wash during tidal ebb. The movements of A. scutum
during periods of wash appear to be dependent on the light conditions;
vertical and total movements are greater at night than during the
day. In the laboratory A. scutum moves upward when submerged; the
rate is slowest when animals are illuminated from above, higher
under conditions of darkness, and still higher whenrthenanimais are
balou
illuminated from as.
