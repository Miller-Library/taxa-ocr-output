Figure 1. Trails of two Acmaea scutum on a vertical rock surface
during periods of awash and submersion from 1500, April 27, 1966.
to 0900, April 28, 1966. Each point represents the position of
the limpet at the time of observation.
Figure 2. Total distance moved by twenty-four Acmaea scutum on a
vertical rock surface during a 24 hour period.
Figure 3. Comparison of light and tide conditions with total movement
the
and,vertical component of total movement. Figure33 A refers to data
collected April 27-28, 1966, from the movements of sixteen limpets.
Figure 3 B refers to data collected May 3-4, 1966, from the movements
of eight limpets. Time is represented on the horizontal axes of
both graphs. The vertical axes of the upper graphs, showing total
hourly movement, represents the total distance moved during the
hour for all of the limpets. The veticallaxes of the lower graphs,
tho
showing vertical component of movement, represent the upward or
downward displacement each hour of all the limpets from the position
they had occupied at the beginning of the hour period.
Figure 4. Results of labokatory experiments. Each experiment lasted
two hours. The top graph shows the percentage of limpets that were
at the surface after the two hour period. The middle graph shows
the percentage oflimpets that were between the bottom of the glass
plate and the surface after the two hour period. The lower graph
shows the percentage of limpets that were still at the bottom of
the glass plate after the two hour period.
