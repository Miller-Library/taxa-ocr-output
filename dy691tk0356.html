INTRODUCTION
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula pulligo : Exact'>Tegula pulligo</span> is the commonest trochid gastropod found in the kelp
forests of Monterey County. Previous distributional studies on <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. pulligo,</span>
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. montereyi</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. brunnea</span> by Lowry and Pearse (1974), Hunt (1977) and
Sellers (1977) indicated that the three populations stratified on
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>Macrocystis</span> plants, with T. pulligo usually occupying the lower four meters
of the plant.
Preliminary subtidal observations in the kelp forest adjacent to the
Hopkins Marine Station at Mussel Point in mid-April yielded data suggesting
that T. pulligo underwent a diel vertical migration on the kelp, with up-
ward motion occurring at night. Subsequent field studies by Thornton
(reported in this volume) have shown there to be a statistically significant
migration of the population in our study area.
Laboratory studies were undertaken in attempt to 1) demonstrate the
observed field behavior in a laboratory environment and 2) to determine
what effect light, or its intensities, may have on any observed behavior.
If light was shown to be an important regulating factor, it was also hoped
to obtain a general light-preferred range and maximally tolerated intensity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All experiments were conducted using a clear acrylic cylinder measur¬
ing 2 m high and having an internal diameter of 14 cm. A single kelp plant,
usually having between eight and twelve stipes, and its holdfast, was
attached to a weighted plastic box and sunk in the cylinder. The box was
perforated and prevented animals from blocking water flow, and decreased
the directional nature of the flow by allowing multiple outlets or inlets,
depending on flow direction. Blades on each plant were trimmed as necessary
(2)
to allow viewing inside the cylinder. Animals collected at random from
the field were dropped in the cylinder and given between one and three
days to adjust to their new environment before observational periods began.
During several studies, natural light passing through a skylight above
the apparatus was the sole light source. In those studies which used
artificial lights, 8 75 watt GE reflector bulbs and 1 650 watt <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sylvania : Exact'>Sylvania</span>
DWV movie light were used. To allow additional flexibility in establishing
desired gradients, 4 of the 75W bulbs and the 650W bulb were controlled by
a Variac regulator, and varying thicknesses of window screening were
attached to the outside of the cylinder. All light intensities reported
were measured with a Weston Model 703-60 Type 3A photometer on the outside
of the cylinder. A red-cellophane-covered flashlight with a peak intensity
of 50 Foot-Candles was used to determine the position of the snails at
night. Fresh sea water (about 14°C) flowed continually throughout the
system. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analyses were done by
Student's T-test.
RESULT!
Figure 1 is a schematic presentation of the light intensities generally
encountered in the field. As the study progressed, the canopy thickened,
and ambient intensities decreased slightly.
Figure 2 presents the results from a study using natural daylight
and one day of acclimation. It shows a slight tendency for the animals
to move up in darkness, but statistical tests between the mean heights
during the dark interval and those of the lighted periods show no signifi¬
cance (p».9). Additional analysis between bright (200 ft.-candles) and
dimmer conditions heights did not show any significance to exist, either
(.5 «p «.9).
(3)
The animals represented by Figure 3 were allowed one day of acclima¬
tion and artificial light was used. There appears to be vertical movement
with peak height occurring in the brightest light interval. Testing be¬
tween the mean heights of the light versus dark periods showed a close to,
but not quite (p«.065) significant displacement of the animals with differ¬
ing light conditions. Further, no significance between dim and bright
conditions was demonstrated (.2 «p «.4).
In the experiment represented by Figure 4, the lighting was the same
same as Figure 3 but 4 days of acclimation was used. The population ex¬
hibited a clear migration upward corresponding with the dark interval.
The significance of the movement was dramatic (po.0001). Again, tests
were conducted between bright and dim mean heights, and they showed no
significant differences to exist (.2 «p«.4).
The data depicted on Figure 5 came from a study where dim artificial
light was used (a peak of 70 ft. candles) and one day was allowed for
acclimation. The mean height during the lighted intervals is rather
significantly lower (0.02 « p « 0.05) than the mean heights during the
dark condition.
Figure 6 presents the data from a displacement experiment. Animals
were removed, then dropped back into the cylinder in light. They were
given 6 hours of light followed by 9 hours of dark. One run showed a
highly significant (using 952 confidence intervals established by T-test)
increase in mean heights during the dark interval. The second run showed
a dramatic increase also, but it occurred during the lighted period. In
combining the two runs, however, no significant differences between dark
and light heights can be shown (.05 « p «.1).
(4)
Figure 7 depicts displacement studies during the night. In analyz¬
ing the first run, there was no significance evident between the light
and dark conditions. During the second run, however, highly significant
movement took place between the dark period of 1830-1000 and the following
lighted interval (p « .005), and motion significant to between .025 and
.Ol occurred during the dim period between 1700 and 1830.
DISCUSSION
As mentioned in the introduction, T. pulligo has been shown by field
observations to undergo a significant vertical migration up kelp plants
at night, with downward movement as daylight increases. Predation by
visually-cued animals known to prey on T. pulligo such as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Enhydra lutris : Exact'>Enhydra lutris,</span>
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Hexagrammacus decagrammus,</span> <span style='background-color:grey' title='Damalichthys vacca : Fuzzy'>Damalychthys vacca</span> and Octopus (Hunt, 1977)
could make such behavior selectively advantageous. During the day, though
some individuals may be found exposed on the blades and stipes, the bulk
of the population remains low on the plant, hidden from view, thereby
escaping detection by many predators. At night, a larger percentage of
the population moves up onto the stipes and blades feeding.
Such behavior, however, was not clearly and consistently seen in the
laboratory. With the notable exception of the population of animals used
for the Figure 5 experiment, those animals given one day or less to
acclimatize to the system showed no significant movement of mean height
with varying light intensities. Animals which had been in the system for
two days or more began to show movement bordering on significance (p «.05).
The animals allowed four days or more in the system before being observed
demonstrated a clear migration of population mean height as a function
of light intensities. Their peak height was attained during the dark
intervals, as was the peak of the field population. This would indicate
that the animals required a longer period of adjustment to the experimental
conditions than had been anticipated.
The data presented on Figure 5 also calls to attention the importance
of accurately determining the light intensities actually seen by the
animals, both in the field and within the apparatus. As seen in Figure 1,
the light experienced by the animals on the kelp appears to be in the 0-125
ft.-candles range. Only during the study presented by Figure 5 was the
light that dim; in the other studies, the light shown on the animals
tended to be higher for at least a part of the study. The longer period
of adjustment could be in response to those higher levels of light.
Determining the actual levels seen by the animals within the cylinder was
also difficult, since intensity varied as readings were taken around the
circumference. In future work, it might prove informative if distinctions
were made as to the location of an individual, i.e., behind a blade, in
the center of the cylinder, on an extreme wall. The variability of
responses within the laboratory system could be a reflection of not having
taken such considerations fully into account.
Individual variability was touched upon only superficially by tagging
and monitoring individual's positions, and could use more work. Samples
of the field population were haphazardly taken, and their treatment was
not standardized. Perhaps by controlling for such specific factors as
sex, size, time since last feeding, or collection site variability of
response might be reduced.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSTONS
1) T. pulligo undergoes a nocturnal migration in the laboratory similar
to that seen in field studies.
(6)
2) T. pulligo requires at least three days to acclimatize to a
laboratory environment in which light intensities are higher than those
experienced in the field.
3) Animals knocked off plants undergo their greatest repopulation move-
ment at night.

Animals were run simultaneously with those of Figure 3,
but had different history. Given one day initially to
adjust, the animals were used in a two day displacement
study, which involved being displaced four times during
the study. Thereafter, the animals were left undisturbed
in the same conditions as Figure 3 group. However, at
1600 on the first day of this study, the animals were
displaced in a move necessary to standard lighting seen
by both groups.
Light intensities were measured between the two
systems, and are in foot-candles. The dashed line is
the mean height curve for the entire population; the
solid line is the plot of mean height for those animals
above the top of the plastic supporting box. The top
figure shows distribution of the total population as
percentages per quarter cylinder intervals. The numbers
within the lowest intervals are the percentages of
the total population found below the top of the box.
