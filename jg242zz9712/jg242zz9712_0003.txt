rinsed with fresh seawater and placed in fresh seawater for one day. This
method resulted in a death rate of approximately 302 with the surviving
Tigriopus appearing normal, although some were lethargic. Only animals
exhibiting normal swimming behavior were used for the experiments.
A random population of 100 dyed Tigriopus was introduced about 10
hours before high tide into each of 11 separate tide pools all of which
received wash during high tide. All pools were along the coast line of
the Monterey Peninsula. Recapture took place no later than 10 hours
after the high tide, and was accomplished by draining the tide pools
through plankton netting, refilling the pools and draining them again to
extract animals missed the first time. The refilled pools were allowed
to sit about one hour before the second draining. The number of animals
obtained from the second draining was less than half of those extracted
during the initial effort.
RESULTS (MARK AND RECAPTURE)
The mean number of animals recovered from the 11 pools was 10.4,
or 10.42 of the introduced population. (S,= 1.96, range= 0-20). Several
experiments done following the release study showed dyed T. californicus
to be less fit than undyed animals.
When equal numbers of dyed and undyed Tigriopus were put into the
lowest of a series of three artificial tide pools (Fig. 1) with a flow
rate of 40 ml. per minute for 24 hours, 168 undyed T. californicus reached
the upper pool and only 3 dyed animals. Alternately 750 dyed and undyed
individuals were placed in the upper tide pool of Figure 1. Animals were
