INTRODUCTION
Tigriopus californicus (Harpacticoid, Copepoda) is the predominant
inhabitant of the tide pools in the high intertidal zone from Alaska to
Baja, California. The vertical range of Tigriopus extends from tide pools
receiving occasional splash to those inundated by the majority of high
tides. Studies on population stability of Tigriopus in varied locations
are virtually nonexistant. Igarshi (1959) mentioned periodic fluctuations
of Tigriopus japonicus population size in accordance with the tidal
periodicity, but with little quantitative evidence. Vittor (1971) workÂ¬
ing with T. californicus stated that colonization of pools is probably
accomplished via inshore current transport of animals swept from pools
which are essentially permanently populated. But, again, he presents no
data to support his suggestions. There is no literature describing the
reactions of T. californicus to turbulence or their behavior during
periods of wave shock in the tide pools.
This project was undertaken to determine the effects of turbulence,
in the form of wave action, on T. californicus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS (MARK AND RECAPTURE)
Random populations of T. californicus were collected from tide pools
known to be washed during high tide. These animals were marked using a
neutral red solution in the following manner. A saturated solution of
neutral red in 100 ml. of seawater was prepared. 30 ml. of this saturated
solution was added to 70 ml. of fresh seawater containing the Tigriopus.
The animals were kept in this container for 4 to 6 hours and were then
