column within two seconds of the turbulence. The number in the bottom
third rose and then fell as if the animals were simply passing through
it to leave the water column. No animals were located in the top third
during the darkness experiment so this decrease was not seen.
SUMMARY
Tigriopus do not have an endogenous rhythm synchronous with the
tidal cycle which regulates the time when they leave the water column.
Their survival behavior to wave action is keyed by the actual turbulence
and involves a positive geotaxis.
