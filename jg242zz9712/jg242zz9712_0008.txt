in the water column. The data points fall as random fluctuations about a
mean. The May 26 experiment, however, clearly points out a drastic reduction
of animals in the water column during wave wash. This indicates that
turbulence, or wave action itself, is necessary to stimulate the Tigriopus
to leave the water column. The May 26 study shows where the Tigriopus
are not located, but does not tell one where they moved. The results of
the multi-substrate test, though, offers evidence of where the Tigriopus
are located. Although no animals were seen or retrieved from the water
column, 60 were collected from the back crevice. This is almost ten times
more animals than were collected by three separate samples during calm
periods. This suggests that the onset of waves signals the Tigriopus
to accumulate in the crevice to avoid being washed out of the pool.
The question which now arises is what component of the turbulence
response leads them to that, or any other crevice. Tom Glaser (personal
communication) noted a strong negative phototaxis in response to turbulence.
Figure 8, though, shows that animals lit from below dive in response to
turbulence, in fact the greatest decrese in animals in the water column
with the onset of turbulence is noted with those lit from below. This
suggests a positive geotaxis being produced by the turbulence. With no
light cues (Fig. 9) the animals were again seen to dive, and remove themÂ¬
selves from the water column. This is more evidence toward a positive
geotaxis being produced by turbulence. The study with the animals from
the high pool (Fig. 8) shows that animals that are very rarely subject
to wave action still show the above mentioned turbulence responses. All
animals run in light were also seen to leave the upper third of the water
