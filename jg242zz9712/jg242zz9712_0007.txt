T. californicus have some mechanism enabling them to remain in tide pools
subjected to extreme wave action. This mechanism involves leaving the
water column and relocating in a crack or crevice while the wave is
washing the tide pool. The onset of such behavior could be produced by
one of two things. The first is that T. californicus posses an endogenous
rhythm which is in synchrony with the tidal rhythm. This rhythm would
dictate the percentage of time a given individual spends in the water
column. This percentage would drop drastically concurrent with the onset
of high tide. Thus, during any period of high tide few animals would be
located in the water column and many more clinging in small cracks or
crevices. The second hypothesis is that the mechanism is triggered by
a wave entering the tide pool. This assumes that the immediate reaction
to turbulence is for the animal to leave the water column and thus heighten
its chances of survival. The number of animals located on the artificial
substrates is taken to be a constant fraction of the total number of
animals in the water column at any given time. This assumes that there
are two separate places a Tigriopus may be located: 1) in the water column,
including the substrate or 2) not in the water column, clinging in small
crevices. The single substrate experiment shows no significant decrease
in the number of Tigriopus in the water column during high tides. This
random distribution during two periods of high tide, but no wave wash,
argues against any sort of endogenous rhythm governing the animals behavior.
The results of the differential substrate tests again argue against any
endogenous rhythm synchronous with tidal activity. The study conducted
during a period of high tide only, shows no marked decrease of animals
