allowed to equilibrate for one hour before equal quantities of water
(approximately 5 liters) were poured into the pool. 195 undyed Tigriopus
remained in the pool following this "wave" while only 70 dyed animals
remained. These results indicate that the percentage of undyed T. californicus
not washed away from tide pools affected by high tides is somewhat greater
than the 10.4 per cent of dyed animals calculated from my study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS (FIELD STUDIES)
Three separate types of field studies were conducted. One set of
experiments involved the use of a single type of artificial substrate
placed in the bottom of a tide pool. This substrate was a sand-rock
mixture glued to a 48 x 8.5 mm disposable petri dish. Experiments were
run over a ten hour period including the high tide. Exchange of subÂ¬
strates was done every hour. Only one petri dish was present at any time.
Although the experiments were run through a high tide, no waves washed
the tide pool. The other field studies involved the use of five different
artificial substrates, also in disposable petri dishes. These substrates
included loose sand, shells, organic material, clay, small rocks and a
plain petri dish. Again, these experiments were conducted over a ten
hour period including the high tide. Every hour six new substrates were
placed in the pool and the previous set was capped and removed. During
the May 24 run no waves washed the tide pool, whereas approximately 3 hours
of wave wash occurred during the May 26 run. The third field experiment
involved the use of many identical small rock substrates simultaneously
placed in the tide pool prior to the first wave wash of the high tide.
