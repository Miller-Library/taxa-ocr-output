Several of these substrates were replaced during calm periods between
the subsequent three waves. The latter two field studies were carried
out in the tide pool shown in Figure 2, located 400 meters south of
Point Joe. In all cases the individual substrates were examined under
a dissecting microscope to determine the number of animals present.
RESULTS (FIELD STUDIES)
Results of the single substrate experiment are presented in Figure 3.
Results of the differential substrate experiment are presented in Figure 4.
No Tigriopus were found on any of the substrates of the multi-substrate
test. A 50 ml. sample taken from a crevice in the back of the pool,
however, yielded 60 animals. This sample was taken following a wave which
washed the tide pool. No Tigriopus were visible in the water column at
that time. Three separate samples from the same crevice during calm
periods much after high tides yielded only 3, 4 and 7 individuals.
MATERLALS AND METHODS (LAB STUDIES)
Laboratory turbulence studies were conducted using a rectangular
plexiglass container with glass beads as a substrate. The inside dimÂ¬
ensions of the container were 14 x 10 x 2 cm. Approximately 100 randomly
selected Tigriopus from tide pools receiving wave wash were used for the
first three studies. Tigriopus used in the fourth experiment were
collected from a tide pool at about the 25 foot level at Pescadero Point.
Three different lighting conditions were employed: 1) two microscope
lights below the container, 2) two microscope lights above the container,
and 3) constant darkness. The light intensity produced by the two
