microscope lights was 1,600 lux. The animals were placed in the pelxiglass
container and allowed to acclimate for 40 minutes at one of the three
lightings. Turbulence was introduced in the form of 30 ml. of fresh
seawater being poured into the container from a constant height. PhotoÂ¬
graphs were taken of the animals' reaction to this turbulence using a
Nikon F-28 with the motor drive attachment. Photographs in the light
experiments were shot at 2 frames per second. The constant darkness
pictures were shot at one frame per second with lighting from a Vivitar 292
strobe.
RESULTS (LAB STUDIES)
Results of turbulence on Tigriopus lit from above are shown in
Figure 5. The lower graph shows the total number of animals found in the
water column at the indicated times. The upper graph shows the vertical
distribution of the Tigriopus in the water column delineated by the per
cent of animals located in either the upper, middle, or lowest third.
The solid line indicates the percent of animals located in the lowest
third. The dashed line indicates the number of animals in the lowest
two thirds of the water column. Results of turbulence on Tigriopus
illumninated from below are shown in Figure 6, using the same format
employed in Figure 5. Figure 7 shows the results of turbulence on animals
in darkness. Results of turbulence on animals collected from the high
pool at Pescadero Point are shown in Figure 8.
DISCUSSION
The results of the mark and recapture studies indicate that
