INTRODUCTION
Factors influencing the mortality of individual isolated
organisms are often relatively simple to illucidate compared
to those determining the mortality of a population of interacting
individuals. Calhoun (1957, 1962a, 1962b) has amply pointed out
the fact that the elements of interaction are not simple but
highly complex. Physical as well as psyckological room is often
demanded. The complexities of interactions, behaviors, and
dominance hierarchies compound the factors at interplay in
social animals.
Through investigationof some of the latter mentioned factors,
the study of the factors influencing mortality in laboratory
populations became attractive. Preliminary observations made on
populations kept for behavioral studies suggested that the factors
of space, availability of shells or food, time, and behavioral
interactions might be involved in influencing the rate of mortal-
ity in these populations. Behavioral factors, considered in
another paper completed during the same period of observation,
will not be here considered.
A. AVAILABILITY OF SPACE
Methods.and results.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aquaria : Exact'>Aquaria</span> measuring Lx 2t cm. in total floor area were util
ized. Movable partitions of wood covered with polyethylene to
prevent climbing of the wood by the crabs allowed variance in
the floor area. Both running sea water and constant aeration
were employed. Crabs collected from the intertidal zones off
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, and Point Pinos,
Pacific Grove, were sorted into size classes by measurement
laterally across the cephalothorax. Preliminary experiments
involving 100 crabs of a size class 2.0 cm plus or minus 0.1 cm.
in aquaria L4 x 2to cm. were set up. Considerable aggressive
behavior is shown by the animals during the first 1-6 hours of
interaction. Subsequently the crabs tend to pile up in the corners
of the aquaria, and in no way do thegutilize the whole of the
space available to them. A partition iin the aquarium was employed
to vary the area. These preliminary experiments indicated that an
area 20 x 20 cm. in total floor area could support a maximum of
25 crabs for a minimum of 5 days with no greater than 204
mortality (see experiment D.). This space, arbitrarily designated
as 1004 area, was taken as a base for further experiments.
In experiments involving 25 crabs this 1006 area was increased,
and decreased in a reciprocal experiment, while the ratio of crabs
to shells, total number of individuals, and the absence of food
were constant. Tank adapted individuals of five days were added
to restore the tot al number when mortalities occurred. Fluctuations
of 20% of the 100% area were made in the two reciprocal experimemts
at 24 hour intervals. The maximum area available to population A
was 180% of the 100% 20 x 20 cm. area. The minimum available to
population B was 20% of the 100% area. Results are shown in Fig. 1
and table 1.
Conclusions.
Limitations of space appear to induce high mortality when
available area falls below 50% of the 100% pre-established area.
When the ratio of crabs to area approaches this 50% value, inter-
actions increase. Death is usually by murder of one individual
by another of larger size: an individual is approached by another,
extracted from its shell, and severed in two between cephalothorax
and abdomin. To buffer interactions imposed by this high ratio
of crabs to space, double this minimum 50%, or the originally
established "minimum" of 100% area (20 x 20 cm/ 25 crabs) will
be used as the area for further experiments.
B. AVAILABILITY OF SHELLS
Methods and results.
Aquaria measuring l x 26 cm. were divided into two areas
as described above with polyethylene covered partitions. Crabs
were sorted into a size class of 1.5 plus or minus 0.1 cm. as
before, and <span style='background-color:grey' title='Tegula funebralis : Fuzzy'>Tagula funebralis</span> shells which had been occupied by
crabs in the field were cleared of their owners and sorted into
a size class of 2.0 plus or minus O.1 cm. measuring the shell
at its greatest diameter. Two experiments were completed. In the
220
first experiment the initial ratio of crabs to shells was set
at 1:2 . Twelve shelled individuals were placed with 12 additional
empty shells in the 100% area. At 21 hour intervals mortalities
were countedand new tank-adapted individuals were added for those
lost. Area was kept constant, as was the ratio of crabs to shells.
At each of these intervals 50% of the unoccupied shells were
removed. The results are shown in Figure 2.
In the second experiment 25 housed animals were allowed to
remain undisturbed in a 100% area for five days. At the end of
this time interval no mortalities were recorded for this group.
At succeeding 24 hour intervals 10% of the crabs were removed
from their shells and returned to the tank. Mortalities were
measured over the ten day period of the experiment. Area and
the number of individuals remained constant as above. Results
are shown in Fig. 3.
Conclusions.
Within this defined population mortalities do not greatly
increase until the ratio of crabs to shells falls below 2:1.
It is difficult to infer that this ratio might become an effective
cause of death in natural populations in that Belknap (personal
communication, Hopkins spring group) found a ratio of crabs to
habtah
Ashells of 1:l among intertidal and subtidal Pagurus. It is
possible, however, that such field conditions might arise to
make this ratio a factor in mortality. Such a feld ratio does
sggest consdevable cempettion amon crabs for
walable shels: each te a evab obaes
shells, the pvolaloitty is hich that he wil

C. AVAILABILITY OF FOOD
Methods and results.
Welsh reports in Watermann (1961) that some decapod crus-
tacea lave been starved for periods exceeding two months. Sixty
five isolated individuals were kept in 50ml. beakers placed in
aquaria with aeriation and running sea water for 30 days. See Fig. 1.
Results and conclusions.
During the 30 day period no more than 5 individuals represent-
ing a mortality of 7.6% died. In the initial 15 day period of
starvation no individuals were lost. As the experiments involving
area, shells and food ran for no longer than two weeks, starvation
appears to be a negligible factor influencing mortality rates in
these studies.
D. TIME AS A FA CTOR
Methods and results.
Two experiments were performed: in the first the individuals
were isolated as in the above experiment. Twenty - five individuals
were used. Within this group there was a loss of one individual
in fourteen days for a mortality of 1%. See Fig. 5. In the second
experiment twenty - five individuals were placed in the 100%
area and allowed to remain for fourteen days. After five days
five individuals had been lost for a mortality of 20%, but after
this time there were no further losses for the remainder of the
fourteen days.

Conclusions.
This experiment, as does experiment C, serves mainly as a
control on some of the variables present in A and B. It is here
shown that the defined times here used are not factors of
excessive mortality in these h boratory populations.
E. GENERAL CONCLUSTONS
Singular behavioral patterns and those of interacting individ-
uals were not considered in this study. Some of the aspects of
dominance are considered in papers by Reese (1962) and in ar
companion paper by the author. Behavioral factors are undoubtedly
one of the principle factors of mortality in lab as well as in
natural populations. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus samuelis : Exact'>Pagurus samuelis</span> is highly aggressive, and
one is tempted to suggest from casual observations that murder
is one of the chief operative mechanisms of population control.
Even this is only the manifestation of behavior preceeding it.
To attempt to illucidate some of the factors which may elicit
such behavior has been the object of this study.
SUMNA RY
Factors influencing the mortality rates in laboratory
populations of Pagurus samuelis Stimpson were examined. Among
factors shown to be important are those involving space, avail-
ability of shells, and behavioral interactions. Factors negligible
to the mortality rates of these studies were starvation and time.
