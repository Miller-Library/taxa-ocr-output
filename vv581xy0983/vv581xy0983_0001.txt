Abstract
The thermal tolerance ranges of fish and the temperatures at which a fish performs
optimally are established by the evolutionary history and recent thermal exposure of the
organism. Some species of fish are highly eurythermal; they tolerate a wide range of
temperatures and, typically, exhibit a significant capacity to alter thermal tolerance limits and
thermal optima for physiological function as a result of acclimation. An excellent example of a
eurythermal fish is the goby Gillichthys mirabilis, commonly known as the long-jaw mudsucker,
which is found in waters whose temperatures range between approximately 9°C and 40°C. In
this experiment, I used G. mirabilis acclimated for four weeks to four different temperatures (98
14°, 19° and 26°C) to study the effects of acute decreases in ambient temperature on heart rate, a
physiological trait known to be important in setting thermal tolerance limits and metabolic
capacity. The average heart rate (n-3) of each acclimation group was plotted against the acute
change in temperature to examine the pattern by which heart rate decreased with decreasing
temperature. The respective heart rates are compared at shared temperatures to identify the
ability of the fish to meet the aerobic demand posed at each temperature. Heart rate decreased
with temperature at a constant rate in the fish acclimated at 9°C and 14°C. The heart rate of the
fish acclimated at 19°C and 26°C decreased at a constant rate until reaching 20 beats per minute,
which occurred at temperatures near 9°C for the 19°C fish and 15°C for the 26°C fish. A 20 beat
per minute heart rate was maintained until the temperature dropped below 5°C, at which point
the heart rate declined exponentially. At 1°C the 9° and 14°C acclimated fish maintain a heart
rate of over twice that of the 19° and 26°C acclimated fish, suggesting that temperature
acclimation shifts the thermal window of animals. This experiment could be used in conjunction
