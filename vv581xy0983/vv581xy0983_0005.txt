I hypothesized that thermal acclimation would have significant effects on heart rate and
the ability to sustain cardiac function at decreasing temperatures. More specifically, I predicted
that the fish acclimated at 26°C would have the most difficulty sustaining an aerobic metabolism
at low temperatures and that the 9°C acclimated fish will have the least difficulty
Materials and Methods
Animals
Gillichthys mirabilis were obtained from a lagoon on the University of California, Santa
Barbara campus. Prior to the experiment, the fish were acclimated to 9°C, 19°C, 26°C or ambient
seawater (-14°C) for one month in temperature controlled tanks. The tanks were equipped with
continuous water flow and filtration and the fish were fed pellet food once daily.
Pre-Operation
Three fish from a single acclimation group were tested at a time. Fresh seawater was put
into an experimental tank containing a chiller, heater, thermometer and continuous flow pump to
circulate the water. The seawater was heated or cooled to reach the respective temperature. To
anesthetize the fish prior to the heart monitor insertion, each goby was placed in a bucket and
covered with ice. The 26°C fish were anesthetized on ice for 5 minutes, the 19°C for 20 minutes.
the seawater specimens for 30 minutes and the 9°C for 45 minutes. These times were based on
empirical evidence and represent the minimal time needed to immobilize the fish long enough to
insert the electrodes. To make the electrode wires, Teflon coated stainless steel wires were cut
into three-foot segments. The ends were striped and one end was threaded through a small
surgical needle. The top 2mm of wire were bent into a hook over the needle that was used to
insert the electrode (see "Operation").
