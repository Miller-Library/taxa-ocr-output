minute interval were recorded as well and this average was used as the internal temperature of
the fish at the time of measurement of cardiac activity.
Results
Contraction of the pericardial cavity was amplified and converted into a P-wave and
ORS-complex to represent the depolarization of the atrium and contraction of the ventricle (Fig
1). The average heart rate from each acclimated temperature (n-3) was plotted against water
temperature (= fish body temperature) to determine how cardiac activity responded to acute
decreases in temperature (Fig 2). The heart rate of the 19°C and 26°C acclimated fish decreased
steadily with temperature until it fell to approximately 20 beats per minute, at which point the
heart rate remained stable. The plateau began near 15°C for 26°C fish and 9°C for the 19°C
specimens. Subsequently, heart rate fell significantly as temperature decreased below 5°C.
The heart rates of 26°C acclimated fish decreased more rapidly than those of fish
acclimated to cooler temperatures (Fig. 3). Heart rates of the 19°C fish decreased at the same
rate as the 9°C and seawater acclimated fish until the seawater reached 9°C. There is no
significant difference between the heart rate of the 9°C and the seawater acclimated fish. At 1°C,
both maintain a heart rate over double the rate of the 19°C and 26°C fish.
Behavioral differences were also noted. At 1°C, the 9°C and seawater acclimated fish
were responsive to stimuli whereas the 19°C and 26°C fish were not. All of the fish survived the
temperature decrease to 1°C except for two of the 26°C acclimated fish.
Discussion
All of the fish except for the 26°C acclimated specimens demonstrated a typical Qio
relationship for cardiac activity as temperature was decreased from the acclimation temperature
to approximately 5C Since the 9°C, 14°C and 19°C heart rates are very similar at the shared
