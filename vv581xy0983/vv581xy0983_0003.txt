Introduction
As predominantly ectothermic animals, fish performance is greatly influenced by ambient
water temperature (Gerlach et al. 1990). In order for a species to survive, fish must maintain an
aerobic metabolism that supports growth, reproduction and foraging for food (Pörtner and
Farrell, 2008). Fish frequently select temperatures that allow them to most efficiently meet their
aerobic needs, and temperatures above and below this optimal temperature result in a decrease of
aerobic capacity lowering their fitness. While reduced fitness is observed at temperatures
outside of the optimal temperature range, fish may endure sub-optimal temperatures for limited
periods of time (Pörtner and Farrell, 2008). The overall temperature spectrum that an animal can
endure is known as the thermal window. This range of temperatures is based on how well an
animal can meet the oxygen demands posed by the metabolic demand at a given temperature.
Metabolism of ectotherms like fish increases with rising temperature (termed Qio effects) and
often approximately doubles for a 10°C rise in temperature. Temperature-dependence in whole
organism respiration is reflected in similar changes in the rate of cardiac function (Moffitt and
Crawshaw, 1983), which is to be expected due to the heart's central role in providing oxygen to
respiring tissues (Pörtner, Mark and Bock, 2004).
Since heart rate is coupled to both temperature and performance, the ability of the heart to
sustain adequate activity over a range of temperatures can greatly influence the ability of a fish to
survive over this thermal range. Cardiac physiology is therefore a key factor in niche expansion
and fish diversity (Gamperl and Farrell, 2004). Adaptation to living in a new temperature can
result in the evolution of a new species or reflect extreme cardiac plasticity within a species.
