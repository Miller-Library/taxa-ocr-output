Once the fish were anesthetized, they were placed ventral side up on a solid surface.
Wires were inserted on either side of the heart and hooked onto the pericardial cavity via a
needle. The needle was inserted just beneath the pelvic girdle almost parallel to the fish on either
side of the heart. Once the wire was hooked in place, the needle was removed. The wires were
crossed near the anus of the fish and secured in place by suturing to the skin. Veterinary
adhesive was applied over the wire holes and the suture area
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Following the electrode implantation procedure, the fish was placed into the experimental
tank and held upright until movement was restored. The ends of the wires were placed into a
voltage amplifier (P55 AC Pre-Amplifier, Grass Instrument Co.), which was connected to the
Powerlab system. The thermometers in the tank were calibrated to the correct temperature using
a two point calibration and configured into Powerlab. Aster an hour of recovery in the
experimental tank during which the temperature matched the acclimation temperature, the chiller
was switched on. The water was cooled at a rate of 4°C per hour until the temperature reached
1°C. Data were recorded continuously using the Powerlab system at a rate of 100 readings per
second.
Analysis of Results
Since the temperature decreased 4°C per hour, a degree change occurred roughly every
15 minutes. The ECG results were analyzed by counting the amount of cardiac contractions in a
20 second span every 15 minutes during the course of the experiment. The number of beats per
20 second interval was then multiplied by three to show beats per minute. The heart rates of the
three fish were averaged. The temperatures of the two submerged thermometers at each 15
