man-made and natural noxious substances may possess a multi-xenobiotic
resistance activity is essential to our understanding of organismal
detoxification mecnanisms and the biological impact of pollution and could
be usetil in risk assessment for regulatory policy.
INTRODUCTION
Many marine organisms survive and successfully reproduce in highly
pollured environments Some nave adapted to environments with high
loncentrarions of potentialiv cytotoxic hydrophobic organic compounds

nuindréds of man-made and natural toxins. (fig. 1) Such marine and estuarian
organisms employ xenopiotic resistance detoxification mechanisms of
which very uttie is understood.
In the past numerous studies on the effects of various pollutants on
marine organisms have been conducted. However, few detoxification
mechanisms nave been identified or are understood. Among these are
cytochrome P-450 detoxification; glutathione con jugation mechanisms;
stress proteins, such as heat shock proteins, and mixed function oxidases
(PFOs). Some of these mechanisms are not active in lower marine
inverteprates In fact, little work can explain which or how many
mecnanisms are employed in many invertebrates.
One recently suggested mechanism is similar to the multidrug

DISCUSSION
The results indicate MDR like transport activity in Urechiseggs,
Ascidianeggs, and muscle tussue. Such activity does not appear to be
present in echinoderm eggs. Although the evidence is limited, it suggests
that MOR like transport activity is correlated with a filter feeding lifestyle
Fluorescence assays and Western blots indicate that the sea urchins,
S purpuratus and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>L. pictus</span> and the sand dollar D excentricusdo not have
PIDR transport activity and do not have cross-reactivity to the C219
antibody. The sea stars P miniataand H leviuscula do not possess a
related protein and it is unclear whether the clam M nasuta the crab H
oregonensis or the scallop C hastata have a cross-reacting protein.
Altnough the C219 monoclonal antibody does not show cross-reactivity in
tne marine sponges Tethva aurant ium and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Microciona prolifera : Exact'>Microciona prolifera</span> it is again
unciear as to whether there is similar protein activity, due to conflicting
evigence by Kurelec and Pivcevic (in press). Finally, fluorescence activity
assavs and western blots clearly indicate the presence of an MDR like
transport activity in the mussel <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>Mytilus californianus</span> the tunicate Ascidia
ceratodes and Urechis caupa
As both, the fluorescence assay indicated activity and the Western
blot resulted in a positive cross reaction, it is possible to conclude that
Urechis caupoand Ascidia ceratodeshave a MDR-like gene which produces a
multi-xenobiotic resistance protein in its eggs. However, as Iwas unable to
defect tne presence of the protein in adult tissue, the organism may stop
proaucing the protein if it is no longer necessary. Both of these organisms
nave a thick epigermis that may serve to protect it from toxins, thereby
making the protein obsolete in the adult. Also, due to problems with
smudging in the western blots, organismal gut tissue needs to be retested
to form conclusions. Both of these organisms are filter feeding and reside
in toxin filled environments.
Mytilus californianisgill and mantle tissues reacted positively with
the C219 monoclonal antibody for a 138 kD protein. As the mussel was past
its spawning season ! was unable to conduct assays on its oocytes. This
filter feeder also showed cross reactions at higher (200 KD) and lower (34
kD) molecular weights. This could be because more than one protein with a
similar sequence and/or function is present, though lower molecular weight
bands are most likely the result of protease degradation.
Negative fluorescence assay results from sea urchin and sand dollar
eggs indicate that as these organisms show no differences in fluorescence,
there appears to be no transport protein activity of Rhodamine B. Also,
negative results on the immunoblots for these organisms and sea stars
indicate that the protein is not present in the organisms. Though the results
are not conclusive in themselves, they lead me to believe that echinoderms
do not possess a MDR like transport protein.
Assay attempts on the marine sponges Microcionaand Tethyawere
inconclusive. Individual cell dissociation, though possible, are very
difficult as many other symbiotic organisms live in sponge tissue and must
be separated from the sponge cells. In addition, individual cells were too
small to recora conclusive fluorescence readings due to high background
fuorescence interference. Despite these problems, the results from these
say attempts gave positive activity indications. Western blotting, on the
ofher hand, showed no cross reaction, though, Kurelec and Pivcevic from
vugoslavia have detected an MDR like 125 KD protein in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tethya : Exact'>Tethya</span> with a
polyclonal ant ibody (submitted) and have noted xenobiotic resistance
activity in tissue with radiolabelled drugs (submitted). This conflicting
evidence may be explained by the fact that the sponge is an extremely
primitive organism as compared to the mammals from which the C219
monoclonal antibody is created and that may be too specific, as this MDR¬
like transporter is likely to have evolved significantly. This also indicates
that other organisms have screened may also possess such a protein that
is not detectable with the C219 monoclonal antibody.
Immunoblot cross reactions at different molecular weights indicate
that there is likely to be a protein similar to the MDR p-glycoprotein. As
the monoclonal antibody is specific for the ATP binding cassette in the C
terminal region of the 170 kD mammalian MDR P-gp, it is quiet specific.
However, it is still general enough to have some degree of error by cross
reacting to other protein ATP binding cassettes with similar sequences.
Therefore, à negative cross reaction, though somewhat inconclusive has high
propability of indicating lack of protein. Ambiquous (smudged) positive
cross reactions may be the result of a cross reacting protein that had been
dégraded, put without a clear band are inconclusive. Positive cross
reactions at molecular weights differing from the 170 KD mammalian p¬
giycoprotein can be explained by evolutionary differences across phyla in a
protein with similar function as the mammalian MDR p-glycoprotein. Lower
molecular weight bands such as in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hemigrapsus : Exact'>Hemigrapsus</span> oregonensisor Ascidian
eggs, could be the result of protease degradation of a larger protein.
Attempts at using protease inhibitors such as EDTA, PMSF, and soybean
trypsin innibitor appeared not to be successful in preventing protein break
down if it had occurred. However, as isolation of the active protease is
often difficult, 1 may not be inhibiting the correct protease.
It was not possible to conduct fluorescence assays on individual cells
of many organisms as it is difficult to get gametes or dissociate tissue. In
some cases, the organism was not gravid or was past its spåwning season.
In others, the cells were not usable with this assay. For example, mediaster
produces eggs that are naturally fluorescent thereby making individual
fluorescence readings meaningless. Also, sponge tissue cells were too
small to conduct quant if iable fluorescence readings without high amounts
of background fluorescence interference
My results indicate that multi-xenobiotic resistance activity is
associated with filter feeders. The Urechis caupo, <span style='background-color:grey' title='Mytilus californianus : Fuzzy'>Mytilus californianis,</span>
and Asciala ceratodesare all filter feeders that habitate polluted
environments. Vrechig a sediment dweller, is exposed to concentrated
man-made and natural noxious substances. <span style='background-color:grey' title='Mytilus californianua : Fuzzy'>Mytilus californianusis</span> also a
resident of the sediments. The Ascigianis found under floats in Monterey
Marina wnich is depositea with pollutants. The echinoderms, on the other
hand live in sandy/rocky, relat ively unpolluted habitats, and may not need
and tnus nave not developed such xenobiotic resistance activity.
