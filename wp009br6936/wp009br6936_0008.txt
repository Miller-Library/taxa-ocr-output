cultures (See Fig. 1). Interestinglu, neurons benesth the outer lager of
undissociated clumps tended to survive exposure more often than those
which were sparselu dispersed in plating.
Glial cells were as heavily affected by 1 mil glutamate
exposure as neurons. In regions of culture plates containing glis and
neurons, both cell tupes were stained equally by trupan blue 1 dag after
glutamate exposure.
Quantitative determination of neuronal injurg or loss versus
olutamate concentration, measured in several cultures of a single
plating, is represented in Fig. 2. Although most neurons were destroged
bu exposure to 1 mM glutamate, a considerable number of apperentig
viable neurons were found 1 day after exposure. These surviving cells
excluded trupan blue and remained morphologically similar for several
daus. Cultures of cerebellar tissue, in particular, did not differ
substantially in cell visbility percentiles from control cultures(see Fig.
2, Day 2).
Discussion
The present studies indicste that glutamate receptors exist
on the cell membranes of marine surfperch neurons, and that glutamate
is a neurotosin in cell culture. In the concentration-effect relationship
for GMT on CHS neurons, as little as 100 uH glutamate can cause 452
cell death. This concentration of glutamate is only 12 of the 10 mri
concentration normally found in whole mammalien brain (Waelsch, 1951).
Few studies have been conducted on concentrations of glutamate in
marine vertebrate cell culture, but presumably, longer exposure times
