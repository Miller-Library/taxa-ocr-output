were 20-502 the size of neurons, flat, devoid of color, and
interconnected in dense mats. Counts of viable cells in regions of the
plate were calculated as a percentage of all cells on the plate and
compared to percent viability of control plates, which showed damage to
15-252 of neurons and glia.
Results
The protocol of Wolf and Quimby (1976) for general
dissociation of fish tissue for primary culture vis a trupsin digestion,
even for onlu 1 hour, led to excessive dissociation and cell death in this
studu. Then a manual dissociation was attempted using mocroelectrodes,
but these cultures were too sparsely plated, due to a lack of sufficientlg
dissociated tissue. Then manual trituration with forceps was attempted,
but the cultures were too densely plated with undissociated tissue
clusters. Finallu, brain tissue, which was minced and stirred in 1.252
dispsse for i hour, produced homogeneous monolagers of neurons and
dlial cells with sufficient densitg. In addition, 3 hours of polg-L-lgsine
costing of glass coverslips was necessary to assure proper adhesion of
cells in plating. If this process is carried out for less time, the cells
detsch during medium changes.
In fish brain cell cultures prepared as described, neurons
could be seen as small circular or oval cell bodies from which processes
extended. Heurons were either isolated, interconnected with other
neurons, or connected to a glial network. The glial cells were clear and
flat in morpholoqu, and half the size or less than the neurons present.
Cells were examined for glutamate neurotoxicity as early as several
