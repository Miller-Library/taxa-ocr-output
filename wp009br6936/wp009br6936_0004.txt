digestion at room temperature.
3) Hanual dissociation was attempted. After dissecting the brain from
the fish, the brain lobes were probed with glass microelectrodes, and
dissocisted tissue was plated.
4) The lobes were manually minced with sterile forceps into small
fragments and transferred onto culture plates where the fragments
were further triturated.
5) The method for best results was as follows:
Hature marine surfperch were sacrificed in an icewater bath, submerged
in a 1:1O dilution of household bleach, and sterilized topicallg with 75
ethanol. The brain was then removed and preserved in a sterile solution
of Hanks salts (Sigma) in which the salt concentration was incressed to
200 mtl Macl. The salt solution (pH 7.2) was buffered with 10 mri Hepes.
The brain lobes were then minced and transferred into a solution of
1.252 dispase (30 mg. dispase in 2.5 ml. Hanks) and stirred at 25 ?. for
1 hour. Subsequentlu the cells were plated for 30 minutes onto
autoclaved coverslips which had been costed with polg-L-lysine for 3
hours and rinsed with distilled water. After 172 hour, the plated cells
were placed in a 3 ml. bath of growth medium and incubated overnight at
17 C. The growth medium consisted of L-15 Leibovitz Hedium (Gibco),
5 fetal bovine serum, 12 L-glutamine Penicillin-Streptomgcin, and
20OmH Hacl at pH 7.4. The medium did not initially contain ang
glutamate, except in the serum, which according to the suppliers
information, contained less than 20 uf.
