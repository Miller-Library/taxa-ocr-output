EIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Glutamate receptors are expressed by neurons as early as Dag
in culture. Percentages of cell viability of cultures exposed to imM
glutamate (lower line, *) were plotted against percentages of the control
(upper line, D). Cell viabilities were already considerably lower than
control values on Dag 1. The relativelg high cell viability for Day 2 of
the culture exposed to glutamate could be explained by a high proportion
of cerebellar neurons, which are known not to express glutamate
receptors in mammals.
Eigure 2. Glutamate neurotoxicity is cumulative. Control cultures had
viabilities of 803 on Day 2 in culture. The higher the concentrations
Used, the greater the cell death observed.
Figure 39. Neurons in cell culture were identified bu their circular or
oval cell bodies, from which processes extended.
b. Neurons were found in isolated areas, connected in groups, or,
as in this figure, connected to a mat of glial celle.
Figure 4. Control cells in cultures stained with trupan blue excluded the
dye.
Figure 5a. Cell cultures exposed to glutamate for 5 minutes were tested
for viebility with trupan blue the following dag. After exposure to 5 mM
glutamate, as in this figure, only 23 of cells were undarnaged.
b. In some cultures exposed to 1 mil glutamate, viable
morphollogically intact neurons were replaced by debris within 24 hours.
This culture was stained with 0.4 2 trupan blue.
