acid in a 3 ml. medium bath for 2 hours at 17 *C. and 1 hour stirring
at room temperature. The cells were then transferred into 3 ml.
Hanks and observed on a low-light video microscope 400K. 1 um
jonomucin was added. Fura flourescence was recorded on wideo at
340 Hz and 360 Hz before and after ionomycin addition at 10 second
intervals. Then 1 uM manganese was added, after which
fluprescence frequencies at 340 Hz and 380 Hz were agsin recorded.
Cell cultures were also loaded with 25 ul fluo-3-AH and 10 ul
pleuronic acid in a 3 ml. medium bath for 30 minutes at room
temperature. The cells were then placed in 3 rl. Hanks and observed
with the low-light video microscope 400K. Fluorescence
frequencies were recorded on videotape continuously before and
after addition of 2 uH KCl.
Glutamate Exposure. Prior to glutamate exposure, the cultured celle
were examined under phase contrast 6OÃ–K and photographed after various
lengths of time in culture.
During glutsmate studies, the cells were bathed in the
control Hanks solution, to which various concentrations of glutamate
were added for S minutes at room temperature. In a triple exchange, the
cells were then washed in sterile Hanks (effective dilution 2 300),
placed in 3 ml. growth medium, and returned to incubation at 17 *C.
To assess the effects of glutamate exposure, the cells were
stained for 2-3 minutes at room tempersture with O.43 trupan blue, a
due normally excluded bu healthy cells, and examined under phase
contrast 600X. Meurons were identified by their relativelg large size and
dark cell bodies and processes. In contrast, the glial cells in culture
