for these reasons, it is believed that glutamate is an excitatory amino
scid neurotransmitter (Dichiera and Gessa, 1981). It has also been
demonstrated, however, that glutamate is a neurotoxin (Choi et al.,
1987). Hormallu, protective uptake mechanisms prevent excessive
glutamate from causing neuronal damage, but under abnormal
circumstances, namely the neurological disease states mentioned above,
glutamate has plaged a role in neurotoxicitg. Huch research has been
undertaken recentlu in mammals as to the mechaniem of GHI, its
connection to hupoxia, and, of course, to answer the question of why a
neurotransmitter would serve the dual function of a neurotoxin.
The mammalian CHS, however, is too intricate and comples
to studu the effects of glutamate in viva The purpose of this study was
to determine whether neurons of marine surfperch Lymslagsser
sggregete possess glutamate receptors, and in addition, whether these
neurons are susceptible to GHT. Harine surfperch might then serve as a
simple model in which to studi the phenomenon.  report hère that
glutamate receptors mag be expressed on surfperch CNS neurons and that
glutamate is a potent neurotoxin in vitre.

Cell Culture. Several methods of tissue dissociation were attempted
before a satisfactoru method was found to culture dense, viable
monolayers of neurons with a minimum of contamination:
1) The protocol of Wolf and Ouimby was closely followed with a 16-hour
2.52 trupsin digestion at 4 °0.
2) The same protocol was followed woth a 1, 2 and 3-hour trypsin
