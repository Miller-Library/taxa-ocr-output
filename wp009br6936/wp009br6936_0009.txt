with lower concentrations than those used in this study could be toxic.
This study merely touches on the existence of glutamate receptors and
the prospects of GMT in marine surfperch, and on the use of
Cumetegsster eggregate as a model for medical research on GNT in
hupoxiafischemia.
GMT in cell culture in vitra may be exaggerated in
comparison to neurotoxicity in vive, because the uptake mechanisme
which normallu maintain homeostasis by removing excess extracellular
amounts are absent in primary cell culture (Schwarcz et al.,1978). This
absence may also explain why gliotoxicity was equally prevalent in
culture, but is not seen when low doses of glutamate are used in viva
(Olney et al., 1971).
It is interesting that some neurons regularly survive in
cultures exposed to glutamate. This glutamate resistance could be
similar to the phenomenon seen in mamnmals, whereby some, not all,
regions of the brain are susceptible to GMT. In most of the experiments
described, all regions of the brain were dissociated and plated together,
without regard to origin. In addition, even within a single brain region,
some neurons do appear to be more vulnerable than others to injurg by
excitatori amino acids (Hadler et al., 1980; Kohler and Schwarcz, 1983).
A subject for further study would be to determine whether these
resistant neurons were a case of random sampling from the original
population, or what characteristics deem these neurons invulnerable to
GNT.
