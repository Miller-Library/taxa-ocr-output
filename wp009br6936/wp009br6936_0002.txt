Abstract
Research on rat neocortical neurons in primary cell culture
has shown that the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, glutamate,
causes neurotoxicitu, a phenomenon associated with neurological
disesses, including Huntingdon's disesse (Cogle and Schwarz, 1976),
olivopontocerebellar atrophy (Plaitakis et al., 1962), stroke (Rothman,
1984), and hupoglucemic encephalopsthg (Wieloch, 1985).
In the present study, brief exposure to glutamate was found
to couse cell death of neurons cultured from the brain of adult
marine surfperch, Lyrsstagsster aggregste A dose-toxicity study
suggested an EDg of 100-500 uM glutamate for a 5-minute exposure.
A toxicity versus age in culture study showed that glutarate receptors
mey be expressed as earlu as 24 hours in culture. A dose response study
on Day 2 in culture indicated that glutamate neurotoxicity (GMT) is
curulative; the higher the glutamate concentration used the greater the
cell desth.
Some neurons survived short exposure to glutamate. This
resistance could be due to a lack of glutamate receptors on neurons from
certain regions of the brain. Cerebellar neurons exposed to glutamate,
for example, showed no deviation in viability from the control
percentage.
Introduction
The amino acid glutamate is present at concentrations of
several millimolar in the mammalian brain (Waelsch, 1951). Glutamate
has been shown to have an excitatory effect on neurons of the CNS, and
