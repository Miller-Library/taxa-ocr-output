Ecology of P. sten
(Kendle-Tau Rank-Order correlation test). Ideally, the graph should
start in the lower left-hand corner (high temp., low oxygen conc., low
abundance) and proceed in a somewhat linear fashion to the upper right-
hand corner (low temp., high oxygen conc., high abundance), however
fluctuations occur because of the varying conditions of the areas
sampled in this study.

TEMPERATURE
Temperature was recorded on a standard centigrade thermometer.
All temperatures were taken at between the -1.0 and -2.0 ft. tidal
levels during the early morning hours.
A high degree of correlation also exists between temperature and
relative abundance (fig. 3). The actual plot, found by plotting all
the points separately, is found in the upper right-hand corner while
the larger graph relates the mean teperatures over selected ranges to
give a better visual representation of the strong correlation which
exsists. Temperature seems definitely to be a factor in determining
the distribution of the isopod.

LEGREE OF EXPOSUN
Degree of exposure (table 2) was determined by direct observation..
The categories are somewhat arbitrary but they do serve their purpose in
further characterizing the areas.
Again, a strong correlation exists between degree of exposure and
abundance of P. stenops (fig. 4). A rough area seems to be the most
preferred.
