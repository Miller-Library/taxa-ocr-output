Ecology of P. stenops
was previously found to survive in. In an even higher concentration
the isopods showed signs of weakening. All isopods in the clean tub
were still living at the termination of the experiment, 14 hours after
the LT50 time of the dirty water. The oxygen level recorded in the
water (3.2 ppm) was lower than that in the dirty tub. This implies that
there is some other factor involved, other than oxygen deprivation, af-
fecting a lower survival rate in the dirty water.
SSICATION
Another probable factor limiting P. stenor
s to the lower inter-
tidal zone is perhaps its rate of dessication. A standard LT50 des-
sication tolerance test (fig. 7 ) was run on 12 animals. They were
placed in a dry glass bowl and kept under constent observation as a
short LT50 time was expected. The animals were kept separated, using a
metal probe, to reduce clumping, a common method utilized by terrest:
rial
isopods to reduce water loss.
The short LT50 time (1.5 hours) implies that it would not be ad-
vantageous to P. stenops to be left outof the water, exposed to the air.
for long periods of time, such as during a low tide. This could defin¬
itely be a factor in restricting the animal to the lowest tidal level.
ALGAE GROUTH AND FOOD CHOICE
Feeding marks were observed on both L
inaria and Egregia, in the
field and in the lab, and Nereocystis in the lab. Gut analysies were
performed on 20 P. stenops collected from various areas.
