Ecology of P. stenops
equally in half by a chalk line on the bottom of the pool; one side
directly oxposed to the periodic wave shock and the other relatively
calm.
The isopods showed no preference for either the rough or calm
areas indicating that perhaps water motion is not a deternining factor
but the conditions that result from such wave action are advantageous
to the animals' survival.
Y" VS CLEAN WATER
DRI
At the termination of the wave impact experiment the Egregia
rachises in the rough area of the tank were noticably cleaner than the
rachises in the calm area. It was speculated that perhaps the isopods
require a relatively clean environment in which to thrivel A LT50
test to determine survival rates in clean vs "dirty" water (fig. 7) was
run. Two disposable plastic tubs were filled with equal amounts of sea
water and a measured amount of Egregia was placed in each. A one mil-
limeter layer of "dirt", consisting of fecal material of P. stenops and
decayed Egregia recovered from the bottom of an aquarium, was placed on
the bottom of the
Irty tub. Both tubs were placed in a constant temp-
erature (12.8â€¢0) water bath. No further water was allowed to enter
either tank. Observations were taken at irregular intervals. Oxygen
readings were taken at the LT50 time in the dirty tub and at the termin-
ation of the experiment in the clean tank.
Survival rates under oxygen deprivation conditions were markedly
decreased in the dirty water. The final oxygen reading in the dirty water
(5.6ppm) was much higher than those concentrations (1-2 ppm) P. stenops
