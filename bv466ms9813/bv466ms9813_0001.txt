Ecology of P. stenops
NTRODUCTICN
Pentidotheastenops (Bencdict 1898) is an isopod (Grustacea) found
exclusively in the lower intertidal (+1.0 --2.0 ft. tide level and
below), or as more precisely expressed by Doty (1946) between LHLW, the
highest level exposed once a day and LLLW, a level rarely exposed. It
is reported by Hatch (1947) to be found from Coos Bay, Oregon to
Monterey Bay, Calif, Since its color range (Saccardo's olive green to
black according to Ridgway's Color Standard) matches that of its plant
hosts, Egregia and Laminaria, the animals are not easily seen in the
field.
Very little is known about this animal beyond the standard anatom-
ical description (Menzis, 1950). An investigation of its habitat and
its relatidship to the plant hosts together with a study of bchavior
atterns of this crustacean was the object of this present study.
