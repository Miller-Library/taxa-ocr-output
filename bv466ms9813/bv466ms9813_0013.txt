PHCTOTROPY
P. stenops showed obvious photonegativism in the field as they were
predominantly foundon the underside of Egregia rachises and when held
exposed to the sun would scurry back around to the shady side. A light
vs dark experiment was devised (fig.11) to test the significance of
this behavior. A disposable plastic tub was covered with black paper

and holes were punched at either end. A rachis of)

a, lipped of
its blades in the middle three-quarters of length, was placed longi-
tudinally in the box and fixed in position by running the two ends
through the two holes. The box was clamped, submerged, in an aquarium.
open to the window of the aquarium. Two one-hundred watt bulbs were
placed facing the open side and an isopod was placed either facing the
open lighted side or on the dark side, always facing up. The lights
vere left on for two hours per trial.
The results of this experiment (fig. 7 ) show conclusively that
sienops is photonegative which explains the field finding of the
predominance of isopods on the underside of
ia rachises.
P
stenops found on Laminaria will often times have a paraeopod
hooked on another leaf and have pulled it over itself to cover its
body in a kind of sandwich of Laminaria blades. This curious be-
havior can also be explained by their photonegativism,
ADAPTION TO HOST
A direct correlation between size of isopod and size of rachis or
blade of algae was found through observations made in the field. It
