Ecology of P. stenops

became a temporary home for the isopods as they would immediately grasp
onto such materials after having run into it during the course of one
of their short swimming bursts. I am under the impression that stenops
utilizes its limited ability to swim only under extreme circumstances
such as when it becomes dislodged from its algal host,
COLOR VARLATION
Color variation in P. Stenops is another highly adaptive character-
istic it possesses. The current two species of Egragia found in the
gata and E. menzisii, range in color from a light
area studied, E. laevis
olive green to almost a black, including all variations of green and
brown. As was mentioned in the introduction, the stenops observed in
the study area were found to possess color variations in the exact same
range. This enables them to utilize camouflage as a defense mechanism
against predators (and collectors I may note).
GENERAL
The general activity of P. stenops in the field consists of feeding
(algae browsing) and copulation. As in other Idotheas the male grasps
onto the back of a non-brooding female and waits until she molts,
which time copulation occurs. The male and female then separate, and,
to what extent they could be observed, they do not encounter each other
again until the female delivers her young and becomes, once again, non-
brooding. Males and females in the field were found to occur in equal
numbers.
Although it appears that many parameters of the lifestyle of the
marine isopod P. stenops have been investigated here, a great deal more
remains to be investigated into this crustacean.
