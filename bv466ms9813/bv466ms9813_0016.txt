Ecology of P. stenon
ï»¿16

SORMARY
Populations of P. stenops were observed and sampled along selected
treas on the Central California coast. Ecological factors affecting
their population distribution as well as characteristic behavior pat-
ns were noted. Lab experiments were performed to test the signi-
ficance of such observations on the general well-being of the isopod.
