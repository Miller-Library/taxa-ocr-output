Ecology of P. stenong
MET
IELD WORK
In order to find the natural habitats and to plot the distri-
bution of P. stenops on the Monterey Peninsula, sixteen areas were
chosen because of their diversity between the Coast Guard Breakwater.
at the western end of Monterey Harbor and Mission Point, at the western
end of Carmel Beach which is the midpoint of Carmel Bay, a coastline of
7-8 miles (fig. 1). In this area there are very rough (Pescadero Pt.)
to calm (Stillwater Cove) situations, and intermediate locations (table
2). Because of their local diversity, three of these areas (2,6.7)
were divided in half giving a total of nineteen stations. Each station
was characterized concerning temperature, oxygen, degree of exposure.
algal growth and selected physical parameters (table 2). Population
densities were scored (table 1) on Egregia and Laminaria which were
found to be the favored host plants. Since conditions varied from area
to area as to algal growth and physical characteristics these designations
turned out to be very flexible and very few arcas actually fit into
one category in all respects. Each arca was sampled at least three
times and the mean of the values obtained is found in table 2.

OXYGEN CONCENTRATION
Oxygen concentrations were determined by taking samples in 60nl
glass stoppered bottles and performing a standard Winkler oxygen anal-
ysis in the lab.
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between oxygen concentration and ab-
undance in the areas sampled. There is greater than a 99.9% cor-
relation between oxygen concentration and number of specimens found
