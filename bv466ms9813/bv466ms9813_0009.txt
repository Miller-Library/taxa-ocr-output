Ecology of P. stenops
the guts analyzed from field collected isopods. Eight stenops were
placed in an aquarium containing only scraped (to remove possible
epiphytes)
llospadix. An analysis of these gut contents after a
week of exposure showed Phyllospadix exclusively.
Egregia, the various epiphytes that grow upon it and Laminaria
seem to be the most common algae used for food by P. stenops. They apÂ¬

PERFORMANCE
A performance test relative to feeding and temperature was run
to assegs the limiting factors determining the distributions of P.
stenops. It had been noticed in lab kept animals that as conditions
deteriorated dueto oxygen depletion, a rise in temperature and a change
han ono
of food, animals lost their ability totheir host plants. It was reasoned
that a test of their strength to hang on would be indicative of their
physical condition.
A seawater fire hydrant was utilized in order to simulate a strong
current in the following way: A rachis of Egregia was placed in an
aluminum gutter (fig.12), one end of which received an onrush of seawater
from the spout of the hydrant. Twelve animals were grown on each of
three different substrates, one at a different temperature (fig.8) for
48 - 72 hours before testing. It was felt that food and temperature
variances were most convenient to test. It would have been proper to
test also oxygen levels but this presented too many complications,
All twelve anpimals grown under cach condition were placed on the
