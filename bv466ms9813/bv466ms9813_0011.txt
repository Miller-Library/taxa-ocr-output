Ecology of P. stenops

periodic water motion. The dgree to which P
P. stenops can survive in a
heavy surf zone can be noted in that its abundance diminishes as the area
becomes very rough.
That
stenons occurs only at the lowest intertidal levels explains
why it is susceptible to dessication. Even though Egregia, its major
host and food source, occurs up to the ti.0 ft. tidal level, P. stenops
can be observed only from approximately the-O.5 ft. level and on down.
From the data collected an "ideal" area for the maintenance of
a sizable population of I
stenons can be described. It is the following:
A generally rough area with a temperature range between 10' and 15Â°G.
he oxygen concentration of the water must be above 8.00 ppm during the
day and the water should be relatively clean (note: area 6b, sewer out-
fall). Both Egregia and I
inaria should be plentiful.
