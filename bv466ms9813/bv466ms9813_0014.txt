Ecology of P. stenops
14
seems that P. stenops can not puncture the algae from the top with
their hook-like, semi-chelate legs but rather must hook them around
the opposite side of the rachis or blade where it can and does puncÂ¬
ture the alga. This phenomenoowas demonstrated by placing an isopod
on a wide blade of-Laminaria that it could not reach around. It was
very easy to push off, not being attached to the alga by any means.
In the field one often finds an isopod on a blade too wide for it
to stretch both legs around. It will, in such instances, be to one
side so that it can at least loop the paraeopods of one side of its
body around to secure itself. This behavior is further evidenced by
baby Stenops which are found exclusively on the basal portion of the
lateral blades of Egregia (Robert G. Sellers - unpublished work),
These tiny blades are perfect for the small stenops to hang onto
SWIMIING
P. Stenops is a rather poor swimmer for an animal which spends
most of its life underwater. The only function that swimming seems to
serve is that of finding something to grab onto. aStenops were never
seen swimming in the field. Even when observed underwater during high
tides the animals were always seen clutching to either Egregia or
Laminaria. This observation was further evidenced in the lab. When
P. Stenops were placed in an empty dish thoy would engage in short
swimming bursts in all directions, presumably searching for something
to grab on to. Any material that was introduced int the dish, includ-
ing: metal forceps, other stenops, fingers, glass slides and wire mesh
