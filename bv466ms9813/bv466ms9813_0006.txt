Ecology of P. stenop
It was concluded that oxygen concentrations of 3-4 ppm resulted in
a weakened state of the isopod, probably reducing its ability to hold on
to the algae in the heavy surf zone.
TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE
A standard LT50 temperature tolerance test was performed to deter-
mine sensitivity of P. stenops to temperature variations. Sixteen iso-
pods were placed in each of four disposable plastic tubs which were
placed in four different temperature environments (fig. 73), A measured
amount of E
gregia was placed in each tub and the four tubs were oxygenated
every four hours. Readings were taken at irregular intervals.
The isopods seem to be extremely sensi¬
tive to slight variations in
temporature. At 15 C their LT50 was 26 hours, a startling result when
one considers that temperatures along the coast exceed this at dif-
ferent times of the year. Temperature could definitely be a limiting
factor as P. stenops is found to occur predominantly in the rough in-
tertidal zones where a constant stirring up of the water insures a rel-
atively low temperature,where a calm area remains in a rather stagnant
tate and the water is allowed to warm up.
EXPOSURE
A rough vs smooth water experiment was performed on thirty isopods
to determine their preference to water motion and the periodic impact of
waves. A wave machine (fig.8) was constructed which created a water dis¬
turbance every 56 seconds. The isopods were evenly distributed according
to size and sex along three Egregia rachises, which were immersed in a
confined measured area in a large saltwater pool. T
The area was divided
