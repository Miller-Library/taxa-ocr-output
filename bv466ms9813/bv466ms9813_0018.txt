Ecology of P. stenops
18

FIGURS LE
1) A map noting the specific aicas along the Monterey Peninsula that
were sampled in this study (5cm = imi.).
2) A combined line and bar graph showing the strong correlation between
oxygen concentration and abundance of P. stenors in the areas sampled,
Temporature and oxygen are also related and fluctuations in an idcally
llnear plot occurred because of thevariable conditions in the arcas.
3) A bar graph relating selected mean temperatures observed to abun-
E stenops. Included is a line graph relating the actual
dance pr1.
mperature values obtained to abundance.
4) A line graph relating the mean degree of exposure of all the areas
sampled to the abundance of animals in the field.
3) A bar graph summarizing all the information gathered in the field
(Temp., oxygen levels, degree of exposure, abundance)
raph showing the respiration rates of three sizes of stenops,
6) A line
7) Data tables summerizing the lab experiments.
8) A bar graph comparing the performances of stenops exposed to the en-
vironments indicated.
9) Pictures of the gut contents of random sampled stenops.
10) Current tube used to simulate currents of water which occur along
Egregia rachises.
11) Black-box setup used for light/dark experiment.
12) Trough and Egregia orientation for performance test.
13) Wave machine used for causing periodic impacts of water in the rough
vs calm, water experiment.
