Ecology of P. stenops

rachis at one time. An initial problem arose during the first runs in
that it became clear that the isopods showed erratic responses to their
new conditions and some repeatedly fell off. A proceedure was developed
whereby after the twolvo were placed on the rachis, the water was turned
on so that only a slight current was created. Those that did not hang
on were removed. If such animals numbered not more than half (6) then
the run was continued and the water was turned on full. The flow was
kept up until half the isopods were swept away. The time was recorded
from the point of the first rush of water when turned on full to the time
when the last isopod was swept off. The numbers in the columns of fig.
8 refer to the numberof animals left after the initial wash,
The results seem to indicate that indeed food and temperature do
affect the isopod's physical well-being as sharp drops occur in the
time able to hang on as tho diet and temperature were varied from the
normal. This is more evidence that both food (algae) and temperature are
limiting factors in the distribution of P. stenops.

DISCUSSION
The results of the lab work correlate quite well with observations
and recordings made in the field. It is obvious that not one single
factor is resposible for P. stenops occuring in abundance where they do
but rather it is a combination of most of the factors considered that
determines their presence in a given area. It has been shown that it is
not the actual movement of water in a rough area that is beneficial for
the success of a population of P. stonops, but the oxygen levels, temp-
erature and cleanliness of water resulting from the effects of the heavy.
