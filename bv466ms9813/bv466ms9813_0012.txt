Ecology of D. stenops

NATURAL HISTORY NOTE
Some interesting behavior patterns in the field were noted dur-
ing sampling excursions and they will be considered here.
ORIENTATION
The first concerns the particular orientation of P, stenops on
Egregia stipes. No matter which way the current is flowing in the
ocean there is always a flow of water outward from the holdfast to the
end of the rachis on Egregia. It was observed that most of the stenops
oriented themselves so that they were facing in the direction of. i.e..
antennae towards,the apex-ofthe stipe. A current tube (fig. 10) was
constructed to test the significance of theis observation and the re¬
sults (fig. 7 ) show that a significant number of isopods prefer this
orientation.
Animals were placed both facing towards and away from the current.
four at a time, on a rachis of Egregia and exposed for two hours. From
the data (fig. 7 ) it is seen that P, stenops do prefer to face away
from the current a significant amount of the time and this result agrees
with the field observations.
It was also noted that when facing towards the apex of the rachis
the isopod assumes a more hydrodynamically favorable position as com-
pared with facing the current head on. The telson is pressed down upon
the surface of the rachis in such a way as to allow the water to pass
over and around the body with very little lifting and pulling of the
animal. This would appear to be extremely advantagcous to P. stenops
for its survival in the wave swept areas in which it is most commomly
