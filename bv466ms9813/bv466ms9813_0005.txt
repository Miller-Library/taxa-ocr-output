Ecology of P. stenops
LAB WORK
From the field data it was suspected that oxygen, temperature and
degree of exposure were possible limiting factors for the distribution
of P. stenogs. Lab experiments were undertaken to confirm these sus¬
picions.


OXIGEN TULERANCE
An oxygen tolerance test was run in which one animal was placed
in a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask containing sea water at a recorded temperature
and oxygen level. An oxygen probe connected with a rubber plug was used
to stopper the flask. The animals were confined in a screen cage and
as
stirring flea was placed on the bottom of the flask. The temperature
was ke
puconstant by placing the flask in a water bath. Readings were
taken at irregular intervals.
The oxygen graph (fig. 6) shows similar curves for all three size
sifications of P. stenops. T
clas
he interesting point is that the animals
were still living in oxygen concentrations as low as i-2
pm. During
the night in the field it is known that actual oxygen levels approach
such low values as the algae do not photosynthsize during the dark
hours. It would be of adaptive significance to P. stenops to be able to
exist under such conditions. However, it was also noticed that the
isopods become weakened when the oxygen concentration level fell to
below 3-4 ppm as they gripped their soreen cages loosely and sometimes
let go of the wire mesh completely. Atsuch low oxygen levels they
open¬
ed their uropods and weakly beat their pleopods, their respiratory mech-
anisms.
