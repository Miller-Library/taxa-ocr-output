ACKNOWLELGEMENTS
I would first like to thank EMBO Sellers, without whose help on
those cold, foggy, dark and sometimes wet mornings the data for this
project would never have been completed. I would next like to thank
Chris Harrold, without whose brilliant ideas some of the more original
apparatus would never have gotten off the ground. I would like to ac-
knowledge Mr. John Kono for his helpful assistance irseeing me through
some of my more adventrous projectsandSteve Pratt, Bob Barmeyer and
Porter Storey for their watchful eyes when I just had to get some
sleep deserve recognition.
I would especially like to thank Dr. I. A. Abbott for her as-
sistance throughout the quarter, her fantastic and timely epicurean
preparations and most of all her patience and understanding.
I offer my final thanks to the 24 hour bakery on Lighthouse ave.
