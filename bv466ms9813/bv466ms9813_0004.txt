Ecology of P. stenops
The only physical characteristic affecting the distribution of
P. stenops is that there must be a rocky substrate availible for the
algae to grow on.
A greater abundance is found where both Egregia and Laminaria are
gia must be present.
aminaria may be absent but E
present (table 2). I

LSCUSSION
Fig, 5 sums up the field work by relating all the factors con-
sidered on the previous three graphs. The numbers in parenthesis de-
note the number of areas with the designated degree of esposure. It
should be noted that a population of P. stenops was never found in calm
areas where the highest mean temperatures and lowest mean oxygen levels
also were recorded. The rough areas, characterized by low temperatures
and high oxygen concentrations, seem to be the preferred areas for the
existence of larger populations of the isopod. The abundance level
rops off as the areas get very rough which must besolclyto the heavy
wave action as the oxygen concentrations and temperatures are comparable
to those recorded inthe rough areas.
