vigorously shaken at regular intervals for 15 minutes at 4 C
(Gross et al., 1965; Slater and Spiegelman, 19660). It was
then placed in a Sorvall RC-2B Centrifuge at 12,500 rpm (20,000 g's)
for 3 minutes. The aqueous phase was collected and subjected
to 2 additional phenol extractions. The aqueous phase of the
3rd extraction was incubated for 15 minutes with.25 mg of
DNAase (Sigma Chem. Co.) before being extracted a Uth time
with phenol.
Two volumes of cold 75% ethanol were added to the aqueous
phase that was collected after the Ath phenol extraction and
then the precipitated RNA was stored for 1 hour at 3 C to allow
settling of the precipitate.
This precipitate was then centrifuged and washed with 75%
ethanol and dissolved in 3.5 ml of the original homogenization
media, andincubated for 15 minutes. This 2nd treatment with SLS
was to assure removal of lipids. The solution was then
subjected to a final phenol extraction and the collected aqueous
phase was precipitated with ethanol as before. After one hour
of refrigeration the precipitate was washed with ether and
then with 752 ethanol. It was then dissolved in.5 ml of sodium
acetate buffer (without SLS or Bentonite) and used for sedimentation
analysis.
Sedimentation Analysis:
A 20% - 5% sucrose gradient was used. The sucrose was
dissolved in sodium acetate buffer and stirred with bentonite,
l mgm/ml, overnight to remove any RNAase (Gross et al., 1964).
The .5 ml RNA sample was layered onto the top of the gradient by
18.
