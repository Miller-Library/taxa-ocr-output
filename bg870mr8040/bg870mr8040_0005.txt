the method of Bri
ten & Roberts (1960). An I.E.C. model B-35
ultracentrifuge, with a SB-206 rotor, was used at 35,000 rpm
(206,000 g's) for 8 hours. The sucrose gradient was checked
for linearity with a sucrose refractometer (American Optical Co.).
Glucose Oxidase (Sigma Chem. Co.) was used as a sedimentation
velocity marker according to the method of Martin & Ames (1960).
A Yale Luer-Lok 216 hypodermic needle was used to
puncture the centrifuge tubes. Four-drop fractions were collected
(approximatelyl.3 ml), with 0.1 ml of each fraction used for
Optical Density measurements at 260mA3. Carrier RNA (---mgm)
was added to the remainderof the fraction and the RNA precipitated
by addition of 5 mls. of 5% TCA. The precipitate was collected
on a Whatman Glass Filter GF/B, washed two times with 752 ethanol.
