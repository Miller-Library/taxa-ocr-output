Preparation of Ovigerous Lamellae:
Pollicipes polymerus were collected from Mussel Point,
Pacific Grove, California. A pair of ovigerous lamellae, approximately
.5 grams, were removed from the same animal and placed in Millipore
Filtered Sea Water at 13Â° C. Care was taken to use ovigerous
lamellae of the same size, and experimentation was commenced within
4 hours of removal. Hatched nauplius larvae were obtained from
ovigerous lamellae that were placed in glass dishes of Millipore
Filtered Sea Water at 13 C (Hilgard, 1960).
RNA Extraction:
Ovigerous lamellae were incubated for one hour, before
C+"-Uridine (Calbiochemical Co.) was added, in sea water containing
508/ml of streptomycin (Sigma Chem. Co.) and 300 units/ml of
penicillin (Sigma Chem. Co.). Conditions for pulse lableing
zperiments are specified under the respective graphs.
The incorporation of C-Uridine was stopped by placing
the ovigerous lamellae in a homogenizer with 3.5 ml of homogenization
media and raoidly freezing in a dry ice-acetone bath. The homog.
media was composed of sodium acetate buffer,.O1 M, pH 5; Nacl, O.1M;
Mgclo, 10 2 M; with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), 0.5%; and
bentonite 1 mg ml.
