INTRODUCTIO!
There has been alot of investigation recently, concerning
RNA synthesis in the indeterminant embryos of Echinoids (Glisin &
Glisin, 1964; Gross et al., 1964; Gross et al., 1965; Nemer, 1963;
Slater & Spiegelman, 1966a, 1966b; Stavy & Gross, 1967; Whiteley
et al., 1966; Wilt, 1963). Little experimentation has been carried
out with determinant, spiral cleaving embryos as in the barnacle
Pollicipes polymerus. The goose barnacle is distributed along
the exposed rocky coast of Western North America from British
Columbia to the middle of Baja, California (Cornwall, 1925). The
eggs of the barnacle pass down the oviducts to the atria, where they
receive a protective coating which glues them together into masses.
These masses eventually come to lie in√¢the mantle cavity on either
side, where they are pressed flat to form the two ovigerous
lamellae (Hilgard, 1960). In a pair of ovigerous lamellae taken from
any one parent, embryos appear to be synchronous and develop until
they are hatched out as nauplius larvae. The technique employed
in this paper is radioactive lableing with C-Uridine with stages
ranging from cleavage to the second molt after hatching.
