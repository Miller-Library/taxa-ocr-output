m. Moore Gull Predation on Nuttallina
Page 2
Introduction
Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847) is an inter-
tidal chiton often found in association with the mussel
Mytilus califorgianus (Conrad,1837), and the barnacle
Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby, 1833) on californian rocky
shores (Ricketts & Calvin, 1952).
This report is about predation on N. californica by
the western gull, Larus occidintalis (Audubon, 1839).
The gulls are voracious and opportunistic feeders
(Hubbs et al., 1970). After feeding, the birds regurgitate
undigested material, particularly the bones, shells and
exoskeletons of their prey; consequently examination of
regurgitation pellets (hereafter "pellets") vields
information on the gulls' food choice.
Materials & Methods
The study was conducted from May 10 to June 1.
1974 at Granite Point, a precipitous rocky peninsula
located in the Point Lobos State Park Reserve (Monterey
County).
The eighteen western gulls observed during the study
appeared to have already established breeding territories.
They were studied during the beginning of their breeding
season (Harper, 1971; Tinbergen, 1953), and each gull was
seen daily near a specific nesting site. Breeding animals
restructed much of their foraging to the nearby rocky
intertidal zone and offshore waters. Alien gulls were rarely
seen in the study area.
