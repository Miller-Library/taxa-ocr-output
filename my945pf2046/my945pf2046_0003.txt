Besults & Discussion
A total of 36 fresh pellets and an estimated
total of 65 old pellets were collected and analyzed.
Ihe results are shown in Table 1.
While plates of the barnacle Pollicipes polymerus
were the most common material found in the pellets.
an observation in accord with Martini (1966), over
a quarter of the pellets examined contained the plates
of at least one Nuttallina.
Of 24 old pellets containing Nuttallina, only
two had plates of three animals and none had more
than that. The four fresh pellets containing Nuttallina
had plates from 3, 8, 9, and 11 animals. A likely
explanation seems that one or several gulls
changed their feeding habits during the course
of the study, either by feeding in an area
containing a higher density of Nuttallina or by deliberately
seeking out Nuttallina in greater numbers.
The data indicate that gulls feeding in
the Pollicipes polymerus area concentrate most heavily
on P. polymerus.(Table 1). This might be explained
by the easy accessibility of P. polymerus to the gull
or by the gull actively seeking out the P. polymerus,
due to its taste or some other factor. In 22 of the
28 pellets containing Nuttallina californica, P. polymens
was also present. The gulls were likely eating the
N. californica and P. polymerus in proportion to
the numbers they were encountering.
