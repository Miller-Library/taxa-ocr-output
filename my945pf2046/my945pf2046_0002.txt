M. Moore Gull Predation on Nuttallina
Page 3
Granite Point proved excellent for my study.
The gulls were rarely disturbed and the brooding sites
on bare rock were far enough'from tourist trails that
the pellets were not disturbed.
After the gulls were counted, accessible brooding
sites were marked and old pellets were collected and
Characterized. Each of the sites was then visited
daily and fresh pellets were collected.
Many of the old pellets had fallen apart and
their contents scattered, thus quantification was
difficult. Fresh pellet size was used to estimate
the number of old pellèts at a site. This uas done
by spreading the contents of fresh pellets to the
same density as that of the remains of old pellets
and comparing the areas covered.
The population of Nuttallina californica around
Granite Point was estimated by counting the nümber
of N. californica per square meter in quadrates every
10 meters along the shore. Areas of markedly differing
densities were thus defined and the numbers of N. californica
were found by multiplying the average density of N.
californica by the area size. The totals for each
area were added, which gave an estimate of the total
number of N. californica in the study area.
Finally, early morning activities of foraging
gulls were observed on three separate days.
