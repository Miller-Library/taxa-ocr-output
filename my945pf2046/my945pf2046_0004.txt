M. Moore Gull Predation on Nuttallina
The 43 pellets containing P. polymerus but no N. californica
may represent foraging in a zone with a high P. polymerus
to N. californica ratio.
The low number of Mytilus californianus shells
in the pellets is probably due to the gulls' habit
of breaking open the mussels and eating the flesh,
instead of ingesting the whole shell.
The high densities of M. californianus and Pollicipes
polymerus probably act as "predation-buffer" For
the N. californica as has been found for predation
on these organisms by starfish (Landenberger, 1968).
Isopods were found only in fresh pellets; if
left over night these lightweight pellets would be
swept away by wind. Thus, the isopods probably made
up more of the gulls diet than Table 1 indicates.
Barnacle shells, chiton plates, mussel shells, and
limpet shells appeared to be quantitatively recoverable
from month-old pellets.
The contents of the pellets indicate opportunistic
feeding of the gulls and indicate the gulls
often feed as a group, concentrating a days effort
on a habitat. On the morning of May 24 all the gulls
were observed to be feeding on schooling fish,
and all but one of the pellets that day and the next
contained only fish bones.
The effect of predation by the western gulls
on Nuttallina californica can be estimated by assuming
three things.
