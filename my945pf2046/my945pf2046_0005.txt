Gull Predation on Nuttallina
Page 6
First, the foraging of the gulls is limited to the
general area around Granite Point, due to the gulls
breeding behavior and to the abundant food sources
around the point. The second assumption is that each
gull regurgitates one pellet per day. The final assumption
is that there is an average of 0.6 N. californica
per pellet. This is based on the overall ratio of
52 Nuttallina insthe 102 pellets found. The breeding
season of the western gull is roughly 90 days (Schreiber.1970:
linbergen, 1953), so the best estimate to be made
is as follous:
18 gulls x 1 pellet/day x O.6 chitonsx
90 days

The number of Nuttallina in the area was estimated
at b,500, the average density being approximately
3 Nuttallina/meter-squared around the point; consequently
the gulls preyed on approximately 15% of the Nuttallina
around the point during the breeding season. This
estimate could be clearly be improved with the attainment
of more precise data; yet it serves to indicate the
possibility that western gull consumes a significant
proportion of Nuttallina in some localities.
Summary
In a study of the contents of western gulls' regurgitation
pellets, Pollicipes polymerus, the gooseneck barnacle,
was shown to be the most abundant material. The chiton
