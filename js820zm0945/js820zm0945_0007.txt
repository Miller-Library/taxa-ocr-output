Effects of Guano
Page 8
The guano plants have a smaller surface to volume
ratio than the carrageenan rich control plants being
shorter, thicker and less branched. These morphological
traits may have developed as a means of compensating for
a relative lack of carrageenan in combatting a deadly
desiccation at low tide.
Conclusions
(1) This study showed that there were quantifiable differences
between guano and non-guano areas and that these
differences could be attributed to guano.
(2) Figure 8 summarizes the conclusions that can be drawn
from this study. As nitrogen and guano levels increase
phycoerythrin content rises while carrageenan conÂ¬
centrations drop.
This investigation underscores the ability of biological
(3)
organisms to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions.
Through their morphological changes, plants residing
in high guano exposed areas have been able to respond
successfully to an environmental stress.
