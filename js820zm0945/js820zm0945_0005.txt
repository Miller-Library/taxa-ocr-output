Effects of Guano
Page 6
Figure 3A depicts the differences between G. papillata
distal frond thickness from guano and non-guano areas.
Guano G. papillata were shown to be significantly (p£.01)
thicker than non-guano G.papillata.
Figure 3B depicts the differences in R-phycoerythrin
content between guano and non-guano plants. Guano G. papillata
were found tohave significantly (p2.01) more phycoerythrin.
Figure 4 depicts the carrageenan content as a percentage
of dry weight in guano and non-guano G. papillata. Non-
guano algae were shown to have signifieantly (p7.05) more
carregeenan than guano algae.
The results of the growth experiment are presented
in figure 5. No appreciable increase in phycoerythrin
was exhibited in any of the conditions. NH, and guano
both had the same effect in decreasing the phycoerythrin
content in the study site plants. However, the control
and PO, condition decreased the absorption to a greater
extent than guano or NH,. In the non-guano algae, NH,,
NO, and guano had the same effect in maintaining the phy¬
coerythrin content constant. In the control condition, the
phycoerythrin content decreased.
Discussion
High guano exposure does produce quantifiable dif¬
ferences in algae growth as demonstrated by the data.
Shacklock, et al. (1975) have shown that carrageenan
production is inversely related to the amount of available
