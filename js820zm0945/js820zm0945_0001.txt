Effects of Guano

Abstract
Gigartina papillata (Rhodophyta) cultured in high con-
centrations of NO, NH, and guano for 10 days showed the
same changes in R-phycoerythrin for all three conditions.
G. papillata from an area with high guano exposure off China
Point on the Monterey Peninsula showed significantly (p.01)
more phycoerythrin and significantly (pc.05) less carrageenan
than control sites with little guano exposure. G. papillata
was also shown to be significantly (p£.01) thicker in distal
branches than in control sites. Endocladia muricata (Rhodophyta)
and G. papillata from high guano density areas were shown
significantly (p£.01) shorter and had significantly (p.01)
less branching than did the same species in control sites.
