Materials and Methods
The study site consisted of a group of rocks approxÂ¬
imately fifty meters off China Point on the Monterey Penin-
sula (see figure 1.) At the time of the study, these rocks
supported a large population of seagulls, approximately
twenty cormorants, two oyster catchers, and a few transient
pelicans. All sampling within the study site was done
along a 20 meter transect, running parallel to the coast-
line, on the protected side of Bird Rock. The control sites
with relatively little guano exposure consisted of areas
1 and 2 in figure 1.
Random numbers were generated corresponding to a
20 meter transect and at each point samples of algae were
obtained from the control site and from the study site.
Samples were taken from approximately three feet above the
mean lower tide level. Length is the distance between the
frond origin at the holdfast to the tip. Branching is
the number of branch points radiating from the stipe.
Thickness for G. papillata only, was determined by measur-
ing the mid portion, with a micrometer, of the most distal
branch of the holdfast origin.
R-phycoerythrin was extracted from G. papillata
samples in 6 ml. of .025 Tris-HCl per .4 g. ground dry
algae sample. Each sample was extracted for four hours
at five degrees after which maximum absorption at 565 nm.
