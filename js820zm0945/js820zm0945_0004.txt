Effects of Guano

Total carrageenan content was determined by a method
recommended by E. L. McCandless in personal communication
and modified by Huskins (personal communication). The algae
used were male or sterile G. papillata from the study site and
from the control sites. Each sample was dried, ground in a
ball mill, and then weighed portions of about 1.5 g. were added
to 200 ml. of distilled water with 5 ml. of 2% NaOH.
After extraction at 80-90 degrees centigrade for 18 to
22 hours, the samples were filtered with celite and the fil¬
trate was added to 2.5 times its volume of isopropyl alcho¬
hol to precipitate the carrageenans which were subsequently
filtered, dried and weighed.
Guano and non-guano G. papillata were cultured in various
concentrations NH,, NO., PO, and guano. Refer to table 1.
Solutions were changed every three days and were under constant
aeriation and were grown outside in constant day/night cycles.
The temperature was kept constant in a constantly circulating
seawater bath. A portion of the plant was used to est-
ablish initial phycoerythrin levels. Ten days later at the
termination of the experiment final absorption was determined.
Results
Figures 2A and 2B show the differences in length and
the amount of branching between the study site and control
site 2 in E. muricata and G. papillata. Using the student's
t-test, the guano plants were found to be significantly
(pc.01) shorter and have significantly (p£01) less branching.
