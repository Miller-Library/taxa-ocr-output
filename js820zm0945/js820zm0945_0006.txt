nitrogen. In the presence of nitrogen, proteins are prefer¬
entially produced. As the nitrogen levels drop, protein
production is suppressed and the excess carbons are stored in
the form of such polysacharrides as carregeenans. The low
levels of carregeenan in the guano area algae indicates
that there has been nitrogen enrichment.
Phycorythrin is a protein bound accesory photopigment
primarily responsible for the color of red algae (Abbott, Hol¬
lenberg 1976). The high phycoerythrin in plants near guano
(see figure 3B) was sufficient to make them obviously darker
in color. Pigment concentration increases with increasing
nitrogen levels (Eocha 1965); the high levels of this pig-
ment in the study site relative to the control site indicate
a high nitrogen concentration.
There were deviations from what was expected. Study site
plants when grown in guano and NH, decreased in pigment content
instead of staying the same or increasing; appreciable increases
did not occur in control site algae grown in NH,, NO, or guano.
These discrepancies could be attributed to a nitrogen defficiency
in all conditions and particularily in the ambient and
phosphate situations. Or more concievably, the environment
in an erlenmeyer flask is not ideal for optimal growth.
There is a positive correlation between the amount
of carrageenan and the ability to resist desiccation (Huskins
1979). If carrageenan is instrumental in preventing desic¬
cation in the high intertidal zone of the study site, G. papil-
lata containing small amounts of carrageenan would seem to be
maladapted for survival.
