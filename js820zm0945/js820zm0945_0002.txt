Effects of Guano
Page 3
Introduction
In coastal waters, there are various types of con¬
centrated sites of animal waste of which several examples
are seal and sea lion rookeries, human sewage outfalls and
guano deposits produced by birds. Algal marine communities
effected by seal excrement has been investigated (Hanson,
Judy 1971: Hanson, John 1972). Although the bulk of most
research is on sewage effluent produced by humans, there
has been some mention in the literature on the effect of
shore bird guano. Guano has been implicated in enhancing
the production of phytoplankton as well as enhancing the
production of fish (Wheeler 1945). But on the whole,
there have been no systematic attempts to détermine what
the consequences of this excretory product are. Questions
such as does this nitrogen and phosphorous rich compound produce
a favorable environment for local organisms? or does this
substance act more as a pollutant than as a nutrient? or
are there no effects at all? have never been adequately
answered.
In this paper, I discuss the differences in Gigartina
papillata and Endocladia muricata between areas with intense
guano exposure and guano free areas and I present experimental
evidence which implicates guano as a factor in causing
some of these differences.
