fornia. All are intertidal species except B. tintinnabulum which lives
continually submerged. Published accounts of larval development in these
species are lacking. It was the purpose of the present study to raise
larvae of each of the species and to describe successive instars suffi¬
ciently to permit identification of each naupliar stage of each species.
Past attempts at in vitro larval cultivation have met with varying degrees of
success. Herz (1933) found eight naupliar stages and one cyprid stage in
in vitro culture of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus crenatus : Exact'>Balanus crenatus.</span> Bassindale (1936) reared <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Verruca : Exact'>Verruca</span>

also.
For this study <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. glandula</span> was collected on intertidal rocks and
B. tintinnabulum from the underside of an offshore float near the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California.
polymerus and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dalli</span> were obtained at Yankee Point, South of
Carmel, California. Mature ovigerous lamellae were removed from the
mantle cavity and placed in fingerbowls containing millipore filtered
seawater. The nauplii that hatched swam immediately toward the lighted
end of the fingerbowl where they were collected in a Pasteur pipette
and transferred to another fingerbowl of millipore filtered sea-
water. This fingerbowl contained <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Platymonas : Exact'>Platymonas</span> sp., a flagellate known
to provide a diet on which a våriety of barnacle larvae survive and
grow (Okamoto, 1967). Platymonas was obtained from the Hopkins Marine
Station culture collection. The larvae were cultured at room temp¬
erature (21-23° C). Three to four times daily, samples of each barnacle
species were removed and examined under a compound mocroscope. A few
additional specimens were examined from cultures of nauplii raised on
Platymonas by E. Okamoto at the Hopkins Marine Station.
Three characters which proved most useful in distinguishing
species and instars were antennule setation (Newman, 1965), body
shape, and tail morphology. Two lesser features that proved useful were
the appearance of a separate carapace at stage IV (see Crisp, 1961) in
three of the species examined, and the appearance of a compound eye in
C. dalli in stage Vl. Antennae and mandibular setation were helpful in
identifying certain instars of particular species. Äfter identification
of a particular stage, drawings were made with the aid of a camera luc¬
22

ida. Length measurements were obtained by measuring from the anterior
end to the tip of the tail; in stages IV-VI length from the anterior
tip of the carapace to posterior end was also measured. Set tion of
the appendages was recorded according to the method of Newman (1965).
It was possible to obtain naupliar instars I-IV in B. glandula and
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. polymerus,</span> and to raise C. dalli to thé cypris stage. B..tintinn-
abulum survived only through the third naupliar stage. The results
of the study appear in Figures 1-9 and Tables 1-4. The species studied
show differences in size and body shape, between species and also
between different stages in the same species (Fig. 1, Tables 1-4).
The setation of the antennule proved most useful in separating stages
I-V in C. dalli and at least stages I-IV of the other species (Figs.
1-4, 6-9 ). However, since setation of the antennule was the same for
of species
comparable stages of all four barnacles, identification is dependent
on tail morphology and body shape (Figs. 1, 5 ). Notable features
of the stages of the species studied are discussed below.
Stage I
Size proved to be the only distinguishing feature between the four
species. (Fig. 1, Tables 1-l).
Stage II
At this stage each species attains a characteristic shape (Fig. 1).
C. dalli is shaped much like a heart whose anterior portion is flattened.
The frontolateral horns project at right angles to the body and the
carapace does not yet appear as a separate entity. The body tapers to
a sharp point posteriorly. The tail ends in a prong-like process;
proximally it bears two sharp lateral spines (Fig. 5).
ee
John B. Snodgrass -1
B. glandula has a shield shape with its frontolateral horns
upturned and projecting at approximately 15° from the body; the tail
is long and slender and also ends in a pronged process (Fig. 5).
P. polymerus is shaped like a wine goblet and its frontolateral
horns project at right angles from the body. The tail is much like
that of B. glandula except that it bears small, spiny projections (Fig.
5).
B. tintinnabulum is characterized by its large size, second only
to B. glandula, a rounded body, ahd frontolateral horns which resemble
cattle horns in their positioning. (Fig. 5).
Stage III
In all species this stage'is larger than the preceding one. A new
process appears on the dorsal side of the antennule, immediately prox-
imalto the distal group of four setae. (Figs. 2-4). This was noted
in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. hameri</span> (Crisp, 1961) and in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. nubilis</span> (Barnes, 1959). The tails
increase in size and become jointed above the end prongs in all four
species (Fig. 5 ).
Stage IV
At this stage in B. glandula, P. polymerus, and C. dalli the
carapace becomes markedly differentiated from the main body (Fig. 1).
Also a new process appears on the antennule to make a total of two
which are located proximal to the terminal four (Figs. 2-4, 6-9 ).
As shown in Figure 5 the tails are very characteristic for each species.
These features plus an increase in size make the fourth instar easily
distinguishable from the preceding three.
2
John B. Snodgrass 5
Stage V
In <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dalli there</span> is an increase in size over stage IV and
another seta appears on the dorsal side of the antennule, bringing
the number in the proximal group to three (Fig. 6).
Stage V
The transitions from stage V to stage VI involve no change in
number of setae on the antennule, and size is the simplest, though
not always definite, criterion for distinguishing between the two
stages. Compound eyes have been reported as occurring in the late
stage VI larvae by Costlow and Bookhout (1957). While develop¬
ment of the compound eyes was not followed in C. dalli, larvae of the
same size, both with and without compound eyes, were observed; both
are here classified as stage VI (Fig. 1).
The <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cypris : Exact'>Cypris</span> Darva
The cypris of C. dalli (Fig. 1 ) was raised in culture and was
observed to settle.
SUNMARY
B. glandula and P. polymerus were raised in vitro from hatching
to the fourth instar nauplius and C. dalli from hatching to settlement
of the cypris. B. tintinnabulum was raised through stage III. Cultures
were maintained at room temperature and fed on a diet of Platymonas sp.
Larval size, shape, and details of the tail and appendages are presented
for all species and all stages observed. Definite differences between
instars, and between species at the same instar, permit identification
of species and stage of development. Setation formulae, particularly
of the antennule, though of limited value for distinguishing different
22
John B. Snodgrass - 6
species, proved good indicators of specific instars. Body shape and
tail morphology provide the most useful characteristics for species
recognition.
