Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
Introduction
The comatose condition as observed in Tigriopus californicus
is one in which non-responsive body movement is observed following
exposure to stress. The potential to recover to the active state
separates coma from death.
The ability of T. californicus to withstand in laboratory studies
salinities in excess of 190%0 (Issel,1914) was confirmed by Egloff in
his studies of a natural tide pool in which T. californicus were
observed to be inactive subsequent to an increase in the pool's
salinity over 44 days from 43 %o to 200 % (Egloff, 1966). After an
additional 12 days in salinities in excess of 300 %the animals showed
recovery within two weeks after being placed in normal seawater.
Work on the copepod Tigriopus fulvus indicated that the time
required for recovery in normal seawater was proportional to the
hypertonicity of the affecting solution (Ranade, 1957).
Studies on the effect of evaporation and the effect of increasing
salinities prompted Patterson to suggest that T. californicus was
capable of osmoregulation. However, this has not been confirmed.
Patterson also described swarming and clumping behavior in T. californicu
in salinities exceeding 200% seawater with loss of activity in 300%
seawater (Patterson, 1967).
Evaporation with resultant salinity increases is a common
occurrence in high tide pools. Variation in salinities is an import
ant variable in the environment of T. californicus.
There have been few studies of the adaptation of T. californicus
to gradual increases in salinities. Rates of salinity changes,
specific salinities and time considerations relative to the comatose
