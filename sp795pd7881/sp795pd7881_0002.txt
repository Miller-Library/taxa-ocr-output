Abstract
The susceptibility of Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912)
from the coast of Central California to high salinities was studied
using evaporation and hypersaline solutions. The EDgo for coma
occurring during 2 days of evaporation was 144 %. with a 95% confi¬
dence interval of less than + .003. The EDgo., for three different
rates of salinity increase produced by the addition of hypersaline
solutions were 132.2, 145.2, and 154.5 % with fpp:g of 1.02, 1.01
and 1.01 with 100% coma occurring at 10, 40, and 70 hours respect¬
ively. Fifty percent of the animals became inactive but not comatose
at a salinity of 93.3 %0 with a 95% confidence range of 97.97 to
88.86 %0 during a 2 day period of evaporation. Females with egg
sacs appear to be more resistant than the general population.
