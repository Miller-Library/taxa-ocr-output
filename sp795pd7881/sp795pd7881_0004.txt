Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
and recovery states are key subjects which have yet to be examined.
Differences in population density and sex ratio have been noted in
the field (Nimkin, 1977). The effect of salinity changes with
respect to population size and structure is an interesting subject
for study as well. Past work has only superficially explored the
physical and behavioral characteristics of T. californicus in coma
and recovery.
This study is an attempt to further elucidate the effect of
hypersaline conditions on T. californicus and utilize both evaporaÂ¬
tion and solutions of high salinity as a means of producing gradually
increasing salinities.
