Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
densities seem to participate in the grouping behavior.
Figure 8 again using three different population densities
illustrates that at low density coma is conspicuous at lower
salinities than is observed with medium or high population densities.
These differences diminish as the salinity is increased.
A comparison of the susceptibility to coma of females with egg
sacs and a mixed population is presented in Figure 9. The EDgo for
coma in females with egg sacs is 148.25 %o salinity with an frp.
1.004. The EDgo for the mixed population is 144.05 % with a fyp-a
of 1.04. Similarly, in the mixed population the females of copula¬
ting pairs appeared to be somewhat more resistant.
Although ability to recover upon return to normal salinity was
used to differentiate between coma and death, the occurrence of a
90° dorsal retroflexion of the tail before or after return to normal
salinity appeared to be related to an inability to completely recover.
