Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
Discussion
This study has explored the ability of T. californicus to
withstand high salinities produced by evaporation or the addition
of hypersaline solutions. The observed changes from active to
inactive, to coma and death have improved the characterization of
these animals' response to this stress. The relationship between
high tolerance to high salinities and the rate of salinity increase
is compatible with Patterson's hypothesis of osmoregulation (Patterson,
1968), however, a real demonstration of an osmoregulating ability
requires an analysis of the body fluids of the animal.
High tide pools in the field undergo slow changes in salinity
from evaporation, therefore, populations of T. californicus would
be faced with gradual salinity changes over a period of time and
appear to be quite tolerant of such slow increases in salinity.
Egloff's study with long term adaptation of T. californicus to rising
salinity in a natural tide pool suggests that some animals showed
activity in salinities near 200 % (Egloff, 1966). In the present
study 150 % was found as an extreme upper limit for activity in
short time acclimatization. The rate of increase of salinity is
crucial in determining the salinities at which coma occurs and
from which recovery is possible. Percent recovery can be elevated
through slower rates of salinity increases. Most natural tide pools
of significance to T. californicus contain greater volumes of seaÂ¬
water than this study used in evaporation experiments and even longer
time would be available for acclimitization under natural conditions,
The mechanisms involved in adaptation to slow salinity increases
remains to be explored.
