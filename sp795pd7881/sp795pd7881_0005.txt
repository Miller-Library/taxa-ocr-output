Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
Materials and Methods
T. californicus were collected from high tide pools with
salinities of 35-45 %.at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California.
Salinities were measured in the field using an American Optical
Refractometer.
Studies on the effect of evaporation were conducted in 8.9cm
diameter petri dishes. Evaporation was studied at 20 C with or
without the aid of a fan.
Studies on the effect of elevated salinities utilized solutions
prepared from Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Inc., Eastlake,
Ohio). These studies were carried out in a volume of 20 ml in
14Â½ x 1 3/4cm test tubes.
Fifty percent effect doses for activity, coma, and death were
obtained using an approximate probit analysis (Litchfield and
Wilcoxon, 1949). 953 confidence limits for the EDgo are obtained
as the product and quotient of the EDgo and its fyp..
