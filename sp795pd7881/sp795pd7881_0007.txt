Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
less pronounced when 15ml and 25ml volumes are compared. The
EDgoeg for the 3 different rates of salinity increase from starting
volumes of 5, 15, and 25mls were 132.2, 145.2 and 154.5%respectively
and the fepgoes
for the 3 rates were 1.02,1.01 and 1.01 respectively.
In Figure 5 ability to recover as a function of time after
100% of the population was in coma is presented. Ability to recover
was determined by returning thesalinity to approximately the starting
condition of 35 %0 by the addition of distilled water. The results
indicate that the slower the rate of salinity increase due to
evaporation the greater the percent recovery. However, the longer
the animals remained in coma the smaller the percent recovery,
Populations of T. californicus can be divided into three segments
based on their response to increasing salinity due to evaporation.
See Figure 6. As salinity increases the percent of free swimming
animals declines. Many of the inactive animals can, however, be
prompted into activity through physical stimulation. There exists
a range of salinities between 125 % and 135 % where all the animals
are quiescent but can be prompted into movement. Beyond this range
coma becomes conspicuous. The EDgo for inactivity was 93.3 % with
a 95% confidence range of 97.97 to 88.86 %0. Physical stimulation
by stirring leads to only very temporary activity.
As salinity is increased through evaporation T. californicus
tends to group together in lose aggregations. The salinity at which
this curious phenomena can be observed is dependent upon the population
density.
Figure 7 shows that high population density leads to aggregation
at a lower salinity than is observed with intermediate or low populaÂ¬
tion densities. A greater percent of the animals at high and medium
