Figure 5. Histogram of the percent of animals recovering from
coma vs. time after 100% of the animals became comatose.
Ability
to recover was tested by returning the salinity to approximately
35 %. Open bars represent results from evaporation of an initial
volume of 5ml, and linedbars represent preparations from evaporation
of an initial volume of 15ml and solid bars represent preparations
from evaporation of an initial volume of 25ml of 35 % sea water.
