Tolerance of T. californicus to High Salinities
Results
In the examination of salinities resultant to evaporation at
which coma could be observed 20 petri dishes each containing 10
T. californicus of both sexes were placed in 10ml volumes of 35 %0
sea water. Figure 1 shows the result of this experiment. The 50%
effect dose, EDg, was found to be 144 %owith a 95% confidence
interval of less than +.003.
Figure 2 shows percent of animals in coma and death resulting
from exposure to increases in salinity produced by the addition of
hypersaline solutions. The figure shows that not only do percent
in coma and death increase with increasing salinity but percent
death exceeds percent in coma after reaching a salinity of 175 %
Some T. californicus can survive gradual increases in salinity to
175 %oand remain active in 140 %.
The difference between death and coma was determined by returning
the animals to a salinity of 35 %0. Death became the dominant
effect when a salinity of 175 %owas reached.
When the salinity was increased more slowly over a two day
period even greater adjustment by the animals is indicated as shown
in Figure 3. An even greater percent of the animals showed an ability
to recover at 175 %0.
Figure 4 shows the effect of the rate of salinity increase
produced by evaporation. Animals were placed in 5, 15, and 25ml's
of 35 %sea water and salinity increased at different rates due to
the differences in the effect of evaporation. A faster rate of
salinity increase from the smallest volume resulted in a higher
percent coma at lower salinities. This affect, however, seems to be
