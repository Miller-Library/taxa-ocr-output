presence of morphologically similar species that remain cryptic because differences are
visually imperceptible. This would also critically alter our knowledge of distribution
patterns. Both taxonomic and sampling improvements have the potential to shift this
distribution to the right.
CONCLUSION
This study meshes two older fields of biology, taxonomy and biogeography, with
the emerging field of macroecology to provide a snapshot picture' of what we know
about a very specific faunal groupâ€” those organisms found on Davidson Seamount.
However, because seamount biology is in its infancy, some sacrifice of "the apparent
precision and analytical elegance of ecologists" (Jackson et al. 2001) is necessary.
Combining datasets from different researchers will allow us to answer fundamental
questions within the field that would be difficult, if not impossible to do otherwise. As
sampling increases, we can expect these ranges to expand as more information becomes
known.
This study demonstrates that most of the megafaunal community of Davidson
Seamount has been found at least a thousand kilometers away. This information can be
used to reevaluate the role of seamounts in conservation. Protecting a single seamount
with the expectation that this will encompass the entire geographic range of many novel
species is not a valid conservation strategy because it is based on speculation. My study is
the most comprehensive among a growing body of knowledge that is demonstrating that
few organisms are localized to this scale. Instead conservation proposals should
emphasize the high number of species representing a wide continuum of geographic
ranges that are concentrated within a relatively small area on seamounts.
