FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1 A topographic map showing the geographic location of Davidson Seamount. Depth
isomers and transect locations from ROV dives are overlaid. The inset shows Davidson's
position relative to the California coast.
Fig. 2a The frequency distribution of published maximal linear distances in kilometers
(km) for Davidson Seamount fauna. The orange dotted line at 1879 km indicates the
median value for this dataset.
Fig. 2b Transformation of the frequency distribution of published maximal linear
distances into a probability distribution. This figure plots the percentage of species found
on Davidson Seamount with a range less than the x-axis value. Lines representing the
approximate location from Davidson Seamount of select localities have been overlaid.
Fig. 3 Boxplots of the maximally published linear distances (in kilometers) by phylum for
each phylum found on Davidson seamount. The lines of the boxplot represent the first
quartile, the median, and the third quartile. The whiskers were calculated by multiplying
the difference between the third and first quartiles by 1.5.
