ABSTRACT
Seamounts are topographic features that extend upwards a thousand meters
or more from the ocean floor, but peak below the water's surface. Initial studies of
seamount biota proposed a high level of endemicity on seamounts. However,
further work has called this assumption into question. For the first time, global
biogeographic ranges have been gathered for a marine assemblage, namely that of
107
the Davidson Seamount (-35.7Â° N, 1ZZ.
W). Only five percent of Davidson
fauna are localized to this seamount, with the majority observed over a continuum
of geographic ranges. As further evidence against the endemicity hypothesis,
eighty percent of the megafauna have been found over a thousand kilometers away
from Davidson Seamount. Moreover, taxonomic and sampling improvements have
the potential to increase this figure, which suggests that most deep-sea
assemblages are composed of widely distributed species.
