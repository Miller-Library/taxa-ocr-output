ABSTRACT
Rhodoglossum affine (Rhodophyta) is a midintertidal alga
of the Pacific Coast; its position is +0.5 to +4.5 ft. tidal
level. The most abundant life phase is male plus sterile,
occurring higher than females in the same region. Tetrasporangial
plants are sparse, possibly due to the season. Morphological
measurements were taken which show plants higher inposition have
shorter fronds with larger holdfast area containing more fronds
per holdfast than lower zoned plants. Stress tolerances of
Rhodoglossum were examined noting thephysiological changes of
the plants in relation to vertical height and exposure. Higher
level plants tolerated increased temperatures with greater
survival than lower plants. Desiccation effects of Rhodoglossum
were studied as afuntion of net photosynthetic rates. More
exposed plants have higher rates after 1 and 5 hours of drying
compared to calmer sites. Higher level plants exhibit a
recovery of photosynthesis after 3 hoursof desiccation.
INTRODUCTION
The environmental conditions of the high intertidal zone
appear to be harsh for the algae inhabiting those positions.
One alga, Rhodoglossum affine (Harv.)Kyl. occupies a specific
location in the Pacific intertidal (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976),
approximately +0.5 - +2.5 ft. above MLLW according to Smith (1944).
In this study, the zone was extended to +4.5 ft. What makes
possible the occupancy of this location and how are the plants
affected? This paper examines Rhodoglossum to determine its
zonation, distribution, abundance and ability to withstand
desiccation and temperature stress in terms of tidal height.
Both morphological and physiological variations were studied.
1) FIELD STUDIES
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The first part of the project was to determine the
distribution and abundance of the life phases of Rhodoglossum affine
in the midintertidal region. Samples were taken to observe the
structure of the algal community at different sites. Three areas
were chosen with varying degrees of wave exposure: 1) a small
pocket beach at Third Street, Pacific Grove, 2) northwest rocks
of Mussel Point, and 3) west rocks of Pt. Alones (Fig. 1). At
each site a transect was run perpendicular to the coast; along
each line Rhodoglossum clumps were selected at different heights.
Each site consisted of three levels: high (3.8 ft.), middle (2.8 ft.)
and low (2.3 ft.); above 0.0 ft. tide level. The sampling
technique was to place a 20 cmx 20 cm quadrat with 10 rows of
dots at each tidal height, in four separate locations within one
meter to either side of the transect line. These areas were not
chosen randomly, but picked for their concentration of R. affine.
Within each quadrat the algae percent cover of Rhodoglossum was
measured and the life stage, number of fronds per holdfast, and
the size and length of individual fronds were noted. Cross-
sections were made of several fronds from each clump at the base,
mid and top areas to determine cortex and medulla thicknesses.
RESULTS
The abundance of Rhodoglossum affine plants was largest at
the middle exposure site (site #2 ), although the alga was present
in considerable number at all locations. In terms of the
distribution of life phases, there was always a greater number
of male and sterile plants than female plants (Fig. 2). The
females were found lower down within each area, below the male
plants. Very few tetrasporangial plants were found, and they
were always in the lower zone. The female Rhodoglossum plants
were longer and more branched than the males with smaller
holdfasts containing fewer fronds. The percentage of total plant
area which was holdfast is largest at high levels and decreases
with lowering height (Fig. 3), while the number of fronds per
holdfast increases from low to high (Fig. 4). The length of
the fronds is greatest at lower levels (Fig. 5). The data from
the cross-sections of the fronds show that the only significant
difference in the thicknesses of medulla and cortex between zones
is at the base of the frond. The width of the base decreases with
lower tidal heights. Other thicknesses do not vary with specific
heights or sites.
DISCUSSION
At all sites examined, the morphology of Rhodoglossum affine
can be defined for higher and lower regions. The higher occurring
plants have greater number of, but shorter, fronds with a greater
holdfast area per total plant area. The higher level plants are
more uniform in shape and resemble a turf. At lower heights, the
fronds are longer, but there are fewer fronds per holdfast.
The
bases of the plants, just above the holdfast, are thinnest at
lower tidal heights and increase in thickness with vertical
height in the zone.
The distribution of various life history stages show that
during spring in these areas, few tetrasporangial plants are
present. The male plus sterile plants are most abundant and were
found higher than the females within each region. The highest
percentage of males to females was at the most exposed site
(site #1), while the highest percentage of females occurred at
the calmest site (site #3). The males tend to be shorter and
less branched than the females.
At this time of year, more males are present, suggesting
timing differences in life history, or natural dominance or
fertilization is less effective. The females are larger and
longer to accommodate the carpospores which cover their thallus
surface. Perhaps female plants have narrow tolerance ranges;
further studies would need to be done to identify site selection
factors.
2) LAB STUDIES
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimentation was done to determine desiccation (percent
weight loss) of Rhodoglossum affine over time. Vegetative fronds
from all nine locations were collected at a low tide and kept in
running sea water for 12 hours before initiation of the experiment.
Individual fronds were weighed; then dried at room temperature (+22'c).
At 1-hour intervals, the fronds were reweighed then reemersed
until a constant level of weight loss was attained.
Temperature stress experiments were performed in which
vegetative fronds of similar size (collected at low tide from
all zones) were placed in beakers of sea water, in a large water
bath. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes.
then the bath temperature was increased or decreased. At 5°c
intervals, several fronds were placed back in running sea water.
Death was determined by loss of pigmentation. Observations of
survival were made for 2 weeks, allowing time for the temperature
effects to be visible in the algae.
Desiccation experiments were designed to reflect a correlation
to photosynthetic rate. The algae were again collected at low
tide from the three sites, taking the entire plant including
holdfast. These plants were kept in a tank of running sea water
until the time of experimentation. Only undamaged, vegetative
fronds of the R. affine plants were used. The experiments were
run at the same time every day to avoid the possible effects of
a circadian rhythm of photosynthesis (Harris, 1978). The rates
of net photosynthesis were determined using a Gilson pressure
constant differential respirometer with a 195,Emes bulb. This
procedure has been documented by Umbreit (1972). The side arm
contained 1 ml of standard bicarbonate buffer solution to keep
CO» at normal levels throughout the duration of each run (Pratt, 1943)
The temperature was set at 12°0. The algae were weighed, dried
in 22°C air to the appropriate level of desiccation and then
placed in the vessels. There were 3 - 6 replicates for every run.
The flasks were equilibrated 30 minutes prior to each run; readings
were taken every 20 minutes for 200 minutes. The data were recorded
svelved
as follows: 102 g (wet weight) : time.
RESULTS
The Rhodoglossum affine from all locations dried at
approximately the same rate, reaching a maximum weight loss of
60-70% of original weight after five hours of exposure to
air. The algae from site f3, the calmest locale, dried
faster than the other sites, and lost the most water(75%),
whereas the fronds from site +2 lost only 65% of the original
weight. (Fig. 6)
The R. affine from every level survived temperatures up
to 35°C, but at 40°C all were bleached, thecriterion for death.
The results show that of the plants highest in position, only
the tips bleached, whereas in plants of lower positions up
to 75% of the thalli were bleached. At 45°C all of the plants
experienced total death. Atlow temperatures (from 22°0 to 0°C
during a 45 min. run), samples from all areas survived. Even
after 60 minutes at 0°0, no damage to the fronds was observed
(Fig. 7).
In long term desiccation experiments the algae were dried
at room temperature for 55 hours with no detrimental effects;
all of the fronds rehydrated andsurvived when placed in sea
water. In repeated desiccation tesis, Rhodoglossum could be
desiccated 3-5 times for up to 8 hours andstill recover its
ability to imbibe water.
In each run of the respirometer, algae from the same
site (from high andlow levels) were run together in order to
get a comparative measurement. Runs were made using fronds which
had been desiccated for between one and three hours. According
to L. Hodgson (personal communication) after 3-5 hours
photosynthetic rates begin to drop to zero and no further
rates can be properly measured. Results of one and five hours
Of desiccation show that plants form more exposed sites have
higher rates of photosynthesis. At 3 hours, all plants show
a decrease in photosynthetic activity. After 5 hours of
drying, the plants higher in vertical zonation show a period
of recovery and increase their rates, while low plants continue
to decrease their photosynthetic rates. (Fig. 8 & 9) The
calculations for these rates were analyzed using an average
weight of a frond for each zone, and figured out for net
photosynthetic rates in1 0 evolved : gram wet weight : hour.
DISCUSSION
The Rhodoglossum affine fronds undergo a rapid loss in
weight during a desiccation period; an average loss of 50% of
wet weight after 2-3.5 hours andaa maximum weight loss at
five hoursof 60-75%. The levels seem uniform with an average
loss of 68% after five hours. In the natural environment,
thevarious levels have different exposure times for a tidal
cycle; ranging for 23 hours per cycle to 7 hours per cycle.
All of the fronds were re-emersed in sea water at the conclusion
of the experiment (55 hours); they all rehydrated and
appeared to survive, showing a broad tolerance to desiccation
stress, more than ever encountered during normal weather
conditions. It would be interesting to repeat this test with
the added varibles of windbrheat, which would better assimilate
natural conditions and possibly lower the survival rate.
In the temperature stress experiment, R. affine showed
remarkable tolerance; all levels had the ability to withstand
a temperature range of 0 C to 35 C without damaging effects.
Rhodoglossum is well-adapted to its position in theintertidal;
tolerating any climatic temperature range. At the high
temperature of 40°0, the fronds all showed somesigns of death,
with the higher zoned plants surviving better. These would
be the plants which undergo the longest amount of exposure during
a tidal cycle; it is advantagous to be able to endure extremes
of stress. Good evidence of the adaptation of Rhodoglossum
affine to the intertidal region is its ability to tolerate
desiccation and recover with rewetting. Tidal exposure is
therefore not hazardous to the population.
In the desiccation  photosynthesis experiments, the
distinction between theamount of exposure was more significant
than thedistinction between tidal heights. After 1 and 5 hours
of drying the Rhodoglossum plants of the more exposed sites
had a higher photosynthetic rate. After 3 hours of desiccation
all plants showed a decrease in rate. Higher zoned plants
recovered at five hours and increased their photosynthetic
activity; the lower plants remained at a lower level of
photosynthesis.
The reasons for a higher ratefor the more exposed sites
may have to do with numerous environmental parameters. The
more exposed plants face more stressful conditions and this
may reflect in their rates of photosynthesis. The higher
zoned plants recover after 5 hours of drying and increase
their photosynthetic rates. Thisecoùld be due to an environmental
cue. The algae need some amount of desiccation to enhance
their photosyntetic abilities. (Gessner & Schramm) According
to Doty (1946) zonation can be attributed to the ability of
thealga to tolerate the stress of exposure; this could also
be true within the Rhodoglossum species. The high andlow level
plants slow their rates after 3 hours of drying, but increased
desiccation may signal the higher plants of a zone to speed up
their rates of photosynthesis. The higher plants are often
exposed to lengthy periods in air and must be able to regulate
their activity during desiccation. The lower zoned plants
spend less time in theair; they haveadapted an energy efficent
system of lowering their rates during short desiccation times,
and not respond to tidal cues in the same manner as the
higher plants.
CONCLUSIONS
The structure of the Rhodoglossum affine population varies
with relation to the tidal height of the region. Higher zoned
plants have shorter and more numerous fronds with larger
holdfast areas; thelower plants tend to be long and thin with
fewer fronds per holdfast. The thickness of the fronds changes
with vertical height, but only with respect to thethickness
of the cortex in the basal section. The higher placed plants
have a thicker cortex than low plants. The higher plants as a
clump have more surface area and thicker fronds to withstand
wave shock; shorter fronds would also help in storing water and
protecting against desiccation.
The distribution of Rhodoglossum affine was found to be
correlated with tidal height. Thenumber ofmale plus sterile
plants was greater than the number of females; with the
largest number of females located beneath the male andsterile
plants in each region. Tetrasporangial plants were sparse at
the sampling sites, possibly dueto a seasonal fluctuation.
When found, they were located in lower levels. Female
plants were generally longer and thinner the themale plants
10
with more branching and fewer fronds per holdfast.
In a population of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Rhodoglossum : PartialExact'>Rhodoglossum there</span> are also physiolog-
ical differences. Some variations are between plants of
several tidal heights. The response to heat stress shows this;
higher placed plants can withstand higher temperatures and
survive. Also, higher level plants can recover after five
hours of desiccation and have an increased rate of photo-
synthesis when compared to lower plants of thesame zone.
Some distinctions between Rhodoglossum occur between
sites, a factor affected by wave exposure. Plants from site f3
a calmer zone dried out faster and had a greater weight loss
than the other, rougher zones. The Rhodoglossum of the more
exposed sites had a higher photosynthetic rate after desiccation
than the calmer site plants.
