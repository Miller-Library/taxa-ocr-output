applying pressure with a pair of bent forceps. Gland contents normally had a final volume
of about 4 ul. The contents of the gland were then suspended in 293 external solution and
placed in an Eppendorf tube to a final volume of 0.5 ml at a dilution of approximately
1:125. The solution containing venom was then centrifuged two times for approximately 25
seconds in an Eppendorf centrifuge model 5415 C at 13,000 rmp. The supernate was
decanted and heated for 5 minutes at 100 °C to denature any active enzymes, and then
placed in a 4 °C cooler for storage.
Cells
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were purchased from ATTC, Rockville,
MD, and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100
U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells for transfection were grown to 75%
confluency and split 1:50 one day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmid
vectors containing various K channel cDNAs using the calcium phosphate transfection
methods of Chen and Okayama (1987).
Electrophysiological Recording
Conventional whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed with the HEK
293 cells. External 293 solution contained 20 mM KCl, 180 mM NaCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 5
mM MgCI2, 10 HEPES, 1 mM EDTA with a pH of 7.2 (adjusted with NaOH). Currents
were recorded at room temperature using a whole-cell voltage clamp amplifier and a
lowpass filter set at 15 KHz. Electrode resistance was 1.0 to 1.8 MQ when filled with an
internal solution containing 60 mM KF, 140 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCI2, 8 mM EGTA, and
10 mM HEPES for a pH of 7.3 (390 mOsm).
All currents were compensated for linear capacitive and ionic currents using a
standard P/4 subtraction protocol. Voltage commands were generated using
VCLAMP/WCDATA software and a direct memory access (DMA) interface. Data
