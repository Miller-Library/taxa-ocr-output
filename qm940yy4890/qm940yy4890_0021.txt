Acknowledgements
1 would like to thank Professor Gilly and Mat Brock for helping make this project a
successful and enjoyable endeavor. Jon Sack, Joseph Schultz and Henry Jerng deserve
much credit for their tolerance of my questions and occupation of their time and space in the
lab. Thanks also to Jim Watanabe and Joe Tyburzcy for collecting the snails and making
the project possible. Spring quarter â€™99 was without a doubt the most enjoyable experience
Thave had at Stanford and this is entirely due to the awesome personalities and abilities of
everybody in the Gilly lab.
