B) Ig evoked from depolarizations in the same cell. First, TEA is applied
concurrently with toxin and a slight decrease in time constant of inactivation and
depression of Ig is seen in comparison to the TEA-only sweep. Next, only venom
is perfused in (no TEA). After TEA is washed out the effects of the venom are
established immediately, with a large decrease in time constant of inactivation and
large increase in fraction of channels blocked from peak Iy to steady-state Iy
C Another TEA competition experiment at 740-ms depolarizations to +20 mV.
Here, venom is first added to the solution to produce the fast inactivation and
increased block effect as in B. Next, TEA is added with toxin and the competition
effect is again seen. TEA acts to slow down (decrease) the time constant of
inactivation, and shows a decrease in the fraction of channels blocked.
Figure 5: Inhibition of venom-block by external TEA. The fraction of steady-state Iy was
decreased at all voltages by external TEA.
Figure 6: Competition model for TEA and venom. The solid line predicts a 1:1 competition
between two agonists for a blocking site at the channel. Two separate experiments
in which TEA and venom were applied simultaneously show some deviation from
the 1:1 blocking competition. This is calculated by the equation 1-(T/Tyan) ys.
1-(LEAyenon) from-20 mV to +20 mV in each experiment (one of the voltage steps
could not be accounted for in the solid circle experiment).
Figure 7: Recovery of Ig from Conus venom block is slow and dependent upon holding
potential. Recovery of peak current is shown using a double pulse protocol as
described in Horrigan and Gilly (1996). Currents evoked by test pulses after 250
ms recovery intervals at -120 and -80 mV demonstrate that recovery of Iy from
venom block is accelerated at more hyperpolarized holding potentials.
