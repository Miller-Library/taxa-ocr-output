action was preserved following dialysis of the venom at a 3500-molecular weight cut off.
This suggests a large molecule such as a peptide is the active component.
Introduction
Cone snail venoms
Peptidic components of the venoms of predatory Conus species have been used in
previous studies to characterize external regions of ion channels because of the great
affinity and specificity they show for binding sites. Many of these conopeptides target
voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels, as well as the acetylcholine receptor. In this
study, voltage gated Shaker K channels were shown to be affected by some component of
the raw venom of Conus californicus in a way that has not been previously described. An
active component in this venom, suspected to be a peptide, acts to induce fast inactivation
of Shaker K' channels in a way that is similar to open-channel block that is demonstrated
by many quaternary ammonium (QA) and tertiary amine compounds.
However, unlike known open-channel blockers, the Conus venom component
shows no accelerated recovery from block in solutions with high external K' concentration.
Another inconsistency of the venom with known open channel blockers is the fact that
venom effects are inhibited by the presence of external TEA, suggesting an interaction in
the external region similar to that seen in k-conotoxins (Olivera et al. 1998), which target
voltage-gated Kâ€œ channels as well. All other open channel blockers acting to cause rapid
inactivation in K' channels act on the internal region of the channel.
Methods
Preparation of venom
Venom was collected by removing the entire venom gland and its attached muscular
bulb from the snail. The gland was then put on a glass plate and the contents exuded by
