acquisition and analysis were performed with the same program. Holding potential was -80
mV throughout all experiments. Recordings were made at room temperature (20-22Â°C).
Application of venom
The setup for HEK 293 recording included an Air Cadet vacuum/pressure station
(Cole-Parmer Instrument) to allow exchange of the external solution. A volume of 0.5 to
1.5 ml of the experimental solution was perfused into the chamber with this system while
aspirating the overflow.
Results
Conus californicus venom component acts as an open channel blocker of Iy
Control Ig (Fig. IA) was evoked in response to a 740-ms depolarization to +20 mV
and represents maximal activation of K' conductance. At each venom concentration. Iy
begins to activate normally in response to depolarization but then becomes blocked in a
time-dependent manner, declining exponentially to a steady state at full concentration that
shows inactivation of 85% of channels.
In Figure 1B the concentration dependence of the venom effect is seen in which
greater venom concentrations produce a faster time constant of inactivation and the amount
of steady-state block is increased. Figure 2 shows that steady-state block is independent of
voltage at all concentrations tested.
The blocking behavior produced appears to be similar to others described by a
simple model of open-channel block, such as that seen in the QA tetrapentylammonium
(TPeA) as developed by Armstrong (1971), that assumes no block at rest. Steady state I in
Conus venom represents an equilibrium between open and blocked channels with an
equilibrium constant Kd = (L/K) where k and L represent the rates of drug block and
dissociation from the open channel and k is proportional to the venom concentration.
