In the present study, it was assumed that if Conus venom and TEA were applied
concurrently in the external solution, then an inhibitory effect of TEA on the action of
venom would be indicative of competitive interaction between the two agents at the outer
mouth of the channel.
90 mM TEA added to the external solution (in the absence of venom) has the effect
of blocking approximately 60% of steady state Ig (Fig 4A). When venom is added and TEA
has been washed out, there is a decrease in the time constant of inactivation to 44 ms. and
an increase the fraction of blocked channels to about 85% of control (Fig 4B), as would be
expected when the competing agonist has been removed.
Now it is necessary to compare channels exposed to venom only to those exposed
to venom and TEA simultaneously. When channels are exposed to a solution containing
both venom and TEA, the results show both a increase in time constant of inactivation from
the amount that is seen in venom without TEA to around 100 ms (Fig. 4B, 40), as well as
Ã  25% decrease in the fraction of channels blocked from maximum Ig to steady-state (Fig.
5).
This interaction between external TEA and the venom suggest an external binding
site for the venom component. In a model that assumes 1:1 competition between two
blocking molecules (Choi et al. 1991), two separate experiments reasonable agreement with
the 1:1 competition hypothesis (Fig. 6).
Recovery from venom component block is slow and independent of external
K concentration
Recovery of 1g from block in the presence of Conus venom was tested using a
double pulse procedure as described by Horrigan and Gilly (1996). Recovery from venom
component block was found to be faster at more negative potentials (Fig. 7). This follows
the expected model for recovery in which larger inward Ig acts to remove open channel
blockers from their internally bound position (Armstrong, 1971).
