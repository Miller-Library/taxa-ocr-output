Using the same recovery procedure it was found that at high external Kt
concentrations, the rate of recovery from block was not substantially affected (Fig, 8).
Larger inward lg does not relieve block, which does not agree with the expected model for
recovery from block in K' channels.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that a component of the venom of Conus californicus
blocks Ig in Shaker B channels. The mechanism of this block was shown to involve a
direct interaction of the venom component with K' channels in a time-dependent manner
that is well described by the model of open channel block developed by Armstrong (1971)
to describe the effects of quaternary ammonium ions (QA). However, unlike the QA open¬
channel blocker model in which the blocker crosses the membrane and binds to the internal
region, the Conus venom component appears to bind externally.
Consistent with the theory that the Conus venom is acting externally are the
apparent interaction of external tetraethylammonium (TEA) and the venom component, and
the independence of recovery from block from changes in external K.
Based on a competition model established for TEA and an intrinsic open channel c-
type inactivator of Shaker channels, it seems competition exists between the Conus venom
component and external TEA. If the full effect of the toxin were seen in the presence of
external TEA, it would be assumed that the venom component was acting on the internal
region of the channel. However, in the presence of external TEA, the venom was unable to
exert its full effect of both the rate of inactivation and the degree of steady-state block of
channels.
Although recovery was found to be voltage dependent in the way described for
öther open channel blockers, experiments performed in which recovery was tested at O. 20.
100 and 200 K showed no significant acceleration of recovery at higher K' concentrations.
The results from the high external K' experiment are inconsistent with models shown for
