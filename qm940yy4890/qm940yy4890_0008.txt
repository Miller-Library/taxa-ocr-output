internally bound open-channel blockers in which the blocking compound is destabilized
and kicked out of its position of blocking the pore region by increased inward Iy.
A test was needed to determine if a externally-bound protein was indeed the active
component in Conus venom. For this experiment, dialysis tubing with a 3500-molecular
weight cut off was used. Here, a sample of 0.5 ml (toxin + 293 external) was dialyzed for
26 hours with solution changes of 1 liter approximately every two hours, 13 in distilled
water and a final two times in 293 external solution. If the active component was a
traditional open channel blocker such as a QA or tertiary amine of low m.w. then these
compounds should have been dialyzed out of the sample. However, large compounds such
as conopeptides would be retained. Following the dialysis, the sample showed the full
effect of a non-dialyzed toxin sample on the Shaker B channels. A large conopeptide would
be expected to bind externally to the channel, as it would be unable to cross the cell
membrane.
Together, these results support a hypothesis in which a conopeptide is the active
component in Conus californicus venom. More tests must be run in order to firmly
establish the conclusion that a peptide is working in the external region of the channel, but
if this holds true, then perhaps a new class of conotoxins could be identified. A conotoxin
agonist working from the external region of the pore to produce an effect like open-channel
block would indeed be novel among the conotoxins documented thus far.
