Figure 1: Basic venom effect. Externally applied Conus venom causes time-dependent
block of Shaker B K' channels.
A) Ig evoked by 250-ms depolarizations to -10 mV in the absence (control) and
presence of venom.
B) Ig at +20 mV in the presence of the indicated relative concentrations of Conus
venom. Control record (0.0 venom concentration) was obtained immediately before
application of the venom at 0.1 dilution. Traces were recorded after envenomation
in sequential order of increasing relative concentration.
Figure 2: Voltage-dependence of steady-state block of Ig by Conus venom. Calculated by
taking 1 minus the steady state current at the end of a 740-ms pulse over the peak
current (1-L) versus voltage. As relative venom concentration rises from 0.1
to 1.0, the fraction of blocked channels increases. A mild, U-shaped voltageÂ¬
dependence exists for all venom concentrations and is also evident in the control
condition.
Figure 3: Concentration-dependence of steady state Iy block. Mean fraction of steady state
block was calculated from data between -20 mV and +20 mV at each of the three
relative concentrations of venom. These three values are compared with a 1:1
binding isotherm fitted to the data points by eye.
Figure 4: External TEA (90 mM) reduces the effects of Conus venom.
A) Depolarizations to +20 mV in control solution and following application of 90
mM TEA in which Ig is reduced by 55% and inactivation of channels is blocked.
