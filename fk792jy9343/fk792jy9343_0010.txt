In areas I, II, III, the same relationships were obser¬
ved with respect to wave action and high water level, as were
made for the total beach. Since areas I and II are on simi¬
lar locations on the beach, the consistently lower figures
for area I may be interpreted as a result of I's greater
slope. As change in slope is related to wind and wave action,
as well as high water level, its pattern of flux is often paral¬
lel to that of the drift. The graphs of these two similar
areas however, indicate to me that the greater the slope,
the lesser the amount of drift remaining (Figure 11).
Summary
Increased wave action is the principal cause of arrivals
of large quantities of drift on the sandy beach. As the high
water level decreases so does the amount of drift left on the
beach. Composition of drift on the total beach area is
difficult to assess; it was observed however, that the
asses were larger following
quantities of Rhodophytes and surf
a period of increased wave action. Thus what arrives on the
beach is also related to wind and water movements. Compo-
tion of the dri
t appears constant enough and sufficently
airly uniform percentage of organic matter
mixed to yield a:
potentially available, although some portions of the dri
such as Phaeophytes may contribute more organic material
àn other groups. Quantity available and rate of decay fluc-
tuate greatly, however, and appear to be lim
greal con¬
tribution. The slope of the beach changes because of shifting
sand, itself a result of wind wave action and high water level
