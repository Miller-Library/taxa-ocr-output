Methods and Materials
To estimate the changes in quantity of drift on the
beach a photographic method was employed. Two pictures.
a north view and a southe view, were taked each day at the
low tide. Information from these pictures was then trans-
ferred to graph papper, with the aid of a plastic overlay.
which corrected for the foreshortening of the Ploaroid camera.
The overlay grid was made be staking out the beach at 2-meter
itervals from east to west, and photo
phing the beach while
staked out at low tide. C.
tical stakes were left in so that
the picture could be aligned under the overlay each day.
Figures from the dia
ams made from the pictures, as well as
depth measurements made with a meter stick, were used to estimate
the wet volume of the beach each day.
In order to es
mate what the dry weight of the total drift
of each day was, a wet volume/dry weight conversion factor was
determined. Every day a packed 1/4 cubic meter of we drift
would be sampled, wet weighed, dried 24 hours at 60Â°0, and dry
weighed. This number was then used to make a total beach dry
mate by multiplying the conversion factor times the total
beach wet volume.
Three areas along the beach were selected to measure more
carefully the quantity of drift arriving. Each was twenty feet
long and five feet wide. Area I was furthest south, and area II
lirty feet north of it, with similar exposure. Area III was
located on the northern end of the beach. The table indicates
some initial measurements but these varied over the period, toble
some extent. (Table 1.)
