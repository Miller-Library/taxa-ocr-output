Observations were made to determine changes in quantity,
class composition by bulk, potential organic input from
drift, and the quantity of dri
arriving on three specific
areas of the beach. Both this study and ZoBell's concur
ft deposited on the beach is
(i) that
the quantity of dr
related to the amount of off-shore growth, and to water
and wind movements as indicated by wave heig
ts; (ii)
that residence time of depositions of drift is a factor of
the high water levels which follow it; and (iii) that
slope of the beach chal
nges with large depositions of sand
(also linked to wind and water movements), and this affects
the quant
ties of drift remaining on the beach.
The beach studied has a west north west exposure, and
is flanked by rocks north and south. It was approximately
75 meters by 20 meters at the beginning of the study.
