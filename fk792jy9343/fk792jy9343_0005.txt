Each day, at the lowest tide of the day, the north
half of each area was cleared of drift. The sampling was
done by hand as raking accumulates too much sand. Each
area's sample was placed in a marked plastic bag, to be
weighed later. At this time the temperature, wind, wave
heights, and sunlight observations, were made for the day.
Pieces of drift greater than 15 centimeters were removed
from the south half of each marked area, and tagged with
colored, numbered, plastic tape, and replaced on the area.
Every two days the slopes of the marked areas was measured.
The bagged samples were wet weighed using a spring ba-
lance and then subtracting the weight of the tared plastic
bag. The samples were dried in aluminium foil baking dishes
for 24 hours at 60Â°, and then dry weighed using a spring
balance.
To determine the relative percentage composition, bby
class, of the drift arriving on these areas, prior to
drying each sample was sorted on quadrated paper, into
Rhodophyta, Phaeophyta, Chlorophyta, and surf grasses.
Bulk percentage composition was determined in this way, for
each sample. The Rhodophytes were principally Gigartina
era, and Gigart
californica, while the Phaeo-
corymbi
phytes consisted mainly of Macrocystis. Chlorophytes were
not very prevalent and were comprised of various Ulva.
The surf grass was Phyllospadix

described by Doty (1967). The modification of the method
