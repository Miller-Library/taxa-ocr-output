9. The dry weights and slopes for two similar areas
on the beach were compared (Figure 11). The greater the
slope of a beach area, the lesser the drift remaining.
Disoussion
There are both rhythmic and causal factors involved
in the total quantity of drift on the beach. The causal
factor is a large deposition of drift on the beach, (Figure
6) which appears to be the result of wind waves the day pre-
vious to the deposition. The increased wave action is re-
moving algae and grasses from the sub-tidal and inter-
tidal regions of the cove. The greater the tidal out-sweep.
the less drift left on the beach, (Figure 7). A longer study
would be necessary to defi
nitely determine this but the
3m
prelimi
y data indicate this trend.
The rhythmic factor enters into the results in the
form of the high water level preceding the sampling. As
the tides decrease so does the total dry weight of the drift
on the beach. Thisp
pattern is observed on the total beach
(Figure 6) following each large deposition of dris
ft, and
is also demonstrated in the specific three areas, (Figure 8).
In the specific areas, however, there would appear to be some
m
exceptions to this but upon closer examil
nation these occur
when the tide and waves are high enough to wash up over the
area, depositing drift above the marked areas as on May 14,
