April 26, start of project.
May 1, a large deposition of drift arrives.
May 3, removal of some drift; larger quantities
moved to southern end of beach.
May 10, drift at the south end is being buried
and removed.
May 16, beach is clear again of major piles of
drift.
otal beach dry weight estimates were made using
a wet volume/dry weight conversion factor. Conver-
sion factor was made for each day as it was de-
pendent upon wave height and tidal level.

Specific areas I,I,lil, had dry weight increases
concurrent with the total amount of drift on the
beach.
