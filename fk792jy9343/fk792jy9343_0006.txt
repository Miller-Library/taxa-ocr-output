was that a packed volume of .02 cubic meter of each sample
was treated, instead of the whole sample, and this
numÂ¬
ber was used as a factor to estimate the potential
organic
input. This technique was also used to determine a treated
dry weight/dry weight percentage, for each class,
(Figure 9).
Doty's method was selected rather than an ashing
technique
because it allowed treatment of a larger number of samples.
and because of experimental difficulties with the muffle
furnace used in ashing.
