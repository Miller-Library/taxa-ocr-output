The quantity of drift algae on a sandy beach is
constantly fluctuating. Residence time for the majority
the drift is brief, in that only about ten per cent
remains long enough to completely decompose, but while
remains it provides a major source of food and shelter
for organisms on the otherwise barren sandy beach.
ZoBell (1971) did a twelve year study on the dri
seaweed on San Diego County beaches, and made biweekly
inspections at low tides on forty-nine beaches. Estimates
were made of the quantity and major species compo
tion of
large depositions found on these beaches. My study.
in order to est
mate the poten
lal organic matter conÂ¬
tributed by the drift on a sandy beach, attempts a
closer observation of similar factors in a 5-week period.
