or when the high water level is not high enough to have
reached the marked areas since the last sampling, as on
May 4, 5. 6, 7, and 8, in area III, and May 21, 22, 23, on
all areas.
The wind waves are also affecting the class composi-
tion by bulk, with a marked increase in relative amounts of
Rhodophyta and surf grass the day following stronger wave
action. They are being torn from the rocks in the cove by
the higher ene
y wave action, (Figure 10). It would be
difficult to make any further generalizations about the
make up of the drift due to sampling error.
The potential organic contribution results (Figure 9)
show that certain classes of drift contain more organic
matter than others. However the fact that the ratio of
treated dry organic ma
tter to dry weightr
ns fairly
constant, varying only.07 would indicate that the composiÂ¬
tion of the drift does not fluctuate enough to drastically
ffect the potential organic input, over the period studied.
What does fluctuate, of course, is the total quar
ity of
drift on the beach, and this must have the greatest impact
on the organisms living there. Although the figures for
organic matter tell us something, they do not indicate the
organic contribution being made directly to the beach.
In order to dete:
ne this one would have to consider the
ten per cent of the dri
t which remains long enough to be
he relative rates of
broken down completely, as well as
razing
decay of various classes due to bacterial decay and,
by larger organisms.
