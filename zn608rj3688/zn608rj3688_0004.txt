membrane proteins themselves (Lancet, 1986). Both approaches might
benefit from a large pool of sensory cells, such as occurs in fish.
The shortage of work on fish with these newer techniques is even more
surprising in light of the great commercial importance of these
animals.
We have initiated studies designed to develop a model experimental
system for examination of transduction mechanisms in olfactory receptor
cell of a fish. The present paper describes several aspects of the
anatomy and physiology of the olfactory organ and nerve in Sebastes,
genus of Scorpionidae rockfish common in the North Pacific. The
particular advantages of study on this animal include the ready access
to the organ and nerve, the easy dissociation of single receptor cells,
and the large number of species available for comparative purposes.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Isolation of Olfactory Organ and Nerve
We examined three species of Sebastes rockfish: chrysomelus
(black and yellow), atrovirens (kelp), and caurinus (copper). All
fish were caught with barbless hooks baited with squid in the
intertidal zone of the Monterey Bay. They ranged in length from 20 to
25 cm. Fish were kept for up to two weeks in a tank with circulating
natural sea water at ambient sea water temperature (13-15 C), and
sustained with regular feeding.
Individual fish were killed by rapid decapitation, and one eye was
removed to expose the olfactory nerve, which runs along the inside of
the orbit. The olfactory nerve was then severed where it entered the
skull and separated from surrounding connective tissue. We enlarged
