ABSTRACT
Work on olfaction in fish is significant in two major ways.
First, characterization of effective attractants obviously would impact
on commercial fishing. Second, examining basic olfactory mechanisms in
fish could further our general understanding of sensory mechanisms in
vertebrates. We examined the olfactory system in three abundant
rockfish of the Sebastes genus in order to initiate such a program of
research. We discovered extremely slow conduction velocities of in the
olfactory nerve of 15 to 25 cm/sec, and extremely small axons, even
compared to other fish. Our studies raise questions about the
organization of these axons in the olfactory nerve. Finally, tissue
dissociation proved effective in isolating single receptor cells in
high yield. Future research on olfaction in Sebastes rockfish looks
very promising.
