INTRODUCTION
Herman Kleerekoper (1969), in his extensive review of olfaction in
fish, remarked, that "the olfactory organ is the most primitive among
the sensory receptors." Yet, we do not understand the mechanisms
involved in olfaction. Such events as receptor-stimulant interaction.
neural processing and recognition of odors remain unsolved puzzles and
great possibilities exist for significant future research.
Olfaction in fish has historically been a useful system with
which to address these questions because the sense of smell is highly
developed in these animals. For example, certain species can detect
alanine and other substances at extremely low concentrations (Hara,
1975). Migratory salmon find identify home stream by the "scent" of
small concentrations of chemicals (Ueda, cited in Bardach and Villars,
1974). We can infer the importance of olfaction for fish simply from
observing the extremely large size of the olfactory organ in relation
to that of the brain, and the tremendous number of receptor cells (up
to 10 million; Doving, cited in Kleerekoper, 1969).
Despite the historical interest in fish olfaction from a
behavioral point of view and the large number of readily accessible
receptor cells, the organ in fish has received comparatively little
attention in studies focusing on transduction mechanisms in single
receptor cells. Current research techniques of particular importance
are being applied in the study of olfactory receptor cells of other
species. Patch clamp recording enables visualization of membrane
currents mediated by receptor and channel proteins (Nakamura and Gold,
1987). Biochemical and molecular research analyzes properties of the
