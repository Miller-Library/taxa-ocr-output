inter-electrode distances of 0.4 and 0.8 cm. Shocks: 45V at 0.4 cm,
45-60 V at 0.8 cm with duration of 0.4 msec. Bottom: Three spikes
represent distances of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 cm. Shock: 65V at all three
positions with O.4 msec duration.
Figure 7. Identification of cells dissociated from olfactory
epithelium based on drawings by Holl (cited in Bardach-Villars). a)
Original drawing by Holl. b-g) All pictures of cells dissociated with
Protease, except for e) which came from "natural" dissociation. All
cells were seen under inverted compound microscope at 600x. b)two
apparent types of receptor cells; c)elongate receptor cell; d)"cigar-
shaped" receptor cell; e)ciliated cell; f) ciliated cell with cilia
removed; g)goblet cell.
