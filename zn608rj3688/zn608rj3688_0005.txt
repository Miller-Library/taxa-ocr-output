the naris, freed the olfactory organ from the pigmented tissue which
held it in place in the nasal cavity, and then teased out the entire
organ and intra-orbital section of nerve through the enlarged naris.
The nerve is easily damaged during this procedure at the site where it
passes through the ocular bone which separates the nasal cavity from
the eye socket. If the extraction of organ and nerve is carried out
carefully, with a minimum of lateral pulling and without squeezing the
nerve in the forceps, the preparation obtained shows no difference in
characteristics of nerve transmission compared to those observed with
in situ preparations.
All experiments were carried out in a saline solution designed for
Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus) by Gilly (1987): 200 NaCl, 4
Cacl , 4MgCl, 3KCl, 10 Hepes (mmol/1), buffered to 7.2 with NaOH.
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
We fixed pieces of nerve and rosette in 28 glutaraldehyde in fish
saline for two hours, then washed in clean saline and postfixed in 2%
OsO in artificial sea water for one hour. Osmolarity of the
glutaraldehyde was adjusted to approximate that of the fish saline by
dilution with deionized water. After dehydration in graded ethanol.
tissue was embedded in LR White. Sections approximately 0.15 microns
thick (silver-gold) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and viewed at an accelerating voltage of 60kV in a Phillips 201
electron microscope.
Recording Action Currents in Nerve
The method of extracellular recording is described in Gilly, Yee
