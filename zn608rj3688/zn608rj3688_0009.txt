of two representations: two distinct peaks would appear at different
thresholds, as depicted in Figure 5, or a "shoulder" would arise in the
depolarizing phase of the spike, as can be seen in Figure 6. These
phenomena suggest that more than one class of axon may exist.
Conduction velocities measured ranged from 15 to 25 cm/sec. The
variation occurred from nerve to nerve, and velocities did not depend
on distance the stimulating and recording electrode. Figure 6a shows
two records from the same nerve for inter-electrode distances of O.4
and 0.8 cm. Figure 6b shows three records from the same nerye at
distances of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 cm. The conduction velocity is measured
in each response as approximately 15 cm/sec. Increasing interÂ¬
electrode distance did cause a widening of the recorded signal, and a
slower rise to peak voltage (Figure 6).
Isolation of single sensory cells
Several cell types are visible in the material dissociated from
the sensory epithelium, as documented in Figure 7. The yield of
receptor cells from this procedure was excellent, although the protease
seemed to remove the long sensory cilia which are expected to be
associated with sensory receptors (Kleerekoper, 1969). In an attempt
to visualize ciliated sensory cells, we also observed cells shaken from
"naturally" dissociated tissue. The yield from this method was much
lower, and most of the sensory cells seen had broken off from the
tissue in the company of support cells and were not easily visualized.
Between the two methods, several specific cell types could be found
which appear to correspond well to those depicted in the schematic
drawing at the top of Figure 7 (taken from Bardach and Villars, 1974).
Basal cells did not appear in the dissociated material in any number.
