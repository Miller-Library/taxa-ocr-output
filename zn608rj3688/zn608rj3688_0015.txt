Figure 1. Drawing of olfactory organ as viewed from front and back.
From back of rosette, branching of major bundles into filaments is
apparent. Major bundles, fila olfactoria,
pigmented tissue
and orientation is labeled.
Figure 2. Cross section of Sebastes chrysomelus olfactory nerve.
10,000x. Scale: 1 micron. Schwann cell nucleus (Nu.), Schwann cell
ensheathing processes (Pr), and axons (ax.) are labelled. Shrinkage of
tissue in preparation is apparent by amount of plastic (white areas) in
picture.
Figure 3. Histogram representing distribution of axon sizes as
measured from Figure 2.
Figure 4. Typical bi-phasic, graded action current in olfactory nerve
of Sebastes atrovirens, as observed with extracellular recording.
Shocks: 20, 40, 60, 80 & 100 V with 0.4 msec duration. Interelectrode
distance: O.6 cm.
Figure 5. Responses showing two peaks. Top: Larger, faster axons
(first peak) have lower threshold while smaller axons are recruited at
greater shock strength. Shocks: 10-50V with 1Omsec (long) duration.
Inter-electrode distance: 1.2 cm. Bottom: Recruitment of fibers now
reversed. Smaller axons (second peak) show lower threshold. Shocks:
10-40 V with 0.4 msec duration. Inter-electrode distance: 0.6 cm.
Figure 6. Effect of changing inter-electrode distance on response.
Both pictures are from the same preparation. Notice appearance of
"shoulder" consistently on all spikes. Top: Two spikes represent
