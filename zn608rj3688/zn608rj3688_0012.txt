Figure 5. The faster, larger axons making the first spike should be
the first to depolarize, exhibiting a lower threshold, as seen in the
top trace. However, in the bottom trace, the smaller axons involved in
creating the slower spike show a lower threshold. However, we propose
this phenomena to be the result of placing the stimulating electrode
closer to a region enriched in smaller axons. The more distant
regions containing the larger axons would thus be excited only at
higher voltages. Whether the differentiation of bundles of fibers has
a specific purpose is a question which will require much future
investigation.
Unfortunately, attempts to electrically stimulate the sensory face
of the epithelium yielded no interpretable results. More careful
mapping and recording from smaller nerve bundles might yield positive
results. Recording from nerve while applying chemical stimulants to
the sensory epithelium is technically feasible with this organ, but our
limited attempts at chemical stimulation do not warrant serious
discussion.
Dissociation of single putative sensory cells from the olfactory
epithelium was very successful. The simple methods used and the
resultant high yield make it seem likely that additional technical
refinements would produce even better results. It definitely appears
that single cell recording techniques such as patch clamp should work
well for studying olfaction in fish. Furthermore, the ready access to
the large olfactory organ in rockfish and the success we had with
dissociation methods prompts us to suggest use of these rockfish for
future biochemical and molecular research on the olfactory system.
Using fish as models for olfactory research shows great promise,
not only in relation to fisheries biology and commercial fishing, but
