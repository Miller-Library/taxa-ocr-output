small lamellae lie at the most anterior end, and significantly larger
ones at the posterior end of the nasal cavity (Figure ja). This
anatomy agrees with that described for similar fishes by Kleerekoper
(1969).
Observation of a living rosette under a compound microscope (40x
water immersion objective) revealed motile cilia on the "top" edge of
each lamella (i.e., the edge facing the inhalant naris). Beating of
these cilia propelled fluid down each surface of the lamella towards
the center of the rosette and outwards between the lamellae. What
appeared to be receptor cells were visible on the lower half of the
flat sides of the lamellae. Whether those cells were restricted to
these areas could not be determined.
The olfactory nerve extracted with the rosette measured up to 3 cm
in length. The whole nerve consists of about 8 major bundles, each
with numerous subdivisions (Figure 1b). The tissue sheath on each
individual bundle does not bind to that surrounding adjacent bundles.
Thus, for when we cut the sheath wrapping the whole nerve, the separate
bundles would fall apart. This made it feasible to obtain a single
bundle of axons (several hundred thousand axons) several om in length.
thereby permitting stimulation and recording of action currents in a
specific group of axons. Although the dissection becomes more
difficult, each major bundle can be further "de-sheathed" to expose a
number of minor bundles or filaments, referred to collectively as "fila
olfactoria" by Kleerekoper (1969). Recording can also be done from
these smaller filaments.
Each major bundle seems to innervate one specific region of the
rosette, most likely a wedge of several lamellae. Where the major
bundles approach the bottom of the rosette, distinct branching occurs,
