as depicted in Figure 1b. In some instances, one of these smaller
filaments or fila could be traced into a single lamella.
Transmission Electron Microsopy
Observations of the olfactory nerve in cross section (Figure 2)
reveal the fine structure of the axonal bundles. A Schwann cell
nucleus is visible and varying numbers of tiny axons are ensheathed by
the processes sent out by such Schwann cells. The number of Schwann
cells and their exact three-dimensional disposition could not be
determined in our observations. Each Schwann cell must ensheath
thousands of small axons, however, and the average axonal diameter is
approximately 0.05 microns (histogram, Figure 3). The extensive
shrinkage seen in the preparation makes accurate diameter estimation
impossible.
Use of the electron microscope to view epithelium will be
discussed in conjunction with the results on isolation of single cells.
Electrophysiolgy
Extracellular recordings of olfactory nerve activity were made
with a suction electrode, applied either en passant or to the cut end
of the nerve. Following a brief electric shock applied to the nerve,
we observed a bi-phasic, graded spike typical of compound activity from
a large number of axons with similar properties. (Figure 4).
Conduction velocity was very slow, as would be expected for nonÂ¬
myellinated axons of such small diameter (see below). Increasing shock
strengths showed that the greater recruitment of axons at higher
voltage did not appreciably change the time course of the response.
However, in many instances, shocks near threshold did reveal a dramatic
change in time course. This change in time course could assume either
