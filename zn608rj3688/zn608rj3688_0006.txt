and Burkhardt (1986). Glass suction electrodes ranged in diameter
from O.5mm to O.1mm, and we obtained best recordings when the nerve
precisely filled the tip of the suction electrode, thereby creating a
fairly tight seal. The stimulating electrode consisted of two Pt-Ir
wires (70 um diameter) separated by 150 um and insulated by a thin film
of silicone glue.
We calculated conduction velocities by dividing inter-electrode
distance by the time lapse between the onset of the shock artifact and
an estimate of median height of the depolarizing action current on a
storage oscilloscope. Uncertainty in determining the median height of
the first spike leads to an estimated maximum error of 10% in the
conduction velocities.
Isolation of Single Cells
Pieces of a rosette consisting of 4-5 lamellae were dissected
manually and placed in normal saline containing 5 mg/ml Protease XIV
(Sigma) for 50 minutes. The pieces of tissue were then washed in clean
saline and immediately examined under an inverted compound microscope
(4Ox objective). We also found that "natural" cell dissociation took
place when slices of the rosette were simply left in saline at room
temperature for two hours. In both cases, we dispersed cells from the
lamellae by gently shaking the tissue manually.
RESULTS
Examination of Olfactory Organ and Nerve
The rosettes removed from adult rockfish of 20-25 cm length filled
the nasal cavity underneath the incurrent and excurrent nostrils. The
rosette is slightly elliptical in shape, with 20-24 lamellae. Very
