series of tests, more urea was present (average,25.47) than in
the first tidal cycle (average 22.137). The ammonia-N content
was also increased from 33.34% to 41.7%. Here, as in the first
run, uric acid was present in only trace amounts, except at
irregular times, at LLW, when it amounted to as much as 3.13%.
Generally those snails from higher in the intertidal showed
a greater variation in total NPN at any one time in a tidal cycle
than the lower snails tested simultaneously. From Figure 3
it can be observed that snails in higher areas did not show the
low NPN at LLW that snails from lower areas did. On the contrary,
NPN was at its lowest at HHW and immediately after LHW, the only
periods in the cycle when these snails received water directly
in the form of splash. At LHW a wide range of NPN was seen,
2.83-6.36 mg/ gm. of kidney. This could be the result of the
lower snails collected having been splashed but the higher ones
remaining dry. Ammonia did not show quite the same correspondence
with NPN as it did in the lower areas. There seemed to be less
drastic decreases. The most noticeable one occurred at mid-LHW-LLW.
This corresponded to the drop in NPN evidenced at the same time.
There was a rise after HHW and also a peak at LLW. Overall, the
percentage of ammonia-N in NPN was less, 24.927, and showed less
variation than that of ammonia-N found in snails in lower in the
intertidal (33.34%) Urea, as in the lower areas, corresponded
to the ammonia, always remaining less and falling quite a bit
at HHW. Again uric acid was found in negligible amounts.
The second series of testin the high area involved only
a small part of the tidal cycle, so little can be said about
the total picture. Two interesting observations can be made,
