system of the snail with the onset of the summer tides, warmer
weather, and more nutrient growth. This suggestion implies that
urea and undetermined-N are products, either terminal or
intermediate, of the same pathway. Further investigations to
determine what these unknown materials are, as well as studies
of this correlation with urea, could prove interesting. Such
analyses might reveal the pathway by which urea is formed.
In the second abbreviated series of tests on snails from
high in the intertidal, uric acid was found to be in vast quantities
at irregular intervals in the tidal cycle. With each increase
in uric acid there was a simultaneous decrease in urea, and vice
versa. Although urea varied at other times when only trace amounts
of uric acid were found, this inverse relationship might prove
interesting for further study. Perhaps uric acid and urea are
a part of the same metabolic pathway.
The problem of uric acid production is an interesting one.
Needham (1935), in proof of his hypothesis that limited access to
water results in an increase in the formation of uric acid,
presents definite ranges of concentrations of uric acid for the
four species he tested. Littorina rudis is located a little
below L. planaxis in the intertidal and it contained 5.1 mg uric
acid/ gram dry kidney weight. If the data obtained in the present
study is calculated in the above manner, the largest figure for
L. planaxis is 3.5 mg uric acid/ gm wet kidney weight; this
large amount was found in L. planaxis only once in the tidal
cycle, with smaller amounts occurring at other times but only
sporadically. Certainly these quantities were not constant, in
contrast to Needham's findings. It is suggested, therefore, that
