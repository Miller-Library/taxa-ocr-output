however: uric acid appeared in large quantities fro the first
time in the course of this investigation; up to 20.97 of the NPN
at mid-LHW-LLW consisted of this waste product. Simultaneous
with this sudden increase in uric acid, urea and ammonia decreased
and subsequently rose again when uric acid nitrogen fell.
DISCUSSION
In general it can be stated that there was variation in
NPN as well as constituent products in the kidney of Littorina
planaxis within a tidal cycle. Needham's assumption, an important
basis for his analysis, that the kidney retains the renal waste
products for very long periods did not seem to hold for the snails
studied here.
More specifically, kidneys of snails located at the lower
limits of the species' distribution showed an interesting
anomaly at LLW. One might have expected a greater amount of NPN
at that time than others,because there was no water available
for diffusion of urea and ammonia into the environment; however,
the contrary was seen to occur. The amount of ammonia-N averaged
2.25 mg/gm of kidney at this time, whereas an average of all the
other measurements was 3.54 mg/gm of kidney. If this is correlated
with the fact that the ammonia-N percentage at LLW, 9-197, was
very much lower than that normally found, 33.34%, it might be
hypothesized that ammonia is being eliminated as a gas. Or,
because ammonia is toxic and requires much water for elimination,
perhaps less ammonia is produced by the snail at this time in the
tidal cycle. At any rate, all snails tested seemed to be exhibitig
the same tendency toward very low NPN and ammonia at this time.
Not including the LLN percentages, it would seem that the
