of waste is continually diffusing into the water available to
the lower snail, but those in the higher regions have no water
for this elimination. This difference in NPN might also be due
to the ease of obtaining kidney free of other tissues in the
larger snails from the high area. This separation is more
difficult in the smaller snails from lower in the intertidal.
This other tissue contains no NPN but contributes to the weight
of the sample.
Along with the greater amounts of NPN there seemed to be
less ammonia-N (24.927) in snails from the higher areas. Perhaps,
because ammonia is more toxic than other waste products and reÂ¬
quires more water for excretion, a snail exposed to air for 957
of the time can't tolerate such high percentages of ammonia as
snails in the lower, wetter areas (33.347). The one time,LLW,
when the lower snail was exposed to an environment similar to
that of the higher snails there was a remarkable decrease in
ammonia-N.
A large percentage of undetermined -N was found in the
first series of tests, 63.587, and much less two and one-half
weeks later, 45.76%. This same decrease in undetermined-N was
found in snails from the lower regions, with 46.717 in the first
cycle and 31.06% in the second. Perhaps, this observation could
be correlated with the finding that urea was in much smaller
quantities in the first run, 11.07%, than in the second,21.87.
When added together, ureatundetermined-N =- 74.65% NPN in the
first series and 67.56% in the second. These percentages seem
to be very similar. The "equation" does not hold for snails
in the lower regions. Perhaps, a change has taken place in the
