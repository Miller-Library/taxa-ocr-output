average percentage of ammonia-N, 33.34%, in this littorine
corresponds to the 39.9% given by Spitzer (1937) for L.littorea,
a snail occurring lower in the intertidal. Only three ammonia
measurements were over Spitzer's maximum of 50%.
Concerning the other constituents of NPN in the low areas,
it seems that less urea than ammonia was found in the kidneys,
except at LLW. This latter observation could be a result of
the fact that urea had no way of leaving as a gas (as ammonia might),
so it contiued to be stored in the kidney until enough water
was available for elimination by diffusion. The average, as
compared to Sptizer's figure of 12.6% was 22.13%. This
increased slightly to 25.4% in the second tidal cycle. As for
the very low uric acid content in the snails low in the intertidal,
it might be argued that since these L. plandis are around water
90% of the time, they have no need of utilizing a water con-
servation mechanism; the uric acid present might merely represent
the degradation of nucleic acids. However, the second series of
analyses showed slightly greater amounts of uric acid being
produced at irregular intervals. This at least indicates a
capability of synthesizing uric acid from ammonia.
Snails from the upper extremes in the intertidal also
showed variation in kidney contents with tidal changes. These
results seem to be more easily explained: urea and ammonia
diffuse into the water when it is available to the snail, at
LHW and HHW; in the interim, there is storage of the products
and gradual increase, with one drop at HL, which is perhaps due
to ammonia gas elimination. It would appear that there was more
NPN/gm of kidney in snails from the higher location than in
those found lower. It is possible that a certain minimal amount
