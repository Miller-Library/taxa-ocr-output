Few studies have been made of the nitrogen waste products
of the littorines. Spitzer in 1937 (see Fretter and Graham, 1962)
studied the nitrogenous excretory products of Littorina littorea,
a gastropod located in the low intertidal of Europe. Needham
(1935) studied the uric acid content of four species of littorines,
but did not analyze the kidney for other waste products. The
purpose of this investigation, therefore, was to obtain data
on the total non-protein nitrogen, NPN, and the various nitrogenous
constituents of the kidney of Littorina planaxis, a gastropod
with wide vertical distribution in the intertidal of California.
These earlier studies note that excretory products are a function
of the environment but fail to take into account the fact that
this gastropod is subjected to a wide daily variation in water
availability which could cause variation in the kidney contents.
In the present study attention was paid to the variation in the
tidal cycle and its possible effect on the nitrogenous constiÂ¬
tuents of the kidney.
METHOD
Two areaswere chosen from which to collect snails: one
population was located at the lower limits of the species in the
intertidal where there is water present 90% of the time: The
snails here measured from 7-9 mmin size. The second population
occurred at the upper limits of the intertidal where the snails
are exposed to air, wind, desiccation, and such approximately
95% of the time and range in size from 10-12 mm. Collections
were made at various periods through five tidal cycles. Two
series of observations two and one-half weeks apart were carried
