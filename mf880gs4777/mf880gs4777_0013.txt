L. planaxis has no prolonged increase or retention of uric acid
but that production is spasmodic and elimination rapid.
Ideally, the analyses of the kidney contents of L. planaxis
should have been carried on through one day's tidal cycle. Also,
an examination of the food eaten by the snails of these two
extreme areas in the intertidal might, to some extent, explain
the differences in the amounts of the various nitrogenous excretory
products found between the low and high snails in this investigation.
SUMMARY
1. There was found to variation in the total NPN as well as
constituent products in the kidney of Littorina planaxis.
2. Snails from low in the intertidal contained more NPN, ammonia,
and urea than those in the high regions.
3. Snails in the low area contained very little MPN and ammonia
at LLW.
4. Urea was found in smaller quantities than ammonia in snals
from both regions; in both areas, however, the average amount
of urea increased from the first tidal cycle observation to the
second, carried out two and one-half weeks later.
5. There was less undetermined-N in the kidneys of low area snails
than high. These averages decreased over a period of two and
one-half weeks.
6. Uric acid-N was negligible until the second tidal cycle
observations, where it then constitued up to 20.77 NPN in the
kidneys of higher snails and 3.137 NPN in those lower. This
production was very spasmodic with rapid elimination.
