out on small numbers of snails from both areas. The second,
less complete, was intended as a check on the first. Five samples
of ten snails each were examined at each point in the tidal cycle
in an effort to obtain an accurate estimation of the concentration
range of these products. At each of eight different times in
the tidal cycle fifty snails were gathered from one area and the
kidneys dissected out immediately. The dissections were trouble-
some, because kidney tissue is intermingled with surrounding
body tissue and difficult to extract whole. Ten kidneys were
weighed together after all excess water had been removed. This
tissue was ground and deproteinized with dilute sulfuric acid
and sodium tungstate at ph 6-7. There resulted five proteinÂ¬
free filtrates from each point in the cycle.
The total NPN was determined by the Kjeldahl method of
digestion with acid followed by Nesslerization. Ammonia content
was also determined by Nesslerization, as was urea, after
hydrolysis with urease (Baker and Adamson). Uric acid was
determined by the method of Benedict and Franke (1922). All
colorimetric measurements were made with a Klett-Summerson
Photoelectric Colorimeter and converted to milligrams of nitrogen
with a standard curve prepared on the same machine.
RESULTS
It can be observed from Figure 1, which shows the variation
in the nitrogenous excretory products of snails in the low
intertidal, that there is a definite drop in NPN at Low Low Water
when the snails were receiving a minimal amount of wave action.
