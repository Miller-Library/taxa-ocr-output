when the water was receding. The largest amount of NPN
(3.45-5.58 mg NPN/ gm. kidney) in the kidney of snails found
at this level was at HLW with a secondary peak at mid-LLW-HHW.
Because no reading was taken at mid-HLW-LHW, it is inaccurate
to state unequivocally that HLW was a definite high point with
a gradual decline thereafter. Figure 2 showing the various
nitrogenous excretory products through a second tidal cycle,
suggests that, on the contrary, there was a peak reached at
mid-HLW-LHW. Again, in Figure 1 ammonia seemed to vary directly
with the total NPN at each point in the tide, with the one ex¬
ception of HHW when ammonia content fell but NPN did not.
During this period snails were being submerged once every 30
seconds and splashed continuously. The urea content curve was
approximately the same as that of ammonia, but urea usually seemed
to be in smaller quantities. However, at LLW there was more urea,
12-427 of NPN, than ammonia, 9-197, and quite a lot of undeter¬
mined nitrogen, 46.47-77.122. Uric acid seemed to be present in
only trace amounts. (Refer to Table 1)
Observations made in the second tidal cycle, taken two
and one-half weeks later, on low L. planaxis, show that the least
amount of NPN occurred again at LLW (See Figure 2). Here there
was only one measurement, but it is significantly lower than
any point on either side. There was also a decrease at HLW,
but none at mid-HHW-HLW as in the first series of test. As for
the constituents, ammonia seemed to follow the same curve as that
in the first cycle, with low points at LHW, LLW, and HHW. Urea
again showed the same correspondence with ammonia except at LLW
when it constituted 46.77 of NPN and ammonia 40.5%. In this
