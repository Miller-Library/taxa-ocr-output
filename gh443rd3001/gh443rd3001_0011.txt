coralline algae. The scale is in cm. Note the
flushness of the colony.

Dodecaceria tolerance to osmotic stress at 11%a
Note that even the first to die are considerably
tolerant.
Figure 7.
Osmotic stress at 45%.. Many of the subjects were
alive at the end of 8 days. It is interesting to
note that Deep Reef worms survived 45%much more
successfully in relation to the other populations
than it did in 14%.
Mortality plot at 29Â°0 for Dodecaceria. Note the

Intertidal LD50 at this temperature is greater
than 48 hours. Temperatures of this duration and
degree are not found in the field.
