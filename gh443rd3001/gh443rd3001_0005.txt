have tube protrusions, whereas the coralline type is flush
with the colony surface. Tube orifices are solitary in the
coralline and Wharf areas, but fused to contain two or three
worms in the Deep Reef and Intertidal colonies. The general
form of the worms was consistent with the descriptions of D.
fewkesi by Fewkes (1889, Sabella pacifica) and Berkeley (1952,
D. pacifica).
The results of osmotic stress experiments are contained
in Figures 6 and 7. Intertidal and Wharf individuals survived
considerably longer at 14% than did the Deep Reef or Pinnacle
polychaetes. The Intertidal, Deep Reef, and Wharf worms with¬
stood 45%0 salinity longer than Monastery or Pinnacle subjects.
The experiment was terminated after eight days so as to limit
the effect of accumulated waste products, 0, depletion, or
other extraneous factors influencing mortality. When worms
were exposed to either 25% seawater or distilled water, im-
mediate release of a yellow-green pigment was observed and
death resulted. In 175% and 200% seawater, color was again
released with subsequent death, but it was darker green to
black in hue.
Oxygen depletion experiments resulted in no mortality
within three days to Dodecaceria from any of the collection
areas. After eight days, 5 of the 6 initial worms from each
location were still alive (see Table 2). All of the Dodeca¬
eria from the Pinnacles were active until the experiment was
terminated after eight days. No major differences in tolerance
