Population Studies on Dodecaceria

projections are not obvious unless the tube openings are pro¬
tected from wave shock. It appears possible that a transplanted
larva from any colony might forma tube, influenced by the
environment, which resembled the local colonies of that area.
This I was unable to verify since the worms were slow to recon¬
struct tubes, and larvae were not available. However, Inter-
tidal forms in glass tubes made tube extensions indistinguish-
able from those of the Deep Reef. In this case, the habitat
seemed to control the architecture of the colony. Glass tube
colony transplants among all five areas could yield conclusive
results as to the question of environment or genetic control
of colony morphology.
Individual body variation seems to coincide with size:
the more segments, the greater the length, and the more branchial
tentacles present. If all groups are considered one popula¬
tion, a continuum in characteristics is evident with the ex-
ception of length. Perhaps scouring by surge in areas of
coralline algae dwarfs the worms realized length by limiting
colony thickness. All the worm variations noted can be easily
influenced by environmental conditions and thus cannot be used
in evidence for or against the existence of a single or multi¬
ple species.
Osmotic stress does not seem to be an environmental
problem for D. fewkesi since in the lab they tolerated salinity
concentrations beyond extremes to which they are exposed in
the field. Intertidal Dodecaceria are exposed to greater
