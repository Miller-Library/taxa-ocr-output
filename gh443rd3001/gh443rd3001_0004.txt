Population Studies on Dodecaceria
Kauhanen 5
shell vials for each of the five populations in a 29Â°0 constant
temperature oven. Each vial contained one worm and 20 ml of
seawater. Examinations for mortality were made periodically
using a dissecting microscope.
Some worms were gently folded in half to simulate their
natural position inside their tubes and carefully placed in
2.5 mm internal diameter glass tubes about 2 cm in length with
one end melted shut. These were kept in running seawater.
RESULTS
Collection sites for Dodecaceria yielded different morphs
of the worm. Body length, number of segments, and number of
branchial tentacles raanged from 42.1 mm, 160 segments, and 7
pairsof tentacles for the Deep Reef morph to 13.8 mm, 85 seg-
ments, and 3 pair of tentacles for the Pinnacle variety. Values
for segment number and tentacle number of all worms examined
form a continuum between these extremes. Table 1 shows these
variations and variations in the colony morphology. Two major
colony types occurred, those in 1 to 2 cm thick coralline algal
mats found where surge was prevalent (Fig. 1 & 2) and those
growing in massive clusters 6 to 30 cm thick. The massive
type can be further divided into those building cement-like
boulders such as the Intertidal morph (Fig. 3) and those of
a more individual, less densely packed tube form, found on the
Deep Reef and Wharf (Fig. 4 & 5, respectively). The tube
openings of Intertidal, Deep Reef, and Wharf Dodecaceria, all
