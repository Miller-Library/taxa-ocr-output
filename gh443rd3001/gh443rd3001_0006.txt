Population Studies on Dodecaceria

were noticed among groups.
Preliminary temperature stress experiments showed that
Dodecaceria kept at 31°0 could survive more than six hours
although the worms did release their gametes. Figure 8 shows
survival time at 29°0. The Wharf and Intertidal groups not
only survived significantly longer, by a 2 X 2 independence
test (G-statistic), but were the most active when introduced
to this stress. (p£.00)
Tube building was observed in D. fewkesi placed in glass
tubes. After ten days, the inside of the glass was definitely
hazed by a white chalky substance and beginning signs of tube
extending were evident. After 25 days, the majority of the
worms in glass tubes had added up to 2.5 cm of this substance
to their now curving tubes (Fig. 9). This whitish substance
reacted in the same manner as the CacO, tube masses found in
nature when treated with 5% HCl. It was similar in appearance
except it lacked the sand grains found in the natural matrices.
DISCUSSION
One explanation for the variation in colony morphology
is the effect of habitat. It is possible that strong surge
could keep tube protrusion reduced, slowing vertical growth
of the colonies at Monastery and Pinnacles. In areas of less
surge, such as the Wharf and Deep Reef, tubes may not be kept
cropped, allowing detritus and sand to collect in between the
tubes and become cemented into the matrix. Intertidal tube
