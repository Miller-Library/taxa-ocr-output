Population Studies on Dodecaceria
Kauhanen 2
INTRODUCTION
One of the cirratulid polychaetes found in Monterey Bay,
Dodecaceria fewkesi, is a significant reef builder. It is
known to exist in thick mats of coralline algae and also in
massive limestone tube networks (Hartman, 1944) both inter-
tidally and subtidally. These two forms differ greatly in
appearance when viewed in the field. Variation in tube open-
ing, as noted by Berkeley (1932; 1954) is present, along with
differing amounts of tube protrusion. Moore (1909), Berkeley
(1932; 1952; 1954), and Hartman (1944) described the general
morphology of Dodecaceria yet little is known of the ability
of these polychaetes to withstand environmental stresses.
Investigation of tolerances of Dodecaceria fewkesi from various
habitats to salinity, decreased oxygen tension, and tempera¬
ture were carried out at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California, during April and May 1976. The purpose
of these experiments was to examine the variation in stress
tolerances of spatially separated populations as an indication
of reproductive isolation. Results of these experiments and
a discussion of certain morphological variations among dis-
tinct Dodecaceria populations are presented here.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Parts of the colonies were removed using a hammer and
chisel while on SCUBA. These clumps were kept in the labora¬
tory submerged in running seawater at 12°0. Prior to any of
