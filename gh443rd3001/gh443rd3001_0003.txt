worms was obtained. Only uninjured subjects were used for
experiments. All observations were made with a dissecting
microscope.
For the osmotic stress experiments, Instant Ocean (Aqua¬
rium Systems, Inc.) was added to 12°0 distilled water. These
solutions were glass-fiber filtered and salinity was checked
with a refractometer. Ten ml of 14% solution, approximating
50% normal seawater concentration, was added to twelve 25 ml
shell vials. This was repeated for the 45%0 solution or
roughly 150% seawater. Eight vials were run with a single
worm per vial and four vials with three worms per vial. All
vials were kept in a 12°0 water bath and the experimental sub¬
jects were checked for mortality. If no movement occurred
when the animals were disturbed with a probe, viewed at 20X
magnification with a dissecting microscope, they were presumed
to be dead.
Oxygen was depleted from seawater by bubbling N, through
a large jug of cold seawater for 25 minutes. Twenty ml were
then carefully siphoned into 25 ml shell vials, a worm added,
and a 5 mm layer of mineral oil poured over the surface. This
method for the exclusion of oxygen has been shown to be effec¬
tive (Bahr, 1974). The oxygen content of the depleted sea¬
water was found to be 0.3 ml/liter by the Winkler test modi-
fied by Carritt and Carpenter (1966). Inspection for mortal-
ity was done through the tube without disrupting the surface.
Heat stress was accomplished by placing twelve 25 ml
