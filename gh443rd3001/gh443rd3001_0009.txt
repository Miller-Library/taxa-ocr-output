Population Studies on Dodecaceria
Kauhanen 10
SUMMARY
1. The Dodecaceria collected at five various habitats varied
in appearance yet none of these variations indicate cer¬
tain genetic isolation over environmental effects.
2. Habitat may play the significant role in colonial morph-
ology, with surge possibly being a key factor.
3. No individual morphological evidence was found to support
a single or multiple species as within colony variation
is adequate to form a continuum of values if all popula¬
tions are treated as one.
4.
Tube extending is identical between Intertidal and Deep
Reef populations in the lab.
All populations tested were well adapted to handle any
naturally occurring osmotic stress.
6. Dodecaceria can live for more than eight days in reduced
O, tension of 0.3ml/liter.
7. Temperature must be extreme to be lethal as even at 31°0
a time interval of over six hours was needed to cause death
to the worms.
