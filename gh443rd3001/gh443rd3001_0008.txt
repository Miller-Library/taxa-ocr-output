environmental fluctuation so one would expect them to exhibit
greater tolerance to stressful conditions than subtidal worms.
In the field, exposure to air is limited to a few hours daily
by their location at the zero tidal level. This limits the
extent of potential osmotic stress resulting from exposure,
local fresh water input, and evaporative water loss. The
Wharf population of Dodecaceria also inhabits a fluctuating
and potentially hostile environment and may consequently ex¬
hibit greater salinity tolerance than other subtidal forms.
Even when removed from their tubes, all worms are quite able
to withstand a large range of salinity. It is assumed that
in the field, this ability is enhanced by the colony morphology
Reduced oxygen tension had little effect on Dodecaceria
over several days. This could be adaptive if the worms should
become buried by shifting sand. It is interesting that no
noticeable differences resulted among populations.
D. fewkesi can tolerate a wider range of temperatures
than it might encounter naturally. They are never exposed
long enough that temperatures could reach their lethal level.
The worms from the Wharf and Intertidal, areas which underge
the greatest temperature fluctuations, withstood exposure to
29°0 the longest and remained the most active of the worms
examined under these conditions. It is not clear wether
long-term acclimitization or inherent population differences
account for the variation in high temperature tolerance.
