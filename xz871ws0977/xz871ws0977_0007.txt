sharks of lengths 1.34 to 2.21 m (Table 1). Weihs (1981) reported
a swimming velocity of .62 to .72 m smi for bull and sandbar
sharks of lengths 2.0 to 2.3 m, and Parsons (1990) reported
swimming speeds of .29 to .67 m s-* for bonnethead sharks of
lengths .34 to .95 m. Both of these studies however were done at
25"C and, more importantly, measured these speeds over a fixed,
relatively short, and straight section of the tank. This study, on
the other hand, averages data from both the straight sections of
the tank and the sections where the sharks had to turn to
negotiate the walls. It was very clear from my observations that
the sharks swam fastest during the straight sections of the tank.
Since periods of wall negotiation were included in the calculation
of the average speed, it may explain why the speeds observed in
this study are lower than speeds of other species and lower than
Weihs' predicted velocities (Fig. 2). The curved portions of the
tank simply may prohibit the sharks from travelling at the optimal
velocity that Weins predicts.
