Figure Legend:
Fig. 1: The regression for cost of locomotion for swimming animals
The equation, y - 1.416w-o., relates the cost of locomotion
y in cal gri km' to the weight of the animal w in g. Note that
weight is expressed g. All other figures express the weight in kg.
Fig. 2: The optimal swimming velocities predicted by Weins (1981)
Weihs derived an equation which relates optimum velocity to
total length: Ua = 0.45641Â°. where Up is optimum velocity in m
sri and L is total length in m. The average swimming velocities
found for each of the sharks in this study are also shown in this
figure.
Fig. 3: Cost of locomotion using combinations of estimated
assimilation rates and resting metabolic rates
The line in this figure is the regression from Figure 1. When
weight w is measured in kg and cost of locomotion y is measured in
cal kgr' mi, the equation of this line becomes y - O.252w-o..
Fig. 4: Total cost of locomotion compared to predicted net cost
This diagram shows the relationship between estimated total
costs, using assimilation rates of 624 to 834, and predicted net
costs.
