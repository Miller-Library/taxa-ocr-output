Introduction
An animal must move to compete for prey, to avoid predation,
and to migrate. Movement requires energy as the animals must
produce thrust, overcome drag, and maintain bouyancy (Alexander,
197781982). Since animals require movement for daily activities,
the amount of energy put into the transport of body mass is of
interest. Cost of locomotion was defined by Schmidt-Nielsen (1972)
as the amount of fuel (in cal) necessary to transport one unit of
body weight (in kg) over one unit of distance (one m). SchmidtÂ¬
Nielsen (1984) and Beamish (1978) collated cost of locomotion data
for fish of sizes 1 to 1000 g and found that the cost of
locomotion decreases with increasing mass (Fig. 1). The largest
animal studied, however, weighed only 1000g. It was of interest,
therefore, to examine the cost of locomotion in larger fish.
The sevengill shark makes an ideal subject for such a study
for two reasons. First, individuals of this species can have a
mass in excess of 50 kg. This mass allows for a test of the
descending trend of Fig. 1 for an animal 50 times larger than the
largest shown. Only one other study of cost of locomotion in
sharks has been reported (Parsons 1990). The largest shark in that
study, a bonnethead shark, weighed only 8 kg. Secondly, the
sevengill shark is a ram ventilator. The shark must constantly
swim in order to circulate water over its gills and breathe.
Despite this ceaseless motion, a 51 kg captive sevengill shark
eats less than .8 kg of salmon a week (Gilbert Van Dykhuizen,
