Swimming Velocity
From the collected distance data, an average swimming
velocity was calculated and compared with Weihs' (1977) costÂ¬
optimization model.

Cost of Locomotion
The cost of locomotion, calculated using different
combinations of assimilation rates and resting metabolic rates,
are shown in Fig. 3. Most of the values generated from the
possible combination of assimilation and resting metabolic rate
cluster around the regression line obtained for other fish.
However some combinations, such as the lowest assimilation rate
(624) and the highest resting metabolic rate (269 cal kg-i h-i),
generate a cost of locomotion as low as O cal gri kmi. This cost
is obviously too low since an animal cannot move its body mass
without any energy expenditure. These zero results occur when the
assimilation estimate is too low, the resting metabolic rate
estimate is too high, or a combination of both. These points
illustrate the problem of defining a resting metabolic rate for an
animal that is in constant motion.
