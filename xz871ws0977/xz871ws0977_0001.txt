Abstract
The cost of locomotion is defined as the energetic cost of
transporting one unit of body mass one unit distance. Previous
experiments reported that the cost of locomotion in swimming fish
of sizes .OO1 to 1 kg follows a common trend: as body mass
increases, the cost of locomotion decreases. In this study, costs
of locomotion were calculated for sevengill sharks, Notorynchus
cepedianus, of weights 10.3 to 51 kg. The costs calculated
followed the trend previously reported. The sharks used in this
study represent the largest swimming fish for which the cost of
locomotion has been calculated and demonstrate that the cost of
locomotion trend holds for animals upward of 50 kg. Average
swimming velocities were also calculated in order to compare them
to a cost-optimization model based on the hypothesis that an
unmolested fish will swim at a velocity that requires the least
energy expenditure. In this study, swimming velocities varied from
.31 to .44 m smi over a total body length range of 1.34 to 2.21 m.
Ihese velocities are lower than those predicted by the costÂ¬
optimization model and those observed in two other shark species.
