personal comment).
This paper also compares swimming velocity of the sevengill
shark to both theoretical predictions and other shark species.
Weihs' (1977) hypothesized that an unmolested fish will swim at a
yelocity that requires the least energy expenditure per unit
distance travelled (Fig. 2). Parsons (1990) reported swimming
velocities for bonnethead sharks and Weihs (1981) reported
swimming velocities for bull and sandbar sharks. In both of these
studies, the observed speeds matched Weihs' prediction. The
velocities for these three sharks are compared to the average
velocity of the sevengill sharks.
Materials and Methods
General
Six sevengill sharks, Notorynchus cepedianus, were used for
this study. The sharks were held at the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
Monterey, California. Sex, weight, and length data for each shark
are contained in Table 1. During the study, water temperature was
130c (+-10c).
Cost of Locomotion
Four pieces of information are necessary to compute an
animal's cost of locomotion: 1) the amount of fuel ingested, 2)
