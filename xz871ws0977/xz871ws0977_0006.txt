Swimming Velocity
The swimming velocities found in this study are lower than
the optimal velocities predicted by Weihs (Table 1 and Fig. 2).
Discussion
Cost of Locomotion
The total cost of locomotion estimates made here were
slightly higher than the cost of locomotion predicted from the
general trend for swimming organisms (Fig.4), but when possible
resting rates are subtracted to yield net costs, the values
cluster around the predicted result (Fig. 3). However, since
assimilation rate and resting metabolic rate estimates were drawn
from other shark species, these results must be viewed with
caution. In conclusion, the results of this study support the cost
of locomotion regression found for other fish (Figs. 1 and 3) and
show that this relation correctly predicts the cost of transport
for sharks weighing upward of 50 kg. This explains the somewhat
surprising fact that a 50 kg shark can survive on less than 1 ko
of food per week.
