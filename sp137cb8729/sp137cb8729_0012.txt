they were stored or the rocks on which they live. In future experiments it would be
interesting to control natural factors (using temperature controlled tanks, artificial sea
water, etc.) as well as anthropogenic ones.
The results of this study raise several important questions. What is the identity of
the compounds that are substrates for the MXR protein? The extracts presumably contain
not only the plant/phytoplankton tissue but also chemical products the algae released as
byproducts or chemical defenses. Isolating the compounds would help identify the class
of substrates that are used with the MXR transporter.
As marine waters become more polluted it is extremely relevant to understand the
mechanisms that marine organisms have to deal with this problem. As development on
coastal area increases, with agriculture alongside it, the amount of nutrient run-off into
the ocean has increased dramatically. The increase in nutrients leads to higher plant
productivity and a greater number of algal blooms as well (Anderson and Garrison.
1997). The MXR system is not fully understood; its substrates and limitations are not vet
known. Algae and algal products are not only a possible explanation for the presence of
the MXR system, as they are a major part of the diet, but are also a current stressor on the
system. This ability of mussels to efflux natural toxins is critical in understanding their
ecology.

phytoplankton), Richard Kuo, and Melissa Kaufman.
