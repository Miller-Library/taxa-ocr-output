The major problem with the rhodamine accumulation assay was large variability
with controls. I found varying levels of fluorescence in tissues from the same mussel that
had been incubated with rhodamine, the only difference being the incubations started 20
minutes apart. I was able to eliminate the possibility of variations in the camera or
microscope with a fluorescent rhodamine light standard. This problem may be caused by
localization of MXR within the gill tissue, tissue deterioration, or damage during the
experiment. In future experiments I will add more rhodamine controls to account for this
variation. Since I pooled results of multiple experiments my results account for this
variation, but larger sample sizes would be preferred and will be used in future studies.
In the rhodamine efflux assay I found evidence for substrates in four of the six
likely candidates, three of which were phytoplankton. The two algal extracts
(Macrocystis and Phyllospadix) that indicated they did not contain substrates in the efflux
assay need to be retested with varying amounts, as their pigment may be interfering with
the fluorometer results and the fluorometer controls were only conducted for one
concentration of extract.
I did find that Macrocystis is an inducer for the MXR protein based on western
blot results. In both induction experiments where Macrocystis extract was injected into
the posterior adductor muscle, Western blotting showed significantly stronger staining of
a band at 170 KD then the controls exhibited, indicating induction of MXR protein took
place. This induction could be part of a “stress response" to a natural event, such as
when Macrocystis is releasing high amounts of byproducts (as seen with heavy
foam/mucus levels in the water), in which the mussel responds by elevating MXR
expression. Öther physical stressors, such as heat shock and or exposure to cadmium, are
