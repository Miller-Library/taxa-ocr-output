INTRODUCTION
A major inhabitant of the rocky intertidal zone of Monterey Bay, the mussel
Mytilus californianus feeds by filtering water through its gills and trapping particulate
matter. These waters contain both natural and anthropogenic toxins (xenobiotics) which
the mussels ingest through their diet or absorb directing from the water. An
understanding of how mussels and other marine organisms deal with xenobiotics, either
by transforming or effluxing them, is now emerging From this research there is
significant evidence that the mussels have a multixenobiotic defense mechanism (MXR)
which may protect them from toxins in their environment (Cornwall et al., 1995: Epel.
1998; Eufemia and Epel, 1998). This defense mechanism, an ATP-utilizing protein
pump, similar to the p-glycoprotein multridrug transporter (MDR) identified in human
tumor cells, provides protection by pumping toxins out of the cell.
The diet of the filter feeder M. californianus consists of particles that are remoyed
from the water and bound to mucus on the gill lamellae and then transported to the mouth
(Bayne, 1976). Mussels mostly consume particles under 1 10um, which includes bacteria.
diatoms, dinoflagellates, inorganic particles and fine organic detritus suspended in the sea
water (Morris et al., 1980; Newell et al., 1989; Hawkins and Bayne, 1992; Duggins and
Eckman, 1997; Raby et al., 1997). In addition to the phytoplankton, the mussel receives
à diet of seaweed particulates, especially during winter months when storms break the
kelp apart (Bayne, 199
Mussels may selectively feed on chlorophyll containing particles (Newell et al.,
1989) and there is also evidence that mussels prefer algal species low in phenolic
compounds, such as the Macrocystis and Egregia species (Steinberg, 1992). However.
thère appears to be no consensus on whether mussels are able to sort particles based on
