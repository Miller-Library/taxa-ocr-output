remove excess dye. The tissues were then placed on slides (without a coverslip) and
fluorescence visualized with a fluorescence microscope and images captured by a SIT
camera with an image analyzer.
Rhodamine efflux assay
To verify that the algae contain substrates for MXR, the rhodamine B efflux assay
was used with the extracts yielding positive results in the accumulation assay. In this
assay gill tissue is first loaded with rhodamine dye by incubating the gill fragments in dye
for one hour. The pieces are then removed from the dye, rinsed, and the rate of efflux of
dye into the surrounding media is measured over the next hour. The efflux is rapid in sea
water, but is slowed if a competitive substrate or inhibitor is present.
Six mussels were dissected and their gill tissues were evenly distributed between
petri dishes containing 30 ml FSW + 1 uM rhodamine. Dishes were incubated in the
dark at 15 degrees C for 1 hour. To remove excess dye, the media was removed with a
water aspirator and the tissues were rinsed for 30 seconds with FSW. Then 30 ml FSW +
20 uM verapamil or (30-100 ul ) extract was placed in the dishes, which were then
placed at 15 degrees C in the dark. 450 ul media was removed (in triplicate) and placed
in a 0.5 ml fluorescence cuvette at time points every 10 minutes for one hour and
fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer (EX = 550, EM = 580). To test for
possible fluorescence enhancement or quenching by the extracts, a control experiment
was also run with 1 ul rhodamine in 1 ml FSW + 2 ul each of the 6 extracts and 95% and
80% ethanol. Samples were placed in triplicate in fluorescence cuvettes and, after a 45
minute incubation, were measured in the fluorometer.
