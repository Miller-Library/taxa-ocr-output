thought to cause a general stress response; the question of whether exposure to a range of
chemical stresses could cause induction of MXR in mussels needs further research
(Eufemia and Epel 1998).
Phytoplankton are also important in the mussel diet, and if the phytoplankton
release toxic products, it would seem logical that the mussel has a defense against these
toxins. Currently (June 1998), there is a large phytoplankton bloom occurring in
Monterey Bay (species analysis is still occurring), and the mussels are exposed to these
blooms just about every year. In order to survive, the mussels must be able to deal with
extreme situations like this, especially if the phytoplankton produce toxins that could
harm the mussels. Mussels accumulate some of these toxins, but the accumulated toxins
are later released, perhaps effluxed via the MXR proteins. Understanding how a mussel
deals with a phytoplankton bloom is one of the future goals of my research.
The multidrug resistance (MDR) protein of mammalian tumor cells is
immunologically similar to MXR. Current research suggests the marine algae Caulerpa
taxifolia may contain substrates for MDR, making it a new candidate for reversal of
MDR in cancer treatment (Smital et al. 1996). In the future I would like to test algal
substrates I have identified for the MXR system in mussels with the mammalian MDR
protein.
Tobserved large natural variation in the amount of MXR protein in the mussels.
If natural products are substrates and inducers of the MXR transporter, the diet of the
mussels becomes as important a factor as pollution, temperature, and other stressors on
MXR. One of the major problems I encountered was that some mussels expressed either
very high or very little MXR. This might reflect the environment of the tanks in which
