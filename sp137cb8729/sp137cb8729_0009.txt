induction experiments were done in which Macrocystis induced increased levels of MXR
proteins in the western blot. The results of the Western blot for Psuedonizchia and
Alexandrium showed no difference in band darkness between control and extract-injected
mussels. (figure 8) Half of the gill tissue was used for a rhodamine accumulation assay
in every induction experiment. In these I found no significant difference between control
groups and extract groups, though all showed very high levels of MXR activity (figure 9).
DISCUSSION
Mussels, as filter feeders, are continuously exposed to algae and algal products,
whether it is from winter storms breaking up giant kelp into fine particulates or summer
phytoplankton blooms releasing toxic byproducts into the water. In examining the
mussel diet to find any natural substrates, I approached the question from an
environmental perspective, hoping the natural environment would provide clues to how
mussels deal with their natural environment as well as a polluted one. Mussels have
higher MXR titer in polluted environments versus pristine ones (Kurelec 1995), and T am
interested in understanding if a natural event, such as a phytoplankton bloom causes a
similar response in MXR protein levels.
My rhodamine accumulation experiments indicate six likely candidates for MXR
substrates (table 1). This data supports the idea that natural substrates are commonly
found in the mussel diet. Mussels are known consumers of all 3 of the phytoplankton
species that contain substrates, and given the abundance of the 3 seaweeds that contain
substrates, they would therefore be exposed to their products on a regular basis (Gosling
1992).
