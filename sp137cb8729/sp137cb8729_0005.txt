produced more extracts in MXR experiments, and thereafter all extractions were done
only with heated MeÖH. Äfter extraction, the solutions were evaporated using a vacuum
evaporator and resuspended in approximately 1 ml of ethanol (95%) and stored at -25° C.
The following phytoplankton species were cultured from Monterey Bay strains
provided by Jason Smith: (1) Alexandrium catenella, (2) Psuedonizchia australis, (3)
Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Extracts were made from approximately 40 ml. of
phytoplankton culture. The culture was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500g, the media
was removed, then the pellet was centrifuged for an additional 5 minutes, resuspended in
1 ml of 80% ethanol, sonicated for 20 seconds, and stored at -25° C.
Rhodamine assays:
To determine the levels of MXR activity two different assays were used: a
rhodamine B accumulation assay and a rhodamine B efflux assay. Rhodamine B is a
fluorescent dye that diffuses easily across the cell membrane and then is effluxed via the
MXR protein. Verapamil is a known substrate that blocks rhodamine dye from leaving
the cell via competitive inhibition with the MXR protein.
Rhodamine accumulation assay
For the accumulation assay 1-2 mussels were dissected on ice, the gills were
removed and placed in FSW and the mucus removed with forceps. Small (£ 25 mm)
tissue pieces were cut along the dorsal edge of each lamella and placed in 5ml sea water
+ TuM rhodamine + 20 uM verapamil or 5-10 ul extract. After a one hour exposure
period at 15 degrees C the gill tissues were rinsed in filtered sea water for 30 seconds to
