Induction studies
Four separate induction studies (see table 2) were conducted, each using different
substrates, methods of exposure (injection or water exposure), and lengths of time (from
24 hrs to 16 days). At the end of each study a gill tissue rhodamine accumulation assay
was carried out using half of the gills and the other half was frozen in liquid nitrogen and
saved at -80 degrees F. for the Western Blot analysis.
Increased protein activity and concentration was assessed by rhodamine B
accumulation assay and Western blotting, respectively. The rhodamine accumulation
assay was done as described above, with rhodamine + verapamil tested with each group.
Western blot analysis was carried out according to Eufemia and Epel 1998. Proteins
were resolved on 7.5 % polyacrylamide gels and proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes via semi-dry eletrophoretic transfer. Membranes were
incubated with MXR specific monoclonal antibody C219 and goat anti-mouse HRP
conjugated secondary antibody. Bands were detected by electrochemiluninescence
(ECL) Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Bradford Assay
(BIORAD) assay.
RESULTS
Rhodamine accumulation assay
I found fluorescence levels significantly (p = 0.05) lower than the rhodamine
control in: Gelidium (15% less) and Mazzaella (40% less), and not significantly different
from controls in Endocladia (2% higher), indicating these algal extracts did not contain
MXR substrates(figure 2). I found fluorescence levels significantly above the controls in
