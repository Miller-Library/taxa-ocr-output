organic content, size and/or species, and there is certainly no prescribed ideal mussel diet
which many would agree upon (Bayne, 1987; Jorgenson, 1996).
Soluble algal products in Monterey Bay come from seasonal phytoplankton
blooms and from anti-herbivory compounds released from seaweeds as part of their
growth processes (Steinberg, 1985; Paul, 1992). Algal blooms (some types are
commonly known as "red tides") are common during the summer months due to
upwelling, a process that brings more nutrients to the surface allowing for a burst of
phytoplankton growth in the waters (Smayda 1997). Several of the phytoplankton species
in these blooms produce toxins encountered by mussels in significant amounts since
mussels can accumulate the toxins in their tissues (Shumway 1992). Accumulation of
these toxins could come directly from the water or from ingestion of the phytoplankton
and accumulation of their toxic products. In coastal areas around the world, shellfish
poisoning is considered a major problem, as humans who ingest those shellfish during
periods of toxin accumulation can become ill and even die.
My hypothesis is two-fold: first, algae and algal products may be natural
substrates for the MXR protein. This defense mechanism would then prevent the algal
toxins from staying in the mussel or at least decrease accumulation and account for the
eventual removal of the toxins from mussel tissue. My goal was first to identify probable
substrates in seaweeds and phytoplankton that the mussels are exposed to in their natural
environments and secondly, to see if these algal products are inducers of the MXR
protein. To test my hypotheses I focused on identifying algal and phytoplankton
substrates for the MXR transport protein, and then, using the most likely substrates,
carrying out induction studies to see if they affected the level of MXR protein expression.
