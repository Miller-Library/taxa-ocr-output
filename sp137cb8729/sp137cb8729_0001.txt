ABSTRACT
The mussel Mytilus californianus is able to remove a wide array of xenobiotics
(toxins) from its cells using an ATP-driven transport protein. This Multixenobiotic
Resistance (MXR) system, similar to the multidrug transport protein found in human
tumor cells, is thought to be a first line of defense against many natural and
anthropogenic toxins. Three Monterey Bay seaweed species and three Monterey Bay
phytoplankton species were found to contain likely substrates for the MXR protein.
Extracts from all six species showed an increase in intracellular fluorescence using the
rhodamine B accumulation, indicating that these contain substrates for the MXR protein.
Mussels are filter feeders that remove seaweed particulates, phytoplankton, and their
byproducts from the waters that pass over them. Ifthe mussel diet contains compounds
that are substrates for the MXR protein, this would provide insight into the pressures
resulting in selection for this transporter, a mechanism that is a useful defense mechanism
in todayâ€™s polluted waters.
