1 found algal substrates and inducers for the MXR protein, suggesting an evolutionary
reason for the existence of the MXR system, a system that presumably evolved when the
mussels primary concern was natural and dietary toxins but may also effectively deal
with anthropogenic pollutants today
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mussels
Mytilus californianus were collected at the Hopkins Marine Station and kept in
both indoor and outdoor tanks, the former being temperature controlled at approximately
14 degrees C. Both tanks were aerated and received water from the sand filtered intake
pipe 60 ft. below sea surface. All mussels used were between 5-8 cm in length.
Extracts Preparation
The first step in identifying natural substrates for the MXR transporter was
making extracts of various seaweeds and phytoplankton collected from the Hopkins
Marine Station. The following seven prominent alga species were gathered: (1)
Macrocystis pyifera, (2) Egregia menziesii, (3) Phyllospadix scouleri, (4) Endocladia
muricata, (S) Mazzaella flacida, (6) Gelidium robustum. The extracts were made as
follows: the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a powder with a
pestle, 2 grams (wet weight) was placed in a test tube with 5 ml of solvent, after 15
minutes the extract was removed and the extraction was repeated two more times, for a
total of 15 ml of sample extract. The following solvents were initially used: Filtered Sea
Water (FSW), Methanol (100 %, at room temperature and at 70 degrees C), and Ethanol
(95%, at room temperature and at 70 degrees C). We found that the heated MeOH was
