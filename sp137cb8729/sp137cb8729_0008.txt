Macrocystis (50% higher), and Egregia (30% higher), and not significantly different but
above controls in Phyllospadix (7% higher), indicating that these extracts do contain
MXR substrates. I found fluorescence levels significantly higher than controls in the
phytoplankton species A. catenella ()and P. australis Q, and not significantly different
but above controls in P. tricornutum (), indicating that these extracts do contain MXR
substrates (figures 1 and 3, table 1). Ethanol controls were run with every experiment
and fluorescence levels were not significantly different than the rhodamine controls (data
not shown).
Rhodamine efflux assay
The rhodamine efflux assay showed evidence of substrates in the phytoplankton
extracts A. catenella, P. australis, P. tricornutum and the algae Egregia. (figures 4 and 5)
These four exhibited fluorescence efflux rate that was less than rhodamine, at
approximately the same rate as verapamil, indicating the extracts contained compounds
interfering with rhodamine efflux. Two algal species (Macrocystis and Phyllospadix)
showed fluorescence efflux at or above rhodamine control levels (figure 6) To eliminate
the possibility of enhanced fluorescence or fluorescence quenching caused by the extracts
a control experiment was run, and showed no significant effects on rhodamine
fluorescence intensity by any of the algae or phytoplankton extracts.(Figure 7)
Induction studies
In the long term (10 - 16 day) induction study 6 out of 29 mussels died, with the
probable cause of death wbeingas that too much blood was being withdrawn. Two
