ABSTRACT
Measurement of the physiological effects of the red algal
epiphytes Smithora naiadum (Anders.) Hollenberg and Melobesia
mediocris (Fosl.) Setch. and Mason on Phyllospadix torreyi Wats.
were made near Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California,
Field studies revealed a significant influence of these epiphytes
on both the breakage incidence and length, with that of Melobesia
being the most pronounced. Analysis of the photosynthetic rate
of this seagrass shows a decrease in the photosynthetic maxima
in both epiphytized samples at a light saturating intensity.
Under light limiting conditions, an increase in photosynthetic
efficiency and a change in chlorophyll a composition in both
epiphytized sample types suggest an adaptive mechanism similiar
to those found in terrestrial and aquatic shade plants.
