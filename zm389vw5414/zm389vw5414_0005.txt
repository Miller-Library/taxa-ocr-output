Therefore, my results indicate that the presence of Melobesia
and Smithora on P. torreyi does have a significant effect on both
the breakage incidence and length of this surfgrass in its natural
environment.
LAB EXPERIMENTS
Materials and Methods
Laboratory experimentation investigating the physical effects
of the algal epiphytes oncluded measurement of the photosynthetic
rate at saturating and light limiting intensities, and chlorophyll
analysis of P. torreyi.
All samples taken were 8cm long, 46-54cm from the new sheath
on the oldest lamina. Collection took place on cloudy days to
avoid variation in photosynthetic rates due to drastic differences
in light intensity. Samples were kept in aquaria with running
sea water. Fresh weight were taken and photosynthetic rates were
measured within 12 hours of collection as suggested by Drew (1979)
using a Gilson pressure constant differential respirometer. This
procedure has been documented by Umbreit (1972). The side arm
contained approximately 1 ml of standard bicarbonate buffer
solution to keep C0 levels constant throughout the duration of
the experiment. Temperature was set at 15'C, and readings were
taken every 15 min. for 180 min. All rates were calculated in
ul of Oo/cm2. Surface area was chosen to accurately represent
the amount of photosynthetic pigments whichaare located in the
outer epidermis of the Phyllospadix blade. Rates were measured
on all three sample types at a saturating light level of S
256uE/m2/sec, and at a limiting light intensity of 51uE/m/sec.
