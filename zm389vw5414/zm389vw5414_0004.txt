Discussion
From these results it is shown that no linear relationship
between epiphytic weight and mean breakage length exists.
Samples with Melobesia have only 15% higher fresh weight on
average than samples without, yet 1.5 times more samples broke,
and the mean breakage length was 2.5 times longer. Samples with
Smithora, on the other hand, have approximately 600% higher
fresh weight than without, but only 2.5 times more samples broke,
and the mean breakage length was only 4 times longer. This
indicates that epiphytic weight is not the only factor determining
the maximum load on Phyllospadix, nor even the most prevalent.
Texture may affect the drag on individual blades and there-
fore influence breakage incidence and length. Smithora, although
having a much larger surface area, is smooth and very flexible!
If presented flat surface to the stream, there would be considerÂ¬
able resistance; if lying parallel to the stream, it would offer
no resistance. On the other hand, the flat, epidermis-hugging
thalli of Melobesia have hard, stoney and rough surface and may
offer considerable resistance to water motion. Another possibil-
ity may be that Melobesia in some way weakens the Phyllospadix
blade making it more susceptible to the water motion charac-
teristic of the environment of Phyllospadix.
The maximum length broken from blades in each of the three
sample types along with the frequency of occurance for this
breakage length are shown in Table 2. For samples with Smithora,
a 20% loss of total blade length in the 25h tidal cycle occurred
three times. Growth rates of epiphytized Phyllospadix as high as
2.5cm per day for the youngest lamina of the new sheath
(Turhollow 1980 - preliminary study) make this finding reasonable.
