Results
At saturating light levels, non-epiphytized samples had a
mean photosynthetic rate of 20.2 ul 0/cm/h (Figure 2).
Samples with Melobesia and with Smithora had significantly
lower rates of 16.7((pc.06), and 6.48 (p«.01) respectively.
Under light limiting conditions, however, no significant dir
difference was found. The mean rate for my control group at this
intensity level was 7.61 pl 0/cm/h, while for samples with
Melobesia and Smithora the mean photosynthetic rates were 6.37
and 6.13 ul 0/cm/h respectively.
Total chlorophyll content, measured in ug per unit surface
area, was 26.7 pg/cme for the control group (Figure 3). Samples
with Melobesia and with Smithora had significantly less chlorophyll
with mean values of 15.5 (p4.01) and 20.4 (p2.06) ug/cm respec¬
tively. No significant difference between the chlorophyll a/b
ratios for all three sample types was found. Likewise, the
chlorophyll b content was relatively constant in all three cases,
and the differences found in total chlorophyll content were
reflected in the amount of chlorophyll a between the three sample
types (pg.05 for both).
Analysis of chlorophyll content for the non-epiphytized
blades from the tank experiment showed an increase in the amount
of total chlorophyll with increasing distance from the meristem
in all three cases (Figure 4). Total chlorophyll content was
not significantly different among samples taken from the three
tanks. However, in the 0-8cm region, less total chlorophyll
was found in the blades from tanks covered with the purple filter
and with the Nitex screen. Again, chlorophyll b levels were
