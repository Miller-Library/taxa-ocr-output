chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and maximum load under
field conditions of this surfgrass are examined.
FIELD STUDIES
Materials and Methods
The first part of this project was to determine the maximum
epiphytic load the individual blades of Phyllospadix can with-
stand before breaking. Choosing the intertidal region between
Seal Rock and Agassiz Beach near Hopkins Marine Station as the
sampling site, I marked blades, 50cm in length (+ 2cm) with
color-coded wires. Twenty samples of the oldest lamina from the
new sheath in each of three categories were tagged: 1) non¬
epiphytized Phyllospadix, 2) Phyllospadix with a dense covering
of Melobesia, and 3) of Smithora. After one 25h tidal cycle,
the samples were harvested and examined under a dissecting micro¬
scope for signs of recent breakage. Any breakage, measured in
length, constituted the category "% broken" in Table 1. An
open wound, irregular fibers at the tip, and fresh green color
at the tip were used as indicators.
Results
When compared to the control group of non-epiphytized blades,
2.5 times more blades with Smithora and 115 times more blades with
Melobesia broke (Table 1). Pieces which broke from samples with
Smithora and with Melobesia were 4.3 and 2.5 times longer,
respectively, than pieces which broke from the control group
(p«.06 for both).
Water motion during this 25h tidal cycle was measured with
clod cards (Doty 1971). A diffusion index of .179 was observed.
