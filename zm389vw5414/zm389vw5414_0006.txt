levels produces an actual light-limiting condition (Drew 1979).
He investigated the photosynthetic rate of Phyllospadix vs.
irradiance (Figure 1), which I used as a theoretical base.
At 20% of the saturation light level, the relationship between
photosynthetic rate and irradiance is strictly linear, indicating
limiting light conditions.
Pigment analysis was made by extracting chlorophyll with
5% dimethylsulfoxide in methanol. The samples were ground up
with purified sand using a mortar and pestle, and then centrifuged.
Readings were recorded on an ACG #SP2 spectrophotometer (Beckman)
at 650, 665, and 710 nm. The amount of chlorophyll was calculated
using equations provided by Jeffrey and Humphrey (1975).
To investigate the effects of the changes in light quantity
vs. light quality, three aquaria were placed outdoors equipped
with running sea water. Five bare blades with intact rhizomes
collected from the West Beach area were placed in each, and the
individual lamina were kept separate to prevent self-shading.
Only the tops of the aquaria were exposed. A purple cellophane
filter was placed over one tank which allowed passage of wave-
lengths 480nm and 650nm. The light passing through the filter
corresponds to the wavelengths absorbed by chlorophyll a (peaks
at 445 and 665nm). Absorption spectra were run on the filter
as well as on a fresh blade of Smithora for comparison. The
second tank was covered with a double-layer of Nitex screen
corresponding to a neutral density filter. The third tank was
left exposed. In addition to the change in light quality passing
through the purple filter, both the filter and screen decreased
the quantity of light passing through by 75%. After seven days,
the blades were harvested. Chlorophyll was extracted from areas
