relatively constant in this region, and the differences in total
chlorophyll are reflected in th different amounts of chlorophyll a.
No significant differences were found between the chlorophyll a/b
ratios in samples from all three tanks. These values were in the
same numerical range as the epiphytized and non-epiphytized
samples measured previously.
Discussion
From the differences observed between the photosynthetic
rate at saturating light levels, three different photosynthetic
maxima are apparent: 1) non-epiphytized samples have the highest,
2) samples with Melobesia are intermediate, and 3) those with
Smithora have the lowest maxima. These differences, in addition
to the constant photosynthetic rate between all three sample
types under light limiting conditions, effectively illustrate
that three distinctly different adaptive mechanisms are present.
Analysis of photosynthetic rate per unit of chlorophyll
(Figure 5) reveals that under light limiting conditions both
epiphytized samples are operating more efficiently. Samples
with Melobesia have the least amount of chlorophyll and are
therefore the most efficient. This adaptation is characteristic
of many terrestrial and aquatic shade plants (Bjorkman 1973).
which are able to change their photosynthetic efficiency and/or
chlorophyll content to adapt to changes in light intensity.
On the other hand, the decrease in the photosynthetic rate of the
control samples by 62% when placed under limiting light conditions
is characteristic of sun plants which are not able to adapt to
these environmental changes.
