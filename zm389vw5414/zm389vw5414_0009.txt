Forte (10)
have shown an increase in the a/b ratio with decreasing light
intensities. However, my studies reveal a relatively constant
ratio with respect to light intensities. The changes in total
chlorophyll are reflected in the amount of chlorophyll a found
in each of the three sample types. A list of a/b ratio values
found for other seagrasses have been included for comparative
purposes (Table 3). Of the five species located in tropical
waters, only Halophila decipiens Ostenfeld (Buesa 1975) has
been observed to have a comparable photosynthetic rate with the
non-epiphytized samples in this study. Therefore, other
environmental parameters may affect the chlorophyll a/b ratio
in these tropical seagrasses, and further studies are necessary
before strict comparisons can be made. In addition, Drew (1978)
has found a seasonal variation in the a/b ratios of the seagrasses
Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Aschers. and Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile
with values during the Spring being the highest. This may in part
explain why my values are near the higher end of the range found
for chlorophyll a/b ratios in seagrasses, but seasonal measurements
on P. torreyi have not been done previously.
My observations of a change inhlorophyll a composition with
varying light intensities disputes conclusions by Wiginton and
McMillan (1979). In a study which measured theochlorophydl content
of five seagrasses grown under different light conditions, changes
solely in chlorophyll b levels as an adaption to changes in
irradiance were observed by them.
Changes in total chlorophyll, as well as in chlorophyll a
levels in the tank experiment support my previous observations.
Although similiar changes were not found in either the 20-28 or
