INTRODUCTION
The surfgrass Phyllospadix torreyi Wats. grows attached to
rocks or to rocky substrata ranging from the lower part of the
intertidal to a depth of around 30m. It is found as far North as
Oregon and continues South to Baja, California (Munz and Keck 1959).
Strong rhizomes enable the plant to grow in well-aerated, surf-
beaten areas where a rich supply of nutrients are available for
gregarious growth.
The seagrass itself, however, is only one component of the
primary producers in the Phyllospadix commumity. Epiphytic
algae, including Smithora naiadum (Anders.) Hollenberg and
Melobesia mediocris (Fosl.) Setch. and Mason, at maximum develop-
ment amount to as much as 50% of the total leaf-plus-epiphyte
biomass (McRoy and McMillan 1977).
The smooth lamina of P. torreyi provides both a suitable
substrate for the basal cushion of Smithora, and sufficient
surface area to support the calcareous alga Melobesia. Because
Phyllospadix extends high into the water column, both of these
epiphytic red algae receive light of high intensity and nutrients
from the water motion which are essential for growth.
The physiological effects of the epiphytes on Phyllospadix,
however, are not well known. Some work (Harlin 1975) has been
done on P. scouleri Hook. Previous work by Sand-Jensen (1977)
has shown a decrease in the photosynthetic rate of Zostera marina L.
by 31% in the presence of encrusting diatoms, Cocconeis
scuttellum Ehr.
This paper examines the symbiotic relationship between
P. torreyi and two of its epiphytes, Smithora naiadum and Melobesia
mediocris. Specifically, the effect of these epiphytes on the
