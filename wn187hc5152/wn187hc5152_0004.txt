each experimental run to minimize abnormal behavior brought
on by extended periods in a lab environment. The animals
were gathered during the months of April and May from a
single high tidepool at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, Cali-
fornia. This pool received very little wave action. It
was approximately 1 meter long and 1/2 meter wide, with
its depth varying between five and twelve cm. during the
two month interval. The salinity varied between 35 and 75
ppt.
It is important to note that activity counts obtained
show the number of counts per hour at a particular level in
the water column. Counts alone, however, provide no feel
for population distribution. A doubling of activity counts,
for instance, could mean that:
1. the density of animals at that particular level
increased by a factor of two,
2. the density remained constant and the animals
doubled their activity, or
3. any combination of varying density and activity took
place which would account for a two-fold increase in
the number of counts.
If the number of animals around a counter, therefore,
stays constant for a given set of conditions, then the
counter is an activity meter. Through the use of photographs,
a population distribution can be observed. Horizontal lines
were drawn through each detector in the photo and individuals
were counted 1/8 inch to each side of the lines. This is
shown in Figure 4. Each activity count for the hour prior
to the time of the photograph was then divided by its
corresponding visual count and a true activity, or activity
per individual was determined. By combining all of the
counts one can assay for overall activity.
