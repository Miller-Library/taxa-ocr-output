Materials and Methods (Field Studies)
Field studies were carried out in the same high
tidepool from which test animals for the lab studies were
gathered. A sampler, depicted in Figure 17, was construcÂ¬
ted to examine water column distribution. It consisted
of two pieces of plexiglass, approximately 1/2 meter long.
13 cm. wide and 2 cm. thick. Holes 2 cm. in diameter
were drilled in one piece with centers approximately 3cm.
apart. A sheet of plankton netting was glued to one face
of this piece.
Both plexiglass sheets were vertically placed in
the center of the tidepool. The side with holes faced
the solid sheet at a distance of about 20 cm. The drilled
piece was laterally moved toward the other until both were
flush, trapping the animals in various compartments. The
number of individuals in each was counted and an overall
water column distribution was determined. Samples were
taken under various conditions.
