Introduction
The high tidepool, with its tremendous variability
in environmental conditions over very short periods of
time, can provide a home for only the heartiest of animals.
Tidepool dwellers must contend with large daily fluctuations
in water temperature. Since such pools receive very little
splash, evaporation causes severe extremes in salinity, as
well. This paper attempts to examine light, temperature,
salinity as high tidepool parameters and show their effect
upon the behavior of one such inhabitant, Tigriopus cali
fornicus.
Tigriopus is an ideal test animal for work in
behavioral studies. Approximately one millimeter in length,
this copepod is a convenient size, large enough for easy
counting with the naked eye, yet small enough so that
experimental set-ups can contain large populations to
decrease error without becoming cumbersome. The animal's
abundancy provides large numbers of individuals from the
easily accessible high tidepools.
Correlations between activity and water column
distribution will be explored. This behavior will then
be related to the possible survival strategies of the
animal. Although this paper only deals with one particular
species, one may gain insight to population behavior in
general.
