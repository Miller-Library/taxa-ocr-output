Results and Discussion (Field Studies)
The findings of four field samples are shown in
Figure 18. It is interesting to note the distribution
in darkness. The histogram for actual distribution is
quite similar to that for mean activity shown in Figure
7. Large differences, however, do appear in comparison
to that distribution shown in Figure 4. Discrepancies
may result in that animals on the bottom may be swept
up as the sampler is moved.
If one examines the distribution on the top,
similarities to the light experiments can be noticed.
There are the greatest number of individuals at the top
for intermediate intensity. For instance more animals
are congregated near the surface at 500 LUX than either
at darkness or 3600 LUX. Combining this with the lab
findings, one can hypothesize that at some intensit
perhaps around 1600 LUX, the increase in surface activity
correlates to an actual increase in surface density,
