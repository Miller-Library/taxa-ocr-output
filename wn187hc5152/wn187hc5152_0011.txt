Summai
1. A population of Tigriopus californicus in constant
darkness, 15 degrees C. and 34 ppt. salt water will
distribute themselves such that the majority of the
animals are at the top and the bottom. Those nearest
the bottom, with the exception of those resting on the
bottom, have a higher activity than those animals
higher in the water column.
2. The bulk of the population is somewhat homogeneous
in behavior in that there appears to be few, if any,
having distinct bottom-loving or top-loving tendencies.
The majority seems to periodically move up and down.
There seems to be some intermediate light intensity,
around 1600 LUX, causing density increases at the top
of the water column.
4.
The resting metabolism of a Tigi
riopus population over
the temperatures of a naturally occurring tidepool
seems to be temperature independent.
5. An actual preference to a salinity lower than sea
water, about 18 ppt., seems to be apparent in an
animal population.
