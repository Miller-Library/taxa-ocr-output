Figures 9 and 10 show the activity per individual
at different levels for three different times during the
run. One observes that an animal linearly decreases its
activity as that animal nears the surface. Near the top
it may reduce its activity to a level required to overcome
the negative buoyancy of the animal. One can possibly
describe the distribution as one of orthokinesis. Since
an animal near the bottom is much more active than another
near the top, those lower in the water column are more apt
to spend less time in that region. Thus there is a higher
probability of finding a particular animal in the upper
areas.
After a baseline was established, various stimuli
were added and their effects compared. Figures 11 and 12
show the response of Tigriopus to an artificial light
cycle over a 24 hour period. These runs were made at 15
degrees C. and 34 ppt. The top histogram shows counts per
hour on top as a function of light intensity and time. As
the intensity is increased from darkness to 110 LUX, there
appears a slight increase in activity. A dramatic increase
in activity on the top then occurs upon the transition to
1600 LUX. As the intensity is further increased to 3500
LUX, however, a drop in surface activity is apparent. When
the intensity is again set to 1600 LUX, the high activity
resumes. The decreasing levels of light intensities are
then characterized by the corresponding decrease in surface
activity. The bottom histogram, showing a plot of activity
per individual, takes on the same relative shape as the
upper graph.
Light, therefore, greatly affects activity. At some
intensity around 1600 LUX there is a marked increase. If
activity in this case is directly related to actual numbers
of animals, then at this level more animals will be in the
water column, and in particular on top. This may be a
selective advantage. Perhaps the animal can readily detect
food, predators, waves, etc. at this level. This would
