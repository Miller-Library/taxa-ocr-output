hour after the population was introduced into the gradient.
Activity rapidly falls off to each side of this peak. A
similar shape can be seen from data at 14 hours. The curve,
however, is shifted to a much lower salinity, with the
peak centered at 18 ppt. At eighteen hours, the shape
remains the same, again peaking at about 18 ppt. with a
substantial decrease in activity.
At the three time points under observation, photo-
graphs were taken. Note the bands of high animal concen-
tration in the photo of Figure 17. Points for activity
per individual were calculated and plotted as a function
of salinity in Figure 18. (Photographic counts less than
five were not used as data points since the reliability
of the value was poor). The three-line plot clearly shows
a decrease in true activity as time increases. It is
important to note that the slope of the 1 hour and 14 hour
lines are equal. If the animals were using orthokinesis
to cluster at a given salinity, one would expect that, in
that region, the animals would be least active and that
activity would increase as the animals deviated from that
salinity. The Figure 16 data, however, contradicts this
by the low activity readings at the higher salinities.
