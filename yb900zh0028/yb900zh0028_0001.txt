INTRODUCTTON
Investigations have shown that that portion of the Coliform
group found in the gastrointestinal tract and feces of warm blooded
animals has the ability to ferment lactose with the production of gas
under suitable conditions involving restrictive media and elevated
temperatures. Since bacteria from other sources are, for the most
part, unable to produce gas under such conditions, this criterion has
been used to indicate the presence of fecal Coliforms in bodies of
water, and the presence of such bacteria has become a standard micro-
biological parameter indicating water contamination. The reliability
of this test for the marine environment has been questioned however,
since the number of Coliforms detectable often fluctuates unpredictaly
over short periods of time and may depend upon such factors as cloud
cover (1) and ocean currents. The microfauna associated with marine
sediments may not be subject to such fluctuations. The purpose of this
paper is to indicate a second biochemical parameter which may reflect
domestic sewage pollution, and which might be used to confirm or even
replace Coliform determinations in the marine environment. The rationaie
for this new criterion is related to the urease activity of the enteric
Proteus vulgaris, a common bacterium in the intestinal tract of man.
Amounts of the enzyme urease can be readily determined due to the ammonia
which is produced upon hydrolysis of urea by the enzyme. This study is
an attempt to correlate urease activity in marine beach sediments with
proximity to ocean sewage outfalls.
