Urease Activity of a Jack Bean Urease Preparation -
The action of several concentrations of Jack Bean urease upon
the test medium was investigated. So as to mimic conditions used in
tests upon ambient sands, 50 grams of sand sterilized for four hours
(250 C., 15p.s.i.) was included in the preparation. As can be seen
from Figure 1, the rate of ammonia evolution is directly related to
the enzyme concentration.

Urease Acivit
of Proteus vulgaris-
The urease activity of various numbers of the urease containing
bacterium P. vulgaris was investigated. The results of this experiment
appear in Figure 2.
The rate of urea breakdown can be related to the density of
P. vulgaris. Although this relationship requires further quantitation,
Figure 3 shows a plot of the rate of the reaction vs. the number of
P. vulgaris, as revealed by this experiment.
Relationship Between Sediment Size and Urease Activity
The effect of sediment particle size on urease activity was
investigated using sand obtained 30 feet from the Pacific Grove sewage
outfall pipe (Station +10, Figure 6). This sediment was divided into
three fractions with the aid of Tyler screens: "coarse" : 3.9 - 2.9 mm.,
"medium" : 2.9 - 1.9 mm., and "fine" : 2 1.9 mm. Figure 4 presents the
results of this determination. A clear relationship between particle
size and urease activity in sand from this polluted area is indicated.
