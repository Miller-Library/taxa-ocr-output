Sands from the west beach of the Hopkins Marine Station (Station k7,
Figure 5), a relatively unpolluted area of Monterey Bay, were similariy

examined. Only a trace of urease activity was detected in any of these
sediment fractions. The slow rises before definitive slopes are
established in Figure 4 may be attributed to fluctuations in the air
flow, a condition which was corrected at 30 hours. In all subsequent
urease tests, the "fine" sediments were used and the air flow was
held constant.
Urease Activity in Marine Sediments
A study of beach sediments collected at various distances from
two marine outfalls was undertaken. The entire study area, comprising
some five miles of the southern shoreline of Monterey Bay is depicted
in Figure 5, with sampling stations 1 - 8 indicated. Figure 6 is an
enlargement of the Pacific Grove study area showing the positions of
stations 9 - 12 relative to the outfall pipe.
Sample stations 1 -6 were located in the vicinity of the
Monterey outfall, along a beach made up of homogenously fine (1.9 -
0.9 mm.) sand. This outfall is subtidal and 800 feet from shore.
Figure 7 indicates the amount of urease activity detectable on the day
these sediments were sampled. Current studies in this area indicate a
dominant onshore flow outside the surf zone in this area, and a net flow
to the west, in the direction of the Monterey Municipal Wharf No. 2 (4).
Urease activity reflects the current pattern as it is understood. Sample
station 6lies very close to the aforementioned wharf ; this area
receives an additional load of sewage from restaurants and moored boats.
