MATERTALS AND METHODS
Marine Sediments
Sands were always obtained where they were barely awash.
Samples were taken at both low and high tide. The sediments were
collected in 500 ml. wide-mouthed, plastic, screw-capped jars along
with approximately 50 ml. of the ambient waters. In the laboratory,
the samples were stored at sea water temperature (13-15 C.) until they
could be tested. The time elapsed between collection and testing was
never more than two hours.
Urease Assay -
150 ml. of a test medium consisting of 30.0 grams Nacl and
50.0 grams urea CO(NH2)2 per liter of distilled water was filter ster-
ilized and placed in a small-mouthed, 250 ml. glass bottle. Recently
collected sand was dried for thirty seconds on a clean blotter, then
50.0 grams were weighed and placed in the test bottle. The ph was
adjusted to 9.5 with 0.1 N Naoh and the bottles were incubated at
37.0°C. (+ 0.5° C.) in a water bath. Air which had passed through a
cotton filter was bubbled through the test solution at the rate of
130 cc. per minute, and ammonia was trapped in 10 ml. of a saturate
boric acid solution containing a mixed indicator (2) held in a 125 ml.
Erlenmeyer flask. The amount of ammonia released from the test prep-
aration and trapped in the boric acid was determined by titration at
intervals of time with 0.01 N HCl. After each titration, a fresh boric
acid trap was attached.
