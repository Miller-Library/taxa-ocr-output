DISCUSSION
The amount of urease activity in beach sediments along
Monterey Bay appears to be related to proximity to sewage outfalls
(from plants utilizing primary treatment processes only). Although
in this study no attempt was made to determine the source (s) of this
enzyme, the relationship between sediment particle size and urease
activity suggests the presence of microorganisms. Further, the urease
activity observed in local sediments can be mimicked through the use
of suspensions of Proteus vulgaris. This organism shows appreciable
survival in marine materials.
Urease activity is not a conspicuous property of marine
bacteria. Of 130 random bacterial isolates from the Monterey Bay
intertidal, only 4 showed the ability to decompose urea (5). Bergey'
Manual (6) lists only three marine organisms which show urease
activity : Sarcina ureae, Bacterium ammoniagenes, and Bacillus pasteurii.
All were originally isolated from sewage, feces, or decomposing urine,
but are thought to be able to exist in salt water. Members of the
genus Proteus, all of which show urease activity, have been isolated only
rarely from air, soil, or fresh water that has not been contaminated
with fecal material (7). Therefore, the measurement of urease activity
