Enu
eration of Proteus vulgaris and Escherechia coli-
The M.P.N. of E. coli was determined by standard methods (3).
Difco urea broth was used to test for the presence of P. vulga
is in
survival experiments and to detect the presence of the genus Proteus
in sea water. Plate counts (on Difco nutrient agar) were used to
enumerate P. vulgaris.
Enzyme Preparation -
Jack Bean urease was prepared from Matheson Coleman and Bell
tablets by grinding in distilled water. Urease preparations used in
subsequent tests were prepared using two 25.0 mg. tablets per ml. of
water. The urease was activated by the addition of 0.2 ml. of
14% sodium pyrophosphate solution.
