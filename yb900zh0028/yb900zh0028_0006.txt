visible at times of low tide. Station 9 (Figure 6) lies across a small
surge channel from the pipe and receives effluent only at high tide.
Station 8 (Figure 5) is a public bathing beach. Figure 8 shows the
amount of urease activity observed in sediments collected from these
areas.
The overlying waters at all stations were cultured for the
presence of urease producing bacteria. In all cases these tests were
negative.
Survival of Escherechia coli and Proteus vulgaris in Sea Water and Se
100 ml. of unfiltered Monterey Bay sea water was placed in a
250 ml. glass bottle. 1.0 ml. of a suspension of either bacterium
containing between 1X102 and 1X107 bacteria per mililiter was added, and
the preparation was aereated at 200 cc. per minute. The bottles were
incubated at sea water temperature (13 - 15Â° C.). At time intervals,
the bottles were vigorously shaken and 5.0 ml. aliquots of liquid were
removed for enumeration of surviving bacteria. Figure 9 shows the results
of this experiment. The viability of both organisms under these con-
ditions seems to be similar.
Survival in wet sand was tested by placing 5.0 grams of sterile
"fine" sand in 10 X 100 test tubes along with 0.5 ml. of sterile sea water.
The tubes were innoculated with a dose of organisms similar to that used
above. All tubes were incubated at sea water temperature and at time
intervals were tested for growth of urease producing or lactose fermenting
bacteria. Both species were able to survive for over a week in moist
