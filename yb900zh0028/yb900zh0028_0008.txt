in marine sediments shows promise as a measure of the area contaminated
by sewage outfalls.
A lag of from 14 to 22 hours before ammonia can be detected
is evident in tests involving natural sediments and at all but the
highest concentration of P. vulgaris in innoculated sands. Yet only
a minimal lag appeared when Jack Bean urease was tested. Attempts to
remove this lag by pre-incubation for 24 hours in 3% NaCl before addition
of urea, increased air flow, and the addition of appropriate amounts
of ammonium chloride all met with failure. Growth of P. vulgaris in
nutrient broth containing 1% urea for 24 hours prior to harvest and
testing succeeded in lowering the time lag, but only to 8 hours.
Therefore, it seems unlikely that the observed lag is caused by a
purely adaptive enzyme system. Although natural sediments contain
some organic matter, growth must be minimal. No growth permitting
substances were included in the urease assay medium. The duration of
the lag did not seem to affect the rate of observed urease activity.
and this rate could be directly r√©lated to either the amount of
Jack Bean urease or the number of P. vulgaris added.
Further research is necessary to determine the source or
sources of urease present in the sediments studied. Also, an accurate.
simple assay must be developed before urease activity in marine
sediments can be used as a convenient test for sewage pollution.
This study indicates that such further research is warranted.
