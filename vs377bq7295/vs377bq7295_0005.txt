The addition of the calcium specific ionophore, ionomycin, resulted in an elevated
fluorescence intensity from 1 to 1.4 AF/F (Fig 2). The intracellular calcium concentration
increased from a resting concentration of 104 nM to 1058 nM.
The addition of glutamate resulted in elevated fluorescence intensity compared to a saline
control reaching a maximum intensity of approximately 1.27 AF/F (Fig 3). The intracellular
calcium concentration increased from a resting concentration of 102 nM +- 38 (95% confidence
interval) to 366 +- 149 nM averaged over 16 individual cells from two independent experiments.
When the optic tectum slice was incubated with the NMDA-R antagonist, APV, the
addition of glutamate resulted in no elevated fluorescence intensity compared to a saline control
(Fig 4). The calcium concentration increased from 100 +- 37 nM to 112 +- 38 nM averaged
over eight cells.
When the optic tectum slice was incubated with the AMPA-R antagonist, CNQX, the
addition of glutamate resulted in a slight elevated fluorescence intensity compared to a saline
control reaching a maximum intensity of 1.12 AF/F (Fig 5). Calcium concentration increased
from 100 +/- 44 nM to 160 +- 76 nM averaged over 18 cells from two independent experiments.
Discussion
In this study, I have provided evidence that the neural progenitors of the PVZ express
functional ionotropic glutamate receptors. First, I demonstrated that the PVZ cells respond to
glutamate through a 3-fold increase in intracellular calcium. Second, I found that the selective
antagonists, APV and CNQX blocked this elevated calcium response. Because APV and CNOX
specifically block NMDA-R and AMPA-R respectively, the cells in the PVZ contain both types
of receptors.
