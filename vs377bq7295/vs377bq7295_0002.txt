Abstract
The periventricular zone (PVZ) of the adult zebrafish central nervous system contains
undifferentiated, proliferating cells consistent with the properties of neural progenitors. Past
studies suggest that axonal projections may extend from the optic tectal neurons into the PVZ
allowing for the possibility that the optic tectal neurons signal the PVZ with neurotransmitters,
In this study, time-lapse confocal imaging of PVZ cells labeled with fluo-4 AM calcium
indicator is employed to demonstrate that PVZ cells respond to glutamate through elevated
intracellular calcium levels. The NMDA receptor antagonist, APV, and the AMPA receptor
antagonist, CNQX, block this response. PVZ cells appear to express functional AMPA and
NMDA receptors, and these receptors may play an important role in proliferation, migration, or
differentiation of the PVZ cells.
Introduction
Neural progenitors are immortal cell lines capable of differentiating into mature neural
tissue. Considerable amounts of research are devoted to the study of neural progenitor cells in
order to elucidate the mechanism of neural regeneration as well as to develop treatments for
neural degenerative disorders. Zebrafish (Danio Rario) are advantageous model organisms for
such research because they generate new neurons throughout their adult lives and thus are
presumed to posses neural progenitors (Thompson, unpublished data).
Past studies indicate that the round cells of the periventricular zone (PVZ) in the optic
tectum of adult zebrafish may be such progenitor cells. These cells have been shown to
proliferate both in-vivo and in culture (Tulloch, 2002; Webster, 2002).
While the morphology of the PVZ cells has been well characterized, little is known about
signaling and activation of these cells. There are indications that axonal projections extend from
