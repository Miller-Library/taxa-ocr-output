minute wash with either Hanks or Hanks plus the glutamate receptor antagonists APV (100 uM)
or CNQX (100 uM).
Confocal Microscopy. Time-lapse confocal images were taken of optic tectum slices using an
Olympus microscope with a 40x water-immersion objective. Äfter the first ten frames, 1 ml of
Hanks, followed by 1 ml of 10 uM glutamate, or 1 ml of Hanks, followed by 1 ml of 10 uM
ionomcyin was added to the profusion dish containing the optic tectum slice. lonomycin is a
calcium sensitive ionophore and was used to determine the saturation point for the fluo-4 AM
indicator. Images were taken for a total of 120 frames, with approximately two seconds between
each frame.
Fluorescence analysis. Äfter imaging, six to ten regions of interest were sampled for
fluorescence intensity vs. time. Baseline fluorescence, Fo, was defined as the average
fluorescence over the first 10 frames. Fluorescence was averaged over 5 pixels and converted to
units of AF/Fo. Fluorescence intensities were converted to calcium concentration (nM) from the
following equation:
Ca2 - Ka' (F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F)
Kq, the dissociation constant for fluo-4 AM, was 345 nM. Fmax was given by the response to
ionomcyin and was set to 1.6. Fmin was set to 0.826 so that an F value of 1 gives a calcium
concentration of 100 nM.
Results
The optic tectum slices were fully saturated with fluo-4 AM indicator after incubation for
one hour (Fig. 1), however, a forty minute incubation was sufficient for confocal imaging. The
indicator stained only the edge of the tectum and the periventricular zone closet to the edge.
