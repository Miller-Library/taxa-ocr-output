the optic tectum into the PVZ permitting the possibility that optic tectum neurons interact
synaptically with the PVZ cells (Arakaki, unpublished data).
Synaptic interaction between neurons is crucial for proper CNS function. It is unknown,
however, whether synaptic interaction between neurons and neural progenitors exists, and
whether such interaction is necessary for neural progenitor activation and differentiation.
This study addresses the question; do PVZ cells respond to the neurotransmitter,
glutamate, through NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors? Glutamate signaling acting
on both NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) and AMPA receptors (AMPA-R) has been shown
necessary for proper development of dendritic arbors in Xenopus optic tectal neurons (Rajan &
Cline, 1998). A similar mechanism may operate in the signaling of PVZ cells in zebrafish.
In this study, time-lapse confocal images were taken of living optic tectum slices during
the application of glutamate and glutamate receptor antagonists. These images were analyzed for
increased intracellular calcium concentration using the fluorescent indicator, fluo-4 AM. An
elevated intracellular calcium concentration is indicative of a response to glutamate because both
AMPA-R and NMDA-R generate a rise in intracellular calcium.
I find that the PVZ cells respond to glutamate through elevated intracellular calcium
levels. This response is blocked by the selective NMDA-R antagonist, APV, and by the selective
AMPA-R antagonist, CNOX.
