Conclusion
Using time-lapse confocal imaging, this study demonstrated that the PVZ cells considered to be
neural progenitors respond to glutamate through elevated calcium levels. The antagonists, APV
and CNQX, blocked this response, indicating that the PVZ cells express functional NMDA- and
AMPA-receptors. The ionotropic glutamate receptors thus appear to be involved in cell
signaling in the PVZ, however it is still unknown whether these receptors are directly involved in
proliferation, migration, or differentiation, three critical features of progenitor cells.
