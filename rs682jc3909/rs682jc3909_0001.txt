ABSTRACT
Many marine organisms posses a multitoxin, or multixenobiotic, defense
mechanism that enables their cells to resist the effects of a variety of environmental
pollutants. A membrane transport protein similar to the multidrug resistance protein
(MDR) in human tumor cells pumps moderately hydrophobic compounds out of the cell
membrane, thus conferring a multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) to cells. One particular
strain of marine bacteria isolated from the digestive gland of the mussel Mytilus
californianus produces or contains compounds that are potential substrates of the MXR
protein in mussel gill tissue. Substances produced by this strain increased the level of
rhodamine accumulation in gill tissue and reduced the rate of rhodamine efflux when
compared with a marine broth control. This strain was isolated separately from two
different mussels collected more than seven weeks apart, indicating that it is endogenous
to the mussel gut, either as a regularly ingested dietary bacteria or as a digestive
symbiont. The presence of the strain in the mussel digestive gland and its high affinity
for MXR suggests a possible evolutionary function for the MXR transporter may be to
protect against potential toxins that the mussel encounters during the digestive process.
