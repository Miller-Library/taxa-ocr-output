supernatant, the majority of the substance may remain concentrated inside the bacteria
itself. When the bacteria are lysed upon homogenization, centrifugation or exposure to
methanol, the lysed bacteria as well as their concentrated internal products would end up
in the pellet fraction. The extraction processes may be analogous to the digestive process
in vivo, for mussels synthesize a variety of digestive carbohydrases, lipases, esterases and
phosphatases that have the ability to lyse and assimilate ingested bacteria (Gosling 1992).
Mussels are therefore likely to encounter even those toxic products that are entirely
contained within an ingested bacterium.
The fact that the HP2 and DN2 bacteria were isolated from two distinct mussels
collected seven weeks apart indicates that the strain is persistent in the mussel digestive
gland, either as a regularly ingested component of the diet or as a permanent symbiont.
Related studies have isolated and identified a variety of potentially pathogenic symbiotic
bacteria from the digestive gland, gills, primary ducts, kidney, and gill ciliates of the
Spanish mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Villabla, et. al. 1997). Regardless of the
source of the bacteria, however, the production of potential MXR substrates by a
persistent bacterial strain indicates that a natural function of MXR may be to enable the
mussel to reap the nutritive benefits from bacteria without being harmed by their
potentially toxic byproducts. Studies on the function of MXR in the sediment-dwelling
worm Urechis caupo have reached similar conclusions; marine bacteria isolated from the
wormâ€™s intestine were found to produce moderately hydrophobic compounds that were
substrates of the P-glycoprotein (Toomey, et. al. 1996). Analogously, the presence of the
HP2/DN2 bacteria in the digestive gland of Mytilus californianus may be part of the
reason for the concentration of MXR protein that is found there.
