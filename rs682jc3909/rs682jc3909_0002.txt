INTRODUCTION
The ability of many marine organisms to survive in habitats containing an
abundance of both natural and man-made toxins has raised research interest concerning
the mechanisms by which these organisms resist or tolerate environmental contaminants.
Recent studies have indicated that several marine invertebrates achieve this resilience
through what has been termed a multitoxin, or multixenobiotic, defense mechanism that
enables cells to resist the affects of a variety of environmental pollutants (Cornwall, et. al.
1995; Epel 1998; Eufemia and Epel 1998; Toomey and Epel 1993). A membrane
transport protein uses the energy of ATP to pump moderately hydrophobic compounds
out of the cell, thus conferring a multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) to cells. These
transport proteins were initially characterized in human tumor cells, where a 170 Kda
protein, P-glycoprotein, confers a multidrug resistance (MDR) to a variety of anti-cancer
drugs, relating study of the MXR system in marine invertebrates to medical oncological
research on cancer treatment (Toomey, et. al. 1996).
Research has indicated that, for many marine invertebrates, the MXR protein may
function as a first line of defense against environmental contaminants. The MXR protein
has been previously characterized in mussel gill tissue because of its ability to defend the
organism against man-made toxins such as many moderately hydrophobic pesticides
(Cornwall, et. al. 1995). This is unlikely, however, to be the original function of the
protein in a natural environment. Related research on human cell lines reveals specific
localization of the MDR protein to the apical surface of epithelial cells lining many
human digestive organs, including the liver, pancreas, kidney, jejunum, and colon
(Thiebaut, et. al. 1987). These studies suggest that the protein has a role in the normal
digestive secretion of waste metabolites into bile and urine for excretion. The presence of
