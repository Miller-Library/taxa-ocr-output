respective petri plate to a 0.5 ml cuvette. This procedure was repeated in triplicate for
each solution at each time point. The relative fluorescence of each solution was measured
using a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (EX = 550 nm, EM = 580 nm),
which had been previously zeroed with 500 ul of FSW.
Isolation of Genomic DNA
The genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from clonal colonies of the various
strains of bacteria isolated from the mussel digestive gland using the RapidPrep Micro
Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). This kit employs the use of individual
ready-made resin-packed columns to purify the DNA from 2 x 10° microbial cells
(approximately 1 ml of overnight culture). The DNA was eluted in 400 ul of elution
buffer, precipitated from this suspension with addition of 320 ul of 80% isopropanol, and
finally collected by centrifugation. The gDNA pellet isolated from each sample was re-
suspended in 20 ul of double deionized H2O and stored at 4°C.
RAPD PCR Analysis
The genomic differences between the various strains of bacteria isolated from the
digestive gland was investigated using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis
(RAPD). This technique detects genomic polymorphisms by using short oligonucleotide
primers (7 to 15 bp) of random sequence to initiate the polymerase chain reaction,
generating a fingerprint of amplification products specific to the strain in question.
"Ready to Go" RAPD Analysis Beads (Pharmacia Biotech) were used to
implement the RAPD analysis. These premanufactured beads contain all the reagents
needed for the reaction, with the exception of the primers, which were purchased
