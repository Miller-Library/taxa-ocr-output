• 1 uM rhodamine + 10 ul marine broth extract + 5 ml FSW (marine broth control)
• 1 uM rhodamine + 10 ul extract + 5 ml FSW (separate plate for each extract tested)
Verapamil, a known inhibitor of the MXR protein, served as a positive control for the
experiment; the marine broth extract served as a negative control.
5-6 pieces of gill tissue were placed in each petri plate. The petri plates were then
placed on an orbital shaker to shake at 15°C for one hour. The tissue pieces were
removed from the dye solutions and washed by swirling tissues in 30 ml FSW for 30
seconds. The pieces were then placed onto microscope slides and viewed at 10x
magnification under the fluorescence microscope. Tissues were viewed and
photographed with the Image-1 analysis system within 5 minutes of their removal from
the dye solutions.
Rhodamine B Efflux Assay
While the rhodamine accumulation assay tests for a modification in MXR activity
resulting from the presence of bacterial extract, it cannot differentiate between a
substance that increases the entry of rhodamine B into the cell, increasing dye
accumulation, and one that serves as a competitive substrate for the MXR protein, thereby
decreasing dye efflux. To distinguish between these scenarios, a rhodamine efflux assay
was employed on those samples that yielded positive results on the accumulation assay.
This assay measures the increase in extracelluar rhodamine fluorescence with
respect to time. Rhodamine B is added in excess to the cells and then removed from the
seawater. The accumulated dye is then pumped out of the cell by MXR, causing a
gradual (exponential) increase in rhodamine fluorescence of the surrounding media with
respect to time. If the bacterial extract contains a compound that is damaging to the cell
