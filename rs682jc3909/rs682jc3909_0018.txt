Fig. 8. Rhodamine Efflux Assay: DN4 pellet and supernatant extracts. Fluorescence
measured on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer zeroed with 500 ul FSW. Included are
rhodamine efflux curves from mussel gills incubated with (rhodamine only),
(+verapamil), (-DN4 pellet), and (+DN4 supernatant). Each time point was measured in
triplicate. Error bars represent standard errors from the three fluorometer readings at each
time point. Neither DN4 pellet nor DN4 supernatant exhibited a slower rate of efflux
than the rhodamine control.
Fig. 9. Rhodamine Efflux Assay: DN2 pellet. Fluorescence measured on a Perkin-
Elmer fluorometer zeroed with 500 ul FSW. Included are rhodamine efflux curves from
mussel gills incubated with (rhodamine only), (+verapamil), and (+DN2 pellet). Each
time point was measured in triplicate. Error bars represent standard errors from the three
readings at each time point. DN2 pellet exhibited a slower rate of efflux than the
rhodamine control
Fig. 10. Rhodamine Efflux Assay: HP2 pellet. Fluorescence measured on a Perkin-
Elmer fluorometer zeroed with 500 ul FSW. Included are rhodamine efflux curves from
mussel gills incubated with (rhodamine only), (+verapamil), and (+HP2 pellet). Each
time point was measured in triplicate. Error bars represent standard errors from the three
fluorometer readings at each time point. HP2 pellet exhibited a slower rate of efflux than
the rhodamine control.
