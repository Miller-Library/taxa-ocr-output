FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This study will continue during the next three months. One possible future
research direction would entail a chemical characterization of the identified bacterial
substrate for MXR transport protein. Ã–ther possibilities include investigating whether
exposure to increased concentrations of the substrate induce greater levels of MXR
expression in mussels, and whether similar substrates can be isolated from the human
digestive tract.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work would have never materialized had it not been for the insight and guidance of
Melissa Kaufman (for the help with bugs), Nancy Eufemia (for the help with mussels and
life), Chris Patton (for the technical help) and David Epel (for taking me into his lab).
Thank you all.
