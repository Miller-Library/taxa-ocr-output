Rhodamine Accumulation Assay
The rhodamine B accumulation assay was initially performed on the supernatant
and pellet extracts of all four bacterial strains to screen for potential substrates (Figure 1).
The level of fluorescence in gill tissues exposed to each extract was compared with the
fluorescence in an extract of marine broth, which served as a negative control for the
experiment. Verapamil, a known inhibitor of the MXR protein, served as a positive
control. Gill tissues incubated with verapamil showed an average increase in rhodamine
fluorescence of 75% above the control marine broth. Neither the HPI supernatant nor the
pellet showed an increase in fluorescence when compared with the control; the
supernatant showed an average fluorescence 22% below the control, and the pellet 18%
below. The HP4 and HPS supernatant extracts also did not display substrate activity,
producing an average fluorescence 3% and 12% below the control, respectively. These
strains were not subject to further investigation. The HP4 and HPS pellets showed
approximately equal increases in fluorescence; both extracts produced average increases
of 10-15% above the control. The HP2 pellet demonstrated the most dramatic increase,
showing an average fluorescence 28% greater than the control, accompanied by a small
5% increase from the HP2 supernatant. Although the HP2, HP4, HPS pellet extracts and
the HP2 supernatant extract all demonstrated relative increases in rhodamine
accumulation, only the HP2 and HPS pellet extracts demonstrated statistically significant
increases in fluorescence at the p = 0.05 level.
