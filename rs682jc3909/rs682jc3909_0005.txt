broth resulted in the greatest amount of salt precipitation. These solutions were left
undisturbed for 30 minutes to allow for precipitation of salts. The supernatants were
collected and the methanol was evaporated from each solution under vaccuum. The
remaining compounds were extracted into 2 ml ethanol and stored in sterile Eppendorf
tubes at -25°C. An extract of 5 ml marine broth served as a control with each set of
bacterial extracts. Extracts were tested within 12 hours of production to minimize loss of
activity.
Rhodamine B Accumulation Assay
The effect of bacterial extracts on the activity of the MXR protein was measured
using a rhodamine B accumulation assay in which mussel gills are exposed to rhodamine
B, a fluorescent dye that diffuses readily across the cell membrane and is then effluxed by
MXR protein. A relative increase in the level of intracellular fluorescence due to
increased accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence of the bacterial extract, (as
compared to a marine broth control), indicates that a substance in the bacterial extract
affects the action of the protein by serving as either a substrate for or an inhibitor of
MXR.
Gill tissue was dissected from the mussel and incubated in filtered sea water
(FSW) on ice. Forceps were used to remove excess mucus from the gills. Small
(-25mm*) pieces were cut from the dorsal edges of each gill. To test various extracts for
MXR substrate/inhibitor activity, the following solutions were set up in 10 mm petri
plates (Falcon 1008):
• 1 uM rhodamine + 5 ml FSW (rhodamine control)
• 1 uM rhodamine + 20 uM verapamil + 5 ml FSW (verapamil control)
