Fig. 1. Rhodamine Accumulation Data: Fluorescence of gill tissues exposed to pellet
and supernatant extracts of HPl, HP2, HP4, and HPS bacterial strains as compared with a
marine broth control extract. Figure includes data pooled from three separate rhodamine
accumulation assays. All fluorescence levels are expressed as a percentage of the 100%
marine broth control. Error bars represent the standard error between the three
experiments. (**) denotes statistical significance at the p-0.05 level.
Fig. 2. Agarose Gel: RAPD PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from HP1, HP2,
HP4, and HPS bacterial strains. No two lanes produced significantly similar banding
patterns.
Fig. 3. Agarose Gel: RAPD PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from HP2, HP4,
DN2, and DN4 bacterial strains. Note similarity between lanes 5 and 6, which contain
strains HP2 and DN2, respectively.
Fig. 4. Agarose Gel: RAPD PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from DN2 and HP2
bacterial strains. Note similarity between lanes 4 and 5, which contain strains HP2 and
DN2, respectively.
