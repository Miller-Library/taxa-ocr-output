Second Isolation of Digestive Bacteria
The four most predominant bacterial colonies were isolated from the digestive
tract homogenate of a second mussel dissected May 5, 1998 and labeled DNI, DN2,
DN4, and DN5.
Phenotypic Description and Relative Abundance
(f out of a total 183 colonies present on 50 ul plate)
DNI - large, white w/orange center (48 colonies)
DN2 - small, white w/orange center (96 colonies)
DN4 - small, white rimmed, clear in middle (12 colonies)
DN5- v. small bright orange (8 colonies)
RAPD Analysis
A RAPD PCR analysis was carried out on genomic DNA isolates from HP1, HP2,
HP4, HPS and the results visualized on a 2% agarose gel (Figure 2). Visual comparison
of the banding patterns produced by each primer revealed no similarity between any of
the four strains.
A second set of genomic DNA isolates from HP2, HP4, DN2, and DN4 were also
analyzed using RAPD PCR and visualized on an agarose gel (Figure 3). Comparing the
banding patterns created by primer 2 (the most accurate primer as recommended by the
manufacturer) revealed a strong similarity between lanes 9 and 10, which contained DNA
from HP2 and DN2, respectively.
The gel was repeated using primer 2 alone with only HP2 and DN2 samples
(Figure 4). HP2 and DN2 exhibit identical banding patterns, as illustrated by lanes 4 and
