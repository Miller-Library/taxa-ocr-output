membrane, rhodamine fluorescence will increase very rapidly. Alternatively, a bacterial
extract containing a substrate of the MXR transporter that binds competitively to the
MXR protein or competes with the protein will cause the extracellular level of rhodamine
fluorescence to increase at a much slower rate, closer to that exhibited by verapamil, a
known inhibitor of MXR.
All four gill tissues were removed from a mussel, cut in half, and placed on ice in
filtered sea water. The eight resulting pieces of tissue were each placed in a separate 10
mm petri plate filled with FSW. This process was repeated with as many mussels as
solutions being tested, (including controls), yielding separate groups of gill tissue, each
containing one gill piece from each organism.
A solution of luM rhodamine in FSW was prepared using the 1 mM stock
solution. This new solution was stored in the dark. The groups of gill tissue created
above were removed from the FSW and transferred to 15mm petri plates each containing
25 ml of the luM rhodamine solution. The plates were placed on the orbital shaker to
shake in the dark for 1 hour at 15°C.
After removal from the orbital shaker, the rhodamine solution was aspirated from
the plates, and each plate was rinsed with 30 ml FSW for 30 seconds. The FSW was then
removed by aspiration and replaced by one of the following solutions:
• 30 ml FSW (rhodamine control)
30 ml FSW + 20 uM verapamil (verapamil control)
30 ml FSW + 60 ul marine broth extract (marine broth control)
• 30 ml FSW + 60 ul extract (one solution for each extract to be tested)
The plates were replaced on the orbital shaker in the dark at 15°. At 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
and 60 minutes after adding the solutions, 500 ul of each solution was transferred from its
