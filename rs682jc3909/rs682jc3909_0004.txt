METHODS
Isolation of Digestive Bacteria
The studies were conducted using bacterial samples isolated from the digestive
tract of the mussel, Mytilus californianus. The mussels were collected from the rocky
intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station. A half inch portion of the digestive gland was
extracted from the dissected mussel and Dounce homogenized in one ml sterile seawater.
One, 10, 50, and 100 ul aliquots of this homogenate were plated onto marine agar plates
that were then incubated at 15°C for 5-6 days. The bacterial strains on each plate were
phenotypically compared and recorded. The four most common strains were selected and
streaked onto fresh marine agar plates to isolate individual colonies. These plates were
stored at 4°C for further use.
Extraction of Digestive Bacteria
Extracts were made both from the pellet (to isolate internal compounds that would
be released upon death of the bacteria), as well as from the supernatant (to isolate soluble
compounds excreted by the bacteria).
5 ml cultures of marine broth were each inoculated with a single bacterial colony
and incubated at 15°C for 2-5 days. The cultures were then removed from incubation and
centrifuged at 1400 x g for 15 minutes. The supernatants from each culture were
removed and transferred to sterile 15 ml test tubes. The pellets were each resuspended in
1 ml methanol, which were then also transferred to sterile 15 ml test tubes. Methanol was
added to the tubes to produce a 60:40 ratio of methanol: solute.] (In this case, this
amounted to 5 ml supernatant:7.5 ml methanol and 1 ml pellet:2.5 ml methanol) This
ratio was selected after repeated trials revealed that a 60:40 ratio of methanol:marine
