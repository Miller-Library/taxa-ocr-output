Fig. 5. Rhodamine Efflux Assay: HP2 pellet and supernatant extracts. Fluorescence
measured on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer zeroed with 500 ul FSW. Included are
rhodamine efflux curves from mussel gills incubated with (rhodamine only),
(+verapamil), (-HP2 pellet), and (-HP2 supernatant). Each time point was measured in
triplicate. Error bars represent standard errors from the three fluorometer readings at each
time point. HP2 pellet exhibited a slower rate of efflux than the rhodamine control; HP2
supernatant did not.
Fig. 6. Rhodamine Efflux Assay: HP4 pellet and supernatant extracts. Fluorescence
measured on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer zeroed with 500 ul FSW. Included are
rhodamine efflux curves from mussel gills incubated with (rhodamine only),
(+verapamil), (-HP4 pellet), and (-HP4 supernatant). Each time point was measured in
triplicate. Error bars represent standard errors from the three fluorometer readings at each
time point. Neither HP4 pellet nor HP4 supernatant exhibited a slower rate of efflux than
the rhodamine control.
Fig. 7. Rhodamine Efflux Assay: DN2 pellet and supernatant extracts. Fluorescence
measured on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer zeroed with 500 ul FSW. Included are
rhodamine efflux curves from mussel gills incubated with (rhodamine only),
(+verapamil), (-DN2 pellet), and (-DN2 supernatant). Each time point was measured in
triplicate. Error bars represent standard errors from the three fluorometer readings at each
time point. DN2 pellet exhibited a slower rate of efflux than the rhodamine control;
DN2 supernatant did not.
