the MXR protein in the digestive tract of the filter feeding mussel Mytilus californianus
indicates that the protein may serve an analogous function in mussels by protecting the
organism from toxic products encountered during its natural digestive process.
Mussels acquire nutrients by using mucociliary mechanisms on the ctendia and
labial palps to filter and ingest an array of suspended particles including phytoplankton,
detritus, and bacteria (Gosling 1992). While phytoplankton and other detrital organics
generally comprise the main sources of nutrition, free floating and bound bacteria are
estimated to collectively comprise up to 73% of the musselâ€™s metabolic requirements for
nitrogen and up to 30% of the metabolic requirements for carbon, making bacteria a
significant and essential component of the Mytilus diet (Gosling 1992). The mussels may
also harbor symbiotic bacteria in their digestive tract that, in competition for space and
nutrients, engage in a sort of chemical warfare with each other through secretion of toxic
or noxious substances. By undergoing regular dietary exposure to bacteria and bacterial
products, Mytilus may be subject to these potentially toxic chemical byproducts.
Resistance to accumulation of such dietary or symbiotic bacterial toxins is hypothesized
to be one of the primary functions of the MXR protein.
This research project investigates the evolutionary role of the MXR transport
protein in the digestive tract of mussels. I hypothesize that symbiotic or ingested bacteria
in the digestive tracts of the mussel Mytilus californianus produce or contain secondary
metabolites that may be toxic and that these products are also substrates of the MXR
transporter.
