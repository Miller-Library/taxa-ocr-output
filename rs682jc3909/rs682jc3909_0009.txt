separately (Pharmacia Biotech). To prepare the samples for RAPD analysis, one bead
was placed in each sterile PCR tube with 5 ul of the primer to be used. 2 ul of genomic
DNA was added to each tube and brought up to a total volume of 25 ul with addition of
sterile sea water. Each trial included a control without primer. The samples were run
using a Perkin Elmer thermal cycler. When the reaction was complete, 3 ul sample buffer
was added to each PCR tube, and 10 ul of each sample was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel.
Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, viewed under ultraviolet light, and the band
patterns compared using the ratio of common bands to the total number of bands.
RESULTS
Isolation of Digestive Bacteria
The four most predominant bacterial strains were isolated from the digestive
gland homogenate of a mussel dissected March 28, 1998. These strains were designated
HPl, HP2, HP4, and HPS. While HP4 and HP5 bore phenotypic resemblance to each
other, HPI and HP2 were phenotypically distinct, both from each other and from HP4 and
HPS.
Phenotypic Description
HPI - large, white, opaque
HP2 - small, white w/orange center
HP4/HP5 - small, translucent
