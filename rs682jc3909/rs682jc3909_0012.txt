5, respectively. Ratio of similarity between lanes 4 and 5 = 3 bands in common/3 total
bands =1.
Efflux Assays
Efflux assays were initially conducted on both pellet and supernatant extracts of
the HP2, DN2, HP4, and DN4 bacterial strains (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8). When the rates of
efflux of these extracts were compared to those exhibited by rhodamine and verapamil,
only the extracts of the DN2 and HP2 pellets consistently showed efflux rates below that
of rhodamine. These two extracts were subject to further individual testing, upon which
they continued to exhibit efflux rates between those of rhodamine and verapamil.
(Figures 9, 10) In all cases, the marine broth control exhibited an efflux rate
approximately equal to or higher than that of rhodamine (Data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The original aim of this study was to identify potential bacterial substrates for the
MXR protein in Mytilus californianus. To achieve this goal, several extracts of bacterial
strains isolated from the mussel digestive gland were screened for their level of
interaction with the MXR protein using both the rhodamine B accumulation and efflux
assays. The HP2 and DN2 pellet extracts were the only extracts to show potential
substrate activity, both in the accumulation assay (for HP2) and the efflux assay (for
both), indicating that these two bacteria contain products that serve either as substrates or
inhibitors of the MXR protein. The close similarity in the banding pattern between HP2
and DN2 observed on the agarose gel (Figure 4), as well as the similar morphology
between the plated colonies, indicate that HP2 and DN2 are in fact identical bacterial
