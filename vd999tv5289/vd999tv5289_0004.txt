weighed and then cleaned by acetonitrile partitioning
followed by elution with 6% diethyl ether through a
florisil column (7). The resulting mixture of pesticides
and PCB's was evaluated by gas liquid chromatography
for the approximate DDE content and an aliquot containing
no more than 20 ug was concentrated down to 5 ml. for
separation. This involved elution by petroleum ether
through a column packed with specially treated silicic
acid following the method of Armour and Burke (8). POB
residues are eluted with the first 250 ml. of runoff
DDE and other pesticide residues remain in the column and
can later be recovered using a methylene chloride-hexaneÂ¬
acetonitrile mixture (80-19-1). As some difficulty in
separation was frequently encountered, the last 30 ml.
of petroleum ether eluate was collected in 10 ml. fractions
and tested for early DDE runoff before it was added back
to the original 220 ml. All eluates were concentrated to
appropriate levels for analysis by gas liquid chromatography
employing identical equipment and operating conditions
used by Rote and Murphy (6). Peak area was measured by an
automatic disc integrator and quantitated according to
detector response.
In order to adjust for variations in machine sensitivity,
standards of Aroclor 1232 and 1260 were injected soon before
or after the samples. The total peak area in in/ng from
these two standards was plotted semi-logarithmically against
2/6
