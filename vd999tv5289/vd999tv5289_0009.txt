C
are not as easily transported to remote areas as are DDI
residues and thus the DDT/PCB ratio tends to be lower the
closer one comes to industrial centers. Findings reported
here do not contirm this hypothesis. Both the Pajaro
River and Elkhorn Slough are near relatively little
yet DDT/POB ratios were is general found to be
industr
as low or lower than values reported from industrialized
areas.
In contrast to these findings are the DDT/PCB ratios
found in the liver samples of the leopard sharks. All
three samples have ratios over 1.0 with a mean of 2.91.
T/POB ratios in the flesh of the same specimens, however,
were comparable to those found in the other tissue samples.
As an explanation for this phenomenon, perhaps the
exceptionally high levels of DDT residues concentrated in
the liver tissue affect POB storage such that the DDT/PCB
ratio becomes considerably higher than would otherwise
be expected. This view is substantiated by the absolute
residue concentrations found in the lipid of these samples
which, because of the high fat content of liver tissue,
gives a better relative measure of the residue levels.
Using these values, both PCB and DDT levels in the shark
flesh are seen to be similar to the levels found in the
flesh samples from the other fishes taken from Elkhorn
Slough (Fig. 5). In the liver tissue, however, DDT is far
more concentrated than in any of the other fish samples
