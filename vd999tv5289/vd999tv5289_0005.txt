O
the average number of chlorine atoms per molecule in the
mixture. This average is known from the Aroclor number:
1232 contains 32% chlorine by weight or an average of two
chlorines per molecule; 1260 contains 60% chlorine by weight
or an average of six chlorines per molecule. A straight
line was drawn through these two points from which
detector response levels for any given isomer with a known
number of chlorine atoms could be determined. Chlorine
content of specific isomers was determined whenever
possible by comparison with the mass spectometry work
of other investigators (4,9,10). Peaks not previously
identified were assumed to contain the same number of
chlorines as peaks having approximately the same retention
time. Each isomer found in a chromatogram was quantified
individually and summed to obtain a value for total PCB
content.
RESULTS
A total of thirty-nine different peaks were resolved
in
ifteen samples. Thirty-two of these correspond to
those identified by Rote and Murphy in their analysis of
Aroclor standards and were numbered identically 1 to 32 (6).
Seven additional peaks were detected and designated by the
number of the peak preceding it plus a letter. Five of these
peaks (7A, 9A, 19A, 27A, 27B) had retention times between
two POB compounds with equal numbers of chlorine atoms and
were evaluated by using the response curve value appropriate
for the two surrounding isomers. Peak 31A was located
