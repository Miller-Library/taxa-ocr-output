chlorination. In order to judge the relative amounts of
each group accounting for the total POB's, each is listed
in Table III in percentage of total POB content. Further
analysis, made by adding up the percentages of mono, di,
and trichlorobiphenyls present in the sample fishes from
the Pajaro River show the slight inverse relationship to
the idealized trophic levels of the fishes shown in Fig. 4.
Samples run on shiner perch roe from Elkhorn Slough
and on top smelt eggs from the Pajaro River show opposite
trends for the initial residue levels passed on by these
species to their young. Both POB's and DDT were concentrated
over 2-fold in the shiner perch roe compared to the levels
found in the adult flesh while both were present in only
one-half the concentration of the adult flesh in top smelt
eggs.
Particularly interesting are the results on the three
leopard shark livers and two flesh samples. All livers
show higher levels of DDT than POB's with a ratio averaging
2.91. In contrast, flesh samples from the same sharks
show DDT/POB ratios approximating those values found in all
other samples where either whole fish or flesh was analyzed,
Absolute values for DDT and POB residues (ppm in lipid) in
the shark livers, shark flesh, and the average of the three
other flesh samples from Elkhorn Slough are shown in Fig. 5.
The breakdown of the total DDT residue levels into DDE,
DDD, and DDT percentages is found in Table IV.
