Since 1967, when polychlorinated biphenyls (POB's
were first identified in animal residues (1,2), there
increasing concern about PCB concentrations in
has bee
the environment. Efforts to measure these concentrations
have been considerably complicated by the complex nature
of POB's, which are not a single group of analogs but a
series of isomers with varying degrees of chlorination
Until recently, quantification of POB's using gas
liquid chromatography has been made by assuming identical
response of the electron-capture detector for all isomers
and using either p,p'-DDE (3) or commercial PCB mixtures
(Aroclors) as standards (4,5). Rote and Murphy (6),
showed that the detector response varies according to
the degree of chlorination of the individual isomer. By
semi-logarithmically plotting the total ine/ng from the
chromatograms of six different Aroclors against their
average chlorine content they formulated a response
curve from which the absolute values of specific POB
isomers can be estimated. Using this technique, POB
