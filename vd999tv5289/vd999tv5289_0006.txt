between a nonachlorobiphenyl and a decachlorobiphenyl.
Since only one decachlorobiphenyl isomer is possible it
was evaluated as having nine chlorine atoms. The degree
of chlorination of the compound corresponding to peak 32A
could not be inferred from its retention time and was
not included in total POB content. Retention times
relative to p,p'-DDE and the known or approximate degree
of chlorination for each isomer are given in Table I.
Results calculated in total PCB and total DDT residue
content in both fat and whole tissue are listed in Table II.
Fig. 2 compares the residue levels (ppm whole tissue weight)
found in the three species of fish that were sampled from
both rivers. Both POB and DDT levels strongly suggest
that fishes in the Pajaro are concentrating more
polychlorinated residues than the same fishes in Elkhorn
Slough, though this data become somewhat confused depending
on whether values referring to ppm of lipid or total tissue
weight are examined.
A rough correlation of residues in whole tissue weight
to the approximate trophic level on which the fishes from
the Pajaro River feed (11) is shown in Fig. 3. Except for
the high values found in the top smelt, a primary carnivore
the total PCB content shows a distinct upward trend while
the DDT values exhibit only minimal correlation.
After individual quantification, the POB isomers were
divided into ten groups according to their degree of
