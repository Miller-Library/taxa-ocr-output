DISCUSSION
Holmes (2), Risebrough Ã©t al (12), Koeman et al (4),
and Rote and Murphy (6) all found the higher chlorinated
POB's to be predominant in organisms high up in food
chains such as fish, sea birds, and a sea otter. Jensen et al
(13) and Koeman et al (4) both present evidence which
indicates that there is significant breakdown of the lower
chlorinated PCB's as they pass through biological systems.
Though lower chlorinated POB's were found in all samples
the trend shown in Fig. 4 indicates breakdown among these
compounds relative to the total POB content as one goes
from the primary carnivore (top smelt) to the tertiary
carnivores (striped bass and starry flounder). This
finding substantiates the evidence of Jensen and of Koeman.
DDT/POB ratios have been studied extensively by
Risebrough et al (14). Their findings showed a regional

fallout pattern in the DDT/PCB ratios with low values
between one and two being found in birds around San Francisco
Bay and increasingly higher ratios being found in birds
ogressively further from industrialization. DDT/POB
living pr
ratios from.4 to .8 have been recorded by Presst and
Jeffries in great crested grebes from the British Isles
(15). In marine animals along the west coast of Sweden
the DDT/POB ratios were found to be as low as .15 (13).
From these data Peakall and Lincer (16) suggest that POB's
