while POB content is slightly below those levels found
in either the tissue samples from the same sharks or any
of the other tissue samples from the Elkhorn Slough
fishes. A similar effect on dieldrin storage in fish and
rats has been shown to be caused by the presence of DDT
(17,18).
SUMMAR
Samples of fishes from the Pajaro River and Elkhorn
Slough were analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbon residues.
All DDT/POB ratios for flesh and whole fish samples were
less than 1.2 ; ratios were substantially greater than 1
in leopard shark liver samples. The possibility that the
high concentration of DDT stored in the liver tissue is
ic to POB storage is discussed. The percentage
antagonist:
of total POB content present in combined mono, di, and
trichlorobiphenyls for the five species taken from the
Pajaro River was found to exhibit a slight inverse
relationship to the idealized trophic levels on which these
fishes feed in accordance with findings by Jensen et al (13)
and Koeman et al (4) that breakdown occurs in the lower
chlorinated PCB's as they pass through biological system
POB's more than DDT levels tended to increase in these same
five fishes as one moved up this simplified fraction of a
food chain. Samples from the Pajaro River were compared
to the same species captured in Elkhorn Slough and found
to have significantly greater PCB and DDT concentrations.
