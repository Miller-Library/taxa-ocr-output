levels were determined in fishes from Elkhorn Slough and
the Pajaro River, California. DDE, DDD, and DDT residues
were also quantified and their combined values compared
to the total POB content.
METHODS
Elkhorn Slough and the Pajaro River both drain
agricultural lands in the Monterey Bay area. They
empty into Monterey Bay near Moss Landing (Fig. 1) and
are both susceptable to considerable salt water intrusion
from the bay. Staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus),
shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata), and leopard sharks
(Tr
akis semifasciata) were seined and gill netted in
Elkhorn Slough at Kirby Park (A). A starry flounder
(Platichthys stellatus) was obtained from near the Moss
Landing marina (B). All fishes from the Pajaro River
including top smelt (Atherinop:
finis), and striped bass
(Roccus saxatilis) were gill netted about one mile from
the mough (C).
Samples were either dissected soon after capture or
frozen and stored until ready for analysis. Three liver
and two flesh samples were analyzed from the leopard
sharks; all other samples were single preparations of
flesh or whole fish. Tissues were digested in a
perchloric-glacial acetic acid mixture, extracted with
hexane, and evaporated to dryness. The fat residue was
