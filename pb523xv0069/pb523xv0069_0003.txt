There are only four theories that seem plausible as to
the exact method of locomotion in diatoms. These are as fol¬
lows (Fig. 2):
1) Mucilage secreted at the anterior terminal pore and
posterior central pore is driven by undulating actin.
The mucilage is forced out and against the substrate
by the actin. The mucilage then acts to push the
diatom along. (Jarosch, 1962)
2) Trails are secreted through the entire raphe and
expand upon leaving it. The secreted trail then pushes
along the substrate to force the diatom forward.
(Hopkins & Drum, 1966)
3) Trails are secreted from the anterior terminal pore
allowing for locomotion, and secretion on the dorsal
valve creates streaming. Streaming is the observation
of particles being moved along the dorsal raphe rapidly
back and forth. (Harper & Harper, 1967)
4) Capillary flow of a viscous liquid along the raphes
flows outward and becomes trails only at the anterior
central pore and posterior terminal pore. (Gordon &
111
Drum, 1970)
All of these theories cite secretion of some sort of muco¬
polysaccharide as the direct means of locomotion and claim the
presence of secreted trails on the substratum. Drum and Hopkins
(1965) also claimed actin-affecting drugs reacted on diatoms,
indicating that actin may also be involved.
