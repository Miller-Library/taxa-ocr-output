In this study I examined seven diatom species. I was
asking the question whether it is correct to assume that loco¬
motion is exactly the same in every diatom, i.e., whether one
theory suffices for all diatoms. To probe the possibilities
of locomotion in marine diatoms six approaches were used:
1) Morphological studies of diatom frustules.
2) Sensitivity of diatoms to ion changes in sea water.
3) Whether calcium, since it is linked to the secretory
mechanism of pulling vesicles to the cytoplasmic wall
for excretion, is linked to locomotion in diatoms.
Calcium-free water was used in this study.
4) The use of chemical additives for analysis for effects
on secreted trails.
5) Scanning electron microscopy with gentle fixation
methods to carefully analyze the raphe systems during
secretion and the secreted trails.
6) Observations of differences between species with
respect to their speeds and methods of movement in and
out of sea water mainstream flow.
In addition to analyzing the possible methods of locomo¬
tion for each of the seven species, I was able to observe the
coupling mechanism of the diatom Bacillaria Paradoxa. This
mechanism, which is a delicate extension of the silica frus¬
tule has never been observed before.
