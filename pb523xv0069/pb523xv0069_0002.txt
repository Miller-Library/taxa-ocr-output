INTRODUCTION
Diatoms are one of the most abundant plants in the world,
producing 25 to 30 percent of the world's oxygen. It seems
strange that a plant, so basic for our survival, is so
little understood. Moving about in beautiful glass houses,
they reach speeds quite fast relative to their size. The
mechanism for this locomotion is unknown, but it seems to be
unique to these little plants. Theories about how diatoms
locomote have been proposed for over one hundred years and
include ideas from jet propulsion to cytoplasmic capping.
All studies of locomotion now, though, seem to be coupled
to the unique morphology of the diatom frustule (Fig. 1). The
raphe system, gut into the silica frustule, is an integral
part of locomotion. Secretion of mucopolysaccarides are extru¬
ded along this channel and are one of the means by which the
diatoms move. The frustule, or shell, is made of silica and
divided into three parts—two valves and a girdle. The anal¬
ogy to a petri dish can closely be drawn to the frustule if the
two valves are compared to the upper (cover) and lower half of
a petri dish, one fitting into the other and the girdle being
a piece of tape surrounding the outer edges. The raphe sys¬
tem, which usually consists of a single linear channel opening
through to the cytoplasmic wall, is directly in the center of
each valve. Each raphe is then split in half by two central
pores, each ending in two terminal pores.
