Calcium-free sea water with E.G.T.A. The graph shows
definite differences between Bacillaria, Nitzschia
Longissima, and the two Eunotias. Left bar: time

Barium substituted for calcium showed significant
differences in sensitivity between Bacillaria, Pleuro¬
sigma, and Nitzschia Longissima. Barium substituted
for a finite period of time. Left bar:

Strontium substituted for calcium for a finite period
of time. Bacillaria deviated significantly from
Eunotia Caroline, Pleurosigma Elongatum, and Nitzschia

motion occurs. Right bar: recovery time.
