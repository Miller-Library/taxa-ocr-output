Calcium was substituted by either barium chloride or
strontium chloride, of concentrations equal to the calcium
chloride in the control solution. The base formula artificial
sea water was used in recovery, and the short-term techniques
of observing the diatoms were used. Both solutions were non¬
chelated.
I also observed diatoms placed in the artificial sea
water with a calcium ionophore added at a 10 uM concentration.
The calcium ionophore was dissolved in D.M.S.O. [1 ul/mll. A
control of artificial sea water with D.M.S.O. at the same con¬
centration was used. Observations were taken using both long¬
and short-term methods of solution changing.
The effectspof local anesthetic tetracaine were studied.
The anesthetic, a calcium blocker, was added to the sea water
at a concentration of 1 uM and .5 uM. Only the short-term
method of solution changing was used.
To determine whether microtubules were involved in
locomotion, cytochalasin D was applied to diatoms in a 10 uM
concentration. The cytochalasin was dissolved in D.M.S.O.
[1 ul/mll and a control of artificial sea water with D.M.S.O.
at the same concentration was used. Both long- and short-term
methods of solution changing were employed.
Two enzymes, pronase and hemicellulase, and a complex of
abalone entrails were tested on the diatoms to help determine
the structure of the diatom trail. All these chemicals were
dissolved directly in the artificial sea water at concentra¬
tions of .005 g/ml, .0l g/ml, and .001 g/ml, respectively.
