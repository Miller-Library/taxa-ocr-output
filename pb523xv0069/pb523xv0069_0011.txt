particles. The marine diatoms were placed on a cover¬
slip, allowed to locomote for one-half hour, and then
placed in 18 osmium tetroxide and 48 gluteraldehyde
fixative (osmolarity of 980) for one-half hour. They
were then transferred to sea water in a solution chang-
ing apparatus, designed by Bill Magruder, which very
slowly changes the osmolarity of the solutions. The
sea water was exchanged for distilled water over a
period of about seven hours. The distilled water was
then exchanged with acetone over approximately the same
period of time. The diatoms were then critical point
dried for two days.
3) The third method of fixation employed the same method
as t2 except the solution changes were stopped at the
distilled water point; no acetone was added. The dia¬
toms were then immersed in liquid nitrogen and all
liguids were sublimed off exactly as in method number
one.
4) The fourth method of fixation was used to observe the
morphology of the silica frustule. Marine diatoms
were centrifuged to concentrate them. They were then
acidified with a solution of concentrated sulfuric
and nitric acids for two days. After two days, they
were rinsed and centrifuged ten times with distilled
water. The water was removed by sublimation in a
vacuum device.
