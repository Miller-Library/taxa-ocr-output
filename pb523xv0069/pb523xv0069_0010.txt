glass slide on two sides by vaseline. In this manner an
even suction was created to pull water from under the cover¬
slip. The flow of sea water was varied by adjusting the height
of a gravity drip system attached by tubing to the other side
of the cover-slip. Flow speed was taken with an optical microme¬
ter and a stop watch while observing charcoal particle flow,
SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Four different methods of gentle fixation were used to
observe diatoms under the electron microscope:
1) A freeze drying method was used on fresh water diatoms,
the only type that would move in distilled water for
a prolonged period of time. The diatoms were trans¬
ferred to distilled water and allowed to locomote for
one-half hour before being placed in liquid nitrogen.
Distilled water was used to keep salt crystals from
forming during lyophilization, Äfter freezing on
cover-slips the diatoms were placed on a metal slab
which was half emersed in liquid nitrogen. The metal
slab was then placed in a vacuum and all liquids were
sublimed for approximately two days.
2) A second method of fixation was tried using osmium
tetroxide and gluteraldehyde in 18 and 48 solutions,
respectively. Two preparations of diatoms were made,
one with colloid charcoal particles and one without the
