ABSTRACT
Locomotion was studied in seven species of marine diatoms.
A scanning electron microscope was employed to observe frustule
morphology, secretion from the raphe system, and trails.
Active secretion may be involved in locomotion, but to varying
degrees in each species of diatom. It is also possible that
secreted trails are, for the most part, just a by-product of
locomotion in certain species.
Differences in sensitivity to the content of calcium of
sea water may indicate less direct use of secretion for locoÂ¬
motion in Nitzschia Longissima and Bacillaria Paradoxa. In
addition, drugs such as cytochalasin D and movement in sea
water flow seems to confirm the fact that microtubules are
not involved and that at least Navicula Vulpina and Nitzschia
Closterium use only their posterior portions of their raphe
systems during locomotion.
Wing-like extensions of the frustule used in coupling
colonial Bacillaria Paradoxa were observed for the first time.
