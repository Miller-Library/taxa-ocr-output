After all methods of fixation, the diatoms were coated
with gold and viewed using a Hitachi scanning electron
microscope.
RESULT!
Velocity of Diatoms: (Table 1)
In six of the seven species of diatoms I was able to
record speeds. Bacillaria Paradoxa, being colonial, moves the
whole colony at tremendous speeds relative to each individual,
making it almost impossible to record an individual speed.
The orders Eunotia and Bacillaria Paradoxa were most consis¬
tent, as the other orders tended to have more stop-and-go
motions. Pleurosigma Elongatum was by far the quickest, which
may be because of the extremely large raphe it possesses,
thereby allowing it a larger space for its locomotory mechan¬
ism.
Changes in the Ionic Content of Sea Water:
Calcium-free sea water with E.G.T.A. was introduced to
the diatoms because of calcium's probable relation to secre¬
tion (Fig. 3). Calcium has been cited as being needed for the
fibers that pull the secretory vesicles to the cytoplasmic
wall. Without calcium secretion stops. Cessation of motion
was recorded in all species except Nitzschia Longissima.
