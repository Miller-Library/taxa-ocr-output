MATERIALS AND METHODS
I selected seven species of diatoms in which to study
locomotion. They are as follows: Bacillaria Paradoxa,
Navicula Vulpina, Nitzschia Closterium, Eunotia Soleirolii,
Eunotia Carolina, Pleurosigma Elongatum, and Nitzschia
Longissima. These species were chosen because of their abun¬
dance in the populations sampled.
The marine diatoms used in the following experiments
were collected from the indoor salt water pumping system used
by the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California.
The fresh-water diatoms were collected from a nearby stream.
Some of the Nitzschia Longissima were cultured in the labora¬
tory. All diatoms were stored at approximately 20°C at normal
day and night intervals.
All experiments concerning the ionic content of the arti¬
ficial sea water used were repeated 30-65 times depending on
the consistencies of the results. Trials were done at least
30 times on each species. If those 30 results were within
958 of each other, the testing was stopped. No test went
longer than 65 times. Averages of all the trials were then
taken, and the results recorded. Observations were taken at
approximately the same time of day and for each of the seven
species separately.
When changing solutions, during ionic content studies,
three methods were employed:
