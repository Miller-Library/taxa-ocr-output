under a raised cover-slip while being observed through a
light microscope, or simply added to their solution.
The diatoms were observed in artificial sea water with
varied ionic contents. The base formula for this artificial
sea water, which was used as a control throughout the experi¬
ments, was: 47 millimoles Nacl, 1 millimoles KCl, 5 milli-
moles MgCl., 1 millimoles Cacl,, and 114 grams triss HCl as a
buffer. Distilled water was then added until 100 milliliters
was reached and triss base was added to bring the P.H. up to
7.8. The osmolarity was checked on each solution and kept at
980 milliosmoles.
Diatoms were first tested in chelated and unchelated
calcium-free sea water. The base formula for artificial sea
water was used omitting the calcium. E.G.T.A. at a 10 mM
concentration was incorporated in the chelated formula. The
cover-slip rinsing method was used at first in solution changes
until the effects were determined to be short termed. Disper-
sion under the cover-slip during visualization was then pre¬
ferred. The diatoms were viewed under 100x, 400x, and 1000x.
They were timed with a stop watch over 260 microns. The
microscope ocula were calibrated using an optical stage
micrometer and adjusted for each magnification. Cessation of
motion was determined to be complete when at least 908 of the
movement from a certain species had ceased. Once stopped I
attempted to induce recovery using the base formula artificial
sea water.
