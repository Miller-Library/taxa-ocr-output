and forth, attached only by their single posterior terminal
pore. When they did stop and adhered tightly, they would
attach their second anterior terminal pore.
S.E.M. Studies of Coupling in Bacillaria Paradoxa: (Figs. 23-35)
Delicate wing-like extensions of the frustules were observed
on Bacillaria Paradoxa when gentle fixation methods were employed.
Bacillaria move by sliding the large wing-extension of one
diatom into the smaller wing-channel of another. They use
only one of the two raphes on each valve to secrete on their
neighbor and thereby force themselves by. The quick oscilla¬
tions of one Bacillaria sliding past another are very similar
to particle streaming on a non-colonial type diatom. Similar
methods of contracting mucous through the raphe may, therefore,
be used. Bacillaria come to a stop very mechanically when
completely outstretched in the colony. A lip at the end of the
wing extension may explain the consistency of this stopping
mechanism. These extensions on Bacillaria Paradoxa are the
first ever observed. Two theories seem possible from the
evidence which includes a channel hook in which the wing exten¬
sion fits. They are diagrammed in Figs. 36 and 37. A lip on
the end of the wing extension appears to be the stopping
mechanism for their mechanical oscillations (Fig. 26).
