mechanism within the secretion. Simple recoil of outstretched
mucous could not explain the rapid reversing of direction dur¬
ing particle streaming. Since diatoms were affected by actin
inhibiting drugs and negatively by cytochalasin D, it seems
plausible that these fibers be actin.
Trails of secretion have been reported but in relatively
few species. No trails were even observed in the species I
looked at under the S.E.M. Instead, for the first time, secre¬
tions were seen adjacent to the raphes. They were rolled up
along the raphe or strung-out and fiber-like but never laid
upon the glass. These secretions were fiber-like in that
secreted material is usually distinctly globular or smooth
under the E.M. These secretions were much more rough and torn
as if they contained structural fibers. The fiber-like secre¬
tions that were seen were always attached to a particle.
A simple observation that seems to agree with the four
previous theories of locomotion is the action of diatoms in a
flow. Since Navicula Vulpina and Nitzschia Closterium swing
back and forth by their posterior terminal pore while moving
in a fairly slow flow, it seems to be correct to assume that
at least some diatoms are attached only by their posterior ter¬
minal pore and maybe their posterior central pore while mov¬
ing. When immobile, they seem to adhere at least with both
terminal pores.
The collection of data in this study indicates to me that
a new theory for locomotion in diatoms can be introduced. The
