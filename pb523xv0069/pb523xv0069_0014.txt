chloride substitution. All species had long-term sensitivity
to potassium-free sea water, again with differences between
the species. Bacillaria Paradoxa never completely stopped
moving even after two days.
Chemical Additives:
Of all the chemicals added to the sea water, only one,
abalone entrails, stopped movement and allowed recover
Cytochalasin D, which inhibits microtubules, had no effect as
did the calcium ionophore and hemicellulase (Table 2).
Scanning Electron Microscope Studies of Frustules and Secretions:
(Figs. 10-22)
The secretion, a mucopolysaccharide, coming from the
raphe systems expands as it leaves the raphe and probably comes
from all along the raphe and not just the pores (Figs. 10-16).
The absence of trails suggests a new theory of secretion in
relation to locomotion. The secretion, many times, also seems
to be filament-like, and not as globular as previously thought
(Figs. 10, 11, and 16)
Movement in Flow:
In flow most diatoms which tried to move lost adherence
and were swept away. The majority of diatoms would immediately
stop when the flow reached 89 microns/sec. Before stopping
the Navicula Vulpina and Nitzschia Closeterium would sway back
