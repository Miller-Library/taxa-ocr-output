Recovery was recorded using artificial sea water. Both the
long- and short-term methods of solution changes were used.
Two other ion substitutions were used to observe their
effects upon the diatoms. These were both sodium substitutions,
one using N-methyl glutamine at the same concentration as
sodium and the other lithium chloride at concentration equal
to the sodium chloride in the control solution. Recovery in
both cases was achieved using artificial sea water and short¬
and long-term solution changing methods.
Potassium-free sea water was also introduced to the dia¬
toms simply by leaving the KCl out while making the artificial
sea water. Osmolarity was held at 980 milliosmoles by remov¬
ing distilled water, and the base formula artificial sea water
was used for recovery. Observations were made with the long¬
term methods of solution changing.
Lastly, the effects of P.H. were examined. Triss HCl
and triss base were used in adjusting the P.H. P.H. was
recorded on an electronic meter. Four solutions (P.H. 6.5,
9.2, 6.0, and a control of 8.08) were used. Rinsing with the
control was employed to examine recovery in the diatoms.
The movements of the diatoms in a flow was observed under
a light microscope using a vacuum suction device. A .5 mm
diameter polyurethane tubing was attached to a small aquarium
vacuum pump. The free end of the tube was placed against a
small piece of tissue paper that extended part of the way
underneath a cover-slip. The cover-slip was raised on a
