1) For studies done longer than three hours the diatoms
were transferred from their holding container into a
petri dish with cover-slips resting on the bottom.
After a sufficient amount of time, which usually was
at least one-half hour, the diatoms adhered to the
cover-slips and were transferred via the cover-slips,
They then were rinsed in the new solutions fairly
vigorously and placed in their new solution as free
as possible from any previous liquid.
2) For cruder, long-term studies, diatoms were concentrated
in a single spot on tissue paper with the use of a
pipette and then dried and scraped off into the new
solution.
3) In order to visualize immediate effects of new solu¬
tions on diatoms, solution changes had to be made under
the cover-slip while viewing through a light micro¬
scope. I was able to accomplish this by putting the
diatoms in their original solution on a glass slide.
I then placed a cover-slip, raised on two sides by
vaseline, over them. By placing the new solution on
one side of the cover-slip I was able to "pull" it
through with tissue paper on the other side. This
method effectively allowed for complete changes of
solutions quickly and during visualization.
To observe particle streaming along the raphe of the dia¬
toms, a fine grain charcoal colloid suspension was diffused
