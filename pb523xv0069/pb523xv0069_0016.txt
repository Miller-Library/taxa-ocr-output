DISCUSSION
Of the seven species of diatoms used in studies of
sensitivity to changes in ionic content of sea water, each
species had its own specific response time. With calcium-free
water, in which the response time was relatively short, the
differences between the species of Bacillaria Paradoxa and
Nitzschia Longissima in sensitivity may be related to the role
secretion plays in locomotion. Calcium has been indicated to
be needed in the secretion process of bringing the vesicles
to the cytoplasmic walls. Without calcium secretion stops.
Since secretion, or the production and excretion of poly¬
mucosaccharides, should stop, the great length of time for
Bacillaria to cease movement and Nitzschia Longissima's in¬
sensitivity compared to the relatively quick response times of
the other species indicates production of polymucosaccharides
may play a less direct role in locomotion in some species than
in others. Changes in other ions may not be linked to the pro¬
duction of mucopolysaccharides or locomotion. These tests
show how diatoms are extremely sensitive to almost any ionic
changes which, therefore, may have partially masked the
calcium-free sea water experiment.
Since I have made observations of very quick particle
streaming, back and forth, across the dorsal raphe and even
the "reeling" in of particles from a distance up onto the raphe,
it seems essential that there be some sort of contractile
