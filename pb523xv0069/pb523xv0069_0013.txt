and Nitzschia Longissima were recorded in the time required to
stop and to recover.
Calcium-free sea water which was not chelated was also
used (Fig. 4). Significant differences between the species
Bacillaria Paradoxa and Nitzschia Longissima in their sensi¬
tivity to calcium-free water were recorded. Nitzschia
Longissima again being unsensitive. The unchelated calcium¬
free sea water, having a trace of calcium, showed the diatoms
to be sensitive even to slight variations of calcium. The time
required for cessation of motion, in general, was longer and
the time required for recovery was shorter.
Effects of calcium substitutions using barium and stron¬
tium are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. These ions substituted for
calcium for a finite period of time, and their substitution
time was not equivalent. Large differences between the
species Bacillaria Paradoxa, Pleurosigma Elongatum, and
Nitzschia Longissima were again recorded, and these differ¬
ences correlated with the differences found in calcium-free
sea water.
Other ionic changes were examined. The absence of sodium
with N-methyl glutamine substituted and, in a separate test,
lithium chloride substituted (Figs. 7 and 8). Potassium-free
sea water was also tested (Fig. 9). For both substitutions of
sodium-free sea water, large differences were recorded between
the species. Nitzschia Longissima was sensitive to N-methyl
glutamine substituted sea water, but insensitive to the lithium
