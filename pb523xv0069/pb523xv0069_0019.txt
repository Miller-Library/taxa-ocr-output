structures without breaking them. Two theories of exactly how
the wing-like extensions are used in coupling have been intro¬

Bacillaria do seem to have two raphes, one of which secretes
or pushes along on the neighboring diatom. The wing extensions
also show a lip on the end which would allow for their behav¬
ior as they slide past each other and become fully outstretched,
Further study is definitely indicated here to show the exact
positioning of the wing extensions in the coupling of the
colony.

help on the S.E.M. and fixation method. William Gilly, Chuck
Baxter, and Mark Denny also deserve thanks for their advice
throughout the quarter.
