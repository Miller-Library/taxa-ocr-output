basis for this theoy should be that production and excretion
of a mucopolysaccharide through the raphe is probably involved,
but, because no trails were observed, to varying degrees
for certain species. In Navicula Vulpina and Nitzschia
Closterium it appears only the posterior terminal pore and
maybe the posterior central pore are used during locomotion.
The remainder of the locomotory activity in Bacillaria and
other species observed particle streaming must reside in some
contractile mechanism, possibly actin fibers. Theories such
as a rotating tractor tread with reusable mucous (maybe leaving
a portion of the mucous down for a trail) or secretion along¬
side the retractable filaments are still possible depending
on the species in question. Certain types of Navicula, for
example, have readily been observed secreting large webs of
mucous which is used only as a substrate in which to live. On
the other hand, Bacillaria Paradoxa, which lives in colonies,
has no trails. The secreted material definitely seems to
expand, though, or appears ribbon-like, in some micrographs.
In any case, a general theory for locomotion seems too broad
to incorporate such highly variable plants as diatoms.
In the study done on coupling in Bacillaria Paradoxa
definite wing-like silica extensions of the frustule have been
observed. I believe the reason these have never been seen
before is because of less mild fixation methods and few rela¬
tively S.E.M. studies done on them. The gentle fixation methods
used in this study seem to have uncoupled the delicate
