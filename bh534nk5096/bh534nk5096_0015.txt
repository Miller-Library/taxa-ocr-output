Plasmid used in probe preparation. To obtain antisense mRNA, primarily in the
3 Untranslated region (UTR), plasmid was cut with Xmal and transcribed with T7 RNA
polymerase. For sense mRNA, used in controls, plasmid was cut with BstXl and
transcribed with T3.
Figure 2 Adult optic lobe
Section was stained with cresyl violet which only stains cell bodies. Scale bal
equals 150 microns. Outer granule layer (arrowhead) is separated from the inner
granule layer by the unstained plexiform zone (asterisk) which lacks cell bodies and
contains only axons and dendrites. Medulla is the region containing the islands of cells
separated by neuropil.
Figure 3 Outer granule layers labeled with both antisense (a) and sense (b) mRNA
probes
Scale bars equal 50 microns. Plexiform zone is labeled with a P, and outer
granule layer periphery is labeled with an O. Signal density is much higher in tissue
labeled with antisense mRNA probe than tissue labeled with sense probe.
