application, mounted tissue was dehydrated in ethanol, allowed to dry, and vacuum
desiccated for 2 hours to prevent tissue loss during hybridization. Probe was heated to
65 °C for 10 minutes. Approximately 300 - 400 ul of heated probe was then applied to
slides. A slightly-oversized piece of parafilm was placed on the slide, being careful to
avoid trapping bubbles. Slides were stored overnight in small, loosely-covered plastic
containers which were subsequently placed in a larger tightly sealed humid container at
60 °C. Parafilm coverslips were soaked off and slides washed in 4X SSC (0.15 M.
Nacl, 0.015 M sodium citrate). This was followed by treatment with RNase A and
washed in sequentially diluted solutions of SSC. 1 mM DTT was included in all SSc
washes. Slides were dehydrated in ethanol (50% and 70% EtOH made with SSC and
DII) and dried in a hood. Slides were coated with NTB-2 emulsion (Kodak) and stored
in light-tight containers for 7 - 10 days at 4 °C before development (4 min in Kodak D¬
19). After fixation (Kodak Rapid Fixer), slides were washed for -1 hour in running tap
water. They were then washed in acetate buffer (0.54% sodium acetate, 0.96% acetic
acid) and stained in 0.5% cresyl violet in acetate buffer for 4 minutes before being
processed through 50%, 70%, 95%, 100% EtOH and xylene. Finally, slides were
mounted with Permount and xylene and dried in the hood.
Quantification of signal density
Black and white video images were taken of slides. An imaging program (NIH
lmage 1.60/ppc) was used to capture frames from Hi-8 video images. Number of grains
was counted in randomly selected areas. The number of grains per unit area was
