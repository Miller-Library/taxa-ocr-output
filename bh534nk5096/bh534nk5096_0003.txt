INTRODUCTION
Voltage gated potassium channels are a diverse group of membrane spanning
proteins with functions ranging from regulation of action potentials to cardiac pace¬
making (Connor and Stevens, 1971; Byrne, 1980; Rogawaski, 1985; Hille, 1991) to
hormone secretion (Dubois and Rouzaire-Dubois, 1993). Such diversity of function is a
result of structural flexibility and variety. Channels are composed of associated a and
B-subunits. Ky channels are tetrameric proteins, consisting of 4 a-subunits which must
be from the same subfamily (Covarrubias et al. 1991; Li et al. 1992; Sheng et al. 1993:
Wang et al. 1993; Deal et al. 1994). Some Ky families also associate with cytoplasmic
B-subunits thus increasing structural diversity (Pongs, 1995).
In the past, most research on Ky channels has focused on the a-subunit.
However, examination of the a-subunit alone may present an incomplete picture of true
channel function since both a and B-subunits are present in vivo. Kyßs are divided into
two classes by their effects on channel function when co-expressed with a-subunits.
Kyßs are cytoplasmic proteins which have been found to interact specifically with the
NAB domain of KV1 a-subunits, a region which directs the different a-subunits to form
heterotetramers (Yu et al. 1996). The interaction of a and ß in the Kvl family does not
seem to require the N-terminus of the B-subunit (Nakahira et al. 1996).
Although the in vivo function of B-subunits alone is unknown (Yu et al. 1996), the
B-family has been found to have significant effects when co-expressed with a¬
subunits. Five B-subunit CDNAs, arising from three related genes, have been isolated
from mammalian heart and brain (Rettig et al. 1994, Majumder et al. 1995; Morales et
