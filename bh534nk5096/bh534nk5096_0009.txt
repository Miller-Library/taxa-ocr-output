containing mostly small amacrine cells (Figure 4a). Labeling in the inner part of the
Inner granule layer, with bipolar cells, was significantly greater than in the outer region
of the inner granule layer, where small amacrine cells are located (Figure 4b). Signal
densities in cells of the medulla were greater than those found in the surrounding
neuropil. (Figure 4c)
The histogram in Figure 5 describes the quantification of signal densities in each
cell layer labeled with antisense probe compared to that labeled with sense probe.
Grain counts in layers containing secondary and tertiary visual cells and bipolar cells
were significantly greater than those seen in small amacrine cell layers. Also, grain
counts were significantly greater in cellular regions of the medulla compared to neuropil
regions, indicating lack of Sa√ü mRNA in axons, dendrites, and glia.
Differential expression of B during development
Cross-sections were taken through the horizontal plane of a 38 day old
hatchling. Basic structure of the optic lobe was similar to that of the adult. However.
the plexiform zone (asterisk; Figure 6) was much smaller and neuropil did not constitute
as much of the medulla in comparison to the adult. Rather, cell clumps filled most of
the medulla. Amacrine cell layers were proportionately smaller, taking up less than a
quarter of each of the granule layers.
Late (294) stage embryo (Segawa et al. 1988) heads were also sectioned.
Again, basic histology followed adult optic lobe. However, the plexiform zone was even
smaller and in some areas, the two granule layers did not appear to be separated
