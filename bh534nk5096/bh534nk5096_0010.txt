(Figure 7). Almost no neuropil was present and we were unable to differentiate
between the different cells of the granule layers.
Labeling in the peripheral outer granule layer seems to increase with
developmental stages (Figure 8). However, it was not possible to compare signals
quantitatively between developmental stages because they were carried out as
separate experiments.
DISCUSSION
We constructed our RNA probe from a partial sequence obtained from the CDNA
library of the stellate ganglion. Although an RNase protection assay showed that Saß
was expressed in the stellate ganglion, we were unable to locate significant amounts of
Saß in this tissue by in situ hybridization. Sgß may be present in low abundance in the
stellate ganglion.
Because we lacked the N-terminus which is the primary determinant of the type
of ß subunit, we compared our sequence with those in the literature in an attempt to
classity Saß. Aside from the N-terminal, differences between rat Kyß1 and rat Kyß2 are
primarily scattered point differences. (Figure 9) However, many of these point
differences are conserved when comparing rat and bovine 82. Our partial clone
matched the rat and bovine ß2 in 14 sites where rat and bovine 82 were identical but
different from rat ß1. The opposite case, where our Sgß matched rat 81 where rat and
bovine B2 were the same, only occurred at 5 sites. Thus, it appears to be likely that
Saß belongs to the 82 family.
