cryoprotected 2 x 40 minutes in PBS with 20% sucrose. All procedures were done on
ice (4 °C). Tissues were blotted dry and coated with Polyfreeze (Polyscience) before
being embedded in Polyfreeze in gelatin capsules over dry ice. 8 - 12 micron sections
were cut in a cryostat and dried onto silanated slides. Slides were then washed in PBS
followed by graded dehydration through ethanol (50%, 70%, 95%, 100%). One slide
per set was stained with multiple stain (toluidine blue and basic fuchsin) and air dried
for 2 hours before mounting with Permount and xylene. After drying in the hood, slides
were either used for in situ hybridization or stored with dessicant at -70 °c.
Probe design and construction
Antisense probe (- 200 bp) was synthesized from a partial beta CDNA clone in
Bluescript KS+ phagemid (pBeta 3'-)after being linearized with Xmal. (Figure 1)
Transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was done using a Riboprobe kit (Promega) in a
5 ml reaction volume with 2S labeled UTP (20 uCilml). Sense probe (- 180 bp) was
transcribed from the same plasmid with T3 RNA polymerase after linearizing with BstxI.
Labeled probes were purified in Nu-Clean spin columns (IBI) and used in hybridization
buffer (62.5% deionized formamide, 12.5% dextran sulfate, 375 mM Nacl, 1.25X
Denhardts, 12.5 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1.25 mM EDTA) at a final concentration of about 5 x
106 cpm/ml.
Hybridization procedure:
The hybridization procedure used was described by Liu and Gilly (1995) and
adapted from Simmons et al (1989). Slides were incubated in proteinase K, rinsed in
triethanolamine, soaked in acetic anhydride, and washed in 2X SSC. Before probe
