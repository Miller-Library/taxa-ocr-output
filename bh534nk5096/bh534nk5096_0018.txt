Appendix 1 Young's schematic
This schematic represents the optic lobe of an adult squid. The top most layer is
the outer granule layer, containing large and small amacrine cells, and secondary
visual cells. This is separated from the inner granule layer by the plexiform zone which
consists mostly of axons and dendrites. Bipolar cells and small amacrine cells are
found in the inner granule layer. The majority of the optic lobe consists of the medulla
which contains tertiary visual cells and other cell bodies.
