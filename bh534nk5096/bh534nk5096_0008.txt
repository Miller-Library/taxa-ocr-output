calculated by the imaging program. P-values less than 0.01 from t-tests comparing
signal densities were considered significant.
RESULTS
Optic Lobe Structure in Adult Squid
General histology corresponds to that reported by Young (1974) (Appendix 1).
The outer granule layer (arrowhead; Figure 2) is about 70 microns thick and contains
several different types of cells. Secondary visual cells and large amacrine cells are
concentrated in the outer half of the outer granule layer and small amacrine cells are
localized to the inner half. The two granule layers are separated by the plexiform zone
(asterisk; Figure 2) which contains mostly axon bundles, dendrites, and glia. The inner
granule layer has small amacrine cells in the outer half and bipolar cells in the inner
region. The majority of the optic lobe consists of the medulla which contains an
interwoven network of cells, including tertiary visual cells, separated by areas of
neuropil.
In situ hybridization in adult optic lobe
In situ hybridization of sections with Saß antisense probe showed high leyels of
signal density in the peripheral region of the outer granule layer (Figure 3a). Labeling
with the sense probe did not show labeling above background levels (Figure 3b).
Hybridization of sections with Sgß antisense probe showed various signal
densities in different cell layers within the same tissue sample. Labeling in the
peripheral outer granule layer where secondary visual cells and large amacrine cells
predominate was significantly greater than in the interior of the outer granule layer.
