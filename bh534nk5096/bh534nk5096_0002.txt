ABSTRACT
Kyß subunits associate with a subunits and cause changes in both properties
(Kyß1) and expression level (Kyß2) of Ky potassium channels. Kyß1 has been noted to
Increase channel inactivation rates when co-expressed with Kva. Increases in
glycosylation efficiency and surface protein expression of a subunits have been
observed in the presence of Kyß2. A partial KVB CDNA clone (Sgß) was isolated from a
squid stellate ganglion CDNA library and tentatively identified as a 82-type. In situ
hybridization was used to examine Sgß mRNA distribution in adult, hatchling, and
embryonic squid. In optic lobes, RNA probe specific for Sgß preferentially labeled
cellular layers containing somata of secondary and tertiary visual neurons, bipolar
cells, and large amacrine cells. Based on grain density observations, Sgß was present
in nearly all medullar cells of post-embryonic squid. In stage 29+ embryos, Sgß grain
density was noticeably lower than in adults and hatchlings. Kyß subunits may be
expressed in different cells at various levels during development, adding another level
of regulation and possibly playing an important role in increasing Ky channel diversity.
