Figure 6 Hatchling granule layers
Plexiform zone is labeled with an asterisk and medulla is labeled with an arrow.
Scale bar equals 30 microns. Section was stained with cresyl violet and labeled with
antisense Saß RNA probe. Inner and outer layers are separated by the plexiform zone
Figure 7 Stage 29+ embryo granule layers
Scale bar equals 30 microns. Outer granule layer is surrounded by a layer of
tissue around the optic lobe and is labeled with an asterisk. Labeling appears to be
localized to the peripheral outer granule layer. Inner granule layer (arrow) is beneath
the plexiform zone.
Figure 8 Comparison of (a) adult, (b) hatchling, (c) embryo outer granule layers
Scale bars equal 30 microns. Region just outside the outer granule layer is
labeled with an O, and P denotes the plexiform zone. Labeling density appears to
Increase in the periphery of the outer granule layer through development.
Figure 9 Beta Sequence
Alignment of Saß with rat ß1 and 82 and bovine B2 provide evidence that Saß
belong to the B2 family. Dashes represent the same residue as in the first line (rat
