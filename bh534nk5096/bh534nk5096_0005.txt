Secondary and tertiary visual cells are present in the optic lobe, along with numerous
other types of interneurons.
Although the partial Sgß CDNA clone is missing the 5' end required for
unambiguous class identification, alignment with known ß sequences has led us to
believe that Saß may be a member of the B2 family. Using in situ hybridization, we
were able to locate Saß mRNA in various layers of the adult squid optic lobe. We also
searched for ß in the different stages of development to obtain a qualitative idea of
distribution patterns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue preparation
Live adult squid (Loligo opalescens) were collected in Monterey Bay, California.
and were held in tanks with circulating sea water at ambient temperatures (13 - 15 °c).
Embryos were from egg capsules laid by the captured squid. Egg capsules, once
collected, were kept until hatching in 20 gallon circular tanks with constant flow-through
seawater at ambient temperatures. Hatchlings (38 days old) used in this experiment
were kept in flow-through tanks and raised on a mixed diet (fed both Artemia and
copepods)
Tissues used for these experiments were dissected and fixed for approximately
one hour in an ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (130 mM Nacl, 7 mM
NazHPOz, 3 mM NaHzPO4, pH 7.0) directly after decapitation. Only the heads of the
embryos were used. Hatchlings had their mantles cut open to facilitate perfusion of
Polyfreeze. Tissue was then washed for 3 x 5 minutes in PBS before being
