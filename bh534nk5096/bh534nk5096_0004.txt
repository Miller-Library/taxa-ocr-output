al. 1995, England et al. 1995a; McCormack et al. 1995; Heinemann et al. 1995:
England et al. 1995b). Kyß1 and Kyß3 are known to increase inactivation rates of Kyl
channels by using a globular domain at the amino terminus similar to the inactivation
"ball" found in certain a-subunits (Hoshi et al. 1990; Rettig et al. 1994). Recent
experiments with ß3 suggest that B-subunits may act selectively, only associating with
some a subunits (Majumder et al. 1995; Morales et al. 1995). Kyß2 subunits, the most
abundant of the B-subunit isoforms in the mammalian brain (Rhodes et al. 1995:
Rhodes et al. 1996), appear to lack the amino terminus which functions as the
mactivation "ball" of B1 and ß3. Instead, 82, which shares -90% sequence homology
with B1 and 83 (Rettig et al. 1994), has been found to play a crucial role during K
channel biosynthesis by promoting cotranslational N-linked glycosylation of the initial
KV1.2 polypeptide, increasing stability of a-B complexes, and augmenting efficiency of
a-subunit expression (Shi et al. 1996). This effect is, in part, believed to involve 82
assisting in the proper folding of a-subunit polypeptides mediated through the
cotranslational interaction of ß2 with the a-subunit N-terminal cytoplasmic domain.
A partial B CDNA clone (Saß) has been isolated from a squid stellate ganglion
CDNA library and includes 3' coding and untranslated regions. In this study, we used in
situ hybridization techniques to search for Sgß mRNA in the optic lobe of adult.
hatchling, and embryonic squid. The optic lobe, a football-shaped structure adjacent to
each eye, is the primary region processing visual information from the eye. Divided
into three main regions, the two optic lobes are located on either side of the brain.
