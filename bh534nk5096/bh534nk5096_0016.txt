Peripheral region is at top of picture. Higher concentrations of signals are
present at the periphery, where secondary visual cells are located, compared to the
Inner region where small amacrine cells are present.
(b) Inner granule layer of adult
Unstained portion at top is plexiform region. Periphery of this layer of cells
contains small amacrine cells and signal density is low. High grain density is present in
the lower portion of the layer where bipolar cells are located.
(c) Adult Medulla
Regions surrounding the islands of cells are the neuropil, containing axons.
dendrites, and glia. Higher levels of mRNA appear to be present in cell bodies than the
neuropil.

layers and medulla
Saß signal density was found to vary in different adult squid optic lobe cell
layers. Sense levels were consistently low in all cell layers. Density levels were low in
layers containing small amacrine cells (inner outer granule layer and outer inner
granule layer), but high in layers with visual and bipolar cells. (Antisense: Outer outer
