Our in situ hybridization results seem to indicate that in adult squid optic lobe.
different amounts of Saß mRNA are found in different cells. Sgß mRNA appears to be
found in larger amounts in the regions where secondary visual cells and bipolar cells
are located. In contrast, low levels of Sgß mRNA are present in the regions
surrounding the plexiform zone which contains mostly small amacrine cells, High
signal density was found in some of the cells in the medulla, these possibly being the
tertiary visual cells. Saß mRNA did not seem to be present in the neuropil and
plexiform layers which lack cell bodies
The neurons in the optic lobe process visual information from the eye. The
primary visual cells in the eye synapse onto the secondary visual cells in the optic lobe
where high density signals were seen. Bipolar cells act as interneurons which transmit
information from the secondary visual cells to the tertiary visual cells, the primary
output neurons from the optic lobe to the brain. In each of these cell types a high
density of labeling was found, relative to the control sections, neuropil, and plexiform
zones.
Based upon our results, Saß appears to play an important and specific function
in squid optic lobe cells. Although we cannot determine the role that Sgß plays until we
obtain the full sequence and co-express it with a subunits, the presence of B subunits
indicated the potential for regulation of potassium channels in certain optic lobe cells.
