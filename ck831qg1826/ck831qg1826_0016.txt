limpets, however, lived communally and in close proximity on the rock faces,
Resource abundance and space limitations may play a role in determining the
behavior of the limpets, as might possible chemoreceptive mechanisms or a
sense of temporal territoriality. Since the study did not include such
measurements, this is not conclusive. As indicated, the traditional view of the
aggressive Lottia and its territory is not entirely correct; the territorial behavior in
the limpets may be more complicated than previously deemed.
