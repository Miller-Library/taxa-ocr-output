ment recorded for every limpet was then converted into a distance from that
limpet's home scar by measuring the minimum distance between the point and
home scar.
Tidal heights at the times of observation were calculated using Bryan
Wade's Tide Calculator tide prediction Fortran code program. For each time
point, the tidal heights were interpolated using the heights at the hours before
and after the session. Weather conditions, recorded once per day unless
drastic changes occurred, included sky (sunny, cloudy, foggy), and air (windy or
calm, temperature) conditions.
The data were then compiled in two manners: per limpet and per time
point. For each limpet size, home scar height, territory area, number of times
when displaced from home scar, fraction of observations when displaced from
home scar, and average distance of displacement were listed. At every time
point time, tide height, weather condition, number of limpets displaced from
home scar, fraction of limpets displaced from home scar, and average distance
of displacement were listed.
Next, the data taken per limpet were divided into two separate groups,
territorial and nonterritorial limpets, that were used for comparisons. The
limpets were classified as one or the other depending on two criteria: (1)
whether they exhibited aggressive territorial behavior, and (2) whether their
territories showed overlapping areas. Aggressive limpets with non-overlapping
ranges were deemed territorial.
