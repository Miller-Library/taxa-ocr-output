mme and standard deviation = 409.8 mm2. The distribution of shell sizes is
shown in figure 3. Territory size showed mean = 255 cm2 and standard
deviation = 230.7 cm2 (range = 14 to 1026 cm2). Home scar height above
MLLW ranged from 24 to 152 cm. Mean height was 78 cm with standard
deviation = 57.6 cm. The limpets were found displaced on the average 35% of
the time, and mean displacement = 13.9 cm.
Regressions indicated that larger limpets had larger territories, and were
found lower on the rock faces. Territory size plotted against shell size (fig. 4),
with both axes log transformed, resulted in a significant positive correlation (R =
0.489, P « 0.001, n = 51). Home scar height regressed against shell size (fig. 5)
also showed a significant relationship (R = 0.373, p « 0.01, n = 51). The log
transformation of both axes in the first regression analysis was performed in
order to minimize the increase in variance in the dependent variable (territory
size) as the independent variable (limpet size) increased.
The average displacement observed at a given time regressed against
the fraction of limpets that moved at that time (fig. 6) indicated a significant
positive slope (R = 0.580, p « 0.001, n = 98). In other words, as more limpets
moved, they traveled farther distances.
The ratio of average displacement to territory size regressed against
fraction of times displaced (fig. 7) showed a significant relationship (R =
0.57274,p « 0.001, n = 51). This suggested that the more often a limpet moved,
less distance it traveled each time.
