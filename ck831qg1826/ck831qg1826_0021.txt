Fig. 14) The fraction of shared territory regressed against the measured territory
size of nonterritorial limpets.
R=0.213, pÂ» 0.20, n = 19
No significant correlation was found. The fraction of territory shared
between limpets did not depend on the observed measured size of the
territories.
Fig. 15) The adjusted territory size regressed against the measured territory
size.
R =0.994, p + 0.001, n = 19
There was a significant positive correlation between adjusted territory
and measured territory sizes. Regardless of the proportion of territory
that was shared, the adjusted territory size was directly proportional to
measured territory size.
