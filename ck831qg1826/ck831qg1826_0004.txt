circular markers painted fluorescent orange were epoxied onto the rock with Z-
Spar Splashzone Compound marine epoxy. These markers and the cor-
responding maps allowed accurate measurements of limpet location.
Length and width of shell were initially measured for 58 limpets in the
sites. Shell area was calculated by assuming shell shape to be an ellipse, and
using the formula:
A-nab.
a=0.5(length)
b=O.5(width)
Limpet shells were cleaned and tagged with 1x3 cm color-coded markers glued
onto the shells with marine epoxy. The markers were cloth strips painted with
fluorescent paint using four colors in various combinations. The cloth allowed
permanent adhesion of paint and prevented disintegration of the tags by
constant exposure to the waves. Bright colors ensured ease of visibility from a
distance in all light conditions. All edges of the tags had to be buried in the
epoxy to prevent waves from ripping them out. Several limpets were retagged
after waves dislodged the markers before the epoxy hardened. Thus, each
limpet was identified by a color code and recorded by an identification number
assigned to each tag.
Data Collection
Observations were taken from vantage points situated high enough
above the waves to minimize the exposure of the observer and far enough
away to minimize detection of the observer by the limpets. For sites 1 and 2,
this was a tall boulder located approximately 4-5 meters in front of the sites.
Sites 3 and 4 were observed through 10x binoculars from approximately 40
