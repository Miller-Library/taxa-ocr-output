This study investigates the communal behavior of Lottia gigantea near
Monterey. It attempts to determine whether limpets in the Monterey area are
territorial or are more tolerant of each other and show no distinct territories, and
to determine, if they show variation in behavior, what causes this variation.

Experimental Location and Design
The study was conducted at Point Cabrillo, Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, Ca. Two vertical granite rock faces were chosen as test locations
because of the abundant Lottia present, and their ease of access and
observation. Both WNW-orientated faces lie in the mid-to-high intertidal zone,
and are directly exposed to incoming waves. The first rock face contained two
test sites. The two are situated two meters apart, with the smaller Site 2 partially
shielded from waves by a large boulder. Sites 3 and 4 are located adjacent to
each other on the second rock face, divided by a crevice that prevents limpets
from traversing from site to site. This face is located within a shallow cove;
although it is exposed to incoming waves, the cove may reduce hydrodynamic
forces imposed on the face and its inhabitants.
The sites were photographed and measured. Maps of each site were
carefully drawn onto graph paper, using the photographs to mark site
boundaries and all physical features, including rock formations, algal patches,
and mussel beds. Depending on the site, map scales were either 15 or 30 cm
of actual substratum per inch of paper. At 30 cm intervals on the sites, 9 mm
