Next, the large number of limpets in close proximity on the rock faces
might prevent individuals from defending large territories. While Stimson did
not taken population density measurements, preventing any comparison with
this study, this might also contribute to the communal variation in their behavior.
Limpets may lear that defending large territories with others around consumes
a large proportion of energy and time that might not be readily available.
Tolerance of others could have been learned from experience, just as territorial
behavior might have been conditioned from previous experience (Wright and
Shanks, 93).
Regression analysis showed a correlation between limpet size and home
scar height for territorial limpets, but not for nonterritorial limpets. The tolerance
that nonterritorial limpets show of others and their ability to share grazing areas
allow nonterritorial limpets more freedom of movement to locate areas of better
food abundance. As a result, they may not be limited as to where they form a
home scar. On the other hand, existence of home scars indicates that they do
prefer a "home;" thus, they are not completely nomadic.
On territoriality...
The two criteria used to determine territoriality of the limpets appeared to
be sufficient. During the course of observations, the limpets were seen to graze
in distinct areas. For many of the limpets, the boundaries of these areas may be
underestimated. Insufficient data prevented a more accurate presentation of
these areas, especially those under 100 cm2. However, all limpets designated
