limpets to be significantly greater than the 199 cm2 mean for territorial limpets (p
= 0.002).
Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between
limpet size and height of home scar for territorial limpets (R = 0,519, p « 0.005)
(fig. 10), but no significant correlation between the two for nonterritorial limpets
(R = 0.110, p » 0.50) (fig. 11). Again, a test for equality of slopes found no
difference between the slopes of the two regressions(p = 0.480), and the
corresponding analysis of covariance found no significant differences in home
scar height between the two groups after removing limpets size as a source of
variation (p = O.194).
Lastly, regression analysis showed a significant inverse power
relationship between the average displacement-range size ratio and the
fraction of times displaced for territorial limpets (R = 0.595, p « 0.001) (fig. 12),
but no similar correlation (R = 0.356, p » 0.10) for nonterritorial limpets (fig. 13).
The slopes of the lines were not significantly different (p = 0.282), and the
following analysis of covariance found no significant difference (p = 0.184)
between the two groups.
Nonterritorial limpets
There was no significant correlation between the measured grazing area
size and the amount of area shared (R = 0.213, p» 0.20, n = 19) (fig. 14). Each
limpet was assigned an adjusted area, defined as a sum of the unshared parts
of its measured grazing area and a fraction of the area shared with other
limpets. The fraction equaled 1/2 if two limpets were sharing the area, 1/3 if
