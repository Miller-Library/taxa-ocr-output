"nonterritorial" were seen in areas shared by other limpets, and all the
"territorial" limpets did show recognition of boundary lines,
For example, limpet +22 and +23, whose home scars were only 20 cm
apart, carefully avoided the other’s territory so strictly that when one came to the
boundary, it would halt, pause, rotate around until it was positioned parallel to
the boundary, then continue grazing along the boundaries. Limpet #1 and 44,
ended a confrontation when each stopped pushing, rotated in opposite
directions, and continued grazing along the border of their adjacent territories in
opposite directions. These limpets were also only 7% different in size (1561.4
vs. 1664.2 mm2). Also, limpet 433, designated "nonterritorial," entered foreign
territory, only to be repelled and briefly chased by the slightly larger territorial
limpet, which left its own ground to chase #33 into the latter's territory. Äfter this
encounter, the unmarked territorial limpet retreated directly back into its territory,
stopping and turning only when it reached its own territory.
This indicates two things. First, all of the limpets seem to recognize
borders and, thus, territories, as seen by the regular grazing of each limpet in a
certain area. This implies a possible chemosensitive (olfactory), visual, or even
tactile behavioral response not yet identified. Since Lottia have been
commonly observed responding defensively to contact with Pisaster tube feet
(Bullock, 1953), it may be possible that they also detect the presence or grazing
areas of other limpets. Next, not all limpets respond to, although they may
detect, the presence of other limpets' territories. One obviously notes the
