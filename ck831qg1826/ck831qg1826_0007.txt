Fifty-one of 58 limpets were observed displaced from their home scars
more than twice. Two limpets did not move at all during the times observed,
and the remaining five moved once or twice for a distance less than their shell
length. These seven limpets could not be classified as territorial or
nonterritorial; they were, thus, discarded from all data analysis.
Thirty-two limpets appeared to graze in an area in which no other limpet
was found. The remaining 19 limpets were found to share 7-59% of their
grazing area with at least one other individual and are, therefore, nonterritorial.
Limpet numbers 2 and 3, 9 and 14, 7 and 15, 10 and 11, 34 and 41, 53 and 57
shared territory space, limpet 433, 437, and 438 shared, as did limpet numbers
26-29 (see figures 1 and 2).
During the course of the study, limpet 41 and 44, #36 and #49 showed
aggressive encounters in which they met, turned towards each other, pushed
and shoved briefly, then turned away from each other and continued grazing
along their respective territorial boundaries. Limpet #33 had an encounter with
a slightly larger, unmarked limpet that shoved 433 until 433 rotated and
escaped back up into its territory. The unmarked limpet promptly turned around
and returned to its own territory.
Limpet statistics
Initially, the limpets from all four sites were tested as one large sample (n
= 51). Limpet shell size varied from 1423.2 to 3165.1 mm2 with mean = 1638.8
