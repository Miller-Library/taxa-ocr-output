Figure Legend:
Fig. 1) The maps of sites 1 and 2, showing all locations observed of all limpets.
Each limpet is color coded, and the lines delineate boundaries of grazing
ranges. The areas within each range that show a high density of points
indicates home scars.
Fig. 2) The maps of sites 3 and 4, showing all locations observed of all limpets.
Each limpet is color coded, and the lines delineate boundaries of
grazing ranges. The areas within each range that show a high density of
points indicates home scars.
Fig. 3) Histogram distribution of limpet shell sizes.
mean = 1638.8 mm2, standard deviation = 409.8 mm2
range = 956.1 - 3165.8 mm2
n =51
Fig. 4) Territory size (log transformed) regressed against limpet size (log
transformed).
R =0.489, p « 0.001, n = 51
Territory size shows a significant positive correlation with limpet
size. Territory size increases as limpets get larger.
Fig. 5) Limpet size regressed against home scar height.
R = 0.373, p « 0.01, n =51
Limpet size is negatively correlated with height of home scar. Larger
limpets form home scars lower on the rock, closed to the water.
Fig. 6) Average displacement of limpets recorded at any given observation
session regressed against the percentage of the limpets that moved at
that session.
R = 0.580, p « 0.001, n = 98
There was a positive correlation between average displacement of
limpets and the fraction of limpets displaced at a given observation
session. Under favorable environmental conditions, when more limpets
move, they move greater distances.
Fig. 7) The ratio of average displacement to territory size regressed against the
fraction of times a limpet was found displaced.
R =0.573, p « 0.001, n = 51
Since the average displacement for a limpet depended on territory
size, the ratio of the two provided a normalized measure that could be
compared to the frequency of limpet displacements. A significant
negative relationship was found. A limpet that moved more frequently
covered less distance in its territory each time compared to a limpet that
moved infrequently, but traveled greater distances when it did move.
