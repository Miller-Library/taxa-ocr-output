meters on the opposite side of the cove when the tide was high, and by wading
out into the cove when the tide was low.
Observation sessions included recording limpet location onto the maps
and looking for any overt behavior (e.g., confrontation between limpets). Time
of day, sea and weather conditions were also noted for each session. A single
map was used to record several sessions, using colored pens to differentiate
between time points. The distribution of observation sessions was as follows:
site 1 was measured 43 times, site 2, 20 times, site 3 and 4, 18 times each.
Data Preparation
After collecting all the data, each location recorded for each limpet in a
given site was labeled on a set of "master" maps constructed on Adobe
Photoshop 3.0 using a Macintosh computer. Connecting the outer-most points
delineated grazing area boundaries for each limpet. Small areas showing
multiple points indicated home scars for each limpet. These locations of high
point density occurred because limpets were often recorded at their home
scars. Because the limpets were plotted with different colors, the master maps
clearly showed grazing territories of each individual.
The area of each grazing range was measured by transferring the
boundary lines onto grid paper, counting grid boxes, and multiplying by the
scaled area of each box. Once home scars were identified, the height of each
could be measured as a distance above mean lower water. Height
measurements were taken with a surveyor's transit and stadia rod, using USGS
Topographic Marker "Mussel Point +1" as the reference point. Each measureÂ¬
