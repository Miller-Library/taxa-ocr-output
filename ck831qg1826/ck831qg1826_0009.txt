No significant relationships were found between average distance or
fraction of times displaced as a function of tidal height or time.
Comparisons between territorial and non-territorial limpets
For territorial limpets, mean shell size was 1679.9 mm2, with a range from
956.1 to 3165.1 mm2, mean territory size = 199 cm2 (14 - 846 cm2), mean home
scar height = 73 cm (24 - 132 cm). Nonterritorial limpets averaged 1569.7 mm?
(1080.1 - 2048.9 mm2) in shell size, 351 cm2 (77-1023 cm2) in territory size, and
86 cm (47 - 152 cm) in home scar height. T-tests performed between the
territorial and nonterritorial means found no significant differences in either
limpet size or home scar height. However, the test indicated a significant
difference in territory sizes between territorial and nonterritorial limpets. The
nonterritorial limpets had larger grazing ranges.
Log transformed territory sizes were again regressed to limpet size, also
log transformed. Nonterritorial limpets (fig. 8) showed no correlation between
limpet size and grazing range size (R = 0.439, p » 0.05, n = 19), whereas
territorial limpets (fig. 9) showed a significant positive correlation between the
two sizes (R = 0.613, p « 0.001, n = 32). Since the former had a significantly
larger range size than the latter, the groups were retested for the significant
correlation after removing differences in shell size between the groups. A test
for equality of slopes indicated no significant difference between the slopes of
the two regression lines (p = 0.629); analysis of covariance could thus be
performed. Äfter removing shell size as a source of variance between the two
groups, the test still found the mean range size of 351 cm* for nonterritorial
