Abstract- The wave-exposed, rocky outcrops of the intertidal zone at Hopkins
Marine Station (Pacific Grove, CA) exhibit large numbers of Lottia gigantea
grazing and homing on what appears to be shared territories. This contradicts
previous studies in which Lottia were found to be solitary and territorial,
aggressively repelling intruders and forming distinct territories of bare rock.
This study observed 58 individually tagged limpets on four sites located on two
vertical rock faces. By taking multiple observations of limpet displacements,
recorded on predrawn maps of each site, limpet home scars and territory
boundaries were identified. Limpet size and home scar height above mean
lower water were also measured. Nineteen individuals were identified as nonÂ¬
territorial, 32 as territorial, and 7 as indistinguishable (no movement was
recorded). Non-territorial limpets grazed an area larger than those of their
territorial counterparts (mean = 351 cm2 vs. 199 cm2). The variation suggests
that Lottia territorial behavior may be more complex than previously thought.
