Introduction:
The Lottia gigantea is a large, 5-8 cm long limpet that inhabits the rocky
shorelines of Western North America. They are found on outcrops exposed to
the water, preferring vertical walls where wave action is heaviest. Lottia
gigantea are found from the tip of Point Reyes, CA, down to Cerros Island,
Mexico.
In 1970, John Stimson studied the territorial behavior of Lottia gigantea
on the coast of Santa Barbara County, CA. He described the territory of a limpet
as a distinct, round or oval patch of bare rock, bordered by algal growth and
sessile organisms such as mussels. The rock was slightly discolored with an
algal film, and within each area existed one solitary Lottia that grazed on the
film. The limpet showed homing behavior, as described by Fisher (1904), but
also exhibited a defensive territorial behavior in which a resident limpet would
aggressively shove other Lottia and individuals of other species off its territory.
Much work has been done on Lottia since Stimson's original
observations, and most of it has noted that these organisms are indeed
aggressively territorial (Stimson, 1973; Wright, 1982; Wright and Shanks, 1992).
However, Lottia observed on the coast of the Monterey Peninsula, CA, have
exhibited a drastically different behavior. Although many individuals are
observed to maintain territorial patches of rock as described by Stimson, others
were found living together in close proximity on large, bare rock walls without
territorial boundaries. This apparent lack of territories suggests possible
variation in limpet behavior.
