shared grazing areas of nonterritorial limpets, but also some individuals, like
f33, disregard the boundaries of even territorial limpets.
Interestingly, no limpet, territorial or otherwise, was observed intruding
into the area of another's home scar. Some limpets such as numbers 1, 26, 33
and 37 graze past other home scars, but never have they been seen grazing
over a scar. Distance between home scars has no relationship to territoriality of
neighbor limpets; some territorial limpets home at locations just 10 cm apart
while others are 40 cm apart, and nonterritorial limpets and combinations of
both show similar numbers in home scar distances.
Previous papers (Stimson 1970, 1973) describe limpet territories as
circular or oval areas. Although this may be true for solitary, territorial limpets,
this did not seem to be the case for communal limpets. Again, insufficient data
may be the culprit, but the tested individuals often showed long, narrow
territories that border on large rock formations or algal patches. Individuals
grazing on such territories include limpet numbers 15, 21, 29, 32, 33, and 53.
Rock formations are difficult to bulldoze, so limpets have to accommodate to
such obstructions One such formation seems to prevent limpet #32 and #33
from grazing on each other's area. On the other hand, limpets are known to
bulldoze algal clumps when forming and maintaining territories, but the limpets
in this study were observed grazing around patched of Endocladia in their
territories.
Some limpets homed at one location, but then traverse great distances to
graze. Limpet 410, 411, 418, show this pattern.
