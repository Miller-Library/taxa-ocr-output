three were sharing, etc. The mean of these adjusted area sizes = 307 cm2. The
adjusted area sizes were then plotted against the measured area sizes (fig. 15).
and a highly significant positive relationship was found (R = 0.994, p « 0.001, n
= 19).
A final t-test comparing the means of the adjusted areas of nonterritorial
limpets and the areas of territorial limpets showed no significant difference in
territory size. In other words, all the limpets grazed areas that were
approximately the same size, but those that shared grazing areas with others
required more total range area than the limpets that grazed isolated ranges.

About Limpet Statistics...
Mean grazing range sizes for both territorial or nonterritorial limpets (199
and 351 cm“ respectively) were found to be much smaller than grazing range
sizes measured by other researchers. Stimson calculated territory sizes
averaging 900 cm2 per limpet (Stimson, 1970).
Various factors may contribute to this large discrepancy. First, Lottia
grazing range size changes with algal abundance, shrinking when algae are
abundant and enlarging when scarce (Stimson, 1973). Although no data were
taken on algal abundance in this study, variation in algal density between
Santa Barbara County, where Stimson took his measurements, and here in
Monterey might contribute to the size differences.
