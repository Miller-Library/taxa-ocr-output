â€ž.And the nonterritorial limpets
The amount of shared grazing area may depend on limpet density, local
resource abundance, and location. At site 2, four of five limpets shared
substantial proportions of their territories (30%-59%). These limpets also
homed at close proximity to each other; limpet +27 and +28 homed the closest
at 6 cm apart, limpet +25 was 15 cm from +27, and +29 was 30 cm from +28 (fig.
Apart from site 2, in which close proximity of individuals and large
overlap among ranges showed otherwise, no two limpets were seen in shared
areas simultaneously. When one limpet was within the shared area, the other
was observed grazing elsewhere. This may be due to pure coincidence, distinct
grazing patterns that placed limpets apart at a given time, or a sense of
temporal territoriality. Although verification of this speculation will require a
completely new study, perhaps the limpets can sense the presence of others
such that they will actively avoid the other when grazing in a shared area. This
again suggests possible chemoreceptive behaviors in Lottia.
Conclusion:
The results of this study indicated that variation does exist in the territorial
behavior of Lottia gigantea. Nineteen of 51 limpets were designated as
nonterritorial limpets because they grazed on shared territories, and exhibited
no aggressive behavior towards others. The other 32 limpets were considered
territorial since they appeared to maintain and defend territorial spaces. All
