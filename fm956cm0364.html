INTRODUCTION
On California rocky shores <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyanoplax hartwegii : Exact'>Cyanoplax hartwegii</span> (Carpenter,
1855) occurs in higher tidepools, damp crevices, and under
dense stands of algae at intertidal heights of +1.5 to +4.0
ft above mean lower low water (Andrus and Legard, 1974).
In the Monterey Bay region the densest populations (up to
30/m*) are found on rocks covered by heavy beds of the
brown alga, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia fastigiata : Exact'>Pelvetia fastigiata</span> (J.G. Agardh) DeToni, at
a tidal height of about +3 to +3.5 ft, in areas protected
from strong wave action. Few erect plants grow under the
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia : Exact'>Pelvetia</span> cover, but a film of encrusting red algae and
microscopic species are generally present.
According to Robb (1974), in this habitat Pelvetia is a
major food of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. hartwegii.</span> In addition, Pelvetia might be
expected to offer protection to the chitons against wave
surge and desiccation, and to provide an excellent screen
against predators. Preliminary field observations carried
out at low and intermediate tides both day and night revealed
no instances of predation on C. hartwegii but disclosed a
number of species deemed potential predators including the
carnivorous snails <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Thais emarginata : Exact'>Thais emarginata</span> (Deshayes, 1839) and

<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Larus occidentalis : Exact'>Larus occidentalis</span> (Audubon, 1839). The present investigation
posed the questions: 1) do some or all of these organisms
prey on C. hartwegii, and 2) does the Pelvetia bed habitat
provide significant protection for the chitons against some
or all of these predators? To answer these questions, predation
on naturally occurring populations and on populations
situated where extant Pelvetia was removed, was studied in
the field. Concurrent with these field observations, artificial
test situations were set up in laboratory aquaria to induce
interaction between potential predators and Cyapoplax. I
herein report on these studies, conducted in the spring of
1974.
FIELD STUDIES: METHODS AND RESULTS
A Pelvetia fastigiata covered granite rock with a surface
area of about
1.5 meterse was chosen as a site to study
the role of Pelvetia as a deterrant to predation on Cyanoplax.
The rock was surrounded by sand at a tidal height of about t3
ft and was located off of a protected point of the Hopkins
Marine Station property in Pacific Grove, California. To
the natural population of 25 Cyanoplax was added 30 additional
Cyanoplax. After the population stabilized for five days to
45 chitons, all the Pelvetia from one side of the rock was
page 4

removed, exposing half of the Cyanoplax population. A
common predator of intertidal molluscs, Pisaster ochraceus,
was used as the test predator. Four <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pisaster : Exact'>Pisaster</span> were added to
each side of the test rock 30 minutes before the oncoming
tide washed over the rock. During the next tidal cycle, any
Pisaster that left the rock was replaced; this happened on
eight occasions on the side where Pelvetia remained and only
twice on the bare side. During the tidal cycle, ten chitons
from the bare side and only two from the <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pelvetia : PartialExact'>Pelvetia side</span> were
eaten (a significant difference; p(.05, Chi-squared test).
This finding supports the concept that Pelvetia offers
Cyanoplax protection.
Although numerous <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula : Exact'>Tegula</span> sp. and various <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea : Exact'>Acmaea</span> spp. were
present, none were eaten, even though it has been demonstrated
by Landenberger (1968), Mausey (1966), and Paine (1969)
that both species are eaten by Pisaster at a higher rate than
chitons.
odetermine the effect of Larus occidentalis, the
western gull, on the Cyanoplax population, a survey of Granite
Point within Pt. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lobos : Exact'>Lobos</span> State Reserve, Monterey County, California
was made in conjunction with Moore's study (1974). The
study site and the procedures are described by Moore (1974).
Cyanoplax was conspicuous only within an area approximately
20 mx 3 m which had scattered dense layers of Pelvetia; its
density there was estimated to be 4 Cyanoplax/m2. No Cyanoplax
shell plates were found in over 100 regurgfitation pellets of
DeBevoise

the gulls, while Moore found plates of 62 individuals of the
more exposed and abundant chiton, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nuttallina : Exact'>Nuttallina</span> californiga
(Reeve, 1847). Thus there is no indication that this common
foraging bird feeds on the locally available Cyanoplax.
LABORATORY STUDIES: METHODS AND RESULTS
In order to test for predation under controlable conditions.
Cyanoplax and potential predators were kept in aquaria both
in the presence and in the absence of algal covering. One
set of experiments was conducted in indoor aquaria measuring
60 x 30 x 30 cm, and provided with a constant flow of
unfiltered seawater at 14°C. The natural day-night cycle was
maintained, occasionally being interrupted at night with
artificial lights. Two rocks, one bare, one covered with
Pelvetia fastigiata, each with a surface area of about 300
cm", were placed at opposite ends of each aquarium, on a 2 cm
layer of coarse sand and shell fragments. On each rock three
Cyanoplax were placed: 1 small (1-2 cm), 1 medium (2-3 cm).
and I large (3-4 cm). Potential predators, in various
densities, were added to the middle of the aquaria.
Observations were made at 12 hour intervals, and dead or
missing chitons were replaced immediately. Chitons found on
the bottom of the rock, or on the side of the tank were
placed back on top of their assigned rock.
Further tests were made in two 1.5 m2 screened-off
sections of outdoor cement tanks containing running seawater
at a depth of 0.5 m, and at 1541°C. In each section a Pelvetia
DeBevoise
Predation on Cyanoplax
page 6
covered rock and a bare rock, each about 30 cm in diameter,
was suspended about 2 cm from the bottom but totally submerged.
This was done to insure that chitons placed on the rocks
would remain there; starfish then placed in the tank could
reach and climb up on the rocks without apparent difficulty.
Six chitons (2 large, 2 medium, and 2 small) were placed on
each rock. Eight Pisaster ochraceus were then added to each
section and the number of Cyanoplax consumed was monitored daily
for one week. Patiria miniata was also studied with identical
conditions and methods.
A list of species tested and a quantitative summary of
the results can be found on Table 1.
Of all animals tested, <span style='background-color:grey' title='Pisaster ochraceus : Fuzzy'>Pisater ochraceus</span> was the most
voracious in the small aquaria' they ate an average of .75
chiton/day. There was a preference for chitons over 2 cm.
and for those on bare rocks (both results significant at P(.05
chi-square test). No chitons were taken from a rock covered
by Pelvetia. In the large tanks, within one week 12 (7 large.
5 medium and O small) from the bare rock and one medium
chiton from the rock covered by Pelvetia fastigiata, were
taken.
Over a 12 day period using one large <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hemigrapsus nudus : Exact'>Hemigrapsus nudus,</span>
three chitons were eaten.
During a two week test, three <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pachygrapsus crassipes : PartialExact'>Pachygrapsus crassipes
ate</span> three chitons. Both <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hemigrapsus : Exact'>Hemigrapsus</span> and <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pachygrapsus : PartialExact'>Pachygrapsus may</span>
have eaten chitons which had moved from their rock to the

side of the tank.
Leptasterias pusilla were observed to eat three Cyanoplax
1 om in length over a four week period.
Within the small aquaria Patiria miniata were observed
to partially eat three Cyanoplax, but in the larger outdoor
tanks no predation occurred, which suggests that <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Patiria : Exact'>Patiria</span> is
not a significant predator under natural conditions.
The two carnivorous snails Thais emarginata and Acanthina
spirata, and the hermit crabs <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus : Exact'>Pagurus</span> spp. were all tested as
potential predators for four weeks and no predation was
observed.
DISCUSSION
This study indicates that Pisaster ochraceus is an
important predator on Cyanoplax hartwegii under artificial
conditions. Yet, in the intertidal zone densities of 30
Cyanoplax/m2 can be observed. These high densities are
found at a tidal height of +3 to +4 ft, thus they are
typically covered by water for only seven hours a day, and
consequently are potential prey for Pisaster only a fraction
of the day, since this predator feeds mostly underwater.
However the present investigation indicates that the presence
of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pelvetia : PartialExact'>Pelvetia may</span> be a more important deterrant to predation than
the short exposure period. Perhaps Pisaster avoids Pelvetia
because the algal mass blocks firm attachment or perhaps the
DeBevoise

movement of the fronds with the waves is itself a deterrant.
Despite the predation found in the laboratory by
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pachygrapsus crassipes : Exact'>Pachygrapsus crassipes</span> and Hemigrapsus nudus, they are
probably not major predators on Cyanoplax hartwegii.
This
is supported by Hiatt (1948) who ranked the feeding preferences
of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pachygrapsus : Exact'>Pachygrapsus</span> in order of decreasing importnaces as:
1) live algae, 2) detritus, and 3) littoral animals, on
which it is chiefly a scavenger and less often a predator.
Hiatt also reports that Hemigrapsus subsists primarily on
detritus and infrequently on algal fronds.
Predation by Leptasterias pusilla, Pachygrapsus crassipes
and Hemigrapsus nudus was low in the indoor aquaria.
However, if this rate is characteristic of natural predation,
the effect on the population of the slow growing chitons
may be important.
Cyanoplax hartwegii is well adapted to the <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pelvetia fastigiata : PartialExact'>Pelvetia
fastigiata community.</span> Pelvetia offers an abundant food
source, protection from wave surge and desiccation and from
Pisaster ochraceus.
SUMMARY
According to both the experiments and field observations,
potential predators on Cyanoplax hartwegii are ranked as
follows:

Pachygrapsus crassipes (occasional)
Hemigrapsus nudus (occasional)
The algal covering of Pelvetia fastigiata is a protective
barrier from predation against Pisaster ochraceus, and
possibly from birds; all the other potential predators
tested showed no preference for chitons on bare rocks as o
opposed to those covered by Pelvetia.
