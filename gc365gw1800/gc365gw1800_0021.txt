Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia
Wavelength scan of methanol extract of "sinker" eggs from a single ascidian.
Absorbence spectrum of methanol extraction from the less buoyant eggs from
individual 2.5. The broad peak from about 290 to 380 nm contains the bulk of
the mycosporine-like amino acids in the extract.
