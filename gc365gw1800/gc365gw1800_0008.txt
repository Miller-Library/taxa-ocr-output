Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia
Spectrophotometry
Only the first methanol extract was scanned in the spectrophotometer. A wavelength
scan was performed on each sample using a background standard of 90% methanol.
Absorbence between -0.05 and 0.3 absorbence units was measured for the first trial; while
for the second, absorbence was measured between -0.05 and 0.5 units to account for the
increased absorbence due to pooling of the two collections of floaters. The scan was
performed between 200 and 600 nm. Samples were diluted 2-, 3-, or 5-fold with 100%
methanol if they exceeded this absorbence range. Integration of the area enclosed beneath
the absorbence curve between 300 and 400 nm was calculated by the spectrophotometer
computer program. This integration value was multiplied by a dilution factor if the sample
had been diluted and standardized to the amount of protein present in the original sample as
determined by a protein assay (see below).
Protein Assay
A BCA assay for protein content was performed on each of the methanol-extracted egg
samples as described by Brown et al (1989), with several modifications. The samples left
overnight in IN NaÖH were heated to 60°C in a water bath and vortexed extensively to
dissolve the pellet. 10 mL and 20 mL aliquots of each of the floater protein samples, and 5
mL and 10 mL aliquots of each sinker sample were combined with enough IN NaÖH to
bring the volume to 20 mL. 980 mL deionized water were then added to each sample.
BSA standards were prepared using 20 mL IN NaÖH and 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mL of a 10
mg/mL solution of BSA in water. Deionized water was added to achieve a final volume of
1 mL for each standard.
10 mL of each sample or standard were combined in Eppendorf tubes with 990 mL
deionized water and 0.1 mL 0.15% DOC. Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at room
temperature and then 0.1 mL 72% TCA was added to each sample or standard. The tubes
were vortexed and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The resulting
