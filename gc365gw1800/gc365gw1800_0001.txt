Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia
ABSTRACT
Background: A photoprotective role has been ascribed to the ultraviolet radiation-absorbing
mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) present in the follicle cells surrounding eggs of the
tunicate Ascidia ceratodes.
Approach: Studies were performed using natural sunlight and a variety of wavelength filters to
expose intact Ascidia eggs and eggs in which the MAA-containing follicle cells had been
removed to various types of ultraviolet radiation. The kinetics of development were examined
to ascertain whether the follicle cells were acting to protect the eggs from UV damage.
Results: This series of studies demonstrated that at ambient solar radiation levels there are no
observable differences in rates of early development between Ascidia embryos where follicle
cells were removed and embryos with an intact follicle cell layer.
Conclusions: This study suggests that the tunicate embryo has a variety of defenses against UV
damage, and the defensive role played by mycosporine-like amino acids may not be of primary
importance.
INTRODUCTION
The bulk of the ultraviolet radiation that penetrates the Earth's atmosphere is
traditionally classified into UVA, with wavelengths between 400 and 320 nanometers, and
UVB, with wavelengths between 320 and 280 nm (Chrispeels 1996). The biological relevance
of such radiation to marine organisms was first recognized in the middle of this century (Koller
168). At this time, it was also discovered that UV radiation can penetrate into seawater to
depths of 20 meters or more (Jerlov 1950).
It is in this UV-exposed water column that eggs of the solitary ascidian Ascidia
ceratodes are fertilized and undergo their early development. Ascidian eggs do not
immediately sink out of the range of UV-irradiation; they are buoyed by their surrounding layer
of follicle cells (Lambert and Lambert, 1978). These follicle cells are also thought to be
