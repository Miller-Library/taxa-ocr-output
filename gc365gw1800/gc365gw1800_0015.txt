Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia
A preliminary study of mycosporine content of more buoyant eggs versus that of less buoyant
eggs indicated that the eggs with higher buoyancy had higher concentrations of mycosporines,
which seemed reasonable given that such buoyant eggs would spend a significantly longer
portion of their time of development at the top of the water column, where UV radiation levels
are highest. A second trial in which more individuals were assayed indicated that this trend
was not consistent, and concentration of mycosporines in eggs of varying buoyancies varied
unpredictably from individual to individual. This indicates that the data discussed above are
not artifacts of the method of egg preparation used in the described experiments.
CONCLUSIONS
Under midday springtime sunshine, the mycosporines in follicle cells are not the solo
line of defense in Ascidia embryos. The eggs do not exhibit observable delays during early
cleavage when irradiated with natural sunlight and allowed the opportunity to photorepair,
regardless of whether mycosporine-containing follicle cells are removed or are allowed to
remain surrounding the egg. It is more difficult to draw the same conclusions with regard to
tadpole hatching kinetics, which indicates that further experiments on the matter are in order.
These observations complement conclusions drawn by previous researchers, who observed a
developmental delay in both Ascidia ceratodes and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis when
eggs were irradiated with UV lamps and photorepair was prevented (Hemela 1993; Adams and
Shick 1996). The results of this study, however, are more indicative of what is likely to happen
to embryos developing in a natural setting.
