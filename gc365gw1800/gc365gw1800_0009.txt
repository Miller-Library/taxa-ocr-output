Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia
supernatant was aspirated and each pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of a 5% SDS, O.1 N
NaOH solution.
200 mL of working reagent were added to an appropriate number of wells of a flat-
bottomed 96-well plate and 10 mL of each sample or standard were added to triplicate
wells and mixed with pipet tips. The plate was then incubated at 60°C for between 90
minutes and 2 hours, until a good linear trend developed for the standards when read at 550
nm by a microplate reader.
Data Analysis
The integration value for each sample was multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor and
the resulting quantity was divided by mg protein present in the original sample as
determined by the BCA protein assay.

RESULTS
Cleavage Delay
Two experimental trials measured the effect of exposure to various wavelengths of UV
on early cleavage times. Intact and defolliculated eggs were fertilized, immediately placed in
petri dishes and exposed to solar UVA or UVA and UVB. Controls were placed under a filter
that did not transmit any ultraviolet radiation. The embryos were allowed to develop until a
test dish indicated that embryos were beginning to undergo cleavage to the 8-cell stage, at
which time all embryos were fixed in formaldehyde. Samples were then scored to determine
the distribution of embryos that had developed to the 1-,2-, 4- and 8-cell stage. Embryos at the
1-cell stage were not included in the data analysis as unfertilized eggs could not be
distinguished from embryos that had been fertilized but had not developed beyond the 1-cell
stage.
