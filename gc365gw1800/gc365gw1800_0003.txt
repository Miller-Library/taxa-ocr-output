Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia
and Shick and by Hemela both used UV lamps as a source of ultraviolet radiation, which
provide a higher dose of radiation than would typically be experienced by an animal living in
the sunshine. More importantly, the embryos in their studies were exposed only to ultraviolet
radiation so as to accentuate any damage; no visible light was present, which would have
activated DNA repair by the photolyase system.
The goal of this research was to compare delays in time to early cleavage as well as
time to development to the tadpole hatching stage between embryos that retained the protection
afforded by the MAAs present in their follicle cells and in embryos where the MAA-containing
follicle cells had been removed. The embryos were exposed only to the radiation provided by
the midday spring sun.
My research demonstrated that there are no differences in either cleavage times or time
to tadpole hatching between intact or defolliculated eggs when natural sunlight is the UV
source. Two trials examining cleavage delay failed to turn up any significant mycosporine
effects, and of three tadpole hatching trials only the first demonstrated any effects of the follicle
cells, which were not repeatable in two subsequent studies. These results indicate that the
mycosporines in Ascidia follicle cells are not the only defense against ultraviolet radiation that
the embryos possess, and that these alternate defenses can compensate for the loss of the
putative follicle cell protection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection
Specimens of Ascidia ceratodes were collected from approximately the mean low-low
tide level of the pilings supporting Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, California. The animals
were stored in an aquarium continuously supplied with filtered aerated seawater from Monterey
Bay for a maximum of ten days.
