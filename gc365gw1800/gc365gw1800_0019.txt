Unger: Photoprotection in Ascidia

Figure 1:
Trial H1: Distribution of embryos not exposed to UV. The control embryos,
incubated under a filter that did not transmit UV, developed almost completely
to the 8-cell stage. 98.0% of the intact and 88.8% of the defolliculated embryos
had undergone the third cell division by the time of fixation, which for this trial
was 115 minutes after fertilization. 1.5% of the intact embryos and 5% of the
defolliculated embryos were still at the 4-cell stage. A total of 3656 embryos
were scored for all three treatments in this trial, 51.8% of which developed
beyond the 1-cell stage.
Figure 2:
Trial H1: Distribution of embryos exposed to UVA. Embryos exposed to UVA
showed a distribution similar to that of the control embryos: 97.0% of the intact
and 93.5% of the defolliculated embryos developed to the 8-cell stage by the
time of fixation. 1.4% of the intact embryos and 5.3% of the defolliculated
embryos were still at the 4-cell stage.
Figure 3:
Trial H1: Distribution of embryos exposed to UVAB. Embryos exposed to both
UVA and UVB were distributed similarly to the control group and the UVA
group, with a slight increase in the percentage of embryos still at the 4-cell
stage. 6.8% of the intact and 15.7% of the defolliculated embryos had only
undergone cleavage to the four-cell stage.
Figure 4:
Trial +2: Distribution of embryos not exposed to UV. The distribution of these
control embryos was centered around the 4-cell stage, while 41.8% of the intact
and 37.3% of the defolliculated embryos had cleaved into 8 cells. Embryos in
this trial were fixed 93 minutes after fertilization, and just 15.7% of the 9366
embryos scored for the trial developed beyond the 1-cell stage.
