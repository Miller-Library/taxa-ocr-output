Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
-5-
without the pressure gradient is 0.089 ml/m2/hour. The mean ourward
flow (ISO) with and without a hydrostatic head is 0.048 ml/cm/hour.
The difference is significant (student's t-test p£ 0.001). The approx¬
imate surface area of the whole anemone whose flow was previously measured
as 6.5ml/hour is 200 cm2. By extrapolation of these tritium data it
is seen that the anemone had a potential flow through the body wall of
8.2 ml/hour. Data from experiments e and f show that when tritium is
not used as a tracer no net flow across the body wall is observed.
DISCUSSION
The implanted tube and corresponding column of water, acting as
an extension of the anemone offers a means of easily monitoring the
internal pressure of Anthopleura xanthogrammica. The average measurement
of the unstimulated anemone's coelenteric pressure (10.Omm of sea water)
is higher than that recorded for Metridium senile (Batham and Pantin,
1950), 2.6 mm of water. Anthopleura xanthogrammica which inhabits an area
much closer to the zero tide level than does Metridium senile is likely
to experience relatively pronounced surf shock. The selective advantage
of a higher coelenteric pressure could be resistence to flexure under
the forces of the surf.
The posture assumed by a sea anemone is dependent of the balance
between coelenteric volume and muscular tension, i.e. pressure. A decrease
incoelenteric volume results in a decrease in coelenteric pressure (figure
6-a). That the rate of return of the pressure following an addition or
removal of water is large relative to the rate of return of the volume
indicates that for the anemone to maintain a specific posture a specific
pressure must be maintained.
