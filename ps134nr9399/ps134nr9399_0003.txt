Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
-3-
The anemone can move water into its coelenteron but lacks
the mechanism to expell it when its muscles are inactivated with MgClo
(figure 4).
B. In order to monitor flow as well as pressure over a longer period
of time the anemone was connected to a Grass Model 5 Polygraph. A
force transducer was used to measure flow and a pressure transducer
to measure pressure (see figure 5). The response of the animal to
addition and subtraction of coelenteric volume was recorded.
-Results-
Figure 6-a shows the polygraph reading from the pressure transÂ¬
ducer and figure 6-b readings from the transducer measuring flow.
After 2cc of water were removed from the anemone (x on figures 6-a,b)
therewas an immediate drop in pressure, a result of the change in volume.
Shortly thereafter there was a sharp increase in pressure which reached
an amplitude greater than that of the prestimulus reading. The pressure
then returned to the pre-stimulus value. Following the sharp decrease
in coelenteric volume (figure 6-b, point x) there is a slow positive,
with respect to the change in pressure, flow to the pre-stimulus volume.
Figures 6-c and 6-d show polygraph readings from the pressure transducer.
The increases in pressure at points xo and xl, x2, x3, x4, x5 result
from single and serial injections of 2cc of sea water into the anemone.
Note the return of the pressure values to pre-stimulus levels. Visual
observations revealed no gross posture changes due to water addition or
subtraction fromuthe anemone.
