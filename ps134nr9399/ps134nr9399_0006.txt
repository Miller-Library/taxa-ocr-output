Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
-6-
The results summarized in figures 3 and 4 suggest that while
the influx of water is not controlled muscularly, the coelenteric volume
and hence pressure and posture are. When the volume increases to the
upper limits for a specific posture there is muscular contraction and
concomitant deflation. The cyclical activity may in part explain the
rhythmic oscillation observed. A regulatory mechanism is implied for
queing muscular contraction and the accompanying deflation. Perhaps
it is a stretch and/or a pressure receptor in the anemone body wall.
The results from experiments testing the movement of water
through the anemone body wall are somewhat enigmatic. Results from the
tritium experiments indicate that there is undoubtedly movement of
tritiated water through the body wall. Simple diffusion as the sole
mechanism can be discounted as flux through RSO tissue is up to
40% greater than that through ISO tissue. This is further supported by
the fact that there is movement of water up a hydrostatic head. The
assumption was made that tritiated water could be tsûed as a tracer
because it had the same properties as normal water. However, when non¬

accounted for by gradients created by unequal ciliary activity on each
side of the tissue.
The following experiments are suggested in hopes that they
will clarify the observed results. 1) Create an apparatus such that
net flow can be monitored by observation of a bubble in a pipette (as
in experiments e and f) and movement of tritium monitored by sample
taking and disintegrations measured. 2) Repeat experiments a through
d while stirring continually and after ciliary activity has been stopped.
It is important for the understanding of anemone biology that
