Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
-2-
taken. Readings were taken daily for ten days and once weekly for the
following three weeks in normal unstimulated situations as well as after
prodding.
-Results-
No leakage around the tube was observed when a solution of
methylene blue in sea water (Fisher Sci. Co. M-291) was injected into
the coelenteron.
1) Resting pressure (unstimulated) varied between 9 and 11 mm
of sea water. The mean was 10.0 mm.
2) In response to prodding (fast closure) the maximum hydro¬
static head measured was 30 mm of sea water.
II. Monitoring of water movement through Anthopleura xanthogrammica
A. An Anthopleua xanthogrammica was cannulated as described in
part I and allowed to settle onto a plexyglass plate. After a 24 hour
period of recovery from the MgClo as well as immediately following the
MgClo exposure the cannula was connected toa flow meter. An air bubble
was introduced into a 1 cc pipette; flow was taken to be the displacement
of the bubble with time (see figure 2). Visual readings were taken
once per minute for 140 minutes.
The anemone and flow meter were in a running sea water aquarium
whose temperature was 11° Centigrade.
-Results-
Rhythmic oscillations are evident in a plot of bubble dis¬
placement versus time (figure 3). The mean period of eight peaks is
18.3 minutes (standard error 0.71). The maximum rate recorded was
6 ml of water per hour
