Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica

this question be resolved. Differential movement of water suggests that
there is some sort of pump present, sodium perhaps. The role of the
siphonoglyph come into question. Perhaps the use of tritium is inapproÂ¬
priate in such experiments.
SUMMARY
1. Anthopleura xanthogrammica, in an unstimulated stae, maintains a
positive coelenteric pressure whose mean is 10.0 mm of sea water
(n= 13). In response to prodding a maximum pressure of 30 mm of sea water
was measured. This high maintained pressure, relative to that of
Metridium senile, may have adaptive signigicance.
2. Rhythmic oscillations of flow have been observed. Evidence indicates
that deflation is muscularly controlled and inflation not.
3. Evidence suggests that a pressure is important for particular position-
al configuration and that there is some regulatory mechanism, perhaps
stretch of pressure receptors in the body wall.
4.- There is transport (not simple diffusion) of tritiated water through
the body wall into the coelenteron. Possibilities of sodium and/or water
pumps exist. Transport of water through the body wall challenges present
theory of anemone hydrodynamics..
5. A final theory of water movement through the body wall is presently
not submittable because of conflicting results of movement of tritiated
and non-tritiated water.
