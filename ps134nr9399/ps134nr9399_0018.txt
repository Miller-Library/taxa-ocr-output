Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1. Cannulated anemone and apparatus used to measure internal
pressures. The mean pressure recorded was lOmm of sea water.
Figure 2. Cannulated anempne connected to a pipette flow meter.
Visual readings of the displacement of the air bubble with time
were taken.
Figure 3. Displacement of the air bubble in the pipette flow meter
versus time. Values of displacement are relative to the base line.
The absolute value of the base line has not been determined. Note
the rhythmin oscillations, with a mean period of 18.3 minutes. A
maximum positive flow rate of 6 ml/hour can be discerned. An upward
trend in the graph indicated flow into the coelenteron.
Figure 4. Displacement of the air bubble in the pipette flow meter
versus time for the animal whose muscles have been inactivated with
MgCl.. Displacement values are relative to the base line. The absol¬
ute value of the base line has not been determined. Point A indicates
the observation of an air bubble leaving the mouth of the anemone.

graph. Pressure and flow were measured. A is a vessel attached to a
force transducer-flow into this vessel was used as a means of monitoring
flow into and out of the anemone. B is a pressure transducer.
Figure 6. A--readings from the pressure transducer. B--coincident
readings from the flow meter. X--marks the removal of 2cc of sea
water from the coelenteron. Note relative rates of increase in A
and B after the water removal. C--recordings from the pressure trans¬
