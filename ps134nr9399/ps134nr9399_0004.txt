Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
-4-
The body wall tissue of an anaesthetized animal was stretched
to about twice its anaesthetized size around the end of a 1.5 cm
internal diameter flanged glass tube. The tissue was securely fastened
and sealed with waxed string. From three to gight tubes were made
per animal. The tube was placed in running sea water for 12-16 hours,
Various modifications were made; 1) tissue Right Side Out (RSO), the
interior portion of the body wall was on the inside of tube B (see
figure 7), with and without a hydrostatic head of 9mm (to approximate
the internal pressure of the anemone), 2) tissue Inside Out (ISO), the
exterior portion of the body wall was on the inside of tube B, with and
without a hydrostatic head.
A series of six experiments were conducted, usually with
replicate tubes in each experiment, see table 1. All tubes in each
experiment were from the same animal. Experiments were performed at
room temperature with sea water filtered through fl filter paper unless
otherwise indicated. Samples taken during -experimentation were taken
from vessel B, after mixing and replaced with equal volumes of sea
water.
-Results-
The results from experiments a through f are summarized in
table 2. These experiments show that there is movement of tritiated water
through the body wall, whether or not the tissue is stretched or un¬
stretched. In every experimental animal (RSO) movement up the hydrostatic
head is greater than movement through the tissue without the pressure
gradient. Movement of water from the inside to the outside of the anem¬
one (ISO) is up to 40% slower. The mean inward flow (RSO) with and
