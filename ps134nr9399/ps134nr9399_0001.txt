Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
-1-
It has been reported that the siphonoglyph of the sea anemone
Metridium marginatum pumps water into the coelenteron (Parker, 1919).
Batham and Pantin (1950) have monitored coelenteric pressures for
Metridium senile. In general however, a limited amount of research
has been devoted to the hydrodynamics of the sea anemone. My invesÂ¬
tigation has been directed at various aspects of the hydrodynamics
of the sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammica. Internal pressures have
been measured, flow rates determined and movement of water through the
body wall' monitored.
MATERIALS
The Anthopleura xanthogrammica studied were collected inter-
tidally off of Monterey California and were kept in running sea water
aquaria for no more than three weeks prior to use.
ETHODS AND RESULT:
I.
An Anthopleura xanthogrammica was anaesthetized in MgClo-H20
for one hour. After which an incision was made in the center of the
pedal disk and a 1.5 cm (external diameter) plastic tube was inserted
(see figure 1). The lengths of the incision extending beyond the tube
were sewn with surgical thread to close the tissue around the tube.
The anemone was then allowed to settle on a piece of styrofoam with
the tube extending through a hole in the styrofoam.
With twelve hours allowed for recovery from the MgClo, the
system was inverted and measurements of the hydrostatic head were
