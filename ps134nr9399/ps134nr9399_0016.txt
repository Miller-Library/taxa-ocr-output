Hydrodynamics of Anthopleura xanthogrammica
TABLE I
A. Five tubes were set up, in each instance vessel A contained sea
water to which tritiated water was added (10-2 mci/ml) and vessel B
normal sea water.
tubes 1, 2, 3, were RSO with 9mm hydrostatic head
tubes 4, 5, were RSO without a hydrostatic head
B. Eight tubes were set up. Set-up was as in A
tubes 1, 2, RSO w/o hydrostatic head
Tubes 3, 4*, RSO w/ hydrostatic head
tubes 5, 6, ISO w/o hydrostatic head
tubes 7, 8, ISO w/ hydrostatic head
C. Eight Tubes were set up as in A and B above
tubes 1*, 2*, RSO w/o hydrostatic head
tubes 3, 4, RSO W/ hydrostatic head
tubes 5*, 6, ISO w/o hydrostatic head
tubes 7, 8, ISO w/ hydrodtatic head
D. Six tubes were set up as above
tubes 1, 2, RSO w/o hydrostatic head tissue unstretched
tubes 3*, 4, RSO w/o hydrostatic head tissue stretched
tubes 5, 6, ISO w/o hydrostatic head
E. Five tubes were set up and connected to a lec pipette. Readings
were taken for six hours. For experimental set-up see figure 7.
F. Six tubes were set up, three from one animal and three from another.
Set-up same as E above.
