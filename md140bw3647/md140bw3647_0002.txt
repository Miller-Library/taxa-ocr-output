SHOWEN: DEFENSE RESPONSE OF ARCTONOE VITTATA
contact with the edge of the Diadora shell. Often
the starfish would move itself upon the glass, coverÂ¬
ing a large part of the shell. Muring the ten minute
trial period notes were taken on the movements of the
starfish, the host and the commensal.
Starfish Water Experiment: To determine if either the
host's mantle response or water which had contacted
Pisaster could cause a worm to search without direct
contact of the starfish to the limpet, two starfish
were introduced to test aquaria but not permitted to
contact the host. The animals were observed for ten
minutes.
"Diadora Juice" Experiments: Five limpets and an isolated
worm were placed in a small plastic tray of sea water
and a seastar was touched to the worm. Observation
was for ten minutes in each of three trials.
Additionally, mucus and seawater from the mantle cavity
of a Diadora in which a mantle response had been
previously elicited by a starfish was pipetted onto an
isolated Arctonoe in contact with a seastar. The
worms were observed for three minutes in each of five
trials.
MgCl. Experiment: In order to test for the necessity
of the physical movement of the mantle response for
biting to occur limpets with their worms removed
were placed in isotonic Mgcly solution, an anaesthetic,
for several hours. The relaxed Diadora were then
placed upside down in aquaria and held in place with
a lump of clay. The worms were then returned to the
hosts and after the worm was settled a starfish was
placed in contact with it. The observation period was
ten minutes in each of three trials.
