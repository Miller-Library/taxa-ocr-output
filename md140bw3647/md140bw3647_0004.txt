SHOWEN: DEFENSE RESPONSE OF ARCTONOE VITTAT
the shell and display the searching behavior described
by Dimock and Dimock. Nine worms never showed any
search activity at all. While a few worms moved
directly towards the tube feet, as described by Dimock
and Dimock, many seemed to be searching randomly.
Twelve worms showed search behavior but never contacted
a starfish and bit. Only if the starfish was within
a centimeter or two was the worm able to pinpoint the
point of tube foot contact. Nine of the worms, upon
contact with a tube foot, ran their palps along the
tube foot and everted their proboscis and bit, often
holding on to the tube foot for several seconds.
All data following applies to marked worms only.
Starfish Water Experiment: The three limpets displayed
the mantle response when near but not touching the
Pisasters. All the worms displayed search behavior.
Four worms with palps removed also showed searching
behavior using the same test procedure. Additionally,
this searching behavior was observed at least ten times
when water in which starfish had been kept was allowed
to flow into aquaria containg Diadora with commensal
worms.
"Diadora Juice" Experiment: In five experiments in which
fluid from the mantle cavity was applied to an isolated
worm in contact with a Pisaster, no aggressive behavior
occurred and no increase in activity was noted. The worm
often remained among or next to the tube feet.
In three trials in which an isolated Arctonoe vittata
was placed in contact with a Pisaster in seawater with
five disturbed Diadora, no searching or aggressive
behavior by any worm occurred.
MgCl, Experiment: Arctonoe returned to Diadora rendered
limp from MgCly treatment behaved normally, although
they were not as protected as in a normal limpet.
