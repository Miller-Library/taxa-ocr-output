SHOWEN:DEFENSE RESPONSE OF ARCTONOE VITTATA
is not adequate to elicit searching. Some cue from the
iadora must be missing, either a physical movement, a
chemical released during the mantle response, or a
chemical the effects of which are negated by Mgcl2.
It was observed that Arctonoe on normal limpets either
isaster
in contact with or merely in the same tank with
will search only after initiation of the mantle
response. This confirms that mere presence of a seastar
in the environment will not elicit searching, and
indicates that some aspect of the mantle response must
initiate search behavior. Dimock and Dimock did not
observe that worms searched on limpets exposed to
seawater in which starfish had been kept. However,
Margolin (1964) reports that 100% of Diadora tested
gave the mantle response in reaction to seastar water
whereas only one of ten limpets did so in the Dimocks
experiment.
That worms do not become aroused either in the presence
of disturbed Diadora or upon direct application of mucus
from a disturbed limpet indicate that: 1. No water
soluble substance released from Diadora during the
mantle response or insoluble substance in the mucus
is responsible for initiating searchinging. 2. There is
no chemical whose effects are negated by Mgcl,. The
physical movement of the mantle is necessarry and
sufficient to elicit searching.
That worms will bite on MgCl, treated limpet or in a
gelatin groove once contacted by a tube foot indicates
that the worm must merely be in a groove and directly
contact a starfish for biting to occur.
Experiments involving worms without palps dekmonstrate
palps are not needed for detection of or reaction to
a Pisaster but that they are required for proper
coordination of the bite.
Biting then results from a two part behavior; searching
