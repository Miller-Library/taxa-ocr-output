SHOWEN:DEFENSE RESPONSE OF ARCTONOE
When a starfish was touched to the limpet but not the
worm, the Arctonoe always remained inactive. Only when
the tube feet actually contacted the prostomial region
did the worm become aroused and exhibit searching be-
havior. This resulted in biting in three of the six
worms tested.
Gelatin Groove Experiment: The response of Arctonoe
in a gelatin groove was similar to their behavior on
a limpet treated with Mgol√∏ solution.
Again, in six trials the worms never turned in the di-
rection of a tube foot, stretched out towards a tube foot,
or bit until the prostomial region was touched with
a tube foot. Six worms remained in the gelatin groove
for ten minutes; three of them bit. Approximately two
thirds of the worms left the groove before ten minutes.
Worms did not remain in gelatin preparations more than
several hours old, possibly due to the presence of
increased numbers of microorganisms.
Palps Excised Experiment: Worms with palps removed
behaved like normal worms with one important exception.
Two of seven
ctonoe tested made attempts at biting;
both of them missed the tube feet. This phenomenon was
also observed informally on three other occasions. No
worms missing palps was ever observed to successfully
bite a tube foot.
DISCUSSION:
The fact that Arctone bearing a dark band bite signi-
cantly more than unmarked worms indicates the two
sympatric groups vary in more than one genetic trait.
If this indicates gene isolation between the forms is
not yet known.
Dimock and Dimock indicated the presence of a Pisaster
is insufficient to cause biting in an isolated worm.
Some stimulus, associated with the presence of the
host is required.
That worms do not search on MgClz treated limpets
indicates that mere presence of the host and starfish
