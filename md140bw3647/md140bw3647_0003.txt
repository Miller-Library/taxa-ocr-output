SHOWEN: DEFENSE RESPONSE OF ARCTONOE VITTATA
Gelatin Groove Experiment: To test for the necessity of
the Diadora's presence for biting to occur an arm of
a starfish was touched to the anterior portion of an
Arctonoe placed in a shallow groove in fresh, firm
g dry gelatin in 100 ml seawater). The groove was
roughly "worm sized" in all dimensions, so as to allow
the worm to fit in snuggly. Tests were scored only it the
worm remained in the groove for the ten minte trial
period. As a control isolated worms were tested against
a starfish on a gelatin surface without a groove. The
observation period for the control experiments was also
ten minutes for each of five trials.
Palps Excised Experiment: Worms without palps were
tested using the "Basic Experiment" procedure.
RESULT
The Arctonoe vittata were variable in their markings.
One type had the posterior edge of the first pair of
elytra marked with a black or brown band, whereas the
other type had no such marking. Except for this marking,
the worms were white or cream colored. None of the worms
had the dark band across segments seven and eight
commonly associated with the species yet prostomial and
parapodial characteristics are those of A. vittata.
Eight of 17 marked worms were observed to bite whereas
only one of 12 unmarked bit. The difference is signiÂ¬
ficant at the .025 level according to the G-test.
Prior to the introduction of the seastar the worm was
generally motionless in the mantle cavity, with its
dark tipped palps usually retracted but occasionally
extended and waving. After introduction of the star-
fish the Arctonoe would remain motionless until the
onset of the mantle response. The first response of the
worm noted was waving of its palps and the anterior
portion of its body. It would then emerge from beneath
