SHOWEN: DEFENSE RESPONSE OF ARCTONOE VITTATA
INTRODUCTION:
The keyhole limpet Diadora aspera (Eschscholtz, 1833) is
one of the many hosts of the scaleworm Arconoe vittata.
(Grube, 1955). Margolin (1964) found that Diadora raises
its membranous, frilled mantle, virtually covering its
shell in response to contact with a predatory seastar
or upon exposure to seawater in which a seastar had been
kept.
Dimock and Dimock (1972) report that A. vittata will bite
the tube feet of various seastars, including Pisaste:
ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) following seastar-limpet con-
tact and initiation of the mantle response. They also
present evidence that no substance released from Diadora
was involved in eliciting the response from A. vittata
and that a worm isolated from its host would not bite
a starfish. Their paper was a brief note based on small
sample size. I here further elucidate the mechanism of
this behavior.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Diadora aspera, two to five cm in length, with commensal
ctonoe vittata were collected during April and May of
1976 from a submerged rocky outcropping known as the
Pinnacles (36°33' North by 121°58' West) in 70 to 95
feet of water. Intertidal Pisaster ochraceus were used
as the test animals. Animals were kept in aquaria with
running sea water at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California. Due to the difficulty in collecting
numbers of 4 vittata most worms were used in more than
one experiment.
Basic Experiment: D. aspera with commensal worms were
placed on glass and observed from the underside, rather
than in enameled trays from above as in Dimock and
Dimocks work. An arm of a Pisaster was brought into
