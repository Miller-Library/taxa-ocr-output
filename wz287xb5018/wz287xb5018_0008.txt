membrane anteriorly, but is free posteriorly. The com¬

plex movements of the odontophore are controlled by
striated musculature acting on the four radular "carti¬
lages.
The disposition of the rest of the digestive system is
seen in outline in Figure 9. There are three main regions:
the foregut, composed of buccal cavity and esophagus;
the stomach and digestive gland, which comprise the mid¬

The areas of the posterior visceral hump occupied by
the digestive gland and gonad vary somewhat from spec-

not treated with magnesium chloride, peristaltic move¬
