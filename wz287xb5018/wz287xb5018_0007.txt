ria seem to indicate that they are tactile, and perhaps
olfactory, receptors. An active animal will be seen to draw
its tentacles repeatedly over the substrate as it advances.
Resting animals either “caress“ their shells with the ten-
tacles, or gently wave them. In the presence of predaceous
asteroids such as Pisaster ochraceus (BRANDT, 1835), T.
funebralis waves cephalic and epipodial tentacles vigor¬
ously while trying to escape; Mc GEE (unpubl.) has noted
a similar response in Tegula brunnea (PHILIPPI, 1848) ex-
OS-
posed to spawning males of their own species.

The epithelium of the epipodial tentacles is heavily pig¬
mented; distally it forms papillae bearing non-motile sen¬

sory cilia. Similar cilia are found on the tentacles of other
prosobranchs (FRETTER & GRAHAM, 1962, p. 313) and on
the oral tentacles of the nudibranch Hermissenda (AGERS-
BORG, 1925). Passing down the length of the tentacle is
à large central nerve, longitudinal muscle bands, and an
