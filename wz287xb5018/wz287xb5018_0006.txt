these neck lobes may be the removal of particles expelled
from the mantle cavity, though FRETTER & GRAHAM

(1962, p. 532) state that the neck lobes of British trochids
are rolled into half-siphons for channeling water in and
out of the mantle cavity. No evidence of this was seen in

Tegula funebralis.
Beneath the overhang of each neck lobe are from one

to ten anterior papillae, each with a central spot of ciliated
unpigmented epithelium (Fig. 3). They retract slightly

that they may be sensory receptors.

the first epipodial tentacle on the right side does not bear
such a papilla. The other three tentacles on each side
bear papillae (Fig. 4). The epipodial tentacles are similar
