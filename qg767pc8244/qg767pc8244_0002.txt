shelf, and Laqueus californianus var. vancouverensis and
Terebratulina crossei, from the walls of the Monterey Submarine
Canyon. Only one published study of deep sea brachiopods has ever
focused on reproduction and development (Rokop 1977);
reproduction and development in these three species has never been
the subject of a published paper.
It is possible that brachiopods will be used as model organisms
to raise to settlement to provide juveniles for experimental
transplant studies to various deep sea habitats. Brachiopods are
ideal for this purpose because of their abundance in the deep sea and
their ability to survive in aquaria. Furthermore, they are sessile
organisms, have a short developmental cycle and different species
are variable in abundance with habitat and depth.
The aim of this study was to develop methods for in vitro
fertilization of eggs and rearing them through to settlement. L. c.
vancouverensis and T. crossei were successfully fertilized in vitro
and reared to swimming larvae.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens were collected from Monterey canyon between
October, 1992 and May 1993 using a ROV (Remotely Operated
Vehicle) operated from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute research vessel. L. californianus was found at a depth of
100-200 m, with total cover of its substrate, often attached to each
other in large chains. L. c. vancouverensis was found at a depth of
500-700 m and T. crossei at depths of 350-700m, in clusters and
