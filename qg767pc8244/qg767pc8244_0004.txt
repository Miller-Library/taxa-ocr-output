volume were removed from the beaker (also of known volume) and
the eggs were counted under a compound microscope.
The eggs were allowed to soak for 10-15 hours to facilitate the
loss of the follicle cells. Then the male's testes were removed and
placed in 15-25 mL of sea water brought to pH 9.0 with NHAOH. The
gonads were macerated and after about 15 minutes a sample of the
sperm solution was checked under 450X magnification for sperm
motility. Once motility was observed, the sperm solution was added
to the egg solution and stirred to facilitate fertilization. In most
cases, the water over the eggs was decanted and replaced an hour
after fertilization to prevent polyspermy.
Following fertilization, samples of eggs were viewed
periodically under a compound microscope to check for cleavage.
The water over the fertilized eggs was refreshed daily by decanting
it through a piece of 100 um Nitex to avoid pouring off embryos or
larva.
RESULTS
The fecundity and egg size of each of the three species
examined is compared in table 1.
Size distribution by ventral valve length of the males and
females of each species used in the study is given in figures 1 and 2.
With the small data set used to calculate the fecundity values,
there was not enough information to determine a correlation
between the ventral valve length and fecundity.
