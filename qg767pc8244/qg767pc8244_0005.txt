Table 2 compares the observed developmental times of T.
crossei and L. c. vancouverensis to other known species.
Terebratulina crossei
See table 3 for the environmental conditions of each of the
fertilizations of T. crossei.
The white to slightly yellowish gonads of T. crossei are often
visible through the shell. There are two branches on both the dorsal
and ventral valves, the dorsal branches being slightly smaller than
the ventral branches. The branches are lacy looking and somewhat
bushy (see figure 3). No unripe gonads were encountered and it
appears to be impossible to determine sex by external
characteristics.
Successful fertilization of T. crossei was achieved on three
occasions. In each case, the eggs were soaked prior to fertilization
for a period of 14 h - 14 h 15 min. and were fertilized and incubated
at a temperature of 5 Â°C. Figures 4-6 illustrates the various stages of
development observed.
Most unfertilized eggs were predominantly opaque with a
bumpy membrane surrounding them and a small polar body
protruding from one side. However, a few had a dark center
surrounded by a clear sac. Because it was impossible to remove all
sperm by decanting after one hour, it was also impossible to know
exactly when any specific fertilization took place or how long it took
the fertilized egg to reach any given stage of development. It was
determined that the first cleavage occurred sometime before 10
