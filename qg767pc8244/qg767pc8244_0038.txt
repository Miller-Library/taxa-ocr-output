ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We would like to thank our advisor Jim Barry for creating this
project and keeping us well stocked with brachiopods; Chuck Baxter
for his suggestions and the fact that he was always truly excited to
see a cleaved brachiopod egg; Dr. Dan Mazia for his help in getting
our sperm to move; Kurt Buck for his assistance on microscopic
photography and his undying wit; Dr. Richard Strathmann at Friday
Harbor Laboratories for his advice and reassurance; Dr. David Epel
for letting us borrow his pH meter and ammonium hydroxide; Judy
Connor for patiently searching the ROV footage for us; Molly
Cummings and the rest of the 1993 Bio 175H students for being such
a cool and crazy group of people.
Dana-Lynn would like to especially thank her house mates, Linda,
Christine, and Maria for making 122 18th St. so much more than just
a place to sleep. From now on, whenever I drink Citrus Punch or eat
Stove Top, lâ€™Il think of you guys. I would also like to thank Jim for
patiently enduring my attempts to get him to lab before noon and for
his real enthusiasm for and knowledge of all the critters in the deep
sea lab-it was catching. Finally, I thank God for using this quarter
to teach me to: "Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In
everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.'
I Thessalonians 5:16-18
Jim would like to thank Chuck Baxter again, who has helped me
figure out what I want in life; my parents, Jim and Sylvia, who have
supported me in whatever ventures I have embarked upon; Dana
Lynn, for putting up with my idiosyncrasies; and all of the
brachiopods, great and small, who sacrificed their lives to make this
project possible. Thank you all!
