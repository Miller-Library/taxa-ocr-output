This table lists the fecundity and average egg size for each of the
species studied, and some relevant literature values. It should be
noted that the Laqueus californianus data was taken form
individuals with immature eggs while the eggs of the other two
species were mature. Standard deviations for egg size for L. c.
californianus, and T. crossei could not be calculated, for although
multiple eggs were observed, only an average size was recorded
rather than individual sizes. NA indicates information is not
available.
