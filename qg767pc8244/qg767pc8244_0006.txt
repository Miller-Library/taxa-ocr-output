hours post fertilization, however, no observations were made
between 0 and 10 hours. The morula stage was first observed at
12.5 h and the embryo developed into a blastula by 36 h. The
embryos developed into tri-lobed, counterclockwise-rotating larva
around 164 hrs after fertilization. Mature larvae were seen 200
hours post fertilization.
It is interesting to note that the bumpy membrane first
observed surrounding the unfertilized egg was present until the free
swimming stage. However, as development progressed the
membrane seemed to diminish in thickness. Perhaps a related
observation is that when bacteria infestation occurred, the blastula
seemed much more susceptible to attack and subsequent degradation
than did the unfertilized eggs.
Laqueus californianus vancouverensis
See table 4 for the environmental conditions surrounding the
fertilizations of L. c. vancouverensis.
The gonads of L. c. vancouverensis line both valves with two
parallel branches on each side of the ventral valve and one branch
on each side of the dorsal valve (figure 3). In general, females
gonads are salmon or pinkish while males are paler and beigish, but
color is not a reliable indicator of sex. Ripe gonads are plump and
somewhat fluffy looking whereas immature, or spent gonads are
brownish and pencil-thin. In some cases it is possible to see the
gonads through the shell, but this is not always true.
