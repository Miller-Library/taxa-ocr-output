Fertilization of L. c. vancouverensis was attempted over a
range of egg soaking times (12 h 5 min. - 15 h 45 min.) and
temperatures (2 °C - 11 °C). However, successful fertilization seemed
to occur only when the water temperature was maintained at 5 °C
from egg maceration through fertilization and development. In one
successful fertilization the eggs were soaked for 13 h 15 min. and in
the other for 15 h 45 min. In the first case, embryos at the 2- and 8-
cell stages were observed 23 h 45 min. and 26 h 15 min. after
fertilization respectively. In the second case, free swimming larvae
were observed and photographed approximately 100 h after
fertilization, yet, no earlier observations of fertilization were made.
Figures 7-9 illustrates the various stages of development observed.
Three larvae were observed at 100 h. One swam freely and
quickly throughout the water sample, a second moved little but
continually butted its apical lobe against the side of the dish and a
third possessed motile cilia but seemed to be in the pre-setae stage.
In several of the fertilization attempts, structures resembling a
loosely held together blastula were observed. Although these
structures appear to be slightly irregular and ill-formed, there is a
slight possibility that they are in fact blastulae, however, as of yet,
none of them has been followed and observed to develop to the
larval stage.

fertilization attempts of L. californianus.
