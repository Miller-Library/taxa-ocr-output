small groups respectively. The boundaries of Laqueus and
Terebratulina overlap, and have been found together. This has been
seen in previous studies as well (Tunnicliffe and Wilson 1988)
Specimens were identified using a key by Bernard (1971) and
confirmed with a guide by Hertlein and Grant (1944). All specimens
were maintained in aquaria with chilled recirculating sea water at
approximately 5 °C until used.
Preliminary sexing of individuals was accomplished by
squeezing the brachiopod gently at the lateral sides to open the shell
a few millimeters and peeking through the gap to visually inspect
the gonads lining the mantle cavity for the presence of eggs. The
female’s gonads were full, fluffy and soft-looking compared to the
male’s. To confirm the gender, the specimen was squeezed again,
and fine forceps were used to remove a small piece of gonadal tissue
for viewing under the compound microscope. Males were identified
primarily by the absence of eggs, but it was possible to see sperm as
well under higher magnification. Upon positive identification of sex,
the individual was opened by inserting a scalpel through the gap and
severing the diductor muscle from the ventral valve. The two valves
were then easily pulled apart to reveal the gonads lining the mantle
cavity of both valves.
Once opened, a female’s gonads were macerated through 247
Um Nitex and allowed to soak in 300-450 mL of sea water. Once the
eggs settled to the bottom of the beaker most of the supernatant sea
water was decanted and replaced with fresh sea water. At this time,
fecundity measurements were taken by first stirring the egg water
to ensure an equal distribution of eggs. Several aliquots of known
