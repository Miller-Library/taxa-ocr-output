This table presents the number of hours post fertilization when
various developmental events occur. The Terebratalia transversa,
Terebratulina unguicula and Hemithyris Psittacea data is taken from
Long (1964). The Terebratulina crossei and Laqueus californianus
vancouverensis values, which are original, give the time at which
each stage was first observed. It is possible, however, that the
developing embryo reached a given stage prior to the actual time of
observation. NA indicates data that was not available.
