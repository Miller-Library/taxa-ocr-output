ABSTRACT
This study focused on the reproduction and development of
three articulate brachiopods to enable rearing of young in the lab
which could later be used for transplant studies in the deep sea. The
three brachiopods studied are Terebratulina crossei, Laqueus
californianus var. vancouverensis and Laqueus californianus.
Specimens of each were collected from Monterey Canyon using a ROV
and maintained in chilled aquaria. Fertilization was accomplished by
stripping gonads from both sexes, macerating them through Nitex
and combining them in vitro. Successful fertilization of both T.
crossei and L. c. vancouverensis was achieved at 5Â°C and embryos
were raised to the larval stage.
INTRODUCTION
Most of the early work on deep sea species involved taxonomic
and distributional studies. Over the last few decades, scientists and
engineers have developed more sophisticated methods of studying
and sampling the organisms living in the deep ocean. Currently,
submersibles and remotely operated vehicles (ROVS) enable
scientists to observe deep sea organisms in their natural
environment and collect them unharmed for lab experiments such as
this one.
This study focuses on reproduction and development in three
articulate brachiopods: Laqueus californianus, from the continental
