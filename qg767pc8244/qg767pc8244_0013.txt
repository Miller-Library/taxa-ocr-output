Of the three species studied, only L. californianus seems to be
a poor candidate for deep sea studies. This is partly due to the fact
that it is generally found in shallower water than the other two
species and partly because fertilization attempts were unsuccessful.
Perhaps, if ripe oocytes were found in L. californianus, it too could
have also been successful. Both T. crossei and L. c. vancouverensis
show potential as model organisms for the study of larval settlement
and distribution. T. crossei were easy to fertilize and achieved a fair
fertilization rate and a good yield of larvae. L. c. vancouverensis is
more common in the Monterey Submarine Canyon, more easily
sexed, and reaches the larval stage more rapidly. Keeping the
characteristics of each species in mind and finding ways to increase
the rate of fertilization and decipher the potential bacteria problem,
both of these species could prove valuable in a variety of studies
exploring the processes and interactions which occur in the deep
ocean.
