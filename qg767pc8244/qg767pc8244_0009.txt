into the mantle cavity and expelled by an exhalant current of the
lophophore. This fertilization strategy is effective because most
articulates occur in dense patches, sometimes even attaching to one
anotherâ€™s shells. Females of brooding species release their eggs into
the mantle cavity. Sperm are believed to be taken in through the
inhalant current of the lophophore, and the fertilized eggs are
maintained in a brood pouch or among the tentacles of the
lophophore (Long and Stricker 1991).
Once fertilization occurs, cleavage is holoblastic, nearly equal,
radial and somewhat asynchronous (Long and Stricker 1991).
Cleavages beyond the 8-cell stage in articulates are often irregular
and asynchronous (Conklin 1902). Despite irregular cleavage, these
tend to develop normally, becoming blastula and eventually, free
swimming larvae. The mature larvae of articulate brachiopods are
tripartite, possessing an apical lobe, a mantle lobe, and a pedicle lobe.
When a suitable substrate is found, a mature larvae begins the
process of metamorphosis (Reed 1987). Suitable substrates include
the shell of an adult brachiopod, the shell of bivalve mollusks, or the
tube of the polychaete Sabellaria cementarium. Metamorphosis
involves the reversal of the mantle lobe and the attachment of the
pedicle lobe to a suitable substrate (Long and Stricker 1991).
Metamorphosis may also be induced by placing mature larvae in
high K+ sea water (Freeman 1993). Within 24 hours of
metamorphosis, the mantle has secreted a bivalved protegulum, and
within 4 days post-metamorphosis, the beginnings of a new shell
have begun to form around the edges of the protegulum. (Stricker
and Reed 1985).
