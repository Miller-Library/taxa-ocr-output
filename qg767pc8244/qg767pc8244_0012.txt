counterparts and reaches the larval stage around the same time as
Terebratalia transversa and Terebratulina unguicula (Long 1964).
Egg soaking time is believed to be a second factor in
vancouverensis fertilization. Although the range of acceptable
soaking times is likely broader than these results indicate, eggs
soaked for approximately 13-16 h prior to fertilization are known to
be viable. Eggs which are stripped from the specimens (as opposed
to being spawned) seem to require this amount of time to shed their
follicle cells.
Further studies with L. c. vancouverensis should incorporate a
better system for checking for fertilization (e.g. petri dish under a
high power dissecting microscope). If fertilized eggs could be
separated early on in the developmental process, they would be
much easier to follow.
Laqueus californianus
The spawning season of L. californianus is unknown however,
all the L. californianus eggs observed were quite small and
irregularly shaped, thus it is believed that the specimens in captivity
had spawned prior to collection. Thus, most oocytes remaining in the
gonads were immature and not yet capable of participating in
successful fertilization. Another problem could have been that all
fertilization attempts were attempted at 5 °C, while L. californianus
lives at temperatures of 9 or 10 °C.
