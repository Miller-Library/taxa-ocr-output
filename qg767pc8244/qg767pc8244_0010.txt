Terebratulina crossei
T. crossei was relatively easy to fertilize in vitro and
developed at a reasonable pace to the blastula stage when it
suddenly seemed to cease development completely. However, after
approximately 164 hours several rotating larva were finally
discovered. Although the reason for this apparent slowing in the
developmental process is unknown, it may be related to the fact that
some species of Terebratulina are known to brood their young (Long
1964, Conklin 1902). If T. crossei is one of these species, the female
may hold the developing embryos in her brood pouch for several
days, protecting them from the harsh deep sea environment and
releasing them only when they reach the larva stage. Whereas, non-
brooded embryos may need to mature more quickly in order to
survive in the open ocean, brooded embryos would experience less
environmental pressure to develop quickly and would thus be
expected to develop more slowly. This phenomenon is seen in
another brooding species Hemithyris psittacea, which takes 187 hour
before setae develop on the mantle lobe, and a full 200 hours elapse
before metamorphosis is initiated (Long 1964)
The fact that T. crossei was observed at nearly all major stages
of development from fertilization to larva is quite significant for
several reasons. First, it is quite reasonable to believe that T. crossei
could be successfully raised in significant numbers in the lab and
used as a model organism for the study of environmental processes.
Further research would need to focus on inducing metamorphosis
