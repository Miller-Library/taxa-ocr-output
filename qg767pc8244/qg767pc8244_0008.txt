The gonads of L. californianus were quite similar in
appearance to those of L. c. vancouverensis but tended to be more
deeply or intensely colored. Furthermore, the gonads of several of
the specimens were blotchy in appearance: thick in some areas and
pencil thin in others (figure 3). Finally, the eggs seemed quite small
and immature compared to those of the other species, and the
literature values for Laqueus. All of the fertilizations attempted with
these specimens were unsuccessful.
DISCUSSION
Most articulate brachiopods, including those studied here, are
dioecious. In previous studies, males and females have been shown
to exist in a 1:1 ratio (James et al., 1992). Some articulates are free
spawning, while others brood their larvae. L. californianus has been
shown to be free spawning (Reed 1987), as is Terebratulina retusa
(James et al. 1992) while Terebratulina unguicula (Long 1964) and
Terebratulina septentrionalis (Conklin 1902) have been shown to
brood their larvae inside the lophophore. In either breeding
strategy, articulate brachiopods produce demersal lecithotrophic
larvae, which have a brief free swimming phase before
metamorphosis.
Spawning has rarely been observed in brachiopods, and the
natural cues for spawning remain unclear. However, in some species
spawning can be induced by agitation, slight elevation of water
temperature, or the addition of sperm suspensions (James et al.,
1992, Long 1964). Gametes are released through the metanephridia
