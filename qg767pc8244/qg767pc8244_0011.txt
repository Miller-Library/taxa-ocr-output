and on increasing the fertilization rate. Secondly, if T. crossei is a
brooding species, these results show that brooding species do not
necessarily need to be brooded in order to develop; they can be
raised successfully in vitro.
Laqueus californianus vancouverensis
One difficulty of studying the development L. c.
vancouverensis in the lab was its extremely low rate of fertilization,
perhaps 1% at best. Thus it was difficult to determine whether a
sample containing no cleaved eggs indicated that the fertilization was
unsuccessful or that the few eggs which did cleave were still in the
beaker rather than the sample. Nonetheless, examination of the
experimental conditions surrounding the two fertilizations known to
produce embryos gives some indication of what is necessary for a
successful fertilization.
Both of the successful fertilizations were carried out in water
that remained at 5 °C from egg soaking through early development.
Furthermore, all of the fertilizations believed to be unsuccessful were
carried out at temperatures either slightly higher or lower than 5 °C
(e.g. 7 °C, 10 °C, 2 °C). Therefore it seems that the fertilization of L. c.
vancouverensis is very temperature sensitive.
One result of carrying out fertilization in such cold water is that
development begins much more slowly for L. c. vancouverensis than
for other warmer water species (table 2). However, observations
indicate that L. c. vancouverensis "catches up" with its warmer water
