Nutting (1909), very little work has been published about this alcyonarian
(Abbott, 1987). Since so little is known about this species 1 focused mu
research on a basic understanding of its biologg. I established a pattern
for its distribution in Honterey Bag, described two distinct feeding
behaviors, described patterns of anthocodia retraction, and made
preliminary observations of its natural diet through a fecal analysis of
freshly collected individuols. These findings shed some light on how this
organism fits into the ecology of the Honterey Bay cangon wall.

Distribution in Honterey Bag
Tused video footage shot at points along the Honterey submarine
cangon wall to establish distributional patterns for Anthomastus ritteri
The footage was shot from a Sony Betacam DXC 3000 camera mounted on a
submersible Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) operated by the Honterey Bag
Aquorium Reseorch Institute (MBARI). In 1990, MBARI conducted cangon
wall dives at five locations, and these sites were surveged for
Anthamastus ritteridensities. Densities were established according to
the number of Anthomastusseen per unit time. The cangon wall locations
included the Point Joe, C4-C5, Cangon Wall Meander, North Wall, and Soquel
Cangon sites shown in Figure 1.
The video footage was sampled by counting the number of
Anthomastusseen during one-minute segments spaced over the tapes at
five-minute intervals. The depth, color, and habitat type were recorded
for each video segment surveged. The three different habitat types
recorded were exposed rock face, sediment cover, and the rocky slope
habitats. Densities for a particular geographic location ,depth range, and
habitat were established by dividing the total Anthomastusseen by
