droops toword the substrote ond its onthocodia retract partiallu. After
about 36 minutes of this partially retracted state, the anthocodia come
back out and the colong becomes erect once again. The colony recovers
fully from this partial retraction by 16 hours and 48 minutes into the
cycle. 18 hours and 54 minutes into the cycle, the colong begins a
complete retraction. The colong droops over again. When the anthocodia
are preparing to retract, the tentacles of all the polups curl away from the
oral disc. The anthocodia become flacid and begin to shrink. They continue
to shrink until only the tentacles are outside the lobe. Unlike the
retroction caused by mechanical stimulus, the anthocodia do not retract in
synchrong and there is no obvious pattern to the order of retractions. The
tentacles then curl into the lobe and the surface of the lobe squeezes shut
over the top of them 21 hours into the cycle. The stalk begins to shorten
at 21 hours and 54 minutes and pulls the lobe up next to the substrate over
the next hour. When up against the substrate, the lobe shrinks to about
two-thirds its normal size. The colony remains clomped up next to the
rock with anthocodia retracted for the remaining 5 hours and 6 minutes of
the cycle. These time values represent the average time over the two
observed cycles, but there was little variation between cycles. The
largest variation occurred in the timing of the portial retraction in the
middle of the cycle. In one cycle the partial retraction began at 13 hours
and 12 minutes and lasted 2 hours and 18 minutes, and that of the other
cycle started at 16 hours and 48 minutes and lasted 1 hour and 18 minutes.
The timing of the other events of the cycle were within 36 minutes of
each other between the two cycles.
