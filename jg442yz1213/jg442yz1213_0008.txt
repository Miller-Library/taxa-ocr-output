distension of the esophagus.
The largest live animals Anthomastushas been observed to ingest are
Artenionauplii. When live kelp mycids, Aconthonsis insculpta of about
1.0 cm length were put into a tank containing Anthomastus ritteritheu
were observed coming into contact with the tentacles but were easily able
to break free of the sticky tentacle before being drawn to the oral disc. On
an HBARI video tape token at the Congon Wall Heonder site on February
28, 1990, the golden-eye mycid was seen to come into contact with a
tentacle only to immediately break itself free of its sticky surface. Adult
brine shrimp, Artemig ore much wenker swimmers than the mycids, and
when one comes into contact with a tentacle, the tentacle is able to
maintain its hold and bring it to the oral disc and insert part of it into the
mouth. Once the esophogus becomes distended, however, the brine shrimp
is able to swim free of the polyp. Once the distension of the esophagus is
intiated by the brine shrimp being in the mouth, it continues down to the
base of the anthocodia and is followed by the peristaltic constriction
down the length of the anthocodia. The entire motion of the esophagus
occurs despite the fact that no food particle is being moved down towards
the lobe of the colong.
Anthocodia Retraction
Another interesting behavior of Anthomastus ritterris its ability to
retract its anthocodia into the colong's common fleshy lobe. This behavior
occurs both as a response to mechanical disturbances of the colony and as
a cyclical event from day to dag. A particularly sensitive area for
mechanical disturbance is the stalk of the colong. When the stalk is
disturbed by touch, the anthocodia of the entire colong begin the process
of retraction by becoming flacid and bending of the tentacles in towards
