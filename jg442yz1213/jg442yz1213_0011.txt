collected from on exposed rock foce habitat is summorized in Figure 5.
About 753 of the volume of each pellet was sand. The remaining 252 was
made up of organic material. Host of this organic material was brownish
flocculent detritus, and only a small portion could be identified as coming
from a particular organism.
The pellets coming from the one individual found in a sediment cover
habitat were of a different composition as shown in Figure 6. The
proportions of each pellet were reversed with 758 being organic material
and the remaining 258 being sand.
A comparison between what was found in the two pellet tupes in the
identifiable fraction is shown in Figure 7. Sponge spicules made up the
highest proportion by volume of the identifiable material in the first tupe
of pellet. Unidentifiable eggs made up the highest proportion in the second
type of fecal pellet collected from the one individual from a sediment
cover habitat.
Discussion:
Distribution
Anthomastus ritteriwere observed at all five sites surveged along
the cangon wall. All of the sites were located at depths ranging from
about 200m to 425m and were spread out around the bay along this band of
depth range.
The highest densities occur somewhere near the Cangon Wall Heander
site and falls off to the north and south. Sites with greater expanses of
exposed rock faces are likely to have higher concentrations than those
having mostly sediment cover habitats or rocky slopes. The densities
reached a maximum at about 350m and dropped off at deeper or shallower
sites. It is unclear why the species is more dense at a particular depth,
