The trro cycles of retroction and exponsion of polups in undisturbed
specimens were somewhat longer than a day in length. During the daytime
dives of the HBARI ROV, about 40 percent of the Anthomastusseen have
portially or completely retracted anthocodia. During the two cycles
observed in the lab, about 39 percent of the time was spent with
anthocodia partially or completely retracted. The closeness of these two
numbers suggests two things. The cycles observed in the lab are good
approximations of what occurs in the natural environment. At any given
time, the different Anthomastuscolonies in their natural environment are
ot different relative points along their individual cycles. This further
suggests, along with the measured length of the cycle of 27 hours, that the
cycles are not dependent on the daily cycle of night and dag. It would be
interesting to discover what the factors are which influence this cycle of
retraction and extension.
Fecal Analysis
The results of the fecal analysis suggest that Anthaastus ritteri
ingest different proportions of detritus and sand depending on habitat
tupe. The high proportion of sand mag indicate a greater exposure to
grains on rock faces either from sand falling from above or stronger
currents suspending coarser material. It is impossible to draw ang valid
comparisons about the diet of this species on different substrates since
examined the fecal pellets of only one specimen collected from a sediment
cover habitat. However, it is interesting that the one individual collected
from this habitat tupe had a striking difference in the composition of its
fecal pellets, and it seems reasonable that the proportions of sand and
detritus ingested would depend upon the immediate surroundings of the
individual.
