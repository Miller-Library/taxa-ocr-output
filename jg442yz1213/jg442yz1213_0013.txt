individuals is also a perplexing question. It is possible that theu
represent genetically different morphs with different ranges, but this is
not clear because there is a gradual gradation in color from white to pink
to red. It is possible that the color variation has something to do with
development and diet or other environmental factors. If it is intraspecific
genetic variation, the distribution could be attributed to a gradation of
selective pressures or larval settlement from different parental
populations from north to south.
These findings should be considered only as preliminary distributional
results. The sample sizes are quite variable by depth and location. The
densities by habitat type most likely depend heavily on the availability of
a suitable attachment site, but other considerations such as the level of
disturbance from deep currents are also likely to plag a significant role.
Another difficulty in analyzing these results arises from the fact that the
ROY does not cruise at a constant rate over the cangon wall surface and it
has a variable size to its field of view due to its proximity to the wall and
the setting of its zoom lens. These considerations were hopefullu
minimized by a large sampling. The amount of time sompled varied from
thirty-seven minutes at the Cangon Wall Heander site to one hour and
forty-seven minutes at the North Wall site. The sampling problems at
certain depths have already been discussed. The time was divided
relatively evenly among habitat tupes with a low of one hour and
thirty-five minutes spent on rocky slope and a high of two hours and
twenty-one minutes on exposed rock faces.
The depth range of all Anthomastus ritteri seen by the ROV was found
in the HBARI database to be 210 m to 430 m, but the data is patchy since
the ROV rarely goes below 400 m and also due to technical problems in
recording depth on some dives. In the original collections of the species
