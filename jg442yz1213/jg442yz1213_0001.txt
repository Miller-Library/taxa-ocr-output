and on exposed rock faces. Khite individuals are more common towards
the south while pink and red ones are the only ones seen at the
northernmost locations. Two distinct feeding behaviors are used bu the
species depending on whether it is ingesting large or small particles.
Anthocodia retract both in response to mechanical stimuli and in an
endogenous cyclical pattern of 27 hours length. Fecal analysis suggests
that they are ingesting mainly sand particles and detritus.
Introduction:
Anthomastus ritteriis a soft coral found along the cangon wall of
Honterey Bag. It is a polymorphic colonial organism having a variable
number of two polyp types. Autozooids are the large feeding polups while
the siphonozooids appear as ting bumps which cover the surface of the
lobe and pump water through the colong (Abbott, 1987). Their
gastrovascular cavities extend through a common fleshg lobe down to the
base of a stalk. Within the lobe is a solenial network which interconnects
the gastrovascular tubes of each polup providing the colong with a common
nutrient pool. The portion of the autozooid which projects from the lobe
of the colong is called the anthocodia (Hyman, 1940). The anthocodia are
copable of retracting completely into the fleshy lobe.
