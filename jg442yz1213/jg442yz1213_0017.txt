The significonce of sand and detritus in the fecal pellets is that this
provides evidence that Anthonastus ritterimay be getting nutrients from
bacteria and the microfauna found associated with sand and detrital
particles as well as the detritus itself. Further circumstantial evidence
that they are purposely ingesting detritus as a source of nutrients is seen
in the fact that there is a zonation along the stalk of Anthomastus
colonies. Khile the bottom of the stalk is covered with a thin, visible
lager of brownish detritus, the upper part is cleon and white. The division
between these two zones is sharp and it lies on the stalk at a position as
far down the stalk as the polyps can reach. This suggests that the polups
dre feeding on the detritus which settles on their stalk and possiblu onu
microorganisms which grow there. From the fecal analysis it appears that
organic detritus and sand make up the largest part of the diet of
Anthomestus ritteri, while small crustaceans and poluchaetes are the
occasional larger food particles which come along. The other identifiable
constituents of the fecal pellets are probably being taken in with the sand
and detritus. By ingesting sand and detritus as a source of nutrients.
Anthomestus ritteriis exploiting virtually unlimited resources on the
cangon wall of Honterey Bau.
