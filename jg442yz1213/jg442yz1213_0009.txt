the oral disc and away from the lobe. This process can be reversible with
the tentacles bending back down and becoming capable of feedinq, but with
strunger stimulation the anthocodia will be completely retracted. When
the retraction occurs in response to mechaincal disturbance, all the
anthocodia respond at the same time immediately after the disturbance.
If an individual anthocodia is disturbed, the reaction is local
involving only that polyp and more likely to be reversible. During the
process of retraction, water is expelled from the anthocodia causing them
to shrink. The anthocodia continue to shrink down until they are entirelu
inside the lobe with only the tentocles sticking out. The tentacles are
then brought inside the lobe with their tips enterring last and the surface
of the lobe tightens around the space occupied by the retracted polup
leaving only a pit in the surface of the lobe.
The cyclical retraction of polyps was observed in one individual using
time lapse photography over the course of three days. Two cycles were
observed taking 27 hours each storting with the anthocodia retracted and
the lobe pulled down next to the substrate just before the colong begins to
come out. The first sign of the colony preparinq to come out is the
expansion and extension of the stalk which lifts the lobe away from the
substrate. This takes aproximately 36 minutes. The first anthocodia
begins coming out at about 30 minutes, just prior to the stalk being
completely extended. The anthocodia do not all come out at the same time,
and there is no obvious order which they follow. When theg come out, the
tentacles of the polups are buried in their mouths and they slide out and
curl away from the oral disc as the polyp expands. By the time 1 hour and
40 minutes have passed, the anthocodia are completely extended and in
their feeding posture. They remain fully extended until a total of 15 hours
have passed from the beginning of the cycle. At this point the colong
