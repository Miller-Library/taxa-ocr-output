Feeding Behavior
Anthansstus ritterihas two distinct feeding patterns, one for larger
prey items and the other for smaller particles. In both patterns,
autozooids are sessile predators, waiting for particles to come into
contact with outstreched tentacles. When all the anthocodia are fullu
extended, the tentacles of the polyps stretch out in a plane around the oral
disc, and combine to form a web-like network arranged in a sphere around
the fleshy body of the colong. The tentacles of adjacent polyps do not
overlap but come into close proximity at their tips. When a food particle
touches a part of this network, the feeding behavior is intiated. The
nematocysts on the tentacles are of the atrichous isorhiza tupe which
contain no toxins but function by causing the food particle to stick to the
tentacle (Huscatine and Lenhoff, 1974). The tentacle which captures the
food is termed the primary tentacle". From this point, the behavior can
follow one of two basic routes.
The first pattern is observed when the polup ingests dead krill of
about 1.0 to 1.5 centimeters in length. This was the larger food object for
laboratory observations. The primary tentacle with the food item attached
curls in bringing the particle to the oral disc. It works independently
bringing the item to the oral disc with no assistance from the other
tentacles of the polyp. Once the primary tentacle has curled into the
middle, the other tentacles bend up at their bases to form a fence of
tentacles around the oral disc. The tentacles squeeze together over the
food particle to form a cage completely around the piece of food. The
polup then begins to bend over in the direction of the pull of gravity The
polup swells to about 1.6 times its normal diameter and the esophagus is
seen to distend initially at its distal end to about 2.5 times its normal
