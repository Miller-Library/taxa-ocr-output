went through 2 cycles of exponsion and retraction.
Fecal Pellet Analysis
In order to study the natural diet of Antbomastus ritteri,1 analized
fecal pellets from freshly collected individuals. The Anthamastus
specimens were collected with the HBARI ROV at the northern extreme of
the C4-C5 site. One individual from a sediment cover habitat was
collected on Hay 14 and eight others from an exposed rock habitat were
collected on Hay 23, 1990. The specimens were transported to the
Honterey Bay Aquarium where they were put into clean tanks. Fecal
pellets were collected over the course of the two days following
collection. A total of 19 pellets were collected from the 8 individuals
coming from the exposed rock habitat, and 8 were collected from the one
Anthomostus found on sediment cover. The pellets were transferred with
forceps to vials containing 808 ethanol.
The fecal pellets were dissected with needles and the fragments
mounted on glass slides for examination under a compound microscope.
Eoch slide contained one pellet with a total volume of about 0.03 cme.
systematically worked my way across each slide in lines so as to cover all
parts of the sample. I estimated the relative volumes of the particle
tupes I saw. The estimate was made using an arbitrary standard unit of
volume which was the average volume of the sand grains found in the
pellets, or about 8.0 x10° cm°. Sand and other material in the pellets
vere counted according to this unit.
