habitat type, or geographical location and these parameters are bu no
means inseparable. For example, it may be that they are most dense at
350m because this happens to be where the habitat is right for them at the
Canyon Wall Heender site. There are probably several other variables to
consider which  did not include in my research.
Other aspects of their benthic habitat, begond substrate tupe, must
be identified and studied in order to get a better idea of why they mau
prefer one habitat over another. Even substrate tupe was difficult to
characterize in the case of sediment cover because it is difficult to know
whether the sediment is in a thin lager over a hard rock surface or if it is
actually a thick sediment slope. It is assumed that the stalk of the
Anthonestusmust be attached to a rock base in order to keep the colonu
upright. Their concentration on a sediment slope would therefore be
limited by the number of small rocks found near the surface of the
sediment. The rock face substrate may be preferred to the rocky slope
because the entire surface has access to nutrient sources suspended in the
water column while on a rocky slope there are numerous crevices and pits
and less surface area which has a free access to the water column.
Their distribution by depth is also difficult to interpret especially
since only 20 minutes of video footage was surveged at depths greater
than 400 m as shown in Figure 3. The drop off in concentration at this end
may be less drastic than indicated in the figure. The actual depth is
probably less critical than other factors influencing distribution.
Pressure does not seem to play a significant role because one individual
which was collected and kept alive for three months at the Honterey Bau
Aquarium has been observed to grow and develope new polyps at ambient
pressure
