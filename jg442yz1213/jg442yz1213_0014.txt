individuals were collected off Point Pinos north of the the Point Joe site
ot depths ranging from 518 m to 587 m. During these original collections
Atterwere also collected off the coast of Los Angeles and Santa
Barbaro at depths ranging from 393 m to 796 m neer Santa Barbara Island
and San Nicholas Island and from 920 m to 1236 m near Gull Island. One
species of Anthomestus, A. gronulesus (Kükenthal, 1910), which has been
found in both Japanese and South African waters has a shallower depth
range of 20 m to 200 m (Utinomi, 1960). A fisherjhas been found near
Hawaii from 200 m to 1027 m (Bayer, 1952), and A steenstrupihas been
found neor Jopon from 222 m to 1027 m (Nutting, 1900). A jopoicus
(Nutting, 1913) is found in Japanese waters and A grandiflorus (Verrill,
1883) is found in the North Atlantic in waters near Greenland, Iceland, and
Norwag south to the Caribbean Sea. Their depth ranges are 484 m to 989 m
and 136 m to 2773 m respectively (Nutting, 1913 and Jungersen, 1927).
The depth range of A tteriin Honterey Bag apparently extends shallower
thon once thought giving it an overall known depth range of 210 m to 1236
m. This range is similer, though somewhat deeper than A fisherjand A
steenstrupi
Feeding Behavior
The motility of the esophagus appears to be a programmed response
intiated by a large food item being inserted into the mouth by a tentacle.
Unce initiated it proceeds to completion whether or not the food particle
is ingested or not. Since the food particle passes down the expanded
esophagus to the base of the anthocodia before the peristaltic constriction
occurs at the distal end, cilie are probably responsible for the particle’s
movement. The gastrodermal lining of the esophagus in most alcyonaria is
flagellated (Hyman, 1940). The expanded esophagus may just give the food
