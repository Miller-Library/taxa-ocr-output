porticle spoce to move and the peristaltic motion may serve to push doyn
angthing which mag have become lodged in the tube and to squeeze the food
particle down past the base of the anthocodia.
It is significont thot the polyp does not have to undergo a swelling
and bending over for the ingestion of small food particles. When a polup is
ingesting large food particles, it is not able to retract into the fleshy lobe
of the colong. This meons that the polyp is more susceptible to damage
from any threat which may have caused the polyps to retract. It is
important that the polyp need not expend as much energy or expose itself
to the possibility of damage when ingesting small food particles.
Anthocodia Retraction
Retraction in response to mechanical disturbances to the
Anthomastus rittericolony appears to be a defensive response. It is not
clear what the species must defend against in its natural environment. A
nudibronch, Tritonie diemedig, which is often seen at sites having
numerous Anthomastus ritterihas been identified as a possible predator.
This nudibranch is knovn to feed on sea pens in shallower waters and mau
be a predator of alcyonarians in general. Since the colony retracts its
polyps and squeezes its stalk down to cover it with the colong's lobe,
there mag be something that feeds on the polyps or the stalk but is
uninterested in eating the material which makes up the lobe. Also, bu
clamping down next to the rock and squeezing out any excess water, the
colony is less susceptible to being battered around by currents or the
incidental contact of other animals. In two of the seventeen Anthamastus
collected, catshark egg cases were wrapped tightly around the stalks.
There may be other interactions from different species which have the
potential to damage a colong.
