A total of eleven dives were surveged. They included two dives at
Point Joe on April 19,1989 and January 10, 1990; four dives at C4-C5 on
Harch 26, Hay 1, Hay 7, and Hay 14, 1990; one dive at Cangon Wall Heander

Feeding Behavior
Anthonastus individuals were collected with the MBARI ROV and kept
at 6Â°C in tanks at the Honterey Bag Aquarium. Feeding behavior was
studied using live Artemignauplii and dead krill. Live kelp mucids,
Aconthomysis insculple, and brine shrimp, Artemig, were also tried, but
Anthonestusspecimens were unable to capture and ingest these larger,
live animals. Nauplii were squirted gently near the Antbomostus
tentacles using a turkey baster. Care was taken not to disturb the polups
with too forceful a squirt from the turkey baster while at the same time
ensuring the nauplii would run into the polyp tentacles. The dead krill was
placed on a tentacle using forceps. The esophagus of the Anthamestusis
clearly visible as a red tube running through the transparent outer tissue
layers along the length of the anthocodia. The movement of krill down the
esophagus can be observed because the black eges of krill are visible
through the red tissue layer lining the esophagus.
Anthocodia Retraction
The retraction of anthocodia was observed using the individuals
collected by the MBARI ROV and stored at the Hontereg Bay Aquarium. A
plastic probe was used for stimulation by touching them on their stalk and
polups. Their endogenous cyclical retractions were recorded with a Song
VHS video camera on a tripod and attached it to a VeR with a time
