thermal stress. A. elegantissima utilizes only constitutive Hsp 70 isoforms to
allow it to adapt to the range of environmental temperatures found in its
environment. In other words, induction of Hsps is not strongly correlated to
ecologically relevant, thermal stress. Therefore, in response to thermal stresses
near its upper, natural growth range, it is likely that the anemone employs other
sorts of physiological mechanisms for tolerance and protection.
The results of this study raise questions that must be answered before
further investigation of environmental stressors, their induction of heat shock
proteins, and the relevance of the stress protein response to in situ populations
of A. elegantissima can be directed and fruitful. The idea of a threshold for Hsp
induction introduced above is one that is instructive for this path of
investigation. First, the temperature threshold for the induction of various heat
shock proteins must be found. Second, the duration of the thermal stress
required to induce the Hsps must be described. Subsequently, once the
laboratory answers to these first two questions are provided, extensive fieldwork
must be done to determine the relevance of the acquired knowledge to what is
actually occurring in the intertidal zone.
Conclusion
Few studies have attempted to relate the physiological response of whole
organisms to underlying biochemical changes that result from environmental
insults such as elevated temperature. I have demonstrated a correlation
between such biochemical changes and the heat-induced loss of endosymbionts
in Anthopleura elegantissima. Algal expulsion due to a 48 h, 31 °C thermal
stress was complete within two weeks. Induction of a 70kD Hsp 70 was also seen
in anemones subjected to this heat shock. Thermal stress at a more
