Grove, CA. Symbiotic animals were collected from rocks in full sunlight,
whereas naturally-occurring aposymbiotic animals were collected from
underneath the adjacent Monterey Bay Aquarium. Animals were maintained
in outdoor, running seawater tanks (referred to as control tanks, subsequently)
set to 13 °C, beneath screened sunlight for at least one week, but not more than
one month, prior to experimentation.
Heat stress experimental procedure
Specimens, which had been settling into glass dishes during the
acclimatory period, were transported within their dishes from the control tanks
directly to a twelve liter aquarium containing seawater preheated to 24 °C or 31
C. The tanks designated for thermal shock were situated indoors, beneath low
light levels, and were equipped with air stones and a cover to prevent
hypersaline conditions (periodically during the heat shocks, salinity
measurements were taken with a American Optics portable refractometer to
insure that normal salinity levels (32 %) were maintained). Directly after
exposure to 48 h of thermal stress, animals were returned to the control tanks
for recovery.
Determination of algal densities
During the experimental regime described above, clips were taken from
the anemone’s columns at intervals. Animals were removed from the tank,
and a small piece of column was excised with a razor blade whilst the anemone
remained attached to the glass bowl. Also, anemone extracts used for
immunoblots were prepared from animals distinct from those that were clipped
for algal numbers. The clips were then homogenized in filtered seawater (FSW)
