The second mAb used, N27, is also specific for the Hsp 70 family of
proteins; it was employed to complement the 3A3 mAb as it recognizes à distinct
epitope. The six time points, plus control anemone, that were sampled and
subsequently probed with the 3A3 mAb were also employed in the N27
immunoblots. Immunoblots of 31 °C heat stressed anemones probed with the
N27 anti-Hsp 70 mAb showed two proteins, one at 70kD, the other at 30kD, in
animals from all time points during and after heat stress (Fig. 4), but not in the
control anemone lane where only the 30kD protein appeared (Fig. 4, lane 4).
Densitometric analysis did not offer robust conclusions regarding the changes in
the 70kD protein intensity over the time course (data not shown). In contrast to
the induction of the 70kD protein in response to heat stress at 31 °C, anemones
subjected to 24 °C heat stress showed no induction of a 70kD protein (Fig. 5).
However, a protein at 30kD was present in all animals including the control.
Immunoblots of 31 °C heat stressed aposymbiotic A. elegantissima probed with
3A3 and N27 anti-Hsp 70 mAb
To determine the effect of the presence of algae on the occurrence of the
Hsp 70 family of proteins in response to elevated temperature, proteins from à
heat stressed aposymbiotic A. elegantissima were probed with the 343 and N27
mAbs. The aposymbiotic anemone was exposed to a 31 °C heat stress for 48h.
and its protein was isolated immediately. Lanes 2 and 3, in both Figs. 6 and 7,
are the control aposymbiotic anemone and the heat stressed aposymbiotic
anemone, respectively. Results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 coincide with the results
of the 31 °C heat stressed symbiotic anemones (Figs. 2 and 4). A 70KD protein
that cross-reacts with the N27 anti-Hsp 70 mAb in the 48 h heat stressed
aposymbiotic A. elegantissima (Fig. 7, lane 3) is at the same molecular weight as
