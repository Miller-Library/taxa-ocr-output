post-stress, although, no samples were taken between R4d and R13d time points.
No algal density samples was taken on the 24 °C heat stressed anemones.
Although the anemones appeared mildly lighter in color, no marked bleaching
effect was noted after two weeks of observation.

In order to determine the effect of hyperthermal stress on the presence of
Hsp 70 proteins, protein samples from heat stressed A. elegantissima were
probed with the 3A3 mAb that cross reacts with the Hsp 70 family of proteins.
Samples of heat stressed anemones were taken at six time points: S6, S24, S48
R24, R5d, and RlOd. What is referred to as the control anemone in all western
blots (Figs. 2-7) is an unstressed A. clegantissima that was maintained in the
control tanks. In the far left lane(s) of all blots (Figs. 2-7) is what is referred to as
the positive control: purified Hsp 70 from bovine brain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
with a molecular weight of 70kD. A single protein appearing at 70kD that cross-
reacts with the 343 mAb occurs with equal intensity at all time points, including
control anemone, and at both elevated temperatures (Figs. 2 and 3; 31 % and 24
C respectively). The apparent molecular weight of this protein is exactly equal
to that of the positive control Hsp 70 protein described above. Densitometric
scans of the immunoblots shown in Figs. 2 and 3 confirm that the protein is of
70kD in apparent molecular weight and that there is no significant variation in
intensity over the time course (data not included)
