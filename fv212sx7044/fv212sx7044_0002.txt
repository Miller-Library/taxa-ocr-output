Identification and temporal correlation of physiological and biochemical
responses to elevated temperature stress in cnidarians is novel and instructive
for further study of the stress response in invertebrates.
Introduction
Cnidarian-alga symbioses have been the subject of numerous studies of
the impact of environmental stressors such as high UV light levels, salinity
fluctuations, heavy metals, and variations in water temperature. In response to
extreme environmental insults, a breakdown of the symbiotic relationship can
occur in which the host expels the symbiont in large quantities (Hoegh¬
Guldberg, 1989; Glynn, 1990; Lesser et al., 1990; Muscatine et al. 1991). This
response, termed ’bleaching,“ has been studied extensively in tropical coral and
anemone symbioses, however, little work has been done on animals that
inhabit temperate environments.
The temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt)
maintains an endosymbiotic association with the photosynthetic dinoflagellate
Symbiodinium californium (McNally et al., 1994). It should be noted, however,
that aposymbiotic A. elegantissima, anemones lacking algal symbionts, are
known to occur naturally and to inhabit locations with low or no solar radiation
(Buchsbaum, 1968). A. elegantissima, which is the most abundant sea anemone
found along the North American Pacific coast (Hand, 1955), is an intertidal
animal that is subjected to largely unpredictable variations in temperature, pH,
salinity, and water loss (Fitt et al., 1982; Taylor and Littler, 1982). The organismal
stress response of A. elegantissima and its congener A. xanthogrammica have
been elucidated by Buchsbaum (1968), Engebretson and Martin (1994), and
O'Brien and Wyttenbach (1980). The present investigation attempts to draw
