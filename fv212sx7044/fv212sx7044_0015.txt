the 70kD Hsp 70 as the symbiotic anemone. Naturally occurring symbiotic and
aposymbiotic A. elegantissima may be genetically identical, i.e. from the same
clone (Buchsbaum, 1968), but differ phenotypically with regard to presence of the
symbiotic algae. In addition, phenotypic differences in terms of biochemical
expression between symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. elegantissima have been
ascribed to the presence of algae in experiments performed by Weis and Levine
(in print, 1995). Thus, the lack of the 30kD protein in the stressed and unstressed
aposymbiotic A. elegantissima is not inconceivable. However, labeling the
protein a symbiosis-specific, constitutive LMW Hsp 70 may be premature.
Undoubtedly, further experiments must be performed to understand the
differential expression of the 30kD and 70kD Hsp 70 within the species, and how
it relates to the proteins' functions in the two animals.
The [3°8lmethionine experiment did not corroborate the induction of the
70kD protein in the 31 °C heat stressed anemone experiments. The comparison
of newly synthesized (de novo) proteins in control and heat stressed anemones
reveals qualitative differences in proteins with high turnover rates, but low
relative abundance. It may be enlightening to try and infer ug quantities of the
70kD protein from the western blots to characterize its overall abundance. Ir
Figs. 2 and 3, lug of purified Hsp 70 was loaded in lane 3. All proteins probed
with the 3A3 mAb are of less intensity. Therefore, if we assume that all lanes
contain at most 0.75ug of the 70kD protein, and it is known that 15ug of total
protein was loaded in each lane, its abundance would be less than 5% of total
protein loaded. Assuming that the 3A3 mAb binds with equal affinity to the
bovine brain isolated Hsp 70 positive control and the constitutive and inducible
forms of the 70kD protein observed, the 70kD protein is not highly abundant in
proportion to the total ugs of protein loaded. This may be an explanation for the
