conclusions regarding not only the physiological stress response of A.
elegantissima to elevated temperature, as discussed in Buchsbaum (1968), and
O'Brien and Wyttenbach (1980), but also the underlying biochemical changes.
Papers on another temperate anemone, Anemonia viridis, also document
bleaching and biochemical changes in response to elevated temperature stress
(Miller et al., 1992; Sharp et al., 1994). In particular, changes in soluble proteins
have been discussed within the context of heat shock proteins (Hsp) and the
heat shock response (for reviews see Lindquist, 1986; Craig and Lindquist, 1988;
Sanders, 1993)
In the present study, the response of A. elegantissima to thermal stress is
characterized on the level of the organism in terms of algal expulsion and at the
biochemical level in terms of qualitative and quantitative changes in soluble
protein expression. The constitutive and inducible isoforms of a 70kD Hsp 70
protein as well as a low molecular weight 30kD Hsp 70 cross-reactive protein are
the focus of the quantitative assays. The identification of constitutive and
inducible Hsp 70 isoforms at two different elevated temperatures, 31 Â°C and 24
raises interesting questions regarding the stress response and upper thermal
limits of organisms in light of extensive discussion in the literature of the role
of Hsps in the phenomenon of thermotolerance and environmental adaptation
(Lindquist, 1986; Bosch et al., 1988; Sanders et al., 1991; Sanders, 1993; Sharp et al.
1994)
