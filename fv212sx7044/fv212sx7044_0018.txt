physiologically relevant temperature, 24 Â°C, did not result in induction of the
70kD Hsp 70, nor was marked bleaching observed. Also, a 30kD Hsp 70 was
expressed constitutively in both groups of thermally stressed anemones.
These findings lead to the conclusion that constitutive expression of a 70kD and
30kD Hsp 70, in concert with other physiological mechanisms, function to
confer tolerance to environmental extremes of temperature.

I am grateful to Dr. R. Paul Levine and Dr. Virginia M. Weis for their
unwavering enthusiasm and dedication to this project. The offering of their
knowledge, insight, and support has been deeply appreciated. I would also like
to extend thanks and good feelings to my labmates, Archana Dhawan, Ajna
Pisani, Nicole Boudreaux, and Sunny Sanders and Davey. My experience at
Hopkins will remain with me, in my pleasant thoughts, for years to come.
