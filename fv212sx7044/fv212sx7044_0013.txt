surface because of the slightly elevated temperatures in tide pools. However, it
seems likely that the heat shock response in A. elegantissima could only be
elicited by thermal stress in concert with additional environmental stressors
such as high UV light levels, salinity fluctuation and dessication.
The anti-murine monoclonal antibody 3A3 has been used more
extensively in experimental investigations than the N27 mAb. It recognizes an
epitope located between amino acids 504-617 of human Hsp 70, a region shown
to be involved in stress-induced nucleolar localization (Sanders, 1994; Sharp et
al., 1994; Hayes and King, 1995; Affinity Bioreagents data sheets). The antibody
reacts with several antigens of the Hsp 70 family, including the inducible form,
Hsp 72, and the constitutive form, Hsp 73. Sanders (1994) found the 3A3 mAb to
be the most broadly cross-reactive, across species, among four anti-Hsp 70 mAbs
tested-N27 included. The Ab recognized distinct constitutive and inducible
forms of Hsp 70 proteins at 70kD in equal numbers of species. In the present
study the Ab recognized the constitutive form of the 70kD protein in all
animals, stressed and unstressed, at both thermal stress temperatures. The
epitope of the protein that the mAb recognizes must be responsible for a
consequential function in thermally stressed animals as it is highly conserved
across phyla.
The low molecular weight (LMW) proteins are more species-specific than
the other major stress protein families and less highly conserved (Craig, 1985;
Lindquist, 1986; Sanders, 1993). This family of proteins is induced under adverse
environmental conditions and has long been implicated in thermotolerance
(for review see Sanders, 1993). In fact, LMW stress proteins have been shown to
accumulate in desert succulents acclimatized to high temperatures (Kee and
Noble, 1986). The induction of four LMW proteins, at 28, 29, 30 and 31kD, in
response to elevated temperature shock in temperate anemones has been
