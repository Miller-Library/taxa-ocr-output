Sampling times and notation used
The following notation for sampling times will be used in this paper: S
denotes time during the 48 hour stress period and R denotes time after the 48 h
stress, in the recovery period. For example, the first sampling point for 1-D SDS
PAGE is S6, which signifies a time point six hours into the stress period; the
final time point is R15d, or 15 days into the recovery period, which is actually 17
days after initiation of the experiment. As seen in this example, if the notation
contains a "d," the number indicates days; in all other notation, hours are
implied.
Results
Kinetics of algae loss in response to elevated temperature
Visual inspection of the 31 째C heat stressed anemones did not reveal
remarkable discoloration during the 48 h trial, but two and three days into the
recovery period the oral disks of anemones appeared markedly lighter. Time
points at which the anemones were sampled were as follows: prior to heat
stress (S0), at the end of heat stress (S48), 48 h into the recovery period (R48),
four days into the recovery period (R4d) and 13 days into the recovery period
(R13d). The 48 h thermal stress at 31 째C resulted in the loss of more than 50 % of
algae during the thermal stress (Fig. 1). The number of algal cells per mg
animal protein at SO was 5.51 x 10째, however, at S48, when the animals were
being replaced to control conditions, that number dropped to 2.32 x 10째. The
subsequent two sample points revealed a less precipitous decline in the number
of algae, however, at 13 days post-shock no algae were seen on slides prepared
from the column clips. Anemones appeared completely bleached by one week
