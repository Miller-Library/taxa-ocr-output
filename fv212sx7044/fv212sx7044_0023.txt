Figure 1. Algal loss from A. clegantissima vs. time in response to 31 %
temperature stress. Samples taken from animals at the following times: SO, S48,
R48, R4d, R13d. Stress period is marked on abscissa with a dark band. Each point
= mean + SE, (n=3).
Figure 2. Immunoblot using 3A3 anti-Hsp 70 mAb of A. elegantissima soluble
protein extracts during and after 31 °C temperature stress. Lanes 1-3 are a
dilution series of purified bovine brain Hsp 70, containing 0.lug, O.3ug, and
0.9ug respectively. Fifteen (15) ug of sample protein derived from animals was
loaded in lanes 4-10. Lane 4 is the control anemone, no heat stress. Lanes 5-10
contain protein from thermally stressed anemones: lane 5 anemone removed
from stress at 6 hours; lane 6 anemone removed from stress at 24 hours; lane 7
anemone removed from stress at 48 hours; lane 8 anemone removed from
control tank after 24 hours of recovery from thermal stress; lane 9 anemone
removed after 5 days of recovery; lane 10 anemone removed after 10 days of
recovery.
Figure 3. Immunoblot using 343 anti-Hsp 70 mAb of A. elegantissima soluble
protein extracts during and after 24 °C temperature stress. Lane assignments are
same as Fig. 2. Same amounts of animal protein and purified Hsp 70 loaded as
Fig. 2. Sample time points for lanes 5-10 are same as Fig. 2.
Figure 4. Immunoblot using N27 anti-Hsp 70 mAb of A. elegantissima soluble
protein extracts during and after 31 °C temperature stress. Lane assignments are
