exposed to 250 umoles quanta : m’2 . s+ of light, which is above the saturation
point for photosynthesis in isolated algae from A. elegantissima (Muller-Parker,
pers. comm.), for the duration of the experiment. Fifty uCi of L-828lmethionine
(Amersham, Arlington, III.) were added to each vessel after the 45 min pre¬
incubation, and the animals were labeled for 4 h. Each animal was then rinsed
in three successive 10 ml volumes of 0.2 M L-methionine in 40 mM Tris, pH 7.4.
Animals were then frozen in liquid N2 and placed at -20 °C until further
processing. Äfter homogenization and protein isolation were carried out as
described above, scintillation counts were determined by a Packard 2200CA
liquid scintillation counter and 150,000 cpm of animal proteins were set aside for
gel electrophoresis.
Gel electrophoresis
A. elegantissima proteins (15ug) were separated by one-dimensional
sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1-D SDS-PAGE) on
12.5% minigels (8x7 cm) of Imm thickness (methods modified from Laemmli,
1970). Pre-stained molecular weight standards (Bio-rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA) were loaded onto gels for the determination of the apparent molecular
weights of the proteins. Gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue
Gels of 3581-labeled proteins were left unstained, fixed in 40% methanol, 10%
acetic acid for 30 minutes and then enhanced with Resolution
chemiluminescence autoradiography enhancer (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following enhancement, gels
were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at -70 °C.
