elegantissima soluble protein extracts after 31 °C temperature stress. Fifteen (15)
ug of anemone protein was loaded in lanes 2 and 3. Purified Hsp 70 (0.25 ug)
loaded in lane 1. Control aposymbiotic anemone, lane 2. Thermally stressed
aposymbiotic anemone, S48, in lane 3.

Figure 8. Autoradiograph of L[82S)-methionine-labeled soluble protein profiles
derived from 31 °C temperature stressed A. elegantissima. Lane 1 contains pre¬
stained molecular weight markers. Equal counts (150,000 cpm) were loaded in
lanes 2-7. Lanes 2, 4 and 6 contain protein derived from control anemones.
Thermally stressed anemones were incubated at the following times: lane 3 =
S24; lane 5 = R24; lane 7 = R5d. Arrows point to proteins that show marked
changes in intensity along the time course.
