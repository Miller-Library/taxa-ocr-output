Protein transfer from unstained gels to nitrocellulose membranes was
performed according to the procedure described by Burnette (1981) with slight
modifications. Proteins were transferred in a Hoefer TE22 transfer apparatus
overnight at 12 ?C at a constant current (25mA) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine,
20% methanol, 0.01% SDS buffer, pH 8.3 (modified from Towbin et al., 1979).
After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were removed from the gel and
blocked in TBS/Milk/Tween (60ml 5X TBS, 15g Carnation nonfat dry milk,
0.3ml Tween20) for at least on hour at 37 Â°C. Blots were then probed with either
anti-murine Hsp70 343 monoclonal antibody (received from Dr. Sean Murphy,
Northwestern Univ., Illinois) in a 1:10000 dilution of TBS/Milk/Tween or anti-
murine Hsp70 N27F3-4 (N27) monoclonal antibody (StressGen, Victoria, B.C.,
Canada) in a 1:1000 dilution of TBS/Milk/Tween. Primary antibodies were
Incubated overnight in seal-a-meal bags on a slow rotary shaker at 12 %C. Blots
were then washed successively with 1X TBS, TBS/Tween (1X TBS, 0.5% Tween).
and IX TBS for 10 minutes each (30 minutes total). Secondary antibody probing
occured with goat anti-murine IgG (whole molecule) horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) diluted 1:1000 in 1X TBS for 1 h with rapid
shaking. Blots were rinsed as above for 30 min and subsequently incubated in
Renaissance western blot Enhanced Chemiluminescense (ECL) reagents
(DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) for 1 minute and imaged on Kodak XAR-5 film.
Densitometric analysis
X-ray films of immunoblots were scanned by transmittance using a
Pharmacia ImageMaster densitometer and analyzed with Pharmacia
Image Master Software (Version 1.0) according to prescribed methods.
