Abstract
The symbiotic sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima has been shown
to exhibit a salient physiological response to elevated thermal stress that entails
the expulsion of its endosymbiotic algae, Symbiodinium californium. A.
elegantissima clones were subjected to a 48 h thermal stress at 24 °C and 31 °C.
The kinetics of the bleaching event was quantified in the latter treatment such
that more than 50% (2.32 x 10° / 5.51 x 10°; units in number of alga cells/mg
animal protein) of the algae were expelled at the end of the 48 h, and complete
loss of algae was noted 13 days after the stress. Two anti-murine Hsp 70
monoclonal antibodies, 3A3 and N27F3-4 (N27), were utilized to probe for
constitutive and inducible Hsp 70 family proteins by immunoblotting using
anemone samples taken from both elevated temperature groups at six time
points during and after the thermal stress. The 3A3 mAb recognized a
constitutive 70kD protein in stressed and unstressed anemones at both the 24 °C
and 31 °C treatments. In the 31 °C treatment, the N27 mAb revealed rapid
induction (seen at six hours) of a 70kD protein in all thermally stressed
anemones, but not in the unstressed anemone. Also, the N27 mAb revealed a
low molecular weight 30kD cross-reactive protein present in both stressed and
unstressed anemones. In the 24 °C elevated temperature group, the N27 mAb
revealed no sign of the 70kD protein at all sample times, nor was it present in
the unstressed anemone. However, the constitutive 30kD protein was present
in all samples including the unstressed anemone. Qualitative changes in
soluble proteins in response to both treatments were visualized by
398 methionine labeling during and after thermal stress. An aposymbiotic
anemone subjected to a 48 h, 31 °C heat stress showed induction of the 70kD
protein; constitutive 70kD protein was also seen with the 3A3 mAb.
