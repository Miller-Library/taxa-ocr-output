documented by Miller et al. (1992) and Sharp et al. (1994). Using 1-D SDS-PAGE,
Miller et al. (1992) showed induction of a 30 and 31kD protein in response to a
short term 32 °C heat stress. Utilizing 1-D SDS-PAGE and western blotting with
the 3A3 anti-Hsp 70 mAb, Sharp et al. (1994) demonstrated constitutive
expression of 28 and 29kD proteins which is enhanced after short term, thermal
stress at 32 °C. Sharp et al. (1994) performed numerous experiments to
demonstrate that the 28 and 29kD doublet of LMW proteins are not products of
proteolytic breakdown of a 70kD Hsp 70. This is also a concern with regard to
the present study
It is possible, but unlikely that the 30kD protein recognized by N27 at 24
and 31 °C is a breakdown product. Three enzyme inhibitors (chymostatin,
leupeptin, and pepstatin) as well as PMSF and the chelating agent ÉDTA are
present in the homogenization buffer. Hsps have characteristic and stable
breakdown products. The 70kD protein in the Hsp 70 family is proteolytically
reduced to two doublets ranging from 40-44kd and 18-22kd (Lindquist, 1986).
No second LMW Hsp 70 cross-reactive protein in the 30-40kd range was
observed in any thermal stress experiments reported on here. Although, it is
possible that only one of the two proteolytic products contains the epitope
recognized by the antibody. However, the varying amount of the 30kD protein
when compared to the 70kD protein (Figs. 4 and 6) is further evidence against
the 30kD protein being a breakdown product. Assuming proteolysis is
proportional to total amount of protein, neither the inducible nor the
constitutive 70kD protein is a likely source of the 30kD protein if it is the
product of proteolysis. Additional evidence that the LMW protein is not a
breakdown product is its absence in the aposymbiotic anemone experiment.
It was not surprising that the 31 °C thermally stressed aposymbiotic
anemone showed the same pattern of inducible and constitutive expression of
