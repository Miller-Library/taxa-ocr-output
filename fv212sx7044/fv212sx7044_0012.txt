protein expression. Low intertidal A. elegantissima subjected to a 48 h, 31 %C
thermal stress, as described by Buchsbaum (1968), resulted in expulsion of algae
within two weeks (see also, O’Brien and Wyttenbach, 1980). Monoclonal
antibodies raised against the highly conserved Hsp 70 family recognized an
induced 70kD protein in the 31 °C heat stressed anemones, however, heat stress
at 24 °C did not show induction of this protein, nor did the animals bleach. This
is of possible interest because 24 °C may not be a physiologically relevant
temperature. Present in both groups of heat stressed anemones were
constitutive Hsp 70 proteins with molecular weights of 30kD and 70kD.
Induction of a 70kD Hsp 70 in symbiotic cnidarians has not been
extensively studied (Bosch et al., 1991; Gellner, K. et al., 1992; Miller et al., 1992;
Hayes and King, 1995), however, its presence in a wider range of marine species
has been more thoroughly described (Ha, 1993, Matorin, 1994; Sanders, 1994).
The N27 anti-murine Hsp 70 mAb was raised against a 70kD heat shock protein
from HeLa cells and is thought to be specific for constitutive and inducible
forms of Hsp 70 (StressGen, Victoria, B.C., Canada; Sanders, 1994). Sanders
(1994) has shown N27 to cross-react with inducible 70kD proteins in 4 species of
fish, 2 species of molluscs, and one species each of crustacean, ground squirrel,
and alga. In the majority of these experiments, Sanders (1994) subjected animals
to hyperthermal stress near their lethal limits. Therefore, it is not surprising
that N27 would recognize a heat-inducible 70kD protein in the 31 °C thermally
stressed anemones (death occurs at 33 °C, Buchsbaum, 1968). However, the lack
of the protein in the 24 °C heat stressed anemones is remarkable in that 24 °C is
a temperature that is beyond the range of physiological relevance as well. Sea
water temperatures at Hopkins Marine Station during the last 75 years varied
from 8 to 19 °C (Barry et al., 1995). A. elegantissima is a low-to-mid intertidal
organism that may encounter temperatures slightly above those at the sea
