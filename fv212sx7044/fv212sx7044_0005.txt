using a plastic pestle and a siliconized microcentrifuge tube. The homogenates
were centrifuged in a microfuge at 4 째C for 12 minutes at 9,000 X g to pellet the
algae. The animal supernatant containing the soluble protein was decanted, and
its protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (1976). The
algae were resuspended in FSW and quantified using a hemacytometer and
algal cell numbers were related to animal protein.
Preparation of A. elegantissima homogenates
Animals sampled both during and after the heat stress were frozen in
liquid N2 and stored at -20째C until further processing. Anemones were
removed from the freezer and finely minced with a razor blade. Protein
samples from each anemone were obtained by grinding whole animals in a 2m.
Teflon-glass homogenizer (Wheaton Instruments, Millville, NJ) with -1.5ml
homogenization buffer: 40 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, ImM
pepstatin, 1mM leupeptin and 10mM chymostatin, pH 7.4. Homogenates were
centrifuged for 12 minutes at 17,500 X g in a microfuge at 4 째C to pellet algae and
animal debris. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged as above a second
time to pellet remaining algae; also, pellets were inspected microscopically for
evidence of lysed and damaged algae, but none was detected. Supernatants were
then kept on ice until resolution by 1-D SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were
determined as described above (Bradford, 1976).
(898]-methionine labeling of A. elegantissima
Symbiotic A. elegantissima in 10ml beakers containing 7ml of FSW were
placed in a recirculating water bath at 15 째C and allowed to adjust to the
temperature for 45 min prior to addition of the isotope. Anemones were
