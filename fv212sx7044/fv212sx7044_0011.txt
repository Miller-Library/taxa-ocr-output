the positive control, however, no 70kD protein is apparent in the control
anemone, lane 2. The 3A3 mAb recognizes a consistent amount of protein in
the heat stressed and control anemones (Fig. 6). An interesting observation is
the lack of a protein at 30kD in both control and heat stressed aposymbiotic
anemones probed with the N27 anti-Hsp 70 mAb (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3).
Comparison of newly-synthesized protein profiles in the 24 °C and 31 °C heat
stressed A. elegantissima
In order to determine the effect of temperature stress on protein profiles
of anemones, sample anemones at different time points were incubated in
LI°9S]-methionine to allow visualization of de novo protein synthesis. The
three time points shown, S24, R24, and R5d show qualitative changes in soluble
proteins in comparison with controls. Figures 8 and 9 are autoradiographs of 31
C and 24 °C heat stressed anemones respectively, incubated for four hours.
Dramatic intensity changes occur with at least four proteins over the
experimental time course in the 31 °C heat stressed anemones (see arrows, Fig.
8). One interesting point in the autoradiograph of the 24 °C heat stressed
anemones is the enhancement of a 29kD protein during the time course (Fig. 9,
see arrow).
Discussion
This study demonstrates the temporal correlation of bleaching and its
associated biochemical changes in a cnidarian-algal symbiosis subjected to
thermal stress; more specifically, it qualitatively and quantitatively describes the
breakdown of the symbiotic relationship and the modifications in heat shock
