pictus to compare the test results from Mytilus to another marine organism. I began testing on C.
fluminea because of its previous use as a test system, as well as its increased chance of higher
musk ketone exposure in freshwater environments (Waldmann et al 1995
Accumulation
For this study, I determined whether musk ketone was an inhibitor of MXR transport by
observing two pathways: accumulation and efflux. A MXR inhibitor would increase the
accumulation of a second MXR substrate by halting MXR active transport [fig. 31. In the
rhodamine B accumulation assay, I examined C. fluminea gill tissue, M. californianus gill tissue,
and L. pictus embryos for the accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence or absence of musk
ketone fig. 3). Rhodamine B accumulation was then observed as relative fluorescence intensity.
Accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence of 2uM musk ketone was seen in L. pictus
fertilized eggs, and M. californianus prepared gill tissue [graph 2, graph 31. Although increased
accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence of musk ketone in C. fluminea was seen, the
variability in the data was too great to draw any conclusions [graph 11.
In order to assess the effects of membrane perturbation, rhodamine B accumulation in M.
californianus was observed in the presence of two membrane-soluble alcohols: ethanol, and 1-
heptanol. Ethanol at 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% in FSW did not have an effect on rhodamine B
accumulation in M. californianus gill tissue, but accumulation of rhodamine B in in M.
californianus gill tissue soaked in 1-heptanol (1mM) was significantly greater than the
accumulation of rhodamine B in a rhodamine B only solution [graph 4, graph 51.
