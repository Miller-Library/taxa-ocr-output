Non-symmetrical Effect
This study indicates that musk ketone is not a classical inhibitor for the MXR efflux
transport, but is acting through an undetermined, alternative pathway to increase the
accumulation of MXR substrates. A classical inhibitor (like verapamil) would show increased
accumulation of rhodamine B and slowed efflux of rhodamine B in the presence of an inhibitor.
Musk ketone acted asymmetrically by increasing rhodamine B accumulation without decreasing
rhodamine B efflux. This increase in accumulation due to the presence of musk ketone was even
verified by the toxicity enhancement assay.
There were many logistical problems with the efflux assay, as seen in the high variability
of the results. I recommend that the assay be refined further before it can be used as a conclusive
way of determining the effects of a compound on rhodamine B efflux. It is possible that musk
ketone did slow rhodamine B efflux and I was unable to detect that result due to experimental
error. However, the efflux assay was repeated on M. californianus multiple times, and musk
ketone efflux tended to mimic the rate of efflux of rhodamine B in FSW more often than the
efflux rate in verapamil although those results could not be statistically supported.
Alternative Hypothesis and Preliminary Testing
Assuming that musk ketone does not slow efflux, musk ketone must be acting on an
alternative pathway to increase accumulation of MXR substrates without decreasing their rate of
efflux. Fert√© suggested alternative points of interaction between the potential inhibitor and MXR
besides an inhibitor to protein interaction. The MXR inhibitor could be changing how the MXR
protein (Pgp) is configured in the membrane, changing how the substrate (e.g. rhodamine B)
