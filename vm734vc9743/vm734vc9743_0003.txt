Introduction
The pervasive, slightly powdery musk scent in many commercial fragrances is due to a
synthetic nitro musk known as musk ketone (1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-4-
acetylbenzene) [fig. 1). It is the foundation for cosmetic, detergent, air freshener, etc. odor, and
an integral component of the fragrance industry. It is also a member of a group of non-priority
pollutants (Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products, PPCP) that has recently attracted a lot
of scientific and media attention because of their persistence in the aquatic environment
(Daughton and Ternes 1999). Because of their ability to resist biodegredation, the concern is that
aquatic organisms are being constantly exposed to PPCP, and that these compounds could
bioaccumulate through food chains.
Musk ketone was first identified in aquatic organisms in Japan in 1981 (Yamagishi et al
1981). In 1995, residue levels from 50.01 to 0.38mg of musk ketone/kg lipid from fish, mussels,
and shrimps were found from freshwater and marine sites near Germany (Rimkus and Wolf
1995). Nitro benzenoid musks were even observed in human adipose tissue and in breast milk
(MÃ¼ller et al 1996). By 1998, musk ketone was beginning to be phased out of German
production and replaced by polycyclic musk fragrances, yet it was still found in measurable
amounts in suspended particulate matter (Winkler et al 1998). Fortunately, musk ketone alone,
in doses of 7.5 to 240mg/kg/day has no known significant effect on mammalian systems, but the
possible synergistic effects that musk ketone may have in conjunction with other aquatic
xenobiotics has not been thoroughly researched (Tas et al 1997).
