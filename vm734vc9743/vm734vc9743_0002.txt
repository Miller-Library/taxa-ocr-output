Abstract
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) have been found in measurable
amounts in receiving waters. These non-priority aquatic pollutants may act in unexpected and
potentially biohazardous ways. One of the more prevalent PPCPs is a perfume ingredient, musk
ketone (1-tert.-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-4-acetylbenzene). I tested musk ketone for its
ability to modulate the accumulation and efflux of xenobiotics known to be substrates of the
multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter using Corbicula fluminea, Lytechinus pictus, Mytilus
californianus, and Mytilus edulis. The multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter (MXR) is a
functional homologue of the mammalian multi-drug resistant transporter (MDR), a P-
glycoprotein. In aquatic systems, MXR serves as a first line of defense against an array of
lipophilic compounds. Musk ketone increased the accumulation of the MXR substrate
rhodamine B in L. pictus embryos, and M. californianus gill tissue; initial testing implicated
accumulation of rhodamine B in C. fluminea. Musk ketone increased the toxicity of vinblastine-
Ã  MXR substrate that inhibits microtubule formation-in L. pictus, but not in M. edulis embryos.
However, musk ketone did not definitively slow the efflux of rhodamine B from L. pictus and M.
californianus suggesting that this chemical is not acting as a classical MXR inhibitor. I conclude
that musk ketone is not acting directly on MXR, and must cause accumulation through an
alternative, yet to be determined, pathway. Statistical analysis: analysis of variance (ANOVA).
and Student-Newman-Keuls test for significant difference, a = 0.05.
