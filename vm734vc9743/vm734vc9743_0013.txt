Efflux
According to the present MXR model, a MXR inhibitor would decrease the rate of efflux
of a second MXR substrate by halting MXR active transport [fig. 41. With MXR inhibition, the
substrate can only leave the cell by passive diffusion. In the efflux assay, I observed the rate of
rhodamine B efflux from L. pictus embryos, and M. californianus gill tissue in the presence or
absence of musk ketone. Musk ketone does not appear to slow efflux in M. californianus gill
tissue (graph 7]. The rate of efflux in L. pictus embryos, however, was highly variable [graph 61.
Embryos washed in 20uM verapamil, the known MXR inhibitor, appeared to be effluxing more
quickly than embryos washed in FSW, contrary to the basic premise of the efflux assay stable 21.
Toxicity Enhancement
The toxicity enhancement assay examined the same mechanism as the accumulation
assay fig. 5]. For the toxicity enhancement assay, I examined fertilized eggs from L. pictus, and
M. edulis for their ability to divide when exposed to vinblastine in the presence or absence of
musk ketone. Essentially, the toxicity assay indirectly measures the accumulation of vinblastine,
a compound that would inhibit cell division if allowed to accumulate in the cell, by observing the
average cell division. The mean number of cells per L. pictus embryo shows a clear depression
of cell division for embryos soaked in musk ketone (at luM and 5uM) plus vinblastine at O.5uM,
which suggests that musk ketone enhances the toxicity of vinblastine in L. pictus [graph 81.
However, the mean number of cells per M. edulis embryo does not show a clear depression of
cell division due to musk ketone exposure in the presence of vinblastine [graph 9]. Vinblastine
