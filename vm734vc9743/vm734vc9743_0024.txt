Graph 4: Accumulation in M. californianus in the Presence of Ethanol. Relative fluorescence is
listed on the Y-axis for each treatment listed in the legend. The error bars are for 6 gill pieces
from a single mussel.
Graph 5: Accumulation in M. californianus in the Presence of 1-Heptanol. Relative
fluorescence intensity is listed on the Y-axis against the treatments on the X-axis. The standard
error is for the variation among the gill tissue of a single mussel.
Graph 6: Efflux in L. pictus. The log of the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI), on the Y-axis,
was measured at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The individual data points are not shown. The lines
shown are the best fit linear regression of the collective data for any individual treatment as listed
in the legend.
Graph 7: Efflux in M. californianus. The log of relative fluorescence intensity on the Y-axis
was calculated for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minute time-points. The individual data points are not
shown. The lines shown are the best fit linear regression of the data for an individual treatment
listed in the legend.
Graph 8: Toxicity Enhancement Assay in L. pictus. The number of cells per embryo was
averaged for at least 200 embryos. The legend lists the concentrations for each bar graph. FSW
fresh seawater, Ver = verapamil, K = musk ketone, Vin = vinblastine. Vinblastine
concentration decreases in the direction of the arrows.
Graph 9: Toxicity Enhancement Assay in M. edulis. The number of cells per embryo was
averaged for at least 200 embryos. The legend lists the concentrations for each bar graph. FSW
= fresh seawater, Ver = verapamil, K = musk ketone, Vin = vinblastine. Vinblastine
concentration decreases in the direction of the arrows.
