After the gill pieces were loaded with dye, they were removed from the rhodamine B
solution and washed with FSW for 10-20 seconds. Then, the tissue was placed into clean dishes
and incubated in various treatment solutions: FSW only; 5uM verapamil in FSW; 5uM musk
ketone in FSW; and 1mM 1-heptanol in FSW. The tissues were then incubated on an orbital
shaker at 15°C. Two methods were used to observe efflux. To examine long term efflux in 5-
minute (and longer) increments, gill pieces were removed from the treatments at the appropriate
time point, placed on microscope slides, and viewed under the fluorescence microscope as for the
accumulation assay. To examine short term efflux in 2-minute increments, images of the same
pieces of tissue per each time point were taken while the tissue remained in the treatment
solution.
The relative fluorescence intensity of a 200x200 pixel area was determined for all tissue
samples using the same equipment as described in the accumulation assay.
Toxicity Enhancement in Lytechinus pictus and Mytilus edulis Ifig. 51
L. pictus were spawned using the same techniques mentioned in the accumulation assay.
M. edulis spawning was induced through heat shocking by placing them into 27°C, UV-treated
FSW. Spawning time for M. edulis was variable; between 2-4 hours. For both L. pictus, and M.
edulis, a solution of approximately 1% eggs was fertilized and placed into a 24- well plate in
ImL aliquots. A different treatment combination from the stock solutions was added to each
aliquot to get the following final concentrations. The four controls contained FSW only (nothing
added), 20uM verapamil, luM musk ketone, or 5uM musk ketone. Then varying concentrations
of vinblastine were added singly and in combination with 20uM verapamil, luM musk ketone,
