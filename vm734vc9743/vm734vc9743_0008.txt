C2400-08) linked to a PC with image analysis software (lmage-1). Images of tissue with as little
damage and mucus as possible were analyzed using Image-1. The relative fluorescence intensity
of a 200x200 pixel area was determined for each piece of gill tissue sampled.
Rhodamine Accumulation in Lytechinus pictus Ifig. 31
L. pictus spawning was induced with the injection of approximately O.1mL O.SM KCI
into the coelomic cavity. A 1% solution of eggs in FSW was fertilized with dry sperm. The 1%
solution was then separated into ImL aliquots in a 24-well plate. Into each well, the appropriate
amount of stock solution was added to create a final concentration of O.25uM rhodamine B only,
O.25uM rhodamine B/20 uM verapamil, 0.25 uM rhodamine B/5 uM musk ketone, or 0.25 uM
rhodamine B/1 mM 1-heptanol. The embryos were allowed to soak for one hour on an orbital
shaker at 15
At the end of the hour, a ImL aliquot for a given treatment was removed, washed with
FSW over a 30u nytex mesh (pores smaller than embryos). The FSW was allowed to drain out
of the mesh, leaving a more concentrated solution of embryos in FSW. Drops of the
concentrated solution were placed onto a microscope slide (no cover slip) and viewed under an
epifluorescent microscope with a rhodamine filter, a 16X objective, and a low light camera as
described in the gill accumulation assay. Images of fertilized eggs were analyzed using Image-1
as described in the accumulation assay in M. californianus. The relative fluorescence intensity of
a 40x40 pixel area was determined for each fertilized egg.
