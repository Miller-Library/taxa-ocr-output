urchin, Lytechinus pictus, and the fresh water clam, Corbicula fluminea also used in this work

In this study, 1 examined whether musk ketone was a substrate for the MXR transporter
and whether it enhanced the toxicity of other known MXR substrates using gill tissue from M.
californianus and C. fluminea, and the fertilized eggs of L. pictus and M. edulis. I found that
musk ketone significantly increases the accumulation of rhodamine B, a known MXR substrate,
in L. pictus, and M. californianus, and enhances the toxicity of vinblastine, another known MXR
substrate, in L. pictus. However, musk ketone did not seem to have an inhibitory effect on the
efflux of rhodamine B in M. californianus. These results suggest that musk ketone can have a
detrimental effect through enhancement of toxicity, but that the mechanism of this enhancement
is not through classical MXR transport.

Organisms
Corbicula fluminea from the Sacramento River delta were kept in indoor tanks supplied with
filtered fresh water near 20°C.
Lytechinus pictus from Marinus, Venice, California, were maintained in outdoor tanks
supplied with filtered seawater at 15°C.
