Methods
The methods for studying rhodamine accumulation and efflux are modified versions of
procedures described by Cornwall et al 1995, and B. Kurelec et al in press.
Rhodamine Accumulation in Mytilus californianus and Corbicula fluminea Ifig. 31
Gill tissue was dissected out of either M. californianus or C. fluminea and placed in
filtered sea water (FSW)-or in the case of the clams, in filtered fresh water (FFW)-on ice. The
tissue was allowed to soak for at least ten minutes to allow excess mucus to flush out. Excess
mucus was removed using forceps. The gills were then cut, dorsal to ventral, using scissors, into
equal sizes as needed.
Prior to adding the gill tissue, petri dishes were set up containing the following final
concentrations in FSW solution for the mussel tissue, and in FFW solution for the clam tissue:
TuM rhodamine B only, 20uM verapamil/luM rhodamine B, varying concentrations of musk
ketone/luM rhodamine B, or varying concentrations of 1-heptanol/1uM rhodamine B.
4-7 pieces of gill tissue were placed into each petri dish and the petri dishes were
incubated at 15Â°C on an orbital shaker for 30-60 minutes. The tissue was then removed from
solution, rapidly washed with FSW (or FFW if clam gill tissue) for 20 seconds, and laid onto
microscope slides so that the gill tissue was flat with as little damage as possible. Tissues were
viewed within 5 minutes of removal from rhodamine B solution.
The fluorescence intensity of gill samples was measured using an epifluorescent
microscope with a rhodamine filter, a 16X objective, and a low light camera (Hamamatsu, model
