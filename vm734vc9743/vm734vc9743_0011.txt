or 5uM musk ketone: for M. edulis concentrations of O.25uM, O.1uM, or O.05uM vinblastine
were used; and for L. pictus concentrations of 1 uM, 0.5 uM, or 0.25 uM vinblastine were used.
There were a total of 16 different treatment conditions for each assay.
The fertilized eggs were then incubated for 4 hours on an orbital spinner at 15°C. After
incubation, cell division was halted with the addition of 10OuL of 10% formaldehyde in FSW to
each ImL aliquot. 1-2 drops from each well were then placed onto a microscope slide with no
cover slip, and examined under a light microscope. At least 200 embryos were counted. For
each embryo, the number of cells was tallied as 1, 2, 4 or 8+ cells, and then averaged over the
total number of embryos counted.
Statistics
Accumulation and toxicity data were analyzed using ANÖVA to detect significant difference. A
Student-Newman-Keuls two-tailed test (« = 0.05) was used to determine which treatments were
significantly different. Efflux data was analyzed for equality of slopes using SYSTAT.
Results
Test Organisms
To examine the effects musk ketone on MXR transport, I needed test organisms with
easily obtainable tissue expressing the MXR protein. I chose M. californianus because of its
previous use as an ideal multi-xenobiotic test system, and M. edulis as a homologue to M.
californianus because of their easier spawning characteristics (Cornwall et al 1995). I used L.
