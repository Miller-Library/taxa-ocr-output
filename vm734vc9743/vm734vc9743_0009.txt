Efflux in Lytechinus pictus Ifig. 41
L. pictus were spawned as described in the accumulation assay and an approximately 1%
solution of L. pictus eggs in FSW was fertilized with dry sperm. Rhodamine B from the stock
solution was added to the solution to a final concentration of O.25uM rhodamine B. The
embryos were then incubated for 1 hour in a beaker on an orbital shaker at 15°C. Wash solutions
were then prepared and stored at room temperature: 5OmL FSW, 5OmL of 20uM verapamil,
50mL of 5uM musk ketone, and 50mL of 1mM 1-heptanol.
At the end of the hour, 4mL of the embryo solution was removed and washed with
approximately 15mL of the appropriate wash solution into a 30u nytex mesh as described in the
accumulation assay above. Äfter the wash solution drained from the mesh the embryos were
collected using a plastic pipette and re-suspended into 4mL of the corresponding wash solution.
This re-suspended solution was divided into ImL aliquots in a 24-well plate; 1mL for each time
point (0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes) and incubated on an orbital spinner at 15°C. At the appropriate
time point, an aliquot was removed and concentrated using the 30u nytex mesh as described in
the accumulation assay above. This concentrated solution was then placed onto a microscope
slide and examined using the same fluorescence analysis as for the accumulation assay.
Efflux in Mytilus californianus Ifig. 4
The gill tissue from M. californianus was prepared as in the accumulation assay. Enough
gill tissue (from 2-4 mussels) was cut so that each treatment and time point had at least 5
samples. All tissue was placed into petri dishes containing luM rhodamine B and incubated on
an orbital spinner at 15°C for one hour.
