interacts with the lipid membrane, or the proposed inhibitor could be acting on an entirely
different transporter or channel (2000).
I began preliminary tests for the relationship between accumulation/efflux and lipid
membrane perturbation. Musk ketone might integrate into the lipid bilayer and create pores that
could increase the amount of rhodamine B accumulation into the lipid bilayer, but would not
prevent rhodamine B efflux. I used ethanol and 1-heptanol to see if they would act to perturb the
membrane and result in an increase in accumulation, but not efflux. Ethanol did not affect
accumulation (Graph 4).
Initial testing with 1-heptanol-which is known to disrupt the core and surface of spinal
neuron membranes-seemed promising (Tapia et al 1998). ImM 1-heptanol does cause a
significant increase in accumulation, but it also causes a significant decrease in efflux. This was
surprising because 1-heptanol does not share many of the characteristics of a MXR substrate. As
these results are preliminary, further refining must be done before any definitive conclusions may
be drawn.
Future Directions
The results of this study point in many future research directions. I recommend that any
attempts to recreate this experiment also include a correlation between relative Pgp concentration
and the accumulation and efflux activity. As the discussion over the species variability shows,
this correlation might account for the variability among species to interfere with determining the
activity of MXR. I would also recommend the pursuit and expansion of the initial 1-heptanol
tests. It would be interesting to see how other known membrane disrupters affect accumulation
and efflux through a systematic look at different anesthetics that often operate through membrane
