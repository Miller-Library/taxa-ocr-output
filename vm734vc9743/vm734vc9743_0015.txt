shown), a much higher concentration of musk ketone than required for a similar response in M.
californianus (increased accumulation at 2-5 uM). This was surprising because C. fluminea
contains relatively little MXR protein (Pgp) compared to M. californianus [western blots
conducted, but data not shown).
Assuming musk ketone acts on MXR in both organisms, these results might simply
reflect the variability of MXR substrate specificity for marine and fresh water organisms. The
substrate binding properties of musk ketone probably might change in fresh water and seawater,
which would cause a difference in the level of rhodamine B accumulation. Another hypothesis is
that musk ketone is not acting on MXR in both or either of these organisms. C. fluminea might
express relatively low concentrations of MXR protein because it utilizes an alternative pathway
to efflux xenobiotics.
Another instance of variable musk ketone activity among species is the difference in L.
pictus and M. edulis embryo response to the toxicity of vinblastine in the presence of musk
ketone. Again, MXR protein concentration should correlate to a cell lineâ€™s ability to efflux a
substrate in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. Higher MXR protein concentration should
correlate with an increase in the difference between accumulation of a substrate in the presence
or absence of an inhibitor. In the accumulation assays, M. californianus, the homologue to M.
edulis, showed a much greater response to the presence of musk ketone than L. pictus [graph 2,
graph 3]. However, in the toxicity assays, L. pictus showed a much greater response to the
presence of musk ketone than M. edulis. This variable response was unexpected because Mytilus
contains relatively higher amounts of MXR protein than L. pictus (Cornwall et al 1995,
Narayanan 1999).
