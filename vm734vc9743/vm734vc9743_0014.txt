shows approximately the same level of toxicity in the presence or absence of musk ketone in M.
edulis embryos.
Statistics for Accumulation and Toxicity Enhancement
Single-factor ANÖVA was used to identify significant interaction among treatments

Discussion and Future Directions
The results for this study were surprising on many levels. First, there was a species
variability in their accumulation and efflux response in the presence of musk ketone. This study
also revealed musk ketone's asymmetrical effects on MXR.
Species Variability
The prevailing theory of MXR activity correlates MXR protein concentration (P¬
glycoprotein) with the ability to efflux a substrate; a cell line containing a high concentration of
MXR protein would be expected to efflux a larger amount of substrate. This would also imply
that a cell line containing a high concentration of MXR protein would require a higher
concentration of MXR inhibitor to elicit the same level of response seen in a cell line containing
a relatively lower concentration of MXR protein. However, I occasionally observed increased
accumulation of rhodamine B in C. fluminea in the presence of 20uM musk ketone sdata not
