In the course of preliminary studies of the genus
Acmaea at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California,
mottled grey-green amphipods were frequently encountered
under the shells of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea digitalis : Exact'>Acmaea digitalis</span> Eschscholtz, 1833,

identified the amphipods as immature specimens of Hyale

have been found in association with any of the above lim¬

ust north of the northern edge of Carmel Bay, California
m 25 April to 30 May 1966. The intense wave action ir
hie area, the presence of vertical granite surfaces
canging to 30 feet above the level of mean lower low water
and the varying conditions of exposure and protection
afforded by large boulders and sheltered pools provide a
variety of different habitats. The sites selected for

the shore side of large boulders. The sites chosen
were divided up into zones (Figures 3-5) based on both
plant and animal indices, and following natural grouping
forganisms on the rocks. Correlation of these zones
with those of Ricketts and Calvin (1939) and Doty (1946)
is shown in Figure 2. Intertidal elevations were
determined by measurement from a United States Geological
Survey bench mark on Pescadero Point and wore checked
against the theoretical tidal heighte as determined from
the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Tables
the Pacific Coast, using the time and height corrections
for Nonterey.
The population of the five species of Acmaea studied
determined by dividing the surface of the campling
sites into quadrats of 400 cm2, and recording numbers
of each Acmaen species present. The total area of each
zone studied in the sampling sites ranged from 2,5 to
3 m2. After determining the distribution and numbers of
Acmaed spp., the distribution and frequency of occurence
of H. grandicornis was determined by sampling of Acmaea
species in the individual zones. Attempts were made to
sollect representative numbers of the five species
studied from each zone but certain species in some areas
were extremely scarce or non-existänt. Extreme care was

needed in collecting, for the amphipods often jump
away when the limpet is lifted from the substrate.
Each limpet collected was then identified, and its
shell length measured. The amphipods present with
each limpet were counted and sorted into three size
groups (0.5-2 mm, 2.-4 mm, and 4.-6 mm),
kinpertten.
Figure 6 shows the population density of each
species of Acmaea for each zone, and the percentage
of each Acmasa species which served as hosts to
H. grandicornis. In Zone A, no amphipode occur
even though suitable hosts are present. The Acma
species of Zone B, slightly lower in the intertidal
but overlapping Zone A, bear a small population of
amphipods. The large bouldere characterizing this
zone shade and protect it from deseidation, keeping
it moister than Zone A. From this point down to the
lowest populations of Acmaea examined, the population
of amphipods increases, with the exception of Zone D.

Samuel E. Johnson
The present studies do not indicate any clear preference
on the part of the amphipods for any particular species of
Acmaea. Moreover, for those limpets which did house amphipods,
there appears to be no clear correlation between the shell length
of the limpet and the number of amphipods present (Figure 7). Howe
ever, for limpets with a shell length of 8 mm or more there does
appear to be a slight positive correlation between shell length
and the percent of the population bearing amphipods (Figure 8).
Limpets less than 8 mm long did not accomodate amphipods.
Natural History
Field examinations carried out at Pescadero Point and at
Mussel Point during day and night and at high and low periods
indicate that the amphipods do not leave the limpet at any time,
unless the latter is removed from the substratum. These obser-
vations are supported by the absence of free-living immature
H. grandicornis in areas adjacent to the limpet populations.
The position of the amphipods under the shell was deter-
mined from laboratory observations using aquaria in which
field conditions were approximated. During the day the
amphipods are found behind the head in the nuchal
Samuel E. Johnse
cavity or deep in the groove between the mantle fold
and the foot. Sometimes an amphipod may be observed
at the edge of the mantle fold, but thie behavior i
rare in the daytime. In conditions of near darkness
and splash or submergence they are found lying on
their eides, in contact with the pallial tentaeles of
the limpet at the mantle margin. In this position the
amphipods groom themselves, and from it they also feed,
reaching around the edge of the shell or moving completel.
out onto its dorsal surface and seraping up the algae
growing there. Gut contente were unidentifiable, but
the material on the shell is composed of numerous
varities of diatoms and several types of blue-green
algae, primarily <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Enteromorpha : Exact'>Enteromorpha.</span> Occasionally small
growthe of Ulva are found on the shells. The amphipod
seem never to leave the limpet, but seek cover under
the sbell when disturbed. If an amphipod is trapped
outside and is unable to crawl under the host's shell
again, it either presses itself closely against the
edge of the shell and remains there, or moves away t
a nearby limpet. Other types of shelter, either in
field or laboratory, appear to be ignored. When
forced to awim, H. grandicornis moves very rapidly a
first, but quickly slows and appears to seek shelter.
If repeatedly disturbed, it soon ceases all movement.
Samuel E. Johnson
It is of particular interest that Dr. Barnard found
mature specimens of Hyale grandicornis in Ulva, and that
the present study has revealed only juvenile individuals
in the mantle groove and nuchal caviti of Acmaea. Ulva
occurs mainly in the warmer months in the region studied,
and at the end of the present study it was just beginning
to grow. Perhaps the immature forms of Hyale grandicornis
migrate to the Ulva as they attain sexual maturity and as
the alga appears each summer, and possibly the juvenile
amphipods survive during the winter and spring under Acmaea
shells.
The author plans to continue research on the problem.
Summary
1. Immature specimens of Hyale grandicornis (Krøyer, 1845)
are found in the nuchal cavity and pallial groove in five
species of Acmaea and in Lottia gigantea.
2. The percentage of limpets hosting immature H. grandicernis
increases with decreasing height in the intertidal region.
The amphipod shows no clear preference for particular lim-
pet host species.
4. No amphipods were found in any limpets less than 8 mm in
shell length. For limpets above this size there is a slight
positive correlation between shell length and the percent
of limpets bearing amphipods. However, for those limpets
which housed amphipods, there was no correlation between
