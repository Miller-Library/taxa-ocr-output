ABSTRACT
Because zebrafish continue to grow throughout their adult life, they are constantly
generating and differentiating new neural tissue. The periventricular zone (PVZ) of the optic
tectum, given its generalized, undifferentiated cell morphology, is a possible source of neural
precursor cells whose migration into the tectum and differentiation into several different neural
fates may be the source of tectal growth. GFP lipofection of brain cross-slices indicated that at
least some of these cells are dividing much of the time. We developed a novel procedure for the
isolation of PVZ cells and demonstrated growth of neurospheres in culture from these
progenitors when driven under various growth factors (Insulin, IGF, Retinoic acid, BFGF).
Additionally, preliminary antibody staining suggests that at least a subset of these PVZ cells
express the Notchl receptor in vivo, suggesting the possibility of using this receptor as a specific
marker for neural progenitor cells.
