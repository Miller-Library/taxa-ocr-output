ZuL of FITC-labeled bovine antigoat IgG was added (sc-2348, Santa Cruz Biotech) to each slice
which was incubated rocking at room temperature for 2 hours. The slices were then rinsed 3
times and washed an additional 4 times for 15 minutes in PBS-D-Tw, rinsed in PBS-D, and
placed back in PBS. Finally, the slices were imaged using the confocal microscope.
RESULTS
Biolistics micrographs emphasized the morphological differences between the tectum and
the PVZ (see Fig. 1). Cross-sections of the tectum showed mostly longitudinal striations of
cellular processes, whereas the PVZ consisted of round cell bodies without processes. However.
the boundary is not very clearly delineated and some linear protrusions appear to descend from
the tectal striated layers into the PVZ.
The GFP transfected cultures demonstrated the occurrence of cellular division and the
presence of post-mitotic cells in the tectum and PVZ area (see Fig. 2). The CMV promoted
EGFP and the GFP with a generalized promoter seemed to work equally well. Some cells were
caught in the act of dividing (see Fig. 3). It is not known whether these cells are in the tectum or
in the PVZ.
The tectal prints demonstrated cellular division in culture and neurosphere formation (see
Fig. 4). An IGF/insulin combination in defined medium drove the growth of neurospheres to a
density 3 times greater than insulin alone and produced considerably larger neurospheres after a
12 day incubation (see Fig. 5a). IGF and insulin also out-performed retinoic acid and BFGF by
encouraging larger neurosphere size and higher neurosphere concentration after a 34 day
incubation (see Fig. 6). The average size of an individual neurosphere cell was 4.2um whereas
the average size of the parental PVZ cells was 6.3um (see Fig. 7a). The range in neurosphere
