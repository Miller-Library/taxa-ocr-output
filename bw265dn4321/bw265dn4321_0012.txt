Figure 1: Biolistics micrographs demonstrating the morphology of the tectum and the PVZ by
DilOC6 staining. Images taken with a confocal microscope using a 40x water lens. In both
cases the PVZ is on the left and the striated tectum is on the right. Arrows denote cellular
processes extending into the PVZ layer.
