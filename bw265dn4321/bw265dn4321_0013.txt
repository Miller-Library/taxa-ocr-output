Figure 2a,b,c.d: Micrographs of GFP-lipofected organotypic culture. Post-mitotic cells
apparent in the tectum/PVZ. 2c: Micrograph from area 11 in Fig. 2d demonstrating dividing
cells in deep tectal tissue, far from blade path. 2d: representation of the posterior portion (dorsal
view) of a brain sliced crossways through the tecta. Brainstem at top, blade path at bottom, tecta
are the two large lobes on left and right.
