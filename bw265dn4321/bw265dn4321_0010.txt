differentiation of these neural precursor cells. Ã–ther proteins may prove to be useful markers as
well, including the protein product of tai-ji, a gene expressed in various parts of the adult
zebrafish brain and in human neuronal precursor cell line hNT2 (Huang et al., 1998)
CONCLUSION
Tectal printing has demonstrated that cells from the PVZ are self-renewing under
IGF/insulin treatment in defined medium; differential cell size and neurosphere growth suggest
some differentiation in culture. It remains to be shown whether the cultured cells have
characteristics of either glia or neurons. GFP lipofection was useful as an assay for mitotic cells
in organotypic culture and showed the presence of divided cells in the tectum and the PVZ; a
slight change to the slicing procedure may elucidate the exact location of division and the
presence or absence of any subsequent migration. This hypothetical sequence of events may be
controlled by interactions between widely separated cell bodies suggested by biolistics imaging
of cell processes which transverse the boundary between the striated tectum and the PVZ. Such
interaction may involve the Notch receptor pathway as a Notch receptor is expressed in a subset
of PVZ cells and exists as a potential marker for the maintenance of the neural progenitor cell
state.
