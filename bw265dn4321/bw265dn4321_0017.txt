Figure 6: Neurosphere sizes and concentrations from dual tectal print cultures incubated in
defined medium with 10 mM insulin. Aster 12 days in culture, 20 uM retinoic acid and ZUM
BFGF were added to one culture. Neurosphere sizes and concentrations were determined after a
total of 35 days in culture.
