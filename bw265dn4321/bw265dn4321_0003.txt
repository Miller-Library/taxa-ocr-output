tectum and PVZ given that only a cell going through the latter stages of mitosis (no nuclear
envelope) can express introduced DNA, having reformed the nuclear envelope around the new
gene.
Although in vivo analysis is instrumental to the identification of potential neural
progenitors, demonstration of division and differentiation can be done most easily in vitro. This
study describes a novel tectal print method for the isolation and amplification of PVZ cells in
culture using insulin, IGF, bFGF, and retinoic acid in defined medium. Neurosphere sizes and
concentrations were evaluated for each growth factor treatment and cultured cell size was
compared to parental PVZ cell size.
A marker specific for neural precursors would be inherently useful for any
characterization of the regulation of their maintenance and differentiation. The Notch family of
receptors, although active in a wide variety of differentiation pathways, may provide such a
marker. Notchl pathway signaling has been implicated in the inhibition of neuronal
differentiation (Faux et al., 2001) and in the maintenance of mammalian neural stem cell state
(Hitoshi et al., 2002). We used immunohistochemistry to explore the Notchl receptor as a
potential marker for neural progenitor cells of the PVZ.

A zebrafish brain was removed in dissection media (80% PBS with 10mM HEPES and
5% Penstrep adjusted to pH 7.4) and placed on a piece of millipore paper. The paper was placed
onto a cold chopping block and the brain cut into cross-slices. The cross-slices were placed on a
