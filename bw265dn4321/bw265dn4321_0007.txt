Cross-sections stained for the Notchl demonstrated that blood vessels in the brain (not
shown) as well as a small subset of cells in the PVZ (see Fig. 8) expressed a Notch family
receptor in high enough quantities and with enough homology to the mammalian Notchl to stain
with a polyclonal anti-human Notch-1.
DISCUSSION
Some processes crossing the boundary into the PVZ (see Fig. 1) suggest that there may
be tectal control over the fate of PVZ cells including division, migration, and differentiation.
Conversely, the control may be in the way of PVZ cells sending processes into the tectum itself.
Either way, there is likely signaling occurring between distant cells that organizes the movement
between layers. An injection of lipophilic dye into the tectal layers may determine the location
of the cell bodies associated with these processes. An early study with horseradish peroxidase
used a similar method to determine the location of processes afferent to the tectum from other
parts of the brain (Northcutt, 1984).
GFP lipofection was successful in demonstrating cell division subsequent to dissection in
the PVZ and tectum (see Fig. 2 and 3). Given the slicing technique used (one slice dividing the
brain into anterior and posterior sections), the assignment of post-mitotic cells into only striated
tectum or only PVZ was challenging as discrimination of adjacent tissue layers under
fluorescence is difficult in deep tissue. However, the use of relatively large tissue sections had
merit in that it left large areas of tissue far from the blade path and relatively undisturbed. The
presence of dividing cells in tissue away from the traumatized edge (see Fig 2c and 2d) suggests
