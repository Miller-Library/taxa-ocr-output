glass slide and bombarded with DilOC6-coated gold bullets of .6um diameter using a Helios
Gene Gun (Biorad). The slices were then viewed using a confocal microscope.
EGFP Transfection of Organotypic Culture
A zebrafish brain was removed in sterile dissection media (80% PBS with 10mM HEPES
and .5% Penstrep adjusted to pH 7.4) and placed on a piece of millipore paper. The paper was
placed onto a cold chopping block and the brain was sliced once through the tecta into anterior
and posterior sections. These were placed in a petri dish, still on the filter paper, and left under a
drop of dissection media. Lipofection took place according to the CellFECTIN protocol (Life
Technologies) using either a GFP gene with a generalized promoter and a Clonetch EGFP gene
with a CMV promoter (pEGFP-CI Vector, Catt 6084-1). 6uL of CellFECTIN reagent was
diluted into 10OuL of 80% DMEMF12 in an Eppendorf tube and 2ug of DNA was similarly
diluted into 100uL in a different Eppendorf tube. Neither Penstrep nor serum were used in
media as they may limit the efficiency of transfection. Both tubes were mixed by inverting
several times and then combined and left shaking for 15 minutes. An additional 800uL of 80%
DMEMF12 was added to the solution before it was introduced to the petri dish containing slices.
The slices were incubated overnight before the media was replaced with a solution of 80%
DMEM/F12 with .05% Penstrep and 10uM insulin and 25ngmL IGF. The organotypic cultures
were left for 2 to 7 days in the incubator before imaging on the confocal microscope.
Tissue Print Method for Isolating Periventricular Zone Cells
The tecta were dissected out of the brain of an adult zebrafish under sterile conditions in a
solution of 80% PBS with 10mM HEPES and 5% Penstrep adjusted to pH 7.4. Each tectum was
