placed on a dry patch of millipore paper with the PVZ side in contact with the millipore paper,
then gently scraped off and the millipore paper was suspended upside down in a solution of 80%
DMEM/F12 and .5% Penstrep and placed in an incubator. As two tecta may be harvested from
each dissection, a dual-well glass-bottomed slide was used for each pair of prints with different
growth factors added to each well. The growth factors used were insulin at 1OuM, IGF at
25ng/mL, BFGF at 3uM, or Retinoic Acid at 20uM. After several days, the pieces of millipore
paper were removed from the cultures and placed in new media to seed new cultures. Tissue
prints could yield at least secondary cultures and sometimes tertiary cultures, resulting in as
many as 6 different cell cultures from a single fish. Neural ball counts and size estimates were
made periodically during several weeks of growth in culture.

A zebrafish brain was removed in dissection media (80% PBS with 10mM HEPES and
5% Penstrep adjusted to pH 7.4) and placed on a piece of millipore paper. The paper was placed
onto a cold chopping block and the brain cut into cross-slices, which were fixed in 4%
paraformaldahyde overnight at 4’C, washed with 25%, 50%, and 75% methanolPBS and left in
100% methanol at -20’C until staining (at least 4 hours). The slices were washed again using the
reversed methanol/PBS series and rinsed several times with PBS-Tw. Each slice was placed in
300uL blocking solution (horse serum, kindly provided by the B. Block lab) and left for 10
minutes shaking gently. 3uL of polyclonal goat antiNotchl IgG (sc-6015, Santa Cruz Biotech)
was added to each slice which was incubated shaking at room temperature for 2 hours. The
slices were then rinsed 3 times and washed an additional 4 times for 15 minutes in PBS-D-Tw
and placed back in 300uL of blocking solution (horse serum) for another 10 minutes shaking.
