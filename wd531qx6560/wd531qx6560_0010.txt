to swim or move quickly away from a predator once the predator
attacks. Robison (1992) notes that the glowing skin of the
holothurian Enypniastes eximia is adherent and might serve to
temporarily mark its aggressor in such a way that a predator of the
aggressor would be able to find the aggressor. Studies of Pannychia
behavior in the presence of possible predator species should prove
fruitful in determining the functional role of its bioluminescence.
