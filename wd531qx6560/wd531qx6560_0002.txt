Introduction
Pannychia moseleyi Théel, 1882 is broadly distributed along
the coasts of the Pacific from Australia and Indonesia to Canada and
Peru, and off the Hawaiian Islands. It is found at depths between
212 m and 2598 m (Hansen, 1975). Pannychia (Fig. 1) is a benthic
sea cucumber which can be found laying in flat, open spaces as well
as clinging to ledges. There is an extensive amount of variation in
the species with regard to coloration, number of tube feet (Hansen,
1975), and dorsal papillae size.
Herring (1974) and Robison (1992) examined bioluminescence
in holothurians, including another member of Pannychia's family,
Laetmogone violacea. In most of these species, the bioluminescence
was described as a scattering of points of light on the body surface
and the tips of tentacles, tube feet, and papillae.
Materials and Methods
In situ observations, video photography, and collection were
conducted using the remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) 'Ventana' on
cruises of the research vessel Point Lobos' in the Monterey bay. Six
specimens, collected on 12 March 1992, were taken from depths of
458 m to 470 m. Six more, collected on 9 April 1992, were taken
from depths of 517 m to 555 m. One specimen, not taken using the
ROV, was collected on the outside of a black cod trap at 1116 m.
Upon being brought aboard ship, the animals were kept in
darkened containers of sea water at approximately 5°C before being
transferred to chilled-water tanks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
Monterey, CA. Each March-collected specimen was placed in its own
5-gal. tank with deep-sea mud as the substrate. Two of the April¬
