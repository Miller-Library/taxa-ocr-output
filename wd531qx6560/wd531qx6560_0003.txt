collected specimens and the 'cod trap' specimen were also placed in
5-gal. tanks. The four remaining April-collected specimens were put
in one 2' x 3' x 2' tank. The substrate for this tank was mud taken
from the Elkhorn Slough at Moss Landing, CA. All 5-gal. tanks were
kept in the dark, while the large tank was kept in light.
Preliminary Investigation
The animals were stimulated to bioluminesce by lifting them
from their rest position, by hand, and allowing them to sink to the
bottom of the tank. The pattern and duration of the light were
noted. Following stimulation, animal length measurements were
taken.
Spectral Analysis
Bioluminescence spectra were taken from tissue samples of
unpreserved specimens kept in cold sea water. The tissue was
stimulated by immersing it in fresh water and prodding it with a
metal rod to increase the light output. Spectra were measured with
an EG&G Princeton Applied Research Model 1215 optical
multichannel analyzer (ÖMA) using a linear array detector consisting
of 700 intensified silicon photodiodes. A 1-mm entrance slit was
used. Details of calibration and operation have been described
previously (Widder et al, 1983). Two spectra taken consecutively
from a single tissue sample were summed to increase the signal-to¬
noise ratio. The resulting waveform was corrected for background
noise and smoothed.
Primary Investigation
Animals were stimulated by gently rubbing the dorsal surface
with a fingertip. Video recordings of bioluminescent activity were
