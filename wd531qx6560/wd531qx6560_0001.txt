Abstract
Pannychia moseleyi is a commonly found benthic organism
living at depths greater than 400 m in the Monterey Bay canyon.
Observations in the laboratory have shown that, upon tactile
stimulation, Pannychia produces blue-green spiral and quasi-circular
waves of bioluminescence over the entire body surface except the
podia, papillae and tentacles. Video analysis showed dispersion in
traveling waves, i.e. the wave velocity at a point depends on the time
elapsed since the previous wave passed that point. Annihilation was
observed to occur when waves collided. This leads to the conclusion
that the mechanism of bioluminescence behaves as an excitable
medium with a refractory period of ยง 0.5 seconds. There appear to
exist regions on the body surface which are incapable of
bioluminescing. These banded unexcitable zones are arranged
diagonally with respect to the horizontally-oriented animal.
