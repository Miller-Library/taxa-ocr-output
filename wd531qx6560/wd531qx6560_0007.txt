The emission maximum and half bandwidth values (480, 80) of
Pannychia bioluminescence fall approximately in the middle of the
range of the two other members of the Laetmogonidae family which
are known to bioluminesce (Herring, 1983). Laetmogone violacea has
the values (470, 70). Taking the average of the four measurements
reported by Herring, one obtains the values for Benthogone rosea,
(480, 90). Two of the four measurements, however, indicated that
there were shoulders at 505 nm on an otherwise unimodal spectrum
which implies that the emission from B. rosea has a substantial green
component. This fact becomes interesting when one considers the
depth ranges in which these species are found (Fig. 8).
Bathymetrically speaking, Pannychia is found between Laetmogone
and Benthogone (Hansen, 1975). This indicates that there may be
some correlation between depth and emission spectral properties.
would be necessary to study other families containing
bioluminescent members to determine if this is a general trend.
Perhaps the most significant finding is that the bioluminescent
mechanism found in Pannychia behaves as an excitable medium; i.e.,
a system which when excited above a critical point by a stimulus
requires a refractory period to recover its excitability (Lechleiter et
al, 1991). Undamaged cardiac muscles are an important example of
excitable media (Winfree, 1989). Some characteristics of excitable
media include rotating spiral waves, dispersion effects and wave
annihilation (Gerhardt et al, 1990), all of which were observed to
occur in in vivo Pannychia bioluminescence.
The spiral waves were observed to rotate only in the clockwise
direction. It is not clear whether this is a general rule. Epstein
