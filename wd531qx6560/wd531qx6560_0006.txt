spacing, the higher the wave velocity. Observations showed that the
velocity was tending toward some maximum.
As the waves moved over the body surface, it was clear that
some regions were never illuminated. These regions were arranged
along the entire body length in diagonal bands with respect to the
horizontally-oriented animal. These banded unexcitable zones,
(Fig. 7), do not travel with the wave, but remain in a fixed position
on the body surface as the waves pass over them. The banded
unexcitable zones are the gray bands shown in the figure.
Discussion
Pannychia bioluminescence has been seen to occur only on the
body surface, unlike most of the other members of the Elasipod order
which display luminescence on the tentacles, papillae, and/or tube
feet (Herring, 1974). In addition, the dynamic nature of Pannychia's
bioluminescence is unlike that of any of the holothurians studied by
Herring (1974, 1978) or Robison (1992).
Although a good correlation has not been demonstrated
between animal size and duration of bioluminescent activity, this can
not be ruled out. During the collection process, the animals are
subjected to varying degrees of stress and physical injury. Thus, if a
smaller specimen is in better condition than a larger specimen, it is
possible that its bioluminescence would last longer. The tendency for
the mid-section of an animal to stop bioluminescing before the
posterior and anterior ends correlates with Smith's (1965) assertion
that the middle region of holothurians is the least sensitive to
mechanical stimulation.
