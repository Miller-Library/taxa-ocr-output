taken with a Cohu Model 5000 silicon-intensified tube (SIT) camera.
Stimulation was maintained until bioluminescence ceased. Traces
were drawn directly from the video monitor at successive frame
intervals to study bioluminescent wave propagation. Wave velocities
were calculated by measuring the distance of the wave front from a
given point 0.1 s before reaching that point.
Results
Preliminary Investigation
Only a mild correlation between animal length and duration of
bioluminescent activity was observed (Fig. 2). While there is a high
degree of scatter in the data, the larger specimens were able to
sustain light longer in general.
Eight of the thirteen specimens bioluminesced in a combination
of pinwheel and quasi-circular waves (Fig. 3). Typically, the entire
main surface area of the body (excluding tube feet, papillae, and
tentacles) would light up almost at once. The luminous activity
would continue for a time before dying out. The mid-section would
die out first, leaving only the anterior and posterior ends still
bioluminescing. In one of these eight, a soft glow near the anterior
and posterior ends followed the period of dynamic, luminous activity.
Three of the specimens produced rectangular bands of order 1
cm length travelling along both ventro-lateral sides. These were
relatively short episodes (3.1 s, 6.9 s, and 7.0 s.) All three of these
animals had been kept in the large tank. Two simply emitted points
of light distributed over most of the body surface.
