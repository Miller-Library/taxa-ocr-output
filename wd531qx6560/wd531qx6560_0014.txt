Figure Legend
Sketch of Pannychia moseleyi.
Duration of bioluminescent activity following mechanical
stimulation vs. animal size.
Typical wave patterns seen in Pannychia bioluminescence.
Smoothed spectrum of Pannychia bioluminescence.
Time lapse sketch of the annihilation of two high intensity
waves and the associated point source which develops as they
approach each other.
Dispersion relation for bioluminescent waves. The points are
measurements taken directly from the screen. The bars are
errors in measuring velocity due to the uncertainty of the
actual location of the wave front.
Banded Unexcitable Zones in bioluminescent waves. White
areas are regions of bioluminescence in this cut-away view of
the animal. The waves are propagating from left to right, while
the banded unexcitable zones remain stationary.
Bathymetric distribution of three bioluminescent members of
the Laetmogonidae family. A summary of their spectrum
characteristics is also shown.
