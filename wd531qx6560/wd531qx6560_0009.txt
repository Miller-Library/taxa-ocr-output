the location of epidermal luminous cells in L. violacea and B. rosea,
but did not report on how they were distributed in the tissue.
The nature of Pannychia bioluminescence with regards to its
nervous system is still unclear. Smith (1965) reports that strong
localized stimuli in holothurians causes reactions to spread to
neighboring areas. This may imply transmission through a nerve
net. Although the pathways for conduction are not known for
certain, Smith (1965) postulates that certain phenomena are
transmitted through "afferent and efferent paths connected with the
nerve cord." Facilitation, he adds, is required in the neuronal
synaptic junctions.
The function of bioluminescence in Pannychia is a subject for
debate. Although holothurians are assumed to have body surfaces
which are sensitive to light (Hyman, 1955), I have not been able to
show this conclusively in Pannychia. Since bioluminescence is
initiated upon tactile stimulation, it is reasonable to conclude that its
primary function is predator evasion. Morin (1983) has given a
thorough description of behavioral functions of bioluminescence.
may have a temporary blinding effect on a dark-adapted predator,
which Morin (1983) refers to as the "flash bulb effect." Also, since
Pannychia is able to sustain its light for several seconds, the
bioluminescence may serve to warn the predator that its prey is
invulnerable to attack or would be a distasteful food item (Morin,
1983). The sustained light may also serve to attract an organism
which preys on Pannychia's predator; this is the so-called burglar
alarm effect put forth first by Burkenroad (1943). The latter
functions seems to be the most appropriate since Pannychia is unable
