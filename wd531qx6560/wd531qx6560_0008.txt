(1991) notes that a pacemaker nucleus is required to generate
periodic supercritical perturbations. The pulsing period of 0.5 s for
the quasi-circular waves appears to be an upper limit for and
possibly very close to the actual refractory period of the the medium.
Nicol (1955) found that the refractory period for the bioluminescence
mediated in a nerve net in Renilla k√∂llikeri was around 0.2-0.5 s
indicating that 0.5 s for Pannychia places it in a reasonable
physiological range. From figure 6 one can see that the wave
velocity approaches a limiting value of about 4 cm/s which is again a
reasonable velocity for conduction of signals through the nervous
system. (Nicol (1955) found a value of 7.8 cmls in Renilla.)
The strong wave annihilation is an interesting phenomenon
about which I propose the following to describe its mechanism. The
wave of luminescence travels at the same velocity as the stimulus
(assumed to be neuronal activity), but lags behind slightly because of
the finite amount of time required to excite the medium. In a strong
wave there is a strong stimulus which, when it encounters another
strong stimulus traveling towards it, excites an area between the two
strong waves more quickly than if there had only been one stimulus
to excite the area. The area is illuminated before either wave has
reached it. This point source grows until all three collide and are
annihilated.
The origin of the banded unexcitable zone pattern is
speculative. Perhaps it is simply caused by the papillae obstructing
the view of the light or perhaps the luminous cells are organized in
banded patterns. I was unable to determine the location of luminous
cells in Pannychia. Herring (1974) found circumstantial evidence for
