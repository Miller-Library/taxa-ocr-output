Spectral Analysis
The emission spectrum for Pannychia bioluminescence is
shown in figure 4. The maximum intensity occured at approximately
480 nm while the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value was
about 80 nm (450 nm to 530 nm). There is a slight asymmetry
toward longer wavelengths.
Primary Investigation
The video analysis confirmed the existence of clockwiseÂ¬
turning spiral waves and pulsing quasi-circular waves emanating.
radially outward, from source points. The period of the pulsing
sources was approximately 0.5 s. The quasi-circular waves would
change their mode of propagation and become cycling spirals.
Lechleiter (1991) noticed this phenomenon in his observations of
propagating waves of Ca2+ release in Xenopus laevis oocytes. (The
ventro-lateral band pattern was not seen at this stage of the
investigation.) Annihilation was observed to occur when traveling
waves of any type collided with one another. High intensity colliding
waves underwent what I termed a strong wave annihilation (Fig. 5).
In this scenario, an intermediate point source is formed as the high
intensity waves approach each other. The point source grows while
the high intensity waves close in on it. All three collide and are
annihilated.
The wave dispersion relation (Fig. 6) shows the dependence of
wave velocity on the time spacing of the waves. The speed of a wave
passing through a particular point depends on the amount of time
elapsed since the previous wave passed that point; the larger the
