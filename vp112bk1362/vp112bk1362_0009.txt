scarce or lacking from transects near the outfall, e.g. the
larger limpets, starfish, and sea urchins. Figure 20 is a
summary of this transect material and records the relative
distribution and abundance of the fauna, and exhibits those
species which can be said to be evidently affected by the
effluent, e.g. Mytilus californianus, Mitella polymerus,
Balanus glandula, Chthamalus spp., and Tetraclita squamosa
rubescens.
These results were supported by the data gathered in the
distribution squares study. The faunal distribution studies
were done at eight stations along the shoreline corresponding
to transects 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (cf. Figure 9).
Tables 3-7 show the population counts from each of five types
of areas (described on pp. 4-5) at each of the eight stations.
Note the decrease in the number of species, the ratio of live
to dead barnacles, and the diversity indices in the outfall
region (Stations 2-6). The larger limpets such as Acmaea
limatula, A. scutum, A. pelta, Diodora spp., and Lottia gigantea
are scarce or lacking in this region. The relative abundance
and distribution of tunicate species are tabulated in Table 8.
Again the lack of species in Stations 2-6 is very noticeable.
Limpet Toxicity
Figures 2la-j are concerned with the LT50 experiments
(time required for 50% of the population to die) for Acmaea
digitalis and A. scutum. It is apparent that up to concentrations
of 20% sewage, chlorine significantly reduces the LT50. The
LT50 are compiled for the different concentrations of sewage
in Table 9, and range from 32 hours for 2% unchlorinated sewage
to 4 hours for 100% chlorinated sewage. Although these tests
were not conclusive due to the small sample size, it is evident
adult limpet populations are affected quickly by sewage effluent.
