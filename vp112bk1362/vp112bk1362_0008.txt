station with the second highest value a ranking of 2, etc.
If two stations had the same value for an analyses, they were
given the same ranking. Ranking was plotted against station
and Figure 8 shows a marked similarity between the widely
different types of chemical tests. There appears to be a
differential dispersion of the effluent with Stations D, E,
F, and G receiving the most contact with the sewage. This
information supports the current study evidence of the southward
movement of the effluent.
The sewage from the Carmel outfall is of domestic origin,
and therefore, pH readings and heavy metal concentrations were
not expected to be extreme. At the outfall, the water was
acidic with a reading of 6.6. But 50 feet to either side of
the outfall the pH readings were neutral at 7.0 and remained
so the rest of the way along the shore both to the north and
south. Six metals were tested for with the atomic absorption
spectrophotometer. These were copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury,
lead, and chromium. Only zinc and copper appeared in appreciable
amounts, snd neither was very much greater than normal concentrations
in sea water.
Although these chemical tests were of a short term nature,
it is importanit to note that the results show a similar pattern
which correlates to the currents in the area. There is also
a relatively low dilution of some of the fundamental components
of the sewage, such as hydrogen sulfide, at distances over 1000
feet away from the outfall.
Faunal Distribution
The locations of the transects are displayed in Figure 9.
These locations were selected in areas where current studies
and chemical tests had been achieved so correlations would be
evident. Observations from the transect studies are graphically
represented in Figures 10-19. Certain species are obviously
