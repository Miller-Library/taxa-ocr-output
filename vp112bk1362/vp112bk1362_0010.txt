DISCUSSTON
It was evident at the time of the mapping and current
studies that there existed a strong southward current from the
mouth of the outfall. The current extended down to Monastery
Beach, with several drift bottles ending up about 100 feet north
of this beach and approximately 2000 feet south of the outfall.
There is also evidence currents may be carrying the effluent
as far as north Point Lobos below Whaler's Cove about 4000 feet
south of the outfall. If the effluent were to reach this area,
it would tend to remain there because of the circular currents
near Monastery Beach shown to exist in the second current study.
The high recovery rate of drift bottles, nearly 60% within two
weeks after the second study, shows the effluent is not moving
out to sea, and thus, may have an even larger affect on the
marine intertidal fauna within Carmel Bay, especially to the
south of the Carmel outfall.
In the immediate area of the outfall the effluent appeare
to wash straight back into the beach area directly behind the
pipe. The area to the north of the pipe for an estimated 100
feet received a heavy wash of effluent, which eventually joined
the larger southward movement of water. The extreme north end
of the outfall rocks and the area about 160 feet south of the
outfall were not as heavily washed with effluent as the rest
of the immediate outfall area, suggesting that currents may
bypass Stations C and E (cf. Figure 6).
The apparent dilution of effluent from the mouth of the
outfall southward is not large. At a point approximately 600
feet south of the Carmel outfall, nitrites had been diluted
only 58% and hydrogen sulfide 69%. The area 250 feet north
of the outfall at the end of the immediate outfall area gave
test results often comparable to areas much farther away from
the outfall, such as Station B at Mission Point to the north,
and Station I at north Point Lobos to the south. Also from the
