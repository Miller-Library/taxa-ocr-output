SUMMARY
This research project examined the effects of primary
treated effluent on the distribution and abundance of marine
intertidal fauna in a portion of Carmel Bay, California.
During the time of the current studies, the effluent was
moving south from the outfall and appeared to remain in the
Monastery Beach area due to circular currents. The sewage
was not moving straight out to sea.
Damage in the outfall area can be seen in the form of
distribution patterns and are reflected in the diversity indices
for specific types of areas. The distribution patterns suggest
that Mytilus californianus (California mussel), Mitella polymerus
(Gooseneck barnacle), Balanus glandula, Chthamalus spp., Tetraclita
squamosa rubescens, Acmaea spp., Pisaster ochraceus, Pagurus spp.,
Haliotis cracherodii may be good intertidal indicators of
and
sewage pollution.
Toxicity tests on Acmaea digitalis and A. scutum suggest
that at low concentrations of sewage, Cl, may be responsible
for much of the lethality of the sewage. However, Cl, does
not account for the entire toxicity of any concentration of
sewage
The research outlined in this paper suggests further
investigations are necessary to confirm present information
about current and effluent movement in Carmel Bay, the toxicity
of sewage due to Cl,, the toxicity of other sewage components,
distribution and diversity patterns as measurable parameters
of sewage pollution, and the development of other types of
indicators of sewage pollution.
