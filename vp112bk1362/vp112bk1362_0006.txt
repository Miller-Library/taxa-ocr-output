limpets were given ample space, and were left outside to be
exposed to the natural light regime. The salinity loss due
to the inclusion of the fresh water sewage was approximated
in the controls for each concentration by using an appropriate
volume of distilled water in the control dishes. The mortality
rate of the limpets was recorded at eight time intervals covering
a span of 32 hours. The controls were examined over a total
period of 53 hours. Death was established if the limpet did
not attach to the dish and its tentacles did not respond to touch.

Current Studies
The currents recorded on May 11, 1970 are seen in Figure 3.
These 12 drift bottles moved in an uniform direction southward
towards Monastery Beach. The second group of 12 bottles were
laid in the line close to where the first group of bottles
were last sighted. This study took place on May 25, 1970,
and as Figure 4 shows, these bottles moved in a circular
pattern and ended up approximately 100 feet offshore at the
north end of Monastery Beach. The compass readings taken
from shore positions for these two groups of bottles are
shown in Table la and 1b, respectively. Table 2 gives the
dates and locations of bottle recovery. The recovery rate for
the bottles is high, especially for the second current study.
The data from these two studies gives evidence to suggest
that the effluent is moving in a southerly direction towards
Monastery Beach, and might even be reaching north Point Lobos
below Whaler's Cove about 4000 feet south of the outfall. One
drift bottle from the first study was found about 100 feet off
this north Point Lobos shore.
