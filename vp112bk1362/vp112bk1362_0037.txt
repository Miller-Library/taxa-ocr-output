Figure 7e: Salinity in parts per thousand at the various stations.
Station A is at the treatment plant, Station B at Mission Point,
Station D at the outfall, Station F at 600 feet south of the
outfall, Station H at the north end of Monastery Beach, and
Station I at the northeast corner of Point Lobos. Each point
represents the readings taken with a refractometer on May 28, 1970
at low tide.
