Figure 8a: Ranking of PO, and H,S values plotted against
the various stations.
Ranking was accomplished by giving the station with the
highest test value a ranking of 1, the station with the
second highest test value a ranking of 2, etc. If two
stations had the same test value, they were given the same
rank. Station A is at the treatment plant, Station B at
Mission Point, Station D at the outfall, Station H at the
north end of Monastery Beach, and Station I at the northeast
corner of Point Lobos.
- - - — phosphate test
— — — hydrogen sulfide test

Figure 8c: Ranking of Cl, and salinity values plotted against
the various stations.
Ranking was accomplished by giving the station with the
highest test value a ranking of 1, the station with the
second highest test value a rankin of 2, etc. If two
stations had the same test value, they were given the same
rank. Station A is at the treatment plant, Station B at
Mission Point, Station D at the outfall, Station H at the
north end of Monastery Beach, and Station I at the northeast
