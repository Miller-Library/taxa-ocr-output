ACKNOWLEDGEMEN
I would like to thank Mr. Rich, superintendent of Point
Lobos State Reserve, for access to that area, Mr. Mehlert
of the California State Department of Parks and Recreation
for the map of the Carmel Bay area, and Hal Stibbs for his
help in identifying tunicate species. I would also like to
express my gratitude to Dr. Welton Lee for his help, advice,
