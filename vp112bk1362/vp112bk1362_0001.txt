INTRODUCTION
Carmel, a city of 4712 inhabitants, is located on the
California coast approximately 120 miles south of San Francisco.
The city discharges 1.1 to 1.3 million gallons a day of primary
treated effluent from an ocean outfall into that part of Carmel
Bay bounded to the north by the Carmel River and to the south
by Monastery Beach. The pipe that carries the sewage from
the Carmel treatment plant to the bay is over 2000 feet in
length, and emerges immediately subtidal in a rocky intertidal
area that receives moderately heavy surf at high tide.
The research reported herein deals with the distribution
and abundance of marine intertidal fauna in the Carmel outfall
area and was chosen due to the need for knowledge concerning
the effect of primary sewage effluent on intertidal organisms.
Recent municipal proposals to change existing conditions by
either extending the outfall pipe farther out into the bay or
developing a secondary treatment plant made this project even
more essential in that comparisons might be drawn in the future
against a baseline of present conditions. In addition, the
Carmel treatment plant has recently begun a program of heavy
chlorination of their sewage, and plans have been formulated
to increase the flow yolume of this waste by adding the effluent
from the Pebble Beach community. Present conditions of the
intertidal animal life around the outfall must now be known
to calculate the probable effects of these changes, and to
help determine the most advisable future course of action for
sewage treatment for this growing coastal community.
Reports in the literature have dealt with the effects of
sewage outfalls on deep water marine environments (e.g. Reish, 1959).
