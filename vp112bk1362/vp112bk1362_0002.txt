Bay area of California in 1956. In addition, these same topics
have been discussed at various symposiums including those held
at the University of California at Berkeley in 1969, and in
Washington, D. C. in 1966. However, little has been done
researching the effects of sewage outfalls on the distribution
of intertidal animals. Virtually nothing has been done in the
Carmel area. The research on the Carmel outfall reported in
this paper will therefore be concerned with intertidal faunal
distribution and abundance as a possible parameter for measuring
sewage pollution.
The research first involved mapping the survey area in
Carmel Bay, as well as the currents affecting the outfall
region. Knowledge of current movements was then used to
determine locations where chemical analyses of the water would
provide more detailed information concerning the dilution of
the effluent and its area of influence. This in turn determined
where transects would be laid so as to best calculate the
distribution and abundance of the fauna. As a result of the
foregoing research, a test organism apparently affected by the
effluent was selected, and its mortality rate in varying
concentrations of sewage was tested.

Mapping the Study Ares
A map of the coastline from Mission Point to Point Lobos,
a state park reserve (Figure 1), was obtained from the California Dept.
of Parks and Recreation, and shows the general study area in
Carmel Bay, California. In addition, the area immediately
adjacent to the outfall, an area approximately 325 feet by
150 feet is shown in Figure 2.
