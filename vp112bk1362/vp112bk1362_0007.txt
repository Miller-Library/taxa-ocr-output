the evidence of strong southward currents. Figure 5 indicates
the movement of fluorescein dye laid as packets near the mouth
of the outfall at low and high tide on May 11, 1970. It was
quite noticeable that part of the effluent moved only 100 feet
north before joining the main movement of water southward.
There is also a heavy wash of effluent directly behind the
outfall which moves to the southern end of the rocks of the
outfall area, a distance of about 600 feet.
From these current studies it appears that for this period
the effluent was moving in a southerly direction towards
Monastery Beach, and because of circular patterns at that point,
the effluent may linger in this area. The drift bottles were
set about 1000 feet offshore so anything plaeed in the water
up to this distance would probably move in a similar pattern.
Chemical Ana
ses
The locations where chemical tests were undertaken are
indicated in Figure 6. These stations were selected as a
result of the current studies with Stations D and F expected
to show the greatest amount of effluent contact. Stations C
and E were expected to show less sewage pollution than the
above stations. Station B at Mission Point approximately
2000 feet north of the outfall was believed to be comparable
to Station H at the north end of Monastery Beach approximately
2000 feet south of the outfall.
The results of the chemical tests are graphed in Figures
7a-7h. Note that the curves are similar in frequently reaching
maximum values at specific stations for H,S, PO, NO., Cl,, and
temperature. The 0,, salinity, and NO tests show the exact
inverse pattern where collectively their minimum values are
often reached at specific stations. This correlation was
clarified by ranking the values obtained, giving the station
with the highest value for a chemical test a ranking of 1, the
