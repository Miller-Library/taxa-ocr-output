ype II - 43.0 to 44.0 feet, horizontal, direct sun,
Area T
inshore, medium amount of plant cover.
Area Type III - 13.0 to 44.0 feet, horizontal, direct sun,
standing water, 20-40 feet from shore,
heavy plant cover.
Area Type IV-
12.0 to 43.0 feet, vertical, inshore,
facing wave action.
Area Type V -
+2.0 to 13.0 feet, vertical, 10-20 feet
farther out from shore than Area Type IV
protected from much of the wave action.
Five quarter meter squares were placed along each of the eight
transects at points which had characteristics similar to those
outlined above. All the macroscopic fauna observable within
each of the squares was counted with the aid of a hand counter.
Diversity indices were later computed on a Wang calculator by
following the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener formulae as outlined
by Cox, 1967.
Limpet Toxicity
The limpets Acmaea digitalis and A. scutum were arrarentl;
affected by the effluent, and so were chosen for toxicity tests.
To minimize variability due to size, tidal height, and location,
160 individuals were all collected at Mission Point at the same
tidal heigth of 43.0 to + 4.0 feet for A. digitalis and from
0.O to 41.0 feet for A. scutum. All the individuals taken
were 1 to 2 cm in length. Ten limpets of each species were
placed in a series of shallow plastic dishes filled to the top
with sea water containing 2, 10, 20, 50, and 100% Carmel sewage
Sea water controls were also utilized. Both chlorinated and
unchlorinated sewage for these experiments was collected from
the Carmel treatment plant. The dishes had a barrier placed
around the top edge so that the limpets could not escape the
test solutions. Temperature was kept constant at 14 centigrade
by emmersing the plastic dishes in a cold water bath. The
