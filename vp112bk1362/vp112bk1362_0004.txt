standard mercury-filled centigrade thermometer for temperature
values. Heavy metals were tested using a Perkin-Elmer Model
303 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. All tests except
those for heavy metals were made at 10 stations ranging from
approximately one mile south of the outfall at south Point
Lobos (Station J) and about 4000 feet south of the outfall at
north Point Lobos (Station I) all the way to 2000 feet north
of the outfall at Mission Point (Station B, see Figure 6).
Testing was also carried out at the Carmel treatment plant
itself (StationA). Heavy metals were measured only in the
effluent at the plant. All field testing was accomplished at
the lowest tide on three different days, May 7, 13, and 28
1970. The low tides on those days were -1.2 feet, 0.4 feet,
and 0.2 feet, respectively.
Faunal Distribution
Following the chemical analyses, a qualitative stud
of faunal distribution was accomplished by laying out transect
lines from higher high water (43.0 - 16.0 feet) perpendicular
to the shore 70-130 feet in length to about mean lower low
water (0.0 feet). All organisms that could be seen one foot
to either side of the line were identified. These transects
were taken along the shore at the same locations where chemical
analyses had been made earlier (cf. Figures 6 and 9).
The qualitative results obtained from the transect studies
were later further quantified. To accomplish this, five typical
types of areas were chosen in eight of the transects and sampled
for numbers and kinds of organisms. These eight stations
corresponded to transects 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (cf. Figure 9).
The characteristics of these areas were as follows:
Area Type I - +4.0 to 15.0 feet, horizontal, inshore,
direct sun, splashed at high tide, very
little plant cover.
