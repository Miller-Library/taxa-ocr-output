Current Studies
Current studies were carried out on two different days.
May 11 and May 25, 1970. On each day 12 plastic bottles
that were color coded and filled with fresh water were used
to show current movement. On the first day, the 12 bottles
were placed in a line parallel to the shore from a point
approximately 2000 feet south of the outfall to a point
nearly 500 feet north of the outfall. The bottles were
dropped from a boat about 1000 feet offshore at regular
intervals of 10 seconds along this line and their initial
position in the water was marked with fluorescein dye. On the
second day, the 12 bottles were placed in a line close to where
the previous pattern of bottles had last been sighted. This
line began about 260 feet off from the center of Monastery
Beach and extended well beyond where the first series of bottles
had been located, nearly 5600 feet offshore towards Cypress
Point. These bottles were laid at 15 second intervals and had
fluorescein dye packets attached to them. On both days the
drift bottles were followed for at least two hours, and their
positions were plotted from observation points on the shore.
Inshore currents near the outfall region were studied
with 20 and 40 gram fluorescein dye packets on May 11, 1970.
The visual dispersion of the dye with the currents was recorded
at both low and high tide over a total period of seven hours.
Chemical Analyses
Chemical analyses included tests for phosphates, nitrites,
nitrates, dissolved oxygen, chlorine, and hydrogen sulfide.
The methods used for nutrients, Cl,, and 0, analyses are those
outlined by Strickland and Parsons, 1965. Salinity was measured
with a pocket refractometer calibrated against standard Copenhagen
water. A portable pH meter was used for pH readings, and a
