A. scutum. While the sample sizes were much too small to be
conclusive, toxicity tests on A. digitalis and A. scutum showed
that these two species seemed definitely affected by sewage
concentrations as low as 2% within the relatively short time
of 32 hours. With this knowledge, the concentration of sewage
should be lowered even further in future experiments. Another
clear point from Figures 20-22 is the increased lethality of
the sewage after chlorination in concentrations up to 20%.
Above this level, sewage without chlorination appeared to be
just as lethal. This suggests that chlorine may be lethal to
limpets in the outfall area where sewage concentrations are
well below 20%. A differing rate of death between A. digitalis
and A. scutum was not discernible, and salinity reduction was
not the apparent cause for the high mortality rate.
The manner of death for these limpets may be of some
consequence in designating how the sewage kills these organisms.
The dead limpets in almost all cases had thrust their shells
back to expose their gills, often with enough force to tear
their mantle. Two limpets that were observed to die in 100%
distilled water did not contort in this manner.
It is essential to note that for 2% unchlorinated sewage
concentrations, the LT50 for these limpets was approximately
32 hours. Because these limpets are affected quickly in sewage
of relatively low concentrations, Acmaea may provide an excellent
test organism for future research dealing with the effect of
sewage effluent on intertidal marine organisms. One such possible
experiment may include the placement of rocks with attached
limpets at varying distances from the outfall to thst their
mortality rate within their natural environment.
