described by Ricketts and Calvin (1992) as an upper-intertidal alga present with all wave
exposures while T. funebralis is a mid-intertidal, protected shore snail. Since both of these
species are present in large quantities in Group II, it might represent a blending of the two
Ricketts and Calvin (1992) assemblages.
Group VII of the site clusters (Fig. 8) has a significantly high abundance of both
Hildenbrandia spp. (average percent cover of these sites is 46.2% compared with 12.9% for all
other sites on the transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test) and L. gigantea (average percent cover of
these sites is 1.6% compared with 0.76% for all other sites on the transect, p«0.01, Student’s t-
test). Ricketts and Calvin (1992) state that L. gigantea can be found in both mid and high
intertidal areas with high exposure. If we assume that Hildenbrandia spp. can be found in both
these areas as well, it is possible that this cluster represents the blending of the mid and high
intertidal exposed areas (Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) groups III and V). Other species in the
cluster seem to represent both Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) mid-intertidal exposed species
assemblage (group III) and their high intertidal species assemblage (group IV). N. californica
(also of Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group III) has a significantly high abundance at sites in this
cluster as compared to all other sites on the transect (0.82% for these sites, 0.46% for other sites
on the transect, p«0.02, Student’s t-test). M. scabra (of Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group V)
also has a significantly higher average percent cover in these sites (1.3%) than across the rest of
the transect (0.53%) (p#0.01, Student’s t-test).
The tidal height-exposure model and species distribution
The tidal height-exposure model (Fig. 3) accurately predicts the species assemblages at
most sites along the transect. The protected areas of the transect, at the backs of protected coves
