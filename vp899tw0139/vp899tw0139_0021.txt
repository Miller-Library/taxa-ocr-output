and on surfaces that are protected from wave action, were covered by the upper limits species
assemblage (the same as Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group VI, cluster II of the species clusters,
and cluster VI of the site clusters). The most exposed areas of the transect contained the mid-
intertidal exposed assemblage (the same as Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group III, cluster I of
the species clusters, and cluster IX of the site clusters) as predicted by the model.
Additionally, some overlapping between zones did occur at sites with a medium wave
force. Group II of the site clusters represented both Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) mid-intertidal
protected assemblage (group V) with its high quantities of both E. muricata, and their high-
intertidal assemblage (group IV) with the above average abundance of T. funebralis. This
indicates that the boundaries on the model are not precise.
Additionally, mapping the sites of the fall site clusters shows that there are distinct spatial
patterns to where clusters occur (Fig. 9). Group IX (containing large amount of M.
californianus) occurs on the headlands of the points, while group VI (containing large amounts
of bare rock and Littorina spp.) generally occurs in more protected areas. The gradient of cluster
members from the headlands to the coves is evident, and there does seem to be a gradient of
clusters relative to wave exposure. We also see that despite this gradient in communities, there
are patches of each cluster that occur along the whole transect. There is no smooth east to west
gradient of species; species distribution is dependent on the shape of the shoreline and the
physical factors at each site.
Correlation between physical factors and species in each assemblage
Although theses species assemblages are distinct and we can see patterns of where they
exist relative to wave exposure, it is not wave exposure alone that is driving species’ distribution.
