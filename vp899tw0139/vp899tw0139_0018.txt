intertidal alga. Given that this analysis did not produce a cluster that represented the high
intertidal zone, cluster II of the species clusters is the best fit for E. muricata.
Cluster III represents a combination of the mid-intertidal protected and exposed species
assemblages described by Ricketts and Calvin (1992) (groups IV and III). The cluster includes
T. funebralis, a species in Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group IV, as well as L. limatula and N.
emarginata, which are both in Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group III. It is unknown why L.
limatula and N. emarginata clustered with T. funebralis in cluster III rather than the mid-
intertidal exposed species in cluster I. Also in cluster III are six algae that are not discussed by
Ricketts and Calvin (1992).
The cluster of sites was performed by grouping sites with similar species composition.
For five of the nine clusters the cluster analysis of sites also yielded characteristic species
assemblages. The species assemblage of Cluster IX corresponded well with Ricketts and
Calvin’s (1992) group III. Cluster IX contains significantly large quantities of M. californianus
(average for sites in this cluster is 65.4% cover) as compared to all other sites on the transect
(p50.01, Student’s t-test) as well as large abundances of species that were expected in the mid¬
intertidal exposed community, according to Ricketts and Calvin (1992), such as P. polymerus
(average for sites in this cluster is 1.2% cover, compared to 0.50% cover all other sites along the
transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test) and N. californica (average for sites in this cluster is 0.75%
cover compared to 0.40% cover for the whole transect, p«0.01, Student’s t-test). It also
contained very low abundances of those species that would not be common in the mid-intertidal
exposed community (Chthamalus spp.: 0.15% cover for sites in this cluster, 1.2% cover for all
other sites on transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test; L. scutulata: 0.040% cover for sites in this
cluster, 0.21 % cover for all other sites on transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test; L. keenæ: 0.00046%
