Abstract
Species abundance data from a horizontal transect at Hopkins Marine Station were combined
with data about the physical environment of these sites to study horizontal variation in intertidal
community structure. Cluster analysis validates traditional ecological descriptions of population
structure, in that the statistical clusters of species are similar to those communities described by
marine ecology texts (such as Ricketts and Calvin, 1992). Regression analysis suggests that
some species commonly found together had different physical parameters driving their
distribution. For example, the limpet Lottia gigantea is positively correlated with wave force,
but shows no correlation with maximum temperature, azimuth and site slope angles, or the
presence of crevices in the rocks. In contrast, L. giganteaâ€™s cluster-mate and prey, the encrusting
alga Hildenbrandia spp., has a positive correlation with slope angle, but no correlation with
wave force, azimuth angle, maximum temperature, or presence of crevices. A smooth,
continuous, horizontal gradient of species does not exist along the experimental transect. The
complex shape of the shoreline causes physical parameters at each site to be uncorrelated with
those at neighboring sites and as a result, the horizontal distribution of species at HMS is patchy.
Horizontal variation can be attributed both to the expansion and contraction of vertical zones
with variation in wave exposure, as well as community changes caused directly by wave
exposure.
