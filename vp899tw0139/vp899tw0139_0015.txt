species abundance and physical factors are shown in Table 1. Wave force was the most
significant physical factor, contributing significantly to 15 out of the 55 total species. Nine
species (articulated coralline algae, B. glandula, Callithamnion paschal, Cryptopleura
lobuliferam, L. gigantea, L. pelta, M. californianus, N. californica and P. polymerus) showed
significant positive trends with wave force. Six species exhibited a significant negative trend
with wave force: crustose corallines, Cumagloia andersonii, L. limatula, L. scutulata, M.
papillatus, Porphyra spp., and T. funebralis.
Six algae (crustose and articulated corallines, C. columbiana, Gelidium coulteri,
Mazzaella affine, and Porphyra spp.) showed a significant positive correlation with azimuth
angle, (or more prominence of the species on northern-facing rocks). The species that showed a
significant negative trend with azimuth angle (meaning more south-facing) were Littorina keenæe,
L. digitalis, and Verrucaria spp.
Verrucaria spp. and Hildenbrandia spp. were the only species that had a positive
correlation with slope angle, while A. xanthogrammica, E. muricata, M. californianus, N.
emarginata, and T. funebralis showed significant negative correlations with slope.
Temperature also was found to be important in determining the distribution of species.
Six algae, Analipus japonicus, articulated corallines, C. andersonii, E. muricata, Mazzaela
leptorhynchus, and Petrocelis spp. showed a significant trend with temperature. Most of the
algae were negatively correlated with temperature; E. muricata was the only alga to have a
positive correlation. R* values range from 0.038 for A. japonicus to 0.248 for E. muricata. L.
pelta, (R°= 0.066, ß = 0.086, p = 0.012), was the only animal species that had a significant trend
with temperature. However, the low r-squared value shows that this trend does not explain much
of the species' distribution.
