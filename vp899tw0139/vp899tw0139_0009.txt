into groups based values in the similarity matrix. Again, many methods of creating these
linkages are available.
Different types of similarity and linkage calculations generally result in different cluster
diagrams. Similarity calculations affect the matrix representing the data, and thus can affect the
cluster groupings (Milligan, 1996). Some different similarity metrics include the Pearson
correlation coefficient, and indices of distance, such as the Euclidean method or the City-block
distance. Pearsonâ€™s correlation metric is a measure of the covariance in pairwise comparisons
between variables, whereas the Euclidean and City-block metrics are based on an arithmetic
distance formulae and often are strongly influenced by large values in the data (Quinn and
Keough, 2002).
Gordon (1996) describes the effects of different linkage methods on clusters. Complete
linkage, which characterizes each cluster by the furthest member of the group, typically produces
balanced, even dendrograms, where objects in clusters are highly similar to one another. Single
linkage produces clusters that are more distinctly separate from the other groupings but contain
objects that are less similar to one another. Complete linkage tends to produce more clusters
than single linkage methods. Various other types of linkages take a middle road between these
two extremes.
Two different cluster analyses were performed in this project. The first compared
species, regardless of their location along the transect. The comparison was accomplished by
doing a pairwise comparison of species by their abundances along the transect. This yielded a
dendrogram that had clusters of species that occurred together. The second type of analysis
compared sites along the transect to each other. These comparisons were performed by doing
pairwise comparisons of all species abundances for each site. This analysis yielded a
