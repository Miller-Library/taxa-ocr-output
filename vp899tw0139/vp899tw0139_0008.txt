widths and depths). The topographic data were collected during April and May 2003. Some of
the sites on the transect had been removed by storms during winter 2002-2003. Thus, data were
not available for topography at six sites.
Statistical Methods
Cluster analysis can be used as a method of summarizing large data sets by helping to
detect patterns or relationships (Gordon,1999). Clustering has not been as widely used in
biology as other methods of statistical analysis, possibly because it is primarily a descriptive tool.
One drawback of cluster analysis is that it remains difficult to validate clusters, as it is often
possible to produce different clustering patterns from the same data depending on the parameters
used (Arabie and Hubert, 1996). Recently, clustering has been used more frequently in biology
to create phylogenetic trees based on molecular data (Arabie and Hubert, 1996), and this increase
in usage might spur creation of better methods of evaluating cluster validity.
The process of cluster analysis is based on grouping objects in a data set so that the
grouped objects are more similar to objects in their own group than they are to objects in other
groups. Various methods of obtaining clusters exist. Hierarchical clustering, where each group
is entirely contained in the next group higher up in the structure, was used in this study, and will
be the only type of clustering discussed. Further discussion of other methods of classification
can be found in Arabie, Hubert, and De Soete (1996), as well as in Gordon (1999).
Cluster analysis proceeds in two stages. First, measures of similarity (or dissimilarity)
are calculated to obtain a matrix of values representing the relationship between all objects in the
set. Many methods of calculating similarity or â€œdistance" exist. Secondly, objects are joined
