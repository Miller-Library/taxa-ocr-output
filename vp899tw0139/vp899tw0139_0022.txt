Only some of the species in each grouping have a significant correlation with wave exposure, not
all of them. The regressions revealed that some of the species have correlations with other,
unrelated factors, such as presence of cracks or the slope of the rock face.
If anything changes the environment of these assemblages, the assemblages will change.
According to the regression relationships found here, if climate change occurs, as predicted by
many scientists, certain species in an assemblage will respond positively to the temperature
change, others negatively, and still other species in the same grouping might not respond at all.
These reactions could dramatically change the species assemblages in each area. Since the algae
appear to be more sensitive to temperature than the invertebrates, they will be more susceptible
to undergoing population-wide geographical distribution shifts as a result of climate change.
Conclusion
The cluster and regression analyses revealed many instances of organisms whose
distribution patterns could reasonably be explained by the physical factors with which they had
significant correlations. Cluster analysis produces a practical, objective method of dividing the
species found on our horizontal transect into distinct assemblages. A model used to predict
species assemblage at a given tidal height and wave exposure was found to correctly determine
species assemblages with my analyses. Further study of intertidal species distribution should be
conducted to better understand cause of species groupings.
