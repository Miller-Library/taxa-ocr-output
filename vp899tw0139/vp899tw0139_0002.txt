Introduction
One of the most easily observable ecological features of rocky shores is the pattern of
zonation that occurs in the intertidal zone. Horizontal bands of distinct communities exist from
high on the shore to subtidal areas (Stephenson and Stephenson, 1949). Causes of vertical
zonation patterns are generally well understood by marine ecologists. The upper limits of
organisms are often set by physical factors, such as threat of desiccation (Carefoot 1977). Lower
limits are generally set by biological factors, such as competition or predation (Carefoot 1977).
In addition to vertical zones, and less easily observed, are horizontal zones of
communities. Causes of horizontal zonation, however, are less known, and much less studied.
Ricketts and Calvin (1992) and Burrows et al (1954) point to exposure to wave action as a cause
for a variation in community structure horizontally along a shore.
Ricketts and Calvin (1992) identify six types of communities, divided both horizontally
and vertically, that exist on rocky intertidal shores (Fig. 1). They focus mainly on invertebrates,
thus some of these groups donâ€™t include all the algae that are commonly found in these
communities. Group I, characteristic of low intertidal, highly wave-exposed areas, is
distinguished by large amounts of algae, particularly corallines, laminarians, and the sea palm,
Postelsia palmaeformis. On especially wave-exposed headlands, the sea urchin,
Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus also occurs in this zone. In the protected, low intertidal areas, a
second community exists (Group II). Characteristic invertebrates that are found in this
community are sea stars, sponges, hydroids, and the large green anemone, Anthopleura
xanthogrammica. The primary alga in this zone is eelgrass, Phyllospadix spp. Further up the
shore is a community, (Group III), dominated by what Ricketts and Calvin (1992) call the
"Mytilus-Pollicipes-Pisaster association." Mytilus californicus, and Pollicipes polymerus, are
