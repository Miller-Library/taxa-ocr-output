combination of the mid-intertidal protected and the high-intertidal communities (Groups IV and
V) was expected.
To test this conceptual model, I first had to verify that groupings of species actually did
exist along the transect. Cluster analyses were used to statistically identify species assemblages.
The analyses, indeed, discerned clusters along the transect. Secondly, I hypothesized that these
clusters would be similar to those described by Ricketts and Calvin (1992). In most cases, there
is in fact a strong similarity between the species assemblages discerned by cluster analyses and
the groupings that Ricketts and Calvin (1992) report. With these verified assemblages in hand, I
then used them to test the tidal height-exposure model. Finally, if the model correctly predicts
how species are distributed in the intertidal zone, and community composition can be predicted
by wave exposure, does that mean that all species in a grouping are correlated with wave
exposure? Regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between species, clusters,
and various physical factors. These analyses, combined with the cluster analyses, suggest that
within clusters, different environmental factors are driving species distribution.

Fieldwork
The transect is located along the Hopkins Marine Station shoreline in Pacific Grove,
California (Fig. 4). The length of shoreline studied is approximately 325 m, with 221
measurement sites. All points along the transect are 1.5 m + 0.3 m above mean lower low water.
Sites are situated at various spacings along the shoreline. Starting at the east end of the transect
46, sites are spaced approximately four meters apart. The next 46 points are approximately two
meters apart; the next 97 points are approximately one half meter apart; the final 29 points are
