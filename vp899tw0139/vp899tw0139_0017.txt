The second type of cluster analysis, of sites by species abundance, contained some
clusters that seemed valid, as well as some clusters that seemed less valid. In terms of moat
distance, these clusters appeared less distinct from one another. Moat distances crossed to create
the clusters are around 0.1 to 0.15 for most of the clusters, out of the total dendrogram distance
of 1.2. However, despite the smaller moat distances, five of the clusters contained species
abundances that created fairly obvious distinctions between clusters. The clusters that were not
deemed significant (because they did not have any distinguishing feature) had unusual species
compositions (such as slightly higher than average abundances of both coralline algae and B.
glandula in cluster VIII).
Statistical clusters versus Ricketts and Calvin's (1992) groups
The clusters of species match the groups described by Ricketts and Calvin (1992) quite
well. M. californianus, T. rubescens, P. polymerus, N. californica, and L. gigantea appear in
both the species cluster I and Ricketts and Calvin’s group III. Species in the cluster group that
diverge from Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group III include L. pelta (Ricketts and Calvin’s
(1992) group V), articulated and crustose corallines (Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group 1), B.
glandula (Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) group V), and M. scabra (Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992)
group V). Grouping the corallines in this cluster makes sense, as the mid-intertidal exposed
grouping is the next closest group to the low intertidal exposed group, where the corallines
occur, according to Ricketts and Calvin (1992).
Cluster II in the species clusters is very well correlated with Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992)
group VI. L. digitalis, Chthamalus spp., L. scutulata, and L. keenæ are species found in both.
Additionally, this cluster includes E. muricata, which Ricketts and Calvin denote as a high
