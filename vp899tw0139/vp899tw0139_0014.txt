E. muricata and T. funebralis characterize the population in cluster II. It is found even
fürther back from the headlands than cluster VII. Sites in cluster II have a medium wave force,
but the average maximum temperature at these sites is the highest of all the groups (33.8 °C).
The sites also average a westerly azimuth angle, 263 degrees.
Sites in cluster VI are characterized by a significantly large quantity of bare rock (average
percentage of quadrat space at these sites that is bare rock is 58.9%) compared to all other sites
along the transect (p20.01, Student’s t-test). The organisms at these sites are littorines,
Chthamalus spp., L. digitalis, and Verrucaria spp., in significantly higher abundance at sites in
this cluster than all other sites along the transect (p#0.01, Student’s t-test). Sites in this cluster
are in some of the most protected areas of the transect (average wave force at these sites is 26.9
N), either because they don’t face oncoming waves or because the site is protected from the
waves by offshore rocks. The average direction that sites in this cluster face is 237 degrees,
southwest.
Also located in the most wave protected areas of the transect is Cluster I. It is comprised
of sites that contain significantly large amounts of M. papillatus (56.2% cover on average at the
sites in this group) as compared to the rest of the transect (p#0.01, Student’s t-test). This cluster
averages the lowest wave force of all the clusters (25.3 N). In the regression analysis, it was
found that M. papillatus was highly negatively correlated with wave force, which is shown again
in this cluster data.
Regressions
The regressions for the most part reinforced previously held notions about which species
corresponded with which physical factors. Data for the multiple regression model relating
