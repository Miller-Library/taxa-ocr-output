Acknowledgements
First and foremost, thanks go to all the members of the Denny lab past and present who
thanklessly collected the species abundance data for this project. Without their input of time,
this project never would have happened. Special thanks also go to my advisor, Mark Denny, for
the inspiration and creativity behind this project. Not only did he give me tremendous amounts
of input, he patiently helped me through the writing process by editing this paper countless times
and offering ideas. Secondly, my thanks go to Chris Harley for his immeasurable amounts of
intertidal zone knowledge, daily input of ideas, and amusing conversations. Also, thanks to Jim
Watanabe who helped with all the statistics in this project. Thank you to Luke Miller, who
accompanied me on various field expeditions and gave me encouragement. Finally, thanks go to
all the 175H professors and students for promoting the curiosity necessary for all research
endeavors.
