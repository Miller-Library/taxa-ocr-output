Cracks and crevices in the rocks were significant positive factors in influencing the
distribution of crustose corallines, N. emarginata, P. polymerus, R. pacifica, and T. funebralis, as
well as worm tubes, which were included in the study as a species. L. digitalis showed a
significant negative relationship with the presence of crack and crevices.
Of the 55 species examined, 22 species showed no significant correlations with any of the
physical factors. Of these 22, 16 were considered rare species, found in five percent or fewer of
the total quadrats along the transect.
Discussion
Are there statistical clusters in the data?
Cluster analysis provided a useful method of grouping species and sites along the
transect. The dendrogram for the first cluster analysis, of species, appears to be an accurate
representation of the species assemblages that are actually seen in the intertidal zone. The moat
distance for these species clusters is large (20.5 for each of the branches out of the total distance
of 2.5 for the entire cluster diagram), suggesting that the three clusters are quite distinct.
In addition to being distinct, the clustering makes ecological sense. In each of the three
species clusters, there are smaller groupings that are indicative of intertidal zone relationships.
For example, in cluster I, L. gigantea and Hildenbrandia spp. join together before joining any
other group. It is possible that the closeness of these two species in the cluster diagram is a result
of the their relationship in the intertidal zone. Limpets have been shown to "garden" algae,
removing all competing organisms so that one alga can grow (Shanks, 2001; Williams and Little,
2001). It has been hypothesized that L. gigantea has this relationship with the encrusting alga
Hildenbrandia spp.
