test; and E. muricata: 1.5% cover for sites in this cluster, 13.2% cover for all other sites on
transect, p#0.01, Student's t-test)
Likewise, Cluster VI was a good match with Ricketts and Calvin’s (1992) upper limits
assemblage, group VI. Cluster VI, which contained large quantities of bare rock (average 58.9%
cover for sites in this cluster versus 20.5% for all other sites on the transect, p«0.01, Student’s t-
test), also contained above average quantities of L. scutulata (average percent cover on sites in
this cluster is 0.37% versus 0.11% cover for all other sites on the transect, p«0.01, Student’s t-
test), L. keenæ (average for sites in this cluster is 0.029% versus 0.0047 % cover for all other
sites on the transect, p20.01, Student’s t-test), Chthamalus spp. (average 2.2% cover in these
sites, and 0.55% cover for all other sites on the transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test) and L. digitalis
(average 1.2% cover in these sites and 0.23% cover for all other sites on the transect, p«0.01,
Student’s t-test), but contained little M. californianus (average1.6% cover in these sites, 23.8%
cover for all other sites on the transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test) or coralline algae (average 1.1%
cover in these sites and 6.4% cover in all other sites on the transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test).
The species assemblage represented in Cluster I of the site clusters is characterized by
large amounts of M. papillatus (average percent cover in these sites is 56.2% compared to 2.4%
for all other sites on the transect, p#0.01, Student’s t-test), which Ricketts and Calvin (1992) do
not discus.
Cluster II of the site clusters contained significantly large quantities of E. muricata
(average percent cover for sites in this cluster is 53.7%, versus 5.8% cover for all other sites on
the transect) and T. funebralis (average for sites in this cluster is 0.24% cover while average for
all other sites on the transect is 0.073% cover) (p#0.01, Student’s t-test). E. muricata is
