distance at which it is combined with another cluster (Fig. 5). Clusters can be identified by
drawing a line down the dendrogram at a specified distance from the origin, crossing various
cluster branches. Each branch that is crossed denotes a cluster (Fig. 6). Branches that are
crossed that have only a single object attached (one site) are outliers. When choosing where to
place my cluster denotation line, I wanted to obtain sizable clusters that were very general
groupings, but still maximize the distance of the moats that 1 was crossing.
All cluster analyses in this project were undertaken using SYSTATâ€™s cluster analysis
module.
Additionally, this project used multiple regression analysis to quantify the relationship
between physical factors and the biological diversity at each site. To obtain unbiased residuals
when conducting the correlations, biological data were transformed using the arcsine-square-root
transformation and physical data were transformed using a log transformation. The model used
for all regressions was:
Species abundance = constant + azimuth angle + slope angle + wave force + temperature + crevice index
Azimuth and slope angles were measured in degrees. Azimuth angle was transformed to
cosine of degrees so that a value of 1 represented due north and -1 due south. Slope angle was
transformed to sine of degrees so that a value of 1 represented a perfectly vertical site, and -1
represented a perfectly horizontal site. Wave force was measured in Newtons. Temperature was
measured in degrees Celsius.

Cluster Analyses
The first type of cluster analysis performed was on species, regardless of their location
along the transect. The dendrogram for the species clusters (Fig. 7) shows three distinct clusters,
