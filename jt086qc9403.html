Dear Dr. Barnes:
Enclosed is a manuscript entitled "The Interstitial Meiofaunal Associations
of Two Physically Different Areas of a Monterey Bay Sandy Beach," which
1 would like to submit for possible publication in the Journal of Experimental
Marine Biology and Ecology. I hope that you find everything in good order,
The large margin of variation reported "Statistical Accuracy" may at first
glance, seem to invalidate the study. However, the margin of variation
does not undermine any of the conclusions of the study. To my knowledge,
the method for checking extration inefficiencies has not been described
before. Furthermore, detailed statistical analyses have been regrettably
rare in meiofaunal population surveys,
I hope that you find the paper worthy of publication. If you should need
further information, I can be reached at the address below.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration,
Sincerely yours,

Abstract
Counts made from core samples of interstitial meiofauna, taken
two weeks apart, at high and low tide each time, on exposed and
protected transects of a long beach, indicate that on both transects
the meiofauna maintained stable ranges and associations. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Meiofauna : Exact'>Meiofauna</span>
of both transects included oligochaetes and collembolids on the high
beach, harpacticoid copepods on the midbeach, archiannelids on the low
beach, and nematodes and turbellarians at all levels. The exposed
transect also contained ostracods (midbeach) and nereid polychaetes
(low beach). Nematodes predominated numerically at all except the
highest and lowest sampling sites. Within their broad ranges the
meiofauna were patchily distributed.
On the protected transect, each site contained about an equal number
of meiofauna. On the exposed beach, meiofauna were most abundant
at mean high water. Overall meiofaunal distribution correlated neither
with macrofaunal distribution, nor with zones of stress associated with
surf or tidal action. This, and their patchy microdistribution, suggest
that meiofauna may be distributed according to microhabitat differences
as much as by macroscopic influences.
Introduction
Meiofauna, usually defined as organisms larger than protozoa but
less than one mm long in their adult stage, are the most numerous multi¬
celled organisms in the sandy beach ecosystem. Despite their abundance,
easy availability, and obvious ecological importance, they are little¬
studied (Pennak, 1950; Swedmark, 1964; Mclntyre, 1969; Hulings, 1971;
Hulings & Gray, 1971). Only a few researchers have undertaken field
surveys of sandy beach meiofauna. No studies have been made on the
open coast of the western Pacific, although Wieser (1959a, 1959b) has
studied the meiofauna of beaches along Puget Sound, Washington,
This study was undertaken to provide a further understanding of
sandy beach meiofauna of the western Pacific coast. It was also
designed to provide some insights into the sandy beach ecosystem in
general, and the role of physical influences in shaping that ecosystem,
Method and Materials
Selection of sampling sites. The Monterey Bay coastline between
Monterey and Fort Ord is ideal for such a study. It is a long, unbroken
sandy beach stretching north for several kilometers from Monterey Harbor
Municipal Wharf +2. As the beach extends to the north, it becomes more
exposed to the open ocean and therefore offers an environment with
unbroken gradients of wave action (Bascom, 1964), sand grain size and
sortment, and organic carbon content (Anderson, Miller, Rabone & Wiggin,1972).
To maximize the physical differences between the beach areas
studied, I chose transects at the extreme ends of the gradients mentioned
above. One site, the Del Monte transect, was 250 m north of Wharf +2
and seemed to have little wave action, relatively fine sand, and a gentle,
even slope. The Sand City transect, 4.6 km north of the Del Monte
transect, had much rougher surf, coarser sand, and a steeper slope.
Sampling procedure. Stations were designated every 9-12 m between
the berm and MLLW (mean lower low water). The Del Monte transect
had five stations, at 2.42, 1.85, 1.23, .58, and .02 m above MLLW,
At the Sand City transect, where the rough surf precluded working too
close to the waves, there were only four stations, at 3.49, 2.37, 1.55,
and .88 m above MLLW. Stations are denoted by their height above MLLW,
Two sets of samples (56 samples in all) were taken. During the
preliminary survey (April 25-27, 1972), a single sample was taken
from each station during the daytime low tide, and another during the
daytime high tide. During the final survey (May 9-10, 1972), triplicate
sets of samples were taken from each station during the daytime high
and low tides. No samples were taken from stations inundated during
high tide.
Physical measurements. For each transect, slope, sand particle
size and sortment, interstitial water content, and interstitial salinity
were measured. I am indebted to Anderson, Miller, Rabone, and Wiggin
(1972), who gathered this data as part of their concurrent study of the
same transects.
Slope was calculated with a line and level. Sand particle size
was obtained by dry sifting through a series of Standard Tyler screens
with mesh sizes of 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.063 mm.
Samples from high, middle, and low beach were sifted. Median particle
diameter and sortment were calculated following the methods of Buchanan
and Kain (1971).
Interstitial water content was estimated by weight loss after drying
to a constant weight. Samples were taken from 15 cm below the surface,
at seven points on each transect.
Permeability was measured with a constant head permeability device,
using sand cores from tidal heights of about 0, 0.6, and 1.8 meters
(Means and Parcher, 1971).
Interstitial organic carbon content was determined by the wet ashing
technique of Strickland and Parsons (1968). Triplicate samples were
taken from four points, about 18 m apart, on each transect,
At the same four points, at the surface and 15 cm below the surface.
interstitial salinity was measured, using an AO refractometer, which
read directly in parts per thousand.
Meiofaunal Sampling Method. Meiofauna samples were taken by
coring to 30 cm with PVC pipe 4 cm in diameter. Each core contained
about 370-380 ml of sand. Each sample was immediately placed in a
beaker, covered, and sealed. Within three hours, the samples were
returned to the laboratory, and placed in a refrigerator at 4°C. They
remained there for 1-21 days, until the meiofauna were extracted. These
procedures did not seem to alter the meiofaunal counts.
Extraction. After the sand sample had been transferred to an
Erlenmeyer flask, a 7.5% solution of MgCl, was added, and the sample
left for at least twenty minutes. Then the sample was swirled, and the
supernatant poured through a 160-u mesh net. Each sample was decanted
at least five times.
After pouring off the MgCl, solution, I added sea water heated to
60°C, which killed most of the remaining meiofauna. The sample was
swirled and decanted another five times.
A fine jet of sea water was used to clean the net contents into a
Petri dish. I inspected the net visually to make sure it was clean.
Filtrates from Del Monte stations .58 and .02 invariably contained
large amounts of organic detritus, and required dilution before counting,
The filtrate was transferred to a graduated cylinder, to which artificial
sea water was added. The column was inverted until the contents were
thoroughly mixed, after which a given fraction was poured off for counting,
Counting. All samples were counted under the low power (10.5x)
of a Bausch & Lomb dissecting microscope. Organisms too small to be
seen at that magnification were not counted. Two counting methods were
used.
During the preliminary survey, I counted eight microscope fields in
each Petri dish. The first took in the center of the dish; the rest were
spaced equally around the center. The fields subsumed eight-fifteenths
of the dish surface.
During the final survey, I placed the dish on a 1-cm grid, and
counted every other whole square, in a checkerboard pattern, Fractions
of squares were ignored. The area counted totalled four-tenths of the
dish.
To obtain the estimate for a whole sample, I multiplied the raw
counts of the MgCl, and sea water subsamples by appropriate factors,
and added the two subtotals.
Statistical Accuracy
The study contained three potentially significant sources of error:
inefficiencies in extraction; counting error; and random sampling varia¬
tion.
To check whether the extraction method left significant numbers of
meiofauna in the sand sample, I counted each rinse separately for three
series of ten rinses. In each series, the tenth rinse vielded only
2.5-3% of the total for all ten samples, indicating that most of the
meiofauna had been extragted.
As a further check, each series of counts was graphed in a decreasing
function. By converting the counts to log,, and using least-squares
regression analysis (Snedecor, 1967), I found the exponential curve
most nearly fitting the points. Calculation at the areas under the three
curves showed that the ten rinses captured an estimated 87, 95, and
96 percent of the animals that the methods would ever catch. Compared
with the large counting error and random sample variation, extraction
inefficiency was an insignificant source of error.
To assess counting error, I counted the contents of four Petri dishes,
randomly chosen in my absence from 22 previously counted. I later
learned which dishes I had recounted, and calculated the pergent
difference of the second count from the first, both for each type of
organism, and for the sample total. I then took the mean and the
standard deviation for each set of percentages.
Meiofaunal Associations
Del Monte Transect. Seven major groups of meiofauna appeared in
the Del Monte transect samples: oligochaetes, collembolids, juveniles of the
polychaete <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Euzonus dillonensis : Exact'>Euzonus dillonensis</span> (Hartman)*, turbellarians, harpacticoid cope¬
pods, nematodes, and archiannelids. Figure 1 shows the abundance and
distribution of each. Nemerteans and mites appeared in insignificant
numbers ((10 per sample).
Nematodes and turbellarians were found at all stations; nematodes
were always abundant. The other meiofaunal types appeared only at one
station each, resulting in specific associations for each tidal level
sampled (Fig. 2). In addition to the nematodes and turbellarians,
oligochaetes and collembolids occurred at station 2.42; juvenile
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Euzonus : Exact'>Euzonus</span> at station 1.85; harpacticoids at station 1.23; and archiannelids
at station .02. Station .58 contained only nematodes and turbellarians.
During the study period, the meiofauna maintained constant ranges.
Their numbers varied both between surveys and among the triplicate samples.
There was a weak tendency for meiofauna to be more numerous in samples
taken during high tide. When compared at similar tidal times, samples
from the different sites contained similar numbers of meiofauna (Fig, 2).
The Euzonus are of meiofaunal size only as juveniles. The adults are
4-5 mm long. The juveniles were found in the same area in which
Anderson, et al., found adults.
The overall counting error for specific types was 22%+11%. The
error for overall totals was 21%+10%. Thus, at worst, the counts were
reliable to within one-third of the reported figure.
To assess expected sample variation, I took the mean and the
standard deviation for each type of organism (N915) and for overall totals,
for each triplicate set of samples. I expressed the deviations as
percentages of the means, and found the mean and standard deviation
of the percentages. In these samples, variation for individual types
was 31%+21%. Overall totals varied by 21%+14%.
Hypothetically, the two errors could be cumulative; the reported
figures would then vary by as much as 80% from the actual population
figures. Because of the large margin of possible error the conclusions
drawn from the data depend on both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
Physical Characteristics of the Transects
The Del Monte and Sand City transects lie at the ends of a series of
six transects studied by Anderson, et al. (1972). The Del Monte transect
is sheltered from the open ocean surf; the Sand City transect is unprotected.
Table I summarizes the data obtained by Anderson, et al. Figures 1 and 3
show profiles of the transects.
The Del Monte transect was even and gently-sloping (5.9%), with
medium-size sand (mean diameter = 400u), well-sorted (6-quartile
deviation = .21) along the entire transect. A distinct black sulfide layer
appeared at stations .58 and .05, about 15 cm below the surface (Gherini
& Swanson, 1972). Mean organic carbon content was 410+98 ug C/gm
dry sand. The data suggest a gradient from the high beach (386 ug) to
the low beach (481 ug). Interstitial water content remained low (6.8%
H,O/gm dry sand) until approximately mean higher high water (MHHW)
below mean lower high water (MLHW) they averaged 24.0%.
The Sand City beach was quite different. It had an obvious berm, a
steeper slope (7.5%), and very coarse sand (mean diameter = 1580 u),
which was not as well sorted (ø-quartile deviation =.4-.5). Organic
carbon content was significantly lower than at the Del Monte transect
(202 ug; t = 7.18 for 2 d.f.). It did not vary greatly between the high beach
(203 ug) and the low beach (200 ug). Interstitial water content followed
a pattern similar to that of Del Monte. Levels were low (3.9%) above
MHHW; below MLHW, it averaged 20%.
Permeability tests suggested that Sand City transect was more permeable
than Del Monte transect. However, inconsistent results at intermediate
transects implied that the method (which involved repacking sand cores in
the lab) may have given inaccurate results.
Salinity ranged between 3.2-3.4% at all levels on both beaches.
The physical differences between the transects have significant
implications for the meiofaunal inhabitants of the interstitial environment.
The most important of these are:
1. Heavy wave action increases the rate of sand turnover, and,
potentially, the rate of meiofaunal depopulation through
physical disturbance.
2. Large sand particles increase the size of interstitial pores,
which increases the life-space available to meiofauna, and
the rates at which water and detritus can flow through the sand.
3. Small sand particles decrease the size of interstitial pores,
thereby decreasing meiofaunal life-space, and the rates of
water and detrital percolation.
4. Organic carbon, a gross index of the meiofaunal food supply,
was irregularly distributed.
5.
High concentrations of organic carbon, which are encouraged by light
surf and small sand particle size, favor black sulfide layer
formation (Gherini & Swanson, 1972). In their concurrent study
of the Del Monte transect, Gheriniand Swanson found that the
diversity and abundance of meiofauna in the sand above the
layer greatly exceeds that in the black-sulfide layer.
Sand City Transect. Sand City transect contained eight major types
of meiofauna: collembolids, oligochaetes, turbellarians, harpacticoids,
ostracods, nematodes, archiannelids, and nereid polychaetes. Figure 3
shows the abundance and distribution of each. Mites and nemerteans
occurred in insignificant numbers (10 per sample).
The associations at the different sites showed greater diversity, and
more overlapping of ranges, at Sand City than at Del Monte (Fig, 4). The
three lower sites all contained five or six major types of meiofauna. The
uppermost station contained only three types.
Again, the meiofauna were generally, but not consistently, more
numerous at high tide.
The total numbers of organisms differed consistently from site to site
(Fig. 4). Station 3.49 was the most barren of the entire study. Stations
2.37 and .88 contained intermediate numbers. Station 1.55 vielded
greater numbers of meiofauna than any other station of the study.
The meiofauna were again patchily distributed. One triplicate
set of samples yielded total counts of 3,700, 12,500, and 10.900
organisms. Though the numbers fluctuated widely, the types found at
any one site remained constant.

Discussion
As suggested by Anderson, et al. (1972), transect slope, mean
particle size and sortment, and organic carbon content can be correlated
with relative exposure to heavy surf. Permeability seemed to correlate
with sand particle size and interstitial detrital content.
The Del Monte transect is sheltered from rough surf by Point Pinos
to the west. It has a gentle, even slope, well-sorted medium-size sand,
a high content of organic carbon, and low permeability. A dense black sulfide
layer appears in the lower third of the beach (Gherini & Swanson, 1972).
Sand City is exposed to the open ocean. It has an obvious berm,
intermediately sorted very coarse sand, and a low organic carbon content.
No black sulfide layer is present.
Despite the physical differences between the beaches, the patterns
of meiofaunal distribution on each beach showed some striking similarities.
The two beaches supported the same types of meiofauna, except that no
Euzonus were found at Sand City (see Anderson, et al. 1972), and no
nereids or ostracods appeared at Del Monte.
The ostracods may be excluded from Del Monte by the small
interstitial spaces there; they are the only type whose body is not elongated
and flexible.
The nereids might easily have been missed at Del Monte. The Del
Monte transect seems to have reached only the extreme edge of the
archiannelids 'range, with which nereids were always associated at
Sand City. Even at Sand City, nereids were always sparse.
On both beaches the meiofauna appeared to maintain constant ranges
and associations on a given beach. However, within their ranges, the
meiofauna were patchily distributed.
Usually, but not always, more individuals were found in the samples
taken at the time of high tide.
The different types of meiofauna seemed to inhabit similar tidal
zones on the beaches. Oligochaetes and collembolids appeared in the
high beach; harpacticoids and ostracods at medbeach; and archiannelids
and nereids in the low mbeach. Nematodes occurred at all levels of
the beach. Turbellarians appeared at all stations below 2.5 m.
Nematodes were the most abundant organism in samples from all
but the highest and lowest stations. At the highest station at Del
Monte, oligochaetes and nematodes codominated; at the highest station
at Sand City, nematodes, oligochaetes and collembolids codominated.
At the lowest stations, archiannelids were most numerous at the Sand
City transect, but not at the Del Monte transect.
The two transects were not similar in all respects. The Del Monte
transect sites contained an average of three types of organisms, and
each site contained roughtly similar numbers of individuals. Except
13
14
for nematodes and turbellarians, the groups of organisms found showed
little overlap in their ranges.
In contrast Sand City transect sites showed clear differences in the
total number of individuals found at the different stations, with a distingt
maximum at Station 1.55. Furthermore, all sites except the highest
contained five or six types of organisms, and these, unlike those of
Del Monte beach, showed much overlap in ranges.
These results lead to several hypotheses about the meiofauna of this
beach by Anderson, et al.(1972).
1. The appearance of greater numbers of organisms at times of
high tide may indicate some sort of vertical migration
associated with the tidal cycle.
2. For this two-week period, the meiofauna maintained stable
ranges and spatial associations. These associations may
form a sandy beach meiofaunal community, dominated numerically
by nematodes except at the terrestrial and marine fringes,
where, respectively, oligochaetes and archiannelids become
dominant. The ranges of each may be most directly related
to tidal level and exposure.
3. Within their ranges, the meiofauna were unevenly distributed.
Their distribution may be related to the irregular distribution
of organic carbon noted by Anderson, Miller, Rabone & Wiggin (1972).
4. The maximum abundance at Sand City occurred at mean high
water, in a zone subject twice daily to inundation and heavy
surf. Thus, the stress engendered by extreme and rapid
environmental fluctuations, which seems to be a limiting
factor for the macrofauna of these beaches (Johnson, 1972), is
no inimical to meiofauna.
johnson, in his concurrent study of the same transects, found low
macrofaunal diversity and abundance in the midtidal zone, and maximum
diversity above 2 m and below 1 m tidal height. The only macrofaunal
types found in the midtidal zone were mobile predators.
The distribution of meiofauna neither follows this pattern nor
complements it. At the Del Monte beach, the meiofauna were distributed
evenly along the transect, despite the different zones of environmental
stress and macrofaunal distribution. At the Sand City transect, the
meiofauna were most abundant on either side of the midtidal zone.
That zone is slao within the range of the only predatory macrofaunal
species found on the transect—the glycerid <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hemipodus borealis : Exact'>Hemipodus borealis</span> (Johnson)
The irregular distribution of meiofauna within their general ranges,
and the apparent contradictions between meiofaunal and macrofaunal dis¬
tributions relative to the macroenvironment, both suggest that differences
between microhabitats are perhaps as important as macroscopic influences
in determining meiofaunal distribution. If so, then future studies should
concentrate on these microhabitat differences, rather than on traditional
macrohabitat influences on zonation.

Without much patient and generous help, I could not have even begun
this study. Dr. Welton Lee constantly tempered my enthusiasm with
insight and sense, and edited the entire manuscript. Dr. Donald P. Abbott
offered invaluable assistance with methods and identification, and his
advice was always patiently and graciously given. Dave Anderson, Roy
Miller, Geoff Rabone, and Don Wiggin gathered all of the physical data
about the transects. Fred Johnson simultaneously studied the macrofauna
of the transects. Without their work, this study would have been much less
interesting. Jim Rote, Sam Johnson, and especially Paul Boothe gave me
much assistance with statistics. S. T. Wheeler typed the entire manuscript,
under difficult conditions. To all of them, I wish to express my gratitude
