captured a prey or what prey type it was. The tethered copepods showed no
specific preference for either plankton, algae or nauplii. Any contraction of the
maxillipeds was sporadic and did not occur to a greater extent in any one food
suspension.
found no significant differences of copepod activity between each food
type or between each light type. There was no significant interaction between
food and light (Tables 1 & 2). Gaussia showed the most activity under white light
with no food (Fig. 1). The least amount of dart activity occurred with the brine
shrimp nauplii, regardless of light condition. The greatest average of individuals
on the side per minute occurred under red light and with phytoplankton (Fig. 2).
The side activity under UV light peaked with zooplankton. Under white light, the
average activity remained fairly constant, regardless of food condition. Again,
none of these differences were significant.
When I placed the Gaussia in the glass tubes, they immediately
sank to the bottom and made no attempt to swim unless the tube was disturbed.
After I added each food type, no dart or side activity occurred. The copepods lay
on either their dorsal or ventral surface and continued with the normal rapid
antenna movement. This sinking behavior also occurred when I turned off the
current in the large tanks. With no current, there was no activity under any
combination of food or light.
Discussion
The foraging behavior of the shallow-water calanoid copepods has been
extensively characterized. Koehl and Strickler (1981) investigated the sieve
feeding tactic of the copepods. They scan the water by beating their feeding
appendages, producing a postero-lateral current. The assymetric swinging of the
