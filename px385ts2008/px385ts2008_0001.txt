Abstract
The feeding behavior and prey selection of the deep-water calanoid
copepod Gaussia princeps was observed under three different light wavelengths
and four different food conditions. Both the free-swimming and tethered Gaussia
showed no significant preference for any food type, light wavelength, or
combination of food and light. Two possible foraging strategies and prey types of
Gaussia are suggested. Comparison of the observed foraging strategies of the
Gaussia to the known foraging tactics of the shallow-water calanoid copepods of
similar structure show that Gaussia may be a suspension feeding herbivore or a
cruise and sink feeding omnivore. This conclusion was made on te basis that
the time copepods spend beating their mouthparts is a measure of foraging
strategy.
