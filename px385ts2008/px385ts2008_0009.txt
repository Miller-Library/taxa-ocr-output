above that which Gaussia inhabits. These light wavelengths could imitate their
natural environment. The white light may have had some effect as the least
amount of side behavior consistently occured under this wavelength. If light is
not the factor that regulates preferred depth, Buskey et al. (1989) suggested that
pressure may control the vertical migration of the deep-water copepods.
To understand the foraging tactics and prey selection of the Gaussia to a
greater extent, these calanoid copepods should be viewed in an environment
more like their natural surroundings. The layer they live in not only has different
water movements compared to the shallow-water environment and artificial tank
currents, but is also under greater pressure. In addition, identity and abundance
of the possible prey organisms in Gaussiaâ€™s natural habitat is necessary to fully
determine what they eat. Two possible methods of discovering possible prey of
the Gaussia are analyzing the gut contents of freshly caught Gaussia, and
performing a fecal analysis.
Defining the feeding biology of the mesopelagic calanoid copepod
Gaussia princeps will not only show what types of species inhabit this deep
zone, but will also help to determine the physical characteristics of this zone and
how these species interact with each other and with their environment.

Thank you to Bob North at the Monterey Bay Aquarium for supplying the
Gaussia and equipment for my research.  would also like to thank Professor
Mark Denny for his help with my set-up and with background material, and
Professor Stuart Thompson for the use of his microscope.
would also
especially like to thank Professor Jim Watanabe for his help with research ideas,
background material, statistical analysis, and reviewing my paper.
