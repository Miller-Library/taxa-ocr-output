Materials and Methods
To examine copepod activity with different food and light types, I observed
sixteen Gaussia each in two tanks maintained at 5Â°0 with a current created by
continuous water flowing in a vertical circular pattern. As these crustaceans are
accustomed to low light intensities, even a total absence of light, black sheets of
plastic surrounded the tank, the front panel removable by velcro strips. The
copepods were gently swept around by this current, and the current was
necessary for them to remain suspended.
lused three light types and four food conditions. White light came from
the normal room light, UV light from an overhead light set on top of the
observation tank, and red light from a normal light covered with two layers of red
celophane, also set on top of the tank. I used the white light for a contrast from
the light intensity the Gaussia encounter in their natural habitat and to provide a
comparison to the shallow-water copepod environment. The UV light is absorbed
at depths above that at which Gaussia have been found, and has been observed
to cause the luminous cells in the copepods to fluoresce as well (Bowlby, 1991).
Red light is also absorbed at a depth above that at which the Gaussia live and
so allows the copepods to be observed in an environment closest to their own as
they may be insensitive to this wavelength of light.
The three food types consisted of phytoplankton, brine shrimp nauplii and
natural zooplankton. The phytoplankton (Dunaliella and Nannochloropsis) and
nauplii were obtained from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the zooplankton was
obtained from 10 minute tows done at Hopkins Marine Station. The zooplankton
consisted primarily of shallow-water copepods, radiolaria, diatoms, cladocera,
and chaetognatha. I did not feed theGaussia in one tank more than one food
type per day, and the tank was cleaned regularly.
