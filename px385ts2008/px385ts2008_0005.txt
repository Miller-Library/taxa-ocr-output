no food, phytoplankton, brine shrimp nauplii and zooplankton. For each 10
minute interval I calculated the averages of darts and sides. I conducted
between two and five replicates of each food and light combination. Data were
analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with light source and food type as fixed
factors.
Results
Under the microscope, the Gaussia displayed several different types of
movement patterns. When I kept the water flowing at a steady rate or at a zero
velocity, the tethered Gaussia rapidly moved its antennae to create a current flow
past its maxillipeds in the posterior direction. This pattern could be seen when
added a dense suspension of food to the water. IfI suddenly changed the rate of
water flow, the copepod would either completely stop all movement for a moment
then resume activity with a rapid appendage contraction which included pumping
of the legs and contraction of the maxillipeds and antennules, or immediately
perform the rapid appendage contraction before resuming the antennae
moyement. This movement of the legs and contraction of the maxillipeds and
antennules are how the Gaussia propel themselves through the water, producing
the dart behavior. I also observed this behavior when large pieces of debris
associated with the plankton food suspension became entangled with the
copepod's maxillipeds or antennules. The copepod could also move just the
antennule or maxilliped on which the piece was stuck.
When the copepod contracted its maxillipeds, they moved toward its
mouth. This movement is extremely fast and although the microscopic plankton
and individual nauplii were visible, I could not tell whether the Gaussia had
