Introduction
Gaussia princeps is a calanoid copepod found in the mesopelagic zone.
They have been found between 300 and 1000 meters and are thought to be
vertical migrators (Bob North, pers. comm.). Both the adult male and female
copepods are 9.0-12.0 mm in length. The bioluminescent capabilities of these
crustaceans have been extensively studied, but much of their biology is unknown
(Barnes and Case, 1972; Latz, Bowlby and Case, 1990; Bowlby and Case,
1991).
The diet and foraging behavior of Gaussia has not been described, but
the shallow-water copepod feeding strategies and food preferences have been
widely characterized. The shallow-water calanoids are much smaller than
Gaussia, but their similar features may help elucidate much about the deep-water
copepods. These shallow-water copepods employ several different feeding
strategies and select different prey types. The feeding strategies used by the
shallow-water copepods are influenced by what type of prey they are seeking
and the physical characteristics of their environment, such as light and water
movement. By characterizing and comparing the feeding behavior of the
Gaussia to the shallow-water calanoids, the foraging tactics and possible prey
type of the Gaussia may be determined.
The purpose of this research was to determine what type of prey Gaussia
preferentially feeds on and what methods these deep-water copepods use to
catch their prey.
