the amount of oxygen consumed.
The results from the use of 14C glycerol show that
approximately 108 of the glycerol is oxidized to form 140-co..
However, this figure is known to be inaccurate because the
14C carbonate ions were not driven from the suspension med¬
ium. The number of counts (background counts subtracted)
obtained for 0.2 ml of 14 mMolar glycerol/U-14C glycerol
was 2050 whereas the value for Beta-phenethylamine was 190.
This experiment neither confirms nor denies the assumption
that glycerol is directly metabolized, further experiments
are needed to clarify this.
