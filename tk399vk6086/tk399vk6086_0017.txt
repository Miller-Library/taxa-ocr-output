Glycerol Affects O, Consumption
Graph Captions
1. Relative Depletion -- percentage increase in rate of
oxygen consumption upon addition of an unlimited
amount of glycerol -- plotted against time for sym¬
biotic A. elegantissima.
Cell suspension of symbiotic A. elegantissima after
a 96 hour depletion bath to show the increase in
rate of oxygen consumption upon addition of glycerol
and a return to the endogenous rate after glycerol
utilization. This graph represents an expanded
portion of the whole 10 hour graph. The numbers
at the end of the line segments indicate the 0.5,
1.0 and 1.5 ml samples. The other numbers stand
for the amount of oxygen consumed in l.
