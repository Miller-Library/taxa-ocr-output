Materials and Methods
1. Collection and Maintenance of Specimens
The sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima, containing
symbiotic algae, was collected from the intertidal zone at
Point Joe, Seventeen Mile Drive, Del Monte Forest, California.
Only clonal specimens were obtained. These were maintained
in a sea water aquaria under constant aeration on an approx¬
imate 12h light - 12h dark regime. Experiments were con¬
ducted within four weeks of collection.
2. Tissue Preparation
Three anemones from the same clone were taken for each
experimental run. These were then scissor minced to produce
a whole cell preparation. Verification by microscopic exam¬
ination, revealed that cells of approximately 7 in diameter
were interspersed with unicellular zooxanthellae, of an
average diameter of 12,. The zooxanthellae were observed to
be intercellular. This mince was then suspended with milli¬
pore filtered sea water and allowed to settle for five min¬
utes. Only the supernatant of cells and mucus was used
while the residue was returned to the mince. The whole
process was repeated until a suitable amount of the super¬
natant was obtained; this was then centrifuged and only
the pellet of whole cells was retained.
