This pellet was washed with sea water and centrifuged
repeatedly for a total of three times. In all cases the
residue was recovered and diluted to become the stock solu¬
tion. A bath at 25°C was used to keep the solution agitated
and thus allow a thorough mixture with air. At appropriate
time intervals (48h, 72h, and 96h) the solution was removed,
washed with sea water and centrifuged -- this process was
repeated three times. After dilution, the residue became
the final working solution and upon removing a quantity
suitable for the day's experiment, the solution was then
returned to the bath until the next interval.
All the sea water used in this experiment had been pre¬
viously millipore (0.45) filtered. This filtering removed
any particulate food sources bigger than 0.45p from the med¬
ium. The repeated washings and centrifugation of the cell
suspension eliminated any soluble substances from the lysed
cells, thus removing any food sources which could be added
to the metabolite pool and so be used by the cells. These
washings allowed for a faster depletion rate of the prepara¬
tion.
Samples of 1 ml were withdrawn from the working solu-
tion for the following determinations: 1) protein by the
Lowry Method (Lowry 1951), 2) chlorophyll a and c using an
