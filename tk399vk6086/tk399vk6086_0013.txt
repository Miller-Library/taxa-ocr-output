Glycerol Affects 0, Consumption
this does not suggest whether glycerol has an inductive
effect, as possibly shown by the time lag on the graph, or
whether it is directly metabolized. If it was directly
metabolized, glycerol would require phosphorylation and
oxidation to form dihydroxyacetone dehydrogenase. This
would then be enzymatically converted to glyceraldehyde
phosphate -- a metabolite which can enter the second
stage of glycolysis to produce ATP and indirectly consume
oxygen. Radioactive studies with U-14C glycerol did not
conclusively prove that glycerol was directly metabolized
by a cell preparation of A. elegantissima.
