Glycerol Affects 0, Consumption
Earlier experiments (Muscatine 1974, Taylor 1969) have
shown that symbiotic anemones starved in the dark, lose
weight at a faster rate than those starved in the light.
This implies that the algal's photosynthesis and subsequent
translocation of products to the host is sufficient to aid
the anemones in their nutritional requirements. Thus the
zooxanthellae's relationship with the sea anemones is most
likely one of a nutritional role.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the utili¬
zation of glycerol in symbiotic A. elegantissima on the
basis of oxygen consumption. Since glucose is retained by
the zooxanthellae, it appears reasonable to assume that
glycerol, the only other major carbohydrate produced in the
photosynthate, should also be capable of affecting the rate
of oxygen consumption by the anemone's cells. If this is
correct, it remains to be seen whether glycerol is directly
metabolized or whether it has an inductive effect on a sys¬
tem which increases the amount of oxygen consumed.
