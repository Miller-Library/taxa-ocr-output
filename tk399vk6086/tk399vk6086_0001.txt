Glycerol Affects 0, Consumption
Abstract
Measurements obtained by the direct method of Warburg,
definitely show that glycerol has an effect on the oxygen
consumption of a whole cell preparation of Anthopleura ele¬
gantissima. However, inconclusive evidence from the util¬
ization of U-140 glycerol has not shown whether glycerol is
directly metabolized or inductively used by A. elegantissima
cells. A comparison with other results for a similar investi¬
gation with A. xanthogrammica, shows that whole cell prepara¬
tions of both A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica react
in the same manner to glycerol.
