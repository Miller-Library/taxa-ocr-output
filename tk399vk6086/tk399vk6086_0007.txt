15 min readings. At this point the manometers were reset
and the interval was timed from the end of this process.
4. Utilization of U-14c Glycerol
In order to determine whether the anemone's cells
directly metabolized or inductively used glycerol, it was
necessary to use U-140 glycerol. A 50 C sample was obtained
from Ammersham/Searle. This was diluted with distilled water
until 2 050 counts was obtained, 2 x 10 ml was added to 0.2
ml of 14 mMolar of cold glycerol.
A 72 hour depletion was used and three 1.0 ml samples of
the cell preparation were taken. Beta-phenethylamine (0.07ml)
was used instead of KOH. After completing the experimental
run, the filter paper wick was removed and put into a scintilÂ¬
lation vial. Upon the addition of Aguasol, the vials were
placed into the scintillation counter (Unilux II) and counted
for 1 minute after a 30 minute refrigeration period.
