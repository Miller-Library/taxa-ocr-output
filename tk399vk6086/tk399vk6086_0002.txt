Introduction
Sea anemones may have symbiotic dinoflagellates, termed
zooxanthellae, residing within their tissues. In Anthopleura
elegantissima, the symbionts are confined to the endodermal
layer (Trench 1971a). The amount of zooxanthellae may be
quantifiably measured and identified by the presence of the
chlorophyll pigments a and c, and the carotenoid peridenin
(Strain 1944, Jeffrey 1968).
The benefits which this symbiotic relationship can pro¬
duce are manyfold; however, only some aspects have been
studied. For example, previous studies have shown that the
zooxanthellae can release a substantial portion of soluble
organic products to their host animal. In vivo experiments
conducted by Trench (197la, b) have shown that approximately
508 of the 140 fixed by photosynthesis in the zooxanthellae
is translocated to the tissues of A. elegantissima. The
photosynthate obtained was determined by in vitro and in
vivo studies (Trench 197la, b) to be 140 glycerol, 140 glu¬
cose, 140 alanine and other 140 organic acids. Of these,
radioactive glucose was the major carbohydrate to be retained
by the zooxanthellae, whereas radioactive lipids and proteins
were found to be present in the host's tissues. Deacylation
of the lipid moiety yielded 140 glycerol while hydrolysis of
the protein yielded 140 amino acids.
