Glycerol AffectsO Consumption

consumption obtained before, during, and after glycerol
utilization, the percentage increase of rate, and the amount
of oxygen consumed during this utilization.
The rates obtained in this experiment are approximately
triple the rates found in Table 1 for 96 hours. It is not
known why there is such an increase, future experiments
should clarify this.
As can be seen from Table 2, the rate of utilization of
glycerol increases along with the increasing concentration
of tissue sample. It is interesting to note that the percenÂ¬
tage increase in rate during glycerol utilization increases
by approximately 1003 increments for each concentration and
that the amount of oxygen consumed also increases by 5yl each
time. More experiments are necessary before any further
analysis of these figures is possible.
One aspect which was not expected to occur is the time
lag from the addition of glycerol to the beginning of its
utilization. The lag ranges from 45 minutes for both the
0.5 and 1.5 ml samples to 60 minutes for the 1.0 ml sample.
It would seem that this period is too long to account for
the diffusion of glycerol into the cells. A more suitable
assumption would be that glycerol has an inductive effect.
The time lag would then represent the amount of time required
for the induction to occur and somehow cause an increase in
