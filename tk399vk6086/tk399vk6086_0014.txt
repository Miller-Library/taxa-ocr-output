Glycerol Affects 0, Consumption
I wish to thank Drs. F. Fuhrman and J. Phillips for
their advice on the procedures of this experiment and for
their encouragement, Mrs. G. Fuhrman for her suggestions
on the Warburg vessel "washing technique", Mr. Murphy for
his aid in the use of the radioactive glycerol, and Dr. R.
Burnett for his critical assessment of this paper. Special
thanks go to my Warburg partner, Chuck DiRaimondo, for his
help in making the "Warburg Technique" less of a mystery and
in making this spring quarter more of an enjoyable one.
