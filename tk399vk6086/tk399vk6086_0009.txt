Glycerol Affects O, Consumption
rate, whereas the 96 hour sample has more than twice that
increase. This again suggests that the 96 hour cell sus¬
pension is more devoid of reserves than the 48 and 72 hour
samples. A difference in density of the cell suspension
caused by errors in pipetting could perhaps explain the low
72 hour reading.
2. Quantitative Demonstration
In these experiments, 0.2 ml of 14 mMolar glycerol was
used. From a balanced equation of the oxidations of glycerol
into CO, and H,O, it was calculated that this amount of
glycerol gave slightly more than 20 l of oxygen consumption.
The purpose of having only 20 pl instead of an unlimited
amount of glycerol was to show that the rate of oxygen con¬
sumption returns to its original endogenous value upon the
utilization of the 14 mMolar glycerol.
The actual results from a 96 hour depletion bath show
exactly what was expected. A linear endogenous rate is
observed initially, followed by an increase in rate upon
the addition of glycerol for a certain period of time, and
finally a return to its previous endogenous value. Graph 2
shows the results of this experiment; it should be noted
that this graph only shows the four hour portion of the
whole ten hour graph. Table 2 shows the rates of oxygen
