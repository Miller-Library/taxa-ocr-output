3. Measurement of Oxygen Consumption
The direct method of Warburg (Dixon 1951, Umbreit 1972)
was used for all experiments. The volumes of the Warburg
vessels used, ranged from 11.2 ml to 16.9 ml. Three samples
of cell preparation were obtained from the working solution:
0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ml; these were all brought to a constant
volume of 1.5 ml by the addition of sea water. Two dupli¬
cates were used at each volume. The working solution was
then returned to the depletion bath. In addition to the
above liquid volume, 0.2 ml of 208 KOH solution was added
to a filter paper wick in the vessels' centre well for the
absorption of CO.. Either 0.2 ml of 1 Molar or 0.2 of 14
mMolar glycerol was added to the side arm and used as the
substrate to be tested.
The gas phase was air for all experiments. The vessels
were shaken at a rate of 104/min with a stroke length of 1.5
cm at 25°C. After allowing 30 minutes for thermoequilibra¬
tion, readings were taken on the half hour until a linear
endogenous rate was obtained. Once this was acquired,
readings were taken every 15 minutes for four hours. Glycerol
was added to the main reaction vessel after the first four
