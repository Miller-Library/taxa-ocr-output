Glycerol Affects 0, Consumption
Results and Discussion
The investigation of the utilization of glycerol was
divided into two parts: 1) the qualitative demonstration,
and 2) the quantitative measure of the effects of glycerol.
1. Qualitative Demonstration
For this investigation, 0.2 ml of 1 Molar glycerol was
used in the side arm. The experiment was designed to show
the effects of an unlimited amount of glycerol on the basis
of oxygen consumption, the results, for which, are shown in
Table 1. The percentage increase in the rate of oxygen con¬
sumption after the addition of glycerol may be taken to
measure the amount that the anemone's reserves have been
depleted — it is an index of their depletion as shown in
Graph 1.
As can be seen from Table 1, samples taken at later
intervals show a greater increase in rate after the addition
of glycerol, than do those taken at a lesser interval. This
may be described in terms of depletion: the highest rate of
depletion appears to occur between 48 and 72 hours, while
the rate between 72 and 96 hours is one-half that of the
previous rate. If the change in rate is observed rather
than the percentage increase, it can be seen that the 48
and 72 hour samples have approximately the same increase in
