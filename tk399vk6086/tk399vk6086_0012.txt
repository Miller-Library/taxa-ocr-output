Conclusion
From qualitative experiments, it was determined that a
96 hour depletion bath was a suitable period of time to
devoid a cell preparation of A. elegantissima of most of its
reserves. The depletion became apparent from the observation
of a linear endogenous rate. This result was also obtained
by DiRaimondo (1975) in a similar investigation on A. xantho-
grammica. Comparing the mean endogenous rate of both Antho¬
pleura, it was found that after 96 hours both consumed oxygen
at much the same rate. The rate of oxygen consumption for a
cell suspension of A. elegantissima was 13.8 1/mg protein/h
while that of A. xanthogrammica was 12.8 l/mg protein/h.
After these figures have been standardized for the amount of
zooxanthellae present (measured by the amount of chlorophll
a), they become 3.9 and 4.3 l/mg protein/h/mg chlorophyll a
respectively. Thus from these experiments it appears that
whole cell preparations of A. xanthogrammica and A. elegantis¬
sima respire at nearly identical rates.
Glycerol has an effect on the consumption of oxygen
when measured by the Warburg respirometer on a cell suspen¬
sion of A. elegantissima. This suggests that the glycerol
produced by the zooxanthellae which is translocated to the
host's tissues could also be used in respiration, rather than
just as a subsidiary storage molecule such as lipid. However,
