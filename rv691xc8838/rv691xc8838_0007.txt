moistened only by splash. The height of this region
varies considerably with the amount of exposure to
surf. Littorina scutulata occurs somewhat lower, and
in more protected areas, ranging from about +2 feet up
to about +6 feet in some areas. It is frequently found
in moderate to heavy growths of algae, and smaller individuals
occur in large numbers in some horizontal Balanus beds.
The ranges of the two species of littorines overlap
considerably in some areas.
Both species are known to depend on microscopic
algae (diatoms, greens, and some blue greens) as a
principal food source (Castenholz, 1961; Foster, unpublished),
especially where macroscopic algae is scarce or absent,
as it is over much of the range of L. planaxis. However,

there are areas in which considerable macroscopic algae
is available, and it is with these areas that this study
is primarily concerned. A number of common algae occur
in the vicinity of littorine populations, especially
Cladophora trichotoma (C.A. Agardh) KÃ¼tzing, Endocladia
muricata (Postels and Ruprecht) J.G. Agardh, Fucus
furcatus C.A. Agardh, Gigartina Agardhii Setchell and
Gardner, Gigartina cristata (Setchell) Setchell and
Gardner, Iridophycus flaccidum Setchell and Gardner,
Pelvetia fastigiata (J.G. Agardh) DeToni, Porphyra
perforata J.G. Agardh, Rhodoglossum affine (Harvey)
Cladophora is generally found
Kylin, and Ulva spp.
