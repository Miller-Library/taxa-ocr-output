almost nothing has been published about them up to now,
and while the eastern U.S. and European littorines are
generally better known, information on food and feeding
patterns is very scarce. North (1954) analyzed size
distribution, erosive activities, and gross metabolic
efficiency of both L. planaxis and L. scutulata.
Castenholz (1961) used L. scutulata as well as Acmaea
spp. in his studies of grazing effects on diatom populations.
From his observations, he assumed "that the primary
food of these gastropods is diatom material," with
blue green algae the principal food in the "supra-littoral"
fringe. Ricketts and Calvin (1952) state that L. planaxis
feeds on detritus and microscopic plants scraped from
almost bare rock, and that "certain of the rockweeds
(Pelvetia or Fucus) serve the young periwinkles as a
sort of nursery, for it is on their fronds and stems
that the young will nearly always be found, "(p. 20),
an observation for which no evidence has been seen
during this study. Concerning other species, Newell
(1958) noted that Littorina littorea ate surface deposits
of diatoms and small algae, and also browsed on Ulva
and Enteromorpha.
The answers to three questions were sought in this
study. Can these snails eat macroscopic algae? Which
algae, if any, are normally part of their diet? How
important is macroscopic algae in their diets? A number
