and the others present in lesser quantities. One survey
showed that the first area contained 147 L. planaxis
and 329 L. scutulata. Surveys were generally made in
the morning while the snails were still active from their
previous nights wetting, yet had had enough time to feed
adequately on the algae.
The feeding behavior of Littorina planaxis and
L. scutulata seems to be a combination of random activity
with preferential movement. In the laboratory, snails
are frequently observed scraping their radula along a clean
glass surface, and have been known to consume considerable
quantities of paraffin and powdered carbon. In the field,
the stomach contents of snails have revealed large
qunatities of sand and rock particles, detritus, any
number of algal types, and occasional small animals,
often still alive and active. There seems, therefore,
to be little or no selectivity in what is ingested from
any given surface. However, field studies to be discussed
later suggest that each species has, at least under
some conditions, definite preferences for certain types
of substrates or algae.
The radula of littorines seems capable of tearing
off quite large pieces of substrate material, and particles
of considerable size have been found in the stomachs.
Some of the smaller algae such as the filamentous
Cladophora and the small monostromatous Prasiola meridionalis
