Gigartina cristata, Endocladia, Rhodoglossum, Porphyra,
Ulva, Iridophycus, Laminaria Andersonii), and all
individuals disected had macroscopic algal fragments
ase
in their stomachs (these were identified for Porphyra,
Laminaria, and Ulva).
Concerning the effects of littorine feeding on
macroscopic algae, the situation seems to be similar
to that noted by Castenholz (1961) for the effects of
L. scutulata on diatom populations; the snails are able
to prevent sparse populations from increasing, but do
not have much effect on well established colonies. The
completely bare areas between algal growths in which
littorines are so frequently found (Castenholz, 1961)
are probably kept bare by continual grazing, and the
occasional presence of very young thalli in littorine
stomachs supports this. In the study area near Pescadero
Point, the Pelvetia is worn and indented, and in some
places only the stubby remains of thalli can be found
in the bottom of cracks, too tightly packed for the snails
to reach. Even the Endocladia is undercut and trimmed
back for about 1 cm above the rock surface in some areas
bordering on bare rock. Whether these effects are due to
the feeding activity of littorines is not possible to
say without lengthy observations and measurements, but
considering the quantities of cell material found in
stomachs, the depredations observed intthe laboratory,
