attempt to induce feeding in the laboratory. L. planaxis
has a strong tendency to crawl to the highest part of the
dish or aquarium, especially if placed in water.
Individuals of both species would frequently cease
activity if left undisturbed for more than 6 to 12 hours.
Natural conditions, especially with respect to tidal
and diurnal fluctuations, proved almost imposible to
duplicate, yet it would have been even more difficult
to keep track of individual snails in the field, or to
eliminate unwanted food sources there, especially the
ubiquitous GATGOR (Green Algae That Grows On Rocks, a
term applied to the microscopic flora. Work on this
aspect of littorine feeding has been done by Mr. Michael
Foster). Experimental animals had to be run singly in
experiments where starvation was a factor because of the
N
tendency of snails to feed on each others' backs.
Additional complications resulted from epiphytic algae
growing on the test specimins, and from the rapid decay
of certain types of algae, especially Iridophycus flaccidum
and Laminaria Andersonii, under conditions available
in the laboratory.
A number of criteria were set up by which feeding
on any particular alga could be substantiated with a
reasonable degree of certainty. At least two of these
three standards had to be met before a snail could be
considered to have "fed" on the alga in question. These
