on algal substrates. There were marked preferences
for certain species of algae. Of the 153 snails on
algae, 72 were on Cladophora, 46 on Pelvetia, 20 on
Rhodoglossum, and no more than 5 on any of the other
species. Nor is this entirely a reflection of the
relative abundance of the algae; Endocladia, the most
common, had only 3 L. scutulata on it, and some of the
others had fewer than their relative areas would suggest.
Also, observations under more favorable conditions than
those reflected in the above survey suggest that all
these figures, especially for Pelvetia, are at times
considerably higher. In other areas, L. scutulata is
also found on Fucus and Porphyra. In addition, tidepool
populations of L. scutulata have been observed scavenging
on decaying algae such as Gigartina corymbifera and
Prionitus lanceolata that had been left in the pools
by very high tides. In these particular instances, the
stomachs of snails collected from the algae were stuffed
with partially decomposed algal material.
Laboratory studies confirmed that L. scutulata
will readily eat a variety of macroscopic algae. In
addition to the Cladophora and Pelvetia mentioned above
in which feeding was definitely observed, snails readily
attacked Ulva spp., leaving only tattered shreads. In
the preference tank previously mentioned, L. scutulata
was observed on all algae in the tank (Pelvetia, Cladophora,
