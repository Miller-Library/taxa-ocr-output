area under the same conditions. A number of possible
sources of error need also to be considered and remedied
if possible: in almost all cases the samples were small;
study areas in the field were selected because of the
prevalence of littorines feeding on algae; no attempts
were made in the laboratory to take into account the
previous conditioning of the snails in the field with
regard to food; laboratory conditions were far from
duplicating natural situations (in the most successful
attempt, the spray-doused preference tank, the three
algae on which the least feeding was observed were
Pelvetia, Cladophora, and Porphyra).
In summary, Littorina planaxis generally eats only
microscopic foods and those macroscopic algae small
enough to be consumed entire or nearly so. The reasons
for this are not clear, but may be related to the structure
of the mouth, or the preference for certain types of
substrates. Littorina scutulata is frequently found
eating macroscopic algae, especially Cladophora, Pelvetia,
and other more easily ingested forms. The effects of
this feeding are probably important in limiting the
spread of new plants, and the effects on established
thalli, while possibly considerable in some instances,
appear to vary greatly with the species of algae.
