served as controls. A single freshly-collected L.
planaxis was placed in each dish for 5 hours and then
disected. The snails consumed large quantities of
the chopped pieces whole, and also the GATGOR, while
the stomachs of the control winkles were empty, even
whentthey were attached to the algae. In an algal
preference test run in an aquarium kept damp by spray,
the few L. planaxis that did not crawl to the top of the
tank fed either on rock samples or on soft, decaying
pieces of Iridophycus flaccidum. There

There are several possible reasons why L. planaxis
does not normally eat much macroscopic algae: (a) it is
unable to "bite off" pieces of any but the softest of
most finely divided algae; (b) it for some reason will
not crawl on the "unstable" substrates provided by algae;
(c) most macroscopic algae are somehow chemically
disagreeable to it. Item (c) can be safely discarded,
since L. planaxis showed no aversion to chopped algae.
There is at present no evidence for or against reasons
(a) and (b), although a brief examination of the mouth
and radula showed no obvious differences from those of
L. scutulata, which feeds much more on macroscopic algae.
In contrast with L. planaxis, Littorina scutulata
both encounters more macroscopic algae and eats more of
it. For'instance)oinrthe survey near Pescadero Point
cited above, 47% ofthe L. scutulata in both areas were
