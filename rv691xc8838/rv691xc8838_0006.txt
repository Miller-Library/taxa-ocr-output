were as follows: (a) the snail was observed on the alga,
preferably actively moving, and with the radula active;
(b) whole pieces or fragments of tissue were found in
the stomach or feces exactly matching in cell size,
shape, structure, color, type of chloroplasts, etc.,
scrapings or known forms of the alga in question (usually
determined by direct comparison); (c) the animal was
starved (kept with no signs of feeding or no food) for
at least six hours prior to feeding or disection, and had
stomach contents not dissimilar to fragments of the
test alga.
Most of the observations of feeding on any particular
alga are based on only a small number of individuals
because of the time involved in making a positive
determination of feeding, and, in some cases, because
such feeding itself may occur only rarely. Some algae
are found over only a small part of the range of L.
planaxis or L. scutulata, or snails may feed on them
only under particularly favorable conditions. It was
assumed, however, that positive proof of feeding on an
alga, even if based on only one individual, would indicate
a species capability if not a preference, and that once
such a capability was demonstrated, snails observed on
such an alga were probably feeding on it.
Littorina planaxis is generally found in the upper
regions of the intertidal zone, on "bare" rocks normally
