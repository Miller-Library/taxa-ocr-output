and the number of snails involved, the effects of
feeding are by no means insignificant. However, well
established algal growths seem to be able to hold their
own successfully, at least for short periods. Two
areas, one with Porphyra, the other with Cladophora
and Ulva were caged with fiberglass netting and + inch
mesh galvanized screen into two compartments, one with
25 L. scutulata, the other empty as a control (a third
compartment with 25 L. planaxis was added for the Ulva,
Cladophora test). After two weeks, no effects were
observed that could be directly attributed to the snails,
although measurements were not very accurate. The effects
on different algae probably vary considerably, judging
from the varying quantities of algal material in the
stomachs of snails feeding on different plants. Porphyra
and Rhodoglossum, for example, were generally found in
much smaller quantities than the softer Pelvetia and
decaying algae, or the more easily ingested Cladophora.
This study was of course) limited in its scope
because of the short duration of the observations.
More statistical surveys and field observations on
preferences are needed, covering a larger number of areas;
the effects of littorine feeding on algae should be
measured quantitatively. Much more has yet to be learned
about the mechanisms behind preferences, and the differences
in feeding habits of the two species when in the same
