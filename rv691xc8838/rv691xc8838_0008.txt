in cracks, crevasses, and tidepools, on horizontal
surfaces, sometimes together with Ulva; Endocladia,
Rhodoglossum, and the gigartinas are frequently associated
together in crevasses and on rock surfaces, as well as
in scattered individual clusters; Pelvetia, Fucus, and
lridophycus are commonest on sloping surfaces at slightly
lower levels; Porphyra often covers the tops of boulders
and outcroppings.
One area, in which many of the field observations
included in this study were made, includes all of the
above species except Fucus, and in addition has large
populations of both L. planaxis and L. scutulata. It
is situated on a granite shelf west of Pescadero Point.
at a height of about +4 feet, and was divided for survey
purposes into two sections, each of approximately 2
square meters in area, The first is largely horizontal,
with a number of crevasses up to 10 cm deep, and a small
tidepool. Cladophora is the dominant alga, with some
Endocladia and Rhodoglossum also present: the algae
aree largely confined to the crevasses and around the
tidepool, leaving the elevated rock areas bare. The
second consists of the verticle west face of the shelf
and some of the contiguous horizontal top, about 2 meters
from the first area, and at the same level. It is almost
entirely covered with algae, with Endocladia, Rhodoglossum,
Pelvetia, and Gigartina cristata the most common species,
