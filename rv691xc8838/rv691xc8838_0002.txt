MACROSCOPIC ALGAL FOODS OF
LITTORINA PLANAXIS AND L. SCUTULATA
The upper littoral periwinkles of the central
California coast are often found in association with
a number of the higher intertidal macroscopic algae.
This paper examines the place of these algae as a food
source for Littorina planaxis Philippi, one of the
highest intertidal animals, and for its somewhat lower
though overlapping relative L. scutulata Gould. The
studies and observations upon which this paper is based
were made on the Monterey Peninsula, on the central
California coast, especially at Mussel Point in the
vicinity of the Hopkins Marine Station, and near Pescadero
Point. The coastline in these areas consists principally
of granite boulders and outcroppings interspersed with
sandy beaches, and heavily overgrown with larger algae
through most of the littoral zone. Observations were
made during May, 1964, and therefore do not reflect any
seasonal fluctuations that might take place.
Despite the fact that both Littorina planaxis and
L. scutulata are a conspicuous part of the upper littoral
fauna over much of the Pacific coast of North America,
