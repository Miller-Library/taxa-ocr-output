are frequently found almost entire on the stomach of
L. planaxis. The structure of the radula and other
mouth parts seems to be similar for both specias, and,
superficially at least, matched that of Littorina littorea
as described by Fretter and Graham (1962).
What the littorines digest out of what they take in
is still uncertain. Undigested cells and tissue fragments
are frequently found in the feces, supporting North (1954)
in his conclusion that their digestive efficiency is
low, with organic matter assimilation about 7 percent
of consumption. Cell wall material seems especially
conspicuous, at least in the stomach, and was often
useful in identifying the algae on which the snail had
fed.
Littorina planaxis does not frequently come into
contact with macroscopic algae; most of its range is
well above the limits of algal growth. Thereeare areas,
however, where it is found with all of the algae listed
previously. In such areas, it shows a decided preference
for a rock substrate (For the purposes of this study
the term "rock substrate" includes both microscopic
and encrusting algal forms; "algal substrate" refers
to macroscopic algae with other than an encrusting
thallus. The substrate is the surface to which the
snail is attached, and on which, presumably, it is
feeding). One survey of the area near Pescadero Point
