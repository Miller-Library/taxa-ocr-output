Discussion: These results give strong evidence that arginine is significantiy
compartmentalized in the sea urchin egg. The values of total arginine per
cell of 50 and 47 picomoles of arginine per cell compare favorably with
results of Gross and Fry as repoted by Giudice (1973) of .32 picomoles of
inine per cell. Some research tends to suggest that compartments of
ginine and other amino acids could exist in the sea urchin egg. Lee and
