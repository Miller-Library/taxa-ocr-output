200ulof 25mMpyruvate 200ulof 5 Mtriethanolamine buffer wth 25mM
EDTA, 400ul of 015 mM NADH, 5 unit of octopine dehydrogenase (in 5Oul),
50ulof extractand 14miof distilled water. The final volume in the cuwette
was 2.5 ml. After thereaction reached equilibrium, 10 ulof 2 mM arginine
was added as an internal standard.
Results: The change in fluorescence of NADH brought about by cell extract
wascompared tothe change of fluorescence caused by an internal standard
of 002 umolesofarginine. Since the change in fluorescence is diree
proportionalto the arginine present,
