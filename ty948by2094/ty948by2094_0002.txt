This teaction is catalyzed by the enzyme arginine kinase. Since this is the
only reaction by which arginine is phosphorwlated, the equation for the

signifies that the rise in the ratio of arginine phosphate to arginine (AP/A)as
is seen at fertilization should signify a corresponding rise in the ratio of ATF
to ADP. By rearranging the above equation, this concept becomes more clear.

brought about by the rise in the AP/A ratio at fertilization is dependant
upon the values for keq and for H' remaining constant. The value for keg
