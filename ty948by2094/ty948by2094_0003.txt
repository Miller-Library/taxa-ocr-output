APIA ratio that occurs at fertilization should signal a similar rise in the
ratio of ATP to ALP. However, such an increase in the IATPI/IADP! ratio is
not generally observed. There is littie consensus as to what actually happens
to the ATP/ADP ratio. For instance, Epel (1969) has observed that it remains
