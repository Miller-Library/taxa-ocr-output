Abstract Strong evidence for the compartmentation ofarginine in oth
unfertilized and fertilized seaurhin egge wasotined yopaine
arginine content of an extract obtained from permeabilizeeggs with the
arginine content of an extract produced by extracting the same eggswith
105e heat. A significant portion of the total arginine of the egg was found in
the hestentract. This suggests that some arginine is sequestered within
1yhanging compartments
Introduction: The unfertilized sea urchin egg is a very sleepy cell
metabolically, but fertilization triggers an activation of the egg which is
chafacterized by a sharp increase in oxidative phosphorylation, protein
synthesis and other metabolic processes. Another effect of activation is a rise
in the level of arginine phosphate (Chambers and Mende 1953) Arginine
phosphate often occurs in invertebrates and is analogous to creatine
phosphate in vertebrates. In the sea urchin egg, arginine phosphate serves
as a buffer of high energy phosphate and is closely linked to the energ
status of the cell. When arginine phosphate is depleted, several cellular
metabolic activities such as protein synthesis (Winklerand Linde.
