Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Professor Barbara Block, Dave Marcinek, and Chuck Farwell of MBA.
for guiding me and encouraging me throughout this project and Carolyn for helping to coordinate
the feedings, and for sharing her compassion for the tuna we fed. I would also like to thank Scotty
and Manny of MBA for their help at feedings and the rest of the Block lab for making me feel part
of the lab and for helping me on many occasions- especially John and Rich for battling with
computers with me, and Tara for assisting me with some of the feedings.Thanks also goes out to
my father who created the new histological technique of sticking tissue to slides with crazy glue.
Thank you all,
Bianca
