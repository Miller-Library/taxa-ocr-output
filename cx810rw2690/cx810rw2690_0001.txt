Food Requirements and Lipid Accumulation in Captive Yellowfin
Tuna: Thunnus albacares
Bianca Perla, May 1995

Through the months of December 1994-March 1995 captive yellowfin tuna kept at the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center in Monterey, CA. displayed behavioral and physiological signs
of high whole body lipid levels. Autopsies revealed lipid accumulation in the heart, gills and
muscles, and 4 sudden deaths occurred that may have been due to cardiac arrest or lipid
accumulation in the blood. The fish acted sluggish and over-satiated during feedings.
Possible high lipid levels in the diet were thought to be a contributing factor to increased lipid
storage in the tissue. To test this hypothesis, diet was cut for the months of April and May from 2
times a day every day to once a day every other day. Individual tuna in each tank were followed
during the feedings and data were recorded on type of food eaten, amount of food eaten and
activity level before and during feeding. Food amounts obtained from these observations were
analyzed for fat content and total caloric content. Old and new diets were compared on this basis.
In addition histological techniques were used to compare fat levels in red and white muscle
tissue of TRCC tuna-fed a diet of squid, anchovies and sardines, with Kewalo basin captive tuna
- fed a diet of 100% squid.
Activity of the tuna on the reduced diet increased dramatically. Analysis of fat content and
caloric content of both old and new diets revealed that a reduction in total calories as well as a
reduction in fat content on the new diet may have contributed to the increased activity and overall
health of the TRCC tuna. It was also found that it may be possible to decrease total fat content of
the diet while keeping total caloric intake from falling. Histological staining of tissues revealed
that TRCC tuna contain higher levels of lipid, than Kewalo basin tuna, in both red and white
muscle tissues.
