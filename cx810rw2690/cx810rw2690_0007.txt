Histology
Qualitative analysis revealed that TRCC tuna red and white muscle tissues contained more lipid
between muscle fibers than Kewalo basin tuna tissues (see figures 11- 14). As shown in figures
11-14, the hematoxylin stain used by Bay Histology for the Kewalo basin tuna and the TRCC
captive tuna, stained muscle fibers dark pink or red and left lipid unstained (white). The lipid
apparent in these stains was extracellular lipid- lipid between muscle cells. Ã–smium stains and Oil
Red O stains indicated intracellular lipid as small circular droplets within individual muscle cells.
An osmium stain, by Bay Histology, revealed possible high levels of intracellular lipid in TRCC
captive tuna red muscle. However, Oil Red O stains for intracellular lipid in wild and TRCC
specimens were not perfected to a level appropriate for comparison.
Discussion
Diet
Switching to a diet significantly lower in fat created positive changes in tuna behavior and
health: activity is high and no deaths from cardiac arrest have occurred since the new diet.
However, since this was correlated with a significant decrease in total calories on the new diet,
decrease in total energy intake must not be ignored as contributing to these behavorial changes.
Since the fish were acting over- satiated and sluggish at feedings, and are no longer doing so after
a cut in total calories and fat calories, it seems strongly possible that both the total calories and fat
calories on the old diet were too high.
Judging from the trend in all tanks between April and May decreasing calories from fat without
decreasing total calories consumed is possible to some extent. This was accomplished by
eliminating high fat foods, specifically anchovies, from the diet. If total fat content can be
decreased with out decreasing total calories consumed enough energy can be provided to the tuna
