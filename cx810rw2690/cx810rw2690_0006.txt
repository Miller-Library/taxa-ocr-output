Caloric intake per day on the new diet decreased to 75% for TI, and T2 between December and
May. T3 caloric intake decrease by about 25% between December and May (see figure 1). T-tests
revealed that there was a significant difference between caloric content of the old and new diets (TI
pâ€”.0048, T2 p-2.7e-8, T3 p-.000108).
As shown in figures 2,3,and 4, fat calories eaten per day decreased significantly for all tanks
from the old to the new diet (T1 p-.0024, T2 p-.013, T3 p-3.83e-6). Between April and May
calories increased slightly for TI and T2 and stayed constant for T3 while fat calories decreased in
all tanks. The decrease in fat calories was only significant for T2 (p-3.83e-4) yet it was a trend for
all tanks. While percent fat did not seem to be greatly affected by the amount of squid and
sardines eaten per feeding (Figures 5,6,7) percent fat eaten per feeding did correlate closely with
percent anchovies eaten per feeding for each individual fish observed (see Figures 8,9,10).
In TI observed calories eaten per day for Tip were not significantly different than the
calories/day expected for both old and new diets (old diet p-.68, new diet p-.48). T2 observed
and expected values were significantly different in March (p-.02) and April (2.8e-8) but not for the
other months observed (Feb p-.280, May p=.81). The observed values for Notch in T3 were not
significantly different than expected values for the old diet (p-.287) but were significantly different
for the months of April and May (p-.005).
Behavior
Behavior during feedings is drastically different on the new diet. Fish activity increased
dramatically. For example, fish surge and sprint toward the food thrown into the tank. They even
leap out of the water at times and make sharp turns to orient themselves toward the food source.
Now the tunas compete for food. Food is swiped from the mouths of some individuals by others
and nipping at another tuna was observed once in T2 (May 25 1995). Fish show what appears to
be anticipatory behavior before feeding in all tanks- especially Tank 1. Fish congregate toward the
feeding platform whenever some one stands on it.
