Figure 1: Average calories eaten per fish per day calculated from expected values over 6 months.
Compares the old diet (December-March 1995) with the new diet (April- May 1995).
Figure 2: Average calories observed eaten per day by Tip in TI. Average fat calories eaten per day
are shown as well. Tip was observed Jan-May 1995.
Figure 3: Average calories observed eaten per day by RN in T2. Average fat calories eaten per
day shown as well. RN was observed February 1995-May 1995.
igure 4: Average calories observed eaten per day by Notch in T3. Average fat calories eaten per
day shown as well. Notch was observed December- May 1995.
Figure 5: %fat calories eaten per day by Tip for 6 feeding days in April. This is compared to the
% of sardines, anchovies and squid that Tip ate at each meal. Notice how fat levels rise and fall
most drastically with % anchovies eaten out of total meal.
Figure 6: Same as Figure 5 for RN in T2.
Figure 7: Same as Figure 6 for Notch in T3.
Figure 8: %fat in calories of total meal compared to % of anchovies eaten out of total meal for 6
feeding days in April 1995. Tip-TI.
Figure 9: Same as figure 8 for RN, T2.
Figure 10: same as Figure 8 for Notch, T3.
Figure 11: White muscle of TRCC captive tuna stained with hematoxylin. Light colored or white
patches are lipid in between muscle bundles. Dark patches are muscle bundles. 20 magnification.
Figure 12: Red muscle of TRCC tuna stained with hematoxylin. Light colored patches are lipid,
dark colored patches are muscle. 20 magnification.
Figure 13: White muscle of Kewalo basin tuna stained with hematoxylin. 20 magnification. Light
color=lipid between muscle bundles. Darkcolor- muscle.
Figure 14: Red muscle of Kewalo basin tuna stained with hematoxylin. 20 magnification. Light
color = lipid. Dark color- muscle.
