obtained by dividing the total amount fed to the tank per day by the number of fish in each tank.
These values were compared to observed values to see if individual feeding habits could be
extrapolated to other fish in the tank.
Histology
To discover if lipid levels in TRCC tuna were indeed high, red and white muscle tissue samples
of TRCC tuna, wild tuna, and Kewalo basin captive tuna were qualitatively analyzed for lipid
content. Histology for the Kewalo basin tuna and for the TRCC captive tuna was done by Bay
Histology. The stain used was hematoxylin which stained muscle cells pink and left lipid white.
Muscle tissues of wild tuna and TRCC tuna were also stained for intra-cellular lipid. Samples
of red and white muscle, fixed in 10% formalin were frozen, cut at -20 degrees Celsius on a
cryostat, and stained for lipid with Oil Red O (Bancroft, 1975). TRCC tuna tissue broke easily
when cut. To increase strength of the tissue it was cryoprotected by soaking it in SM and IM
sucrose solutions prior to freeze clamping them. Because of the high lipid content, TRCC tuna
tissue did not adhere to the slides well and fell off during the staining process. To combat this
problem I used Cetyl-Acetylene glue to stick the tissue to the slide for staining (Perla, pers.
comm.).
Ã„fter staining, the slides were photographed with a zeiss axioplot microscope and lipid contents
of each test tissue were qualitatively compared.
Results
Diet
Bomb calorimetery tests revealed that anchovies had the highest percent lipid of all the food
eaten (Table 1). Mean weights for small and large food items stayed constant throughout the
study (Table 2).
