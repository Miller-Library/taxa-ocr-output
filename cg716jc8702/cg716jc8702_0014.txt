Fig. 2 The role of molecular chaperones.
Fig. 3 Hsp 70 regulation. Adapted from Somero 1998.
Fig. 4 This figure shows the mean band 1 intensity of Hsp 70 expression for the
intertidal, subtidal, and field groups over the first three weeks. The
asterisk denotes statistically significant differences between the
intertidal and subtidal treatments.
Fig. 5 This figure shows the mean band 2 intensity of Hsp 70 expression for the
intertidal, subtidal, and field groups over the first three weeks. The
asterisk denotes statistically significant differences between the
intertidal and subtidal treatments.
