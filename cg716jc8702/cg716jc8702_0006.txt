One gill from each mussel was then homogenized with a lysis buffer (30ml: 7.5ml
32mM Tris-HCL pH 6.8, 6ml 2% SDS (10% stock solution, 60ul 1mM EDTA (500 mM
stock), 150ul 0.25mg/ml Pefabloc, 60ul 10ug/ml Pepstatin, 60ul 10ug/ml Leupeptin
16.70ml H20) in a 1:5 ratio and the protein concentration was quantified.
Protein Analysis: SDS-PAGE and Western Blot
Next, SDS-PAGE was used to resolve the proteins of each of the samples,
which were run in duplicate. In addition, in each gel 3ul of Hsc 70 were run as a way
to standardize each gel so that they could be compared. When the gels are
transferred and finally exposed to film the resulting "picture" may not have the same
intensity from gel to gel. By having Hsc 70, a band of known quantity, in the gel one
can compare the intensity of that band to the rest of the bands in the gels when
quantifying. Thus the resulting intensities of the bands from gel to gel for the samples
will be standardized. All gels were run for one hour at 200 volts. The proteins on each
gel were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The transfer was done at 80
volts for one hour and fifteen minutes (Laemmli, 1970).
Next, Western Blots were run on each of the membranes. The membranes
were placed in a blocking buffer (250ml: 25ml 1XTBS, 12.5g 5% non-fat dried milk,
0.05g 0.02% Thimesosol, 0.250ml 0.1% Tween, add H2O) for one hour. The primary
alpha antibody MA3-OO1 was then added to the membranes for one hour. The
membranes were then washed with 1XTBS with and without Tween. The second
antibody, A8-4000, was then added for 30 minutes, and the membranes were then
washed again. Finally a Protein A-peroxidase mixture was added to the membranes
for one hour followed by the washes (Laemmli, 1970). The membranes were then
exposed to equal volumes of Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents 1 and 2
for one minute and then wrapped in Saran wrap (Pierce Chemical Company, Super
Signal: Western Blotting Substrates Handbook). Chemiluminescence is the reaction
