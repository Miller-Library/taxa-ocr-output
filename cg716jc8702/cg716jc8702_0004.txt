occurs this complex breaks down and the Hsp70 binds to denatured proteins. HSF is
then free to bind to HSE, the gene regulator, and transcription and translation of
additional Hsp70 occurs. With increased heat stress more and more of the Hsp7O-
HSF complex disassociates. In other words, the level of Hsp70 production is related
to the intensity of the heat stress.
Looking at heat shock expression in a particular species can give us insight to
that animal's environment. Many species are often living at the edges of their thermal
ranges. By looking at Hsp 70 expression in animals held in particular environments
we can understand the thermal ranges of species and tease apart why certain
species are found in different parts of the intertidal. In addition, if the pattern of Hsp 70
expression is followed over a period of time we can understand the ability of
organisms to acclimate to thermal stress as well as to changes in their environment.
This study looks at the expression of heat shock proteins in subtidal and intertidal
Mytilus californianus in hopes of understanding some of these patterns.
This study also looks at the expression of heat shock proteins in M
californianus of different sizes. It has been shown that the body temperature of large
mussels rises rapidly and remains high during low tide periods. The body
temperatures of smaller mussels, on the other hand, fluctuate with environmental
conditions. It is possible that mussels of different sizes express Hsp 70 in different
quantities or at different times in order to deal with different body temperature
patterns. Understanding such patterns could provide substantial insight as to how M
californianus and other intertidal organisms survive heat shock and other stress
during development.
