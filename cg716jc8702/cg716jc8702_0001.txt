Abstract
Heat shock proteins are one type of molecular chaperone. Their primary
responsibility is to help refold proteins that are denatured due to high temperatures
These proteins are essential for organisms living at the edges of their thermal
ranges, for example, many intertidal organisms which may be exposed to potentially
lethal temperatures during low tide periods. An example of such an intertidal
organism is the mussel Mytilus californianus, which is found in both subtidal and
intertidal locations, and can often experience temperatures of 30Â° C and higher. Such
temperatures were seen in the two artificial tide pools, one subtidal and one intertidal,
which were created for this study. Equal numbers of M. californianus ranging in size
were placed in the two pools and samples were collected over five weeks.
Subsequent analysis showed that Heat shock protein-70 (Hsp 70) is expressed in
response to extreme temperatures. The expressed Hsp 70 was visualized on the
gels as two isoform bands - band 1 and band 2. Comparing the mean band 1 and
band 2 intensities of Hsp 70 for both subtidal and intertidal groups of M. californianus
over five weeks has shown that the intertidal group had elevated levels of Hsp 70 in
comparison to the subtidal group for all weeks compared.
