point corresponds to the original twenty mussels that were dissected after being held
in an indoor tank for one week.
Figure 4 shows that for all three weeks the intensity of Hsp 70 - band 1 for the
intertidal treatment was higher then the intensity of Hsp 70 - band 1 expression for the
subtidal group. Statistical analysis using Systat shows that overall this difference is
statistically significant (p-value= 0.008). Statistical analysis was also done to make
pairwise comparisons of both treatments for each week. For band 1 intensity
differences between treatments were significant only for week 2 (p-value = 0.021).
Since there are presently no field data for week 1, the statistical tests did not
incorporate this "treatment.
Figure 5 shows the mean band 2 intensity data. Again, the intertidal treatment
group had higher intensities of Hsp 70 expression for all three weeks. Overall, the
treatment effects were statistically significant (p-value =0.000). Statistical
comparisons were then done by week. For the band 2 intensities both weeks 1 and 3
were statistically different (week 1 p-value = 0.019, week 2 p-value = 0.005). The p¬
value for week 2 (p-value = 0.061) was close to being statistically significant. Once
again, there are presently no field data for week one and, therefore, this group was not
included in the statistical tests.
Figure 6 shows the body temperatures of a small mussel in the simulated
intertidal pool over the course of the study. The peaks corresponds to highest
temperatures seen during low tide periods. The base line is roughly 15°C, the
temperature of the water coming through the flow-through system.
Discussion
The results collected thus far suggest that the intertidal mussels are indeed
experiencing heat stress. Both bands 1 and 2 are showing elevated levels of Hsp 70
