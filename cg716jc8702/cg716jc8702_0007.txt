that occurs between an enzyme like horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a
chemiluminescent molecule. This reaction results in an intensified light emission
which allows the band images to be captured on pre flashed, X-ray film (Kodak) when
exposed. During the course of this study exposed time was set at 30 seconds and
the film was then immediately developed.
then scanned the developed film into a computer using Lab Scan, a digital
computer scanning program. Each band on each gel was then quantified using
Image Master 1-D Prime software. The results for each gel were standardized using
the Hsc7O quantity for that particular gel. Finally, the statistical program Systat was
used to compare the subtidal and intertidal treatments overall and per week.
Temperature Data
Temperature data were collected using StowAway XTI data logger chips stored
in waterproof containers. Four data loggers were set out at the start of the experiment.
One was placed in the subtidal pool to record water temperatures. The remaining
three were placed in the intertidal pool, one to record water temperatures, one to
record the body temperatures of a small mussel, and one to record the body
temperatures of a large mussel. All of the data loggers were pre tested for accuracy
and were then set to record the temperature every ten minutes throughout the course
of the study. At the end of the experiment the data were retrieved. Only data from the
small intertidal mussel data logger could be retrieved.
Results
Figures 4 and 5 show the mean band intensities for the two Hsp 70 isoforms -
bands 1 and 2 - for the subtidal and intertidal treatments for weeks 1-3. The control
