This connection might be one way of explaining the pattern of Hsp 70 expression
seen in week 3.
Future Work
Further studies to be done this summer will include analysis of the samples for
weeks 4 and 5. I will also complete the analysis of the field data set so that this group
can be compared to the two pool treatments. The MDH analysis will also be done so
that we can understand the energy budget of the three groups. This summer Iwill
also analyze the band intensities based on the size of the mussels in order to
determine if there is any difference in Hsp 70 expression between small and large
mussels.
Conclusion
Thus far, results have shown that subtidal vs. intertidal mussels do differ in
their expression of Hsp 70 for at least the first three weeks. I am not sure how the
field data will correspond to the above two treatments. However it seems that the
mean band intensities are usually below the mean band intensities for the subtidal
group. Week three is the only exception to this pattern so far and analysis of the
samples for weeks 4 and 5, as well as MDH quantification should help to clarify this
paradox. Finally, comparison of Hsp 70 expression by body size will give clearer
understanding of how mussels deal with heat stress during development.
