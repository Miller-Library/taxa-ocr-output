Aquaria Setup and Mussel Collection
Prior to the start of this experiment, I collected approximately 300 M.
californianus and placed them in an indoor aquarium with a flow-through water
system. These mussels were left in this tank for one week in order for them to
acclimate to a common temperature. During this week two "tide pools" were set up,
one intertidal and the other subtidal. Both pools were made out of kiddy pools. The
bottoms of the pools were covered with rocks and these rocks were then covered with
burlap. There was a drain in the side of each pool below the level of the burlap. This
way the intertidal pool could drain completely and the mussels placed on the burlap
would see complete emersion. Both pools had a flow-through water system. The
subtidal pool was left running all of the time, and the flow-through system for the
intertidal pool was outfitted with a timer which controlled the "tides." Low tide occurred
every day from 10am to 2pm.
ÄAfter the collected mussels had been in the indoor aquarium tank for one week
20 mussels with a wide range of body sizes were collected and kept as a control
group. The remaining mussels were divided into two groups of equivalent size
ranges and numbers (147 per pool) and placed in the two tide pools. Äfter one week
eight mussels ranging in size from small to large were collected from each pool. In
addition to the mussels collected from the two tide pools, eight mussels were also
collected from the intertidal site where all of the mussels were originally collected.
This sample of eight mussels also ranged in body size from small to large. This
collection protocol was repeated weekly for five weeks.
Once these samples were collected, all of the mussels were measured and
dissected. The length, width and height of the shell were measured as well as the full
body weight and the soft body weight. Both gills and the abductor muscle were kept.
