PROTEIN FOLDING occurs spontaneously because of thermodynamic constraints
imposed by the protein's sequence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids.
Although proteins can fold themselves into biologically functional configurations
(self-assembly), errors in folding can occasionally occur. Stress proteins seem to
help ensure that cellular proteins fold themselves rapidly and with high fidelity.
