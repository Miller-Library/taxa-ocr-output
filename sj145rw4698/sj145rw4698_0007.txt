Table l shows the results of a one day chemical
study made in the Pt. Pinos area. This table also
includes information on temperature, pH and dissolved
oxygen levels determined at both high and low tides.
It can be seen from the low tide figures that a gradient
exists on either side of the outfall, which suggests
that areas 2-5 in Figure 2 may be the most effected by
the effluent. Note that the differencesiin physical-
chemical parameters at high tide all but disappear.
This suggests that at high tide the effluent is diluted
considerably with fresh seawater. Figure 1 shows a
composite of the local currents at both high and low
tides. This data appears to account for the distribution
of the effluent around the point. Coupling the information
from Table 1 and Figure 1 one would expect to find damage
in areas 3, 4, 6 and 11 in Figure 3, as well as areas
in the immediate vicinity of the outfall.
As mentioned earlier, the distribution of macrofauna
and flora in the immediate outfall area shows a marked change
from other areas of the point. The numbers of algal and
invertebrate species present is severely reduced, and
many of those organisms whish are present appear sickly
and unhealthy.
Endocladia: Table 2 shows the tabulated data for
samples of Endocladia. Note the variation in the total
number of taxonomic groups in relation to distance from
the outfall. Also of some significance is the mean number
