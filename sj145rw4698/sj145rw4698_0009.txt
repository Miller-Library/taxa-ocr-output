diversity indices and numbers of taxonomic groups as a
function of distance from theoutfall. Note the strong dip in
the region of the outfall, and the smaller dip in area 11.
Corralina: The tabulated data for Corralina is shown
in TÃ¤bles6. Once again, note the changes in total number
of taxonomic groups and diversity indices in sample sites
near and away from the outfall. Also, the numbers of orga-
nisms per gram dry weight shows a drop in samples taken in
the outfall area. Table 7 demonstrates the species compo-
sition for these samples. Note the marked differences in
the occurence of the Amphipods, Puggetia and the tunicates.
Also, to a lesser extent, Pagurus, Mohnia and Tricolia show
similar trends.
Figure 9 shows the distribution by phyla for the
Corralina samples. Only the Arthropoda seem to show any kind
of gradient through the outfall area. A plot of the mean
number of taxonomic groups and diversity indices against the
areas sampled is shown in Figure 10.
Specific indicators of pollution: Figure 11 shows a
listing of the species found associated with Corralina (top)
and Prionitis (bottom) which appear to show the greatest
variation in abundance as related to the presence of the out-
fall. Of the species found with Endocladia, only the Amphipods
showed distributional effects related to the outfall area.
