of animals per gram dry weight for the replicate areas
and the ranges for the diversity indices at increased
distances from the outfall. Table 3 shows the species
composition of the animals found. Species seem to be
rather evenly distributed, except for the Amphipoda,
which do not appear in samples taken in the immediate
area of the outfall (10 meters radius). Figure 5 illus-
trates the distribution by phyla. Again, other than the
Arthropoda, there appears to be a relatively even dis-
tribution. A plot of the mean diversity indices and
mean numbers of taxonomic groups for the replicate areas
is shown in Figure 6, and these curves show dips at the
outfall and at area 9 across the point from the outfall.
Prionitis: Table 4 presents the tabulated data for
Prionitis. Again, note the changes in the total number of
taxonomic groups present and the diversity indices at sites
around the point. Area 9 shows a very definite cut-off
line where both of these parametersgo from low values to
quite high values. It may be that these figures reflect
the radius of effect of the effluent for this species of
alga and it's microfauna. Table 5 demonstrates the species
composition of the samples. It appears from this table that
Nereid worms, Amphipods and Copepods by their absence,
and Tethymia aptena, a fly larvae, by it's presence may
serve as pollution indicators. The distribution by
phyla (Figure 7) suggests that the Arthropods, Annelids
and Molluscs are effected in the outfall area within a radius
of 25 meters. Figure 8 represents a plot of the mean
