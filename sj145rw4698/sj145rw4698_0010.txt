Discussion
The results indicate that the primary treated effluent
is causing changes in the distribution of algal microfauna
in the Pt. Pinos area. This is shown by the fact that gra-
dients in microfaunal populations through the outfall area cor-
respond with chemical gradients produced by the dispersed
effluent. Current study results show how the effluent may
be dispersed in this manner.
That a change in the microfauna exists is shown by var-
iations in diversity indices, total number of taxonomic groups
and mean numbers of animals per gram dry weight found in
samples within the area influenced by the effluent. These
variations are in full accord with the dispersal pattern of
the effluent material. In two species, Prionitis and
Corralina, certain species found in other areas completely
disappear from the samples taken in the vicinity of the out-
fall, suggesting that they might be potential indicator
species.
The effect of tidal height is important. Endocladia
showed radical variations in the immediate outfall area, but
at greater distances seemed relatively unaffected. However,
it does seem that at high tide contaminated water crosses the
point and effects the community on the north side. This
again is suggested by the pattern of effluent movement at
high tide.
Prionitis showed a marked effect in the outfall area,
with the influence of the sewage effluent apparently extending
