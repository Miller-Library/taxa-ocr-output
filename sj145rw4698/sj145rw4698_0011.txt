farther to the east and west than in Endocladia. Only
a slight effect is observed in Prionitis across the point
from the outfall. As the primaryly fresh water effluent
wouls tend to float on the surface, it may be that at high
tide the water crossing the point affects only the higher
intertidal species such as Endocladia. When this water cros-
sing the point encounters incoming water on the north side of
the point, its movement may be slowed to the point where
heavier materials in the effluent may settle out. Thus
while the mid-intertidal may not be effected, the material
settling out may effect the low intertidal, as observed
below with Corralina.
Corralina shows broad-based effects extending in both
directions from the outfall, with a slight effect seen in
the area directly across the point from the outfall.
From these results it seems that Endocladia is only
subjected to the effects of the sewage at high tides, when
the effluent is most dilute (Table 1). Also, at high tide
polluted water crosses the point and apparently damages the
communities there in a limited area, This is in accord with
the earlier predictions made on the basis of chemical and
current studies. Prionitis is subjected to effluent laden
waters on rising, falling and during high tides. Corralina
is exposed to strongly polluted waters only at very low
tides! At other times the polluted water covering this alga
are probably well diluted. The most strongly polluted water
would at all times be found on the surface due to the fresh
water nature of the effluent.
