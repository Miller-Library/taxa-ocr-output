sites ranged from +3.0 to +5.0 feet, with all samples
being taken from horizontal surfaces. All sample sites
were equally exposed to high tide wave action. Figure 2
shows the location of the Endocladia sample sites.
Replicate samples are grouped into area for convenience
and future reference. No Endocladia samples were taken
from Area l to Area 2 due to the fact that no Endocladia
could be found in this area. Whether or not the absence
of this alga can be attributed to the effects of the ef-
fluent is unclear.
Prionitis lanceolata was chosen as being a representa-
tive alga of the mid-intertidal. (+1.0 to +3.0 ft.)
This species was the only macroalga present in the im-
mediate outfall area. Figure 3 shows the location of the
Prionitis sample sites, which range from 0.0 to 14.5 feet.
Exposure ranges from semi-protected on the north side of the
point to full wave shock in areas 3-8.
Corralina vancouveriensus was chosen as a representative
alga of the low intertidal. (-1.0 to +1.0 ft.) Sample
sites range from -1.0 to +1.0 feet. Figure 4 shows the
location of these sample sites, all of which were open to
direct wave action at low tide. Due to adverse conditions
however, fewer Corralina samples were collected.
Each of these algae are perennials, and as such can
be expected to have a permanent population of associated
microfauna (Abbott, 1970).
