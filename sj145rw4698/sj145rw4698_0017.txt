Fig.1.
Current systems in the Pt. Pinos Area, Monterey,
California. Composite of flourescein dye and
drift bottle studies of nearshore currents in and
about Pt. Pinos during the Spring of 1970.
The stipled area represents the visible sewage
field. Arrows indicate the direction and relative
strength of the current systems studied. Results of
more recent studies concurrent with this investigation
suggested that these patterns are similar to those
prevailing during this study.
