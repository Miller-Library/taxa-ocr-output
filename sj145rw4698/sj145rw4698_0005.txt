Wave action ranged from slight in areas 1, 2 and
3, to heavy in areas 4-9 (Figure 3). Samples collected
from the west end of the point, area 10, were protected
from wave action but experienced a strong surge on both
rising and falling tides. Samples from areas 11, 12 and
13 recieved a moderate amount of wave action. Sites
further east along the north side of the point, area 12,
recieved only light surf (Figure 2).
Collections were made at periods of low tide,
employing a chisel to remove the alga and it's holdfast
from the rocks. These were placed in plastic bags and
brought back to the lab for analysis. From-5.0 to 20.0
grams of Endocladia and Corralina were collected on each
occasion except where not available in areas 1 and 2.
In those cases the algae available was taken. In the case
of Prionitis samples one entire plant and holdfast was
taken for each sample. Samples were taken from ten areas
each time, with a 2-4 day interim between replicates.
The samples were analyzed by placing them in finger bowls
with 5% ethanol in distilled water and removing the organisms
under a dissecting scope. Organisms were identified as
closely as possible then preserved in 80% ethanol for
further reference. The algae were dried for-24 hours at
60 C in a drying oven and weighed.
The Simpson and Shannon-Weiner indices were used to
compute the species diversity for each sample. The
