Introduction
The effects of sewage effluents on the marine environ-
ment are not well understood. While fresh water and estuarine
pollution have been rigorously studied, (Jones, 1964;
Ingram, Mackenthum, Bartsch, 1966 ), the marine situation
has been sorely neglected. A major reason for this has
been the difficulty in isolating sewage effects in a
complicated marine environment. At the present time local
and State Health Agencies have been relegated to using
coliform bacteria counts as the only standard measure of
pollution. Experience has shown, however, that this method
is unsatisfactory (Carter, Carpenter, Whaley, 1967;
Nuebaum, Garver, 1955 ). A more accurate and substantial
indicator of marine pollution is needed. It was with this
problem in mind that the present study was undertaken.
Pacific Grove, California, discharges approximately
1.6 million gallons of primary treated sewage daily from an
outfall located on Point Pinos within the boundaries of the
Pt. Pinos Lighthouse Reservation, a Marine Life Preserve.
The end of the outfall is located approximately 160 meters
from the base of the point in a rocky intertidal area on the
south side, and lies one foot below mean lower low water
(-1.0 ft.) in a region that recieves heavy surf.
Studies carried out during the Spring of 1970 at the
Hopkins Marine Station revealed significant differences in
macrofaunal and floral distribution between the immediate
outfall area and other, less polluted regions of the point.
