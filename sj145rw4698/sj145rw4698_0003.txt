However, these overt differences were limited to a small
area of no more than 20 meters radius from the end of the
pipe. A search for an indicator of more widespread and
subtle effects suggested the efficacy of studying micro-
faunal distribution in the Pt. Pinos area. Might not
microfaunal distributions and associations reflect subtle
differences in the environment not mirrored by by macro-
fauna? Specifically, might algae-microfaunal associations,
which are numerous and constant for a given defined region
(Glynn, 1963 ) serve as an indicator of marine pollution?
I decided to study the distribution of microfauna on
three species of algae characteristic of low (-1.0 to +1.0
ft.), medium (+1.0 to +3.0 ft.) and high (+3.0 to 15.0 ft.)
tidal heights in order to determine the effects of the effluent
as well as the role played by tidal height.
Material and Methods
Preliminary information on currents and physical-
chemical attributes of the study area was obtained from
investigations made in the Spring of 1970 at the Hopkins
Marine Station (Anon, 1970).
Samples of algae were taken from around the point at
convenient locations. All sample locations were resampled
one to three times. The algae chosen were all red algae,
the most extensive group present in this area.
Endocladia muricata was chosen as being the representative
alga of the high intertidal. (+3.0 to +5.0 ft.). The sample
