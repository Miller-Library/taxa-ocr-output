Simpson index is given by the formula
where Nis the total number
D- N(N-1
of animals found
En(n-1)
and nis the number of individuals
of each species.
This index corresponds to the number of randomly selected
pairs of individuals that must be drawn from a community
in order to have an even chance of obtaining a pair with
both individuals of the same species.
The Shannon-Weiner index is based on the Shannon-Weiner
function from the field of information theory. As a
diversity index for biotic communities the function
describes the average degree of uncertainty of predicting
the species of an individual picked at random from the
community. It is given by the formula
D= 3.219 (19510 -1Enlog 10n)
where N and nare the same as for the Simpson index
(Cox, 1967).
Neither index is free from sample size bias, but
both are equally affected. It must be kept in mind,
however, that I am applying these indices to samples of
different sizes. The Simpson index would be expected to
give low results for samples containing one species
in great excess of the others.
