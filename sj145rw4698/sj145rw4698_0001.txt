Abstract
The effect of primary treated sewage on the distribution
and abundance of microfauna found associated with three species
of algae, characteristic of the low, mid and high intertidal,
was studied. The results show that the sewage effluent
effects thesdistribution of microfauna most srtongly in
Prionitis lanceolata and Corralina vancouveriensus, algae
representative of mid and low intertidal species, Microfauna
associated with Endocladia muricata, the representative alga
of the high intertidal, was effected only in the immediate
region of the outfall. Information from current studies
and chemical-physical assays in the study area allowed a
hypothesis of effluent dispersal and effect to be made.
Certain species, by their presence or absence on algae
in the immediate outfall area, seem to be possible indicators
of marine pollution.
