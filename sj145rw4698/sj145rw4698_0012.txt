appears to be noticeable. Outside of this area, variations
in the parameters measured cannot be attributed solely to
the presence of effluent because of natural variation.
However, sewage effluent may be contributing to some of
the differences observed. Mid-intertidal and low intertidal
algae and microfauna seem to be the most strongly effected,
with high intertidal species effected but slightly.
It also appears that certain species of animals,
notably the Amphipods, Copepods, Pugettia, Nereid worms,
Tricolia, Mohnia and Barleeia by their absence and
Tethymia aptena, by its presence on the effected algae may
serve as specific indicators of pollution. More research
concerning the distribution of these species in polluted
waters may prove their usefulness to field workers looking
for a criterion of marine pollution.
A specific ecological survey, as presented here, can be
usefull in showing the extent and severity of damage in
polluted areas:. However, such a study demands considerable
time and effort on the part of the investigator. This
approach has provided insights into possible specific
indicators of pollution, which may be usefull tools in
combating the degredation of our environment.
