The Endocladia Zone

young and are found in the holdfasts of E. muricata (Glynn 1965). Therefore,
Lasaea may be competing with Musculus for space in the Endocladia zone. This
hypothesis is consistent with the fact that Lasaea cistula was one of the species
with the highest relative abundance in Glynn's high quadrats, while Musculus
sp. was one of the species with the highest relative abundance in his lower
quadrats.
While Lasaea populations seem hindered by the shift in Endocladia's
vertical distribution, the Musculus population is thriving. Glynn described
Musculus distribution, even in his lower quadrats, as "erratic. [Tlhe species
sometimes occurred by the hundreds in some thalli and was altogether absent
from others only two to three feet away". Our sampling in the Endocladia zone
showed the opposite. Musculus was the most abundant organism in all of our
quadrats, and preliminary sampling in other areas also uncovered large quantities
of this mussel. Glynn also states that Musculus was more abundant in his lower
quadrats. Their high abundance in the middle of the current Endocladia zone is
consistent with this observation.
Like the Lasaea, Musculus has moved downward in the intertidal with E.
muricata. Resampling in Glynnâ€™s original sites found an average of only 186
individuals per 20x20cm quadrat as compared with 6485 in the middle of the
current zone.
In Glynn (1965), it is clear that Balanus glandula was a co-dominate
organism in the Endocladia zone. However, Balanus abundance has decreased,
and it is qualitatively no longer an abundant species in the middle of the zone.
