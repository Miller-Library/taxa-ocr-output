The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
ABSTRACT
The red alga, Endocladia muricata, and the barnacle, Balanus glandula,
form a widespread association in the rocky intertidal along the Pacific coast of
North America (Glynn 1965). One portion of that zone, at Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California, was examined to determine its vertical height
and species composition. These measurements were then compared with data
from Glynn (1965). The current upper and lower limits of E. muricata are an
average of 1.20 and 1.05 feet lower respectively than they were in 1965. At three of
Glynnâ€™s study sites, replicate 5x5 cm quadrats were sampled in the middle of the
current Endocladia zone, taking care to duplicate as many of Glynn's original
quadrat characteristics as possible. Analysis of algal biomass showed no
significant change in the abundance of E. muricata in these areas. The species
composition of the assemblage has changed little, but there has been a significant
change in the relative abundances of species. Abundance of the bivalve,
Musculus sp., has increased significantly, while that of the barnacle, B. glandula,
has decreased. These findings indicate that much of the E. muricata animal
community has moved downward along with the algal cover, but that the
abundance of a few predominate species within this community has changed.
These data provide a base for future quantitative studies of temporal change in
the E. muricata zone and may aid in evaluating the effects of environmental
change on intertidal habitats.
