The Endocladia Zone

IX respectively. At each site, two 5x5 cm quadrats were sampled and identified as
XA and XB, where x corresponds to Glynn's quadrat number.
We chose to use 5x5 cm quadrats for three reasons. First of all, preliminary
sampling at alternate sites showed that the animals living within the Endocladia
zone are small enough to be abundant within a 5x5 cm square. Secondly, using
5x5 cm quadrats allowed us to take replicate samples at each of Glynn's sites,
accounting for the small scale variation within sites.
Thirdly, because of this small scale variability in animal life in the intertidal zone,
it was important to imitate the physical characteristics and orientation of Glynn's
original quadrats as closely as possible. Using 5x5 cm - instead of 20x20 cm-
quadrats made it easier to find sample areas near Glynn’s originals that shared his
quadrat's physical characteristics.
Each of our 5x5 cm quadrats was placed haphazardly in what was
qualitatively determined to be the vertical center of the current Endocladia zone.
All sites were within Im horizontally of Glynn’s sample site. Duplicating the
physical characteristics of Glynn’s quadrats was given priority over placing
quadrats in the exact middle of the Endocladia zone.
We removed all plants, animals, and sandy sediments from the rock
within our quadrats. To keep mobile animals from leavirig the sample site, all
large tufts of algae were cut off immediately after placing the quadrat. Äfter this
initial cut, we marked the edges of our quadrats so that they could be relocated if
shifting occurred during sampling. We used scalpels, pipets, and dentist tools to
