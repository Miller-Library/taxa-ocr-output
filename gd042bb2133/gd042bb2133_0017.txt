Figure 1. Location of 16 quadrat sites in the study area at the Hopkins Marine
Station (January 16, 1962) (Glynn 1965).
Figure 2. The average upper and lower limits of the 1965 and 1996 Endocladia
Balanus association. Average height is measured in feet above mean lower
low water level. The error bars are + one standard error of the mean.
Figure 3. A: The vertical position of 14 site locations in the EndocladiaÂ¬
Balanus association. The Roman numerals indicate the sample site at which
the upper and lower measurements were taken. The Arabic numerals below
quadrats II, III, and IX show the heights of the 5x5cm sample plots taken at
those locations. The heights are displayed in feet above mean lower low
water level.
B: The vertical position in the intertidal zone of 16 quadrats taken in the
Endocladia-Balanus association in 1962. Quadrat numbers are indicated by
Roman numerals, while Arabic numerals show the heights of the centers of
the quadrats in feet above mean lower low water level. The arrows above
and below each quadrat point out the upper and lower limits of the
Endocladia-Balanus belt at each site. (Glynn 1965)
Figure 4. 1965 and 1996 abundances of Lasaea cistula and Musculus sp.. Bar
height shows animal count averaged over quadrats II, III, and IX. Data from
1965 are represented by the dark bar; data from 1996 are represented by the
light bar. Counts are animals per 20x20cm sampling area. The error bars are +
one standard error of the mean.
