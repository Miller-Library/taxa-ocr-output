The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
Resampling of Glynn’s original quadrat sites found Balanus abundances close to
Glynn’s (- 120 per 400 cm’, Gilman and Sagarin unpublished). These data suggest
that Balanus has remained at its original tidal height while the Endocladia zone
has moved down.
The average number of syllids per 20x20cm quadrat was similar in 1965 and
1996. This consistency, combined with the fact that resampling of Glynn's
quadrats found an average of zero syllids per 20x20cm quadrat, suggests that the
syllids have moved down with the Endocladia zone. Syllids rely on the
Endocladia cover to avoid desiccation (Glynn 1965), so it is expected that they
would move down in the intertidal with the algal cover. Glynn (1965) observed
that the center of the syllid population was below the 1965 lower limit of E.
muricata. The fact that our abundance counts are similar to Glynn’s suggests that
the center of the syllid population remains below the lower limit of E. muricata.
Mytilus californianus was one of the most abundant species in Glynn’s
counts, but was quite rare in ours. This change, while not statistically significant,
may have biological implications. Glynn (1965) noted that the Mytilis population
was best developed below the lower limit of the Endocladia zone. Our data
suggest that this may still be true, and that perhaps most of the current Mytilus
population is still located lower than the Endocladia zone.
Future Work
We have compared 1965 and 1996 Endocladia zone heights and species
composition at three of Glynn’s sample sites. The difference between 1965 and
1996 was not statistically significant for most individual species. However, the
