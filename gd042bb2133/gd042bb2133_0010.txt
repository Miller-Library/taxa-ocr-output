The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
living on bare rocks face temperatures that are 8° C higher than those in E.
muricata cover (Glynn 1965) and presumably seek shelter among fronds of E.
muricata (Glynn 1965). This protective function of E. muricata may explain why
most of the species found in the 1965 Endocladia zone are still present. Most of
the organisms living in E. muricata are better equipped to withstand prolonged
submersion than prolonged exposure to the atmosphere, making it more
advantageous for them to move down to lower tidal heights than to try to
survive atmospheric conditions without E. muricata cover (Glynn 1965).
While the majority of the species present in the 1965 Endocladia zone are
still found in the zone today, their relative abundances have changed. Lasaea
cistula, the most abundant species in 1965, is still one of the most abundant
species in the Endocladia zone today. In 1965, Glynn found that Lasaea were
confined to the Endocladia zone: they were abundant within the zone, but their
numbers tapered quickly at the upper and lower limits. This trend also seems to
be true today. Recent resampling of Glynn’s actual quadrats, now located at the
upper limit of the Endocladia zone, found approximately 500 Lasaea per 20x20cm
quadrat (Gilman and Sagarin unpublished), while our samples in the middle of
the zone found an average of over 1400 per 20x20cm quadrat.
The large decrease in average Lasaea abundance in the middle of the
Endocladia zone between 1965 and 1996 was not statistically significant. It may,
however, be biologically significant, indicating that Lasaea are not as successful at
a lower intertidal height. This decrease in success may be due to the increase in
