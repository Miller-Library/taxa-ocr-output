The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
INTRODUCTION
The red alga, Endocladia muricata, and the acorn barnacle, Balanus
glandula, are two of the most conspicuous species in the high intertidal zone.
Due to their concurrent abundance, they are referred to as the Endocladia-Balanus
association. This community extends throughout the western coast of North
America, from Alaska to Point Conception (Glynn 1965).
Glynn (1965) conducted an in-depth study of the Endocladia-Balanus
association at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. He documented
both the vertical distribution of this association in the rocky intertidal, as well as
the composition of the community living within the E. muricata. Glynn (1965)
sampled sixteen 20x20 cm quadrats located in the center of the Endocladia zone,
identifying and counting the species present. In addition, he permanently
marked the locations of his sample sites with pegs, making a repeat study
possible.
The detail of Glynn (1965), the fact that it has been over thirty years since
his data were taken, and the availability of his sites for resampling, all make his
study an excellent baseline from which to assess change in the EndocladiaÂ¬
Balanus community. Resampling at his original sites minimizes the effects of
small scale heterogeneity caused by slight differences in aspect with respect to
water motion, wave action, and sun exposure; the repeatability of his sampling
protocols allowed us to make a valid temporal comparison.
