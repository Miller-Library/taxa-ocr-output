The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
The second category consists of species found in our samples that may or
may not have been present in Glynn's samples. One of these species is a
gastropod, "unidentified gastropods sp.1," which was found in abundance in our
samples (see Appendix 1). While Glynn also recorded "unidentified gastropods,
there is no way to determine whether his unidentified gastropods were the same
as ours, or if ours is a new species that was not present in 1965.
The third category of species contains those found in our samples for
which Glynn recorded only presence or absence. These species include several
algal species, mites, and bryozoans.
Finally, comparisons were not made on species found both in zero
abundance in our samples and in an abundance of fewer than 8 in Glynn's. Our
quadrat was one-sixteenth the size of Glynn's, and with two of our quadrats
sampled for each of Glynn's, a 1965 count of fewer than 8 is equivalent to fewer
than one organism in the pooled total of our two quadrats. Thus, absence from
our sample could have been due to sampling error or true absence from the
assemblage. These species include Emplectonema gracile, Perinereis monterea,
and Cyanoplax dentiens.
DISCUSSION
Vertical Distribution
It is possible that the downward shift in vertical distribution of the
Endocladia zone is due to an increase in the range of ambient temperature
extremes. Temperature readings from the United States Naval Air Facility,
Monterey (3.5 miles from Hopkins Marine Station and 1.25 miles inland) show
