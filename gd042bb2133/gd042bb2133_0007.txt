The Endocladia Zone

still abundant in the center of the Endocladia zone today, but Musculus sp. is
now the organism in greatest abundance (Fig. 4).
Three of the four most abundant species are the same for 1965 and 1996:
Lasaea cistula, Littorina spp., and syllids (Table 1). However, the average number
of Lasaea cistula and Littorina spp. per 400 cm’ quadrat were considerably different
between 1965 and today.
Musculus sp. is the most abundant organism in our samples, but was not
one of the most abundant animals in Glynn’s quadrats. Similarly, Mytilus
californianus was the third most abundant species in Glynn's samples, but was
quite rare in ours.
The average number of individuals per 400 cm’ in 1965 and 1996 is
different for each of the 20 species found in the Endocladia zone (Table 2).
However, the increase in the abundance of Musculus sp. and the decrease in B.
glandula are the only statistically significant changes between 1965 and 1996
(p=.01; p=.04 respectively). On average, there are 6349 more Musculus sp. and 95
fewer Balanus glandula per 400 cm’ quadrat today than in 1965.
Problem Species
There were several species for which no comparisons were made. These
species fall into four categories. The first category contains those species that were
counted in our samples, but were not included in Glynn’s counts, presumably
because they are difficult to identify and sample accurately. These species include
nematodes, copepods, and ostracods.
