The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
that the average maximum temperature for 1948 to 1959 and 1945 was 15.94°C
(Glynn 1965). For the same relative time period prior to our study (excluding
1980), the average maximum was 2.74°C higher; the average minimum was .39°(
lower.
When E. muricata is not covered by water, it is subject to increased
ultraviolet radiation and temperature stress, making it susceptible to bleaching
and desiccation. Extreme atmospheric conditions limit the amount of time that
E. muricata can tolerate being exposed, which in turn, limits its vertical
distribution. By moving downward in the intertidal, the upper limit of the
Endocladia zone is submerged a greater percentage of time, presumably reducing
the stress of increased atmospheric extremes.
Comparison of average water temperature for the five years prior to the
1965 and 1996 studies also show a 1.5°C increase in average maximum
temperature. However, Glynn (1965) found that E. muricata did not change its
vertical height between seasons, despite varying water temperatures (Glynn 1965).
The change in water temperature may have played a role in the Endocladia zone
shift, but is probably not as significant as the changes in ambient temperature
extrêmes. Further physiological and ecological experiments are needed to verify
this explanation.
Species Composition
Most of the organisms living in the Endocladia zone are marine. Like E.
muricata, they are vulnerable when exposed to air, especially when atmospheric
conditions, such as temperature and wind, are extreme (Glynn 1965). Organisms
