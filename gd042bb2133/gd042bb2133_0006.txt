The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
RESULTS
Vertical Distribution
The 1996 upper limit of the Endocladia zone is an average of 1.20 ft lower
than in 1965; the lower limit is an average of 1.05 ft lower (Fig. 2). In both 1965
and 1996, there is clear between-site heterogeneity (Fig. 3). There is no strong
correlation between 1965 and 1996 upper and lower limits of E. muricata at
individual sites. One of Glynn’s lowest sites, LI, is now one of the highest (Fig. 3).
Species Composition
Three plant species and 21 animal taxa were found in our samples. Most
animals were extremely small, measuring less than 1 mm in length. Aside from
animals that had been dislodged during sampling, animals were associated
directly with fronds of E. muricata. The greatest density of organisms was located
in the holdfasts of E. muricata. This was also the only region in which
polychaetes were found. Organisms were found in a broad range of abundances:
average counts varied from 1 to nearly 6500 per 400 cm’ area.
The 1996 dry weights of E. muricata and Mastocarpus papillatus, 23040 mg
and 4133 mg per 400 cm’ quadrat respectively, are not significantly different from
1965 (t-test, p=0.33; t-test, p=0.83).
The overall animal composition of the current Endocladia assemblage is
significantly different from the 1965 assemblage (x’= 10634.41, p ««.001). The
most abundant species in the center of the Endocladia zone in 1965, Lasaea cistula,
is no longer the most prevalent species in the Endocladia zone. Lasaea cistula is
