The Endocladia Zone
Erin Leydig and Ashley Simons
We examined two different aspects of long term change in the Endocladig-
Balanus association at Hopkins Marine Station: changes in the vertical
distribution of the Endocladia zone and changes in species composition of the
assemblage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Determination of Vertical Distribution
Glynn (1965) measured the upper and lower vertical limits of the
Endocladia zone at 16 quadrat sites in the intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station
(Fig. 1). Fourteen of these original sites were relocated using Glynn's markers (or
scars from these markers) and Glynn's photograph of his study site (Fig. 1). A
surveyor’s transit and stadia rod were used to measure the current average upper
and average lower limits of the Endocladia zone at each of these relocated sites.
These average limits were estimated by eye and were within 1 to 2 m of Glynn's
sample sites. Height was measured relative to a U.S.G.S. brass peg (3.82 ft above
mean lower low water level).
Glynn also measured the height of his quadrat sites, which were in the
middle of the Endocladia zone. At three of Glynn's quadrats, we remeasured the
height of his quadrat markers. We also measured the height of our sample
quadrats, which were placed in the middle of the current Endocladia zone.
Determination of Species Composition
During lower low tides on May 4th, 5th, and 13th, 1996, samples were taken
in the middle of the current E. muricata zone at Glynn’s quadrat sites, II, III, and
