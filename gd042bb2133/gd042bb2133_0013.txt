The Endocladia Zone

change in overall composition of the assemblage indicates that the individual
species changes are probably biological significant. In order to determine the
extent of such biological significance, future work should include resampling of
the current Endocladia zone at additional Glynn study sites and at more replicate
quadrats within each site. The lack of significant change in individual species
abundance was probably due to large standard errors on our mean counts. These
errors are caused by small sample size and the inherent heterogeneity of the
intertidal environment. The only way to counteract this error would be to
increase sample sizes.
The data we have collected can be used as a baseline for later studies
following up on further change in the Endocladia zone. These data will also be
useful in evaluating what effect environmental changes, such as increases in
ambient temperature, are having on the species living in the intertidal zone.
