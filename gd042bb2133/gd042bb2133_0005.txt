clear the quadrats. All material taken from each sample site was placed in a
separate, high-sided, plastic container filled with sea water.
Plastic containers holding the samples taken from the field were brought to
a lab sea table and placed in a bucket with sea water running through it. This sea
water bath maintained the samples close to ambient sea water temperature. The
containers were kept open for much of the day and new sea water was
occasionally added to the sample containers to keep them from becoming anoxic.
We examined each sample under a dissecting microscope, picking out all
the living organisms from the E. muricata with forceps and pipets. Animals were
identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (Baxter and Watanabe pers.
com., Hartman 1968, Smith and Carlton 1975) and preserved in 70% alcohol.
Counts for each group were recorded as individual animals were found. We
included animals killed during sampling or storing in the group counts.
However, we did not count fragments of animals.
All algae in our samples was sorted and dried to constant weight at 60°C.
Each 5x5 cm quadrat took an average of four full days to sort.
Statistical Analysis of Data
Individual animal counts and algal dry weights for our quadrats were
standardized to a per 400 cm’ basis. Data from replicate 5x5 cm quadrats were
averaged for comparison to corresponding Glynn quadrats. Overall changes in
the relative abundance of species was analyzed using a chi-squared test. Species
whose expected values were less than 5 were pooled into one category for this
analysis. Changes in individual species abundance were analyzed using t-tests.
