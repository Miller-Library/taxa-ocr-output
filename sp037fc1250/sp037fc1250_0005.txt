marked and placed in the tidepool site one week before

Results
Movements of the subtidal and intertidal populations
are given in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. All estimates
are minimal for only net displacement in a straight line
was measured. For the intertidal animals, movement from
1900-2300 hrs was determined by dividing the total movement d
during the four-hour period by 4 and plotting-it in 4 hourly
increments. Further observatins were not possible because
of rough surge.
During the 24-hour surveys of activity, 3 of the 11
subtidal individuals exhibited homing, returning before
sunrise to the positions and orientations noted at the
initiation of the watch. Intertidally, 3 of the 15 marked
chitons homed with the approach of low tide at the end of
the complete 25-hour tidal cycle.
TAXONOMY
Consistent differences in size and coloration are
found between intertidal and subtidal populations of
Tonicella lineata. Barnes (1972) voiced the suspicion
that a taxanomic differentiation between subtidal and inter-
tidal communities exists in Oregon and Washington, and
