tracts, corresponds to the scarcity of greens subtidally
and browns intertidally in the sites studie. Brown algae
were also scarce subtidally, and absent from the gut contents
of subtidal animals.
Diatoms averaged about 10% of the gut contents in
all habitats studied. Microscopic observation reveals fewer
intact, more "digested" diatoms in the posterior portions
of the gut. As diatoms are common epiphytes on coralline
algae, they may be passively ingested with the corallines
and subsequently utilized as a food source.
Coralline algae, due to the considerable calcium
carbonate content, would appear to providé a poor source
of nutrition per bulk weight. However, they are abundant
and grazing competition is probably low.
The findings that activity in Tonicella lineata
e
conforms to a phéteporiodie cycle subtidally and a tidal
cycle intertidally are noteworthy. Nocturnal activity
subtidally would be advantageous in avoiding predators with
vision. Although such predators have not been demonstrated
for this chiton, the close visual conformity that T. lineata
displays with its coralline substrate strongly suggests
such a possibility. Likewise, decreased activity with
low tide may be advantageous in the intertidal, for
heightened activity in an aerial environment would result
in respiratory inefficiency (B. Robbins, 1974) and increased
exposure to destication.
