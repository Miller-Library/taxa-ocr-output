Figure 6 illustrates the relations between "fullness"
of the anterior digestive tract and time of day. Subtidal
specimens were fuller at night. No consistent variation
in the "fullness" of intertidal animals with time of day
was observed.
ACTIVITY
Materials and Methods
Activity patterns were investigated in the field
on subtidal and intertidal populations over a 24-hour
period. In the subtidal survey, two separate rock faces
with algal distributions conforming to that listed in
Table i and bearing a combined total of 11 Tonicella lineata,
were chosen. Positions of all animals were recorded at
4-hour intervals, using a 50cm x 50cm quadrat frame.
Intertidally, the tidepool habitat described previously
was chosen for study. Specimens were marked with numbered
witte
squares of waterproof paper aattached to the valves using
an acrylic glue (Tm "Zip-Grip 10", Devcon Corp., Danvers,
Mass.). Fifteen specimens were observed hourly, tide
permitting, throughout a 24-hour period. Ten of these were
