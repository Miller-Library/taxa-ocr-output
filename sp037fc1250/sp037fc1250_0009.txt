Diet, Activity and Feeding
in Tonicella lineata
SUMMARY
1. Tonicella lineata characteristically occurs
on a coralline algal substratum.
2. Coralline algae comprise an average of more
than 50% of its diet.
3. Subtidally, Tonicella lineata exhibits
increased activity nocturnally. Intertidally,
heightened activity conicides with periods of
high water.
4. Indications of homing behavior were observed in
some intertidal and subtidal individuals.
5. Intertidal and subtidal populations of Tonicella
lineata differ in body size, color, activity pattern,
and number of valve notches.
