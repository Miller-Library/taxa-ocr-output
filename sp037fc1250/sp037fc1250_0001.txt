Diet, Activity and Feeding
in Tonicella lineata
INTRODUCTION
Tonicella lineata (Wood, 1815) is a common and
distinctive chiton of the Pacific coast. In western
North America it extends from the Aleutian Islands to
San Diego, California and is also relatively abundant
in Northern Japan (Burghardt and Burghardt, 1969).
In the area of Monterey Bay, California, it ranges from
intertidal pools to 65m depth (Smith and Gordon, 1948.
p. 205). Such a wide distribution in latitude and depth
implies exposure to a varied spectrum of physital and
biological factors. However, the microhabitat in which
Tonicella lineata and other species of Tonicella are found
is surprisingly narrow, for this genus appears to require
the presence of coralline algae, either crustose or
erect, as a substratum (Barnes, 1972, and Yakovleva, 1952).
The larvae of Tonicella lineata settle only if
presented with a coralline algal substratum (Barnes, 1972).
Also, this species displays a disruptive dorsal coloration
which blends well with the surface of coralline algae.
offering an excellent defense against visual predation.
In view of this seeming dependence on coralline
algae, it has been proposed (Barnes, 1972), but not
supported with quantitative data, that corallines are
used by Tonicella as food. The present report concerns
