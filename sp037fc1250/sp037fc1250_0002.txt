the diet of Tonicella lineata and the possible existence
of activity and feeding patterns. A distinction between
intertidal and subtidal populations is also discussed.
DIET INVESTIGATION
Materials and Methods
Specimens were collect√©d at Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove, California, from three relatively distinct habitats:
a high intertidal tidepool (at approximately the +4 ft tidal
level); a low intertidal region characterized by an
abundance of Phyllospadix scouleri Hooker; and subtidal rocks
at depths of 6 to 10m within the canopy of Macrocystis
pyrifera (Linnegus) C.A.Agardh. A list of coralline and
other algae found in each habitat is provided in Table 1.
Identifications were verified by Dr. Isabella Abbottesta Un
Coralline algae predominate in each region.
A total of 25 Tonicella lineata (6 tidepool, il inter-
tidal and 8 subtidal) were collected at varying times
throughout the day-night and tidal cycles. Specimens
were preserved immediately in a solution of 10% buffered
formaldehyde in sea water.
The contentgof the entire digestive tract, from
stomach to anus, of each animal was subjected to micro-
scopic examination, and a visual estimate was made of the
