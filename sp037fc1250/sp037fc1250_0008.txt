Diet, Activity and Feeding

in Tonicella lineata
The correspondence of relative "fullness" of the
anterior digestive tract in subtidal specimens with the
observed cyclic activity patterns suggests,asexpected
that increased activity is associated with increased feeding.
Intertidally, the gut "fullness" data does not support a
similar conclusion.
Subtidal individuals of T. lineata were generally
smaller and differently colored than those from the inter-
tidal; they had fewer valve notches, and a somewhat
different activity pattern. Whether these represent tax-
onomic, ecological, or age differences in the two
populations is unclear. Experiments in which members of
the two populations are transplanted and juxtaposed might
be helpful in clarifying this question.
