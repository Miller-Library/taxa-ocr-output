various constituents of biologic and inanimate origin.
Along withgut content determinations, the relative
fullness of the anterior digestive tract was recorded
for all specimens. Three cat√©gories were employed.
These are: "full" (greater than 70% of the digestive
tract filled with ingested material), "moderate fullness"
(30-70% filled); and "empty" (less than 30% of the digestive
tract containing ingested matter).
Results
The percentages of the identifiable gut content con-
stituents in animals from each habitat are presented in
Figs. 1-3. Coralline algae always represented the major
food ingested. It was not possible to distinguish between
species of coralline algae on the basis of fragments in
the gut for the rasping of the radula removes cell layers
and not whole regions of the algal thallus, hindering
identification.
The category, "Detritus and Substrate", was
predominantly minerah material, Some efthiswas
almost certainly Caco, from corallines (chalky white grains
dissolving with production of gas on treatment with 1% HCI).
Other material in this category appeared to be decomposed
plant or animal tissue, but no clear cell structure was
observed. In any event, the percentage of coralline algae
