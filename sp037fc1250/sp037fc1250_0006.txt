Diet, Activity and Feeding
P. Demopulos
in Tonicella lineata
indicated that further work was in progress relating to
this question.
Sex, length and width measurements, valve and girdle
coloration, and numbers of anterior and posterior valve
notches were recorded for 36 specimens (6 subtidal and 30
intertidal, including tidepool). Aant difference
Godens 151
(p(0.2) in the total number of valve notches was found.
Intertidal animals consistently exhibited a greater sum
of anterior andeposterior notches.
Subtidal specimens are typically smaller (i to 2 cm
in length) with purple lines on the girdle, and lavender
and pink hues closely matching th coralline substrate.
Intertidal individuals have darker valve and mantle
coloration and yellow lines on the girdle, ranging 2 to
4 cm in length.
DISCUSSION
Coralline algae clearly comprise the majority of
material ingested by Tonicella lineata; the narrowness
of microhabitat exhibited in the field is reflected in the
limited number of algal genera and species ingested
(see Figs. 1-3 and Table 1). It is nonetheless surprising
that no red algae other than coralline algae were ingested
by subtidal specimens, for reds such as Rhodymenia spp.
were available. The absence of green algae in the guts
of subtidal animals and brown algae in Uhteptidal digestive
