leterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
the dry 14°0 darkroom.
A relative humidity of 50% was sufficient stimulus to induce
burrowing (Figure 7), presumably to avoid desiccation. The satura¬
tion defecit at 14°0 and 50% humidity is 6.0, which is slightly
greater than that at 60%. Animals at 14° and 60 humidity may be
facing a similar desiccation threat, and respond to the light
positively as P. scaber was seen to do. This is consistent with
the observation that several animals which had demonstrated a random
or photonegative response when first tested would exhibit a definite
photopositive response after acclimation in the darkroom.
It would be an adaptive advantage for A. perconvexus to show
a photopositive response under desiccation stress when burrowed in
the sand. To move to a more favorable microhabitat through the sand
would be a difficult process, and the animal would be exposed to
the desiccating influences for a greater period of time than it would
if it moved along the sand surface, even though it would then be
exposed to light. The animal can move more quickly along the sand
surface, and would be exposed to desiccation for a shorter period
in moving to an area of greater moisture content. This behavioral
adaptation appears to explain the nature of the observed photo-
positive responses in the laboratory.
The retention of the same 24 hour periodicity in activity in
a laboratory population of A. perconvexus as seen in the field is
not sufficient evidence for the presence of an endogenous rhythm.
though it may be suggestive of one, even after a 3 week period.
