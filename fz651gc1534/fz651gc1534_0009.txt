Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
addition, a significant photopositive response was observed during
daytime tests after the animals had been acclimated for 24 hours
in the darkroom (p.Ol in a chi square test. Animals taken from
the environment and tested immediately show a random response to
light (p=.05 in a chi square test). The controls of May 17 and 18
show no significant responses when the light was off (p.9 and
p.25 respectively in a chi square test). The second phototropism
experiment (Figure 5) also indicates a photopositive response (p
.01
in a chi square test) while the unlighted control indicates a
random response (p.25 in a chi square test).
As the wide 95% confidence intervals indicate, the sample size
in the light intensity threshold experiment was quite small
(Figure 6). Although a trend can be seen in the generally increasing
responses of the animals towards light as the intensity decreased.
no statistically significant threshold can be established for the
response. Significant differences are seen after 5 minutes between
the response at 0.02 ft. candle and 0.2 ft. candle, and after 10
minutes between the response at 0.02 ft. candle and 0.1 ft. candle.
It appeared that animals started responding positively to light at
levels below 0.1 ft. candle, though this can't be verified statisÂ¬
tically with this sample size.
A significant correlation between relative humidity and burrowing
was clearly evident (Figure 7). The animals burrow significantly
more at 50% than at 100, as the 95% confidence intervals indicate.
The response is more pronounced after 60 minutes exposure to the
