Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
to a different light regime, for there were no simulated periods of
dusk and dawn. It may also be true that the duration of the
artificial light stimulus (7 days) was too short to permanently
entrain them. This seems unlikely, however, particularly since
the animals were in constant darkness for 6 days prior to the intro
introduction of the reversed light regime.
Endogenous factors appear to be the primary stimuli determining
the activity patterns of A. perconvexus. Light can overcome the
endogenous factors to become the primary stimulus under the
artificial conditions seen here in the laboratory. The influence
of the light is lost quickly once the animal is again in constant
darkness. The more powerful endogenous rhythm overcomes the effect
of light in determining activity, and the natural activity cycle
of the animal is restored.
