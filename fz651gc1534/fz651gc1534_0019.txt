Figure 1. Pattern of activity for A. perconvexus in the field on
April 26.
Figure 2. Pattern of activity for A, perconvexus in the field on
May 28.
Figure 3. Patterns of activity for A. perconvexus in the field
(lower series of graphs) with corresponding environmental
factors (upper'series of graphs. Environmental factors of
temperature (—), relative humidity (—--), and saturation
defecit (—:) are represented. The scales for the vertical
axes on the upper graphs are temperature in degrees Celsius
(left vertical, large numbers), relative humidity in percent
(left vertical, small numbers), and saturation defecit
(right vertical). The successive nights under observation
were: April 30 (I), May 1 (II), and May 2 (III).
Figure 4. Phototropic response in A. perconvexus. Vertical
axes represent the number of responses.
Figure 5. Phototropic response in A. perconvexus.
Figure 6. Percent positive responses to light in A. perconvexus
at varying light intensities. Included are the 95%
confidence intervals.
Figure 7. Burrowing response in A. perconvexus at 2 different
relative humidities. 50%-Low, 100%-High.
