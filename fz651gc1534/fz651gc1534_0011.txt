leterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
activity pattern observed in A. perconvexus is a response to
exogenous environmental cues or is due to endogenous influences.
A definite pattern of nocturnal activity is exhibited by A.
perconvexus (Figures 1, 2, and 3). This is a useful adaptation in
view of the animal's moisture requirements. The animal is less
exposed to desiccation since relative humidities are greater at
night with the lower temperatures. However there is no correlation
between activity and fluctuations in temperature and humidity
(Figure 3). A. perconvexus was never observed active when the
saturation defecit exceeded 2.5. The threat of desiccation becomes
greater as saturation defecit increases. No significant correlation
between activity and the saturation defecit was noted. As data for
day III in Figure 3 indicate, activity had generally ceased by 0600
although the saturation defecit was still a very favorable 0.10.
Temperature and humidity are unreliable cues for activity because
their daily cycles are irregular. Saturation defecit, being a
function of both temperature and humidity, might not be a reliable
stimulus either. These factors can thus be eliminated as stimuli
for the initiation and cessation of activity.
Field observations suggest that light is the stimulus to which
the animal responds. The animal was never seen active before sunset.
and only isolated individuals were detected after sunrise. Light
would be a very reliable stimulus for A. perconvexus to respond
to because of the regularity of the daily light cycle.
The nightly increases in relative humidity and decreases in
