Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
environment.
Observations of the activity of A. perconvexus by this author
have suggested that it leaves its daytime burrows at night to actively
move about on the sand surface. The animal is thus behaviorally
protected from the desiccating influences of the lower daytime
humidities by remaining in burrows during the daylight hours.
The determinant factors for the activity of A. perconvexus may
be either exogenous or endogenous. The stimulus for activity could
be an environmental cue or may be related to the internal physiology
of the animal. Studies on the terrestrial isopod Oniscus asellus
have shown that its endogenous diurnal activity patterns are correlated
with the alternating light-dark cycle, and not with fluctuations in
temperature and humidity (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1961). The light-dark
cycle is a more regular cycle for an organism to be synchronized with.
An endogenous rhythm would be a useful adaptation for an isopod which
might have no other means to obtain information about external
conditions which might themselves be acting as stimuli for its activity
patterns (Enright, 1970). Such a mechanism would preclude activity
before conditions were favorable. This would substancially benefit
A. perconvexus.
The present experiments were conducted from April to June, 1973.
with the objective of ellucidating the major factors which determine
the activity patterns of the sand beach isopod, Alloniscus perconvexus.
