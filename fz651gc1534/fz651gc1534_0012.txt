terminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
temperature and saturation defecit appear to be integrally related
to the light-dark cycle in establishing the activity pattern of
A. perconvexus. The animal profits from the nightly moisture
conditions while it also has a reliable stimulus to define its active
periods. The nature of the effect of light on A. perconvexus is
uncertain, for the animals may be responding to light directly as
an exogenous stimulus, or light may be the entraining agent for an
endogenous rhythm.
The definite photopositive response of A. perconvexus (Figures
5 and 6) is seen only in those animals which had previously been
acclimated to the 14Â°0 darkroom. Those tested directly from the
field exhibited a random response. Though statistically insignifi-
cant, there was an apparent trend towards an increased positive
response to light at lower light levels (Figure 6). These responses
could indicate that A. perconvexus is responding to low light levels
as a stimulus for its emergence at night. This could, however, be
a response to some cue besides light.
The relative humidity in the darkroom where the experiments
were conducted was 60%, with a saturation defecit of 4.8. This
defecit is considerably higher than the maximum level of 2.5 seen
during field activity. Cloudsley-Thompson (Cloudsley-Thompson,
1958) found that Porcellio scaber becomes photopositive when in
danger of desiccation. This response allows them to relieve the
moisture stress by moving towards a more favorable habitat. A.
perconvexus could conceivably be exhibiting the same behavior in
