Determinants of Activit
in A. perconvexu
NTRODUCTION
It has been theorized that the terrestrial isopod crustaceans of
the suborder Oniscoidea represent forms which have migrated from the
ocean and have thus acquired terrestrial habitats (Miller, 1938).
They may represent a transitional stage in the evolutionary movement
of fauna from the sea onto the land.
There is considerable variance between the different Oniscoidean
species and the degree of their adaptation to the land environment.
One species, Alloniscus perconvexus, occupies the upper littoral
zones of the sandy beach, above the high tide level (Ricketts and
Calvin, 1968). It is generally burrowed in the sand at a depth of 7
to 12 cm (Brusca, 1966). Its distribution on the beach is limited
below by the high tide level and above by the degree of moisture in
the sand (Hainsworth, 1972). Water relations are of the greatest
importance in determining the local distribution of isopods on land
(Miller, 1938). A. perconvexus is not adapted to complete submergence
and will drown in seawater (Ricketts and Calvin, 1968).
A. perconvexus respires primarily through its gill surfaces,
though some special air chambers have been noted at the edges of the
exopodites which may function as accessory respiratory organs (Miller,
1938). The gill surfaces must be kept moist if they are to function
effectively. A. perconvexus consequently requires a habitat of
greater moisture content than Porcellio scaber and other terrestrial
Oniscoideans. This shows a lesser degree of adaptation to the land
