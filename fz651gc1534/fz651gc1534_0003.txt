Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
METHODS
This investigation was based on field observations and laboratory
studies. The population of Alloniscus perconvexus studied was found
on the upper portion of the northeast facing sandy beach between Pt.
Cabrillo and Pt. Alones on Monterey Bay, California.
Field Studies
Field studies of the activity patterns of A. perconvexus were
conducted using 26 pitfall traps consisting of plastic cups (diameter
of 8 cm) buried in the sand and flush with the surface. These traps
were placed 0.5 to 1.0 m apart, and 5 cm from any rocks or deposits
of wrack. The study region was 7 m square. Traps were examined at
hourly intervals at night during April and May. Collected animals
were immediately released at least 1.5 m from any trap, and those
caught in any one trap were not all released in the same place. This
reduced the probability of catching the animals consistently in the
same trap while still keeping them in the same local area.
Initially a 24 hour observation period was conducted to establish
the overall pattern of activity in the field. This was followed by
observations during the active night periods on 3 successive evenings,
during which the environmental factors of air temperature and relative
humidity weremonitored at hourly intervals. Temperature was measured
with a tele-thermometer and humidity with a Honeywell relative humidity
indicator. Wind speed was negligible on all 3 nights and was not
recorded. A second 24 hour observation was conducted i month later
