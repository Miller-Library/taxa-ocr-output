shortly before their natural activity would begin, and placed into the
dark chamber for a short acclimation period. The light was turned on
and the opening between the two chambers was uncovered. The number
of animals seen in the lighted chamber was noted after 5 and 10
minute intervals, and the procedure was repeated at decreasing light
intensities. The experiment was repeated the next evening with
different animals.
Experiments to study the effects of relative humidity on the
burrowing response of A. perconvexus were conducted in covered humidity
chambers consisting of glass dishes containing 2.5 cm of sand. Small
crucibles containing distilled water and calcium chloride desiccant
were used to produce relative humidities of 100% and 50% respectively,
The chambers were placed in the 14Â°0 darkroom. Ten animals, collected
at night, were placed in each chamber after a short acclimation period.
The covered chambers were examined after 30 and 60 minute intervals
to determine the number of burrowed isopods.
Studies to detail activity patterns were conducted on a laboratory
population of 50 individuals established in constant darkness under
constant conditions. The population was maintained in an open plastic
tub measuring 30x17x10 cm and containing 5 cm of sand. Phyllospadix
wrack was used as a food source, and was replaced periodically as it
dried out. Small amounts of water were added as needed when the sand
became dry.
The isopods for the laboratory population were collected from
beneath rocks on the beach on the afternoon of May 7, and were placed
