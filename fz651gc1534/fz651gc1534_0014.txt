Jeterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
Some unknown factor in the environment may be effectively acting
as a stimulus to which the animals are responding. Light couldn't
be the factor because the only light received was from brief exposure
to the masked flashlight at regular intervals. As the 5 control
animals indicated, the flashlight apparently had no influence on
their activity; they followed the same 24 hour periodicity though
they were undisturbed for 6 days. The controls further indicated
that individual isopods become active independent of other isopods.
Activity isn't initiated by a single individual.
No evidence of a spontaneous frequency, or free running period
as defined by Pittendrigh (Aschoff, 1960), is seen, other than the
24 hour period observed in A. perconvexus. Seven periods of obser-
vation under constant conditions are required before spontaneous
frequency can be mentioned relative to an animal's activity pattern
(Aschoff, 1960). A. perconvexus has followed the same periodicity
in its activity for a 3 week period in constant conditions. This
periodicity is in synchrony with the 24 hour light-dark cycle.
This suggests that A. perconvexus has a spontaneous frequency of
24 hours.
After a 7 day entrainment period to a reversed light-dark
cycle, the population exhibits the expected acquired activity
pattern, which is in synchrony with the reversed light regime.
on the first day in constant darkness. The activity pattern then
gradually shifts forward each day until it becomes fixed on the
pattern already seen in the laboratory and in the field. The dark
