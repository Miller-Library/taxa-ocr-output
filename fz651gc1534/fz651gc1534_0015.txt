chamber was effectively shielded from light, as the test with the
photographic paper indicated (none had been exposed by light after
different periods in the chamber). The brief exposure to the masked
flashlight in the earlier control seemed to have no effect on the
animals. Light cannot be the stimulus for the observed change in
the activity pattern after entrainment.
The entrainment process indicated that light is a crucial
determinant of activity in A. perconvexus. No activity was observed
during the lighted periods of the reversed light cycle, although
this was the period of normal field activity. The animal was
responding to the light in the laboratory, as other conditions
remained constant. The 7 day artificial light stimulus wasn't
sufficiently powerful to permanently entrain A. perconvexus, for
once it was removed some stronger stimulus acted to shift the
activity pattern forward to again be synchronized with the normal
light-dark cycle. If this stimulus were some exogenous cue, a
sudden switch in the pattern might be expected, yet here a gradual
change was observed.
There is strong evidence for the presence of an endogenous
rhythm which determines the activity patterns of A. perconvexus.
This is a powerful rhythm and is in synchrony with the periodic
fluctuations in the light-dark cycle. It would appear that the
transitions between light and darkness are the important natural
factors which maintain this rhythm. This would explain the failure
of the artificial light stimulus to permanently entrain the animals
