humidity level than after 30 minutes.
The population kept under constant dark conditions exhibited
no significant difference in activity pattern from the field
population, even after 3 weeks (Figure 8). The peak of activity
fell within the same general range of 2200 to 0200. Although
occasional individuals were observed to be active at times earlier
or later than those observed in the field, it was not a consistent
or common occurrence. Slight irregular changes in the amplitude of
activity were observed. A. perconvexus retained its 24 hour activity
pattern throughout the entire 3 week period.
The second laboratory population acquired a new activity
pattern, quite different from that observed in the field, during
the 7 day period of entrainment to the reversed light regime. After
the first period in constant darkness, both the overall period of
activity and the time of peak activity shifted forward 2 to 3 hours
each period on successive days until the peak activity was once
again near 2400, where it remained fixed (Figure 9). After 7 days
of entrainment to the reversed light regime, the activity pattern
of the population shifted to that associated with a normal light
regime after 4 periods in constant darkness. This pattern
corresponds to that observed both in the field and in the other
laboratory population.
