Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
SUMMARY
1. Field studies have indicated that Alloniscus perconvexus,
the sand beach isopod, exhibits a definite pattern of nocturnal
activity, with peak activity between 2200 and 0200.
2. Laboratory studies indicated that A. perconvexus demonstrates
a positive phototropic response when threatened by desiccation.
3. Strong evidence was found for the existence of an endogenous
rhythm in A. perconvexus which is in synchrony with the natural
light-dark cycle. This rhythm seems to determine the activity
patterns of the animal. This is a powerful rhythm, for after 7
days of entrainment to a reversed light regime, the activity
pattern of a population of A. perconvexus shifted within 3 days
to that pattern associated with a normal light cycle once the
population was placed into constant darkness.
