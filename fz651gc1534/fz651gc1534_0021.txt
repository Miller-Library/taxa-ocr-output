ACKNONLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Dr. Malvern Gilmartin, without whose
help and guidance, particularly in the preparation of the manuscript.
this paper would not have been possible. Special thanks are due to
my colleague Robert Barmeyer, whose ideas and suggestions were
invaluable to me throughout this investigation, and also to Raymond
Douglas Davies, Ken Loggins, Jim Messina, and Karen Ransom for the
inspiration they provided me in this project.
