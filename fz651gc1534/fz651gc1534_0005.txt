leterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
third run used animals collected the previous day at 1400, acclimated
for 24 hours, and tested at 1400. The final run used the animals of
the previous test, only they were tested 12 hours later at 0200.
Controls consisted of similar runs conducted with no light source.
A second set of phototropism experiments was conducted using a
sand surface which allowed the animals to burrow normally. A bottom-
less box 37x7.5x10 cm, open at both ends, was placed into a tub
containing sand from the natural habitat. This comprised the experi¬
mental chamber. The sides were imbedded 3 cm into the sand. One half
of the chamber had been darkened inside by black paper, and another
sheet of black paper was placed over that open end. The other end was
oriented towards a dim light of 0.14 ft candle intensity, measured by
a Photovolt light meter. A pitfall trap was placed at either end,
and 20 animals were introduced in the middle of the chamber. After
2 hours the traps were emptied, and the process was repeated for 20
more animals. These experiments were conducted at night in the 1400
darkroom.
A third set of phototropism experiments was conducted in the 14°0
darkroom to determine a possible threshold light intensity at which
the animals might leave their daytime
microhabitats. The experi¬
mental chamber consisted of a box (4OxiOx10 cm) with one half open on
top and the other half completely enclosed as a dark chamber, and
only a small 2.5x2.5 cm opening between the two halves. The same high
intensity light mentioned earlier was placed 5 cm above the end of
the open chamber. Fifteen A. perconvexus were collected at 2030,
