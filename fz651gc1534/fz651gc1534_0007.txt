Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
into the constant darkness conditions at this time. Observation of
activity patterns began on May 9, the criterion for activity again
being presence on the sand surface. Activity was measured by visual
counting with a flashlight masked with several layers of red cellophane.
The observation period lasted a maximum of 15 seconds, and was repeated
at intervals of i to 2 hours throughout the active period. These
observations were continued for a 3 week period, and totalled i1 obser-
vation periods.
A second population of 50 A. perconvexus was established in
laboratory conditions identical to those of the previous population.
This population was maintained undisturbed in constant darkness for
a period of 6 days. After 6 days the population was placed on a
reversed light-dark cycle for a period of 7 days. Illumination was
provided by a standard 60 W light bulb which was turned on at 2000
and off at 0800, this representing an approximate 12 hour shift in
the light-dark cycle. The light was turned off at 0800 on May 31
after 7 days, and the population was kept in constant darkness for
the duration of the research period. Activity levels were monitored
by the same means used in the previous experiment.
A control experiment to evaluate the degree of disturbance due
both
to the flashlight was conducted concurrently with of the previous
experiments. Five individuals were collected at night and placed
in separate glass containers, each containing 2.5 cm of sand and some
Phyllospadix wrack. These dishes were placed under conditions of
constant darkness and were undisturbed by flashlight for a 6 day
