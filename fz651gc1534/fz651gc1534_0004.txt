Laboratory Experiments
Laboratory experiments were conducted at the Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove, California.
Phototropism was studied by applying slight modifications to the
procedure and apparatus described by C. H. Abbott (Abbott, 1918) in
his studies of the responses of Porcellio scaber to light. The light
source consisted of an enclosed box with a slit opening and a high
intensity light bulb (connected to an American Optical voltage
selector). Water in a rectangular container was a coolant for the
light beam passing through the slit (see details in Appendix A).
In this set of experiments, a circular experimental grid was laid
out on a board covered with brown paper. This surface precludes
burrowing by the animal. The light source box was then placed on this
board and the entire apparatus was placed in a darkroom of 14Â°0, which
is slightly warmer than the nightly air temperature. Individuals were
tested by placing them in the center of the experimental grid and
noting where they left the grid. A positive response consisted of a
any individual leaving the circle in the quadrant which faced the
light. An individual was tested in each-of 4 orientations relative
to the direction of the light (see Appendix A). Four runs were made.
The first run used 9 individuals collected at 0100 and tested after
a period of acclimation to the experimental conditions. The second
run used animals collected at 1600 and tested at that time. The
