Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
period. The individuals were then observed periodically at intervals
of 3 or 4 hours for one day to check activity levels at different
times.
A second control experiment was conducted to check the possi¬
bility of light leaks in the darkened chambers containing the 2
laboratory populations. Strips of Kodac photography paper were
introduced into the chamber and removed after periods of exposure
of 1, 2, and 60 minutes. The paper was then developed to see if it
had been exposed by light.
RESULTS
The field population studied showed a clearly delimited period
of activity during the night hours (Figures 1, 2, and 3). Peak
activity generally occurred between 2200 and 0200.
Little correlation was noted between environmental factors and
the initiation of activity (Figure 3). There is no consistent
relation between fluctuations in activity and corresponding fluctua¬
tions in temperature or humidity. There is a suggestion of a
relation between activity and saturation defecit, as no activity
is seen when the saturation defecit exceeds 2.5.
A strong correlation existed between the onset of activity
and sunset, and between the cessation of activity and sunrise.
A. perconvexus shows a statistically significant (p.O1 in
a chi square test) positive phototropic response in all cases where
the experiments were conducted during night hours (Figure 4). In
