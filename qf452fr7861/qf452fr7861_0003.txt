An Association

removed.
Approximately 25 Acmaea and 10 chitons of species other than
Nuttallina were investigated, but no C. dentiens were found
under any of these animals.
A 12-hour night watch was conducted of 5 Nuttallina, 3
with Cyanoplax dentiens naturally occurring and 2 with C.
dentiens introduced under them. The positions of all chitons
had been previously mapped out and marked two days prior to
the watch. A red light was used at regular one-haur intervals
to observe the chitons and the distance they had travelled.
To be able to make regular readings even at high tide, the
investigator wore a wet suit and face-mask. During the watch
3 Nuttallina left their locations; 2 returned to take up their
original position. No C. dentiens moved during the watch
despite the fact that those exposed by the moving Nuttallina
encountered heavy wave shock. Dessication may play a larger
role in the association than wave shock since Nuttallina move
primarily at night (Moore, 1974), a time when dessication rates
are low.
Laboratory Studies
It seemed likely that Cyanoplax dentiens could detect the
