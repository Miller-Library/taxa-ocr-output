An Association
Between Two Chitons
smaller chiton. Once under the Nuttallina, the Cyanoplax
oriented lengthwise along the pallial groove, but showed no
preference to facing anteriorly or posteriorly relative to the
"host".
Discussion
Cyanoplax dentiens, in using Nuttallina californica as
a microhabitat, is benefited in several ways: protection
against dessication,  sunlight, predators and against
other physical parameters. C. dentiens further restricts its
habitat by not locating itself under either those Muttallina
outside of the mid-zone of the Nuttallina range or those
exposed to stronger light; the latter restriction perhaps a
afarent
result of its,negative phototaxis.
Cyanoplax dentiens can seek out and detect Nuttallina,
as the Y-maze test indicated, presumably using a chemical cue.
This ability implies coevolution has occurred.
Summary
1) Cyanoplax dentiens was found underneath Juttallina
californica, along its pallial groove.
2) The association was restricted primarily to those
Nuttallina on a shady vertical or angled rock face in the
