presence and direction of a nearby "host" Nuttallina since the
low field density of the latter would make chance encounter
an unlikely event. In order to test for the ability to detect
chemical cues carried down a flow of water from a Nuttallina
a simple Y-maze experimented was conducted. Three 12-hour
trials were run using ten fresh Cyanoplax starting at the base
of the Y for each trial. At the top of one arm of the Y was
placed a Nuttallina and a glass vial was placed at the top of
the other arm in order to approximately match any possible
turbulence in the fresh sea water which was allowed to flow
equally down each arm towards the base (Fig. 1). Pooled
results indicated non-random movement (chi-square test; p«.01).
with 18 C. dentiens moving over 1 cm. toward the Nuttallina
and 3 over 1 cm. away. A control without a Nuttallina showed
random movement.
A phototaxic test of C. dentiens was run in a wooden

tray with

Fifteen C. dentiens were placed along the mid-line of the tray
and tested for 12 hours. Fourteen went 2 cm. or more away
from the light, indicating negative phototaxis.
On three occasions Cyanoplax dentiens kept in finger bowls
with Nuttallina were observed to move under their "host". The
Nuttallina neither conspicuously lifted its girdle to accomodate
the Cyanoplax nor did it make an obvious attempt to avoid the
