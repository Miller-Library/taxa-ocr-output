An Association
Between Two Chitons
Introduction
The habits and habitats of Cyanoplax dentiens (Gould, 1846)
have received little attention. Those papers that have
investigated C. dentiens (Heath, 1905; Berry, 1917; Berry, 1948)
indicate a far ranging intertidal habitat for it but give no
mention of interactions between it and other organisms.
Presented is a report on a finding that this small (2 1 cm.)
chiton Cyanoplax dentiens (Light, 1964; Smith, 1974) is often
found under the moderately large (=40 cm.) chiton Nuttallina
californica (Reeve, 1847). Field and laboratory studies show
that: a) this association is not random; b) C. dentiens is
negatively phototaxic; c) C. dentiens can actively crawl under
Nuttallina; and d) C. dentiens can detect and seek out Nuttallina.
Field Studies
A total of over 100 Nuttallina from Carmel Beach, Carmel,
California; Point Pinos, Pacific Grove, California; and Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California, were removed; only under those
Nuttallina from Point Pinos were many Cyanoplax dentiens found.
The association between Nuttallina and C. dentiens was restricted
to vertical and angled rock faces with moderate to little light
exposure in the mid-zone of the Nuttallina range (3-4 foot
tidal height).
