(Spatial scales of variation)
I. Fu
Abstract:
The spatial scales of variation of three intertidal invertebrates were determined using a
nested sampling design and optimal quadrat size for each species. Sampling was done at sites,
which were kilometers apart; subsites within sites, which were roughly 100 meters apart; transects
within subsites, which were about 10 meters apart; and quadrats, which were on the scale of
meters apart. An analysis of variance revealed that Lottia limatula is patchy on the spatial scale of
tens of meters, while Serpulorbis squamigerus is patchy on the spatial scale of hundreds of meters,
with considerable spatial variation within the patches themselves. For Littorina planaxis, there
were no significant differences at any of the three levels of nesting, indicating that the snail is fairly
evenly distributed in the sites sampled. The index of departure from the Poisson distribution and
the index of aggregation for S. squamigerus and L. planaxis indicate that both species tend to
have clumped distributions, which agree with the natural histories of these organisms. The indices
are more ambiguous for L. limatula, but the presence of a few high and many low counts, as well
as aspects of the natural history of this organism, indicate a clumped distribution. Determination of
the spatial scales of variation for an organism to be studied permits the formation of a sampling
design that maximizes accuracy and precision while minimizing the total costs in terms of time,
effort, and money.
