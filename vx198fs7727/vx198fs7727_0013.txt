Table 2: Index of departure from the Poisson distribution (Dp), index of aggregation (ID,
and variance to mean ratios of the three species. Dp refers to the degree of overlap between
the observed distribution and the Poisson distribution. M measures how many times more
likely it is that two randomly selected individuals will be from the same quadrat than it
would be if the individuals in the population were distributed at random.
