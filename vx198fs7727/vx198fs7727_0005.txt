Data Analysis
Cochran’s tests were run on the data to detect heterogeneity of variances (Underwood
1981). For all three species, the Cochran’s test were significant (pæ0.05), indicating that the
variances were too heterogeneous to meet the assumptions of an ANOVA. To increase the
homogeneity of the transect variances, the limpet and tube snail counts were transformed by taking
the square root of the count for each quadrat and then adding the result to the square root of the
count plus one (Sokal & Rohlf 1995). L. planaris data was transformed by taking the square roots
of the counts. After transformation, only the limpet data remained heterogeneous. Subsequent
tests for these data were conducted at a-0.0l rather than 0.05. The transformed data were then
analyzed using a three factor nested ANOVA.
To determine whether the distributions of the species were random, regular, or aggregated,
the variance to mean ratio, the index of departure from the Poisson curve, and the index of
aggregation were calculated for each of the species (Hurlbert 1990). The index of departure was
calculated using the following equation:
Dp=1-2 min (qy0, qk0.
were Dp is the index of departure, w is the largest number of individuals observed in any quadrat,
k is the number of individuals per quadrat, qup is the number of quadrats expected to contain k
individuals in a Poisson distribution, and qua is the number of quadrats containing k individuals in
the observed distribution (Hurlbert 1990). The index of aggregation was calculated using the
following formula:
IM-(X/X-1) (1/X) (Var /X+X-1),
where IM is the index of aggregation, Xis the total number of individuals that were counted, Xis
the average count for all the quadrats sampled, and Var is the variance. IM measures how many
times more likely it is that two randomly selected individuals will be from the same quadrat than if
the X individuals in the population were distributed at random (Hurlbert 1990).
