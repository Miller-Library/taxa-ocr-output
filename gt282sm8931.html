Introduction
The harpacticoid copepod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tigriopus californicus : Exact'>Tigriopus californicus</span> is a major inhabitant
of pools in the highest intertidal zone on the rocky coast of western North
America. These tide pools experience water exchange with the sea during
only the very highest tides or in rough weather, and are otherwise wetted
by splash and spray alone.
Prelimminary observations showed <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tigriopus : Exact'>Tigriopus</span> to exhibit two general types
of reactions to light: (1) the tendency to aggregate either toward or away from
an illuminating source of relatively stable intensity, and (2) dramatic changes
in the activity, swimming speed, and rate of turning in response to sudden
changes in light intensity.
Early field observations suggested that the distribution of Tigriopus
within high tide pools is influenced by light intensity; the densest concentra¬
tions of copepods were seen in the most dimly illuminated areas. Published
studies of the light responses in Tigriopus are lacking, but some other species
have been examined. The harpacticoid copepod, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Harpacticus fulvus : Exact'>Harpacticus fulvus,</span> tends to congre-
gate away from bright sunlight (Blum 1934). Several copepod species are known
to orient to polarized light, including the harpacticoid <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tisbe furcata : Exact'>Tisbe furcata</span>
(Umminger 1968). Finally, it is well-established that the vertical distribution
of pelagic oceanic copepods fluctuates diurnally, and the animals respond to
light intensity cues (Enright 1967, Backus 1965).
The environment of Tigriopus californicus is quite different from the
open ocean; it is extremely variable with respect to salinity, temperature, pH,
dissolved oxygen concentration, and turbulence, and affords little capacity to
buffer environmental changes (fgloff 1964). It is consequently easy to envisior
adaptive advantages for particular responses to light under particular
environmental stimuli, yet to date no study on the phototactic response in
Tigriopus or of the effect of light intensity on the distribution of Tigriopus
within high tide pools exists.
Early observations also revealed that Tigriopus exhibits a specific
"dart-and-freeze" response (a sudden increase in forward speed, followed immediately
by immobility) when exposed to a sudden decrease in illumination. This behavior
has not been reported in other copepods or high tide pool invertebrates, though many
animals show a "shadow reflex" of some sort. Early observations also indicated
clearly that Tigriopus behaves differently upon first exposure to a given light
intensity than it does after a period of adjustment. The aim of the present
research was to answer two separate questions: (1) How does Tigriopus californicus
respond to sudden changes in light intensity?, and (2) How does a population of
Tigriopus californicus distribute itself in a light intensity gradient?
Response to Sudden Changes in Intensity of Light
General Materials and Methods
The response to changes in light intensity was assessed in terms of
activity, as measured by (1) the percent of animals moving, and (2) the swimming
velocity of moving animals. For the purpose of this research, animals swimming at
speeds less than 2 mm/sec were considered stationary,
To determine activity, experimental copepods were collected from a single
moderate-sized tide pool at a tidal height of about eight feet above mean lower
low water near the Hopkins Marine Station on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California,
from April to June, 1977. During the course of the experiments, the salinity in
this pool was observed to vary between 35 and 60 parts per thousand, and the
concentration of dissolved oxygen between 7 and 11 ml 09/1.
For each experiment, 25 to 40 copepods collected from the tide pool about
twenty minutes beforehand were placed in a pyrex petri dish 14 cm in diameter
filled with freshly filtered sea water at a depth of 3 mm. The petri dish was
evenly illuminated from above at intensities of up to 2.0 watts/m2, as measured
by a Lambda Instrument Corporation Model LI-185 photometer held just below the
petri dish. The light originated from four 12 volt tungsten filament bulbs at a
distance of 15 cm above the dish, and was passed through one sheet of ordinary
white paper before entering the petri dish so as to simulate the diffuse overhead
lighting of a tidepool on an overcast day (fig. 1). The copepods were left in
darkness in this set-up for fifteen minutes before any experimental light
stimulus was presented.
The movement of the copepods was followed by high speed photographs
made at 0.5 second intervals with a Nikon F-2S camera and a MD-2 motor drive
attachment mounted 40 cm below the petri dish, and using available light. All
copepod velocities were calculated by projecting the sequence of negatives
through a photographic enlarger and tracing on paper the image of the copepods
shown in each negative. A grid above the petri dish permitted tracing successive
images in exact register, thereby indicating the position of each individual
copepod at 0.5 second intervals.
Prelimminary observations indicated no significant difference in the
swimming behavior of males and females. Consequently, the more clearly visible
ovigerous females were used in all experiments unless otherwise indicated.
Since the entire petri dish was not visible in the photographs, the swimming
speeds of copepods very near the edges or otherwise out of the field of view
were not measured. Swimming velocity, in each case, was calculated from measure¬
ments made directly from tracings of the successive images of the same animal;
all measurements were made from the anterior end. When motion was too slight
to permit measurement every half second, measurements were made as often as
possible.
All experiments were performed at 2111 C and in a salinity of 35 ppt.
Experiments
How Does Tigriopus Respond to the Onset of Illumination?
Before determining the effect of any light stimulus on Tigriopus, it was
first necessary to distinguish the effect of turning on the light from the effect
of the light itself. An experiment was performed, employing the procedure described
in "General Materials and Methods," and using an intensity around 1.1 watts/m.
The light stimulus was presented, and activity was measured immediately and at
intervals for nearly two hours thereafter. The results are shown in figure 2.
When Tigriopus is exposed to light after a period of darkness, a marked decrease
in activity occurs immediately, reaching a minimum within two minutes, from which
the animals recover to previous activity levels. Abrupt illumination has been
found to arrest the swimming movement of other copepod species as well (Rose 1925).
fifteen
Levels of activity do not change rapidly after
minutes, and this may represent
short (5min.)
the state of activity characteristic of a given intensity after a period of
adjustment.
Does the Response to Illumination Depend on the Past Light History of Tigriopus?
Before comparing the activity of Tigriopus at various light intensities
presented in sequence, it was necessary to establish that the light response does
not depend on thehistory of illumination of the experimental animals. The experiment
illustrated in figure 3 compares the response of a group of copepods after two
identical exposures of light separated by fifteen minutes of darkness, using the
basic procedure given in "General Materials and Methods." The response was
essentially similar in each instance; the animals started at the same level of
activity, displayed a sudden decrease in activity of the same magnitude followed
by a gradual increase, and reached the same level after fifteen minutes of
illumination. The response to light considered here, then, does not depend
significantly on the past light history of Tigriopus, at least beyond the last
fifteen minutes.
Does the Response to Illumination Depend on Intensity?
In order the role of intensity in the light response, a group
of randomly sexed copepods were exposed sequentially to four light intensities
from 1.95 to 0.05 watts/m', in order of decreasing magnitude, preceded in each case
by fifteen minutes of darkness, following the basic procedure given in "General
Materials and Methods." The results are shown in figure 4a and b. The qualitative
nature of the response is the same in each case, but there are some important
quantitative differences related to intensity. The activity is shown to increase on
balance with light intensity, when compared after fifteen minutes exposure to light
(figures ba and b). This type of behavior, where a locomotory response increases with
light intensity, has been observed in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Branchipus : Exact'>Branchipus</span> (Haidinger 1844), and
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Daphnia magna : Exact'>Daphnia magna</span> (Koller 1928).
The variation in swimming velocity is large, and skewed toward low speeds,
approximating a Poisson-type distribution, as might be expected by the periodic
pauses and bursts of swimming characteristic of Tigriopus.
Studies in other invertebrates suggest that responses to change in light
intensity may be governed largely by the sensitivity of the eye over various intensity
ranges and the capacity of the eye to adapt to intensity (Fraenkel and Gunn 1961). The
fraction of Tigriopus affected by the stimulus is indicative of the animal's
sensitivity to that stimulus. When the activity immediately following exposure to
light (time zero), M, is compared with the activity at maximum response (minimum
activity), M, a measure of percent effect is obtained, which corresponds to the
absolute sensitivity of Tigriopus to that light intensity, as shown in figure 6. An
area of heightened sensitivity to light occurs around 0.35 watts/m, where the product
of intensity and relative sensitivity to light (S, the relative response/quanta of
light stimulus) reaches maximum. The response/quanta is greatest in dimest light.
probably a result of adaption. The sensitivity to light has been shown to exhibit
various minimum intensities in other crustaceans with median eyes: 0.4 watts/m' in
Daphnia magna (Heberdey and Kupka 1942) and between 1 and 10 watts/m in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus improvisus : Exact'>Balanus
improvisus</span> (v. Buddenbrock 1930).
The degree to which Tigriopus resumes time zero levels of activity following
the maximum response is indicative of the animal's ability to adapt to changes in
light intensity. If the magnitude of the response (difference between the mean swim¬
ming velocity at time zero and at maximum response, i.e. V -V
is compared with the
magnitude of the recovery (difference between the mean swimming velocity at maximum
recovery within fifteen minutes and at maximum response, i.e. V...
-V ), a measure
of the ability to adapt to intensity is obtained (figure 7). There are two salient
features to this relation: (1) Tigriopus adapts more readily to dim light than strong
light (perhaps explaining the greater relative sensitivity, to dim light), and
(2) there is a region of "negative adaption," at higher intensities where the
recovery is larger than the response.
How does Tigriopus respond to increases in illumination from below?
In order to answer this question, the procedure described in "General Materials
and Methods" was followed with these exceptions: (1) the petri dish was illuminated
from below at intensities from 4.5 to 7.0 watts/m, as measured directly above the
petri dish, (2) the light originated from two 12 volt tungsten filament bulbs about
15 cm below the dish, (3) photographs were taken with the camera mounted
about 40 cm above the dish, (4) randomly sexed animals were used, and (5) animals
were collected and left in darkness for fifteen minutes as before. After this per¬
iod, the copepods were exposed to a light intensity of 4.5 watts/m2. No photographs
were taken at this time. After fifteen minutes, ten frames of film were exposed
at two frames/sec. After the third frame was exposed, the light intensity was
increased to 7.0 watts/m'. The results are presented in figure 8. Upon increased
illumination, the swimming velocity of the copepods did not change much; however
the amount of turning increased markedly, and then attenuated with time,
This response provides suggestive evidence for the involvement of
klinokinesis in the orientation of Tigriopus to light, in the scheme of Fraenkel
and Gunn (1961), where the rate of change of direction is a function of light
intensity. The observations made of Tigriopus are similar to those obtained from the
klinokinetically orienting planarian <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Dendrocoelum : Exact'>Dendrocoelum</span> (Ullyott 1936), except that the
magnitude of the response is up to fourteen times greater and the speed of the res¬
ponse is up to 250 times as rapid; Tigriopus resumes ordinary swimming behavior
well within one minute after the increase in intensity. Since the attenuation
is in part a function of sensory adaption in the eye, the behavior suggests a
particularly rapid ability of Tigriopus to adapt to changes in illumination, even
when compared with the adaption times measured for other crustaceans: 6-10 minutes
in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Palaemon serratus : Exact'>Palaemon serratus</span> and <span style='background-color:grey' title='Praunus flexuosus : Fuzzy'>Praunus flexusus,</span> 3 minutes in <span style='background-color:grey' title='Pandalus montagui : Fuzzy'>Pandalus montaqui</span> (deBruin
and Crisp 1957), and 3-5 minutes in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ligia : Exact'>Ligia</span> (Ruck and Jahn 1954).
How does Tigrionus respond to Sudden Decreases in Light Intensity?
Tigriopus californicus in the water column of tide pools dart downwards
for a brief period of time when a shadow is cast upon them, become immobile, and
then swim up from the bottom in great numbers. In order to study this response in
the laboratory, the basic procedure given in "General Materials and Methods" was
used. After a fifteen minute exposure to an intensity of 1.5 watts/m, the light
intensity was decreased to 0.05 watts/m', photographing the response of Tigriopus
continuously at two frames/sec. The response, measured in terms of activity,
closely parallels field observations in time course (fig.9). There are three
distinct phases to the response: a "darting" response, characterized by a marked
increase in activity over 0.5 seconds, a "freeze" response in which a four-fold
decrease in activity occurs within 2 seconds, and a gradual increase in activity
that immediately follows. It was noticed that Tigrionus must be exposed to some light
for a brief period before any response to shadow can be observed, the length
of time required being longer at low intensities, emphasizing the role of adaption
in responses to light. Extended periods in the dark have been found to eliminate
the shadow response in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus : Exact'>Balanus</span> for some time as well (v. Buddenbrock 1930).
The"dart-and-freeze" response observed may be of special ecological
significance to Tigriopus, in the form of an escape response. This type of
behavior has been observed in some other animals as part of a predator-escape
mechanism, although it is usually associated with camuflaging and is not specifi¬
cally a response to shadow. It is possible, however, that Tigriopus "darts-and¬
freezes" in response to the shadow of a large predator, such as Pachygrapssus.
It is also possible that the shadow response is used to avoid being washed
to sea during a high tide or rough weather. When the sun is at a small angle above
the horizon, waves can cast shadows into tide pools. In fact, any turrbulence in
tide pools can produce changes in the pattern of illumination and shadow that may
elicit a response from the copepods. Tigriopus is positively geotactic and negatively
phototactic in response to turbulence (Foster,and Burnett, personal communication).
The quick downward movement characteristic of the shadow response may serve to
enhance these taxes and permit Tigriopus to avoid turbulence by aggregating in
dark cracks and under rocks on the bottom of tide pools. The value of the subsequent
gradual increase in activity after immobility is uncertain.
Distribution in a Light Intensity Gradient
Materials and Methods
In order to determine the distribution of Tigriopus in
a constant
light gradient, the density of copepods was assessed at various points along a
plexiglas trough exposed to horizontally increasing light intensity. A horizontal
gradient was chosen in order to clearly discriminate between phototactic and
geotactic responses. The illumination was provided by a standard 43cm 15 watt
flourescent bulb above and parallel to the trough as shown in figure 10a One end
of the light source was covered by several layers of neutral density screen and
cardboard tubing; the resultant gradient is shown in figure lOb, as measured with
a Lambda Instrument Corporation Model LI-185 photometer held as near to one cm
below the surface as possible.
For each set of experiments, about 200 randomly sexed Tigriopus were
collected as described in earlier experiments. The copepods were placed in the
trough, distributed evenly, and left in darkness for fifteen minutes, at which
time the light gradient was presented. The distribution of animals was not
observed to change appreciably after fifteen minutes exposure to the gradient.
Consequently, the distribution recorded between 15 and 45 minutes were taken to
be indicative of phototactic behavior.
Tigriopus density was determined by looking through the unpapered side of
the trough and counting the number of copepods visible in ½x  cm quadrats at
various positions along the length of the gradient, one cm below the surface. This
depth represented the population distribution within the entire trough, since the
relative densities of Tigriopus did not appear to vary with depth. Animal density
10
was determined by correcting for the volume counted. For each set of replicate
experiments, the same animals were used, collected in a fine screen, and reintro¬
duced to the trough prior to the experiment. In order to correct for variations in
the total number of animals used in comparable experiments, the distribution was
expressed in some cases as the percent of total animals counted occuring in each
of nineteen 2 cm segments along the trough (figure 10a).
In order to study the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on
phototaxis, three preparations of filtered sea water were used in the trough:
water water
water
N2-bubbled, aerated, and 0,-bubbled, with respective dissolved oxygen concentra-
tions of 0.7, 6.6, and 14+ ml 0,/1 before the experiment, and 4.0, 6.5, and 14+
ml 0,/1 afterwards, as measured with a Yellow Springs Model 54 oxygen electrode. All
experiments were performed at 2111 C and in a salinity of 35 ppt.
Experiments
How do Tigriopus distribute in the trough in the Abs ence of a Light Gradient?
When placed in the trough in aerated sea water under even illumination,
ed
copepods demonstrat no preference for one end of the trough or the other after
fifteen minutes (fig 10c).
How do Tigriopus distribute in the trough in the Pres ence of a Light Gradient?
How does Dissolved oxygen concentration affect this Distribution?
In order to answer these questions, the distribution of Tigrionusin the
gradient was measures at three different concentrations of dissolved oxygen. For
each concentration, several replicate experiments were performed. The results of
each experiment are shown in figure 11. A number of observations were made in
each case, and the results in figure 11 represent the means for observations
recorded between 15 and 45 minutes.
11
The mean values for all observations are shown in figure 12.
It is evident from these experiments that (1) Tigriopus is positively
phototactic at these intensities over a broad range of dissolved oxygen concentra-
tions, and (2) the degree of positive phototaxis is greatest at low oxygen con¬
centrations, where the population distribution is more visibly skewed toward
the light. A measure of the phototactic tendend, is given by the slope of the
regression line for relative copepod density as a function of light intensity
because
(fig. 12). For this measure, two cm at each end of the trough were excluded copepods
were found to accumulate at both ends simply because of the associated decrease
in the number of available swimming vectors. While the data gives a reasonable
fit to a straight line, it is possible that a nonlinear function more nearly
describes the actual behavior. The slopes of the regression lines are compared with
dissolved oxygen concentrations in figure 13,
General Discussion
From the studies on Tigriopus californicus, it is clear that experimental
light conditions are highly artificial. However, laboratory experiments have
revealed aspects of the phototactic response that cannot be studied separately
in the field.
In the laboratory, attempts were made to simulate natural lighting as
nearly as possible; however, conditions differed from those in the field in three
major respects: (1) the intensity range, (2) the degree of directionality, and
(3) the degree to which the light intensity attenuates with distance.
Intensities in most experiments ranged from less than 0.04 watts/m? to
2.3 watts/m', as compared with light of 100 times greater magnitude striking the
surface of a tide pool on a bright day. The intensities studied, however, are by
no means completely unnatural, since: (1) the range observed in the field extends
from less than 0.002 watts/m at night to around 200 watts/m on a bright day,
and the range of intensities studied is well within this, (2) at least half the time,
tide pools are more dimly illuminated in the field than under conditions studied
in the laboratory ,(3) at least two times a day, at dawn and dusk, tide pools are
exposed to the intensities studied, and (4) the sensitivity to light in crustaceans
can extend well below the range of intensities studied, to 10 2 or 10  watts/m
(Waterman 1939).
On a clear day, parellel light rays from the sun clearly provide a directional
source of illumination to tide pool inhabitants. Light from a laboratory
source is not composed of parllel rays, and consequently may present a different
kind of stimulus to an experimental animal. In order to distinquish a response to a
to light intensity gradientfrom a response to a directional light source in
Tigriopus, attempts were made to provide as nearly a nondirectional source as
possible; however, the at sence of directionality was in no way completely
acheived.
Since light intensity decreases inversely with the square of the distance
from the source, the intensity of light at the surface of a tide pool is very
water
nearly the same as the intensity reaching the bottom, unless the tide pool is very
turbid. In the atsience of vertical intensity gradients, copepods may orient to
horizontal ones produced by shadows. In the laboratory, however, light intensity
attenuates rapidly through a distance of water. Consequently, a horizontal gradient
was used in these studies to more closely approximate what Tigriopus might encounter
in nature.
From these studies, there is evidence that kinetic and tactic mechanisms are
both involved in the response of Tigriopus to light, that Tigriopus can exhibit
13
both positive and negative phototaxis, and that each may be important to its
behavior in the field.
The increase in swimming speed and activity associated with increases in
light intensity, and the apparent dependence of activity on light in general
suggest that orthokinesis may be involved in the light response. The increase
in turning upon increasing illumination indicates that klinokinesis may be
involved as well. At least, there is the suggestion of a kinetic component to
the light response.
If the light response was exclusively kinetic, then the evidence collected
would predict Tigriopus to show negative phototaxis up to at least 2.0 watts/m’,
The copepods would cluster in dimly illuminated areas where they were least active
and where an approach of the margins stimulated turning. In the trough, however,
Tigriopus is attracted to the brightest end, making the inclusion of a directed
taxis in the mechanism of the light response unavoidable. The frequent observation
of Tigriopus in aquaria congregating away from bright sunlight in the aks ence
of an intensity gradient further establishes the necessity for a directed taxis
in the light response mechanism. In fact, light-directed swimming can clearly
be observed in the phototactic response of Tigriopus to high salinities (positive
phototaxis), turbulence (negative phototaxis), and environmental anoxia (positive
phototaxis).
It is quite possible that both kinetic and tactic mechanisms are
involved in Tigriopus. A kinetic component to a phototactic response has been
studied before in the mussel crab <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pinnotheres maculatus : PartialExact'>Pinnotheres maculatus say</span> (Welsh 1932).
While the kinetic and tactic components of a locomotory response are
ordinarily inseparable, there is some indication that they act independently to
some extent in Tigriopus. The "dart-and-freeze" response to shadow in Tigriopus
14
is clearly directional in the field, but in experiments using diffuse light, swim¬
ming is undirected; the response observed is purely kinetic, and yet in that
aspect it follows closely the time course of the field response.
Tigriopus also appears to be both positively phototactic at low intensities
and negatively phototactic at high intensities. This behavior has been reported in
another copepod species, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Labidocera : Exact'>Labidocera</span> (Herter, 1927). Other investigators have found
a progressively stronger positive phototaxis in Tigriopus to overhead lighting as
intensity is increased to 16 watts/m that diminishes at higher intensities
(H. Townsend, pers. comm.). The significance of this trend may lie in the control
of diurnal migration, or in the capacity of Tigriopus to seek a preferred isolume
that is optimal in some respect to its life history. Observations of the copepod
aggregated along a shadow interface suggest that this possibly occurs (R. Burnett,
pers. comm.).
Summary
Tigriopus californicus, a high tide pool copepod, shows several separate
responses to light.
Dark-adapted <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. californicus</span> demonstrate a marked decrease in activity
immediately following the onset of illumination, reaching a minimum after 1-2
minutes.
Quantitative analysis of the light response indicates: (1) T. californicus
exhibits a heightened sensitivity to light at an intensity of 0.35 watts/m'. (2)
dark-adapted T. californicus more readily adaptsto dim light than strong light,
(3) the swimming velocity and activity of T. californicus increases with the
intensity of light
exposed to.
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>I. californicus</span> exhibits a specific "dart-and-freeze" response to shadow
which may involve independentkinetic and tactic reactions, and which may be an
15
escape mechanism.
T. californicus responds to an increase in illumination from below by a
marked increase in the rate of turning which attenuates with time.
T. californicus exposed to a horizontal gradient of overhead lighting
extending from 0.008 to 2.3 watts/m exhibit positive phototaxis in still water
over a broad range of oxygen concentrations. The magnitude of this taxis increases
as the level of dissolve oxygen decreases.
Comparison of the intensity-dependent activity of T. californicus and its
distribution within a horizontal light gradient indicates that the mechanism of
the light response involves both perception of light intensity and direction.
T. californicus demonstrate both positive phototaxis at low light intensities
and negative phototaxis at high intensities.

Figure 4: a. Response of Tigriopus to four sequential light
stimuli of decreasing intensity, preceded each time with
fifteen minutes of darkness: A--1.95 watts/m, B--1.05
watts/m, C—-0.58 watts/m, and D—0.05 watts/m. An illustra¬
tion of response magnitude is shown by the double-headed arrow
in response A. The percent population moving is given by My at
at maximum re-
the onset of illumination (time zero), and by M

results given as mean swimming velocity for moving Tigriopus
(O) and mean swimming velocity for all Tigriopus observed (0).
The response magnitude and recovery magnitude are illustrated
by double-headed arrows in response B. The mean swimming velocity
of the population is given at time zero by V, at maximum
and at maimum recovery within fifteen minutes

Figure 6: Sensitivity of Tigriopus to light at various
intensities, as measured by the response to the onset
of illumination. Absolute sensitivity is given by the
magnitude of the response, as measured by percent effect,
E, where:
(see Fia ta, page 24
E S   x 100.
Relative sensitivity to light, S, is given by absolute sensitiv¬
ity corrected for intensity, I, in terms of relative percent
effect: S-E/I. This is a measure of the relative magnitude
of response per quanta of light stimulus. This adjusts for the
fact that at higher intensities, there is more light to produce
an effect.

Figure 7: Tendency to adapt to light at various intensities as
measured by the ratio of the response upon illumination
to the recovery. Absolute tendency to adapt, A, is given
by:

The line where Recovery equals Response is shown with a dashed
line (A=100). Relative tendency to adapt is given by (A-100)XI
where I is the intensity of light. This corrects for the fact
that low intensities represent a less radical shift from darkness
than higher ones and adaption occurs more readily.
