Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
(1)
The marine parasitic isopod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lironeca vulgaris : Exact'>Lironeca vulgaris</span> (Stimpson)
is frequently found on several species of fish inhabiting
Pacific Ocean coastal waters of the United States. I have
observed the isopod in the gill chambers of the flatfishes

and the sculpin <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Leptocottus armatus : Exact'>Leptocottus armatus</span> from Monterey Bay, California.
It also occurred in the rockfish <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sebastes : Exact'>Sebastes</span> sp., the Ling <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ophiodon elongatus : Exact'>Ophiodon

off Southern Oregon. It is likely the parasite infests other
fishes aside from those listed. Its distribution is from Baja
California to Washington State (Schultz, 1969).
The objective of this study was to determine behavior patterns
and sensory capabilities utilized by larval Lironeca vulgaris to
locate hosts after release from the marsupium of the adult female.
The mechanisms of host finding looked for were (1) active use of
sense organs of the isopod to locate host fish from a distance.
followed by pursuit by the larval isopod, (2) ingestion of the
isopod by a host fish, with subsequent attachment of the isopod
to the interior of the mouth and movement by the isopod from the
mouth into the gill chamber, and (3) random movement by the
isopod until chance contact with the host fish occurred.

BEHAVIOR OF FREE-SWIMMING LARVAL
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lironeca : Exact'>LIRONECA</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Vulgaris : Exact'>VULGARIS</span>
Adult female L. vulgaris containing well-developed brood
were isolated individually in aerated containers. Brood
released from the marsupium and placed in a larger aquarium
moved to the upper and lighted part of an aquarium, generally
for the first four to eight hours. They then began swimming
near the bottom of the aquarium, touching it at relatively
regular intervals. Average distance between touchings was
4.1 cm. (values ranged from two to twelve centimeters) in 26
measurements. Swimming speed during this activity was between
3 cm. and 4 cm. per second. Little variation in swimming speed
was noted during the first four days after release from the
marsupium. No systematic pattern of swimming was noted.
Occasionally the isopod would skim along the bottom, appearing
to maintain continuous contact with it.
When larval isopods contacted a host they immediately
attached using the anterior peraeopods. The contact-recognition-
attachment sequence was rapid, requiring less than four seconds.
The isopods used were released from the marsupium in vitro;
consequently they had never been in contact with fish before.
The immediacy of the contact-recognition-attachment sequence
therefore indicates a genetically programed behavioral pattern.

The host fish generally attempted to dislodge newly attached
isopods. The Pointed-nosed Sole Parophrys vetulus rapidly
quivered the entire body, while the Curl-fin Sole Pleuronicthys
coenosus vigorously contorted the whole body. Although
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. coenosus</span> was relatively effective in dislodging isopods,
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. vetulus</span> rarely dislodged them. For this reason only P. vetulus
was used in experiments described later.
This behavior of L. vulgaris and host fish was observed
throughout the entire six week study, indicating both host and
parisite have highly stereotyped behavioral patterns.
SENSORY CAPABILITIES OF L. VULGARIS
IN HOST LOCATION
A 20 gallon aquarium containing a single uninfested
P. vetulus was placed in complete darkness. Twenty larval
L. vulgaris were then introduced. The number of isopods infesting
the fish after six hours was counted. An identical experiment
was run concurrently in constant light as a control. The results
from four runs are shown in figure 1.
The data in figure 1 indicate light, and therefore visual
stimulation, is not essential in host location by larval
L. vulgaris.

The following tests for chemoreception were done. A styro-
foam tank was fitted with 125 ml. flasks opening into either
end (figure 2).
A piece of P. vetulus approximately l cm2 was placed in one
flask. It had previously been observed that Lironeca vulgaris
fed readily on dead P. vetulus. Water was introduced into the
tank slowly to establish an unmixed gradient of fish scent.
Ten larval L. vulgaris were introduced and observed approximately
every two hours during daylight for two days. The experiment
was repeated using 20 larval isopods. At no time during the
experiments were isopods observed in either flask.
In another experiment a live P. vetulus was confined to a
single area on a large piece of plankton netting for two hours
and then removed, leaving some of the protective slime coating
on the mesh. The slime area was outlined in pencil and the
netting was stapled into an aquarium parallel to the bottom.
The aquarium was filled and approximately 15 larval isopods were
introduced. Normal larval swimming behavior was observed outside
the slime area. No larvae stopped swimming outside the slime
area during three hours of observations. At least five isopods
attached to the netting within the slime area for longer than
20 seconds following actual contact with the netting. Swimming
activity was resumed after halting, however, indicating the
Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgar
(5)
slime was not sufficient stimulus for permanent attachment.
Isopods swimming over the slime area without actually contacting
the mesh did not stop.
A choice experiment was run utilizing a Y-joint and a gentle
current which forced larvae to choose between a tank containing
a live fish and an empty control tank (figure 3).
The two tanks were filled with an equal volume of water.
A single P. vetulus was placed in one tank. Water dripping from
the excurrent capillary tube caused a slight current. All
tubing and the entire Y-joint was wrapped with black electrical
tape to eliminate light gradients. Larval isopods were inserted
in pairs into the introduction tube using an eye dropper, and
were removed when they emerged from the tubing into the tank.
The choice was then recorded.
Current flow from each tank was shown to be equal after the
experiment by putting methylene blue in one tank. A clear
division between blue water from one tank and colorless water
from the other was established down the exact center of the
choice chamber (figure 3).
Data on choice of 74 larvae is shown in table 1. The
presence of the fish had no clear effect on the choice of tube.

Throughout the six week study larval Lironeca vulgaris were
observed on at least 30 occasions to pass within ten centimeters
of the host fish without any visible reaction. The above work
indicates L. vulgaris does not use vision or chemoreception
as a means of locating hosts beyond a few centimeters distant.
It is conceivable that flatfish are infested by random
movement of the isopods, as indicated by the following model.
Flatfish population data was taken off Hopkins Marine Station
in Monterey Bay, using an otter trawl at depths between 20 and
28 meters. The data is shown in table 2.
A conservative estimate of the surface area of an average
sized adult flatfish is 100 cm2. A strip 10 cm. in width rep-
resents a mean between maximum probability of contact (fish
oriented perpendicular to the path of the isopod) and minimum
probability of contact (fish oriented parallel to the path of
the isopod). The width of a swath formed by a swimming isopod
is therefore 10 cm. Undamaged one to four day old larvae were
rarely observed resting during the six week study. For the
purposes of this model the larvae are considered to be constantly
swimming. Larval speed is constant at a conservative three
centimeters per second in this model. Isopod larvae in aquaria
generally swam in straight lines until diverted by obstructions.
Isopods will therefore swim in straight lines for model purposes.
Hence the area an isopod covers in four days is 1036 me, calculated

(7)
by (speed) X (time) X (swath width). Since the flatfish popu-
lation density was calculated to be roughly one fish per 65 me
the isopod covers approximately 15 times the area necessary to
find a single host. The chances of finding a host are undoubtedly
reduced by such factors as predation or environmental stress.
However, this rough model indicates that out of a brood of 300
larvae there is an excellent chance that one will infest a host
through random swimming activity, thereby increasing the isopod
population or at least keeping the population constant.
Random swimming cannot account for the infestation of the
active bottom fish Ophiodon elongatus or the pelagic salmon
Oncorhyncus kisutch. Both species are quick enough to easily
avoid isopods yet are occasionally infested. Six juvenile
0. elongatus between 12 and 16 cm. in length were exposed to
free swimming L. vulgaris. There was no reaction using three
larvae between four and five millimeters in length. Three
isopods between 1.0 and 1.5 cm. in length were ingested, but
all three attached to the interior of the mouth and subsequently
crawled into the gill chamber. An unidentified tidepool sculpin
took a one centimeter long isopod, which then crawled out the
mouth, over the operculum, and into the gill from the outside. In
all four observations the isopod avoided being swallowed. Thus
ingestion is a possible means by which these fish become infested.
No flatfishes were seen feeding on isopods.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
This investigation indicated larval L. vulgaris were inca-
pable of sensory perception of host fish without physical contact
between isopod and fish. Random activity as a means of infesting
flatfish was shown a possibility using behavioral studies in
combination with a brief study of flatfish population densities.
Infestation by the feeding upon the isopod by fish was
shown physically possible, and provided a logical explanation for
the occurence of the parasitic isopod on pelagic fish.
Much work remains to be done on this subject.

APPENDIX
NOTES ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF
L. VULGARIS
(1) Damage to gill filiments by isopods could be extensive.
Three or more large isopods could prevent closing of the
operculum of the host, resulting in death of the host. None
of the approximately 300 flatfish examined carried more than
three parasites. This suggests the existence of a mechanism
or behavior which limits the number of isopods per fish.
(2) Effective Lethal Time 50 was recorded for 30 starved
larval isopods, with 30 fed isopods as a control. ELT-50 was
defined as the time elapsed before half the isopods examined
could not swim when stimulated by a current of water from an
eye dropper. Fifteen of the thirty isopods were dead or could
not swim at the end of six days.
(3) Adult L. vulgaris of both sexes survived on a diet of
dead fish for at least three weeks.
(4) Adult L. vulgaris did not die after releasing larvae.
Size variation of 100 brooding females ranged from approximately
one gram to 3.25 grams. This suggests the possibility of
multiple broods by females. The suggestion is reinforced by
the observation of immature eggs in the ovary of a female already
Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
carrying almost mature brood.
(5) The largest L. vulgaris collected was a female (carrying
995 eggs) of length 3.4 cm., maximum width 2.0 cm., and a weight
of 3.25 gm. The normal number of eggs for L. vulgaris was
estimated at 250 to 400.
