Macrocystis added every two days. Pupae were removed, placed in corked vials,
and checked daily for hatching.
The picture of development obtained, while incomplete, provides the beÂ¬
ginning of a timetable for the life history. Data available are shown in Fig.5.
Duration of the third instar was shortest in Coelopa vanduzeei, longest
in Fucellia costalis. The former lives lowest in the intertidal zone, the latter
highest on the beach. Duration of pupal period showed considerable variation
among species and within C.vanduzeei. For the latter, there may be some connection
between intertidal height on the beach and length of pupal period. Although
later development took place in the laboratory, the 12 individuals of C.vanduzeei
which hatched after a 4 day pupal period were collected from buried wrack at the
13.0 foot tide level, while the individual which spent 9 days as a pupa was
taken from an upper beach wrack bank. L.johnsoni had a pupal period of 6-7 days,
F.rufitibia and F.costalis 12-15 days. F.costalis larvae may remain in the third
instar for considerable periods; one batch of 10 remained in this stage for 25
days before pupation.
Discussion
The flies appear to use different strategies in exploiting the available
food and habitat resources for larvae on the beach. C.vanduzeei is found almost
exclusively in lower beach wrack which is wetted at least once a day and seldom
remains on the beach longer than two weeks. The main pressure here is for quick
larval development and a short pupal period. The caudal plate hairs allow the
larva to breathe from air bubbles trapped in the wrack during periods of tidal
immersion. Immature F.costalis and F.rufitibia, found mainly on the mid and
upper beach levels, are able to use wrack for longer periods. Caudal hairs
are lacking. The danger of being washed out to sea is less than that of
desiccation. The pupal period reflects this, being relatively long. L.johnsoni
