red and brown algae and the surf grass Phyllospadix. The major deposits at
Point Lucas consisted of banks of the brown alga Macrocystis concentrated on
the upper beach at tidal heights of 15.0-6.5 feet. Coelopa vanduzeei larvae
were found exclusively in lower beach wrack banks. Fucellia costalis larvae
were found almost exclusively in the upper beach banks. F. rufitibia larvae
were found at all levels, but predominately on the mid and upper beach. L.
johnsoni larvae also occurred widely on the beach but were more evenly distrib-
uted. The occurrence of larvae in wrack corresponds well with the distribution
of the adult flies found on the same beach in studies by Hyatt (1972).
Vertical distribution of fly larvae within wrack banks is shown in Fig.AA.B.
in banks on the lower beach Coelopa vanduzeei predominated in the top 10 cm.
and L.johnsoni at the lowest levels. A small number of F.rufitibia were found,
at levels in
largely in areas between. F.costalis was absent. Observation of a lower
beach bank before and after complete immersion during a high tide showed that
numbers of C.vanduzeei present did not change; numbers of L.johnsoni diminished,
Rowever, suggesting a loss accompanying wave action. In the upper beach bank
(Fig. 48) Fucellia costalis larvae predominated, and F.rufitibia outnumbered
L.johnsoni at the lowest levels. C.vanduzeei was absent. High beach wrack banks
tended to dry out, and as this happened, larger larvae were observed moving down
in wrack over time.
Observations on feeding, behavior, and temporal variation
Larvae appeared to eat the algae on which they were found. Fragments of
Macrocystis were found in the guts of all species. Larvae were never observed
on very fresh wrack; apparently some decomposition must occur before the algae
are eaten. Nematodes were abundant where fly larvae were found and may be inÂ¬
volved in initial algae breakdown, as suggested by Egglishaw (1960B),
