larvae are found in large numbers and are distributed both high and low on the
beach. Their caudal plate hairs allow them to respire when submerged in wrack
beds low on the beach, but their small size makes them vulnerable both to being
swept out of low immersed wrack, and to desiccation in higher beach wrack.
Perhaps this is why L.johnsoni tends to occur well below the surface of wrack
banks. A comparison of mean tidal height of distribution and mean pupal period
for each species suggests that species found higher on the beach may have longer
pupal periods, although the variation within each species is large enough to
eliminate meaningful statistical comparison with present data.
Sumary
Larvae and pupae of Coelopa vanduzeei, Fucellia costalis, Fucellia rufitibia,
and Leptocera johnsoni were studied on two California beaches. Third instar
laryae and puparia are described. Studies of distribution of larvae on the beach
showed C.vanduzeei occupies lower beach wrack banks and F.costalis the upper
beach banks. F.rufitibia larvae, while widespread, occur more in mid and upper
beach wrack, while those of L.johnsoni are found at all levels. Larvae were
observed to prefer the kelp Macrocystis both as a habitat and food source.
C.vanduzeei larvae were observed in large numbers only during a two week period
coinciding with a major wrack deposit. F.costalis, F.rufitibia, and L.johnsoni
were found in constant numbers over 5 weeks. Duration of pupal periods in the
laboratory were: C.vanduzeei, 4-9 days; L.johnsoni, 6-7 days; F.costalis and
F.rufitibia 12-15 days. Average duration of the pupal period appears to increase
with increasing tidal height of the larval habitat.
