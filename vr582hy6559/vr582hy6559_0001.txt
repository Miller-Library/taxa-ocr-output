Introduction
The kelp (wrack) flies, Coelopa vanduzeei Cresson (1914), Fucellia
costalis Stein (1910), Fucellia rufitibia Stein (1910), and Leptocera johnsoni
Spuler (1925) are common on California beaches (Cole,1969). The life histories
of such related European species as Fucellia maritima and Coelopa frigida have
been studied (Egglishaw, 1960a and b), but little is known about the immature
forms of the Pacific coast species. Preliminary observations of fly larvae
found living in wrack suggested that a study of distribution and biology of
larvae on the beach would be valuable in further understanding how different
species of flies relate to the wrack, as a food source and habitat. This inÂ¬
vestigation was carried out April-June, 1972, on two pocket beaches of Monterey
Bay, Calif.:(1) the west beach of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, and (2) the
Point Lucas beach, Pacific Grove. My studies of larvae were accompanied by a
study of the activity patterns and behavior of adult wrack dipterans by another
investigator (Hyatt, 1972) at Mussel Point.
Characteristics of larvae and pupae (Fig. 1 and 2)
The larvae described were collected in the field and raised on samples of
damp wrack kept in the laboratory at room temperature. Initial identifications
were made on the basis of emerged adults. Samples of these adult flies were
examined and identified by Dr.Paul Arnaud of the California Acadamy of Sciences,
