Field studies
Distribution of fly larvae was studied on beaches at Mussel Point and Point
Lucas. Samples were taken at high, mid and low sections of the beach. Since
most larvae were found in wrack banks (piles greater than 15 cm in depth, as
defined by Backlund, 1945), vertical distribution within the banks was also
studied. Samples of wrack from various elevations on the beach, and samples
taken at depths of 10,20, and 30 cm within wrack banks, were collected in plastic
bags and returned to the laboratory. Larvae were extracted from the wrack by
shaking the samples vigorously with water, then capturing the smaller larvae
with a fine aquarium net. The wrack sample was then carefully examined for any
remaining larger larvae.
Fig. 3 shows the distribution of fly larvae from wrack banks stranded at
various elevations above mean lower low water. The majority of wrack deposits
at Mussel Point centered around the +3.0 tidal level and consisted of mixed
