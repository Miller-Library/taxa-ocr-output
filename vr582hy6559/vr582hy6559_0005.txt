Wrack consisting of the kelp Macrocystis seemed to be preferred above other
algae by all larvae collected from natural wrack. When wrack was experimentally
sorted out into separate piles containing only bron algae, only reds, only
Phyllospadix, or a mixture of all typ√©s, and placed on the beach for several
days, larvae were only found on brown and mixed wrack. Larvae placed on red
algae and Phyllospadix died within a day in the lab, while those on Macrocystis
flourished. Those kept without food died within two days, and larvae kept
without moisture died overnight.
Of the four species observed, the larvae of C.vanduzeei and L.johnsoni were
the most active and moved most rapidly.
Over the 5 week period of the study some temporal variation "was observed
in the numbers of C.vanduzeei larvae. In the last two weeks of April none were
found on the beach at Mussel Point. By May 2, they were found in small numbers
and in the week of May 8-15, occurred in multitudes in buried wrack on the lower
beach there and further south along the coast at Pebble Beach and Carmel. The
latter period ooincided with neap tides, and formation of major wrack deposits
on the beaches. By May 17 no more larvae were found and the wrack was also gone
from the beach. Fucellia costalis, F.rufitibia, and Leptocera johnsoni were
found in fairly constant numbers, but never as abundantly as Coelopa vanduzeei
at its peak, over the time interval noted. Some adult L.johnsoni were observed
mating in all wrack deposits observed over 5 weeks.
Laboratory raising of larvae
Attempts to obtain eggs and subsequent larval stages in the laboratory
from captive populations of flies maintained on wrack in large plastic bags
were not successful. However, larvae of the four species collected in the field
were reared successfully on Macrocystis stipes (examined first for foreign larvae
or eggs) in Petri dishes at room temperature. Cultures were wetted and new
