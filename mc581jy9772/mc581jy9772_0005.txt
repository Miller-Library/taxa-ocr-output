AFLP
AFLP was developed by Vos et al. (1995). The method involves multiple steps:
isolation of genomic DNA, double restriction digest, ligation of adapters, preamplification,
selective amplification and labeling, and autoradiography (Fig. 5).
Genomic DNA is cut by a four base cutter (Msel) and a six base cutter (EcoRl).
Synthesized oligo nucleotide adapters are then ligated to the ends of the restricted
fragments (Fig. 6). In the preamplification step, primers whose sequence are identical to
the adapter sequence and sticky end sequence with an additional random base on the 3
end are used. During the PCR reaction, the double stranded fragments with adapters on
the end denature, and the primers bind selectively to the fragments with the
complementary adapter/sticky end sequence as well as the complement to the random base
(Fig. 7). The PCR reaction amplifies these fragments. This provides selectivity by
amplifying only fragments with adapters followed by the complement to the random base.
In the selective amplification and labeling step, the primers are similar, except they
have an additional two random bases to increase selectivity. In this reaction, only the
fragments with both the complementary adapter sequence/sticky end sequence and three
bases complementary to the three on the primer are amplified (Fig. 8). This increases
selectivity again by amplifying only a subset of the fragments that were amplified in the
preamplification. Labeling of the fragments with radioactivity also occurs in this step, as
the EcoRl primer in this step is labeled with3
The product of the selective amplification and labeling step is resolved on a
polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Since each fragment is a unique size, it should migrate at
