completely off the gel, which took two to three hours. The dried gel was visualized by
autoradiography.

On the gels that were stained for LDH, all of the individuals from Hayward, San
Diego and San Felipe showed the same simple two-band pattern. The lack of variation
between the San Diego and San Felipe populations is consistent with Fields's (1995)
results. Figure 11, with one individual from San Felipe and eight from San Diego shows
the banding pattern that was characteristic for all the individuals that were stained for
LDH.
All of the individuals from Hayward and San Felipe also showed the same banding
when stained for MDH. The slowest band is the darkest, and there are two lighter bands
below the darkest one (Fig. 2 and 3). The individuals from San Diego, however, show
variation. As can be seen in Figure 14, the San Diego individuals show variation in the
fastest band. The individuals show three variations, which are evident in the individuals
labeled SDI, SD2, and SD3. SDI shows the same banding patterns as the Hayward and
San Felipe fish. SD2, however, shows three bands instead of one at the fastest position.
SD3 shows one band at the fastest position, but it has migrated farther than it did than in
the Hayward and San Felipe individuals. SDI is therefore homozygous for the slower
allele, SD2 is heterozygous, and SD3 is homozygous for the faster allele. Table 2 shows
the number of individuals with each genotype for the populations. 10 individuals from
