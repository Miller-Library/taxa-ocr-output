of adult fish) around the tip of Baja California into the Sea of Cortez to found the
population happened to all be homozygous for the slow allele. The individuals from San
Felipe would mostly be descended from the same founding fish and therefore are all
homozygous for the slow allele. For random genetic drift to cause the homozygosity of
the slow allele in San Felipe, the few fish that journeyed around the tip of Baja California
into the Sea of Cortez had both the slow and fast allele. Because the small population size,
these fish would not be in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, and the genotype frequencies
would not necessarily remain stable over time. By chance, the frequency of the fast allele
could have been reduced to nothing or almost nothing. From that point on, all the fish in
the San Felipe area would be homozygous for the fast allele (Hartl, et al., 1989).
Although the analysis of the MDH results suggest that there is low gene flow
among the three populations, the study is far from complete. Larger sample sizes, and
samples from more locations, particularly the Pacific coast of Baja California would be
needed before a firmer conclusion about the pattern of MDH genotypes among Gillichthys
can be drawn. In addition, analysis of many more protein loci would also be needed to
draw definitive conclusions about the population structure and dynamics of Gillichthys.
AFLP
The data from the AFLP technique were not sufficient to permit a firm conclusion
to be drawn about population structure. As shown in Figure 10, however, there were
some differences between the Hayward and San Diego individuals. Although these results
are preliminary, they do show promise that AFLP can potentially find differences between
samples of Gillichthys.
