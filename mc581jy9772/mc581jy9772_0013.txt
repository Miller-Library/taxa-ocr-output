DISCUSSION
Isozyme electrophoresis
All of the LDH gels showed a simple two-band pattern. The lighter band on top is
most likely the heart type homotetramer and the dark band is most likely due to the muscle
isoform.
MDH is a dimeric protein and is coded for by three loci: one mitochondrial locus
and two cytosolic loci. Hayward individuals, San Felipe individuals, and some San Diego
individuals exhibit a simple three-band pattern, one band for each isoform. The darkest
band on top is due to the mitochondrial isoform of MDH, and the two lighter bands below
are due to the two cytosolic isoforms of MDH. The second, faster cytosolic isoform
shows allelic variation in the San Diego population, with some individuals homozygous for
the slow allele, some heterozygous, and some homozygous for the fast allele.
The San Diego population did not significantly deviate from Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium expectations. This means that the assumptions underlying the HardyÂ¬
Weinberg Equilibrium, namely,: random mating between phenotypes, large population, no
selection between genotypes, no differential migration, and no mutation are generally
being met. This suggests that MDH is not under selection in San Diego. If it were being
selected upon, it could not be used as a marker for population structure and dynamics
because it would not be neutral.
The Hayward and San Felipe populations are fixed for the slow allele, suggesting
that there is very little or no gene flow among the three populations. The rationale behind
this conclusion is as follows: since the fast allele is not present in either the Hayward or
