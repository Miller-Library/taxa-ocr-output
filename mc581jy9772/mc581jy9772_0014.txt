San Felipe populations, neither of these populations is interbreeding with the San Diego
population. Since San Diego is located south of Hayward and north of San Felipe, it is
highly unlikely those two populations would interbreed with each other if they were not
interbreeding with the San Diego population, due to the geographic distance separating
them.
It should be noted that my sample sizes of 10, 30, and 8 for the Hayward, San
Diego, and San Felipe populations, respectively, are relatively small. It is possible that I
did not detect the fast allele in the Hayward and San Felipe populations simply because of
chance. However, Dr. Jen-jen Lin has also analyzed both San Diego and San Felipe
Gillichthys for MDH. Of the fisty individuals from San Felipe she analyzed, all had the
same simple pattern.
The MDH results are somewhat unexpected if one were looking for a temperature-
related cline; the samples in the coldest and warmest environments show no variation from
each other while the samples from the intermediate environment show variation from both.
There are several possible theories that could explain the presence of the fast allele
in San Diego only. One possibility is that the slow allele is actually the ancestral form and
the mutation for the fast allele is one that has occurred in the San Diego area only.
Another possibility is that the frequency of the fast allele is actually increasing among
Gillichthys farther south down the Pacific coast, but that I cannot see this effect because I
did not have any samples from the Pacific side of Baja California. If this were case, the
absence of the fast allele in San Felipe can be explained either by founder effect or by
random genetic drist. Founder effect means that the few fish that journeyed (geographic
movement would most likely be from oceanic dispersal of larvae rather than the swimming
