fragments, adapters, and enzymes coming into contact. It probably would also decrease
the likelihood of the adapters denaturing.
We added more Msel primer than EcoRl primer in the selective amplification and
labeling step for the same reasons that more Msel adapter is added than EcoRl adapter
Because Msel cuts much more frequently, there are many more Msel-Msel cut fragments.
Supplying more Msel primer ensured that there were adequate Msel primers for both the
many Msel-Msel cut fragments and the less abundant Msel-EcoRl cut fragments.
The PCR reaction for the selective amplification and labeling step was prepared on
ice. This was important to protect the Taq from denaturing and to prevent unplanned
reactions from occurring.
In summary, AFLP results may are consistent with a difference between the
Hayward and San Diego populations. AFLP was able to provide consistency within an
individual and to show variation between individuals, which suggests that it can be a
powerful technique. A downside of AFLP, however, is that it may require a lot of
modification before consistent and reliable results are obtained.
CONCLUSIONS
MDH results, which show the presence of a fast allele of the second cytosolic
isoform exclusively in San Diego individuals, provide some evidence that there is very
little or no gene flow between the Hayward, San Diego, and San Felipe populations of
Gillichthys mirabilis. The presence of the fast allele in San Diego may be explained by
several possible theories. Preliminary AFLP results, which suggest variation between the
Hayward and San Diego populations, do not disprove the no gene flow hypothesis.
