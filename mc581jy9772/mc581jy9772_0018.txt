However, more in-depth studies that include larger sample sizes, samples from more
locations, and analyses of more protein loci are required before definitive conclusions
about the population structure and dynamics of Gillichthys mirabilis can be drawn.
Finally, the ability of AFLP to provide consistency within individuals and show variation
between individuals suggests that this method has the potential to be a powerful DNA
fingerprinting technique. The original protocol, however, may require some modification
to make it suitable for the particular species being studied.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I received help from numerous people throughout this project and would like to
thank some of them here. Thanks to my advisors Dennis Powers and George Somero for
initiating the project and for their support throughout the quarter. A huge thanks to my
mentor Gary Villa for his patience, help, and support. Thanks to Jen-jen Lin, who taught
me the isozyme electrophoresis techniques and to Tzung Yang, who took me Gillichthys-
trapping. Trish Schulte and the other members of the Powers lab provided a lot of input
and support; thank you all. Thanks also to Tony DeTomaso for his help with AFLP and
to Grant Pogson for his DNA Salt Extraction protocol. Finally, I would like to thank
Maya Hayden, who was my partner in developing the AFLP technique, for her company
and support.
