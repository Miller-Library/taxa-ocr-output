a unique rate and appear as a unique band when visualized. Figures 9 and 10 show what
AFLP banding patterns might look like. The gel is visualized by autoradiography.
In summary, AFLP produces a banding pattern that is different for each individual,
but that is more similar between more closely related individuals. The function and origin
of each amplified fragment is not known. Different banding patterns can be produced for
the same individual by using primers with different random bases.
Differences between individuals can be evaluated by calculating a difference index
= + different bands/+ total bands. Pair-wise comparisons could then be made, and
populations compared, by using one way ANOVA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eight Gillichthys specimens were caught using baited minnow traps in the
estuaries around San Felipe, Mexico. Over thirty specimens each were caught in the same
manner from the estuaries around San Diego, California and in the Cargill salt ponds in
Hayward, California. The fish were kept in an aquarium which was filled with sea water at
ambient temperature (18° C). When the fish were needed for analysis, they were removed
from the aquarium and immediately stored in a -70° C freezer.
Isozyme Electrophoresis
As mentioned above, for the isozyme work the major steps involved extracting the
protein, resolving the proteins on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and staining the
gel for activity of the protein of interest (Lin, 1993) (Fig. 3). Two proteins were stained
for: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a glycolytic enzyme, and malate dehydrogenase
(MDH), an oxidative enzyme. We dissected approximately 0.25 grams of white muscle
