Hayward, 30 individuals from San Diego, and 8 individuals from San Felipe were
analyzed.
The San Diego population was tested for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (Appendix
1). It was the only population tested since it was the only one that exhibited variation.
The population was almost exactly in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, with a insignificant XÂ¬
test statistic of 0.1391 (critical value was 3.841) and expected values that matched the
observed values almost exactly. (18 homozygous slow, 10 heterozygous, and 2
homozygous fast were observed, while 17.8, 10.6, and 1.6 were the expected values.)
AFLP
Figure 9 shows a gel obtained when we were trying to optimize the AFLP
conditions. All the lanes are from the same sample, but each lane reflects different
reaction conditions. Each lane shows the same bands, although some bands are lighter in
some lanes than others.
Figure 10 shows a gel on which there are several different individuals. H2 and H3
are individuals from Hayward while SD14, SD17, and SD19 are from San Diego. The
two Hayward fish have bands in common with each other, as do the three San Diego
individuals. The Hayward and San Diego fish also have bands in common with each
other, yet there are also several distinct differences between the banding patterns. One
difference is the bands indicated on the San Diego individuals which are lacking in the
Hayward fish.
