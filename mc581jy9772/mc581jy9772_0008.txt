The gels were run in a 4Â° C cold room, at 12 mA until the dye reached the running
gel layer at which time the voltage was increased to 25 mA, or at 12 mA overnight and 25
mA for a few minutes before the gel was disconnected.
When the dye front had run off the bottom of the gel, the electrophoresis was
stopped, and the gel was removed from the apparatus for staining. I made staining
cocktails with the following reagents: for MDH, 44 mL pH 9.0 staining buffer (0.2 M
Tris-HCl), 10 mg NAD', 100 uL (1.25 mg) phenazine methosulfate (PMS), 2 mL nitro
blue tetrazolium (NBT), and 1 mL 2 ML-malate pH 7.0. For LDH, 45 mL pH 8.0
staining buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl), 10 mg NAD', 100 uL (1.25 mg) PMS, 2 mL NBT, and
110 uL lactic acid were mixed. The gel was placed in the staining solution at room
temperature until all the bands appeared; this usually required about 10 minutes. At this
point, the staining solution was replaced with dd HO and the gel was washed twice for 10
minutes.
AFLP
The main steps of AFLP were isolation of genomic DNA, double restriction digest,
ligation of adapters, preamplification, selective amplification and labeling, resolution on a
polyacrylamide gel, and visualization through autoradiography (Fig. 5). The protocol was
based upon the methods described by Vos, et al. (1995), and many of the modifications
were made upon suggestion by Tony DeTomasso.
Our main DNA extraction method was Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin C& T DNA
extraction from cells and tissue (see Macherey-Nagel for protocol). We also used a
phenol and 1:24 chloroform/isoamyl extraction method and a salt extraction method
