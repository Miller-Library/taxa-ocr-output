Figure 9 also shows promise, not in terms of population differences but in terms of
the reliability of AFLP. Figure 9 shows several lanes run with the same individual, with
each lane reflecting slightly different reaction conditions. That the lanes show the same
banding patterns, with only differences in the intensities of the bands, suggests that AFLE
was working as planned; that the fragments being amplified are the ones we want to
amplify, and are not just random fragments. If random fragments were being amplified,
the fragments and therefore the bands would not be consistent over several trials.
It should be noted that although we did produce promising AFLP results,
numerous modifications and optimization efforts were required before consistent results
were obtained. The modifications we made are included in the materials and methods, but
several which we found to be particularly important involved: the amount of DNA used,
the temperature of the ligation reaction, the concentration of primer, and the preparation
of the selective amplification and labeling step PCR reaction on ice.
Although technically the amount of restriction enzyme should determine how many
fragments are cut, we found that adjusting the DNA concentrations affected the results.
500 uM gave the best results for Gillichthys, but for my colleague Maya Hayden, who
was using the AFLP technique on the squid Loligo opalescens, 300 uM DNA gave the
best results. It is important that the concentration of DNA not be too high, because an
excess of DNA can inhibit AFLP by remaining uncut and thereby interfering with the
ligation reaction.
Decreasing the ligation temperature from 37Â° C for three hours to room
temperature overnight may also have improved our results. This modification produced a
less harsh environment which may have increased the likelihood of the proper DNA
