in the warm northern Sea of Cortez and that the isolation of the California and Sea of
Cortez fish from each other may have occurred relatively recently. The study of one
protein, however, is not enough to draw conclusions about population genetics; more in-
depth studies are needed. Cathleen Davies (personal communication) is currently studying
the population structure of Gillichthys using protein electrophoresis, but she has not yet
published her results. No one has used the more sensitive DNA techniques to study
Gillichthys's population structure.
We decided to use both isozyme electrophoresis and AFLP to analyze the samples
of Gillichthys. Studying the fish at both the protein and DNA levels provided several
advantages. Isozyme electrophoresis is an established method from which it would be
likely for me to get results in the short eight week time frame of this study. Using a DNA
technique on Gillichthys, however, provides the potential to detect differences that protein
work probably could not, since with DNA fingerprinting, many loci are easily studied at
once and post-translational effects are not a factor.
THEORY
Isozyme Electrophoresis
Isozyme electrophoresis involves three main steps: extraction of protein, resolution
of the protein on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and staining for the activity of the
protein of interest (Fig. 3). When proteins are subjected to gel electrophoresis, they
migrate different distances based mainly upon their net charge and size. A more
negatively charged, smaller protein will migrate faster.
