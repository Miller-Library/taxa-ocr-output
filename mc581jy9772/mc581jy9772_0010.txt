MgCh, 83 uL 2 M(NH2)SO4, 7 uL 14 M B-mercaptoethanol, and 173 uL dd HO
NaOH was then added to adjust the pH to 8.6.
When the preamplification cycles were complete, I ran 8 uL of the preamplification
solution on a 1% agarose gel to check the efficacy of the preamplification step. The
remaining 12 uL of the preamplification solution were diluted 1:20 with O.IXTE. 3 uL
of this diluted preamplification solution were mixed with 1 uL IOX PCR buffer, 1 uL 2
mM dNTP's, 0.25 uL 10 uM labeled EcoRl primer (random bases AGG or ACT), 0.25
UL 30 uM Msel primer (random bases TGA or TAC), 0.05 uL Taq, and 4.45 uL dd H2O
to give a total reaction volume of 10 uL. We prepared the reactions on ice, spun them for
a few seconds in a microfuge, transferred the samples back to ice, and then transferred the
samples directly into a PCR machine preheated to 95째 C. The 36 PCR cycles were as
indicated in Table 1.
The labeled EcoRl primers were prepared beforehand. For a 25 uL sample, 11.25
uL dd HO, 2.5 uL 100 uM primer stock, 2.5 uL polynucleotide kinase buffer, 7.5 uLy
5P ATP, and 1.25 uL T4 polynucleotide kinase (9.30 U/uL) were added together. The
solution was incubated at 37째 C for 30 minutes and then at 65째 C for 15 minutes. We then
stored the labeled primers in a lead pig in a freezer designated for radioactivity.
Aster the selective amplification and labeling step was completed, the samples were
prepared for loading. We added 10 uL loading dye to each sample and denatured the
samples at 95째 C for five minutes. We then transferred the samples to ice and loaded 5 ul
of each sample into the gel. The gel was run at 55 W until the first dye front ran
