ABSTRACT
Gillichthys mirabilis, the longjaw mudsucker, is a Gobiid fish that lives under a
wide variety of temperature ranges in bays and estuaries along the Pacific coast of North
America. A population genetics study could suggest whether genetic differences
associated with differential physiological adaptations have occurred. Samples of
Gillichthys mirabilis from three locations: Hayward, CA, San Diego, CA, and San Felipe,
Mexico, were analyzed using isozyme electrophoresis and Amplified Fragment Length
Polymorphism (AFLP), a recently developed DNA fingerprinting technique. Three
questions were posed: 1) Are the populations of Gillichthys mirabilis separate or
interbreeding? 2) If the populations are interbreeding, to what extent does interbreeding
occur?, and 3) Is AFLP a sensitive and reliable technique to use for a population genetics
study of this species?
In the isozyme work, staining for malate dehydrogenase revealed an allele that was
present only in the San Diego fish, suggesting little gene flow among the three
populations. Preliminary AFLP results show some differences between the Hayward and
San Diego samples, as well as the potential for AFLP to be a powerful technique. More
in-depth studies, however, will be needed to draw definitive conclusions about the
population structure of Gillichthys mirabilis
INTRODUCTION
Gillichthys mirabilis, the longjaw mudsucker, is a fish of the Gobiidae family. It is
commonly found in bays and estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America, from
Tomales Bay (about 50 miles north of San Francisco) to Baja California, as well as in the
