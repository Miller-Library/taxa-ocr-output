Because proteins with the same function that have been coded for by different loci
or by different alleles within a locus usually migrate at different rates and produce different
banding patterns, one can deduce the genotype of an individual for a particular protein
using isozyme electrophoresis. For example, the top section of Figure 4 shows a
monomeric protein. If an individual is homozygous for the faster allele, this is represented
by the single band which has migrated farther. If the individual is homozygous for the
slower allele, this is represented by the single band that has not migrated as far. Finally, if
the individual is heterozygous, it will have two bands, one for each allele. The situation is
similar for a dimeric protein, except that the heterozygote will have three bands: one for
each of the homodimers and one (the middle band) for the heterodimer, which consists of
one component of each of the homodimers. These patterns are due to allozymes, which
are encoded by allelic variations at a single locus. The situation increases in complexity
(five bands for the heterozygote of a tetrameric protein, etc.) as the number of subunits in
of the protein increases (Richardson et al., 1986).
With proteins that have more than one locus coding for them, each isozyme, as the
product of individual loci are called, will show a banding pattern as described above.
Proteins are present in different amounts in different tissue, so the number of and intensity
of isozymes will vary among tissue types (Richardson et al., 1986). In my study,
however, the same type of tissue was analyzed for each fish, so the type and intensity of
isozymes present should be similar.
The proteins are stained through a chemical reaction, where the enzyme of interest
catalyzes an oxidation-reduction reaction which is coupled with a dye (Richardson et al.,
1986)
