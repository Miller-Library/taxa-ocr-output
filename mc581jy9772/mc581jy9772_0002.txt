Sea of Cortez (Fields, 1995) (Fig. 1). Samples from three locations: Hayward, California,
San Diego, California, and San Felipe, Mexico (Fig. 2), were analyzed to determine
whether the populations at these locations were separate or interbreeding. Tused two
different methods to analyze the samples: isozyme electrophoresis, which enabled me to
study the samples at the protein level, and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism
(AFLP), a recently developed DNA fingerprinting technique. A third purpose of the
project was to determine whether AFLP is a sensitive and reliable technique for studying
population genetics of this species.
Gillichthys can reside under a wide range of temperature and water conditions. It
can burrow in the mud to regulate its body temperature, and has been known to survive at
temperatures as high as 35째 C, though it prefers temperatures from 9 to 23째 C (Love,
1991). The temperature of its natural habitat can vary greatly. Annual temperatures on
the coast of Northern California might range from 10 to 18째 C, while in the Sea of Cortez
the range might be from 9 to 30째C (Fields, 1995). Gillichthys can also survive in a wide
range of water conditions, ranging from water that is nearly fresh to water that is two and
a half times saltier than sea water (Love, 1991). A population genetics study of
Gillichthys might suggest differential physiological adaptations that have occurred among
Gillichthys populations, especially since it can live in such varied environments.
Current literature on the population genetics of Gillichthys is very limited. Fields
(1995) found no differences between the enzyme kinetics, amino acid sequences, and
CDNA sequences of Az lactate dehydrogenase in Gillichthys from the San Diego area and
the northern part of the Sea of Cortez. Based upon his studies, Fields suggests that
Gillichthys uses behavioral thermoregulation rather than biochemical adaptation to survive
