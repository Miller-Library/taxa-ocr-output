The double restriction digest was set up by incubating 500 uM DNA, 5 units
EcoRl, and 5 units Msel with 3 uL New England Biological (NEB) Buffer 2 and 3 uL
IOX NEB BSA. An appropriate amount of dd HO was added to make a final reaction
volume of 30 uL. Adapters (Vos et al., 1995) were ligated by incubating the double
digest product with the following reagents at room temperature overnight: 2 uL 20 mM
ATP, 4 uL 10X Boehringer-Mannheim ligation buffer, 1 uL 50 uM Msel adapter, 1 uL 5
MM EcoRl adapter, 1 uL Boehringer-Mannheim ligase, and 1 uL dd H2O. The single
strands of the adapters should be annealed together before use. This is done by heating
the appropriate concentration of adapter to 95° C for five minutes and letting the mixture
cool to room temperature before freezing it.
I made the preamplification reaction by first diluting the ligation product 2:3. 60
uL of O.IXTE (10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) were added to each
ligation product to make a total solution of 100 uL. Each preamplification reaction was
then made by mixing 2 uL 1OX PCR buffer, 2 uL 2 mM dNTP's, 0.5 uL 30 uM Msel
primer, 0.5 uL 30 uM EcoRI primer, 4 uL 2:3 diluted ligation reaction solution, 0.09 uL
Taq polymerase, and 10.91 uL dd H2O. The random bases for the Msel and EcoRl
primers were thymine and adenine, respectively. Before the PCR cycles were started, the
samples were heated at 72° C for two minutes. The PCR cycles were as follows: 94° C
for 45 seconds, 56° C for 45 seconds, and 72° C for 1 minute, all for twenty cycles. Al
mL solution of the lOX PCR buffer consists of 670 uL 1 M Trizma Base, 67 uL 1 M
