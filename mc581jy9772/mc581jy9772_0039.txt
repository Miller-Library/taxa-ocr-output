Figure 9-The lanes indicated are the same sample under different reaction conditions.
The lanes show identical banding patterns, with differences in the intensity of bands.
Figure 10 - There are differences between the banding patterns of Hayward individuals
(H2 and H3) and San Diego individuals (SD 14, SD17, and SD19).
Figure 11 - LDH gel with the simple, two-band pattern. These individuals are from San
Felipe and San Diego; however, all the individuals sampled from the three location
exhibited this same pattern.
Figure 12 -MDH gel with Hayward samples. Each individual has the same, three-band
pattern.
Figure 13 - MDH gel with San Felipe samples. As with the Hayward samples, each
individual has the same, three-band pattern.
Figure 14 - MDH gel with San Felipe and San Diego individuals. The San Diego
individuals show variation at the second cytosolic isoform. SDI is homozygous for the
slow allele, SD2 is heterozygous, and SD3 is homozygous for the fast allele.
