tissue from each individual. The tissue was ground in 0.75 mL of homogenization buffer,
which consisted of 20% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.0), and 3 mM B¬
mercaptoethanol. The homogenized samples were spun in a 4° C centrifuge at 14000 g
for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The supernatant was immediately removed and stored on ice or
in a 4° C refrigerator until used. If the supernatant was stored for more than a few hours
before use, it was centrifuged again for 30 minutes at 14000 g immediately before use.
The polyacrylamide gel was composed of two layers: the running gel and the
stacking gel. The stacking gel solution for one gel was composed of 3.56 mL double
distilled (dd) H2O, 1.50 mL 4X stacking gel buffer (0.5 M Trizma base, pH 6.9), 0.60 mL
30% acrylamide/1% bis-acrylamide, 6 uL TEMED, and 40 uL 10% ammonium persulfate.
The running gel solution for one gel was made up of 4.725 mL dd HO, 4.125 mL 4X
running gel buffer (1.5 M Trizma base, pH 8.0), 4.125 mL 30% acrylamide/1% bis¬
acrylamide, 8.25 uL TEMED, and 0.15 mL 10% ammonium persulfate (Lin, 1993). The
running gel was poured into the gel plates and allowed to polymerize. The stacking gel
solution was then poured onto the polymerized running gel.
To resolve the samples, we placed the gel in a gel rack and filled the chambers with
electrophoretic buffer. The type of electrophoretic buffer varied depending on the protein
we planned to stain. For MDH the buffer consisted of 191 uM glycine, titrated with
Trizma base to pH 8.95, while for LDH the buffer was titrated to a pH of 8.3. I prepared
the sample solutions by adding 15 uL of loading buffer to 40 uL of the supernatant.
Blank solutions with water instead of supernatant were also prepared. For MDH gels, 55
uL of sample solution were loaded, while for LDH gels 25 uL were loaded.
