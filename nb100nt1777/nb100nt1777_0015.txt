through cortical granule exocytosis, then elevation of a section of the
membrane would seem an abnormal event. The abnormality of the event
is increased if the model which proposes a self-propagating cascade is
correct (figure 1). One could explain partial activation consistently if a
diffusible factor is needed above a certain concentration in order to cause
calcium release from the entire egg. In this case, a partial activation could
mean that the activating factor is simply not present in a high enough
concentration to release calcium beyond a given distance from point of
fusion or microinjection. Microinjection of both IPa and cGMP will result in
primarily partial membrane elevation if the concentration is ten-fold less
than that giving all complete activation (Ciapa, personal communication).
Thus if we believe in a a diffusible activator, finding partial activation
urges that the extract be concentrated in the hopes of increasing the
amount of factor above the threshold.
A second explanation for partial activation is the existance of not
one but two or even several factors which act in different ways to trigger
activation. For example, there may be a locally acting factor which causes
the partial activation while a second factor is needed to begin the self-
propagating wave. In this case, our extract may contain only one of the
necessary components of full activation. Again concentrating the solution
might result in our finding full activity, especially as multiple factors could
exist in smaller amounts and achieve a result through amplification.
