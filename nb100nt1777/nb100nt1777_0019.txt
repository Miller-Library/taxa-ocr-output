was performed using the first Triton buffer (see table 1) and without
spinning the sperm suspension at 100,000 g. The second triton
experiment (Triton 2) also used the first Triton buffer, this time with
the centrifugation step. The control in both of these experiments is
the lysis buffer diluted into the microinjection buffer at the same
ratio used with the sample. Triton 3 used the second triton buffer
(see table 1) and centrifugation, followed by desalting on the
Sephadex G-25 column and then drying using the Speed Vac.
Controls here include lysis buffer and the blanks of column fractions
without proteins also dried and then redisolved in microinjection
buffer. The fourth Triton experiment also used Triton buffer 2. This
time concentration was accomplished using ammonium sulfate
precipitation at 90% saturation with the salt.
The first three experiments with hypotonic treatment, followed
by extraction buffer all used the first composition of extraction
buffer as listed in table 1. Controls here are the extraction buffer
itself, made visible by adding carboxyfluorescein directly. For all
three of these experiments the fertilization rate when sperm were
added was very low among injected eggs. Thus for the last
experiment, a second extraction buffer composition was used with
lower EGTA, while excess calcium was removed by washing.
