Desalting followed by lyophilization and ammonium sulfate
precipitation were used to concentrate the extract. Using lyophilization
resulted in concentrations of 19 and 23 mg/ml protein in the injection
buffer, a significant increase. However, this may not have been enough.
The hypotonic permeabilization resulted in a much more dilute extract at
77 mg/ml, but it probably did not contain nuclear proteins, such as
histones, or membrane proteins, making it perhaps more concentrated in
the relevant cytoplasmic factors. In order to concentrate these extracts
further, the procedure would have to be modified to avoid concentrating
KCl and the difficulties in lypohilization solved first.
Lyophilizing, while it avoided heat, presented additional technical
problems since the activity could be lost by denaturation with the loss of
salt. The desalting column was eluted with ammonium bicarbonate so that
the proteins could be dried and concentrated without also increasing salt
and buffer concentrations. Unfortunately, the dried proteins did not fully
redissolve in the buffer, indicating that in fact there could have been
significant denaturation. The ammonium sulfate was used as an
alternative method of concentrating without drying; yet that extraction
also failed to activate microinjected eggs.
Despite the lack of activation in the one ammonium sulfate
experiment, work could be done to improve the procedure. The extract
was made with a small volume of sperm and perhaps a greater volume,
