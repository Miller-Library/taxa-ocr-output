Figure 1: Model for activation of the egg through a G-protein-linked
receptor. Binding of sperm to the putative receptor activates a GÂ¬
protein which diffuses through the membrane to activate
phospholipase C. This enzyme cleaves polyphosphatidyl inositol in
the membrane to generate IPa and DAG. IP releases calcium from
internal stores while DAG activates protein kinase C. Calcium feeds
back to increase PLC activity and, together with the rise in pH,
increases protein synthesis and causes the other events of activation.
Figure 2: Three models for the action of a diffusible factor in activating
the egg. Such a factor could trigger a self-propagating cascade, such
as the cascade proposed to accompany receptor mediated activation
(figure 1). Alternatively the factor itself could diffuse through out
the egg and cause calcium release directly. Finally, the factor might
act locally to release a greater amount of a diffusible factor from the
egg. For example, the sperm factor might cause an amplified local
production of IPz which would then diffuse through the cytoplasm
and activate the egg.
Table 1: Composition of all buffers used in the experiments described.
Trial 1 refers to the experiments with Triton as the primary means
of solubilizing. Trial 2 buffers are those into which sperm were
placed for extraction after having been swollen with 1 mM MgCl, 10
mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5.
