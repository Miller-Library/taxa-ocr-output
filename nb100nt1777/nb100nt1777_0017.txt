followed by fractionation as opposed to mass precipitation, could give a
cleaner extract with more likelihood of activating eggs if the factor exists.
A second potential improvement could be the use of detergents other than
Triton. Not all detergents are alike in what they will solubilize and
perhaps octylglucoside or another detergent would successfully solubilize
the activity where Triton had failed. Such a detergent would have the
additional advantage of being removable through dialysis, a much gentler
way of removing small molecules than the desalting column. Given the
possibility that the model might be wrong, in future experiments, it would
be worthwhile to try applying extracts to the outside of eggs from which
the vitelline layer had been removed.
