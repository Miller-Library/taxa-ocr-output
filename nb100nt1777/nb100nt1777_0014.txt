observed.
Even if the extraction procedure is successful, activation may not be
observed if the factor is not present in high enough concentrations. Sperm
are very small cells with little cytoplasm and would therefore be expected
to contain only a small amount of factor. However, sperm have an
advantage over microinjection in acting very locally. Fusion followed by
diffusion would result in a very high effective concentration immediately
adjacent to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the pipet tip goes farther
into the cell than adjacent to the membrane, and the injection pressure
sends the microinjected solution in towards the center of the cell. It
follows that a higher concentration of material would therefore have to be
microinjected in order to achieve the same effective concentration at the
membrane as a single fusing sperm achieves. Assuming that the entire
sperm head contains the activating factor and that our procedure resulted
in 100% recovery, we calculated that the microinjection in the first Triton
extraction could be equivalent to 10 to 30 sperm. Since neither
assumption is true, and even this estimate is fairly low, lack of
concentration is certainly a valid consideration.
A second reason for assuming that concentration could be an
important variable is the partial activations which were occasionally
observed. The meaning of a partial activation is hard to assess. If there is
nothing wrong with the egg, so that it is capable of raising a membrane
