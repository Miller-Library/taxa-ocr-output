section will trace through the procedural variations tried along with the
effects of each experiment.
To begin all Triton extraction experiments, 4 to 8 ml sperm were
suspended in glycine rinse (see table 1 for composition of all buffers) and
then centrifuged. The rinse was repeated three times to remove sea
water, semen proteins and salts which might contaminate the extraction
buffer. Lysis buffer was then added to the sperm and the suspension was
mixed slowly for 2 hrs at 4 C. Following lysis, the sperm suspensions were
centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 hr at 4Â° C to remove DNA and undissolved
components. The supernatant was collected and became the crude extract
for microinjection.
Later experiments tried to purify and concentrate the extract for
reasons which will be discussed below. The first approach to concentrating
the extract was to separate out the small molecules on a Sephadex G-25
desalting column eluted with ammonium bicarbonate, and then to
evaporate the elutant to leave a protein pellet to be redissolved in a few
hundred microliters of microinjection buffer. Twenty drop fractions were
collected and a spot assay (5ul from each tube spotted on Whatman filter
paper and developed five minutes in Comassie blue) performed to idetify
tubes with proteins. Those with protein were pooled, dried and
redissolved in a few hundred microliters of fluorescent microinjection
buffer. The second method concentrated extracts by adding ammonium
