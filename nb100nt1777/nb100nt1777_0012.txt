EGTA, which buffers calcium release during the fertilization events, and so
prevents the calcium-dependent cortical granule exocytosis. No
concentration of EGTA could serve its original function of effectively
buffering the extra calcium from hypotonic solution and sperm which
remained in the pellet and at the same time not be too high for
microinjection itself (in which case it would buffer the activation calcium
wave). Therefore the procedure was modified to remove excess calcium
by rinsing the sperm three times in the hypotonic solution (each
resuspension followed by centrifugation in the Sorvall) before adding the
extraction buffer, now at 0.1 mM EGTA (trial 2, comp 2 in table 1). Even
under these conditions microinjection did not seem to activate the eggs,
although the high background activity in controls made it difficult to know
if a low level of activation activity was present. Twenty one injections of
extract included six partial membranes, but even the microinjection buffer
itself gave 30% activations with this batch of eggs.
Discussion
There are at least three possible reasons why the procedures
described above have failed to demonstrate the existence of a spermÂ¬
derived, diffusible activating factor. Most obvious is that the activity may
not exist. However, the methods have potential weaknesses which may be
responsible for the negative results. First, it is possible that the
