cause microinjected eggs to reproduce the occilations of calcium
characteristic of activated hamster eggs. The experiments described here
explored various protocols for solubilizing sperm in an attempt to describe
a sperm-derived activating factor. Based on the results discussed above,
this search focussed on a protein which could act as a diffusible messenger
from the sperm cytoplasm to the egg cytoplasm.
Materials and Methods
Gametes: Eggs were collected by shaking and then inverting S
purpuratus females over sea water. The eggs were stored in a 16° C water
bath with gentle stirring and were used in experiments within four hours
of collection. Sperm were collected dry from males microinjected with a
small amount of 5M KCl into the body cavity. Sperm were stored at 4° C
and were generally used within 24 hours of collection.
Extractions: Sea urchin sperm cannot be homogenized easily to
release cytoplasmic proteins. Instead, two methods of extraction were
used to bring soluble molecules into solution. The "brute force" method
employed a 1% Triton lysis buffer while the "finesse" method
permeabilized sperm in hypotonic but inert conditions and then extracted
presumably only cytoplasmic proteins in a high salt, high pH buffer.

briefly outline the strategy of each method here and, as the primary
results of the experiments were modifications in procedure, the next
