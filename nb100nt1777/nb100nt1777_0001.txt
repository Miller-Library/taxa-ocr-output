Abstract
Two competing models have been proposed to explain the
mechanism by which a sperm activates an egg at fertilization. One
postulates a receptor while the other relies on fusion as the primary means
of signal transduction. This study looked for a soluble activation factor
which could act as a diffusible messenger between the fused sperm and
egg. S purpuratus sperm were lysed with 1% Triton to bring all
solubilizable proteins and factors into solution. In a second set of
experiments, sperm were permeabilized with hypotonic solution and then
suspended in an extraction buffer of high salt and pH 8, designed to bring
only soluble cytoplasmic elements into solution. Both sets of extracts were
microinjected into eggs and activation was monitored by looking for the
rise of the fertilization membrane. Under the various conditions used in
this study, no soluble fraction from sperm activated the eggs when
microinjected.
Introduction
We tend to think of fertilization as the beginning of the development
of a new organism, despite the fact that reproduction is a cyclical process,
as that old adage about the chicken and the egg illustrates so aptly. But
fertilization does give the impression of a beginning, even on the molecular
level. This is especially true when we look at sea urchins. Eggs from these
