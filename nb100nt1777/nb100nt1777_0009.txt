viewed on a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope and successful
microinjections were monitored using the fluorescein filter set. The assay
for activation in the experiments presented here was the rise of the
fertilization membrane within about a minute of injection. Only eggs in
which the pipet entry did not itself cause visible damage were counted in
these experiments. Every experiment included the control injection of the
relevant buffer without sperm proteins. As a positive control for
fertilizability of the eggs, including those which had been microinjected,
each plate of eggs was fertilized by viable sperm after microinjections
were completed with that batch. In general, no batch of eggs remained
under the microscope for longer than 45 minutes.
Results
None of the extraction procedures described above resulted in a
solution which activated microinjected eggs. In this section I want to
explain the changes made in the protocol as the study went along and at
the same time look at the actual numbers of injections versus activations,
which are summarized in table 2.
Triton Extacts The composition of the original 1% Triton buffer
contained glycerol and inhibitors of proteases and phophatases to protect
proteins from degradation due to enzymes released during lysis and to
increase stability of proteins. Seven microinjections of extract resulted in
