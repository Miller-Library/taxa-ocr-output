animals remain in a relatively quiescent metabolic state until fertilization.
Fusion of the two gametes and the transfer of paternal genetic material is
accompanied by the reinitiation of the cell cycle and an increase in egg
metabolism, DNA and protein synthesis.
As a problem of signal transduction, this activation of the egg is
compelling, since so many aspects of the cell are affected. Two very early
events which are thought to be central to reinitiating protein synthesis and
metabolism are the wave of intracellular calcium release which crosses the
egg and the increase in cytoplasmic pH. Calcium especially has been
manipulated in experiments with fertilization or parthenogenic activation
(Whitaker and Steinhart, 1985; Swann and Whitaker, 1986; Turner et al,
1986; Steinhart and Epel, 1974; Steinhart et al, 1977; Brandriff et al, 1975).
These seem to demonstrate its importance as a fundamental component of
egg activation. But the calcium rise itself is not the initiating signal;
inositol trisphosphate (IP3) seems to be the messenger responsible for
releasing calcium from internal stores (Swann and Whitaker, 1986, Swann
et al, 1987; Busa et al, 1985). There is one report claiming that IP3 itself
could be released from the sperm after fusion and so activate the egg
directly (Iwasa et al, unpublished). Others have observed a turnover of
egg plasma membrane inositol lipids during early fertilization (Ciapa and
Whitaker, 1986) and propose that IP3 is a second messenger. If this is
true the question becomes how the sperm initiates IPa generation. In any
