one partial activation, while five injections of the buffer alone, raised no
membranes. The presence of a partial activation indicated that a higher
concentration might be necessary to find the activity, since low
concentration injections of IPa and cGMP result in partial membranes also
(Ciapa, personal communication).
The first concentration was performed in the speed-vac. Glycerol
was left out of the lysis buffer (Triton 2 in table 1). The extract was
desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column eluted with 10 mM ammonium
bicarbonate, which was expected to evaporate during drying. The dried
proteins were redissolved in the microinjection buffer. As table 2
illustrates, the lysis buffer resulted in low background partial activation,
while injections of dried G-25 fractions without proteins resulted in six
non-activated eggs. The extract injections had encouraging results: in one
set of 8 injections, three were partially and one was fully activated. In a
second set of injections, six of nine eggs had strangely flattened sides
where they had been round originally. This happened again later with one
of the hypotonic extractions and its interpretation is uncertain. The shape
of the eggs resembled that of partially activated eggs but they lacked the
membrane.
In order to see whether the extract could be concentrated by an
additional ten-fold, as Ciapa's experiments with IPz indicated might be
necessary, the procedure was repeated with greater volumes of sperm.
