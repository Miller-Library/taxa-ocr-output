procedures used failed to bring the relevant factor into solution. Second,
the relevant factor may be in the extracts, only in concentrations too low
for the microinjected solution to imitate the effects of the sperm during
fertilization. Finally, the purification and concentration which was
attempted may have resulted in denaturation and loss of activity.
It is possible that the factor was not pulled into solution. If, for
example the factor is transferred between the two gametes plasma
membranes and so is lipophilic, not hydrophilic. These experiments
searched for proteins rather than lipids because Swannâ€™s results in
hamster indicate that an activating protein can be isolated from the sperm
in that system. At the same time, it is important to remember that species
vary, so sea urchins may not use a protein.
There is ground to criticize the hypotonic permeabilization as likely
not to have brought the factor into solution. Although at least some
number of proteins were extracted, there was also loss of proteins in the
rinses which preceded the extraction buffer. It is interesting to note that
the two reports of isolated sperm factors in the literature use very simple
techniques. Swann (1990) extracts directly into hypotonic solution and
Dale et al (1985) isolate their product in distilled water. I did not repeat
the Dale et al procedure partly because proteins tend not to be stable in
distilled water but largely because it seems likely that there is enough
calcium in the final injection medium to cause the activation they
