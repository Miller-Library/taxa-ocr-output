For these next two experiments extracts were lyophilized instead of
evaporated in the Speed Vac to prevent denaturation by heating.
Unfortunately, after this treatment, the proteins did not redissolve easily,
making microinjection impossible due to the particulate nature of the
sample.
The final approach to concentrating Triton extracts used ammonium
sulfate salt added to 90% to precipitate and thus separate proteins from
the lysis buffer. The precipitate was then resuspended in a small volume
of the microinjection buffer and dialyzed to remove excess salt. In nine
microinjections, one activated, which seemed due to the injection itself, not
the buffer.
Hypotonic Extraction The second extraction strategy did not result
in a very concentrated solution. Presumably, however, it was enriched in
the activating factor. These experiments were based on Tilney's (1979)
description of hypotonic solutions which swell the sperm without lysing
them, and his observation that actin in the acrosomal vesicle is inert if
swollen sperm are left at pH 6.5, but goes into solution at pH 8. The first
two experiments used 10 mM EGTA in the extraction buffer (Trial 2,
compl in table 1) which was added after removing the hypotonic solution.
While many eggs were injected without activation, the general rate of
fertilization when sperm were added was poor among the injected eggs.
The poor fertilization could be attributed to too high a concentration of
