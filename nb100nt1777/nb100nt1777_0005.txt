membranes is the first event of fertilization. However, dye transfer and
EM experiments first detect fusion 4 to 8 seconds after the initial contact
(Hinkley et al, 1986; Longo et al, 1986) implying that cytoplasmic
continuity is not necessarily the first event. Whitaker et al (1989) try to
resolve the discrepancy which a complex model involving transient fusion
which becomes permanent later by the action of calcium, released locally
by the diffusible activating factor from the sperm. Despite the intricacies
of their model, it does not constitute evidence for the existence of the
putative activating factor. If an activating factor exists, its activity could
be found in and presumably purified from solubilized sperm cytoplasm.
Isolating an activity would be the best possible demonstration of the
model.
Several small molecules, including calcium, cGMP and IPz are known
to activate eggs when microinjected, but there are reasons to believe none
of these are the relevant diffusible messenger. The biggest problem with
using any of these in a model is the high concentration at which they
would need to be present to play the role of diffusible activator. For
example, Whitaker predicts that cGMP would have to be present in sperm
at approximately 1M to be effective (Whitaker and Crossley, in press).
There have been two reports of activity isolated in sperm extracts:
one in hamster (Swann, 1990) and the other in sea urchin (Dale et al,
1985). Swann has reported the isolation of a sperm protein which will
