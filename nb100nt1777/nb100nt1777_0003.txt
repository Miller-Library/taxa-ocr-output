case, the question which is still to be answered asks about the nature of
the initiating signal of activation.
Two models are generally presented to account for the mechanism of
egg activation. The first postulates a receptor-mediated signal between
the sperm and the egg. The second proposes a diffusible activating factor
which enters the egg after fusion establishes cytoplasmic continuity. In its
most common version, this model draws an analogy with the IP second
messenger system in other cells (Berridge and Irvine, 1984). The
proposed receptor would activate a G-protein which in turn activates
phospholipase C to cleave membrane phosphatidyl inositols into IP3 and
diacylglycerol (figure 1). Experiments in sea urchins (Swann and
Whitaker, 1986; Turner et al, 1986) and Xenopus (Busa et al, 1985) have
demonstrated that microinjected IPa will cause calcium release and the
calcium-dependent cortical granule exocytosis. In addition, the
cytoplasmic concentration of IPa increases during fertilization (Ciapa and
Whitaker, 1986), suggesting that IPa is a relevant messenger in vivo.
The existence of a receptor and G-protein are much more dubious.
Kline et al (1985) found that Xenopus oocytes expressing muscarinic
acetylcholine or serotonin receptors could be artificially activated by
neurotransmitter. Since the receptors couple to G-proteins, their ability to
trigger activation indicates the existence of endogenous G-proteins with
the ability to cause calcium release. However, the physiological relevance
