of the experiment is unclear. Experiments which tried to manipulate the
G-protein with toxins or GTP analogs have given ambiguous results.
Microinjection of GTP-B-S, a G-protein inhibitor, will inhibit cortical granule
exocytosis as a result of fertilization by sperm (Turner et al, 1986). The
same injections will also inhibit cortical granule exocytosis by
microinjected IP3. As the inhibitor of the G-protein must be acting after
the release of calcium, the G-protein itself cannot therefore be responsible
for the calcium wave (Whitaker and Crossley, in press; Turner et al,
communication). The receptor model is certainly attractive for its
elegance: a receptor mediated event sets off a self-propagating wave of
1P3 generation and calcium release while DAG activates protein kinase C,
raising pH and perhaps even causing membrane fusion. However, the
failure to demonstrate a critical role for G-proteins early in activation in
vivo seriously undermines the strength of this model.
In the alternative model, fusion of sperm and egg allows the
diffusion of an activating factor into the egg cytoplasm. This factor could
act in a number of ways, either acting locally to set off the IPa cascade or
to release some egg factor, or by diffusing itself to release calcium from the
eggâ€™s internal stores (figure 2). An increase in membrane capacitance can
be measure almost simultaneously with the sperm-gated
hyperpolarization, that is to say from the initiation of sperm-egg contact
(McCulloh and Chambers, 1986). This implies that fusion of the plasma
