sulfate to 90% saturation to precipitated proteins. The precipitate was
collected, redissolved in microinjection buffer and then dialysed overnight
to remove the excess ammonium sulfate.
To permeabilize sperm without detergent, 1 ml dry sperm was
diluted into 12 ml of 25% sea water (75% distilled water) and then 8 or 10
mi 1 mM MgCl, 10 mM phosphate, pH 6.5, was added to completely swell
at least 90% of the sperm. Suspensions were centrifuged at 3000g for 5
minutes in a Sorvall centrifuge and the supernatant removed. The sperm
were re-suspended in a high salt, pH 8 buffer (table 1, trial 2) to solubilize
proteins. Sperm were mixed slowly at 4 C for 30 minutes and then spun at
3000g in an Eppendorf variable centrifuge. Supernatant was collected and
carboxyfluoresceine added to aid visualization during microinjection.
Microinjections: Jelly coats were first removed from the eggs by
passing them through a 90 micrometer Nitex mesh filter three times. De¬
jellied eggs were stuck to plastic Petri dishes coated with protamine sulfate
(3 or 5 mg/ml in distilled water). Dishes were then placed on a water-
cooled microscope stage (16° C). The sample to be microinjected was
loaded into a pipet pulled from 1 mm capillary tubes at 15 amps on à
Nargishe micropipet puller (Scientific Instruments Inc). Pipets were
mounted on a micromanipulator and pressure was delivered using a hand¬
built air valve at 35 psi for approximately 100ms. This generally resulted
in a delivered volume equal to about 1% of the egg's volume. Eggs were
