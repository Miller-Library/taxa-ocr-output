(Summers and Smith, 1987). For infections, log-phase cells were seeded in
culture dishes at 10' cells/cm2 and allowed to settle for 30-60 minutes. The
media was then removed, and fresh media was added. Infected cells were
maintained at 18°0
Electrophysiology.
Recordings from Sf9 cells at 18°0 and GFL neurons at 12°0 were
made using standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques. All recordings
were made from cells at a holding potential of -80 mV, with linear capacity
and ionic currents subtracted online using a standard P/-4 technique.
Recordings were sampled at 2 kHz or 20 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. The
recording solutions had the following compositions (in mM): 150K Sf9
Intemal, 20 KCI, 50 KF, 80 K-Glutamate, 10 Lysine-Hepes, 1 EGTA, 1
EDTA, 26.2 Glycine, 85 Sucrose, 4 Mg-ATP, 4.12 TMA-OH, pH 7.0; 20K
Sf9 external, 20 KCI, 168 Nacl, 10 Cacl,, 10 MgCl, 10 MgSO,, 5 Hepes,
1.6 NaÖH, pH 7.2; 150K GFL intemal, 20 KCI, 50 KF, 80 K-Glutamate, 10

used to block Na’ current, and in some cells 0.8 uM CdCI, was used to
block Ca“ current.
