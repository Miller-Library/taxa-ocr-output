studies have identified specific residues in the Shaker B Kâ€œ channel critically
important for binding charybdotoxin, a scorpion toxin similar to TSTX-Ka
(Figure 1) (Goldstein and Miller, 1992; Mackinnon and Miller, 1989;
Mackinnon et al., 1990). One of these residues (F425), when mutated to
glycine, led to a 2000-fold increase in toxin affinity, indicating this residue's
importance in mediating toxin binding (Goldstein et al., 1994).
The amino acid sequence of the Shaker Kt channel is similar to that of
SqkviA in the pore-forming region, except at 3 positions (Rosenthal et al.,
1996, in press). One of these is histidine (H351 in SgkviA) instead of the
F425 of Shaker. It is very plausible that this residue mediates pH
dependence of TsTX-Ka block by the degree to which the amino side chains
are protonated according to the model:
a-subunit - His + Ht
a-subunit - His
(inaccessible to toxin binding)
The sigmoidal curve in Figure 6 is practically identical to the titration curve for
histidine with a pK, of 6.02 (Lehninger, 1970). Therefore, as the proportion of
protonated histidine residues increases with decreasing pH, the amount of
block decreases by the same amount.
Interactions of charged residues with toxin binding at position F425 in
Shaker have been previously identified. Gross and Mackinnon (1996) have
shown that a single molecule of the peptide agitoxin-2, when bound to a
single a-subunit of the Shaker K+ channel, is sufficient to completely block
the channel. If this is also true in the case in the TsTX-Ka and the SgkviA
channel in GFL neurons, protonation of 1, 2, or 3 of the 4 a-subunit H351
