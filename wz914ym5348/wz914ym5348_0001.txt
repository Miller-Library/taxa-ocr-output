ABSTRACT
Tityustoxin-Ka (TSTX-Ka) is a 37 amino acid peptide component of
the venom of the scorpion, Tityus serrulatus, and blocks voltage-gated K
current (1) in highly specific channel types. TsTX-Ka is structurally similar to
charybdotoxin, agitoxin-2, and other scorpion toxins that bind to the
extracellular surface of the pore-forming region of Kvi-type (Shaker)
channels. The action of TsTX-Ka was studied on squid Kt channels using
the whole-cell patch clamp technique with dissociated giant fiber lobe (GFL)
neurons and with insect Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus carrying the
CDNA for the corresponding channel (Brock et al., 1996). Under standard
conditions (12Â°0, pH 7.6, 20 mM external K*), TsTX-Ka reduces l for a
strong voltage step (+40 mV) in GFL neurons with an estimated Kp of 50
nM. Steady state voltage dependence and activation kinetics of residual ly
are minimally affected in 300 nM TSTX-Ka, but inactivation kinetics are
accelerated. Similar results were obtained in SF9 cells. Block of I, in GFL
neurons by TSTX-ka (300 nM) depends on external pH. Less block occurs
at low pH, with half-block occurring at pH 6.0, approximately the pK, of
histidine (6.02). This amino acid is located in the SgkviA channel (H351) at
a position homologous to F425 in Shaker B, a residue critical to binding of
charybdotoxin (Goldstein, et al., 1994) and agitoxin-2 (Gross & Mackinnon,
1996). These results suggest that H351 in the external mouth of the squid
SqkviA channel is also a determinant of TsTX-ka binding, and that
protonation of the side chain of this residue may decrease toxin sensitivity by
electrostatic repulsion.
