properties were ascertained by measuring the change in current evoked
upon repolarization (to -80 mV) from a series of voltage steps to test
potentials between -50 mV and +60 mV and dividing by the voltage change
(dI/dV). All measurements were normalized to the maximum conductance
value under each condition. Conductances are not markedly changed in
toxin, indicating that the voltage dependence of the channels were
unaffected by toxin.
Figure 4 Inactivation is faster and more complete in 300 nM TSTX-Ka (pH
7.6). Kt current recordings are shown after 0, 11, 20, and 40 minutes in
toxin. Current was activated by 250 ms depolarizing voltage steps from
-80 mV to +40 mV. Each sweep is scaled to match the peak current level in
the control recording. Scaling factors are shown in parenthesis. The time
constant (t) decreases from 125 ms in control solution, to 68.9 ms after 40
min in 300 nM TSTX-Ka. In addition to the rate of inactivation, the amount of
current at any time point is less than that in control, indicating that more
current inactivates in toxin.
Figure 5 A delayed time course of block and faster inactivation kinetics are
also seen in Sf9 insect cells expressing SgkviA channels, the main
component of Kt current in GFL neurons. (A) 300 nM TSTX-Ka applied at
time zero blocks Kâ€œ current in Sf9 cells to a lesser extent than in GFL
neurons. However, the slow rate of toxin effect seen in GFL cells is also
exhibited in Sf9 cells. The half-time to block is 2-3 min in Sf9 (3-4 min in
GFL). Peak Kt current was elicited using depolarizing voltage steps from
