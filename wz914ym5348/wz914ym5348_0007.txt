Tityustoxin-Ka causes potent block of lg in GFL neurons.
When applied to GFL neurons, 300 nM TSTX-Ka blocked 86% of
peak GFL K“ current activated by a strong depolarization to +40mV (Figure
2). A Kp was estimated using the equation:
Ko
fractional block =
300 nM + Kp
Requiring such a relatively high concentration, GFL Ig is considerably less
sensitive to TsTX-Ka than is lg in other cell types. For example, in cloned
Kv1.2 channels expressed in B82 fibroblast cells, half-block occurs at
0.21 nM, 2.4 orders of magnitude less than in SgkviA (Werkman et al,
1993). The time course of toxin effect appeared to be very slow, with half¬
block occurring after 3-4 minutes and maximum block after 33 minutes. A
single exponential (t = 8.9 min) fit these data reasonably well. Reversal
was slow (220 min) and incomplete, but these effects were not studied in
detail. A similar slowly developing effect of toxin at this concentration also
occurs with lg in perfused squid giant axons (Gilly, personal communication).
TSTX-Ka did not significantly affect activation properties (Figure 3).
Residual lg in 300 nM TSTX-Ka could be scaled such that the time course of
activation closely resembled that in control recordings (Figure 3A).
Deactivation kinetics, measured by fitting a single exponential to the tail
current evoked after a prepulse to +40mV, were not substantially altered by
TsTX-Ka (Figure 3B). Similarly, the voltage dependence of l activation was
largely unaffected (Figure 30).
TsTX-Ka did, however, tend to make inactivation faster and more
complete, particularly with increasing toxin exposure time. Ig records taken
