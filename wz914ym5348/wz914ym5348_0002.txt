INTRODUCTION
Kt channels are remarkably diverse. With more channel types than
any other ion channel studied, the literature has quickly grown confusing with
competing nomenclature and classification schemes (Rudy, 1988). The
ability to separate Kt currents on the basis of pharmacology, kinetics
genetics, and other methods has indicated the presence of many different K
channel types, often within a single cell. The process of identifying and
characterizing individual channel types has been aided by a molecular
biological approach. A single K“ channel gene can be expressed in a
number of model expression systems which lack background Kt channels in
order to record currents produced by a single defined channel type.
However, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to isolate macroscopic currents
of a single K“ channel type from a cell exhibiting many different K“ currents
without more specific pharmacological probes than are presently available
Certain toxins, however, may hold the key to this need for specificity.
Small peptide toxins from the venom of snakes, spiders, and scorpions
have been found to produce block at nanomolar concentrations of highly
specific K“ channel subtypes (both voltage-gated and Ca2t-activated)
(Dreyer, 1990; Strong, 1990). Many scorpion toxins, in particular, have been
found to exhibit substantial structural similarity with one another. In each of
the toxin sequences shown in Figure 1, there are 6 cysteine residues located
at highly conserved positions (Garcia et al., 1994), suggesting that each
peptide may share the same arrangement of disulfide bonds and, therefore
similar tertiary structures. Based on similarities of structure, these toxins may
