Scorpion Toxins.
Tityustoxin-Ka, a-dendrotoxin, and pandinustoxin were kindly provided by
Dr. M. P. Blaustein and D. R. Matteson, Dept. of Physiology, Univ. of
Maryland. Stock solutions of toxin (50-250 uM) in H,O were stored in plastic
microtubes at 4°0. Toxins were diluted in external solution and slowly
perfused (1-2 min for complete solution change) into the recording chamber
after stable control currents were recorded.
RESULTS
Sensitivity of the SgKvi A Channel.
The interaction of scorpion toxins with ion channel receptors is highly
specific to ion channel subtypes (Adams and Olivera, 1994; Eccles et al,
1994; Rogowski et al., 1994). Several scorpion toxins were examined for
their ability to block K“ current in GFL neurons. 250 nM pandinustoxin and
50 nM a-dendrotoxin, known to be potent blockers of voltage-gated K'
current in other receptor types, did not significantly affect K+ current («10%
change in peak l amplitude at +40 mV) in GFL cells. Tityustoxin-Ka,
however, did appreciably block GFL Ig in the nanomolar concentration range.
