block at pH 6.0 (Figure 6). Fractional block values vs. pH were sigmoidal,
similar to a 1:1 binding curve centered at pH 6.0 and scaled to 0.86 in order
to reflect maximum block achieved at this dose. Control experiments were
also performed to assess the effect of pH itself in this range on ly evoked by
test pulses to +40 mV (Figure 7). pH effects in the absence of toxin were
minor and did not greatly alter the peak current (Figure 7A) or activation and
inactivation rates (Figure 7B).
DISCUSSION
300 nM Tityustoxin-Ka, a concentration z6 times greater than its
estimated Kp of 50 nM in GFL neurons, was found to block Kt current in
both GFL neurons and in Sf9 cells expressing the SgkviA channel,
presumably the major component of Kâ€œ current in GFL cells (Rosenthal et al.,
1996, in press). However, this concentration is 2.4 orders of magnitude
greater than that needed to block cloned Kv1.2 channels in B82 fibroblast
cells (Werkman et al., 1993). This difference in sensitivity is typical of the
exquisite specificity of scorpion toxins for their receptors.
The pH dependence of TsTX-Ka block of GFL 1g indicates a pH
sensitivity of those residues in the toxin or in the Kt channel closely involved
in binding. Histidine is the only amino acid capable of buffering in the 5.0 to
8.0 pH range (Lehninger, 1970). The amino acid sequence of TSTX-Ka
(Figure 1) contains no histidine residues, therefore the presence of a histidine
residue in a position in the Kt channel important for toxin binding might
mediate pH dependence of TsTX-Ka block in GFL neurons. Mutagenesis
