during the developing block by TsTX-Ka are scaled to the same peak in
Figure 4 in order to permit comparison of inactivation kinetics. Single
exponential fits of the inactivating phase resulted in the indicated time
constant (t) values. In addition, inactivation of GFL K+ channels was
substantially more complete in TSTX-Ka. Some of this apparent increase in
the degree of completion of inactivation is probably due to small, residual
Ca“ current, even though the experiment in Figure 4 was carried out in the
presence of 0.8 mM CdCl, in the external solution, which blocks most of the
Ca2t current.
TsTX-Ka block in Sf9 cells is similar to that in GFL neurons.
Although maximum block in Sf9 cells expressing only SgkviA
channel CDNA is less than in GFL (45% block vs. 86% in GFL), the kinetics
of TsTX-Ka block is similar, with half block occurring after =2-3 minutes (20
K+ ext., pH 7.2, 18°0) (Figure 5A). Similarly, inactivation was found to be
faster in TsTX-Ka (t= 45 ms vs. 58 ms in control) (Figure 5B), but this effect
was not as strong as in GFL neurons. Degree (i.e. completeness) of
inactivation is not much affected by TSTX-Ka. Since Sf9 cells express only
the SgkviA channel type, the similarity to TSTX-Ka block of GFL L
suggests that its effects are specific to a single channel type in squid GFL
neurons.
Tityustoxin-Ka block of GFL Ig is pH-dependent.
300 nM TSTX-Ka blocked peak Kt current in GFL neurons in a pH¬
dependent manner with 90% block at pH 9.6, 25% block at pH 5.6, and half
