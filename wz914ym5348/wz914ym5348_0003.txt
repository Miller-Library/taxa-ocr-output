also share a common mechanism of block. Several scorpion toxins have
been shown to bind to the extracellular surface of the ion conduction pore
and physically occlude ion flow like a cork in a bottle (Anderson et al., 1988:
Gross et al., 1994; Miller, 1988; Mackinnon and Miller, 1988, 1989:
Giangiacomo et al., 1992). Specific residues in a-subunits of Kvl (Shaker-
like) channels that are important for toxin binding have been localized to the
S5-S6 pore-forming region and, in particular, to those sites flanking the outer
mouth of the pore (Hartmann et al., 1991; Heginbotham et al., 1994; Gross et
al., 1994; Mackinnon and Yellen, 1990; Yellen et al., 1991; Yool and
Schwartz, 1991).
Thus far, no scorpion toxin studies have been reported on the delayed
rectifier K“ channel of the squid giant axon or in the parent cell bodies in the
giant fiber lobe (GFL) of the stellate ganglion. One of the goals of this study
was to identify which scorpion toxins exhibit potent block of K* currents in
squid GFL neurons. Öf those tested, only tityustoxin-Ka (TSTX-Ka)
exhibited significant block of GFL Ig. TSTX-Ka is a 37 amino acid peptide
from the venom of the Brazilian scorpion, Tityus serrulatus, previously shown
to block voltage-gated K“ current in the cloned Kv1.2 channel (Werkman et
al., 1993). Its effects were also tested in Sf9 insect cells expressing only the
SgkviA gene CDNA, recently identified and proposed to underlie the main
component of delayed rectifier K* current in GFL neurons and giant axons
(Rosenthal et al, 1996, in press).
