MATERIALS AND METHODS
Giant Fiber Lobe Neurons.
Cell bodies were dissociated from the posterior tip of the GFL-stellate
ganglion of Loligo opalescens and maintained in primary culture at 16°0 in L¬
15 medium containing supplemental salts to match the composition of sea
water (Gilly et al., 1990). Cells were normally used within one week of
isolation.
Production of Recombinant Baculovirus.
A recombinant baculovirus carrying the SgkV1A CDNA was created
by Brock et al. (1996). Briefly, the coding region of SgkviA, spliced to the 5
and 3' untranslated regions of the Xenopus B-globin gene, was subcloned
into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
Recombinant baculovirus was isolated and purified by standard procedures
(Summers and Smith, 1987). Sf9 cells were cotransfected with the SgkviA
expression vector and linearized, wild-type AcMNPV DNA. Occlusion¬
negative plaques were purified and amplified by two rounds of plaque
purification. Viral stocks were prepared from final supernatants, titered, and
stored at 4°
Maintenance and Infection of Sf9 Cells.
Sf9 cells were maintained as suspension cultures in complete
TNM:FH media (TNM:FH media + 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mgm
streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 5 mg/ml fungizone) at 27°0
