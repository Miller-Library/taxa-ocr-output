residues in a given channel would not necessarily prevent block, since at
least 1 subunit would remain available for toxin binding. It would instead
reduce the probability of toxin binding by reducing the number of available
site
Although other scorpion toxins are characterized as having simple
mechanisms of block (Goldstein et al., 1994), TSTX-Ka exhibits properties of
a more complicated blocking mechanism. TsTX-Ka block in both GFL and
Sf9 preparations is accompanied by faster and more complete inactivation
of the remaining Kâ€œ current. Whether TsTX-Ka is selectively sparing
channels with this type of inactivation or whether, allosteric effects act to
change inactivation properties is unclear. Inactivation properties are
extremely sensitive to the species of amino acid at position 449 in Shaker
(threonine) which in SgkviA is a serine. T449 in Shaker, like F425, is critical
to charybdotoxin and agitoxin-2 binding. Another interesting puzzle is the
slow time course of TsTX-Ka block. Further studies are clearly needed to
confirm and further analyze this effect. Also needed is a study using Shaker
Kt channels which lack the histidine residue at position 425 to confirm that
TsTX-Ka block of this channel, if it occurs at all, is not pH dependent.
