-80 mV to +40 mV. (B) Inactivation is faster in Sf9 cells (t-45 ms ys. 58
ms in control) but not more complete as seen in GFL Ig. Actual current traces
are shown in control solution and in 300 nM TSTX-Ka (scaled by a factor of
1.86 to match peak control current). Kt current was elicited as in (A).
Figure 6 TsTX-Ka block in GFL neurons is pH dependent. The maximum
block attained (30 - 40 min after application) with 300 nM TSTX-Ka at pH
values between 5.6 and 9.6 are shown. At high pH block is maximal; at
low pH block is minimal. A 1:1 binding curve is overlaid, centered at pH 6.0
and scaled by 0.86 to match the maximum block achieved at this dose. The
dotted vertical line indicates the pH at which half of the blockable current is
blocked (pH 6.0). Peak currents in toxin were measured at each pH
following depolarizing 25 ms voltage steps from -80 mV to +40 mV and
expressed as a percentage of control current.
Figure 7 pH effects alone do not account for differential block at varying pH.
(A) Actual current traces from the same cell, elicited by depolarizing voltage
steps (from -80 mV to +40 mV) are shown at pH 5.6, 7.6, and 9.6. Peak
current increases with increasing pH, however the difference between pH 5.6
and pH 7.6 (control) is less than 10%. (B) When peak Kt currents are
scaled to match control, inactivation properties are largely similar at varying
pH.
