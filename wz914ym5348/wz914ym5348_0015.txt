Figure 1 Several families of scorpion toxins share substantial structural
similarity. All 9 toxins listed contain 37 - 39 amino acids. 6 cysteine residues
are located in the same position in each toxin, suggesting a common tertiary
structure. X's are spacers for alignment.
Figure 2 300 nM TSTX-Ka (pH 7.6) produces potent block of Kt current in
GFL neurons. (A) Current activated with depolarizing voltage steps from
-80 mV to +40 mV was reduced 86%. A long 250 ms pulse (left) and a
short 25 ms pulse (right) are shown. (B) 300 nM TSTX-Ka blocked K-
current via a prolonged time course. Following control measurements, TSTX¬
Ka was applied (thick horizontal bar) in external solution perfused into the
recording chamber. Washout was slow and incomplete. Points represent
measurements of peak current elicited by a voltage step to +40 mV.
Figure 3 300 nM TSTX-Ka (pH 7.6) does not markedly affect activation or
deactivation kinetics, or voltage dependence of conduction. (A) A 25 ms
voltage step from -80 mV to +40 mV elicited K“ current in toxin which could
be scaled by a factor of 3.2 to match peak control current (right). The
positive-going slope in toxin is largely unaffected and scales well to match
the slope in control recordings. (B) Tail currents were elicited by a
depolarizing prepulse to +40 mV followed by a test pulse between -130 mV
and -50 mV. A single exponential fit to the resulting current gives time
constants (t) which are largely unchanged in toxin. (C) Conduction-voltage
