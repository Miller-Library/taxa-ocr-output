before dawn when the rocks were still damp, and maintained
in the laboratory under conditions of constant moisture
and dim light. Constant moisture was provided by placing
the snails on wet paper towels. One group of twenty-five
were tested immediately. Figure 3 shows the results of
this study. The increase in the number responding occurs
at a time intermediate between that observed in the
studies shown in Fiures 1 and 2 and suggests a possible
correlation with the diurnal cycle, as well as the tidal
cycle.
In a similar experiment, animals were collected
at lower low wwater after dawn and maintained in the
laboratory under conditions of constant dryness. One-half
of these animals were subjected to the constant light
of the laboratory. The other half were placed in constant
darkness and tested usin only a redlight. The presence
or absence of lighthhad little effect during the period
of the experiment. Figure 4 shows these results. Although
the most striking increases in number responding corresponds
to a point in the tidal cycle correlated with high tide
and approaching darkness, Figures 1, 3, and 4 also
suggest another peak of responsiveness corresponding
to the morning hours.
