response. The following is a study of the relationship
of response time to phases of the tidal and diurnal cycles.
Materials and Methods
All snails were collected from the rocky intertidal
at the Hopkins Marine Station, Mussel Point, California.
Animals were taken from a zone approximately five to six
feet above mean lower low water. No attempt was made to
select animals from either horizontal or vertical surfaces,
but all animals were collected within an area of 2-3
square meters.
Response time was measured by dropping the snails
into approximately 10 milliliters of sea water contained
in 1.5 by 15 cm. test tubes. Care was take to assure
that the animals were placed in the water with their
opercula up. Samples of twenty-five snails were used
and the results expressed as the number of individuals
responding within 60 seconds. Tests with five groups
of twenty-five snails, collected at high tide and at
low tide, gave a standard deviation of 3.85 and 3.42
respectively for the 60 second response time.
Results
Measurements of the number of snails responding
within 60 seconds were mde on groups of snails taken
from the intertidal at times corresponding to points in
the tidal cycle over a period of 51 hours. Figure 1
shows the variation in the number responding in these
