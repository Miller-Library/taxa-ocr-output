Figure 4
Number of L. planaxis responding within 60 seconds.
Animals were collected from the intertidal at lower low
water and maintained in the laboratory under conditions
of constant dryness. One-half of those collected were
kept in constant light, and is represented by the solid
lines and dots. The other half was maintained in constant
darkness and tested using red light. These are represented
by the open circles and the dashed line. Each point
for  both conditions of light shows the number responding
in a sample of twenty-five tested. Vertical bars indicate
plus and minus 1 standard deviation.
