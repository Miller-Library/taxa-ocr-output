Introduction
Persistent diurnal rhythms have been discussed
extensively by many investigaters (Webb, 1950, Behrnes,
1974). Such rhythms have been observed in both physiological
and behavioral processes. (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1961).
Tidal rythms, as well as diurnal rhythms, have been
observed in intertidal invertebrates (see Korringa, 1947).
Sandeen, Stephens and Brown (1956) have noted a
persistent diurnal rhythm of oxygen consumption in two
intertidal gastropods, Littorina littorea and Urosalpinx
cinereus. In Littorina planaxis, two daily periods of
greater oxygen consumption were observed (Lebenzon, Hopkins
Marine Station, Spring report, 1964)
Studies on the general activity of three species
of Littorina, L. scutulata, L.sitkana and L. planaxis
by Behrens (1974) revealed a marked increase in activity
during the hours of darkness. Kops (Hopkins Marine Station,
Spring report, 1964) and Haseman (1911) observed similar
diurnal fluctuations in the activity of L.planaxis and
L. littorea respectively. However, there was no persistence
of these rhythms when the animals were placed under
labortary conditions.
When L. planaxis is suddenly immersed in sea water
by wave action, it responds by opening its operculum,
extending its foot and attatching to the substratum (Bigler,
Hopkins Marine Station, Sprin report, 1964). Preliminary
studies revealed variation in the time required for this
