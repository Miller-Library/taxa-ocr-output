sample groups. The mean number responding during the
period of observation was 10.9. Only the low number
responding at dawn on the first day is significantly
different from the rest, due to the high degree of
variability in the number responding at any one point
in time. However, the fluctuation in the number responding
suggests some correlations with aspects of the tidal and
diurnal cycles. The difference between the number responding
at the peaks of the high tide may be due to a difference
in the violence of the waves at the two times. On day
I, the waves were significantly larger than on day 2.
Figure 2 shows a similar measurement of the number
responding during another relatively calm tidal cycle.
In this study, the high tide has advanced by four hours
and a correla tion between the peak number responding and
the high tide is once again to be noted. Although in
Figure 1 the increase in the number responding occurs
before sunset, this increase occurs well after sunset
in Figure 2 suggesting a closercorrelation between the
tidal cycle, rather than the diurnal cycle.
These field studies suggested a relationship between
the number responding and the amount of available moisture
in the high intertidal where L.planaxis occurs. The rising
tide on relatively calm days provides this area with
nonviolent splash.
To test the relationship between fluctuation in the
number responding and fluctuations in the amount of moisture
available, snails were collected at lower, low water, well
