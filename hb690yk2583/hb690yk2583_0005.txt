Discussion
The responsiveness of samples of snails appears to
vary during the tidal and diurnal cycles. There is a
suggestion from the studies reported here that both of
these cycles may influence this aspect of behavior.
A separation of these effects was attempted by studying
animals maintained under conditions of constant dark or
light and constant dryness or moisture. None of these
treatments caused a markedälteration in the behavior
pattern during the time intervals studied. It appears
that studies of longer duration would be required to
further ellucidate the influence of these two cycles.
However, the number of snails required for these long
term experiments would require the use of animals from
a much greater area than that selected as a source for
these studies. This may introduce an even greater vari¬
ablity in the response of the tested groups.
There is a suggestion of two peak times of greatest
responsiveness. One occuring in the morning anc the other
around sunset. The morning peak was also correlated
with lower low water and the evening peak with higher
high water in these studies. These two peaks correspond
to the times of greatest oxygen consumption, as noted
by Lebenzon (Hopkins Marine Station, Student report,1964).
