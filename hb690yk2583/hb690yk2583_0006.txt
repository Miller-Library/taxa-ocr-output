Summar
1. The number of Littorina planaxis responding
within 60 seconds when immersed in sea water varies
during the tidal and diurnal cycles.
2. Maintainence of animals under conditions of
constant light, dark, dryness or moisture do not appear
to alter the pattern of this variation during periods
of up to 24 hours.
3. Two peak periods of greatest responsiveness
were observed in samples of snails obtained from the
field or maintained as described. One peak period occuned
in the morning and the other around dusk.
