Notice that the level of organic carbon, even in th
undiluted sewage, does not greatly exceed the level
carbon in raw sea water. Figure 1 indicates that the rate
f decomposition is fastest at the beginning of the perio
udied, and the initial decomposition rate becomes greater
as the sewage concentration increases. It is apparent from
the second figure that dichromate-oxidizable organic carbon
appears to be generated during incubation under aeration.
gure 3 compiles the data obtained when adsorption
of organic material to surfaces was controled by incubatin
ml. aliquots of sample in the same test tubes later
used for carbon analysis. Results indicate that falling
carbon levels are attributable to genuine decompositior
not simply adsorption
Changes in BOD with time were observed in sewage
iluted to 1/10 and 1/100. See Figure 4
inally, a study was made of the levels of oxidizable
arbon in sewage drawn from the Monterey facility at the
same hours on three consecutive days. Results appear in
igure 5. Apparently there is no predictable cycle

It is important that under aerobic conditions the
vel of organic carbon detectable by dichromate reductior
is unlikely that organic carbon synthesized
scillates.

Co, fixation can account for this effect because the
riods of oscillation are too short to be explained or
