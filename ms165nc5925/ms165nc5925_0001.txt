FRODUC
t is apparent that the disposaloofssewage i
marine waters must raise the level of oxidizable or
ganic carbon in the water, but the degree to which the
elis raised, the times of maximum input, and the
sistence of the organic carbon have been unclear.
uch matters are of importance for two reasons: 1) Some
the organic carbon introduced by the sewage is in
irticulate form and invites the attachment and prolif
ration of bacteria; 2) if sewage deposits a great exc
organic carbon, there will be an increased demand or
oxygen for its oxidation and an accompanying stress
aerobic organisms. The objectives of this study have
en consonant with the above considerations. Readily
oxidizable organic carbon was measured by its abilit
to reduce dichromate
IATERTALS AND NETHOD
Oxidizable carbon was determined by the col-
imetric method described by Parsons and Strickland (1
