was heated as before for an additional sixty minutes. En
tinctions were measured in a l cm. cell in a Beckman DU
at 440 mu. Oxidizable carbon was determined from a standar
curve constructed by measuring the extinctions of various
glucose concentrations. The linearity of this curve made
the following equation applicable:
grams carbon/3 mls= Ex G, where E is the mean
extinction of triplicate determinations and G is the con
stant for a given oxidant solution. In this series o
xperiments two oxidant solutions were used. For the
first of these, G-260, and for the second, G-310. In
general, G- 10 x glucose concentration which yields ar
extinction of .100. Even samples containing fine particu-
late matter gave results within that limit
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) was determined by
standard methods (2) with only a three hour incubation
eriod before titration.
namics of organic carbon and BOD were studie
as follows. The samples were well-aerated or maintaine-
under anaerobic conditions by bubbling nitrogen gas
at a similar rate. Incubation was at 14 C, the temperature
of ambient sea water
The preparations were sampled at
intervals for the organic carbon or oxygen determinations
