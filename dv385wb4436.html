Proteolytic Enzymes in the Gastropod Tegula funebralis

RELATIVELY LITTLE has been reported on invertebrate
1600-
enzymes. In the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis
(A. ADAMS, 1854), commonly found in the rocky inter¬
tidal zone of the western coast of North America, various
1200-
carbohydrases have recently been reported (GALLI &amp
GIESE, 1959). Although these snails are primarily herbi¬
vorous, one might expect proteases and lipases to be
present in their digestive system. The purpose of this
8 800
study was to find and to characterize the proteases in
T. funebralis.
METHODS

Only fresh animals collected at China Point, Pacific
Grove, California, were used in this experiment. The
enzyme extract was a saline homogenate of the entire
