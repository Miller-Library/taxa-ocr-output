INTRODUCTION
lirolana harfordi is a marine isopod which occurs most
abundantly under rocks in the high intertidal zone from British
Columbia to at least Ensenada (Ricketts and Calvin, 1968).
The animal has also been observed at night actively swimming in
the swirling water of breaking waves (author, personal obser-
vation). Of the relatively small amount of information accumulated
on <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. harfordi</span> very little has been directed toward the ecological
relationships between the animal and its environment.
Investigation of the aspects of feeding and energetics
in C. harfordi has shown, among other things, that although it
will actively seek bait in the form of pieces of fish during
both day and night, activity is higher during the night than
during the day (Johnson, 1973). Although generally considered to
be a scavanger, Johnson feels they are primarily predators upon
marine invertebrates such as small marine annelids. Brooding
females are known to go for months at a time without eating
anything. Ecological work on another cirolanid, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Excirolana chiltoni : Exact'>Excirolana
chiltoni,</span> has demonstrated that activity patterns in this animal
are closely tied to tidal rhythms (Enright, 1965). This species
remains buried in the sand except during a 4- to 6-hour interval
shortly after the tidal crest on the beach of collection, and
the swirling action of the surf (as simulated in lab) initiates
the pattern of activity.
Isopod ecology studies performed at Hopkins Marine Station
in 1973 suggested that within the period of high activity during
nighttime hours there is a sharp peak in activity that has not
been correlated to any obvious environmental factor.
Finally, it has been shown that the benthic intertidal
amphipod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Synchelidium : Exact'>Synchelidium</span> spp. shows bursts of swimming activity in
response to small, short-term changes in hydrostatic pressure
which may be experienced by the animals as waves peak just before
breaking. This may be a mechanism by which the animals maintain
themselves in this zone (Digby, 1961). A similar situation may
exist in C. harfordi.
The purpose of the present investigation was to establish
the activity patterns of C. harfordi and to identify the environ-
mental factors which were most influential upon these patterns.
The factors which were felt to be the most important were light,
depth of water, disturbance of substrate in which the animals
occur, and water temperature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The investigation was divided into two parts. Activity patterns
and the most probable influencing environmental factors were
first measured in the field. The factors which most closely
correlated to activity patterns were then simulated in the lab-
oratory to establish the relative importance of each.
Field study. The level of activity was ascertained by counting
the number of animals caught in baited traps over a given length
of time. 10 traps were spaced at 4-m intervals along a 45-m
transect line running perpendicular to the shoreline. The traps
were numbered from 1 to 10 going from +92 cm to -116 cm tidal
level (see Figure 1). The cotton lines of the traps could be
clipped on the transect line allowing easy removal and replace¬
ment of all traps in a short time period (see Figure 2). The
traps could then be taken into the lab to remove and count the
animals. A trap consisted of a plastic freezer jar 7.5 cm deep
and 9 cm in diameter. 9 holes of 7 mm diameter were drilled
in the bottom which allowed the animals to crawl in. The plastic
screen cone guided them into the trap and prevented their exit.
The cotton lines were used to attach a 1.5-pound diver's weight
to the trap and to attach both the weight and the trap to the
transect line. The transect line consisted of +inch polyethylene
braid anchored at both ends by lag eye-bolts embedded in granite
by expansion sleeves and epoxy. The bait consisted of weighed
pieces of squid wrapped in fine nylon cloth to prevent the
squid from being eaten. The bait was replaced every three
hours. Since preliminary experiments showed essentially no
activity during daylight hours traps were checked every hour
from 1800 to 2400 hours on one night and from 2400 to 0600
hours the following night. As traps were collected depth,
temperature, wave period, and wave height were recorded.
Laboratory study. The behavior of C. harfordi in the laboratory
made it a difficult subject in which to determine patterns of
activity. If placed in a tub of seawater the animals ceaselessly
swam about and showed continuous activity. If running seawater
was placed in the tub the animals oriented toward the current
and eventually crawled up the hose and invaded the seawater system.
The experimental chambers therefore consisted of aquaria with
one rock and 5 cm of sand on the bottom. Each rock was weighed
to insure all aquaria contained a rock of similar size. These
conditions closely matched the natural under-rock habitat of the
animal. Once the animals were introduced into the aquaria
they immediately burrowed into the sand or under the rock and
remained there for indefinite periods of time. If, however,
10 ml of squid-water (one 40-g squid and 400 ml seawater put in
a blender at high speed for 2 minutes, then strained) was added,
within minutes the animals came out of the sand, swam about for
a few minutes, and returned to their hiding place. In each
experiment the response time (e.g., the time interval between
the introduction of the food stimulus and the appearance of the
first animal) was used as the criterion for level of activity:
a lower response time indicated a higher level of activity. In
some experiments 8 minutes was the time limit beyond which no
response was considered to occur. 10 minutes was the time limit
used in later experiments.
While many environmental factors interact to influence
the activity patterns of C. harfordi, laboratory experiments
were restricted to light, depth, and water turbulence.
Experiments to test the affects of light upon activity
patterns were conducted in three aquaria illuminated by three
General Electric F72712 cool-white fluorescent tubes placed 40
cm above the water surface. Each aquarium containing 20 animals
was placed under constant light, constant dark, and light-dark
conditions (lights off from 2000 to 0600 hours in the light-dark
cycle). Response time and water temperature were recorded every
two hours for 24 hours.
Experiments to test the affects of tidal rhythm upon
activity wore conducted in three aquaria, each containing 20
animals, and placed under the three light conditions described
above. In the constant light and the light-dark aquaria the water
level was lowered from the normal 25 cm depth to 3 cm above the
sand from 0400 to 1000 hours during a 48-hour period. In the
constant light aquarium the water level was lowered from 2100 to
0300 hours for a 24-hour period. This duration of low water
simulated the duration of low tide at the time and location from
which the animals were collected. Response time and temperature
were recorded every two hours except for a 4-hour break in the
48-hour experiments.
Experiments to test the affects of water disturbance upon
activity were conducted in three aquaria, each containing 20
animals and placed under the three light regimes previously de-
scribed. Water disturbance was created in the aquaria by a 120-
volt, AC electrio stirrer connected to a timing device allowing
the motor to run for 4 seconds, stop for 9 seconds, and run for
4 seconds repeatedly for six hours, after which six hours of
quiescence followed. This cycle was repeated for 24 hours.
The response time and temperature were recorded every two hours.
In all experiments, the flow rate in the aquaria was ad-
justed to between 1240 ml/min and 1320 ml/min in order to keep
the dilution rate of squid water the same. During times of low
water in the tidal rhythm experiment the squid-water was diluted
by the appropriate amount to account for the reduced volume of
seawater.
Laboratory animals were trapped as previously described.
Males and non-brooding females will satiate themselves if given
a large enough piece of food and will not eat for a week or two
afterward. Presumably they will not respond to a food stimulus
during this time so the traps selected for hungry males and non-
brooding females. This eliminated a potentially large source
of error in response time in the laboratory. Animals were used
no longer than 8 hours after collection. They were allowed
approximately 6 hours to acclimatize to the experimental conditons.
SULTS
Field study. Original data showed that variations in temperature.
wave period and wave height were insufficient to account for
changes in activity, and the patterns in the fluctuations of
these faotors did not correlate with fluotuations in activity
levels, as shown in Figure 3.
The activity pattern of the field population is presented
in Figures 4-6 which present both the number of animals found
as a function of time and the water depth at trap sites 6. 7.
8, and 9, respectively. Due to an unexpectedly low tide on May
28 traps 1-5 were above water throughout the entire 6-hour
period. Consequently data from these traps were not collected.
No more than one animal appeared in trap 10 at any time so the
results were not presented.
Figure 4-a shows that peak activity occured at 0100 hours.
This the is the time at which the water level reached 25 cm.
Figure 5-a shows peak activity again occured at 0100 hours.
Figure 5-b shows the close correlation between time of peak
activity and the time at which the water level reached 25 cm.
Figuro 6-a shows that the activity peak occured at 0200 hours,
an hour later than in any of the othor previous graphs. Figure
6-b shows that water depth reached its shallowest point between
2400 and 0200 hours. Peak activity oocured within this time in-
terval. Figure 7-a shows that a much lower peak occured an hour
later, corresponding to the ebbing tide which was occuring at
this time. The water depth never even approached the 25 cm
depth found in Figures 4, 5, and 6. The corresponding activity
level did not approach the height that it did in Figures 4,
5. and 6. Figure 8 shows that a definite peak in activity occured
at the 20-40 cm depth interval, corresponding to the peaks in
activity found at the time the water level was 25 cm at traps
6 and 7, and corresponding to the lower peaks of activity which
occured at the time minimum depth was reached at traps 8 and 9.
Laboratory study. The results from the experiments testing
the effect of light on activity patterns are represented in
Figures 9-a through 9-c. The response times shown here are aver-
aged response times from three different experiments. A response
time above 9.5 minutes was considered no response since after
8 minutes the response-time determination was ended in one ex-
periment and after 10 minutes it was ended in two other exper-
iments. Activity level was much lower (higher response time)
in constant light than in constant dark. No significance was
ascribed to the fluctuations during the 24-hour test period in
constant conditions. The activity level increased markedly
during the dark period of the light-dark cycle. Some antici-
pation of the change in light conditions was shown.
The results from the experiments testing the affect of
tidal rhythm upon activity level in the three light regimes are
shown in Figures 10 and 11. Response times shown are those ob¬
tained from one experiment. 8 minutes was the time limit within
which a response had to occur in Figure 10, and 10 minutes was
the time limit in Figure 11. In constant dark the activity level
was very much affected by tidal cycle; the level of activity was
lower during time of low water and increased when the level of
water was raised. In the light-dark cycle activity was cued on
the light only, tidal levels notwithstanding.
The results of the experiments testing the affect of water
water disturbance upon activity level in the three light regimes
re shown in Figures 12-a through 12-c. Response times shown
are those obtained from a single experiment. 10 minutes was the
time in which a response had to occur. Figures 12-a and 12-5
show no detectable pattern in activity level. Figure 12-c shows
the typical pattern of response time in the presence of the light-
dark cycle seen in Figures 9-c and Figure 10.
DISCUSSION
It is not surprising that C. harfordi did not appear to
cue its activity pattern to temperature. During cold, foggy
10
days the water in the high intertidal probably does not fluctuate
any more than the ambient sea temperature and would not signal
to the animals that conditions are favorable for high levels of
activity.
The confirmation of the nocturnal habits of C. harfordi
is not unexpected. Birds are known to be heavy predators on
terrestrial isopods. Marine birds, which are likely to show
diurnal activity patterns, may have been an important predator
upon C. harfordi and through evolution have applied heavy selective
pressure for the isopods to adopt a nocturnal lifestyle. Day-
time would also provide heavy physiological stress upon an ani¬
mal venturing out at a low tide under a high noon sun.
The data strongly suggest that the animals have an opt-
imum depth of 20 to 40 cm which raises many interesting questions.
Do they remain in their homes until the water level directly
over their heads reaches 20 to 40 cm, or do they all come out
at sunset and merely follow the tidal cycle up and down main-
taining a position at 20 to 40 cm? It is impossible to tell from
the present data. What are the advantages in maintaining this
optimum depth? Perhaps under selection pressure from deeper
vater predatory fish a behavioral pattern has evolved keeping
isopods from venturing into deep water. At the same time ex¬
cursions into shallower water presents the possibility of being
caught in a high tide pool as the tide was ebbing away.
11
Bofore any dofinite conclusions can be drawn, however,
much more field data must be collected to present a statistically
valid sample size during all phases of the tidal cycle. The
possibilities are nonetheless intriguing.
MIARY
C. harfordi shows definite nocturnal activity patterns.
Of the four environmental factors examined, light and water depth
affect the animals' level of activity. Light is the most important
of the two; only in the absence of this factor does water depth
appear to influence the activity of the animal.
