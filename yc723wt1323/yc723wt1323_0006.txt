Tegula and Benthic Predators
snails after 10 minutes in different water types were analyzed by
Chi-square test.
Predation Rates
To test whether predation rates are different between the 3
Tegula species, snails were fed to predators in the outdoor tanks.
The consumption rates of snails fed to Pisaster and Pycnopodia were
calculated by counting, removing, and replacing empty shells daily.
Snails above the water line were knocked back into the tank.
Consumption rate for snails fed to Cancer was calculated by counting
the live snails remaining in the tank. These were then returned with
additional snails to keep the total number of each Tegula species
constant. Table I contains the specific numbers of organisms used in
each trial. The number of snails of each species eaten per individual
predator per day were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Additional Pycnopodia Experiments
To differentiate between effects of predator preferences and
effectiveness of prey escape responses, anesthesia was used to
eliminate escape responses. Two snails of each species were
submerged in isotonic MgCl2 solution for 90 minutes. They were
then added to an outdoor tank containing a single Pycnopodia.
Empty shells were removed daily. Snails remained inactive for the
duration of the experiment which lasted for 2 days.
