Tegula and Benthic Predators
a similar percentage from each species (Table IV). This shows a lack
of species selection by Cancer. Of the snails that Cancer tried to
consume, a greater percentage of T.pulligo and T.montereyi were
subsequently eaten than T.brunnea (Table IV). These data suggest
that Cancer consume the species with the thinnest and most easily
broken shells, those being T.pulligo and T.montereyi.
Pisaster Experiments
The data from the Pisaster eating trials reveal insignificant
differences between the consumption rates of the different Tegula
species (Figure 10; Table V). The low number of trials makes it
difficult to resolve differences in consumption rates.
DISCUSSION
Responses to Predator Scented Water
The detection of waterborne chemicals by the three Tegula
species varies between species. T.brunnea was able to detect all
three predators based on shell emergence times or movement
patterns. T..pulligo can detect Cancer and Pycnopodia, but not
Pisaster. T.montereyi, in contrast, appears to detect only Pisaster,
and not Cancer and Pycnopodia. Finally, all three Tegula species
seem to distinguish between Cancer and the starfish, but not
between the individual sea stars.
