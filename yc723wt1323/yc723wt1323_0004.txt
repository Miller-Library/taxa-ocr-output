Tegula and Benthic Predators
shelled gastropods and are thought to influence shell evolution in
areas where predation is high (Vermeij, 1978, 1987; Geller, 1982;
Palmer, 1985).
With a variety of simple experiments, this study attempts to
characterize avoidance and escape behaviors of each of the three
Tegula species to Pisaster, Pycnopodia, and Cancer. Additionally,
simple preferences by the predators for a particular Tegula species
based on snail palatability or shell morphology (other than shell
thickness which is examined with other defensive adaptations) will
be explored.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted at the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California. All experimental
organisms were collected by SCUBA divers from the kelp forest
adjacent to the station and stored in outdoor tanks supplied with
running sea water. Organisms were given at least 24 hours to
acclimate to the tanks before use. Pycnopodia were given an
additional 24 hours to allow for the release of stomach contents.
Behavioral observations were made in three fiberglass outdoor
tanks (90 x 90 x 60 cm) and in two glass indoor aquaria (45 x 25 x
30 cm) each supplied with running sea water. All experiments were
carried out using Tegula with a maximum basal diameter of 19 to 28
mm. Pisaster giganteus ranged in sized from 17.5 to 27.2 cm (from
