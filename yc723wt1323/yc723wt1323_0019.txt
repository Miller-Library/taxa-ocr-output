Tegula and Benthic Predators
T.brunnea to lower mortality from predation. Although still
susceptible to Cancer predation, thicker shells are effective in
decreasing the potential food value of the snail by increasing its
handling time. Thick shells, however, are not desirable for all species
because they are expensive to make and may not be as functional
overall as some thinner shell types are (Vermeij, 1978, 1987; Palmer,
1985)
Focusing on the consumption of T.montereyi and T.pulligo, a
surprising finding was that more T.pulligo were consumed than
T.montereyi. T.montereyi have the thinnest shells and theoretically
should have been consumed at the highest rate. T.montereyi is not
distasteful to Cancer, since all extracted individuals were consumed.
One possible explanation for this discrepancy concerns shell
structure. Vermeij (1987) reports that crabs can be discouraged
from peeling a shell as the spirals get smaller and tighter together.
Furthermore, a deep umbilicus can lessen structural weaknesses of
shells. T.montereyi have the best defined umbilicals of the three
Tegula species which might account for its lower than expected
consumption rate. Additional research into this area would be of
value.
Pisaster Experiments
Pisaster consumed a higher number of T.brunnea and T.pulligo
than of T.montereyi over both feeding studies. No experiments were
conducted to identify possible defensive behaviors by T.montereyi
because the data were statistically insignificant. Previous studies,
