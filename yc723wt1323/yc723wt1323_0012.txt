Tegula and Benthic Predators
Turning to the role of Tegula escape responses in surviving
Pycnopodia predation, snails were anesthetized and fed to the star.
Within 2 days, all snails were consumed in apparently random order
indicating the presence of escape behaviors in live T.montereyi and
T.pulligo.
The possibility of a mucus secretion by T.montereyi and
T.pulligo to deter predation was examined by extracting snails that
had been exposed to Pycnopodia tube feet and feeding the snails to
Pycnopodia. In both trials involving stimulated T.montereyi and
T.pulligo, all snails were eaten regardless of species, suggesting that a
mucus coating is not effective with dead snails.
Finally, pedal mucus secretion was studied by exposing
T.montereyi or T.pulligo to Pycnopodia and rubbing their mucus film
over the foot and shell of a T.brunnea. Of the 3 T.pulligo experiments
where Pycnopodia responded in less than 2 minutes, 2 trials resulted
in Pycnopodia consuming the untreated T.brunnea while actively
avoiding the one treated with mucus from T.pulligo. Both T.brunnea
were consumed in the third trial. Of the 3 T.montereyi experiments
where Pycnopodia responded in less than 2 minutes, 2 trials resulted
in Pycnopodia consuming the untreated T.brunnea and rejecting the
one treated with mucus from stimulated T.montereyi. The second of
these 2 trials included the T.brunnea treated with mucus from the
unstimulated T.montereyi, and it too was eaten. Both T.brunnea
were consumed in the third trial. In 4 control trials using 2
untreated T.brunnea, both snails were consumed by Pycnopodia.
