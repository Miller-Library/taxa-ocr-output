Tegula and Benthic Predators
Secretion of pedal mucus by live snails was tested by holding a
T.pulligo against the tube feet of Pycnopodia for approximately 2
minutes. The foot of the stimulated snail was then rubbed over the
shell and foot of a T.brunnea. This T.brunnea was added along with
an untreated T.brunnea to an indoor tank containing a single
Pycnopodia. Feeding behavior was only recorded if Pycnopodia
actively investigated the snails within two minutes of their deposit
into the tank and if at least 1 snail was consumed. Otherwise, the
trial was discarded to avoid artifacts resulting from loss or dilution of
the applied coating of mucus or from snail rejection due to a
nonforaging Pycnopodia. Three successful trials were carried out
with stimulation of T.pulligo, and 4 with T.montereyi. In 1 trial
involving T.montereyi, a third T.brunnea was treated with the mucus
from an unstimulated T.montereyi and added to the tank. Control
trials were conducted by feeding Pycnopodia 2 untreated T.brunnea.
Additional Cancer Experiments
To investigate movement as a possible escape response, 15
snails of each species were added to an outdoor tank containing 1
week-old crab water. After 100 minutes, the snails' location on the
sides or bottom of the tank was recorded. This test was repeated
once.
The response of Cancer to anesthetized snails was also
examined. One test included 3 crabs and 15 snails per species over 1
day. This test was repeated using only 2 crabs. A third trial
involved 5 snails per species and 1 crab.
