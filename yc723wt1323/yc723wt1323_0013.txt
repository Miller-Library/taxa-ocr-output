Tegula and Benthic Predators
Cancer Experiments
The consumption data shows that Cancer ate T.pulligo
significantly more often than T.brunnea. T.montereyi was eaten
more frequently than T.brunnea, but these differences were not
statistically significant (Fig. 8; Table III). In the presence of MgClz,
all snails regardless of species were eaten at a significantly higher
rate. The rank order of the individual species, however, did not
change (Fig. 8; Table III). This indicates that behavioral responses
by Tegula species reduce predation by crabs, but that the
effectiveness is similar for all 3 species
Site selection by snails as a possible escape response was
investigated by recording the location of Tegula in the tank
containing Cancer water. The average of both 100-minute trials
reveals that the number of snails on the bottom and walls of the tank
is similar among the 3 Tegula species (Fig. 9). More snails were
found on the walls, away from where the crabs would be, than were
located on the bottom of the tank.
The selection of certain Tegula species based on Cancer
preference was studied by feeding extracted snails to the crabs.
In
both trials, all 6 snails, 2 of each species, were eaten within 10
minutes in no order. Cancer apparently do not select between
species based on snail palatability
To investigate further how Cancer selects its prey, feeding
behavior was observed and analyzed. Of the number of snails of
each species picked up by Cancer, the crabs attempted to consume
(either brought snail to mouth or tried to crack shell with chelipeds)
