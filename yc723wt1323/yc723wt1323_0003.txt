Tegula and Benthic Predators
increases (Legault and Himmelman, 1993). This paper explores the
variety of defensive adaptations of three species of subtidal Tegula
to three common benthic predators.
Three species of Tegula live on and around the kelp forests off
the central Californian coast. All are similar in size, diet, and external
shell morphology, but differ in abundance, distribution, and shell
strength (Abbott and Haderlie, 1980; Watanabe, 1983; Watanabe,
1984). T.brunnea, the most abundant snail, resides in low intertidal
and subtidal waters (0-6m), and has the thickest shell. T.montereyi,
rarest of the three species, inhabits off-shore kelp beds (7-12m) with
a majority of adults living on the lower half of kelp plants.
T.montereyi has the thinnest shell of the three species. T.pulligo has
a density close to that of T.brunnea, and is found in off-shore kelp
beds with T.montereyi. The shell thickness of T.pulligo is between
that of T.brunnea and T.montereyi.
Most known Tegula predators are benthic, the principal ones
being Pisaster giganteus and Pycnopodia helianthoides (Watanabe,
1984). Cancer antennarius also feed on Tegula, but less frequently
than do the starfishes. Pisaster is found in low intertidal areas, but is
most common in subtidal zones (Feder, 1980). Many gastropod
species respond to Pisaster by increasing locomotion away from the
sea star and increasing climbing rates (Szal, 1970; Schmitt, 1981,
1982; Harrold, 1982; Watanabe, 1983). Pycnopodia is less abundant
than Pisaster and occurs in subtidal zones. Cancer has a density
between that of Pisaster and Pycnopodia, and is generally found in
the intertidal zone and subtidally near the bases of kelp (Garth and
Abbott, 1980). Crushing predators generally prey upon thinner
