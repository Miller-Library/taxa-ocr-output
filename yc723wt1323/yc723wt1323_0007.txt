Tegula and Benthic Predators
Predation of Tegula by Pycnopodia based on each species
palatability was investigated by feeding Pycnopodia extracted snails
The shells of six Tegula, two of each species, were opened, and the
foot and head of the snails removed. All six snails were placed in an
indoor aquarium containing a single Pycnopodia and feeding
behavior was observed.
The preference of Pycnopodia for Tegula species based on shell
characteristics was investigated by extracting one Tegula of each
species. The soft parts of each snail were then inserted into a shell of
a different Tegula species. T.brunnea was inserted into a shell of
T.montereyi, T.montereyi inserted into a shell of T.pulligo, and
T.pulligo was inserted into a shell of T.brunnea. The snails were
inserted so that the operculum blocked the shell aperture leaving no
snail tissue exposed. The shells were then placed in an indoor
aquarium containing a single Pycnopodia, and feeding behavior was
observed.
Finally, experiments were conducted to determine whether T.
montereyi and T. pulligo secrete a pedal mucus that is distasteful to
Pycnopodia. T.montereyi was held against the tube feet of
Pycnopodia for approximately 2 minutes, and then extracted from its
shell. The T.montereyi was then added together with an extracted
T.brunnea and T.pulligo, neither of which had been stimulated by a
predator, to an indoor aquarium holding a different Pycnopodia than
was used to stimulate the snail. Feeding behavior was observed.
This study was repeated, but with the stimulation of a T.pulligo
instead of a T.montereyi.
