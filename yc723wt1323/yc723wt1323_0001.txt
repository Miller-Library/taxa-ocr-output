Tegula and Benthic Predators
ABSTRACT
This study investigates the chemoreceptive abilities and escape
responses of Tegula brunnea, T.montereyi, and T.pulligo to common
predators. The predators studied were the sea stars Pisaster
giganteus and Pycnopodia helianthoides, and the crab Cancer
antennarius. T.brunnea and T.pulligo could both detect Cancer from
waterborne olfactory cues. Furthermore, all three Tegula species
took a significantly longer time to emerge from their shells in Cancer
water as opposed to Pisaster or Pycnopodia water. T.brunnea
exhibited a flight response in the starfish waters but not in Cancer
water. T.pulligo exhibited a flight response to Pycnopodia, but not to
Pisaster or Cancer. T.montereyi displayed a flight response in
Pisaster water but was more stationary in Pycnopodia and Cancer
waters.
In the lab, T.brunnea was most susceptible to predation by
Pycnopodia. T.pulligo and T.montereyi, however, secreted a
distasteful pedal mucus that significantly decreased successful
predation by Pycnopodia. T.brunnea did not have such a defensive
mechanism.
None of the Tegula species displayed an active escape response
to the presence of Cancer. T.brunnea, however, was consumed least
often by Cancer because it had the thickest shell of the Tegula
species. T.pulligo, with an intermediate shell thickness, was
consumed at the greatest rate. T.montereyi, the thinnest shelled
species, had a lower than expected consumption rate, possibly
because of structural characteristics of its shell other than thickness.
