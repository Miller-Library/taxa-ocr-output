Tegula and Benthic Predators
moving predators (Watanabe, 1984). This then puts the snail in a
position where dropping off the substratum would give it a chance to
fall out of the reach of nearby predators (Watanabe, 1983). The lack
of active climbing by T.pulligo in response to Pisaster water cannot
be explained and further research would be of interest.
T.montereyi uses two different avoidance responses to Pisaster
and Pycnopodia water. Similar findings were reported by Herrlinger
(1983) and Watanabe (1983). In Pisaster water, significantly more
snails were found on the sides of the dish as compared to the control
water. In Pycnopodia water, however, T.montereyi did not show
differences in movement compared to the control water. This lack of
detection does not seem critical for survival since T.montereyi can
escape predation with a mucus secretion upon contact by
Pycnopodia, as will be discussed later.
Pycnopodia Experiments
T.pulligo and T.montereyi exhibited nearly flawless escape
responses to Pycnopodia predation in the laboratory. In contrast,
T.brunnea did not possess a defensive adaptation to survive
Pycnopodia. In the absence of escape behaviors, Pycnopodia did not
show a preference for one snail species over another. All dead snails,
regardless of species, were consumed. This indicates that the
different mortality rates between the Tegula species are indeed due
to the presence or absence of escape responses.
T.brunnea, whenever captured by a foraging sea star, was
consumed. The only exception was when its shell and foot was
