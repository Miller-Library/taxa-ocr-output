Tegula and Benthic Predators
Taste preferences of Cancer were studied by feeding two
extracted snails of each species to a single crab in the indoor
aquarium. This test was repeated in the outdoor tank.
Finally, general observations of Cancer feeding on live snails
were made in the indoor tanks using one crab and 5 snails of each
species. Approximately 90 percent of the tank was covered in brown
butcher paper to limit visual distractions, and most observations
were made after dark using minimal lighting. Observations focused
on species selection, time held for each snail, and the condition of the
snail after release by the crab.
RESULTS
Responses to Predator Scented Water
Exposing Tegula to water with various predator scents elicits
specific avoidance responses from all 3 Tegula species. For both
T.brunnea and T.pulligo, the shell emergence times were significantly
greater in Cancer water compared to the control water and both
starfish species. Shell emergence times in starfish water were
shorter than in the control water, but these differences were not
significant for either snail species (Figs. 1-2; Table II). T.brunnea
and T.pulligo appear to detect Cancer water but not Pisaster or
Pycnopodia.
T. montereyi shell emergence time in control water was
significantly longer than that for either T.brunnea or T.pulligo
