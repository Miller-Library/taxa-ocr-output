Tegula and Benthic Predators
In response to Pisaster predation, fewer T.montereyi were
consumed than either T.pulligo or T.brunnea. These differences were
not significant and were not pursued further.
INTRODUCTION
Predation in natural habitats plays an important role in
structuring marine communities. Predation can determine the
abundance, variability, and distribution of species as well as provide
prey with strong selective pressures for the evolution of defensive
mechanisms that reduce predator-induced mortality. Prosobranch
gastropods have been particularly well-studied in this regard (Geller,
1982; Harrold, 1982; Schmitt, 1982; Shivji et al., 1983; Watanabe.
1984). These mechanisms can be classified as either avoidance
responses or general defense mechanisms.
Avoidance responses serve to limit encounters with predators.
These include camouflage coloration, lengthy withdrawal into shell,
or increased locomotion or climbing upon olfactory stimulation by
waterborne chemicals (Burke, 1964; Schmitt, 1981; Geller, 1982;
Palmer et al., 1982). The role of general defense mechanisms is to
reduce the probability of death once contact with a predator is made.
Common examples are morphologies that increase the prey's
handling time or chemicals to confuse the predator or render the
prey unpalatable (Barns, 1972; Herrlinger, 1983; Watanabe, 1983;
Palmer, 1985; Legault and Himmelman, 1993;). The intensity of
these responses has been shown to increase as the risk of predation
