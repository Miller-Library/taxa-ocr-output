Tegula and Benthic Predators
species in my laboratory experiments. In my tests, therefore,
Pycnopodia, preyed upon the least well defended species, T.brunnea,
and was not forced to attempt consumption of the other two species
as may have been the case in Watanabeâ€™s (1983) experiments.
Unlike with the experiments by Shivji, et al. (1983) and
Watanabe (1983), the differences between my results and those of
Herrlinger (1983) cannot readily be accounted. Herrlinger (1983)
observed organisms in the same area from which my animals were
obtained. He found that Pycnopodia ate a much greater percentage
of T.pulligo than of either T.brunnea or T.montereyi, which were
hardly consumed at all. One explanation as to why more T.pulligo
are consumed in the field than T.brunnea is that T.pulligo are simply
more accessible to predation than are T.brunnea. T.pulligo survive in
subtidal kelp zones, but T.brunnea are mainly found in shallower
areas with a highly protective algal cover (Herrlinger, 1983;
Watanabe, 1984). This might make T.brunnea less accessible to
Pycnopodia forcing Pycnopodia to prey upon the more available
T.pulligo.
Cancer Experiments
T.brunnea had the most effective defense of the three Tegula
species against Cancer predation. In the absence of all active escape
responses, Cancer still consumed similar proportions of each Tegula
species. This indicates that the three snail species did not employ
active defensive behaviors that were different from one another.
Instead, a passive response, shell thickness, was effectively used by
