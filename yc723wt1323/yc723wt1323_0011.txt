Tegula and Benthic Predators
there were differences between the Cancer and starfish waters.
Movement patterns were only affected by Pisaster.
Unbiased between-species comparisons of movement patterns
among the 3 Tegula species are not possible since the time before the
opening of the operculum was significantly longer for T.montereyi
than for either T.brunnea or T.pulligo (Appendix A & B). This left
T.montereyi less time than the other 2 species had to migrate to its
final preferred location before the end of the 10-minute experiment.
Pycnopodia Experiments
Of the 35 snails consumed by Pycnopodia during both
consumption trials, all but 2 were T.brunnea. Two T.pulligo and no
T.montereyi were consumed (Figure 7). Since snails above the water
line were knocked back into the tank, all species were assumed to be
equally available to the predators.
Investigating whether taste preference caused T.brunnea to be
consumed at the highest rate, snails of each species were extracted
from their shells and fed to Pycnopodia. In both trials, all snails,
regardless of species, were consumed within 5 minutes, suggesting
that Tegula palatability does not cause Pycnopodia to distinguish and
select between species.
The effect of shell type on consumption by Pycnopodia was
examined by extracting snails and inserting them into shells of
different Tegula species. Again, all snails were consumed, regardless
of species. This indicates that Pycnopodia do not distinguish among
snail species based solely on shell characteristics.
