Tegula and Benthic Predators
(Pc.002), resulting in no significant difference between the
emergence times in the predator waters compared to the control
water for T.montereyi. However, shell emergence times in Cancer
water were still significantly longer than in either sea star water (Fig.
3; Table II)
Another measurement of avoidance response is characterized
by the snailsâ€™ movement in each of the water types. A significantly
greater number of both T.brunnea and T.pulligo climbed the side of
the glass dish in Pycnopodia water compared to the control water
(Figs. 4-5). A significantly greater number of T.brunnea also climbed
in Pisaster water compared to the control. T.pulligo did not show this
trend. Finally, neither T.brunnea or T.pulligo exhibited a significant
climbing difference in Cancer water compared to the control water
(Figs. 4-5).
Significantly more T.montereyi climbed in response to Pisaster
water compared to the control water. The differences between
Pycnopodia water and the control, and Cancer water and the control,
however, were not significant (Fig. 6).
In summary, T.brunnea has a longer shell emergence time in
Cancer water compared to the control, but the movement patterns
are not different. Emergence times were not affected in Pisaster and
Pycnopodia water, but increased climbing in these waters was
observed. T.pulligo is identical to T.brunnea, except that movement
was affected by Pycnopodia and not by Pisaster. T.montereyi's
response is less clear than the other Tegula species due in part to the
longer shell emergence time in the control water. No differences
between the control and predator waters were observed although
