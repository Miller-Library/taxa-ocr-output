Tegula and Benthic Predators
That all three Tegula species take a significantly longer time to
emerge from their shells in Cancer water as opposed to Pisaster or
Pycnopodia water suggests that lengthy withdrawal into the shell is a
defensive behavior to Cancer. Lack of movement and exposure
might increase the chances of the shell appearing empty and being
bypassed by a foraging crab. This is supported by Vermeij (1987)
who reports that withdrawal into the shell helps snails avoid
detection by enemies and thwarts those attacking by way of the
aperture because soft parts cannot be easily reached. Additional
research into this behavior would be of value.
The number of each species of snails on the sides of the dish
does not increase in Cancer water compared to the control water.
This lack of active climbing supports the finding that gastropods are
unable to successfully flee from fast moving predators such as
Cancer, and therefore do not develop flight behaviors from them
(Schmitt, 1981).
The avoidance behaviors of individual Tegula species to
Pisaster and Pycnopodia water vary more than they did in Cancer
water. T.brunnea employs a flight response to Pisaster and
Pycnopodia as indicated by the increased climbing in these waters.
However, its high consumption rate by Pycnopodia in the laboratory
suggests this is not an especially effective response. T.pulligo
exhibits a flight response in Pycnopodia water, but not in Pisaster
water. With the exception of the lack of climbing by T.pulligo in
Pisaster water, these flight behaviors were expected because of the
slower movement speeds of the starfish. In the field, climbing gives
the snails a chance to gain safe refuge in kelp plants from slower
