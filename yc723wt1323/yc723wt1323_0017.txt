Tegula and Benthic Predators
coated with mucus from a T.montereyi or T.pulligo that had been
stimulated by Pycnopodia. Stimulation was necessary for secretion
of the distasteful mucus as evidenced by the consumption of
T.brunnea coated with mucus from an unstimulated T.montereyi.
This supports the assertion that mucus secreted by T.montereyi and
T.pulligo in response to Pycnopodia is accountable for the snails
lower mortality rates (Watanabe, 1983; Herrlinger, 1983).
That T.montereyi survived Pycnopodia predation was not
surprising based on observations by Watanabe (1983). He reports
that T.montereyi allows its head and foot to contact the tube feet of
Pycnopodia when captured. This induces the starfish to reject the
snail as it did in my experiment. Herrlinger (1983) also observed
that Pycnopodia rejects T.montereyi when the snail is brought to the
mouth of Pycnopodia.
The use of distasteful mucus by T.pulligo to escape Pycnopodia,
however, has not been well documented. Herrlinger (1983) reported
that T.pulligo might secrete a distasteful mucus to lower consumption
rates by Pycnopodia. This behavior, though, was not investigated
further. In fact, previous field and laboratory observations of
interactions between T.pulligo and Pycnopodia indicate that T.pulligo
accounts for a major portion of Pycnopodiaâ€™s diet (Herrlinger, 1983:
Shivji et al., 1983; Watanabe, 1983). The different results of Shivji,
et al. (1983) can possibly be accounted for by the fact that their
observations took place off the coast of Vancouver where T.brunnea
is absent. Therefore, T.pulligo may have been the best prey species
available. The contradiction with Watanabe (1983) maybe a
consequence of maintaining constant abundances of each snail
