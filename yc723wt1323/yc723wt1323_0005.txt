Tegula and Benthic Predators

cm, and Cancer antennarius from 15.2 to 15.9 cm (carapace width).
Responses to Predator Scented Water
To examine whether Tegula can detect and differentiate among
predator species by detecting waterborne olfactory cues, snails were
observed in a 350 ml glass dish containing 175 ml of sea water from
various sources. Control sea water was obtained from the running
sea water system, and predator water was taken from tanks which
had held several individual predators for at least 72 hours. A total
of 10 snails of each species were observed in the 4 water types:
control, Pisaster, Cancer, and Pycnopodia water.
To begin, a single snail that had been gently handled until the
operculum fully closed was placed operculum side down in the
center of the dish. Only snails closing the operculum in less than 10
seconds were used in the experiment. These snails were then
observed for 10 minutes, noting the times when the epipodial
tentacles first appeared and when the snail had fully emerged and
attached its foot to the glass. Attachment was confirmed by
observing snails from below. The time between the appearance of
the epipodial tentacles and the sticking of the foot to the dish will be
referred to as the "shell emergence time." The location of each snail
was recorded after 10 minutes as being above the water line, at the
water line, or on the bottom of the dish. The shell emergence times
were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The location of the
