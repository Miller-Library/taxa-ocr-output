Figure 1.
An enzymatically isolated solitary squid photoreceptor which has shortened to a length of
approximately 100 um. The cell body can be seen as a rounded region with a short section of axon
below it and a long, rod-shaped distal segment above it. The microvillar region, located at the
apical end of the distal segment, is seen as a less clearly defined region of the cell membrane.
Figure 2.
Rounded up photoreceptor cells. The length of the longest cell shown is approximately 40 um.
One dumbbell-shaped cell is visible (upper right corner) with two spherical regions at either end of
the cell connected by a short region of distal segment.
Figure 3.
A cluster of partially shortened photoreceptor cells. Cells are attached below the cell body region.
Figure 4.
Cyclic GMP increases channel openings in inside-out membrane patches. A. Current record
extracted from a continuous recording immediately after patch has been ripped off into an
extracellular solution of Ca2--free ASW: (mM) 460 NaCl, 10 KCl, 60 MgCl,, 10 HEPES (pH
7.8). Pipette contained Ca2+free ASW also. Pipette voltage clamped to-20 mV. None or few
channel openings. B. Current record extracted from a continuous recording from the same patch
as in A after inside membrane face exposed to 10 uM cGMP. Pipette voltage remained clamped to
-20 mV. Multichannel openings shown as downward deflections. Filtered with an 8-pole bessel
filter with 1 kHz cutoff frequency.
