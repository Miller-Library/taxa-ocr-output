Figure 5.
Increase in patch open probability with increasing cGMP concentrations applied to inside face of
the same inside-out patch. Both sides of patch were exposed to the same Ca2+-Free ASW: (mM)
460 Nacl, 10 KCI, 60 MgCh, 10 HEPES (pH 7.8). Patch open probability calculated using 50%
of the smallest unitary conductance measured directly from current recordings as open criterion.
Figure 6.
Patch open probability shows no significant voltage dependence. Both sides of patch were exposed
to the same Ca2+-Free ASW: (mM) 460 NaCl, 10 KCl, 60 MgCl,, 10 HEPES (pH 7.8).
Saturating cGMP concentrations applied to the inner membrane face. Data compiled from several
different patches. Least squares linear regression fit performed (Microsoft Excel).
Figure 7.
Unitary conductance analysis indicating 19 pS non-cGMP-gated channel and 14 pS cGMP-gated
channel. Scatter plots of conductance against conductance reveal clusters of points around channel
conductances. Both sides of membrane exposed to same Ca2-Free ASW: (mM) 460 NaCl, 10
KCl, 60 MgCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.8). Voltage across the patch was 40 mV, pipette negative. A.
Points clustered around 19 pS in the absence of cGMP. B. Same patch with 10 uM CGMP added
to the inner membrane face has a second cluster of points appear at approximately 14 pS.
Figure 8.
Up to four 65 pS channels opening at the same time in a patch with divalent free Nat saline on
both sides: (mM) 520 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.8) and 200 uM cGMP on the inner face.
Pipette clamped to -46 mV. Multiple sweeps are superimposed. Each additional channel opening
increases current by an integer amount of approximately 3 pA. Number of channels open is
indicated (arrows). Filter cut-off frequency was 1 kHz.
