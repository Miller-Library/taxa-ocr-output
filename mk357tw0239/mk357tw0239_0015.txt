Figure 9.
Ca2t block of a 100 pS channel. Divalent free Nat saline on both sides of patch: (mM) 520 NaCl,
10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.8), saturating cGMP applied to inner membrane face. Membrane
voltage was 40 mV, pipette positive. A. Long openings and short closures occurred in the
absence of Ca2t. Dotted line is zero current level. Filter cut-off frequency was 1 kHz. B. All
openings blocked when 2 mM CaCl, solution in Nat saline was added to inner membrane face. C.
Patch conductance decreased with the addition of 2 mM CaCl, to inside face of patch as evidenced
by flatter slope in the presence of calcium. Voltage is varied in a ramp from -50 mV to +50 mV.
