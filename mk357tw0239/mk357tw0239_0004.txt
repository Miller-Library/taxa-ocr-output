containing (mM) 520 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.8). Recordings from macroscopic
patches were made using an Axopatch 200A amplifier. Data analysis was done using PCLAMP
(Axon Instr.) and DEmpsTER software. Records were filtered before digitization using a 8-pole
bessel filter (Frequency Devices).
RESULTS
Morphological characteristics of solitary cells
Intact, solitary photoreceptor cells and cell clusters were obtained in high yield.
Immediately after dissociation, the cells were long (up to 400 um) and rod-shaped, with the cell
body, axon, and distal segment clearly visible as described in Nasi and Gomez (1992). Microvilli
were visible at the end of the distal segment with DIC optics. Within 15-30 min after dissociation,
the cells began to shorten while retaining a rod-shaped morphology (Fig. 1) or rounded up (Fig.
2). The change in morphology was not prevented if the cells were kept on ice. Commonly, the
cells were observed to shorten from both ends, resulting in a dumbbell-shaped cell with spheres
forming from the axon/cell body region and the distal segment (Fig. 2). Good recordings were
obtained from the cells and cell clusters (Fig. 3) up to three hours after dissociation. The addition
of divalent free Nat saline solution to the extracellular medium was observed to speed cell
shortening.
Cyclic GMP increases open probability of inside-out patches
The existence of a cGMP-gated channel was detected in macroscopic inside-out patches
obtained from the cell body region of photoreceptor cells. Brief examination of each patch while
still cell-attached showed that all patches contained some voltage stimulated channel activity
Recordings were performed with Ca2-free ASW on both sides of the membrane. It was
observed that channel openings in some patches were greatly increased upon the addition of cGMP
to the inner membrane face. In the example in Figure 4, the voltage across the patch was 20 mV,
