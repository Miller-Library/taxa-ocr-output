mRNA related to GFLNI mRNA may be expressed in mantle muscle cells.
Localization of labeling to one of the two zones of identified circular muscle
fiber types of mantle muscle (Bone et al, 1981) was not noted, however,
and only diffuse labeling by either antisense probe in all portions of tissue
could be seen. This may be due to poor resolution in the detection of 32P
signal using emulsion coating of the slides. Additional in situ
hybridizations of mantle muscle employing a higher resolution technique
may be necessary to detect localization of probe within mantle muscle
tissue. As with optic lobe, the abundance of Na channel mRNA in mantle
muscle tissue is probably very low, and lengthy exposures are most likely
required in order to detect the presence of Na channel mRNA in mantle
muscle tissue using the RNase protection assay.
