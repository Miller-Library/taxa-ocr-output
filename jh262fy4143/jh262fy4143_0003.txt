protection assays to test for the presence of GFLNI-related Na channels
mRNAs in the stellate ganglion sincluding giant fiber lobe (GFL)I, optic lobe
and mantle muscle of L. opalescens. The results of these experiments
indicate the existence of additional Na channels with partial sequence
homology to GFLNI in the stellate ganglion and optic lobe of L. opalescens.
and provide additional evidence for the presence of a similar type of Na
channel mRNA in mantle muscle cells in this particular species of squid.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of RNA probes. CDNA encoding peptides 484-576 of the
second half of interdomain I-Il of GFLNI was released from pNCSETIO (a
vector created by Josh Rosenthal in our laboratory for fusion protein
generation in the development of Na channel antibodies) with Hind III and
Eco RI. This CDNA was then ligated into Bluescript II KS- phagemid
(double digested with Hind III and Eco RI) to create pHMSI. pNZSÂ¬
(encoding the 3'end of GFLNI mRNA; see Fig. 1A) and pNC5' (encoding the
5'end of GFLNI mRNA; see Fig. 1A) have been described previously
(Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993). 358-labeled antisense HMSI (containing 282 nt
coding and 69 nt vector sequence), antisense NZ5- (containing 135 nt
coding, 102 nt untranslated and 30 nt vector sequence) and sense NCS
(containing 161 nt untranslated and 143 nt vector sequence) RNA probes
for in situ hybridizations were obtained from pHMSI, pNZS- and pNCS
respectively. Each was transcribed (after linearization with the
appropriate restriction enzymes; see Fig. 1A) with T7 RNA polymerase in
the presence of 100 uCi of 13581 UTP by use of a kit (Riboprobe system;
Promega). 32P labeled HMSI and NZ5- probes for RNase protection assay
