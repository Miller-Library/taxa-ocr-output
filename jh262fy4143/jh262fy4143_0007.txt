granular layer, but also reliably labeled cells in the outer granular laver
and in the medulla (Fig. 3D-E). Thus, HMSI appears to label more cell
types than does NZ5- in the optic lobe as well as in the stellate ganglion.
In transverse sections of mantle muscle, labeling above background
of the glass slide was not observed with sense NC5' (Fig. 44). In contrast.
both NZ5- and HMSI exhibited labeling in the tissue sections above this
background level, although labeling appeared to be evenly distributed and
was not localized to any specific regions of the tissue (Fig. 4B-C).
RNase Protection Assay. RNase protection assays were performed in
which HMSI probe was hybridized with stellate ganglion (including GFL)
optic lobe, gill, or mantle muscle RNA, and with control tRNA, and then
digested with RNase. Both tRNA and gill (which is known to lack Na
channels) RNA served as negative controls; a band was not noted for either
of these. Three bands were observed for stellate ganglion; these included
an apparently fully protected band of 282 nt, and two partially protected
bands estimated to be 255 nt and 210 nt (Fig. 5). Bands were not noted
for either optic lobe or mantle muscles (even after additional 3 day
exposure; data not shown)
These hybridization results suggest that, in addition to an mRNA with
complete sequence identity to GFLNI mRNA in the second half of
interdomain I-Il (indicated by the fully protected band), at least one
additional mRNA species is expressed in the stellate ganglion that is highly
homologous (but not identical) to GFLNI.
