ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
1 would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Gilly for his
encouragement and guidance in focusing my ideas in my project
throughout the entire quarter. I owe an especially big thank you to Taylor
Liu for unselfishly devoting numerous hours helping me step by step
through techniques and for always providing great company and being an
invaluable source of advice. I am greatly indebted to Marie Perri for also
giving up much of her time helping me with the RNase protection assays
and for her cheerful companionship in the lab. I would like to thank Matt
McFarlane and Josh Rosenthal for their great senses of humor and always
ready willingness to help me out. Lastly, I would like to thank Simone,
Tony, Zora, Adam and Don for helping make my experience in the Gilly lab
Ã  fun and memorable one.
