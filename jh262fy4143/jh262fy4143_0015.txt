Figure 4. All photos are taken at 40X magnification. A. 4-month-old
mantle muscle section (transverse) hybridized with NC5' sense
probe. Labeling is not observed above the background labeling of
the glass slide. B. 4-month-old mantle muscle section (transverse
hybridized with NZ5- antisense probe. Diffuse labeling in the tissue
is notable above background labeling. C. 4-month-old mantle
muscle section (transverse) hybridized with HMSI antisense probe.
Diffuse labeling in the tissue above background levels is apparent.
Figure 5. Results from RNase protection assays on extracted RNAs using
52P-labeled HMSI probe (overnight exposure). Samples run include
undigested HMSI probe (A), undigested NZ5- probe (B), negative
control tRNA (C), stellate ganglion RNA (D), mantle muscle RNA (E)
optic lobe RNA (F), and negative control gill RNA. Bands are noted
only for undigested HMSI probe, undigested NZ5- probe, and for
stellate ganglion RNA. The three bands corresponding to stellate
ganglion consist of a presumably fully protected band (282 nt) and
two partially protected bands (approximately 255 nt and 210 nt).
The lower mobility of the fully protected band relative to the
undigested HMSI probe is due to removal of 69 nt of vector
sequence in the probe.
