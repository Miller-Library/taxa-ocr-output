RNA extraction. Stellate ganglion (including GFL), optic lobe, mantle
muscle and gill tissues were dissected from live adult squid (collected from
Monterey Bay) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
70C. Approximately equal amounts of each tissue were homogenized
with à motorized tissue homogenizer (Brinkman, Inc.) into 2 ml of
guanidine thyocyanate solution (2.6 M guanidine thyocyanate, 9.2 mM n¬
laurel sarcosine, and 12.5 mM sodium citrate). 1.5 ml of homogenate was
layered over 550 ml of 5.7 M cesium chloride and centrifuged in a
Beckman RP 55-S Swinging Bucket Rotor for 3 hours at 55,000 rpm and 23
C. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 100 ul of TE-1% SDS, extracted with
phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. RNA concentrations were
determined using a spectrophotometer, and a small aliquot of RNA from
each tissue type was run on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide
to ensure there was no degradation.
RNAse protection assay. 105 cpm of 32P-labeled antisense HMSI probe
were hybridized to 10 ug of each type of RNA in 3 ul of hybridization
solution (4 M Nacl, 400 mM PIPES, and 10 mM EDTA) and 24 ul of
deionized 100% formamide. In addition, 105 cpm of HMSI probe were
hybridized to 10 ul of 10 mg/ml tRNA as a negative control. All
hybridization mixtures were heated to 85C for 5 minutes and then
incubated at 48°C overnight. RNase digestions were carried out by addition
of 300 ul of RNase solution (300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 10
ug/ml RNase A, and 0.4 ug/ml RNase TI) to each sample and incubation at
room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20
ul of 10% SDS and 2 ul of proteinase K (25 mg/ml) and incubation for 15
minutes at 37°C. Each sample was then phenol/chloroform extracted,
ethanol precipitated using 25 ug of tRNA as a carrier, resuspended in S ul
