labeling and primary structure have served to distinguish different types
of Na channels not only between species but also within individual
organisms (Shaller et al, 1992). Putative Na channels cloned and
sequenced from the optic lobe (SOSR22/2-7; Sato & Matsumoto, 1992) and
giant axon (GFLNI; Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993) of two presumably closely
related species of squid (Loligo bleekeri and Loligo opalescens,
respectively), for instance, display sequence differences in functionally
important regions of the channel protein and little overall amino acid
sequence identity (only 32%; Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993). Indeed, GELNI
demonstrates higher identity with Na channels found in vertebrate tissues
such as that isolated from electric eel electroplax (43%; Rosenthal & Gilly.
1993).
Little is presently known about multiple Na channel subtypes in
squid, but distinct Na channel species are likely to exist in different tissues.
Thus, GFLNI is expressed only at extremely low levels in the optic lobe of
L. opalescens (Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993), a complex region of the nervous
system undoubtedly rich in Na channels. In addition, voltage-clamp
exp√©riments on L. opalescens in our laboratory have indicated the
presence of Na channels with distinct kinetic properties in several types of
non-giant-axon-forming squid neurons and in mantle muscle cells. These
Na channels may have a different molecular identity from the GFLNI-type
channels in the giant axon of the same species. Further investigation into
molecular differences between these Na channels will be useful in
elucidating the mechanisms by which Na channels fulfill their specific
functional roles in cells of many species.
In this study, two RNA probes transcribed from segments of CDNA
encoding GFLNI were employed in in situ hybridizations and RNase
