of loading buffer (80% deionized formamide, IXTBE, and 0.1%
bromothymol blue), and run on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. 1000 cpm
of undigested HMSI and NZ5- probes were also run as markers. Kodak
XAR-S film using an intensifying screen was exposed to the gel overnight
at -70°C.
RESULTS
In situ hybridizations. Stellate ganglion (including GFL) is a known site
of GFLNI mRNA production (Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993) and was thus
selected as a positive control for both probes. In the stellate ganglion
sections, localization of probe was expected to be noted only in regions
containing cell bodies and not in regions consisting of neuropil (Fig. 24).
For both antisense probes (NZ5- and HMSI), this was seen to be the case
(Fig. 2B-C). Sections hybridized with sense NC5' probe displayed very little
background labeling (Fig. 2D).
Although both probes had a similar labeling pattern in the stellate
ganglion, an important difference in labeling between the two antisense
probes was apparent. Whereas NZ5- labeled GFL and non-GFL cell bodies
quite evenly (Fig. 2B), HMSI produced much stronger labeling in the non-
GFL portion of the ganglion (Fig. 20). This suggests that HMSI may detect
additional Na channel mRNAs not recognized by NZS¬
Probe-specific patterns of localized labeling were also evident in the
optic lobe with both antisense probes. In contrast, only very slight and
evenly distributed labeling by sense NC5' could be noted (Fig. 3B). NZS-
was observed to exclusively label very few cells along the inner granular
layer (Fig. 30). HMSI displayed a similar labeling pattern in the inner
