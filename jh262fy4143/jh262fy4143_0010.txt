Clearly attributing a specific role to each Na channel isoform based
on the results of this study is impossible. It is likely, however, that at least
one of the putative Na channel mRNAs detected in the stellate ganglion and
giant fiber lobe using GFLNI related probes corresponds to the much
studied Na channel of the giant axon. The larger cells in the inner and
outer granular layer regions of the optic lobe have distinctive
morphologies and patterns of positioning and are thought to be involved in
early-stage sensory integration within the optic lobe, whereas the more
poorly characterized, smaller cells in the medulla carry out additional
integration and transmit outputs to other portions of the nervous system
(Young, 1974). Distinct labeling was observed with both antisense probes
only in the inner granular layer of the optic lobe in large cells spaced quite
far apart. This result indicates that a putative Na channel mRNA identical
to GFLNI may be present in these cells. This conclusion is further
supported by the RNase protection assay results of Rosenthal & Gilly
(1993) noting a single fully protected band of extremely low abundance in
optic lobe RNA using NZ5- probe. Additional Na channel mRNAs in optic
lobe detected by HMSI probe appear to be more abundant and may relate
to the SOSR22/2-7 Na channel CDNA isolated in optic lobe of a similar
species of squid (Sato & Matsumoto, 1992). The absence of bands relating
to optic lobe Na channel mRNAs in the RNase protection assay using HMSI
probe can be attributed to a low ratio of Na channel mRNA species to total
RNA. A longer exposure time in the RNase protection assay is most likely
necessary to detect signal for Na channel mRNA in this tissue.
In in situ hybridizations carried out on mantle muscle tissue, both
antisense probes demonstrated labeling above the background level
produced by the sense probe. This observation suggests that Na channel
