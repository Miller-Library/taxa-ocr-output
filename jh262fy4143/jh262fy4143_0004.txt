were similarly transcribed from these plasmids in the presence of 125 uG
of 32PJ UTP.
In situ hybridizations. Adult stellate ganglion (including GFL), adult
optic lobe and 4-month-old mantle muscle tissues were dissected from live
squid (collected from Monterey Bay) and fixed for 1 hour in fresh, ice cold
4% paraformaldehyde in artificial sea water (ASW). Fixed tissue samples
were washed twice for 5 minutes in ASW, once for 5 minutes in a 1:1
dilution of ASW and PBS (pH 7.0), and once for 5 minutes in PBS (pH 7.0).
Samples were soaked twice for 40 minutes in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4°C (to
cryoprotect tissue from ice crystal damage during sectioning), frozen in
Polyfreeze (Polysciences. Inc.) using dry ice, and stored at -70'C. Tissue
was sectioned at 10 microns with a cryostat and affixed to silane coated
glass slides (Sigma).
In situ hybridizations with 358-labeled RNA probes were performed
on the tissue sections using the protocol outlined by Simmons et al (1989).
Following the hybridization procedures, slides were dipped in NBT-2
emulsion (melted and diluted 1:1 with dH20), allowed to dry vertically at
room temperature for 3 hours, stored at 4’C in light-proof containers with
desiccant for 12 days, and developed in Kodak D-19 for 4 minutes, dH20
stop bath for 15 seconds, and Kodak film strength rapid fixer for 4
minutes. Slides were then rinsed in running tap water for 1 hour, stained
in 0.5% cresyl violet and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). For
each tissue type, one slide was stained with Multiple Stain (Toluidine Blue
and Basic Fuchsin; Polysciences, Inc.) and mounted with Permount
immediately after sectioning for comparison with the in situ hybridized
slides.
