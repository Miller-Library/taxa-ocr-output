Detection of Sodium Channel Messenger RNA in the
Stellate Ganglion, Optic Lobe, and Mantle Muscle
of the Squid Loligo Opalescens
ABSTRACT
Different types of Na channels may be distinguished not only
between species but also within individual organisms. Investigations into
the differences between Na channel isoforms may be useful in elucidating
mechanisms by which Na channels carry out their specific functional roles
within cells. In this study, two RNA probes transcribed from segments of
CDNA encoding a putative squid giant axon Na channel (GFLNI) were
employed in in situ hybridizations and RNase protection assays to detec
Na channel messenger RNAs in the stellate ganglion, optic lobe and mantle
muscle of the squid Loligo opalescens. The results of this study indicate
the presence of additional Na channel mRNAs with partial sequence
homology to GFLNI mRNA in squid stellate ganglion and optic lobe, and
provide evidence for the expression of Na channel mRNA in mantle muscle
cells of L. opalescens.
INTRODUCTION
Na channels-the voltage-dependent ionic channels responsible for
generation of action potentials-display remarkably similar Na currents
across different phyla (Shaller et al, 1992). Despite this conservation in
functional properties, important differences in toxin sensitivity, antibody
