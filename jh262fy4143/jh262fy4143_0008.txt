DISCUSSION
The most important finding in the present study is that the HMSI
probe detects several types of putative Na channel mRNAs in stellate
ganglion and optic lobe tissues. This is indicated by the less specific
labeling of HMSI probe in in situ hybridizations (relative to that of NZS-
and by the appearance of several partially protected bands in RNase
protection assays employing HMSI probe. RNase protection assays
conducted by Rosenthal & Gilly (1993) on stellate ganglion and giant fiber
lobe RNA using antisense NZ5- probe detected only a single presumably
fully protected band for either tissue. The highly specific nature of the
NZ5- probe is not surprising, since it contains a large portion of 3
untranslated sequence for GFLNI. In contrast, HMSI probe consists
entirely of coding sequence and may thus be less specific than NZ5- and
capable of detecting Na channel mRNAs which are closely related to GFLNI
in the interdomain I-Il region. This explanation would account for the
differing results in the in situ hybridizations and RNase protection assays
with the two probes.
As noted in Figure 1B, HMSI probe corresponds to the second half of
interdomain I-Il of the Na channel protein, whereas NZS- probe relates to
the C-terminal end. Both of these regions lie in the cytoplasmic portions of
the protein (Fig. 1B). Comparisons of protein sequences in a variety of
isolated Na channels have shown that the cytoplasmic and extracellular
portions tend to be the most variable regions of the protein (Schaller et al.
1992). The degree of variability in the interdomain I-Il region for mRNAs
encoding squid Na channels requires further investigation, but the RNase
