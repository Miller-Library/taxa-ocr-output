protection assay results imply that one or two species must be identical to
GFLNI over a sizable portion of this region.
Na channel isoforms containing related but not identical amino acid
sequences in interdomain I-Il could arise from transcription of separate
genes, alternative splicing of mRNAs, or posttranslational modifications of
the proteins themselves. In studies conducted on related Na channel
mRNAs identified in rat brain and rat muscle, several forms were found to
be the consequence of alternative splicing in a region corresponding to the
second half of the interdomain I-Il portion of Na channel protein (Shaller
et al, 1992). Alternative splicing in the first cytoplasmic loop of a Na
channel mRNA has also been noted in Drosophila (Lougney et al, 1989).
In addition to being the site of structural diversity, the interdomain
l-Il loop is also the site of potential functional regulation. CAMPÂ¬
dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites present in this region (Rossie
et al, 1987) reduces peak Na currents (Li et al, 1993). The possibility thus
emerges that alternative splicing in this region could selectively express
sites that act to regulate functional aspects of channels and thereby
cellular excitability. In addition, it has been postulated that variations in
cytoplasmic domains such as the interdomain I-Il loop could play a role in
specifying the localization of Na channels to different areas within cells
(Schaller et al, 1992). The Na channels related to GFLNI found in this
study in the L. opalescens stellate ganglion and optic lobe show
considerable sequence homology in interdomain I-Il and may also result
from RNA splicing in this region. Again, changes in the amino acid
sequence in this cytoplasmic loop may endow Na channels with specialized
properties within each tissue type.
