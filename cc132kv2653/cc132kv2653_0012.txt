Appendix
Below is a schematic that explains how the computer quantifies bands. It was
taken from page 112 of the Pharmacia ImageMaster"" 1.0 Software manual.
In calculating band quantitation, the average optical density (O.D.) is first
determined across a row of pixels in a band. A specified band has N number of average
O.D. values. N is determined by band height. The wider apart the brackets, the more
average O.D. values will be included in the quantitation calculations.
The density trace is the average O.D. values that are plotted versus the width of
the band. The last step in calculating band quantitation is integrating under the curve to
the baseline, thereby giving units of O.D. x mm which is reported in the Abstract.
