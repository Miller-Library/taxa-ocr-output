Introduction
Anthopleura elegantissima comes in two varieties in the Monterey Bay. White
aposymbiotic anemones are found on rocks that are not exposed to sunlight; brown
symbiotic anemones thrive in the high intertidal under the sun's rays.
The symbiotic anemones have a relationship with dinoflagellates. These are
brown, unicellular algae that give the anemones their characteristic color (Smith and
Douglas, 1987). The algae are found in membrane-bounded vacuoles within the
endodermal cells and are localized in regions of the anemone that receive the most
sunlight. These areas are the tentacles and the oral disk (Shick, 1991). Besides
dinoflagellates, there may also be green algae, or zoochorellae, that have a symbiotic
relationship with the anemones (Muscatine, 1971).
There are many examples of metabolic exchange between the symbiont and host.
On a macroscopic scale the nutritional contribution of the symbiotic algae to the host is
suggested by the fact that aposymbiotic anemones lose weight more quickly than do their
symbiotic counterparts when both are subjected to starvation under light. In addition,
symbiotic anemones gain weight more quickly when fed in light than in the dark and lose
weight more quickly when starved in the dark than in the light (Shick, 1991).
Many past studies have focused on the transport of photosynthate to the host.
Fixed carbon moving from the algae to the host has been demonstrated. Nitrogen can
move in the reverse direction from the host to the algae (Smith and Douglas, 1987). In
