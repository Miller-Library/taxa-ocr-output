Aposymbiotic & symbiotic anemone collection and storage
Aposymbiotic sample collection involved scraping anemones off rocks below
Monterey Bay Aquarium. The symbiotic anemones were obtained from the high intertidal.
Sand and other debris were removed from the anemones. Aposymbiotic samples were
placed in salt water tanks exposed to artificial light. Symbiotic anemones were placed in
tanks outside under normal sunlight.
Protein extraction
The anemones were anesthetized in 1:1 volume 0.37 M MgCl: sea water. The
oral disk was removed from the anemones and the sample was homogenized in 1 ml buffer
on ice. The buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 0.45 MNaCl, and 1 mM PMSF.
Homogenized solutions were transferred to Corex tubes and more buffer was added to
make the total volume of the samples 1.5 ml. These were spun for 2.5 min at 1000 rpm to
remove the algae. All spins were performed at 10 Â°C and whenever possible, samples
were placed on ice.
After the spin, the supernatant was decanted to microcentrifuge tubes and set
aside. To the remaining algal pellet in the symbiotic sample and to the empty
aposymbiotic tube, 2 ml of buffer was added. These were spun at 1000 rpm for 2 min.
The supernatant was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes.
All microcentrifuge tubes were spun for 20 min at 15000 rpm to separate the
soluble and membrane protein fractions. The supernatant from the first soft spin tube was
