Figure Legends
Figure 1. The average KD size in this figure refers to the mean of the calculated band
sizes in both the aposymbiotic and symbiotic lanes. Lane number corresponds to
the numbering system of lanes found in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The matched bands
are numbered but do not correspond to the numbering system of the bands found
in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
Figure 2. Relative sizes of the molecular weight standard bands are labeled on the side of
lanes 4 and 5. Bands are numbered in order from the highest molecular weight
bands to the lowest molecular weight. A higher optical density of a band
compared with another signifies a greater presence of protein for that
corresponding molecular weight.
Figure 3. Relative sizes of the molecular weight standard bands are labeled on the side of
lanes 8 and 9.
