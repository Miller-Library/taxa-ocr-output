Gel electrophoresis
Once the protein sample concentrations were ascertained, 5 ug of membrane and
soluble protein were respectively prepared from aposymbiotic and symbiotic protein
samples. To the 5 ug samples, 5 ug of 2X solubilizing buffer was added. Samples were
boiled for 5 min and subsequently spun at 15000 rpm for another 5 min.
The samples and prestained molecular weight Sigma standard were loaded and run
in a 10% polyacrylamide gel at a constant 25 mA. The gel was stained overnight in
Coomassie Blue and subsequently destained in 10% acetic acid and 10% isopropanol.
Gel Analysis
Gel analysis was performed using the Pharmacia IM Desk Top Scanner and
Pharmacia software. The gel was scanned into the computer as an image. Background
was appropriately subtracted from the defined lanes. Bands were then specified, matched,
and then compared on the basis of optical density and band size calculated from the
standard lane.
