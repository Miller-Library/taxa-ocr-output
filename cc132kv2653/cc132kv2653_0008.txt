Discussion
Data analysis yielded evidence that there are some differences between proteins
found in the anemones. Qualitatively, membrane and soluble proteins were generally
analogous; quantitatively, however, soluble proteins showed differences in a 14 kD and
in a 106 KD protein.
The Bradford assay with BSA standards provided a reliable protein determination
curve with linear regression 0.998. Unfortunately, due to low volume of anemone
membrane protein sample, the membrane assays were performed only once and not in
duplicate. Despite the attempt to load equal quantities of protein, the aposymbiotic lane
in Figure 2 had consistently higher optical density readings than those in the symbiotic
lane. Qualitatively, however, many bands were able to be matched. Symbiotic bands
with optical density higher than 0.05 were used since readings below 0.05 fell too close to
background density. Accordingly, aposymbiotic bands with optical density lower than
0.10 were not used in qualitative analysis.
The soluble protein determination, however, provided a more reliable result. The
optical density readings were consistent throughout lanes 8 and 9 in Figure 3.
Quantitative as well as qualitative data could be used for soluble protein analysis.
Qualitatively, most symbiotic and aposymbiotic bands could be matched. The symbiotic
lane had more distinguishable bands. This may imply that symbiotic anemones have
different proteins than those found in aposymbiotic anemones, but it is more likely that
the missing proteins in the aposymbiotic lane did not resolve. The general optical density
