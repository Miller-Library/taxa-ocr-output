expressed in greater quantities in aposymbiotic anemones due to specific needs of
metabolism without sunlight
With these findings, the next step is to rerun the experiment with greater protein
quantity and to perform the Bradford assay in duplicate or triplicate. In addition,
different lanes could be run in the gel. Control lanes could be both symbiotic anemone and
algal proteins, and algal proteins alone. In this manner, algal proteins could be
ascertained to determine their contribution of bands to the gel. A Western blot could also
be performed testing for the presence of Rubisco to see if band 18 in Figure 3 is indeed the
14 kD subunit. In addition, a higher percentage SDS gel could be run to examine in detail
the low molecular weight proteins. Finally, a two dimensional gel could be executed to
further resolve the proteins isoelectrically.
This study strongly suggests that there are noticeable protein differences between
aposymbiotic and symbiotic Anthopleura elegantissima. Further experiments will be
needed to determine the identity of these proteins and the reason for the disparity of
occurrence between the anemones.
