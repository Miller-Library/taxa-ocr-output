Abstract
In the Monterey Bay, there are two types of Anthopleura elegantissima:
symbiotic and aposymbiotic. Symbiotic anemones have a relationship with unicellular
dinoflagellates. Algae are singly bound in membrane vacuoles within the endoderm of the
anemone. Aposymbiotic anemones do not have this association and probably do not have
the metabolic functions that are part of the symbiosis. Because of the differences in these
anemones, the hypothesis was established that there were protein differences between
aposymbiotic and symbiotic anemones.
Qualitatively, both membrane and soluble proteins in both anemones were
analogous. Quantitatively, however, disparate soluble protein quantities of sizes 106 kD
and 14 kD were found. The 14 kD protein was more prevalent in the symbiotic anemone
based on optical density readings taken from a scanned gel (0.292 vs. 0.057 Trace Optical
Density x mm); the 106 kD protein had a greater expression in the aposymbiotic
anemone (0.25 vs. 0.17). Further testing is needed to identify these proteins.
Please see Appendix for an explanation of band quantification.
