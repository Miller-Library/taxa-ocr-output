traces of both lanes were too consistent with each other to warrant an argument for the
lack of protein in the aposymbiotic anemone.
Qualitative analysis yielded some interesting implications. Match number 15 in
Figure 1 is a 14 KD protein. In Figure 3, this corresponds to band 18 in the symbiotic lane
and band 13 in the aposymbiotic lane. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase is an enzyme
that is found in chloroplasts. It has two subunits of size 56 kD and 14 kD (Stryer, 1988).
The presence of more 14 kD protein in the symbiotic lane implies that the algae were not
completely removed from the buffer during the soft spin. Given this, however, the 56 kD
protein should also have a higher optical density in this lane. In the 56 kD region of the
symbiotic lane, there is no band that has a notably higher optical density than the
corresponding band in the aposymbiotic lane. The identity of the 14 kD is left unknown;
cross referencing proteins of approximate size in an available 1968 CRC Handbook
yielded no satisfactory result.
In addition, the 40 kD soluble protein in Figure 1, which likely corresponds to
actin given experimental error, occurred in approximately two times greater quantity in
symbiotic anemones than in aposymbiotic anemones. This may imply that this protein
serves a greater metabolic role in symbiotic rather than aposymbiotic anemones.
Conversely, the matching 106 kD soluble protein found in Figure 1 raises another issue.
Apparently, the aposymbiotic anemone had a greater expression of a 106 kD protein than
in the symbiotic anemone. In Figure 3, this is seen in band 6 of the soluble symbiotic
protein and band 2 of the aposymbiotic protein. The identity of the protein is unknown,
but there may be a possible explanation for this phenomena. This protein may be
LAN 1O
