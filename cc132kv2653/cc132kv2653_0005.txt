decanted, this contained the soluble proteins. The supernatant from the second soft spin
tube was disposed. The membrane protein pellets in the microcentrifuge tubes were
resuspended and the solutions were transferred to two Corex tubes; one contained the
aposymbiotic sample and the other contained the symbiotic sample. Buffer was added to
make the solutions 10 ml. These tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 15000 rpm.
The supernatant from these tubes were disposed. The pellets were resuspended in
300 ul 2% SDS solution made from the above buffer. One scoop of glass beads was
added to both tubes and the tubes were vortexed to eliminate bubbles. The resulting fluid
was decanted and saved in a microcentrifuge tube. This sample contained the membrane
protein fraction. The final step was a 5 min spin at 15000 rpm to remove debris.
Bradford Assay
From both membrane and soluble protein samples from aposymbiotic and
symbiotic anemones, 10 ul and 100 ul fractions were taken. To the 10 ul fraction, 90 ul
of the 2% SDS buffer was added. The blank was 50 ul 1.0 N NaÃ–H.
Fifty ul 72% TCA was added to all tubes. These were vortexed for 5 min and
subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 15000 rpm. 50 ul 1.0 N HCl was added to the
pellets. Fluid was transferred to large test tubes and 5 ml P-250 Coomassie protein
determination reagent was added. Large test tubes were immediately vortexed.
Beckman spectrophotometer readings were obtained using visible light at 595 7
utilizing the blanker as the calibration. The standard curve was produced by using 100 ul
aliquots of BSA in concentrations of 75, 100, 250, 500 ug/ml.
