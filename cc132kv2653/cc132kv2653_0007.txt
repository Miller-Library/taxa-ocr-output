Results
Figures 1-3 were the product of computer analysis. Figure 1 displays matching
bands which were defined on the computer for both membrane and soluble protein.
Matching bands were determined from the proximity and relative heights of the optical
density peaks in Figures 2 and 3.
Figure 2 shows a membrane protein comparison between symbiotic and
aposymbiotic samples. Every peak from the aposymbiotic graph is consistently higher
than those found in the symbiotic graph. Band numbers 1 through 6 in both lanes
correspond to matches. In addition, band numbers 9 and 12 from the membrane
symbiotic lane respectively correspond to the membrane aposymbiotic bands 12 and 15.
Figure 3 shows a soluble protein comparison. Matched bands for this figure are
also displayed in Figure 1. More bands were able to be defined for the symbiotic protein.
The most significant quantitative differences between symbiotic and aposymbiotic soluble
proteins were band matches 7 and 15 in Figure 1. These respectively correspond to 106
KD and 14 KD proteins as labeled in Figure 3.
