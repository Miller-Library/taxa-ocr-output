Results
In figure 1, alginase activity, as measured by
viscosimetry, in algae undergoing decomposition on the
beach is shown to increase for the first six days.
Two forms of bacteria showing marked differences in
colonial morphology were isolated; a white colonial form,
found at every sampling and comprised of actively motile,
rod-shaped organisms 2x.5 microns; and a brown colonial
form, found only on algae that had been on the beach for at
least two days and comprised of motile, rod-shaped bacteria,
1.5x.5 microns. Both the brown and the white colonial
forms showed alginase activity in their ability to liquify
an alginate gel within 48 hours. Culture supernatants
prpared using alginate liquid medium contained alginase
activity (figure 2). Little activity remained with the
cells themselves. Boiling moderately reduced alginase activity.
Adding additional enzyme after 2 hours of digestion had
no further effect on viscosity as compared with dilution
with an equal volume of water. In all preparations tested,
80-90% of the decrease in viscosity evident after the
addition of enzyme suspension occurredwithin the first
5 minutes. No difference in the specificity of the two
bacterial enzymes could be demonstrated by a study of mixtures.
The spectrophotometric assay of Nakada & Sweeney (1967) did not
indicate that the bacterial enzymes function as eliminases.
Discussion
Alginase activity of decomposing Macrocystis is maximal
after six days of decomposition. Two forms of bacteria
capable of using alginate as a sole carbon source were
