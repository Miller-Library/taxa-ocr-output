isolated from this decomposing material. Enzyme preparations
from both forms behave very similarly. No synergistic
effect could be demonstrated when the enzymes were tested
in combination. This enzyme acts extra-cellularly and
is relatively heat-stable, suffering only 30% inactivation
after 1 hour at 100Â°C. No eliminase activity like that
described by Nakada and Sweeney (1967) was observed in the
cultures or culture supernatants. These experiments
suggest that the rate of decomposition of alginate is
directly a function of the amount of hydrolytic alginase
present and active. The use of viscosimetry for the
assay of alginase activity has proved to be an accurate
means for measuring this enzyme in a variety of materials.
Alginate as an energy-rich food source to the sandy beach
community appears to be made available to non-alginase
producing organisms through microbial activity.
