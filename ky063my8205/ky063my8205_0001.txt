The vast beds of the giant kelp Macrocystis in
Monterey Bay provide a major source of food for beach
fauna in the form of wrack. A major component poly
saccharide in Macrocystis, alginic acid, has been
shown to be digestible by a number of invertebrates
(Meeuse & Fleugel, 1958; Eppley & Lasker, 1959; Oshima
1931; Galli & Giese, 1959; Fraussen & Jeuniaux, 1965;
Favorov & Vaskovsky, 1971). This polysaccharide con-
stitutes up to 30% of the dry weight of Phaeophytes (Haug
& Larsen,1965). However, all of those shown to digest
alginate are subtidal or very low intertidal dwellers;
there has been reported no direct use of this polysaccharide
by fauna of the sandy beach. A number of bacteria capable
of hydrolyzing alginate have been described (Kooiman. 1954;
Waksman, 1934). Working with the abalone Haliotis, Nakada
& Sweeney (1967) have isolated two different alginases;
alginases I rapidly reduces the viscosity of an alginate
broth, apparently by cleaving internal Ã¸1,4, glycosidic
linkages. Alginase II shows almost no activity when assayed
by viscosimetry, but spectrophotometric assays suggest that
it catalyzes an eliminase reaction, attacking the ends of
the polymer and releasing diuronide units. Though alginase
producing bacteria have been found, the nature of their
decomposition of alginate is unclear. Furthermore, no
attempt has been made to correllate their activity with
the import of food to the beach community. Thus, this
study of the decomposition of alginic acid by bacteria of
Macrocystis was undertaken.
