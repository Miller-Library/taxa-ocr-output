Materials and Methods
Large samples of M. pyrifera and M. integrefolia
were cut from the beds off the Hopkins Marine Station
and placed on the beach above the high tide mark. Samples
from these piles were taken from moist fronds that lay
immediately below the dried, crusty surface layer.
Enzyme assays: One disk (diameter 2.4 cm) of alga
was cut and shaken in 10 ml distilled water with a vortex
mixer for 30 seconds. One ml of this suspension was
added to 5 ml 0.25% Na alginate (Keltone, supplied by the
Kelco Co., Los Angeles). Viscosity was determined after
a variable incubation period by adding 3 ml of the test
solution to an Ostwald viscosimeter at 25°C. Standards
of distilled water were tested with each sample. Glucuronic
acid and 0.25% Na alginate were used as reference materials.
Culture media: Alginase-producing bacteria were
isolated from decomposing Macrocystis by inoculating
alginate-agar plates (2% agar; 0.5% Ca alginate; 0.1% KH2PO4:
0.02% KpHPOp: 0.1% yeast extract; in 3.5% artificial sea
water) with suspensions derived from shaking one algal
disk in 10 ml sterile artificial sea water. Colonies
thus isolated were grown in alginate liquid medium (as
above, except Na alginate was used in place of Ca alginate)
for 48 hours at 25°C. Two aliquots of this medium were cen
trifuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes; two aliquots were heated
in a boiling water bath for 1 hour. Samples of the medium,
the supernatant, the pellet, and the heated preparations were
assayed for alginase activity by viscosimetry. Samples were
also tested for alginase activity spectrophotometrically by
the method of Nakada (1960).
