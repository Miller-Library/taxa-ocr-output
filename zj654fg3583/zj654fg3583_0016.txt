Map of study sites in Central California.
Water temperatures at Soberanes Point and Hopkins Marine Station, from AprilÂ¬
May 2001. High tide water temperatures were calculated as the mean temperature
during a four-hour period centered around each high tide.
Balanus glandula embryo sizes at Central California study sites. Light gray
represents bay sites, dark gray represents open coast sites; sites are arranged in
order of increasing latitude from left to right. Error bars are the standard error for
embryo size for n=15 individuals at each site.
Balanus glandula embryo sizes at open coast study sites across a latitudinal
gradient. Sites are arranged in order of increasing latitude from left to right. Error
bars are the standard error for embryo size for n-15 individuals at each site.
Water temperatures at Fogarty Creek, Oregon, and Soberanes Point, California
from April-May 2001. High tide water temperatures were calculated as the mean
temperature during a four-hour period centered around each high tide.
Satellite image of Southern California representing water temperature on an
average day in May. The star in the lower right corner denotes the location of
Scripps Pier.
Balanus glandula reproductive effort at Central California study sites. Light gray
represents bay sites, dark gray represents open coast sites; sites are arranged in
order of increasing latitude from left to right. Error bars are the standard error for
reproductive effort for n-15 individuals at each site.
