Embryo size
While temperature appears to play an important role in embryo size within the Central
California populations, this trend seems to disappear on a wider geographic scale. The reliability
of this comparison is somewhat uncertain because the barnacles collected from Oregon and San
Diego were sent to me from sites I never visited. Consequently, I am unfamiliar with the
characteristics of these sites, and cannot confirm that they are truly representative of the areas
from which they came. Also, the barnacles from San Diego and Oregon were collected from
slightly higher tidal heights than those from Central California, which could influence embryo
size. Fürthermore, one site representing the north and one representing the south may simply not
provide enough spatial replication to document any latitudinal trend that might exist.
Nevertheless, these data suggest that temperature is not the sole factor determining embryo size
over such a wide spatial scale. Although larger embryos were observed in colder environments,
à survey of Semibalanus balanoides embryo sizes also revealed the lack of a consistent
latitudinal trend (Barnes and Barnes 1965). In any case, the observation that open coast (rather
than bay) habitat produces larger, and thus perhaps higher quality embryos is arguably more
important to marine reserve design than specifying the desirable latitude at which to site reserves
for a given species.
An unanswered question is why temperature has the effect it does on embryo
development (Crisp and Patel 1960). It has not yet been determined whether the difference in
embryo size resulting from development at different temperatures actually signifies a difference
in embryo dry weight. If embryos developing at colder temperatures are not only greater in size,
but in mass, how is additional mass gained? Are embryos at colder temperatures simply more
metabolically efficient, using up less of what they start out with? Or is it possible for nutrients to
