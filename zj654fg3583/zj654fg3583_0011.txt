considered. It could be that barnacles from the three northern sites are on an earlier reproductive
schedule than barnacles from the southern sites. For example, when secondary collections were
made in late May at Soberanes Point and Moss Landing, it seemed that a much greater
abundance of barnacles were brooding or had ripe ovaries at Soberanes Point than at Moss
Länding. If southern sites are one or more broods behind northern sites and brood size is
dependent on how many times the adult has already reproduced that season, the perceived
difference in brood size from these populations may be an artifact of this asynchronous release.
Of course, the assumed asynchronous release at Soberanes Point and Moss Landing could be
representing a difference in bay vs. open coast populations rather than northern vs. southern.
Asynchronous release may also be distorting data on larval quality, since similar patterns of
embryo size declining with later broods have been described for Balanus glandula and other
barnacles (Barnes 1953, Stathmann 1987). The possibility of asynchronous release must be
more explicitly examined
Achieving an understanding of reproductive effort and factors that contribute to its
magnitude would be a huge stride for marine reserve design. Combining this quantitative
measurement of reproduction with more qualitative measurements such as embryo size, as well
as performance and survival rates, would greatly augment the steadily growing base of
knowledge about source-sink dynamics in the coastal ocean. This study addresses only a few of
the complications involved in considering reproduction in a model organism, and reproduction is
only one facet of the problem of identifying source habitat, but it is a good starting point for
fürther research. The observed differences in reproductive effort and embryo size among such
closely spaced sites is surprising and adds further complexity to the design of marine reserves;
