(20.Img), so this amount was considered insignificant in the measurement of the overall mass of
the embryos.
Reproductive effort was calculated by dividing the number of embryos by the dry mass of
the soft body (normalized to 10 mg, a typical dry body weight for barnacle samples). The total
number of embryos in an egg mass was estimated from five individuals from Moss Landing
(representing bay sites) and five from Soberanes Point (representing the open coast sites) by
diluting the egg mass homogenously in ImL of a 100:3 solution of distilled water and ethanol,
averaging the counts from five sub-samples of 0.002mL each, and multiplying by the total
volume. The solution was then dried at 70Â°C for 24 hours until only the dried egg mass
remained. From the weights of these dried egg masses, separate conversion factors (number of
embryos/gegg mass) were calculated for bay and open coast barnacles, and all dried egg weights
were converted to number of embryos per individual.
RESULTS
Embryo size
As predicted, embryo length from barnacles within Central California was correlated with
temperature. Embryos were on average 10% longer (ANOVA, p0.01, Table la) in the colder
open coast sites (Fig. 2a) than the bay sites, with means of 233um and 212um, respectively (Fig.
2b). Embryo size was not significantly related to barnacle size (p#0.33) at any of the study
sites, at least within the relatively narrow range of barnacle sizes collected. The latitudinal
comparison, however, did not coincide with the predicted outcome. Fogarty Creek in Oregon,
being the farthest north, was expected to be the coldest site and as a result have the largest
