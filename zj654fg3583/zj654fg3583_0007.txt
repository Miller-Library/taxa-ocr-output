embryos. However, among all embryos from open coast sites, those from Central Calfornia were
the largest (233um), followed by Oregon (226um), and then San Diego (223um). The only
significant difference in embryo size (p0.01, Table 1b) that existed between these populations
was Central Cailfornia vs. San Diego (Fig. 3a). The 0.3°C temperature difference between
Soberanes Point and Fogarty Creek (Fig. 3b) should not have substantially affected embryo size.
San Diego water temperature, however, was an average of 7°C warmer (Fig. 3c) than the sites to
the north of it.
Reproductive effort
Reproductive effort was not correlated with habitat type (bay or open coast); instead, a
division was seen between northern and southern sites (p#0.01, Table 1c). The barnacles at the
northern sites, Moss Landing (bay), Santa Cruz (bay), and Pigeon Point (coast), had roughly half
the reproductive effort (from 6.6 to 10 thousand embryos/ lOmg dry soft body mass) of those at
Soberanes Point (coast), Mal Paso Creek (coast), and Hopkins (bay) (from 16.8 to 21 thousand
embryos/ lOmg dry soft body mass) (Fig. 4). Again, there was no significant correlation
between barnacle size and reproductive effort (p20.37).
DISCUSSION
These data suggest that there are significant differences in the reproduction between
Balanus glandula populations within Monterey Bay and on the open coast. These differences in
embryo size and reproductive effort may have important consequences for the replenishment of
local populations in Central California.
