careful research and planning are necessary, since it has been shown here that it cannot be
assumed that sites in a fairly narrow geographic region are of equivalent habitat quality. The
prospect of designing reserves for multiple species with different life histories complicates
matters further, and raises an unknown question: do species share common source habitat? Only
through constant reevaluation and extension of ideas such as those presented here will progress
be made toward more successful implementation of marine reserves as reproductive sources.
