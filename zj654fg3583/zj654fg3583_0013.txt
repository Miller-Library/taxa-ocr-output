Acknowledgements
I would first like to thank Michelle Phillips for cheerfully accompanying me on trips into the
intertidal at four in the morning to catch the low tide. I am also indebted to George Somero for
the freedom he has afforded me in his lab, to Mark Denny for his critical thinking that kept some
of my more outrageous claims grounded in reality, and to Jim Watanabe for his patience with me
and my rather rudimentary understanding of statistics. I thank my fellow students in 175H for
their support and commiseration after long nights in the lab, and for reminding me that many
things may look better in the morning. Finally, I am eternally grateful to my primary advisor,
Eric Sanford, for generously lending his expertise and his time in the field during my collection
process, for offering insight and encouragement all along the way, for his shrewd (if painfully
thorough) editing skills, and for sparking my interest in this project in the first place.
