INTRODUCTION
The worldâ€™s fisheries are in dire straits; over 65% have been classified as heavily
exploited, overexploited, or depleted (NRC 1999). It is thought that marine reserves could help
mitigate this problem, serving as reproductive sources to replenish nearby systems, including
fisheries (Murray et al. 1999, Crowder et al. 2000, Dayton et al. 2000). Unfortunately, there are
few documented success stories of fisheries enhancement through the establishment of marine
reserves (Tegner 1993). There are many possible reasons for this. For example, the general lack
of unexploited marine ecosystems to serve as baseline controls results in relatively low statistical
power when trying to detect any changes in the system under scrutiny. The policies governing
marine reserves are also fairly weak. Definitions of marine reserves are vague, the regulations
they impose on the public are few, and the enforcement of those regulations is virtually
nonexistent (Allison et al. 1998). Socioeconomic pressures often cause marine reserves to be
placed in suboptimal habitat, since fishermen naturally recognize productive systems and
strongly oppose any restrictions applied to those areas.
Even if these logistical and political difficulties are overcome, however, the question
remains of where to site marine reserves. Understanding source-sink dynamics is necessary to
ensure that the effort involved in setting up a reserve is not wasted, or worse yet, detrimental to
the system. Crowder et al. (2000) showed that a reserve sited in sink habitat could actually result
in a reduction in the overall population if total fishing effort were displaced rather than reduced.
putting heavier fishing pressure on remaining unregulated marine areas, some of which may be
source habitat. Identifying appropriate source habitats, then, becomes a crucial step in successful
design of marine reserves.
