Additionally, differences between bay and open coast habitat provide an opportunity to
test the effect of temperature on reproduction over a much smaller geographic scale. Water
temperatures within Monterey Bay are 2 to 3Â°C warmer than on the nearby open coast during
periods of spring upwelling, which coincides with B. glandula's brooding season. Thus, larger
larvae may be exported from open coast sites than from locations within the bay. Furthermore, it
is possible that bay habitat may be at an advantage over open coast habitat as far as larval
quantity is concerned. Higher food availability (measured in terms of chlorophyll-a) was found
in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island than on the open coasts, and as a result, bay barnacles had
higher growth rates and allocated more resources to reproduction (Bertness et al. 1991). Similar
conditions may exist in Monterey and other bays since these areas often receive high nutrient
input. If this is true, then barnacles in Monterey Bay may produce and export more larvae per
adult than those living on the open coast. The goal of this study was to test whether the patterns
of reproduction described above hold true for Central California bay and open coast habitat, and
whether any overlap in habitat type exists that would make it possible to optimize both larval
quantity and quality in siting marine reserves within this region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field collections. Balanus glandula were collected on the central coast of California
from three open coast sites (Soberanes Point and Mal Paso Creek south of Monterey Bay, and
Pigeon Point in the north) and three sites within Monterey Bay (Hopkins Marine Station, Moss
Landing, and Santa Cruz) (Appendix, Fig. 1). To extend the geographic comparison of embryo
size, barnacles were also collected from Fogarty Creek, Oregon, and the Scripps Pier in San
