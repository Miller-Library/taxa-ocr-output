tissues, lethva aurantium and Hicrociona proliferadid not show ant ibody
recognition, indicating a lack of a similar cross-reacting protein.
Hemigrapsus oregonensis Macoma nasuta, Chlamys hastata, and
Metibe leoninasnowed cross reactions at different molecular weights that
were smudged. It is not clear whether there is a distinct protein.
DISCUSSION
The results indicate MDR like transport activity in Urechiseggs,
Ascidianeggs, and muscle tussue. Such activity does not appear to be
present in echinoderm eggs. Although the evidence is limited, it suggests
that MOR like transport activity is correlated with a filter feeding lifestyle
Fluorescence assays and Western blots indicate that the sea urchins,
S purpuratus and L. pictus and the sand dollar D excentricusdo not have
PIDR transport activity and do not have cross-reactivity to the C219
antibody. The sea stars P miniataand H leviuscula do not possess a
related protein and it is unclear whether the clam M nasuta the crab H
oregonensis or the scallop C hastata have a cross-reacting protein.
Altnough the C219 monoclonal antibody does not show cross-reactivity in
tne marine sponges Tethva aurant ium and Microciona prolifera it is again
unciear as to whether there is similar protein activity, due to conflicting
evigence by Kurelec and Pivcevic (in press). Finally, fluorescence activity
assavs and western blots clearly indicate the presence of an MDR like
transport activity in the mussel Mytilus californianus the tunicate Ascidia
ceratodes and Urechis caupa
