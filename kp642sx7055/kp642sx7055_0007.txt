and 25ul of zuh verapamil were added to one aliquot for a lOug/ml final
concentration Tne samples were incupated for 1 hour at 162C, hand
centrifuged, washed out the Rhodamine supernatant, and then resuspend in
-2miFSw. Tne cells were immediately positioned under a 40X lens of an
epifluorescence microscope and the aperature was closed to a fixed point.
Fluorescence measurements were taken on 10 individual healthy eggs by a
phofo sensing device attacned to the microscope. Using those readings
means and standard deviations were calculated. The above procedure was
followed for both fertilized and unfertilized eggs for all organisms for
which oocvres were availaple.
