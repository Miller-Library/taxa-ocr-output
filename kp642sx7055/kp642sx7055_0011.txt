As both, the fluorescence assay indicated activity and the Western
blot resulted in a positive cross reaction, it is possible to conclude that
Urechis caupoand Ascidia ceratodeshave a MDR-like gene which produces a
multi-xenobiotic resistance protein in its eggs. However, as Iwas unable to
defect tne presence of the protein in adult tissue, the organism may stop
proaucing the protein if it is no longer necessary. Both of these organisms
nave a thick epigermis that may serve to protect it from toxins, thereby
making the protein obsolete in the adult. Also, due to problems with
smudging in the western blots, organismal gut tissue needs to be retested
to form conclusions. Both of these organisms are filter feeding and reside
in toxin filled environments.
Mytilus californianisgill and mantle tissues reacted positively with
the C219 monoclonal antibody for a 138 kD protein. As the mussel was past
its spawning season ! was unable to conduct assays on its oocytes. This
filter feeder also showed cross reactions at higher (200 KD) and lower (34
kD) molecular weights. This could be because more than one protein with a
similar sequence and/or function is present, though lower molecular weight
bands are most likely the result of protease degradation.
Negative fluorescence assay results from sea urchin and sand dollar
eggs indicate that as these organisms show no differences in fluorescence,
there appears to be no transport protein activity of Rhodamine B. Also,
negative results on the immunoblots for these organisms and sea stars
indicate that the protein is not present in the organisms. Though the results
are not conclusive in themselves, they lead me to believe that echinoderms
do not possess a MDR like transport protein.
Assay attempts on the marine sponges Microcionaand Tethyawere
inconclusive. Individual cell dissociation, though possible, are very
