protein with similar function as the mammalian MDR p-glycoprotein. Lower
molecular weight bands such as in Hemigrapsus oregonensisor Ascidian
eggs, could be the result of protease degradation of a larger protein.
Attempts at using protease inhibitors such as EDTA, PMSF, and soybean
trypsin innibitor appeared not to be successful in preventing protein break
down if it had occurred. However, as isolation of the active protease is
often difficult, 1 may not be inhibiting the correct protease.
It was not possible to conduct fluorescence assays on individual cells
of many organisms as it is difficult to get gametes or dissociate tissue. In
some cases, the organism was not gravid or was past its sp√•wning season.
In others, the cells were not usable with this assay. For example, mediaster
produces eggs that are naturally fluorescent thereby making individual
fluorescence readings meaningless. Also, sponge tissue cells were too
small to conduct quant if iable fluorescence readings without high amounts
of background fluorescence interference
My results indicate that multi-xenobiotic resistance activity is
associated with filter feeders. The Urechis caupo, Mytilus californianis,
and Asciala ceratodesare all filter feeders that habitate polluted
environments. Vrechig a sediment dweller, is exposed to concentrated
man-made and natural noxious substances. Mytilus californianusis also a
resident of the sediments. The Ascigianis found under floats in Monterey
Marina wnich is depositea with pollutants. The echinoderms, on the other
hand live in sandy/rocky, relat ively unpolluted habitats, and may not need
and tnus nave not developed such xenobiotic resistance activity.
