fransferred to new Eppenaorf tubes, and the remaining pellet discarded.
Prorein concentrations were obtained by preparing 1.20, 1.50, or 1:100
iutions of each sample. 5 ul samples of each dilution were placed in
triplicare on a 96 weil micro-titer plate. A bicinchonic acid (BCA) assay
ution was prepared and löoul of the BCA/copper sulfate solution was
reacted witn each dijution sample overnignt. The protein concentration was
read using a Molecular Devices VHax plate reader at 560 nm.
Gel eiectropnoresis and western piotting.
Samples were loaded onto a 7 5% polyacrylamide gel at approximately zoug
per lane The proreins were separated on a BioRad minigel apparatus using a
fris/giveine running puf fer and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
Using à BioRag electrophoretic transfer system. The transfer occured over
voitage agjusted to 13 v for 1 hour, 24 V for 3 hours, and 36 V overnignt.
ne biots were blocked with PBS-Tween 20 (0.052)- BSA (10mM) for a half
hour and then incubateg for 3 hours with C219 monoclonal antibody (1:1000
in PBS- ween 20-BSA) commercially available from Centocor. The
nitrocellulose membrane was washed for 10 minutes with 1Omls of the
PRS-Iween 20-PBS blocking solution three times and then incubated for1
nour with goat anti-rapbit alkaline phosphatase con jugated antibody (Sigma)
1000 in PBS-Tween 20-BSA). It is then washed three times for 10
minutes each witn 10 mi of PBS-Tween 20 (0.057) and incubated in apH 9.5
