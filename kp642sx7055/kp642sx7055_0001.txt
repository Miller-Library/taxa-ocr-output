THF PRESENCE OF MULTI-XENOBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN MARINE
INVERTEBRATES
ARDIHAU
A multi-xenopiotic resistance p-glycoprotein transport activity
iinked wirn tne multi-drug resistance pnenomenon isolated in human tumor
ceils nas peen tound in various marine invertebrates. Indiviqual cells,
assessed by fluorescence microscopy, possess a Rhodamine B efflux activity
whicn can pe innivitea by Verapamil, a p-glycoprotein transport innibitor.
in addition western piot analvsis indicates the presence a protein of a
similar mojecular weight to the mammalian p-glycoprotein. This activity
appears ro pe a filter feeding lifestyle-linked phenomenon and was found in
Crecnis caupoegqs, Asciaia ceratodeseggs, and Mytilus californianusgil
and mantel tissues. The recognition that marine invertebrates exposed to
man-made and natural noxious substances may possess a multi-xenobiotic
resistance activity is essential to our understanding of organismal
detoxification mecnanisms and the biological impact of pollution and could
be usetil in risk assessment for regulatory policy.
