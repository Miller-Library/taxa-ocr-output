Fuitidrug resistance, has been studied in humans and mammals, but
iffle researen nas examined this phenomenon as a xenobiot ic extrusion
mechanism in tne marine environment. Kurelec and Pivcevic have shown p-
jp linked poilution-resistance activity in musseis (1991) and sponges
Submitrea) in adaition, Barpara Toomey in David Epel's lab has observed
such activity in Urechis caupo 1 am looking for the activity and presence of
p-gp in various marine invertebrates and whether it is correlated with
napirat and/or lifestyle.
My activity assay invoives using fluorescence microscopy to quantify
gifferences in xenobiotic concentration in single cells (oocytes) with and
withouf a p-glycoprotein transport inhibitor. Both fertilized and
unferrilized eggs are incubated in a xenobiotic like fluorescent dye
Rnodamine B with and without Verapamil, a molecule found to bind
specirically to the active site of the P-glycoprotein, thereby inhibiting
pinding of other xenopiotics. After incubation, individual cell fluorescence
was measured In the absence of protein activity the cells fluoresce more.
For organisms tnat snow little or no difference, assumed that xepobjotic
resistance transport activity was minimal or non-existent. (fig. 3)
in addition,! prepared protein samples from various organismal
riesues for protein immunoplots (western blots). Using a mammalian
monocional antipody, C219, selected from hybridomas proguceg from
spienocvtes of mice immunized with SDS-solubilized plasma mempranes of
