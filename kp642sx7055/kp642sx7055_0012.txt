difficult as many other symbiotic organisms live in sponge tissue and must
be separated from the sponge cells. In addition, individual cells were too
small to recora conclusive fluorescence readings due to high background
fuorescence interference. Despite these problems, the results from these
say attempts gave positive activity indications. Western blotting, on the
ofher hand, showed no cross reaction, though, Kurelec and Pivcevic from
vugoslavia have detected an MDR like 125 KD protein in Tethya with a
polyclonal ant ibody (submitted) and have noted xenobiotic resistance
activity in tissue with radiolabelled drugs (submitted). This conflicting
evidence may be explained by the fact that the sponge is an extremely
primitive organism as compared to the mammals from which the C219
monoclonal antibody is created and that may be too specific, as this MDR¬
like transporter is likely to have evolved significantly. This also indicates
that other organisms have screened may also possess such a protein that
is not detectable with the C219 monoclonal antibody.
Immunoblot cross reactions at different molecular weights indicate
that there is likely to be a protein similar to the MDR p-glycoprotein. As
the monoclonal antibody is specific for the ATP binding cassette in the C
terminal region of the 170 kD mammalian MDR P-gp, it is quiet specific.
However, it is still general enough to have some degree of error by cross
reacting to other protein ATP binding cassettes with similar sequences.
Therefore, à negative cross reaction, though somewhat inconclusive has high
propability of indicating lack of protein. Ambiquous (smudged) positive
cross reactions may be the result of a cross reacting protein that had been
dégraded, put without a clear band are inconclusive. Positive cross
reactions at molecular weights differing from the 170 KD mammalian p¬
giycoprotein can be explained by evolutionary differences across phyla in a
