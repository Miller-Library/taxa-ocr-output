FLOURIMIETRIC ASSAY
Urechis caupoand Ascidia ceratodeseggs show a transport act ivity
characteristic of MDR activity. As seen by figures 4 and 5, eggs incubated
only with Rhodamine B exhibit less fluorescence then those incubated in dve
plus verapamil, the MIDR activity inhibitor. Vrechiseggs normally contain
0% -25% of the Rhodamine B concentrated by eggs in which the transport
activity is inhibited. Ascidianeggs normally concentrate only 252 - 502 of
that in with which transport activity is inhibited.
Experiments conducted on Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Lytechinus
oictus and Dendraster excentricusshowed no detectable MDR transport
activity. As shown by figures 6 and 7, there is little difference between
samples incubated with and without Verapamil. Therefore these organisms
do not appear to nave the MDR activity.
PTIUNOBLOTS
Western blots on Urechis caupoeggs, Ascidianeggs, and Mytilus
calirornianisgill and mantle tissue showed a positive cross reaction with
the C219 mammalian monoclonal antibody. The bands were 142 KD. 146 kD.
and 138 ku respectively, indicating that these organisms have a protein that
is aifferent, though close in molecular weight to the 170 kD mammalian pÂ¬
qivcoprotein responsible for MDR activity. In addition the Mtilus gill and
mantel tissue and the Asciaianeggs had cross reacting bands for proteins of
different molecular weights. The mussel had a 200 kD band and both had 34
KU pangs.
