INTRODUCTION
Many marine organisms survive and successfully reproduce in highly
pollured environments Some nave adapted to environments with high
loncentrarions of potentialiv cytotoxic hydrophobic organic compounds

nuindréds of man-made and natural toxins. (fig. 1) Such marine and estuarian
organisms employ xenopiotic resistance detoxification mechanisms of
which very uttie is understood.
In the past numerous studies on the effects of various pollutants on
marine organisms have been conducted. However, few detoxification
mechanisms nave been identified or are understood. Among these are
cytochrome P-450 detoxification; glutathione con jugation mechanisms;
stress proteins, such as heat shock proteins, and mixed function oxidases
(PFOs). Some of these mechanisms are not active in lower marine
inverteprates In fact, little work can explain which or how many
mecnanisms are employed in many invertebrates.
One recently suggested mechanism is similar to the multidrug
