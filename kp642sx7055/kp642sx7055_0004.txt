The L-Terminai region of tne ATP binding cassette of the P-gp polypeptide in
a diversity of organisms.
with f√ºrther studies, this information could reveal a novel mechanism
ny which marine organisms survive natur al piant and animal toxins, as well
47 nesticides and otner man-made environment al pollutants. It could
provide insignts into tne evoiutionary origin of this protein, ang may allow
develonment of befrer EPA poilution tests. It might even further our
kliowiedge of numan multigrug resistance activity. It would certaiply help
70 exolain why some organisms are able to survive exposures to a diversity
of xenopiotic compounds.
