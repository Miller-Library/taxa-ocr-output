This represents the decay of the e.p.p. over 3 minutes. Block accomplished
with 100 uM of curare. Shocks were 2.2 V. and lasted for 0.4 msec.
FIG. 7. (a) Block of force generated with 100 nM TTX.
Indirectly applied shocks consisted of 40 V. and lasted 0.4 msec. (b) Time
course of 7a.
FIG. 8 Phar macology of the extraocular preparation.
There is a block of force due to 0.3 mM omega conatoxin, 200 uM curare, and
200 nM TTX. However, there is no apparent effect due to the application of
0.6 mM of paralytic peptide. Shocks were delivered indirectly at 0.6 V. for
durations of 0.4 msec. They were delivered at tetani of 200 Hz. for 0.5 sec.
