FIGURE LEGENDS
FIG. 1. Schematic of fin spine preparation.
This depicts a representation of the skeletal components, muscle, and nerves
which control the fin spine. See text for details.
FIG. 2. Relationship between force generated and muscle stretch.
Single indirect shocks of 10 V. were applied for a duration of 0.4 msec each.
FIG. 3. The relationship between force generated and voltage applied.
(a) Indirect shocks lasting 0.4 ms were delivered at frequencies of 200 Hz.
for 0.5 sec. to the extraocular preparation. (b) Single shocks of 0.4 ms were
delivered to the fin spine muscles.
FIG.Aa. Properties of end plate potentials.
An end plate potential is produced by a 2.2 V. shock of 0.4 msec. (b). A
picture of the e.p.p. produced as the electrode is moved closer to the
endplate band. (c) This shows that the same end plate is produced at shocks
of 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4 V. However, there is no production of an e.p.p. at 2.0 V
(d) An action potential from a frog muscle produced by electrical
stimulation.
FIG. 5. Temporal summation of end plate potentials.
End plate potentials are produced at the indicated frequencies. Indirect
shocks consisted of 2.0 V. and were 0.4 msec. in duration.
FIG. 6. Block of the end plate potential with D-tubocurarine.
