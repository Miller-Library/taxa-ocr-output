sucked up into the electrode. However. even in this preparation, some of the
muscles did not appear responsive
It appears as if there are some standard occurences at the neuromuscular
junction of the sanddab. Indirect stimulation can be blocked to some extent

by curare, 11A, and omega conatoxin. Presumably this is because sanddabs
use ACh as their neurotransmitter, and their nerves have Na and Ca channels
which can be blocked by appropriate toxins.
However, some of the drugs appeared to take a long time to show an
effect. Perhaps there is a problem with chemical diffusion in this fish, so
that the endplates are extremely well insulated and perfect conditions are
necessary to chemically alter behavior. Repeated studies need to be
accomplished in order to understand the time course of the drugs used.
With repeated experiments, perhaps a pattern would develop which would
lead to greater insight. It would also be advantageous if the drugs were
more responsive to washing out, so that work could be reliably reproduced
on the same muscle.
It is not clear why the preparations produced in these experiments were
responsive to a single shock, while previous studies have needed to use
repetitive stimuli to shock indirectly (Gilly and Aladjem. 1987). Perhaps this
is caused by differences in the innervation patterns of fast twitch versus
intermediate twitch muscle fibers. It would be interesting to see if there
were significant differences between the neuromuscular junctions of the
different fiber types. The previous study accomplished work on the left side
of the fish, and there is the possibility that differences exist between the left
and right sides of the sanddab. Differences were also observed in the
summation of end plate potentials for probably the same reasons. Previous
work showed a large summation of e.p.p. and then a plateau depolarization.
