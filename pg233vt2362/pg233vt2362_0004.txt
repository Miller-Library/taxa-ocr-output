However, sanddabs are able to produce muscle excitation without producing
action potentials.
Since sanddabs do not appear to normally have sodium channels in their
muscle fibers, it would be interesting to see if they have the capabilities to
express them under appropriate conditions. Denervation of skeletal muscles
is well known to produce this effect (Keynes and Aidley, 1981). A severed
nerve will cause the muscle it supplies to dramatically change its
physiological properties. After a few days, the muscle will develop more
sodium channels and ACh receptors. Moreover, the whole muscle cell
surface becomes sensitive to ACh, which nor mally is effective just at the end
plates. It would be interesting to see if sanddabs possess the capablities to
produce these mor phological change:
The present study focuses on three aspects of neuromuscular
transmission. The first is to look at the the summation of e.p.p. in order to
produce muscle fiber contraction. The second is to gain a better
understanding of the phar macological aspects of the neuromuscular junction,
and finally, to look at the question of functional changes due to denervation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pacific Sand Dabs, Ctharicthys sordidus were caught with a hook and line
at Monterey Bay. California. They were maintained in a flow-through sea
water tank. They were killed with decapitation so that drugs or higher
motor control centers would not influence results. Dissections were carried
out to produce viable muscle and nerve preparations (see below and Figure
1). The preparations were maintained in Ringer solution and placed on a
cooling plate (see below). They were secured with pins to the Sylgard (Dow
