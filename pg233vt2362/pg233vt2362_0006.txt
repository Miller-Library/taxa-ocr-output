the end plate band (see figure 1). Contractile responses appeared to be
strong and fast in this region.
SOLUTIONS
Composition of the ringer used was (mmol 1-D): 200 Nacl, 3 KCI, 4MgCI2,
and 4 CaCl. This was buffered to pH 7.2 with SmM Tris. Ringer was kept
refrigerated and the experimental chamber was maintained at
approximately 20Â° C. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St.
Louis, Missouri). Omega-conotoxin and the paralytic peptide were obtained
from Dr. Baldomero Olivera, University of Utah.

ANATOMY AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION
PREPARATION
The pattern of the fin spine musculature of the sanddab is shown for the
left side in Figure 1. The pattern is repeated for every dorsal and anal fin
spine along the length of the animal on both left and right sides. The figure
demonstrates that each fin spine is connected to two muscles on the left side;
two identical muscles are present on the right as well. These muscles are
connected to bone shafts with a triangular head. These bone shafts are
connected to the proximal rib and to the fin spines with extensive connective
tissue. Also connected to each fin spine is a skin muscle (not illustrated)
which is connected in the middle of the fin spine and at a junction
approximately halfway up the bone shafts. The skin muscles run between
the two bone shafts and on top of the other two muscles. They were cut
away so that the motor nerves could be exposed. Skin muscles also exist on
the both sides of the fish, and the total is thus six muscles connected to each
fin spine.
