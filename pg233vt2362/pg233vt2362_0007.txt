In carrying out physiological studies of fin muscle, the skin muscles were
dissected off of both sides, and the preparations were carefully cleaned from
fin spine to proximal rib. Therefore, the preparations appeared as in Figure
1. except that the antagonistic muscles were also usually connected on the
other side. Although there appeared to be no differences between the two
sides of the fish, in order to maximize consistency of results, all preparations
were taken ventrally from the right side of the fish. Previous work had
employed left dorsal muscles.
Motor nerves are indicated in Fig. I as running along the course of a
proximal rib and between two triangular-headed bone shafts.
Approximately midway down the length of the bone shafts, the nerve
branches and turns to run laterally across the muscle surface. Stimulation
applied to the nerve in this area was effective, and it appears that endplates
lie in this middle portion of the muscles (see below). A large nerve
pr√©sumably sensory in function, branches off the main nerve as shown in
Fig. I, and runs between the skin muscles and courses down the length of
the lin spine through its hollow interior. The nerves run in parallel down
every spine on both left and right sides of the fish, but are physically
seperated from one another, even the spine itself,
One difficulty in producing good preparations is the large amount of
connective tissue in the area used for stimulation (end plate band). There is
also extensive connective tissue which forms part of the proximal
termination of the skin muscles in this region. It was difficult to obtain a
clean preparation without damaging the muscle fibers or nerves in this area;
however, this procedure was necessary since a cleaner preparation was more
readily excitable and was also suitable for intracellualr recording. It was
