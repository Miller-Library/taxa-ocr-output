an action potential is ever observed. The electrical signs of muscle activation
in sanddab muscle differ markedly from more 'typical' vertebrate skeletal
muscle. As a comparison, the action potential recorded intracellularly from
tadpole myotome muscle is shown in Fig. 4d.
Figure 5 shows some additional properties of the e.p.p. in fish. Even with
repetitive stimulation, no action potential is formed. The e.p.p. depicted in
Figure 4 were all produced in response to single shocks, which also produced
brisk muscle twitches. This result differs from those in previously published
work (Gilly and Aladjem, 1987). According to this paper, trains of stimuli
were necessary to indirectly excite muscle. Also, figure 5 does not show the
same pattern of summation of junction potentials to a plateau depolarization
that was documented in the aforementioned paper (see Discussion).
PHARMACOLOGY OE NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION
Once it was clear that the contraction was accomplished through indirect
stimulation, it was possible to attempt some phar macological experiments
Figure 6 documents the block of the e.p.p. with 100 uM curare. This was
accomplished in the course of three minutes. Since curare blocks ACh
receptors, it is reasonable to assume that sanddabs use ACh as their
neurotransmitter for motor neurons. This is supported by the fact that a
strong contracture is produced when carbochol, an ACh analog, is added to
the preparation.
TTX is a toxin that blocks Na channels. Figure 7a shows the result of
adding TTX to a muscle being stimulated indirectly with single shocks. Force
is completely eliminated in 8 minutes (Fig. 7b). Presumably, conduction of
the nerveâ€™s Na channels are blocked so that electrical excitation of the nerve
is stopped and no ACh can be released at the neuromuscular junction. TTX
was effective at concentrations of 200 nM, although its time course ranged
