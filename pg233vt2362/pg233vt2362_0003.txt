rates that are neither fast nor tonic (less than 1 second). The sanddab must
rely on multiple innervation and summation of end plate potentials in order
to control contractions of its fin muscle; this is accomplished through
depolarizations along the entire course of its fibers. This makes the sanddab
an intriguing experimental system. It would be interesting to understand
more about this system and its relations to systems in other animals.
Neuromuscular transmission has been extensively studied in amphibia
and higher vertebrates, but work on fish is limited. At the end plate a motor
axon makes contact with a muscle fiber, and a synapse exists between the
two cellular elements. When an action potential in the axon invades the
synaptic ter minals, neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) is secreted and quickly
binds to receptors in the muscle cell. These receptors are cation-selective
channels which open upon binding to ACh. Fatt and Katz (1951) first
recorded end plate potentials (e.p.p.) in frog muscle by recording
intracellularly from muscle fibers during indirect stimulation of the motor
nerve. They found that one could reduce the size of the e.p.p. by adding
curare to the preparation. This drug binds to the postsynaptic ACh receptor
molecules. It was later established by Del Castillo and Katz (1954) that the
e.p.p. was produced by a nuber of small quantal components. Further work
was done by Martin in 1955 in which he described end plate potentials as
the summation of many miniature potentials. It is now understood that
these miniature e.p.p. are all-or-none. and therefore, correspond to packets
of ACh being released either spontaneously or in response to nerve
stimulation. In a frog muscle fiber, a single e.p.p. due to one action potential
in the motor axon causes summation of many miniature e.p.p. and generally
leads to the production of an all-or-none action potential in the muscle cell.
