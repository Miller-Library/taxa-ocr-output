and had lost their elasticity. Some of the experimental muscles had begun to
take on this appearance also, but others which had clearly been denervated
still appeared healthy and responded to direct muscle stimulation with
repetitve shocks (not illustrated). Muscles on the left side of the fish
maintained their normal appearance. It was anticipated that the denervated
muscles would develop Na channels. This, along with increased sensitivity to
ACh, has been documented in other animals. Unfortunately, any increase in
muscle excitability was not detectable in this preliminary experiment.
Perhaps more time is needed for these changes to develop or finer recording
techniques may be necessary (e.g. intracellular recording).
DISCUSSION
Despite its relatively simple and highly repetitive anatomical layout, the
sanddab is a rather difficult animal to study. The muscles and nerves
appear to be rather fragile, and one must take great care during dissections
so as not to damage the preparation. The muscles might also be easily
damaged by stretching since there clearly is a maximal stretch which can be
applied to the fin muscles. The sanddab's force vs. length curve (Fig. 2) is
extremely more dramatic than other animals. Most animals show a slow loss
of force after a maximal stretch due to the loss of overlap between the actin
and myosin filaments (Keynes and Aidley. 1981). The sharp loss of force in
the sanddab is a mystery. Perhaps multiply innervated systems are much
more responsive to stretch and endplates are more easily disrupted.
It appears that work might be easier to accomplish on the extraocular
muscles. These muscles can be easily dissected out with a large intact nerve
attached. In this system, stimulation could be accomplished with a cut nerve
