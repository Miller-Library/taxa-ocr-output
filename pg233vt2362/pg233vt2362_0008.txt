also important to visually observe the muscle contractions and have an
unobstructed contact between the nerve and the electrode.
Several other difficulties were experienced in trying to produce viable
preparations. Results are probably dependent on the fiber type being
stimulated. Contractions were not reliably produced in the same area of the
muscle fiber every time. Differences might be representitive of stimulating
different fibers. Since the sanddab has three different muscle fiber types, it
is important to stimulate the same fiber groups every time in order to
control for variation, especially when measuring force from the whole
muscle. Different regions of contractions could be representitive of different
muscle fibers. The nerves also appeared to be extremely fragile, so that
sucking a cut end of a nerve up into the electrode appeared to damage its
conductive properties. This was allieviated by gently placing the electrode
on the nerve (en passant) and applying a gentle suction. This technique is
effective in producing indirect stimulation, but care must be exerted to avoid
direct muscle stimulation in the immediate area of the electrode tip.
Because of the difficulties associated with the fin muscle, an alternative
preparation was sought. Extraocular muscle was found to be an excellent
preparation, and it could be isolated with intact innervation. The preparation
consisted of the superior oblique extraocular muscle and its intact
innervation. The nerve could be sucked up into the electrode without
apparent damage, and produce reliable contractions with repetitive
stimulation.
CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIRECT STIMULATION
Indirect stimulation of fin muscle was carried out using single shocks, and
the resulting contractile force was measured. We routinely found that the
resting length of the muscle greatly influences contractile strength (see
