Figure 5 shows a lack of dramatic facilitation, so that there is not a
considerable amount of summation to a plateau. The first e.p.p. is also much
larger in comparison to the second than those seen in the earlier study. This
could explain why a single shock was a sufficient stimulus to produce
muscular contraction in our present experiments.
This paper is the first de monstration of the physiological effect of GVIA
omega-conotoxin in fish. This is rather ironic since the snails are fish killing
animals. Nevertheless, the toxin appears to block the neuromuscular
junction of fish as expected. The paralytic peptide appeared to have no
effect on peripheral nerve transmission or end plate transmisssion.
However, it has been shown to have a paralytic effect when injected into an
intact fish (Kuo, E., 1989). This implies that its effects are restricted to
higher motor centers.
The sanddab appears to be an intriguing experimental system. Two large
sensory nerves can be seen supplying each fin spine. Presumably, these
nerves are sensory in function. They might be linked to proprioception or
substrate identification. The innervation of the skin muscle may also help to
shed some light on the interesting muscles of the sanddab. The sanddab
appears to have developed a complex system in order to finely orchestrate
its movement. A more detailed characterization of this neuromuscular
system should be interesting.
