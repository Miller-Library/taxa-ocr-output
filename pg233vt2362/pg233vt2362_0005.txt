Corning. Midland, Michigan) floor of an experimental chamber. The fin
spines were tied with thread and connected to a force transducer which was
supported by a micromanipulator.
The main nerves and trunks running along the proximal ribs branch out
less dramatically in more anterior regions of the fish. Results in this report
are all obtained from the posterior end of the fish. Smaller fish were
pr√©ferred because they possess significantly less connective tissue in the
experimental region.
FORCE MEASUREMENTS
Contractile responses to indirect stimulation (via nerve) were studied.
Motor nerves were stimulated with a polished glass suction electrode
(approximately 250 um in diameter) which was supported by a
micromanipulator. The electrode was gently placed against the nerve and a
slight suction was applied. The same technique was also used to directly
stimulate muscle fibers. Spurious stimulation of tissue away from the
pipette tip by the indifferent wire outside of the glass electrode was avoided
by placing the wire as far away from the muscle as possible, but still in the
experimental chamber. Force was then measured with a transducer made
from Pixie semiconductor elememts (Endevco, Pasedena, California; Gilly and
Hui. 1980). Recordings were made on both a chart recorder and an
oscilloscope.
INTRACELLULAR RECORDINC
In order to record voltage differences from muscle fibers, electrodes were
filled with 3M KCI. Electrodes were 10-20 x 106 Ohms in resistance. They
were carefully manipulated until they were near a muscle fiber, and then.
upon a swift tap to the micromanipulator, they punctured the cell.
Recordings were made from fin-muscle fibers only on the fin spine side of
