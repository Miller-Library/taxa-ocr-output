ABSTRACT
The neuromuscular junction of Pacific Sanddabs was studied. Neither
fast nor slow muscle fibers in the fin muscles of sanddabs produce action
potentials. Muscle activation by indirect stimulation could be inhibited with
TTI
D-tubocurarine (curare), tetrodotoxin (11X), and GVIA omega-conotoxin.
This indicated some similarities in the neuromuscular system of sanddabs
compared to other vertebrates. Motor nerve and synaptic transmission are
sensitive to sodium and calcium channel blocks, and acetylcholine is likely to
be the neurotransmitter, as suggested by the curare sensitivity of
neuromuscular transmission. However, direct stimulation of muscle fibers
could be continued after the neuromuscular transmission had been blocked.
Although they do not produce action potentials, the muscles do produce end
plate potentials. A single end plate potential has proved adequate to
produce a muscle twitch.
INTRODUCTION
Pacific Sandabs are interesting animals because they have fast twitch
muscle fibers that do not generate action potentials, presumably, because
they lack voltage-sensitive sodium channels (Gilly and Aladjem, 1987). This
is a rare occurence in vertebrate skeletal muscle systems. Sanddabs also
possess tonic fibers which hold contractions for extended periods of time
(i.e. minutes). These fibers do not produce action potentials either. Other
vertebrates use tonic fibers to control a wide range of specialized behaviors
Instead of using action potentials, the tonic system is activated through
several axons contacting the muscle fiber at multiple sites along its length.
This produces localized depolarizations and enables graded force
development. The sanddab also has intermediate fibers which contract at
