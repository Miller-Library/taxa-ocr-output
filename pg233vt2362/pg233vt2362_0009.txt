Figure 2). Over a small change in length (slack length- 1 cm), the muscle
displays a large change in contractile strength. Force increases smoothly up
to a 10x stretch beyond slack length, where the maximal contractile force is
reached. A slight additional stretch (0.2 mm) causes a sharp drop in
contractile force. All experiments were carried out near the maximum of the
length-force curve which was determined for each preparation.
When a nerve is excited, its axons fire in an all or none manner. As
shown in figure 3a, extraocular muscle is indirectly excited to a maximal
contractile strength over a very small range of applied voltages. The region
of gradation in force probably reflects increasing excitation of more motor
axons in the nerve over this range of stimulating voltages. This
characteristic of a gradable response of the whole muscle is expected for
indirect stimulation. Apparently, all of the motor axons in the oculomotoi
nerve, which has been sucked up onto the stimulating electrode, can be
uniformly excited at a shock of less than 1 volt.
The fin spine muscles showed a much more gradable force response with
shock strength (Fig. 3b), at least using single shock stimuli. A major
difference between the two preparations is that the fin spine motor nerve
has an extremely large amount of connective tissue around the stimulating
region. Because the en passant configuration of nerve stimulation was used
with fin spine preparations, it may have been impossible to equally excite
the whole nerve, except with very strong shocks. Since the nerve was not
cut and sucked up into the electrode, there is also the possibility of directly
exciting muscle fibers with large shocks.
The gradation of force with indirect stimulation of fin spine muscle is
largely different from that seen with direct muscle stimulation. Direct
stimulation shows that contractile strength is even more graded with voltage
