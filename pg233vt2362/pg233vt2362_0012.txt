over à number of minutes. Because TTX blocks Na channels, it blocks direct
muscle excitation in muscles with action potentials, e.g. tadpoles (not
illustrated). However, sanddabs apparently do not have muscle Na channels
and therefore, direct stimulation is still possible after indirect stimulation
had been completely blocked by TTX. These phar macological results
reinforce what is already known about sanddab muscle.
The extraocular muscle preparation was used for further phar macological
studies. These results are summarized in Figure 8. Stimulation was not done
with à single shock, but rather with tetani of 200 Hz. for 0.5 sec. The shocks
were at 0.5 V. and lasted for 0.4 msec. It appears as if 0.6 mM of the
paralytic peptide (an uncharacterized conotoxin: obtained through personal
communication with B. Olivera) had no effect. Either higher dosages or more
time would be needed to document any effect this drug had. The next drug
applied was 0.3 mM of GVIA omega-conotoxin. This drug blocks presynaptic
calcium channels in frog neuromuscular junctions (Olivera et al. 1985), and
therefore, blocks the release of ACh from the presynaptic terminal. This
appeared to have an inhibitory effect in the present experiment. Finally, as
controls, curare and TTX were used to induce comlpete loss of response,
DENERYATION
As à final experiment, it was attempted to denervate sanddab fin muscle
A cut was made proximaf to the skin muscles. The incision was made
laterally along one half of the fish on the right side. The muscle was pulled
back to expose the main motor nerves diagrammed in Fig. 1. Several motor
nerves on the right ventral side were cut proximal to the end plate band
area nor mally used for stimulation. The fish were then allowed to recover
for at least four days. After four days, one fish was dissected. Due to the
operation, the damaged skin muscles appeared extremely white, tore easily
