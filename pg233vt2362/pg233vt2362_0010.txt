applied than the results shown in Fig. 3b. (Gilly and Aladjem. 1987.) Force
elicited by direct muscle activation is also highly responsive to changes in
the stimulus duration over a range that does not affect indirect stimulation
(e.g. changing from 0.5 to 5 ms shocks. Data not illustrated). Direct
stimulation is also not very responsive (if at all) to reverse polarity of the
stimulus (i.e. inside of pipette positive), presumably because sanddab muscle
does not have sodium channels. Nerves can be stimulated by this anodeÂ¬
break method, because the hyperpolarizing stimulus will induce Na channels
to activate upon termination of the hyperpolarization and return of the
membrane potential to its normal value. A final difference is that direct
stimulation always produces visually detectable contractions im mediately in
the region stimulated, whereas indirect stimulation often produces
contractions far away from the stimulating site, e.g. from several groups of
muscles.
PRODUCTION OF AN END PLATE POTENTIAL AT THE NEUROMUSCULAR
JUNCTION
Intracellular recording revealed that an end plate potential (e.p.p.) is
produced in response to indirect stimulation. This is shown in Figure 4a.
The rise after the e.p.p. is due to the muscle twitch dislodging the
microelectrode. As the electrode is moved closer to the end plate band
described above, (in another muscle fiber), the e.p.p. becomes larger and
faster and occurs at a shorter delay (Fig. 4b). Hence, the electrode has been
moved closer to the endplate.
Although the e.p.p. appears to be all or none, this arises from the all or
none firing of the motor axon and not from the excitability of the muscle cell.
Fig. 4c shows that the same e.p.p. is produced with shocks of 2.1. 2.2, and 2.3
V. However, a shock of 2.0 V. produced no e.p.p. at all. Nothing resembling
