Adults of the limpet Acmaea asmi (Middendorff, 1849)
live as commensals on the shells of the intertidal
gastropod Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854). The larvae,
however, pass through a pelagic phase; the longer they
remain pelagid the greater the chance they will be carried
away from the shore and hence away from the host population.
The densest adult populations of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. asmi</span> occur in relatively
/12-7 Hdtd donel
high, and somewhat isolated pools, where neither wave
action nor surge will as easily carry larvae away from
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. funebralis</span> (Eikenberry and Wickizer, 1964). Legie
suggests the possibittty oromparativelg beief o
swimming period and a tendency of the larvae to settle
ogresiblyy and
directly on the shells of T. funebralis, I therefore
attempted to follow larval development and to determine
if this were the case.

Spawning of Adults and Rearing of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Larvae : Exact'>Larvae</span>
All larvae used for embryological work were obtained

by natural spawning in the laboratory during the period
from April 13 to May 24, 1963. A. asmi were removed
ga
from T. funebralis collected on rocks by-the Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. They were
placed in 5-inch finger bowls of filtered sea water,
changed daily, and kept at 14°0. A. asmi removed
from their hosts immediately began to clump together
and to climb up one another's shells. Eggs and sperm
are shed fee inthe water. The males generally spawn
first, although isolated females did spawn occasionally.
Various stimuli were tried to elicit spawning. The
most successful was light shock. Bowls containing several
A. asmi each were completely covered with inverted black
dishes at night so that light was excluded. Between
8 a.m. and 10 a.m. the following morning, the dishes
were removed and on eight occasions one or more animals
spawned immediately or within an hour. In uncovered
dishes exposed to normal diurnal light conditions animals
generally spawned at dawn if at all. Although light fol-
lowing a period of darkness appears to elicit spawning,
A. asmi will sometimes spawn without it, for twice A.
asmi spawned while in the dark.
Although larvae were raised in bowls at a constant
208
D.E. Wickizer
temperature (some at 10°6, some at 12°0, some at 14°0 )
and filtered sea water was changed daily, larvae began
to die at 48 hours.
Attempts were made to prolong life beyond two days
by providing food including filamentous diatoms ground
in a Waring blendor, diatoms from a high tide pool,
and pure cultures of both <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Platymonas : Exact'>Platymonas</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Stichococcus : Exact'>Stichococcus.</span>

Although larvae were noted ta Stichococcus, the
food did not increase larval life span. Aeration of
the water likewise appeared to have no beneficial
affects.
The larvae began dying shortly after torsion. Between
45 and 60 hours the larval vel detached and the larvae
disintegrated. Ciliate protozoa were nearly always found
in the shells of these animals. The only larvae which lived
for as long as 6-7 days were those in three bowls raised
at 12°0, without a daily change of water.
Larval Development

during larval development and figures 2-6 illustrate
selected stages.

0.126-0.130 mm in diameter. A clear fertilization mem-
brane is formed. Cleavage follows the gastropod spiral
pattern. To the 4-cell stage, the blastomeres are equal;
at 8-cells micromeres are differentiated. Other details
observed conform generally to the findings of Boutan
Virgign
(1899) on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea : Exact'>Acmaea</span>
Phase II—Trochophore. The prototroch, consisting
of a ring of large cells bearing a single girdle of
cilia actively rotates the larvae which at first
remain near the bottom. Shorter cilia cover the surface
anterior to the prototroch. The apical tuft bears two
long flagella measuring approximatelyO.12 mm in length
which appear to have a sensory function, as the larvae
back off whenever these touch a surface. Similar
structures were noted in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Patella vulgata : Exact'>Patella vulgata</span> by F.G.W. Smith
(1935). The trochophore is very yolky, and no internal
organization could be seen.
Phase III—-Pre-torsional Veliger. Modifications at
this stage include the evagination of the shell gland,
development of the foot rudiment and expansion of the
velum. The apical tuft with its sensory flagella
remains. Longer cilia develop on the sides of the
velum. By 33 hours the velum has become a double row of
cells with two sets of cilia alternately placed. Two

eye spots develop subapically.
Veliger larvae are free swimming throughout this
period, but become negatively phototactic at about 18
hours and tend to remain on the bottoms of bowls for brief
periods from this point on.
Phase IV—Torsion and Post-Torsional Larvae. The
muscular phase of torsion begins between 30 and 35 hours
and is relatively rapid. Boutan (1899) states that in Acmaea
Viaginte
t the process takes only 2-3 minutes. The shell
and visceral hump rotate well over 90 degrees with
reference to the head and foot, allowing the animal to
retract its head partly into the mantle cavity. The
long apical flagella are lost at this time. The remaining
phase of torsion takes place gradually, but by 55-60 hours
torsion appears completed, and the head and velum can be
withdrawn completely into the shell. Other changes occurring
during late torsion or immediately thereafter include
enlargement of the foot and further development of the
operculum, development of additional muscles, thickening
of the mantle edge, and differentiation of the gut. The
larval shell at this stage is an unusual structure with two
small lateral flanges projecting medially from the lateral
margins of the shell just inside the aperture.
Metamorphosis and settling possibly occur between 6
and 7 days after fertilization. As stated, in a few
cases whole animals still with velum intact were observed

at 6-7 days. These animals appeared to be shelless; yet
no shells were observed in any of the bowls. Perhaps
reabsorption of the shell occurs.
When an adult T. funebralis was placed with these larvae
a definite attraction towards it was noted, and several
larvae began to swim over the surface of the animal, appearing
to settle there. An opportunity to repeat the observations
was not available.
Summary
1. Eggs and sperm are shed into the water, and spawning
seems to be stimulated by exposure to light following
darkness.
2. The larvae develop rapidly; torsion begins between
30 and 35 hours and is completed by 55-60 hours.
3. A. asmi larvae appear to be attracted to T. funebralis
at 6-7 days and probably settle about this time.
