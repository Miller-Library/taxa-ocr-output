Results
Results from the analyses of three inshore and two
offshore tows are presented in Table I and Figure I. The
Vellela lata sample examined was taken from samples collected
about 100 miles off the Oregon coast during a cruise of the
R/V proteus in October, 1970. Highlights of the results follow.
1. The calanoid copepod samples collected at the surface
had higher concentrations of Ag, Zn, Pb (p =.20; see Table
II), and Cr (p = .10) than samples collected at 10 meters
depth, while Cd concentration was higher in the plankton (p -.10).
2. Offshore plankton copepods had over twice the Pb concen-
tration (10.37 Â£ 1.61 ppm vs. 1.28 - 1.12 ppm; see Table I)
as that found in the inshore plankton copepod samples (p =.01).
3. Euphausia pacifica samples at the surface and at 10 m.
showed no significant difference (all p values greater than
20) in heavy metal concentration except for Pb, for which
the plankton samples had about twice the neuston Pb concen-
tration (5.39 I .56 vs. 2.15 -.32, p -.05).
1. There was no significant difference measured for any
heavy metal concentration between neuston and plankton
samples of Pleurobrachia bachii (all p values greater than.30).
5. As the relative density of copepods in the surface zone
decreased in a series of runs, a corresponding increase in
