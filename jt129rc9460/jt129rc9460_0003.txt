Introduction
Because of the unique properties of the air-sea interface,
it is surprising to find a paucity of information concerning
the biology of this zone. It has been stated that chemical
reactions in the ocean are "largely determined by phenomena
which occur at interfaces" (Horne, 1969), and that almost all
physical, chemical, and biological processes in the ocean
depend on the ocean having a free boundary with the air
(Wellander, 1961).
Study of the air-sea interface would probably provide a
good deal of information concerning the movement of heavy metals
in the ocean. There is now good evidence that a significant
portion of lead now entering the ocean does so via the atmos-
phere; automobile exhaust has been found to contribute greatly
to atmospheric lead pollution (Patterson, 1965, 1970; State
of Cal. Air Resources Board, 1967; Mauchline and Templeton, 1964;
Tatsumoto and Patterson, 1963). The interface is in constant
exposure to such atmospheric fallout. Moreover, the physical
and biological properties of the surface are such that materials
are either concentrated or dispersed there. Materials in the
surface layer are either heavier or lighter than sea water
(Wilson, 1959); materials that are lighter float to the surface
while heavier particles sink to deeper levels. Organisms
facilitate both of these processes. They carry materials to
the surface during their diurnal and seasonal migrations.
