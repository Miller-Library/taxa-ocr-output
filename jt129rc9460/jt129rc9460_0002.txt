Abstract
Plankton samples from the surface and from 10 meters
depth were collected in Monterey Bay and analyzed for Ag,
Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn, Cd, and Pb. The results showed a trend
toward higher concentration at the air-sea interface.
Possible mechanisms of concentration processes are discussed,
with some consideration given to the ecological implications.
