metal concentration. This is not surprising. P. bachii
is capable of strong and rapid vertical migrations; they
will move down when surface conditions are rough, and also
when light intensity is high (Hyman, 1940). Also, because
their surface area to volume ratio is minimal, P. bachii
does not concentrate high levels of heavy metals by surface
adsorption. Therefore, if differences between surface and
subsurface samples do exist, they are more difficult to
observe.
It is reasonable to expect an inverse relationship
between plankton vs. neuston density for the copepod samples
because copepods exhibit vertical migrations. The results
presented in Figure II indicate that both the neuston and
plankton samples were at least partly composed of a vertically
migrating population. But it is likely that some organisms
spend most of their time at the surface, while other organisms
seldomly leave the subsurface zone, because copepods were
always found in both zones during simultaneous tows at the
surface and 10 m. Copepods collected at the surface when
relative density was low are probably those organisms having
a long residence time on the surface. Similarly, samples
collected at 10 m. during low density conditions contained
those copepods that rarely migrate to the surface. The
existence of either of these populations is masked when density
is high.
This is the type of subdivision one might expect within
