Materials and Methods
Basic means of collection were a neuston sled towed
at the surface (David, 1965) anddsmall zooplankton net
simultaneously towed about 10 meters below the surface.
The two nets had openings of similar are (0.0h6 m for
the sled, 0.061 m for the plankton net) and similar
mesh (220.5 microns for the sled, 291 microns for net).
The sled was either towed off to the side of the
boat by means of a boom, or was trailed far enough aft
so that the wake had little effect. Tows lasted from
one-half hour to one hour. All inshore tows were taken
between 7:00 A.M. and 10:00 A.M. Boat speed was recorded
and used in the calculations of relative biomass density.
While on board, the fresh samples were taken from the
net and placed in acid-cleaned (1-6 N HNO,) glassware,
covered with aluminum foil, and stored on ice.
In the lab, major groups of organisms were separated.
This usually consisted of separating calanoid copepods
from P. bachii and medusae (especially Octatina sp.).
This was easily done by passing the sample through a
coarse (0.5 cm. mesh) net. The remaining sample was
strained through a ring of phytoplankton netting, retaining
the copepod segment of the sample. Excess water was removed
and wet weights recorded. All samples were dried at 80Â°0
for at least 21 hours.
