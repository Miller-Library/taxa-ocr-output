Discussion
Results of this study do not show with certainty a
process of heavy metal concentration at the air-sea interface.
The probable reason for this is that the organisms sampled
were members of a vertically migrating population rather
than members of distinct neuston and plankton communities.
Despite this, however, there was a trend toward higher
concentrations in the surface copepod samples over those
samples collected at 10 m. This strongly suggests that
some heavy metals are concentrated at the interface. It
is interesting that this trend is in the opposite direction
to that found by Martin (1970), who reported higher heavy
metal concentrations in copepod sampled at depths greater
than 100 m. than in samples from surface waters. This
apparent disparity may be related to the depth of sampling.
The purpose of this study was to was to analyze movements of
heavy metals at the air-sea interface and immediate underlying
waters, while Martin was looking at larger scale movements.
His "surface water" sampling zone included both zone sampled
in this study. Despite this, there is fairly good agreement
between values reported here and those given by Martin (Table Il1
Additional evidence for the phenomena of surface concenÂ¬
tration comes from the results of Baxter (1971) on these
same copepod samples for analysis of DDT. He noted that
the surface samples had a greater concentration of DDT than
did the plankton samples. Also, Marion (1971) reported that
