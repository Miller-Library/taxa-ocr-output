the DDT concentrations in Hermissinda crassicornis collected
from floats were 2.3 times higher than those collected pilings,
0.5 to 7 m. below the surface.
Offshore planktonic copepods had significantly more
Pb than the inshore planktonic copepods, for reasons as yet
unknown.
An anomalous set of data resulted from analysis of the
Euphausia pacifica samples collected during tow 15. For
six of the metals analyzed there was no significant differ-
ence between the surface samples and those collected at 10 m.
Moreover, Baxter (1971) found that the two samples had the
same DDT concentrations. This homogeneity for E. pacifica
might be expected because this organism is a strong vertical
migrator, and may move from a depth of several hundred meters
up to the surface. However, the 10 m. samples contained
about twice the Pb concentration of the surface samples.
Physiological differences between the populations are not
considered likely because they would tend to produce more
than a difference in the concentrati on of just one metal.
It is quite possible that, because only two samples were
analyzed, and that the concentrations of Pb measured were
at the limit of sensitivity for measurement by atomic absorp-
tion, the statistical test for this particular case was not
valid.
The neuston and plankton samples of Pleurobrachia bachii
showed no significant differences with respect to heavy
