at the surface of Monterey Bay as compared to organisms
collected at a depth of about 10 meters. Several different
kinds of organisms were sampled and analyzed (calanoid
copepods, the euphausid Euphausia pacifica, the ctenaphore
Pleurobrachia bachii, and the siphonophore Velella lata);
surface samples were designated as neuston, and subsurface
samples labelled plankton.
