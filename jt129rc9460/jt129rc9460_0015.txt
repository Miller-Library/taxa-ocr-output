Conclusion
The results presented here favor the hypothesis that certain
heavy metals are concentrated at the air-sea interface relative
to concentrations found in underlying waters. Problems encountered
in sampling, analysis, and population structure of the plankton
tended to mask these differences.
The implications from this surface concentration effect may
be significant. It is likely that organism feeding on this surface
layer, such as larval fish and birds like skimmers and phalaropes,
may be receiving a relatively high metal load in their food.
Metals concentrated at the surface may feed directly into both
aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Also, because of the chemical
reactions that place at the surface, the concentration effect at
the interface may play an important role in the biogeochemical
cycling of these elements.
