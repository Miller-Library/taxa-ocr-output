The relationships for Cd concentration vs. density Fiqve lLb)
are especially interesting. In the plankton samples,
concentration increases as density decreases; that is,
concentration increases as residence time increases. The
opposite is true for neuston copepods; concentration increases
as density increases. This type of relationship might occur
if Cd is in higher concentration in subsurface waters than
at the surface. Organisms that remain at depth for a longer
period of time would tend to concentrate the metal through
adsorption and feeding. Also, as copepods that have spent
some time in the subsurface waters migrate to the surface,
they carry with them relatively high Od loads. So concentra-
tion of Od in neuston increases while density also increases.
It is interesting to note that Cd is the only metal tested
that showed a higher concentration in the subsurface samples.
Zn and Pb concentrations in neuston copepods show the
same type of relationship demonstrated by Od in the plankton.
There are no corresponding relationships in the subsurface
samples for these metals, however. The probable reason for
this lack of correspondence is that the downwardly migrating
copepods diffuse throughout several meters of the subsurface
waters so that there is no clear gradient. These results do
support the hypothesis that at least Zn and Pb are concentrated
at the air-sea interface.
