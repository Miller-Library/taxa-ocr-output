a large population; while the majority of organisms will
show an average amount of migration, some individuals will
be skewed on either the high or low side of the mean distance
and frequency of migration. There is evidence for some of
the differences occurring between individuals in a copepod
population. It has been noted that female copepods come to
the surface to lay eggs, and also that females migrate more
regularly than males (Marshall and Orr, 1955). Bainbridge
(1952, in Marshall and Orr) observed that some copepods may
inhabit only the top 30 cm. of water, while others seldoml
migrate that close to the surface.
It is reasonable to suspect that some copepods spend
much of their time at the surface, while others more exclusively
inhabit the subsurface zone. If there is a difference in
metal concentration between the surface and subsurface,
those organisms that spend the greatest amounts of time at
each zone should exhibit those differences most clearly.
There is good evidence that this is true. Relative density
is inversely related to time; a low density value gives
some measure of the length of time certain organisms spent
in one zone. Figure IIIdemonstrates some relationships
between metal concentration and residence time, as measured
by relative density. From these relationships one can gain
some knowledge as to the depths at which various metals are
concentrated.
