Aliquots of the dried samples (less than l gm dry
weight) were placed in acid-cleaned beakers and dissolved
in concentrated HNO, (70-90%). Organic matter was destroyed
using a modification of a method described by Middleton
and Stuckey (in Christian and Feldman, 1970). The modified
method consisted essentially of heating the sample with
concentrated HNO,, evaporating the solution to dryness,
redissolving the ash in acid, then adding a few ml of
HoO, (30%) to oxidize any remaining organic material. A
blank was included for each set of samples as a check for
reagent contamination.
After the sample was totally mineralized, the remaining
ash was dissolved in concentrated HNO, and diluted to a
standard volume with distilled H.0. The samples were then
analyzed for Ag, Zn, Cr, Cu, Mn, Cd, and Pb on an atomic
absorption spectrophotometer (model 303, Perkin-Elmer).
