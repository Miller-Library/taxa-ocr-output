(Kuenzler, 1969 a,b). Also, small bubbles such as those
produced by plants during conditions of high photosynthesis,
and more importantly those produced by wave action, carry
organic matter to the surface through a process of adsorption
onto the surface of these bubbles. This process results in
the formation of surface organic slicks(Riley, 1963; Riley,
et.al, 1964; Siegel and Burke, 1965; Wilson, 1959; Blanchard,
1964; and Baylor and Sutcliffe, 1963). Materials move down-
ward, again via plankton migrations, and also by elimination
of waste products and detrital matter (Fowler and Small, 1967;
Kuenzler, 1969 a,b; Martin, 1970; and Osterberg, et.al., 1963).
It is likely that organisms living at or migrating to the surface
of the ocean are important in both the concentration of heavy
metals at the surface and transport to the ocean floor as a
phase of the biogeochemical cycling of the various elements.
Also, because heavy metalss are generally surfaceÂ¬
active materials, and the surface of the ocean is a natural
area where these types of materials accumulate (Blanchard,
1964; Baylor and Sutcliffe, 1963; Riley, 1963; Riley, et.
al., 1964; Siegel and Burke, 1965; and Wilson, 1959), it
is reasonable to suspect that heavy metals may be concen-
trated at the surface of the ocean, relative to amounts
found in the underlying water.
The purpose of this study is to compare the concentrations
