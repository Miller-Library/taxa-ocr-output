C
plankton density was recorded (see Figure II).
6. There is an inverse correspondence between Od concen-
tration and relative biomass density in plankton copepods.
and a positive correlation between density and Cd concen-
tration in neuston copepods. Also, there are inverse
correlations for Pb and Zn vs. density in neuston copepods.
