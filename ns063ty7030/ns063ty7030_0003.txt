recovery. Initially, 96 groups of approximately 160 animals per group were placed
in 16X150 mm test tubes containing 20 ml of fresh sea water and the entire unit was
placed in a constant temperature bath at 20 C. The animals were maintained for 2
days in this condition before initiation of acclimation. To begin acclimation half
of the tubes in the 20 C bath were transferred to a 30 C constant temperature bath.
After 12 hours of acclimation, these animals were transferred back into the 20 C bath
and then tested at intervals of 0, 12, and 48 hours for loss of resistance to heat
acquired while at 30 C. Testing consisted of administering various thermal "dosages
to the animals and assaying for survival rate. These "dosages" consisted of exposure
to a 37 C water bath for times ranging from 18 to 40 minutes. One tube was used to
monitor each dosage, i.e., 12 in all. The populations in each tube were split into
2 groups before testing. Dosages were controlled by removing tubes at two minute
intervals from the 37 C bath and pouring the contents into a petri dish filled with
fresh seawater at 13 C. From the percent effect of these dosages an LT was calculated
first by the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (Litchfield and Wilcoxon 1949) and
then more exactly by the use of linear regression analysis after conversion of percents
to probits. This was accomplished with the use of two H-P 65 programs. The LTg was
used to compare different groups in terms of there heat resistance. The animals were
assayed for survival 5 - 7 hours after this heat stress. Survival was defined as
responsiveness to physical stimulation with a pipet. The assay time of between 5 and
7 hours was determined by making repetitive measurements for survival at 2,4, and
10 hours after heat stress. From graph il we can see that the 4 to 10 hour period
appears to be a plateau, i.e., no further recovery is taking place. A more detailed
analysis of recovery from heat torpor was done later with 0,7,11,16,24 and 48 hour
periods being assayed. In this case the time course of recovery from torpor was
