is also easily contained within this model.
In dealing with recovery from torpor it is most interesting to examine the
nature of the two dosage response curves produced by torpor and death respectively.
The torpor response is more dramatic and temperature sensitive than the heat death
response. For torpor a change in dosage of two minutes produces an approximate 707
change in animals scored as "surviving", while that same change in dosage produces
an approximate 302 change in the heat death response. The truncated nature of the
torpor response seems to implicate either very high "toxicity" of temperature or
alternatively, that a behavioral rather than a physiologic mechanism is being tapped
here. Considering the smooth signoid nature of the death response curve it seems more
logical to conceptualize torpor as a sensory response rather than an environmentally
imposed phsiologic response. This is consistant with the view of torpor as an
adaptive response to stress conditions. In this sense Tigriopus Califoricus chooses
to go into heat torpor while death is imposed upon it.
Summary
1) The loss of heat resistance in T. Californicus occurs rapidly within the
first 3 hours after removal from a high temperature condition.
2) In light of studies by Kontogiannis 1973 the acquisition and loss of heat
resistance appears symetrical in relation to time course.
3) The mechanisms involved in torpor and thermal death are different.
