recovery. This not the result. Secondly, if one plots the thermal dosages vs.
percent "survival",i.e,, percent responsive to tactile stimulation, after half an
hour of recovery time and then again at 24 hours of recovery time, we see very
different responses to temperature stress. This can be seen in graph #5. Response
I is the torpor response and 2 the death response. Analternate way to illustrate
this is shown in graph 6. The mathmatical combination of these two curves yields
graph 14.
Discussion
The loss of heat resistance occurs rapidly. Considering the thermal regime experienced
by Tigriopus Californicus the retention of heat resistance at lower temperatures
would be at best inefficient and at worst maladaptive depending on the nature of the
change which induces resistance. But more interestingly, when one considers the work
of Kontogiannis (Kontogiannis 1973) the time course of the loss of heat resistance
appears to be symetrical to its acquisition. This has two implications. First, the loss
of resistance probably involves the remodification of a structure or process by the
same mechanism by which it was initially change. Speculatively, the modification is
a simple one, at least in terms of stretural reorganization, if not biochemical.
Hochachaka and Somera (Hochachaka and Somera 1973) have proposed that immediate
acclimation to temperature involves the modification of enzme affinities for
substrate or co-factors in energy pathway enzymes. With the modification of Km
values in these enzymes, the general restructuring of biochemical pathways caused
by increases in temperature (Johnson 1954) could be avoided. In this way heat death
may be circumvented. If not offering any concrete support for this point of view,
my results are at least consistant with it. Affinity changes can be affected simply
by modifications in the 3' and 4' structure of enzymes. Temperature is capable of
inducing such changes. The fact that modification and remodification appear symetric
