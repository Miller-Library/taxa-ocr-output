INTRODUCTION
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tigriopus californicus : Exact'>Tigriopus californicus</span> is a harpactecoid copepod inhabiting
high intertidal splash pools, which are subject to rapid
and large changes in salinity. Since they are found active
between 5 and 120 0/00, their osmoregulatory behavior is of
considerable interest. This is especially true because
the two studies on the subject appear to be contradictory.
Patterson (1968), based on analysis of gut fluid, claims
that <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Trigriopus</span> is a conformer while Fisher and Bassett
(1976), using fluid from whole body squashes, found a unique
mode of osmotic regulation.
Both conformation and regulation have been demonstrated
for euryhaline crustacea. This may involve hyperosmotic
regulation, hyposmotic regulation and, in some cases, both
(Prosser 1973). The unique behavior of Trigriopus involves
conformation at intermediate salinities with hyposmotic
regulation at high salinities and hyperosmotic regulation
at low salinities.
MATERIALS and METHODS
A. Body Fluid Osmolarity
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tigriopus : Exact'>Tigriopus</span> were collected for each trial from a high
tidepool (40 0/00 salinity) on Mussel Pt., Pacific Grove,
California during May 1977. 100 animals were acclimated
to each of the salinities: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 40, 45,
50, 55, 60, 68, 75, 85, and 120 0/00 for 38 - 44 hours
(trial 1) and 47 - 53 hours (trial 2). Females carrying
eggsacs were not used. Acclimation was begun on the same
day the collections were made.
A sample of total body fluid was obtained using the
technique of Fisher and Bassett (1976) as follows. The
acclimated animals were pipetted onto a millipore suction
filter and washed with 2 - 4 mls. distilled water to remove
any residual salt from their bodies. The animals and filter
were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 1500 r.p.m. to dry the
animals. The filter was placed on dry ice and the frozen
animals scraped off into a watch glass where they were
ground with dry ice into a powder. This powder was scraped
into a capillary tube (1.1 - 1.2 mm internal diameter,
25 mm long and fused at one end) and centrifuged for at
least 3 hours at 1300 r.p.m. to separate body fluid from
body parts. A melting point determination was done using
the comparitive melting point method of Gross (1954).
Time points were taken as the last crystal to melt.
Controls to correct for errors such as condensation
from the air onto the groud sample were done. A potato
starch and water (salinities 40, 50, 60 0/00 were tested)
suspension was made in a watch glass and frozen with dry ice.
This was ground with dry ice scraped into a capillary tube
and centrifuged for 2 hours at 1300 r.p.m. The melting point
was found for the controls and the samples could be corrected
by the average error.
B. Gut Volume vs. salinity
About 50 animals were acclimated for four hours in
25 mls. of salinities 5, 20, 35, 55, 85, .5, and 120 0/00
(the latter two sets of animals were in torpor - the state
of apparent death). Several animals at a time were placed
under a compound microscope using pleces of broken coverslip
under the coverslip to prevent crushing of the animals.
Measurements of the width of the posterior and anterior
portions of the gut and of the length of the animal were
made. Animals with fecal pellets were not used because the
pellet caused a substancial increase in gut width. The
gut is nearly cylindrical and its length is entirely dependent
on the length of the animal, therefore width of anterior
portion plus width of posterior portion of the gut divided
by length of the animal is used to give an index of gut
volume corrected for animal size.
C. Metabolism study
Several hundred animals were acclimated for 24 hours
in 30 ml. baths of salinity 5, 10, 20, 35, 45, 55, 60,
and 85 0/00. A Gillson constant pressure respirometer was
used and three replicates for each salinity were tested.
Readings were taken every 15 minutes for an hour to make
sure the O2 consumption rate was constant. After the run,
the animals were dried in an oven (70 degrees F.) to constant
weight, then weighed.
RESULTS
A. Body Fluid Osmolarity
The data given in figure one shows a pattern of regulation
in low salinity, conformation in intermediate salinity and
regulation in high salinity. The data points are corrected
by 10 0/00 which represents the decrease in concentration
during the processing of controls. The two trials are stat-
istically different with respect to hyposmotic regulation
(T test: p£.02) and hyperosmotic regulation (T test:p (.003).
On all figures, the vertical dashed line is the approximate
EDgo for torpor.
B. Gut Volume vs. Salinity
As figure 2 shows, the gut volume changes significantly
with the onset of the torpor state. A 54% decrease in volume
is observed between 5 0/00 and low salinity torpor while
an increase of 92% is observed between 85 0/00 and high
salinity torpor at 120 0/00. In order to determine if the
gut volume at 5 0/00 was significantly larger than at the
other non-torpor salinities, a predicted value for 5 0/00
was obtained using the method of least squared linear reg¬
ression to extrapolate the non-torpor salinity data to
5 0/00. The standard error for this value was found using
the method of Sokal and Rohlf, Box 14.3. Using a student
T test, the actual and predicted values were found to be
different (p).025).
C. Metabolism Study
Figure 3 shows that Tigriopus' O, consumption decreases
with increasing salinities. There appears to be no significant
change in O, consumption between 35 and 60 0/00. Each
O consumption value is the mean of 3 data points for a given
salinity.
DISCUSSION
Euryhaline animals exhibit a wide variety of osmotic
behavior. Some conform, though they in general, buffer the
intracellular environment against ionic change by adjusting
the amino acid concentrations. Regulating animals do so
over a range of salinities, and show conformance on either
side. The arthropod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Artemia : Exact'>Artemia,</span> like Tigriopus, is exposed to
large variations in osmotic pressure. Their response is
to regulate their body fluid at a relatively constart level,
markedly hypotonic to all except the lowest salinities
(Croghan 1958). Tigriopus' osmotic behavior is unusual
but highly adaptive to its habitat - high tidepools of constantly
changing salinities, and hence changing osmotic pressures,
as a result of the interaction between weather, tides and
high waves. Most salinities are between 30 and 60 0/00
but pools are commonly found substantially beyond these
values on both sides.
Tigriopus were found to conform between salinities
25 and 60 0/00 which corresponds to the usual tide pool
salinities. Since regulation requires energy, it is adaptive
for Tigriopus to conform to the common fluctuations in salinity.
Outside of the conforming range, Tigriopus regulate their
body fluid until a state of torpor is induced. This greatly
inhances Tigriopus' ability to survive in their tidepool
habitat, which often exceeds the salinity levels over which
they conform. The state of torpor, induced by extreme
osmotic stress (2 0/00 and 120 0/00), seems to be a shutting
down of most body functions. In this state Tigriopus can
survive the extreme salinity levels for extended periods
of time (David Stoller 1977).
Patterson (1968) reported Tigriopus to be conformers
based on osmotic concentration of gut fluid which was assumed
to be isosmotic with body fluid. This assumption is probably
incorrect since Tigriopus drink while active (Patterson 1968).
Further, the studies reported here and by Fisher and Bassett
(1976) indicate that the fluid from whole animal squashes
is regulated. In addition, gut volume changes occurring
during torpor can be best explained by assuming the gut to
be nearly isosmotic with the environment while
body fluids are regulated.
Upon entry into low salinity torpor, the gut volume
decreases drastically which is what would happen if the gut
were isosmotic with the environment and the animal stopped
regulating in torpor. For the same reasons, the gut is
expected to, and does, expand with the onset of high salinity
torpor. Hence the gut must be allowing water passage in
torpor which is not compensated by some active process.
An arguement may be made that the gut epithelium is
the site of regulation. The gut volume was larger than
normal in a 5 0/00 environment. This may imply that the
gut is pumping water out of the body to maintain hypertonicity
of the body fluids. Another line of evidence is the gut
volume changes observed when individuals enter torpor.
Thus when regulation ceases or is diminished in the gut
lining the osmotic flux begins. The gut also presents a
major surface area with permiability, access to internal and
external fluid environments, circulation of both by peristaltic
contractions and literature support for gut epithelia in¬
volvement in regulation in other <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Crustacea : Exact'>Crustacea</span> (Artemia regulate
via the gut (Croghan 1958)). On the other hand the body
surface is covered with an exoskeleton of presumed low
permeability (Fisher and Bassett 1976) and shows no obvious
areas of morphological specialization for exchange.
If the gut fluid is isosmotic with the environment
and it makes up a significant portion of the total body
fluid measured, the hemolymph and other internal body fluid
must be at a different concentration than the values obtained
during regulation. A corrected value for real body fluid
may be obtainable. Gut volume and total water content
(from dessication experiments) used to estimate real body
fluid volume would be a good place to start. The concentration
of the body fluid could then be calculated using the gut
volume change in torpor.
In trial one the onset of regulation occurys sooner
than it does in trial two. Trial two was acclimated for
nine hours longer which suggests that Tigriopus when given
a longer acclimation period may tolerate a broader range
of salinities without regulation. This must be tested with
longer and shorter acclimation periods.
Measurement of O, consumption at various salinities
shows a respiratory pattern similar to that of most euryhaline
species (Prosser 1973). Metabolism is high at low salinities
and decreases as salinity increases. The line appears to
be fairly level between 35 and 60 0/00 which coincides
with the conforming zone - no metabolic change in response
to salinity change. There was no monitoring of activity
or other metabolic changes that may occur with salinity
variation (Lockwood from Newell 1976), therefore O, consumption
changes related to osmoregulation may be at least pertially
masked.
SUMMARY
Tigriopus californicus exhibit a unique osmoregulatory
behavior which is highly adaptive in the high splash pool
habitat. They conform osmotically in intermediate salinities
and regulate hypo and hyper osmotically in high and low salinities
respectively.
Gut fluid appears to remain isosmotic with the environment.
Evidence is presented to suggest the gut may be a regulatory
surface in Tigriopus.
The range of osmoconformance depends on the length
of acclimation to a given salinity.
O consumption in Tigriopus is high in low salinities
decreasing as salinity rises. Metabolism appears not to change
significantly over the conforming range 35 to 60 0/00.
