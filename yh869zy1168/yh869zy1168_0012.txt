recorded was equal to that recorded when the preparation was bubbled
in Ca"'-free sea water (0.05g). A similar result was obtained upon
bubbling after one hour in the regular sea water. Bubbling after three
hours yielded an F.(10) of twice the amplitude of that yielded after one
hour, yet it was still in the force range previously deemed to be char¬
acteristic of spines out of catch (0.lg). Finally, the preparation was
left in the regular sea water overnight (nine hours) after which time an
F.(10) characteristic of spines in catch (cf. Fig. 5) was yielded:
O.38g. Thus, the spine had recovered.
Ca'-free sea water was then applied to a ligament in catch to see
if it could abolish catch. The results obtained were negative, showing
that the maintenance of the catch state was not Ca dependent.
Are disulphide bonds involved in catch?
Ascaris collagen contains 27/1000 residues of 4 cystine and is
known to form cross-links by means of disulphone bonds between these
residues (Wainwright et al., 1976). The possibility of the occurence of
such disulphide cross-linking between the collagen fibrils in the spine
ligaments of sea urchins was here considered. The chemicals used to
test for this were ditiothreitol (DTT) and N—-ethyl maleimide (NEM).
These were used in 5 x 10 'M concentrations. DTT breaks disulphide
linkages, and was therefore applied to ligaments in catch to see if it
could abolish this catch. NEM prevents the formation of disulphide
linkages, and was therefore applied to ligaments out of catch; sub¬
sequent bubbling and recording of F (10) would determine whether it had
prevented the setting of catch. F (10)'s offered before and after
