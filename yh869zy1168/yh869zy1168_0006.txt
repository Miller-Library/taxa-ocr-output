For all experiments resistive force was defined as the highest
point of the curve recorded. Thus, for spines in catch, resisitive
force was taken to be the amplitude of the initial, sharp peak.
Determination of the contractile force of the muscle layer surrounding
ligament.
Prior to detailed examination of the physical properties of the
spine ligament, it was necessary to obtain a measure of the contractile
force (F.) of which its surrounding muscle was capable. A comparison
of this force with that offered upon 10° deflection of a spine in catch
would determine whether the preparation was to consist of a stripped
ligament or whether the muscular layer around the ligament could be
left intact.
A test spine with muscle intact was connected to the force trans¬
ducer as shown in Fig. la. F was measured by using a probe to mechan¬
ically stimulate the portion of the test immediately before that region
of the muscle layer facing away from the transducer. This caused the
muscle to contract and attempt deflection of the spine, thereby pulling
against the transducer and yielding discreet peaks on the chart re¬
corder (Fig. 4, top arrows). The test spine was subsequently stripped
of its muscle and set into catch. Fy(10) was recorded (Fig. 4, bottom
arrow) and this was compared with the F
The results showed that
2/3 F, a force too great to be ignored. All experiments were
therefore run on ligaments stripped of their surrounding muscle.
