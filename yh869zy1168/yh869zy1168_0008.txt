deflections beyond this (in this case 20° and 30°--Fig. 6b) yielded
resistive forces of decreasing magnitude. These results suggest that a
ligament in catch begins to be damaged at spine deflections of between
10° and 20°.
Computation of Young's Modulus (E) for a ligament in catch.
Young's Modulus is a measure of the tensile stiffness of a material.
Measurement of stress (force/cross-sectional area) at varying strain
(change in ligament length/original ligament length) was done by using
the "tensometer" of Figure 2 (see Methods), and the data obtained were
plotted in the form of a stree-strain curve (Fig. 7). From the slope
of this curve at 0.58 strain, Young's Modulus (stress/strain) was calcu¬
lated to be 2.8 x 10° N/m", a value similar to that given for vertebrate
tendon at the same strain, namely, 3.5 x 10° N/m (Wainwright, Biggs,
Currey and Gosline, 1976).
Young's Modulus was also calculated theoretically by a mathematical
derivation of E based on a schematic diagram of the spine-ligament
system (Fig. 8). The value obrained was 1.1 x 10° N/m", which, consider¬
ing the potential sources of error in ligament dimension measurements,
is certainly consistent with that obtained experimentally (see
Appendix A).
Relationship between resistive force and angular deflection for a spine
in catch.
A spine in catch was deflected incrementally to different angles and
the resistive force offered at each angle was recorded (Fig. 9). It was
