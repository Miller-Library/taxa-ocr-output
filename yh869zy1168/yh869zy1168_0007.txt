Definition of catch and non-catch in a population of spines.
F (10)'s were measured for 88 spines, some agitated and some not,
to obtain an objective definition of catch versus non-catch. Spine
length for all trials was relatively constant (approximately 2.5 cm) and
so no normalization of results by lever arm was considered necessary.
Nor was ligament cross-sectional area taken into account for the same
reasons.
The forces recorded and the number of spines offering each force
were plotted in the form of a histogram (Fig. 5). It was observed that
most spines fell into two categories, one having a range for F (10) of
0.00—0.10g, the other of 0.34—-064g. The former category was deemed
characteristic of spines out of catch, the latter of spines in catch.
Any F (10)'s recorded which were greater than 0.64g were also considered
characteristic of spines in catch. Whether these larger values might
have resulted from slight errors in angular deflection measurements
(which would have resulted in large differences in resistive forces
recorded-see next two sections), differences in spine length, or some
other variable is unclear.
Critical deflection angle for irreversible damage.
Having defined the state of catch, it was now possible to look more
closely at its mechanical properties. First to come to light was that
there seemed to be a limit to the extent a ligament in catch could be
stretched before its constitution was unalterably changed. It was
observed that repeated spine deflections of 10° or less yielded re¬
sistive forces of similar magnitude (Fig. 6a), whereas repeated
