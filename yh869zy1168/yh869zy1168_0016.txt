and angular deflection (ad) presented in Fig. 9. At first sight, these
graphs appear not to be similar, although their variables would suggest
that they ought to be: F is directly proportional to stress (through
cross-sectional area) and ad is an indirect, but linear (for small
angles), way of measuring strain. From Fig. 8, conversion of strain to
equivalent ad is possible. This shows that the graphs are indeed simi¬
lar, and that they differ only in extent. The maximum strain to which
the spine ligament was subjected was 2.58 (Fig. 7), and this corresponds
to an ad of 5.4° (using a ligament length (L) of 4 mm and a ligament
radius (x) of 1 mm). Thus, the range of the stress-strain curve is
equivalent to that part of the F-ad curve over angles of 0°--5.4°.
Moreover, the slope of the stress-strain curve would have probably risen
steeply had more strain (that is, greater than 2.58) been applied to the
caught ligament, in harmony with the F-ad curve.
Experiments were also conducted to test possible nervous control
of the catch state. The findings of these experiments would suggest
that nervous control is either not involved, or is only a part of a
greater mechanism. On the other hand, experiments conducted to test
possible enzymatic control offer strong (although it must be emphasized
still preliminary) evidence for the role of transglutaminase or TGL in
the mechanism of catch.
Transglutaminase has been observed to play a part in several
clotting-type processes in a wide variety of organisms, and in particu¬
lar in the cross-linking of collagen fibres in both vertebrates and in¬
vertebrates (Folk, 1980). Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that
it might also play a part in the cross-linking of collagen fibrils in
the spine ligaments in sea urchins.
