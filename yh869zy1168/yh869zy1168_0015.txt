(measured under constant load) of 0.3--0.4 mm in the spines they term
"movable" decreased dramatically relative to extensions on either side
of this range. This means that in this region, the ligaments were
suddenly offering an increased resistance to stretch. When extension
was carried out beyond 0.4 mm, an increased rate of extension per time
was observed, as though the ligaments had become damaged or structurally
weakened. Smith et al. do not discuss this result, but it may reflect
functional passage through the 10°--20° critical angle range described
above. By using the schematic diagram of Fig 8, the range of angular
deflection which corresponds to their "critical" 0.3--0.4 mm extension
range can be calculated. If a ligament radius (x) of 1.0 mm is taken
for the ligaments they were using, as estimated from their micrographs
(see their Fig. 4), 0.3--0.4 mm ligament extensions (1) are seen to be
equivalent to angular deflections of 16.9°--21.8°. This was precisely
the range in which the critical angle for damage was found to lie in this
study.
Exactly what happens at this angle requires a model for the liga¬
ment system and the mechanism of catch maintenance by the collagen
fibrils. According to the ideas presented by Smith et al., this
critical angle may represent the limiting amount of stretch which the
cross-links between the collagen fibrils making up the ligament can
withstand before suffering breakage. Since the breakage appears to be
largely irreversible (cf. Fig. 6), it can be concluded that the cross¬
links are not capable of reformation once broken by excessive stretch.
Another index of the stress-strain relationship of the spine liga¬
ment is given by the relationship between resistive force offered (F
