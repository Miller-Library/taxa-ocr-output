application was to ligaments in catch to see if effects similar to
those in molluscs could occur in the sea urchin, that is, the release
of catch. Once more, the results obtained were negative (all chemical
analysis results are summarized in Table I).
The effects of Ca on catch.
Wilkie (1978) proposed that the ionic composition of the matrix sur¬
rounding the collagen fibrils in echinoderm connective tissue is re¬
sponsible for the maintenance of catch. A variation in inter-fibrillar
ionic composition might, therefore, influence catch in the spine liga¬
ments of sea urchins. Smith et al. (1981) have demonstrated that the
absence of divalent cation prevents the setting of catch in these liga¬
ments. This has been confirmed in this study for the divalent cation
Ca". A ligament in a state of non-catch was bathed in Ca -free sea
water (see Methods) for five minutes and then bubbled in the same medium
for a further ten minutes to see if the physical agitation which normal¬
ly sets catch in regular sea water could do so here, in the absence of
Ca". Positive results were obtained, indicating that the setting of
catch is Ca dependent.
Smith et al. also state that the prevention of catch in their ex¬
-free and Ca" -Mg -free sea waters was reversible, but
periments by Ca
they give no indication of the time course for these reversals. Follow¬
ing the above described experiment, the preparation was bathed in
regular sea water to determine the extent of time required for the
recovery of catch. It was found that bubbling the preparation in this
new medium after 30 minutes could not induce catch-indeed, the F (10)
