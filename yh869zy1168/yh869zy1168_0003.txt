biomechanical properties of the spine ligaments has been conducted, and
an exploration of possible control mechanisms, especially those involving
nervous and enzymatic processes, has been undertaken.
METHODS
Strongylocentrotus fransiscanus and S. purpuratus were obtained from
the subtidal and intertidal regions, respectively, of Monterey Bay.
Specimens were kept in running sea water (15°C) and well oxygenated
tanks.
The experimental preparation consisted of an urchin test with the
Aristotle's Lantern removed. The inside of the test was scraped out to
eliminate any participation of the internal nervous system (e.g. radial
nerves). The ligaments to be studied were stripped of their surrounding
muscle and epithelial layers. The entire preparation was held steady
by pushing a rubber stopper through that portion of the test previously
occupied by the Aristotle's Lantern and firmly mounting this on a plexi¬
glass base placed in a glass dish filled with sea water.
Test spines were connected to a Pixie element force transducer
(Endevco Corp.) by means of cylindrical caps made of stainless steel
hypodermic tubing fitted over their tips (Fig la). The connexion be¬
tween spine cap and force transducer was rigid stainless steel wire
which could swivel at the spine cap to maintain horizontal transducer
pull. The force transducer was attached to a micromanipulator, and
lateral movement of the transducer produced spine deflections through
desired angles. Angle was measured by a protractor attached to a second
micromanipulator and brought up immediately behind the spine. Any
