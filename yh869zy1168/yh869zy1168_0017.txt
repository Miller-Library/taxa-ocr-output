Now it has been demonstrated that the setting of catch is Ca
dependent. Ca could participate in at least two important control
processes: the conduction of nervous activity, especially neurosecretion,
and the activation of an enzymatic reaction chain. Concerning the
latter, it is known that transglutaminase requires Ca' to convert it
from its zymogen form to its active state (Lorand, 1976). Thus, if
catch were controlled by transglutaminase or TGL, then the absence of
Ca"' should block its setting by preventing the activation of this
enzyme.
An important question which must now be addressed concerns the
whereabouts of the transglutaminase or TGL store. Smith et al. state
that in the ligament, "axons contain large numbers of opaque secretory
droplets." Could the contents of these vesicles be the enzyme, and
therefore these vesicles the enzyme store? If so, then the following
mechanism could be conceived: Ca" ions trigger the neurosecretory
release of transglutaminase or TGL and their subsequent activation,
enabling them to catalyze the cross-linking of the collagen fibrils and
thereby set catch. This would explain the requirement of Ca" for the
setting of catch. However, this model would not be able to explain the
observed long recovery time (many hours) for a ligament when its Ca
supply is depleted and then replenished. It would seem that once the
Ca" supply had been replenished, the ligament should immediately
regain its ability to catch.
Bearing this problem in mind, a more satisfactory mechanism is the
following. Ca" again permits neurosecretory activity of the nerve
fibres which run through the ligament, but the released substance is
