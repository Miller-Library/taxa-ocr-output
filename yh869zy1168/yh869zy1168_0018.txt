not enzyme, rather, it is an essential cofactor. This cofactor
activates the enzyme which is already present in the medium surrounding
the collagenfibrils. Ca must play one further role, however: it must
somehow prevent the loss of the enzyme by diffusion in a stripped liga¬
ment surrounded by regular sea water. One possibility is that Ca
mediates or stabilizes the binding of the enzyme to some extracellular
structure, such as the collagen fibrils themselves or the external sur¬
face of the nerve endings. The latter of these two seems the more
likely, for it would give the ligament system more control of the catch
mechanism by bringing the point of release and the point of action of
the cofactor closer. It would also for the same reason tend to conserve
cofactor and avoid any spontaneous cross-linking of the collagen fibrils
resulting in spontaneous catch. Taking the surface of the nerve endings
then as a likely place for the location of the transglutaminase of TGL,
released factor might thus "activate" the Ca -enzyme complex by causing
its release from its anchoring structures, allowing it then to cross¬
link the collagen fibrils and set catch.
This mechanism clearly incorporates the observation that the
setting of catch id Ca dependent. In addition, it also explains the
long recovery time after treatment with Ca" -free sea water. Removal
of Ca" from the medium surrounding a ligament would not only prevent
the neurosecretion of cofactor, it would also result in the release of
inactive enzyme into the inter-fibrillar matrix. Within a short time,
this inactive enzyme would diffuse out of the ligament and be lost to
the surrounding medium. Resupply of Ca would immediately reestablish
the ability of the neurosecretory vesicles to release cofactor,
