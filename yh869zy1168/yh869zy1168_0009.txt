found that the relationship between these two variable was not linear.
Below deflections of approximately 8°, the curve resembled that obtained
for stress versus strain (Fig. 7). Above deflections of 8°, however,
the curve began to rise sharply, an increase in resistive force coincid¬
ing with the region of angular deflection in which the critical angle
for damage has been found to lie. The increase in resistive force is
probably due to the application of deflective force directly on to the
inter-fibrillar cross-links which cause catch in the collagenous ligament.
Consequently, excessive force applied here would tend to break these
cross-links and thereby abolish catch. Hence the occurence of the
critical angle for damage in this region.
Consideration of possible nervous control of catch.
Takahashi (1967) reported that the tonus of an isolated strip of
ligament connected to spine and single ossicle was increased by the
addition of 10 Macetylcholine (ACh) and decreased by the addition of
10 "M adrenalin (Adr). Tonus was assessed by the rate of isotonic
lengthening of ligament preparations under a constant load. The rate
decreased upon the addition of ACh and increased upon the addition of
Adr, although the extent of length change is unclear, for his figure has
no vertical scale bar (cf. Boolootian, 1966).
An attempt to verify these results was made here by measuring the
F (10)'s offered by ligaments before and after chemical treatment: sim¬
ilar pre- and post-treatment Fy(10)'s constituted negative results and
indicated that the chemicals had been ineffective, whereas dissimilar
Fy(10)'s (a post-treatment increase showing the setting of catch, a
