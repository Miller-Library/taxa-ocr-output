treatment with DTT were similar, showing that this chemical had had no
effect on the maintenance of catch. F (10)'s offered upon bubbling after
NEM had been added were considerably greater than those offered before
bubbling (having an amplitude, 0.43g, characteristic of spines in catch),
showing that NEM had not prevented the setting of catch. Both these sets
of results suggest that disulphide cross-linking is not involved in the
setting or maintenance of catch in the spine ligaments of sea urchins.
The effects of protein inhibitors on catch.
Dansylcadaverine and putrescine act as substrates for the enzyme
transglutaminase, and thereby inhibit its biological functions when
added to a system in excess. Transglutaminase will catalyze, for ex¬
ample, the incorporation of dansylcadaverine into a convenient protein
receptor such as casein, and measurement of the protein bound fluores¬
cence of this reaction has been used to ascertain the potency of this
enzyme (Lorand, 1976). In vertebrates, transglutaminase is known to
catalyze the cross-linking of the fibrin clot during haemostasis, and
the production of the vaginal plug by postejaculatory clotting of rodent
seminal plasma (Folk, 1980). It is also known to catalyze the in vitro
formation of cross-links between fibronectin and collagen in cultured
fibroblasts of rat kidney (Folk, 1980).
In light of these observations, it seemed possible that trans¬
glutaminase or a transglutaminase-like enzyme (TGL) might be involved
in the cross-linking of collagen fibrils which constitutes the state
of catch. Dansylcadaverine and putrescine were applied to both lig¬
aments out of catch. The application to ligaments already in catch
