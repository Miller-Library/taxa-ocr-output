and putrescine, all of which were given ten minutes). The tests examin¬
ing the effects of acetylcholine and adrenaline were done four times,
and all other tests twice. The chemicals used were stored in opague
vessels to avoid any light-catalyzed oxidations, and were kept at a
temperature of 4°C. Finall, Ca" -free sea water was made up in the fol¬
lowing proportions (M): 0.445 Nacl, 0.060 Mgcl., 0.010 KCl, 0.015 EGTA,
and 0.010 Tris buffer (pH 7.8).
RESULTS
Typical data for spines out of catch and in catch
Figure 3 (a) shows a record of resistive force offered for a 10°
deflection (F (10) by a spine out of catch. Figure 3(b) shows the
E (10) for the same spine in catch. Figure 3(c) shows a record of
E (10) of a different spine in catch obtained from the same test.
The difference in record amplitude between the spine out of catch
and the two spines in catch is clear. Also significant is the shape
difference of the two types of record: the spine out of catch offers an
F (10) which takes the form of a step function, whereas the spines in
catch offer F (10)'s which show an initial, sharp peak followed by a
"sag" that eventually levels off to a steady state value. Finally
worthy of note is the shape difference within the catch records them¬
selves, namely, the extent of sag, in this case being more pronounced in
(c) than in (b). The basis of this sag is not completely understood,
but it seems to be characteristic of the catch state, and may well be
an indication of the quality of catch, more pronounced sag implying a
weaker state.
