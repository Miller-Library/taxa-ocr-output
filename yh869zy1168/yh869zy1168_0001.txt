ABSTRACT Spines of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus fransiscanus
were deflected through varying angles and the resistive forces offered
by their ligaments were recorded. Data obtained for spines out of catch
and spines in catch show basic differences in shape as well as amplitude.
This difference in shape was also observed in the data obtained for dif¬
ferent spines in catch. The contractile force of the muscle layer at
the base of the sea urchin spines was determined and found to be sig¬
nificant in comparison to the resistive forces upon 10° deflection
offered by the spine ligaments when in a state of catch. A survey of a
population of spines, both agitated and non-agitated, was conducted to
obtain an objective definition of the state of catch versus non-catch.
An angular limit to deflection was found to exist for spines in catch,
beyond which their ligaments would become irreversibly damaged. Ex¬
perimental and mathematical calculation of Young's Modulus was done for
a spine ligament in catch, and this was found to be similar to that
given for vertebrate tendon at the same strain. The relationship be¬
tween resistive force offered and angular deflection was examined, and
it was found to be non-linear. The possibility of nervous control of
catch was considered, although results obtained make this seem unlikely.
That the setting of catch is Ca"' dependent was here confirmed. Further¬
more, the reversibility of the effects of Ca depletion were confirmed,
although the process of reversal remains unclear, for recovery time was
found to be very long. The effects of protein inhibitors on catch were
also studied, and the preliminary results provide strong evidence for
an enzymatic mechanism in the control of catch.
