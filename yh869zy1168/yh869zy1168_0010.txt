post-treatment decrease showing the releasing of catch) constituted
positive results and indicated that the chemicals had been effective.
For all chemical analysis, the following control was used. Methylene
blue was applied by Pasteur pipette to a stripped ligament. The ques¬
tion to be addressed was whether chemical solutions applied to a lig¬
ament could penetrate it and thus exhibit their maximum effect, or
whether the density of the ligament prevented their diffusion and
restricted them to the ligament's outer surface, thereby dampening their
potential effects. After one minute, the ligament was cut open to re¬
veal its inner surface. This was found to be blue in colour, showing
that the ligament was indeed permeable to liguids.
ACh was used in 10 'M concentrations and Adr in 10 M concentra¬
tions. ACh was applied to both ligaments out of catch, to see if catch
could be induced, and ligaments in catch, to see if some extreme state
of catch, otherwise unattainable by mere physical agitation, could be
induced. Adr was applied to ligaments in catch to see if it could
abolish this state. The results obtained in all cases were negative.
As another test of cholinergic control of catch, curare was applied
in concentrations of 10 "M to a ligament in catch to see if this catch
could be abolished. If catch were ACh dependent, then curare, by
blocking any ACh recepors present within the ligament, might abolish
catch. The results obtained were again negative, lending further
testimony to the catch state's independence of ACh.
Other catecholamines were also tested, namely, serotonin and
dopamine. These are known to release catch in the non-straiated muscle
of molluscs (Florey, 1966). Concentrations used were 10 M and
