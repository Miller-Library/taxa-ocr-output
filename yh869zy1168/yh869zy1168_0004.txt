resistance to deflection by a spine would bend the legs of the trans¬
ducer and thereby cause an increase in resistance in one of its semi¬
conductor elements and a decrease in resistance in the other (Fig. 1b).
The ratio of the resistances was linearly transformed into a voltage by
an operational amplifier circuit. The measurement of force was essential¬
ly isometric; that is, the transducer bending was a very small fraction
of spine deflection (O.lu/g compared to approximately 5 m.m./10°). Data
was recorded on a Brush 220 pen oscillograph.
Stress versus strain was measured by a "tensometer" (Fig. 2). The
preparation here used consisted of a ligament in catch with spine and
single ossicle attached. The preparation was held between one clamp
mounted on an anchored double cantilever beam and another clamp mounted
on a plate moved by a lead screw. Force was sensed by deflection of the
double beam and was monitored by a linearly variable differentiated
transducer (LVDT) on the anchored plate. Deformation of the sample was
monitored by an LVDT mounted on a moving plate. The voltage output of
the LVDT was registered on a chart recorder. The maximum stress measur¬
able was 0.85 N and the maximum strain 408 (cf. Tansey, 1983).
The most effective way to induce catch in the spine ligament was
found to be physical agitation. The preparation to be studied would be
placed in a glass dish filled with sea water. Through this sea water
would be bubbled a constant stream of air for ten minutues, following
which time experimentation would begin.
All chemicals used were applied in drops by means of a Pasteur
pipette directly on the stripped ligaments in 2 ml volumes per trial and
given three minutes to take effect (except DTT, NEM, dansylcadaverine
