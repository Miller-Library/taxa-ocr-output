ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First and foremost, endless gratitude is due Professor William
Frank Gilly. His seemingly indefatigable drive and attention, which
would pick up my spirits when all else was crumbling, his sharp-edged
wit, which at the best of times was only just bearable, and his acute
but truly constructive criticism, which would restrain the energy of an
oftentimes overzealous undergraduate and firmly warn him against imÂ¬
pulsiveness and the dangers of getting "too big for one's boots," all
contributed tremendously to my development as a thoughtful, cautious
and honest scientist.
Thanks must also go to Mark Denny, without whose insight and warm
encouragement I may never have ventured into the wild world of
biomechanics, and to David Epel, whose marksmanship may have hit the
bull even "in the dark." Let me also express appreciation to Stuart
Thompson for his valuable feedback on directions for further research
and to all those who had the courage to inquire, the patience to
listen, and the interest to criticize.
Finally, let me thank the sea urchin itself for providing me with
such an exciting but at the same time accessible system to study, a
system which I find more baffling now than when I started and which I
hope to come back to soon.
