was a control for any reactions other than the suspected enzymatic one,
The control application gave negative results, showing that the in¬
hibitors did not abolish catch. On the other hand, the application to
ligaments out of catch produced positive results, for post-treatment
bubbling could not induce catch in these ligaments. This showed that
the inhibitors could prevent the setting of catch, and in so doing
presented evidence for a potential enzymatic mechanism for the control
of the catch state, one which would involve possibly transglutaminase
or an enzyme similarly sensitive to dansylcadaverine and putrescine
inhibition.
DISCUSSION
This paper presents measurements of the mechanical properties of
the spine ligaments in sea urchins and considers some possible physiolog¬
ical control mechanisms. It confirms and extends, on a different urchin
genus, the basic findings of Smith et al. It also offers suggestive
preliminary evidence for a Ca dependent enzymatic mechanism of collagen
cross-linking as the basis for setting catch.
One new and important finding reported here is the occurence of
some sort of structural damaging or weakening when a spine in catch is
deflected through an angle of between 10° and 20°. A similar alteration
in ligament constitution at approximately the same amount of stretch
appears to have occured in the experiments of Smith et al. Although
they do not consider this idea per se, they do present a plot of ex¬
tension versus time for ligaments stretched vertically along the long
axes of their spines (see their Fig. 3). Extensibility at a stretch
