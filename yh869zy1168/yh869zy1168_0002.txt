INTRODUCTION
The spines of the sea urchin are connected to the animal's test by
means of a ball and socket joint. Three concentric cylinders constitute
this joint: an outer epithelial layer, a middle muscular layer, and an
inner ligamental layer. The structure of this joint enables the sea
urchin to move its spines freely in all directions by contraction of the
muscular layers in the direction of deflection. This is apparently ac¬
companied by active shortening of the inner ligamental layer (Smith,
Wainwright, Baker and Cayer, 1981).
Agitation of an urchin, however, causes its spines to "freeze" and
their movement to be inhibited. This is known as "catch." Although the
mechanisms for setting and maintaining catch are not well understood,
cross-linking of the collagen fibrils which make up the inner ligamental
layer appears to be involved (Smith et al., 1981). Also involved seems
to be the ionic composition of the inter-fibrillar matrix of the col¬
lagenous tissue (Wilkie, 1978). Unfortunately, good data on the rates
at which catch can be set and released in vivo are entirely lacking.
This catch should not be confused with the superficially similar
phenomenon which occurs in the non-striated muscle of molluscs, as first
described in Pecten maximus by von Uexkull (1912) and extensively studied
in Mytilus edulis by Twarog (1954). This catch is due to neurally con¬
trolled muscle activity, whereas that of the sea urchin spine ligaments
does not involve muscle at all (Kawaguti and Kamishima, 1965), although
it would appear to be under neural control in the living urchin.
In this paper, an attempt has been made to shed light on this
non-muscular type of catch. In particular, an examination of the
