Juvenile salmon sharks beach yearly along the California coast during late
summer and early fall. To determine the epidemiological condition of beached animals,
frozen and formalin fixed beached specimens were collected from various Fish and Game
facilities for examination and freshly beached specimens were also examined when
possible. Histology revealed meningoencephalitis with intralesional bacteria in almost all
of the specimens, including the freshly beached sharks, suggesting that this infection
plays a role in this unusual behavior. The pathogenic bacteria was cultured from four
separate shark specimens, and each isolate was characterized serologically and
biochemically as belonging to the genus Carnobacteria. In order to identify the species,
we sequenced -540 bp of the 16s ribosomal DNA and a similarly sized portion of the
large ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (ITS or ISR). The 16s sequences obtained from
all samples were identical and 99% similar to <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. piscicola.</span> The ISR sequences obtained
from all samples were also identical to each other, but were only 92% homologous to C.
piscicola, and did not match closely with any other sequence in GenBank. This is the
first report of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Carnobacterium : Exact'>Carnobacterium</span> infection in any shark species, though the identity of the
pathogenic bacteria remains uncertain.
Introduction
During the summer and fall of every year, young salmon sharks (£ Im in length)
are found beached along the coast of California. To determine the cause of this unusual
behavior, eleven beached salmon sharks representing the past three years' beachings were
collected and analyzed histologically. Bacterial meningitis was noted in almost all of the
brains by pathologist Dr. Corrine Davis at the Research Animal Facility (RAF) of the
Stanford University Comparative Medicine Department. Bacteria were successfully
cultured by microbiologist Dr. Barry Lifland at RAF from the brain tissue of four freshly
beached specimens. Standard microbiological tests were performed to determine the type
of bacteria that appeared to be infecting these sharks, and the field was narrowed down to
the generus of Carnobacteria.
Species of Carnobacteria are found frequently in the intestine and gills of both
fresh and salt water fishes, in aquaculture and in wild populations (eg Ringo et al., 2000;
Ringo et al., 2001; Joborn, 1999). The bacteria of this genus are generally considered to
be part of the normal microfloral community in the gut and on the gill surfaces, and
pathenogenesis of the bacteria of this genus is rarely considered. In fact, species of
Carnobacteria are frequently found to produce bacteriocins, proteins that kill or inhibit
the growth of other bacteria, and this propensity has led to much interest in the use of
Carnobacteria species as a probiotic in aquaculture (Robertson, 2000).
When fish are physiologically stressed, however, they become more prone to
infection (Herman et al., 1985), and Carnobacteria can become septicemic and damage
the kidneys, liver, and brain <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Baya : Exact'>(Baya</span> et al., 1991). Hui et al. (1984) cultured Carnobacteria
sp. (then still in the Lactobacillus genus) from diseased rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and
Chinook salmon, all from fish that had been stressed by handling or by spawning activity.
Carnobacteria has been shown to cause mortalities in stressed cultured fish challenged
with the bacteria (Baya et al., 1991).
Carnobacteria have not been reported as normal flora in sharks, and this is the
first report of Carnobacteria pathogenesis in any shark species. Identifying the bacteria
at the species level would aid greatly in understanding the epidemiology of this infection.
Once the bacteria is identified, the route of infection may be pinpointed as environmental,
dietary, or congenital in future research.
Methods
Bacteria were isolated from four infected salmon shark brains and were cultured
by Dr. Barry Lifland of the Stanford University Comparative Medicine Department.
Liquid cultures were prepared for PCR analysis.
Primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Carnol6sF (5’-
ATACATGCAAGTCGAACGC-3’) and Carnol6sR (5’¬
ATAAATCCGGACAACGCTTGCCA-3’) were custom designed to amplify a -500 bp
region of the Carnobacterium 16s ribosomal DNA gene for analysis. CarnolTS-F (5’-
TGGTTCGAGTCCATTTAGGCCCA-3’) and CarnolTS-R (5’¬
CTTACAGCTCCCCAAAGCATAT-3’) were custom designed to amplify a region of the
large intergenic spacer region determined by Kabadjova (2002) to differentiate between
C. piscicola, mobile, divergens, and gallinarum.
PCR reactions were carried out in 25 uL volumes containing 18 uL ddH2O, 2.5 uL
PCR buffer, 2.5 uL 0.8 umol dNTP, 0.5 uL of each primer, 0.06 uL of AmpliTag (WHO),
and 1 uL of bacterial liquid culture. Denaturation was at 94 °C for 1.5 minutes.
Successful annealing temperatures for Carno 16sF and Carno l6sR ranged from 53.8 °C to
59.7 °C, maintained for 30s. Extension was performed at 72 °C for 1 minute, and the
cycle was carried out 33x. For ITS amplification, the cycle was 94 °C for 30 seconds,
59.5 °C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 °C for 1 minute, carried out 33x.
Completed PCR reactions were screened on 1.5% agarose gels for successful
amplification. To remove ssDNA and primers from the PCR reactions and make the
amplified DNA inert, SAP/EXO reactions were performed in 7 uL volumes containing
0.5 uL of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) enzyme, 0.5 uL of Exonuclease, 0.25 uL
SAP buffer, and 5 uL of PCR template buffer per reaction. The reaction was carried out
at 37 °C for 30 minutes and then the enzymes were denatured at 80 °C for 15 minutes.
Sequences of 16s and ISR were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain
termination method. Both forward and reverse sequencing reactions were carried for l6s
and ITS sequencing in 10 uL volumes with 6 uL ddH2O, 1.5 uL 5x buffer, 1 uL Big Dye,
0.5 uL of either forward or reverse primer, and 1 uL of SAP/EXÖ template. The product
DNA was precipitated with 40 uL of 75% isopropanol per reaction. The reaction tubes
were centrifuged for 1 hour at - 3600 rpm, and were then spun upside down for 1 minute
at 700 rpm to remove the isopropanol. The pelleted DNA of was then resuspended in 20
uL of Hi Dye, denatured for 2 minutes at 96 °C, and inserted into an ABI 3100 Genetic
Analyzer. Forward and reverse sequences were edited by eye and the consensus
sequences were sent to GenBank to garner initial similarities. The consensus sequences
were aligned with known Carnobacterium species 16s and ISR sequences. Using
ClustalW, PAUP was used to create neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees comparing the
amplified sequences to sequences from known Carnobacterium spp.
Results
PCR with primers Carnol6sF and Carno l6sR amplified a region of-541 base
pairs that was identical to all samples, and nearly identical to the 16s rDNA of C.
piscicola and to a recently examined species from the Arctic, Carnobacterium sp Arctic
P-2 (Lee et al., 2004 unpublished data) (Fig. 1). The sole difference from C. piscicola is
a single base pair insertion in the C. piscicola sequence that is absent in the sequence
from our bacteria. The sole difference from the Arctic species is a single base change.
The 16s isolate sequence clusters with C. piscicola and the Arctic species (Fig. 2).
PCR with CarnolTS-F and CarnolTS-R yielded a piece of-540 base pairs. All of
the sequences obtained from bacterial culture were 100% homologous to each other. The
consensus sequence was not, however, identical to any Carnobacterium spp. in GenBank
(Fig. 3). The isolate sequence clustered with C. piscicola, but is only 92% homologous
to C. piscicola, and is no more closely related to any other Carnobacterium species in
GenBank (Fig. 4).
Discussion
The 16s and ITS sequence data indicate that the bacteria isolated from the four
individual sharks are identical, though the sharks were from separate beaching events
geographically and temporally. Of these four, the southernmost beaching was at Sunset
Beach in Orange County, and the northernmost was Bodega Bay in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sonoma : Exact'>Sonoma</span> County, CA.
One shark had beached in August 2002, while the other three were from 2003.
Since 16s sequences from species within the Carnobacteria genus generally share
97-98% or more homology (Genbank comparisons), the 16s sequence from our isolate,
which is more than 99% homologous to C. piscicola and averages about 98% homology
to other Carnobacteria species, confirms the biochemical and serological findings that
place this isolate within the Carnobacteria. The ITS data indicate that the bacterial
isolate is significantly different, however, from any currently known species of
Carnobacteria. Interspecific ITS variation within the Carnobacteria is approximately 4-
7% (GenBank comparisons). Our isolate is 8% different from C. piscicola, its closest
matching relative. Our isolate may prove to be the recently described arctic species C.
sp. Arctic P-2, the large intergenetic spacer region of which has not yet been sequenced,
or it may be an entirely new species within the Carnobacteria.
It could be that the young sharks, like many wild and cultured fish, carry
Carnobacteria naturally in their gut or on their gill surfaces. Though this particular
isolate has not yet been described from other fish species, colonization of the gut may
occur via the salmon shark diet, which in the adults consists primarily of salmonid fish
known to carry Carnobacteria species. If the sharks harbor this Carnobacteria isolate
naturally and then encounter stressful conditions along northern California, the bacteria
may proliferate and infect the brain, causing disorientation and beaching. The infections
may be peculiar to salmon shark juveniles due to some unique behavior or aspect of the
juvenile life history, such as coastal migration, not shared by the adults or other species.
Alternatively, since salmon sharks are ovoviviparous, the young sharks could
contract the bacteria at birth, if their mothers are infected. Adult salmon sharks may be
affected with the bacterial meningitis, and may simply beach in areas that aren’t heavily
accessed by the public, since these sharks inhabit the northern Pacific where coastal
communities are less frequent. Or perhaps the pelagic adult life prevents sick individuals
from beaching on shore where they would be found.
Why other sharks are unaffected by this bacterial meningoencephalitis is not
clear. If exposure to the bacteria comes through the diet, then other shark species that
prey on salmonid fishes, herring, or any other piscine species known to harbor
Carnobacteria, should be affected. Yet no species other than salmon sharks have been
observed to beach as regularly or as predictably as salmon sharks do.
Conclusion
An unusual Carnobacterium spp. has been isolated from the brains of beached
salmon sharks suffering from acute meningoencephalitis with intralesional bacteria. The
isolates share 100% homology with each other at both the 16s and large ITS regions. The
isolates do not match with any known Carnobacteria species known to Genbank, but
cluster most closely to C. piscicola, and an isolate from the Arctic, C. spp P-2. The
epidemiology of this disease will be understood with further investigation into the
identity and natural habitat of the isolate, and the lifestyle of juvenile and adult salmon
sharks.
