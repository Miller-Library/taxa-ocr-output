in Fig. 4. The change observed in low M. californianus was significant (p = 0.014)
whereas the change observed in high mussels was not (p = 0.126)
3.2. Malate dehydrogenase activity
The activity average for freshly collected high mussels (n = 5) was 40.088 + 1.44
umoles OAA min" g wet wt. Average for fresh low mussels (n = 5) was 34.032 + 2.35
umol OAA min" gâ€™ wet wt. Similar to respiration rate averages, these were not
significantly different (p = 0.059). (Fig. 5)
Over time, MDH activities also showed acclimatory changes. High mussels
showed a significant (p = 0.048) decrease in activity during the 25 days they were held.
An insignificant (p = 0.147) increase in activity, however, was noted in low mussels. See
Fig. 6.
3.3. Respiration rates vs. MDH Activity
When plotted against each other (Fig. 7) oxygen consumption rates and enzyme
activity results showed that MDH was not a good predictor of aerobic metabolic rate.
4. Discussion
The design of this experiment led to acclimation by Mytilus californianus, which
confounded the results and did not allow me to conclusively answer the question of
whether or not a metabolic difference exists between low and high intertidal mussel
populations. Rather, this experiment strongly suggested that M. californianus is a plastic
organism capable of modifying its physiology over a period of 25 days in response to
environmental factors. This experimental design artifact resulted in small sample sizes of
freshly collected organisms, which may explain the non-significant differences between
