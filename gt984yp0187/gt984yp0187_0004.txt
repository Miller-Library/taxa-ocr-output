also a quicker and more efficient method because one does not have to wait for mussels
to gape.
Respiration was measured in a sealed, water-jacketed respirometer at 15°C using
excised gill tissue. An oxygen sensitive electrode was attached to a Powerlab unit that
allowed for collection and analyses of data on a computer.
Each respiration run was began by assembling the chamber, which consisted of a
stirbar, platform, and mesh pieces (used to hold gill tissue in place). The chamber was
rinsed with filtered seawater (FSW) containing 15 mg of Penicillin G and 15 mg
Streptomyocin per liter and then filled to capacity with more FSW. The system was
allowed to thermally equilibrate. Meanwhile, calibration of the electrode took place.
Dissection of the mussel gill was done as follows: the bivalve was opened by cutting
the anterior and posterior adductor muscles, followed by carefully cutting and removing
the gills from both valves. These were then placed in a petri dish filled with FSW
containing antibiotics and washed twice with FSW. One gill was transferred to a beaker
of FSW and placed in a water bath at 15°C. The other gill was kept in FSW on ice for use
later in the enzymatic analysis.
Once the chamber had reached 15°C it was purged of any air bubbles present. The
gill tissue was carefully placed inside the mesh attached to the platform, making sure that
the gill was securely in place. Not doing so resulted in the gill floating up and touching
the electrode tip, which interfered with the electrode's measuring capability. The
chamber was filled to the point of overflow and any newly introduced bubbles were
removed. The lid was then placed on the chamber and screwed in place. It was important
