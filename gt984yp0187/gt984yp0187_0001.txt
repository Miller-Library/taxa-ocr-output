Abstract
In this study I examined metabolic rates of Mytilus californianus located at the
upper and lower extremes of the Mytilus distribution zone in an exposed rocky intertidal
area at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA. Mussels high in the zone spend less
time exposed to normoxic conditions as a result of longer emersion periods. They also
experience greater temperature fluctuations. Such abiotic stresses were expected to make
metabolic rates among high and low mussels different. Respiration (O2 consumption) and
malate dehydrogenase activities of gill tissue were used as indicators of metabolism. The
design of this experiment led to mussel acclimation over a period of 25 days. When
plotted against time, enzyme activities of low mussels showed a significant (p = 0.048
decrease in activity. Additionally, a significant (p = 0.014) decrease was observed in O,
consumption of high mussels. The unexpectedly rapid physiological plasticity shown by
M. californianus resulted in small sample sizes (enzyme n = 10, respiration n = 4) of
freshly collected individuals, which may have contributed to the non-significant
differences seen in high and low mussel MDH activities (p = 0.059) and respiration rates
(p = 0.74). It was also concluded from this experiment that MDH activity is not a good
predictor of respiration rate, possibly due to its role in both aerobic and anaerobic
metabolism.
