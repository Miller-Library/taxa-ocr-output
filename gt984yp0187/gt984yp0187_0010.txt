decrease in the enzymeâ€™s activity because the need for generating ATP anaerobically is
reduced. This is what was indeed observed.
The preceding argument that MDH activities measured in this experiment were
largely activities of anaerobic metabolism would also explain why such poor correlation
was seen between respiration rates and enzyme activities.
In the future I think it would be interesting to repeat this experiment using a larger
number of freshly collected samples from more than one site to control for any possible
location factors. It may also be interesting to use entire mussels for respiration
measurements as opposed to only gill tissue. Perhaps doing a long-term study would
reveal seasonal variation in these two M. californianus populations. Another possible
experiment would be to use an enzyme involved only in aerobic metabolism, such as
citrate synthase. Finally, I think it is worth designing an experiment in which mussels are
exposed to abnormally long periods of emersion and heat stress and then tested for MDH
activities. This would show whether or not MDH activity measurements in Mytilus
californianus are actually from anaerobic metabolism.
5. Conclusions
This experiment illustrated that Mytilus californianus is a physiologically plastic
organism capable of altering its metabolic rate over a period of 25 days, as shown by a
decreasing respiration rate in laboratory-acclimated mussels from low sites in the
intertidal zone, and a decrease in MDH activity in laboratory-acclimated high organisms
The results did not, however, indicate metabolic rate differences between freshly
