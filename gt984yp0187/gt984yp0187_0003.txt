periods, compensate by having bursts of aerobic metabolism when exposed to normoxic
conditions (submerged). A second possibility is that low mussels are exposed to a richer
source of nutrients and maintain a metabolic rate that is higher than that of mussels living
higher in the distribution zone. Lack of literature and similar studies, however, made it
difficult to give either scenario, or any other, more credibility. Consequently, the
hypothesis here states only that metabolic rates of high and low mussels would be
different. The indices of metabolic rate measured were respiration (O2 consumption) and
activity of the enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH).
2. Materials & Methods
2.1. Animals
Mussels (Mytilus californianus) were first collected on May 8", 2001 from a
northwest facing rocky intertidal site at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA.
Approximately fifty mussels, 50 to 60 mm in length, were obtained from the upper and
lower extreme at which M. californianus is found at that particular location. A second set
of 8 samples of the same size was taken on the 26" of May from the same location.
Shortly after sampling, the organisms were placed in large holding tanks with
continuously flowing fresh seawater.
2.2. Experimental procedure
Oxygen consumption rate was chosen because it is a good indicator of
metabolism and has been used in previous studies (Babarro et al. 2000). A modification
in this study was that dissected gill tissue was used instead of the entire organism. This
was done because mussel gills have been found to continue respiring after removal. It is
