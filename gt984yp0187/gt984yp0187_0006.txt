Malate dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at
15°C. The first step involved preparing a cocktail containing 50 ml of 200 mM imidazole
buffer (pH 7.0 % 20°C), 0.0054 g NADH (final conc. = 0.15 mM), and 0.0014 g OAA
(final conc. = 0.2 mM). This cocktail was prepared daily and kept on ice throughout the
experiment because NADH and OAA degrade over time. The gill tissue was then
weighed wet, minced, and homogenized in a five-fold dilution of 200 mM imidazole
buffer. Finally, the homogenate was transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at
14,000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Spectrophotometer readings were taken using cuvettes filled with 2 mL of
cocktail. To initiate the reactions, homogenate samples were transferred into cuvettes
with a 25 uL Lang-Levy pipette. Reaction data were recorded for 30 seconds. Five
replicates were taken for each sample of tissue.
2.4. Calculations and statistics
Respirometry readings were converted from slopes describing decreases in O2
concentration over time to umol O2s g" wet wt. However, only the set of data points
from 10 to 30 minutes were used. The reason for using only these data was that the first
10 minutes usually gave high values that were inconsistent with the rest of the data.
Control slopes (10 to 20 minute data points) were first subtracted from experimental
slopes and then converted using the equation:
(chamber volume) * (A O2 concentration/100) * (O2 solubility) = X umol O2;s
This value was then divided by the wet weight of the gill tissue.
MDH results were standardized from A Absorbance/min to umoles OAA
converted to malate per minute per gram of wet tissue. The first step was to convert A
