Absorbance/min to units of activity, which equals (A Absorbance/min * 2.0)/6.22. The
value of 2.0 represents the amount of cocktail placed in the cuvette and 6.22 is the
micromolar extinction coefficient for NADH. This value was then divided by the wet
weight of the gill tissue, which had been homogenized in a 5X dilution of buffer. This
meant that in every mL of homogenate there was 0.2 g of tissue (it was assumed that a
gram of tissue had a volume of 1 mL). Because 25 uL of homogenate were added to each
cuvette, every reaction had a total of 0.005 g of tissue. Thus, activity values were divided
by this value. To obtain final values for a given gill, the five replicate values were
averaged.
Respiration rates and enzymatic activities of freshly collected high and low
mussels were compared using one-way ANÃ–VA tests. Values of mussels that had been
placed in holding tanks for more than one day were graphed over time and the resulting
slopes were tested to see if they were significantly different from a slope of O. All
calculations were done using Microsoft Excel.
3. Results
3.1. Respiration rate
Freshly collected low M. californianus (n = 2) had oxygen consumption rates with
an average of 0.00141 + 0.00027 umol O2 sec" g" wet wt. (mean + S.E.M.), while
freshly collected high mussels (n = 2) had an average of 0.00126 + 0.00029 umol O2 sec
gwet wt. These averages were not significantly different (p = 0.74). (Fig. 3)
During the 25 days of the experiment, low and high mussels held in tanks with
continuous flowing seawater exhibited a decrease in oxygen consumption, as can be seen
