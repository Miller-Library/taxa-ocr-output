1. Introduction
The rocky intertidal forms a variable environment where many specialized and
diverse species thrive. Abiotic stresses such as tides, wave splash and impact, desiccation,
food availability, and temperature establish steep gradients that affect how and where
different organisms can survive in this highly variable macro-habitat (Denny 1988). As a
result, intertidal species inhabit discrete vertical zones. Biochemical and physiological
processes have been shown to vary between congeneric species and even between distinct
conspecific populations residing at different heights (Pickens 1965, Hofmann & Somero
1995, Stillman & Somero 1996, Tomanek & Somero 2000).
The purpose of this experiment was to further explore the relationship between
physiology and vertical zonation in intertidal organisms. The experimental subject chosen
was a sessile species, Mytilus californianus. It is a common prey for predatory animals
(e.g. Pisaster ochraceous), making it a central species in community dynamics. Its range
extends from the Aleutian Islands southward to Baja California and the species is usually
found in the mid-intertidal zone of exposed coasts. Because of its mid-intertidal location,
populations of M. californianus living at the lower extreme of the vertical zone are
usually emersed only once a day during low tide. Conversely, individuals inhabiting the
upper region experience long emersion periods, rarely being entirely submerged. Thus,
upper mussels are more likely exposed to abiotic stresses such as desiccation, high
temperature, and hypoxia.
The physiology of high and low mussels was expected to differ as a result of the
different environmental conditions in their microhabitats. One possible scenario was that
high individuals, which have less time to feed and respire as a result of longer emersion
