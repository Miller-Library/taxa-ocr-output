to make sure no air bubbles were present because they could have oxygenated the water
resulting in erred measurements.
The electrode was secured in place and recording was begun. Each gill tissue was
measured for 30 minutes and then the wet weight of the gill was determined. Äfter the
gill was removed, the chamber was refilled with FSW and resealed to quantify
background respiration by bacteria. Control run measurements were recorded for 20
minutes.
Every day the chamber was cleaned with a 10% bleach solution for 10 minutes.
Any remaining bleach was deactivated with a 1% sodium thiosulfate solution. All parts
were rinsed with deionized water and laid out to dry overnight.
2.3. Analysis
Activities of MDH were measured because it is a simple enzyme to assay. This
was an important consideration due to time constraints. There are limitations, however, to
the use of MDH because it is an indicator of aerobic and anaerobic ATP generating
capacity. See Figures 1 and 2 for the specific role of MDH in both metabolic pathways
Therefore, the results obtained from MDH were closely examined and plotted against
respiration rates to see if indeed this enzyme was a good aerobic metabolic indicator.
The reaction MDH catalyzes is:
Oxaloacetatic acid + NADH + H — Malate + NAD
Although the substrate is oxaloacetic acid (OAA), the conversion of NADH to NAD is
actually what was measured over time. The reason for this is that these two compounds
have very different absorbances at 340 nm. Therefore, they provide a good means by
which to perform a colorimetric assay.
