low and high mussels. The results for fresh high (n = 5) and low (n = 5) mussel MDH
activity were very close to being significant (p = 0.059). It is important to note, however,
that because both indicators of metabolic activity showed significant convergences over
time it is only logical that an initial difference exists between low and high M.
californianus populations.
The observed decrease in oxygen consumption rate of low mussels indicates a
decline in metabolic rate. A speculative, yet logical, explanation for this observation is
that low M. californianus were removed from their natural habitats, where they are
normally submerged and exposed to a rich source of nutrients, and placed in holding
tanks where food may have been less. This conjecture is supported by Dahlhoff and
Mengeâ€™s (1996) finding that near shore food availability is strongly correlated to
metabolic activity. Their results showed that mussels living at a wave-exposed site with
relatively high phytoplankton concentrations had higher citrate synthase and MDH
activities than organisms living at a wave-protected site with low phytoplankton
concentrations.
As explained in the introduction, MDH is involved in aerobic as well as anaerobic
metabolism. The results attained in this experiment seem to be better explained by the
enzyme's role in anaerobiosis. Because high mussels have longer emersion periods they
also have longer time spans in which they must close their valves to prevent desiccation.
This forces high organisms to switch over to anaerobic metabolism for extended periods
of time, resulting in a reliance on MDH for producing ATP under oxygen-limited
conditions. Thus, when high M. californianus are placed in an environment where they
are continuously submerged, as it was in the holding tanks, one would expect to see a
