Ammonia excretion in A. elegantissima.
Peter T. Hetzler
INTRODUCTION.
Most marine invertebrates are ammonotelic, that is,
they excrete ammonia as the major end product of their pro¬
tein catabolism. Coelenterates appear to be no exception.
Delaunay (1934) states that Actinians excrete 52.7% of their
nitrogenous waste as ammonia, but through what pathways and
by what enzymes has not been elucidated. The findings pre¬
sented in this paper suggest that the sea anemone, A. elegan-
tissima (Brandt, 1835), is ammonotelic as expected, and that
two of the steps leading to ammonia excretion in this an¬
imal are catalyzed by enzymes commonly involved in amino acid
degredation.
MATERIALS.
All anemones were taken from the low intertidal zone
at the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California.
Large solitary animals, symbiotized by zooxanthellae, were
used as the source of all enzyme preparations. The symbi¬
otic and "aposymbiotic" anemones used in the feeding experi¬
ment were clonal and only members taken from the same two
clones were used. Animals selected as aposymbiotic, howev¬
er, were found to contain small populations of zooxanthellae.
METHODS.
Ammonia was measured by the method of Solorzano (1964)
except that all reagent additions were one half the volume,
and only 1 ml. of sample was used. Deammoniated water was
used as adiluent. 10 mls. of IN NaOH was added to 1 liter
of distilled water. The solution was brought to a
