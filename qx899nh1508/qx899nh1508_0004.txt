Ammonia excretion in A. elegantissima.
Peter T. Hetzler
for activity in the absence of substrate the maximum rate
of ammonia release is O.13 ug NH/minute for extracts pre¬
pared using 0.2 grams of acetone powder in 9 mls. of buffer.
Thereafter, the ammonia concentration decreases at a rate of
0.04 ug NHa/minute. The general features of the time course
of ammonia generation was observed in all assays with this
preparation. The total amount of ammonia released is equi¬
valent to one half the amount present in the substrate level
of DL-alanine used in the assay.

DISCUSSION.
The feeding experiment suggests that the endosymbiotic
zooxanthellae of A. elegantissima take up the ammonia released
by the animal. These results support the observations of
Trench (1971) who found in the coral, Porites divaricata,
that 50% more C alanine was synthetized by zooxanthellae
during photosynthetic assimilation of C carbonate when
NH,Cl was added to the medium. Futher replications of the
feeding experiments are necessary to asses the signifi¬
cance of ammonia assimilation by the zooxanthellae in A.
elegantissima. It must be remembered that the lighter colored
animals selected as "aposymbiotic" have been found to con¬
tain small populations of zooxanthellae.
The enzymatic catabolism of alanine in the extracts of
A. elegantissima resulted in only one half the amount of am-
monia available from the substrate level of DL-alanine which
suggests that the enzyme in question is specific for either
the Dor the L isomer. The much lower level of ammonia re-
