Ammonia excretion in A. elegantissima.

FIGURE CAPTIONS.
Figure 1.
THE FEEDING EXPERIMENT. Four specimens of
A. elegantissima were fed (0) and four
were not (9). The animals were fed O.07
grams, wet weight, of squid at time 0. The
fed anemones released markedly greater a-
mounts of ammonia than the starved anemones,
especially the "aposymbiotic"animal in the
dark. Note the decrease in ammonia concen¬
tration after 180 minutes in all fed anemones.
Figure 2.
Figure 2 shows the release of ammonia in the
acetone powder extracts of A. elegantissima.
Note that the ammonia concentration in all
three assays reaches a maximum level at 15
minutes and sharply decreases thereafter.
The low ammonia concentration levels in the
absence ofaketoglutarate suggests that the
ammonia release is not due to an alanine ami¬
no oxidase reaction but to an L-alanine ami¬
dotransferase reaction coupled with a glu¬
tamic dehydrogenase reaction.
