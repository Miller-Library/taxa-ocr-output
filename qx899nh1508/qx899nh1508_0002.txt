Ammonia excretion in A. elegantissima.
boil, cooled to room temperature, and 10 mls. of IN HCI
was added.The method was used in the range from 0.6 to
Aug NH./ml. Measurements were made using a Klett-Sumerson
Photoelectric Colorimeter with a red filter against a re-
agent blank. The method was reproducible within 6%.
Enzyme preparations were obtained either by homo-
genization in deammoniated water or from imidazole buffer
extracts of acetone powders. Acetone powders were pre¬
pared as follows. 500 mls. of redistilled acetone kept at
0°C. was added to 50 mls. of anemone in a Waring Blendor,
macerated at high speed for 1 minute, and filtered through
Whatman No. 5 filter paper on a Buchner funnel with suc-
tion. The residue was washed twice with 500 ml. volumes
of chilled acetone on the filter. When the filter cake
had completely dried, it was pulverized with mortar and
pestle to give a fine power and stored at 0°0. 9 mls. of
O.5M Imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, was added to 0.2 grams
of this powder and the mixture was centrifuged in a re¬
frigerated International Centrifuge, PR-4. Essentially
no activity was associated with the sedimented pellet.
The resulting extract was purified by gel filtration us¬
ing Sephadex, G25.
Enzyme activity was assayed as follows. Glutamine
synthetase activity was measured in terms of the y-glu¬
tamyl transfer reaction as described by Rowe, et. al.
(1970). The release of ammonia from DL-alanine was mea-
sured using 0.235 umoles DL-alanine and  ketogluterate
at the same concentration; in,a total volume of 5 mls.
