leased in the absence of d ketoglutarate suggests that the
ammonia release is not due to a D or an L alanine oxidase,
but occurs via a transferase reaction. In all cases in¬
vestigated, the L amino acids are more susceptible to cat¬
abolism. Futhermore, there is no report in the literature
of a D-alanine amidotransferase. It is highly likely,
therefore, that the observed activity is caused by an L¬
alanine amidotransferase coupled with a glutamic dehy¬
drogenase.
The uptake of ammonia by another enzyme system with
synthesis of other amino acids might cause the sharp drop
in ammonia concentration after 15 minutes. Attempts at
identification of such other products by chromatography have
been unsuccessful to date. The source of the ammonia as¬
similating enzymes has not been elucidated. The relative
importance of the contributions of enzymes from the anem¬
one and zooxanthellae must still be assessed in charac¬
terizing this system.
SUMMARY.
1. Fed specimens of the sea anemone, Anthopleura el¬
egantissima, excrete more ammonia than starved
specimens, suggesting that A. elegantissima is
ammonotelic as expected.
2. Preliminary findings suggest that the endosym-
biotic zooxanthellae present in A. elegantissima
take up ammonia excreted by the animal.
3. Two steps leading to the excretion of ammonia in
