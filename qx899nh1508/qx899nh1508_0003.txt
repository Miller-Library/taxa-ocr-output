Ammonia excretion in A. elegantissima.
of which 0.5 ml. was 1M potassium phosphate buffer, pH
7.3, and 1 ml. was enzyme solution. The volume of the mix¬
ture was then brought to 5 mls. with deammoniated water.
Appropriate controls were used in all assays. The mix¬
tures were incubated at 37°C. and sampled at intervals
for periods up to twolhours. Replicate samples were ta¬
ken at each sample time.
Four symbiotic and four "aposymbiotic" anemones
varying from 0.8 to 1.2 grams dry weight, which had been
starved for two months,were used in the feeding experiment.
Only two of each type were fed 0.07 grams, wet weight, of
squid. One fed and not fed of each type was placed in
the light and the dark in 80 mls. of Instant Ocean and
maintained at ambient seawater temperature, between 10.5
and 12°0. Samples of the water were taken for ammonia de-
termination at intervals for four hours after feeding.
RESULTS.
The results of the feeding experiment (Table 1 and
Figure 1) show that ammonia excretion is markedly in¬
creased after feeding. The levels of excreted ammonia were
decreased on prolonged incubation as can be seen in Fig¬
ure 1.
No evidence for the existence of glutamine synthe¬
tase was found in either type of enzyme preparation. How¬
ever, the L-alanine amidotransferase experiment did show
significant activity. The results appear in Table 2 and
in Figure 2. Note that the ammonia released is maximum at
15 minutes in all three enzyme assays. After correction
