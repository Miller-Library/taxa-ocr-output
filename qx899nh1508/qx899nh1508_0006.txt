Ammonia excretion in A. elegantissima.
Peter T. Hetzler
SUMMARY (continued).
A. elegantissima are catalyzed by an L-alanine
amidotransferase coupled with a glutamic de-
hydrogenase.
4. The level of ammonia released during the course
of the L-alanine amidotransferase reaction
reaches a maximum at 15 minutes at a rate of
0.13 ug NH/minute, and thereafter decreases
sharply at a rate of 0.04 ug NHa/minute. This
decrease can not be attributed to a glutamine
synthetase reaction.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr.
John H. Phillips whose profound knowledge and patience
were invaluable during the course of this project. I
would also like to thank Phil Murphy for his advice and
assistance. Special thanks go to the students and the rest
