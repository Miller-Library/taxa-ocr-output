<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phragmatopoma californica : Exact'>Phragmatopoma californica</span> is a suspension feeding
polychaete of the family <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sabellariidae : Exact'>Sabellariidae.</span> It is a common
species in California, forming massive reefs (Smith and
Carlton, 1975). Members of this family live in tubes that
they construct from sand and shell fragments. The anterior
end of these tubes increases in diameter to give a flared
terminus. Clusters of these flares result in the colonies
having a beehive appearance. Thus, these worms are often
referred to as the honeycomb worms.
Except for studies by Roy (1974) which dealt primarily
with activities of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. californica</span> within its tube, the
observations of this paper are new with respect to forma-
tion of the flared terminus of the tubes by this species.

flares that occupy approximately 180 degrees of the tube
diameter. For a number of reasons, flares also commonly
deviate from 180 degrees. The flares usually project
farthest in the middle and taper towards the sides.
Initial inspection of many colonies makes it appear that
organization of the flare is random. Further investigation
of flares within colonies reveals them to be oriented often
in the same direction. Preliminary field observation and
experimentation demonstrated that when the flares were
scraped off they were usually rebuilt within twelve hours
and in the same direction as previous ones. Worms could
rebuild their flares in one or more differing directions
placed in new locations. Other early
when colonies were
field observations seemed to show that colonies tended to
orient away from strong flows of current. However, colonies
maintained in aquaria after their flares had been removed
were seen to rebuild towards a relatively weak current.
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that certain
environmental factors influence the construction and
direction of flares by Phragmatopoma californica. It will
(3)
also try to determine the role that predominating currents
might play in flare formation.
Materials and Methods:
Experiments were carried out on colonies of Phragmatopoma
californica obtained from the rocky intertidal between
Point Cabrillo and Point Allones, Pacific Grove, California.
Field studies were conducted in the area from which
colonies were collected. This area runs southwest to
northeast into the ocean, and has <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. californica colonies</span>
extending approximately from the +3.3 foot to the -3.0 foot
tide level. It is surrounded by sand on either side. The
area is semiexposed and subject to a fair amount of wave
action. The P. californica colonies are mainly located on
rocks.
Laboratory experiments took place at Hopkins Marine
Station. They consisted of simulated field situations with
directed current in both indoor aquaria and an outdoor
pool equipped with a submersible pump.
When flare removal was required this was done simply
(4)
by scraping the face of the colony with a straight edged
instrument.
Experimental and Results:
Some Environmental Effects on Flare Construction
A large colony, about 1 m by 1.5 m, was located for
experimentation. The colony appeared as an orderly array
of individual tubes,
extending almost vertically from the
upper surface of a rock. Flares were generally oriented
facing southwest (Figure 1A).
Portions of the colony were separated and their flares
scraped off. These segments of no less than 15 worms were
placed in a triangular, wire cage having its bottom at the
-0.1 foot tide level (Fig. 10). They were positioned so that
the side that had been nearest land was now adjacent to a
cage wall and with the same flare orientation (Fig. 1A).
The subcolonies were kept in place by being wrapped in a
wire screen which was fastened to the cage.
Worms were left in the cage for 24 to 48 hours, time
enough for the building of new flares. Following this time
(5)
interval the subcolonies were then removed and the new
flare angle was measured with a protractor (Fig.riB).

The entire procedure was then repeated, replacing the worms
in a new cage location.
A t-test for two independent samples revealed P.
californica to have changed flare direction to a.07
level of significance in three out of four field tests. All
cases of significant change took place when a colony was
moved from the front of the cage, facing the sea, to the
back, facing land, or vice versa.
ruction in Different Degrees of Current
Flare Cons
A regularly organized colony of Phragmatopoma californ-
ica was obtained from the intertidal and brought into the
laboratory. The colony was divided into six segments of
no less than ten worms each. These pieces were placed at
no more than 33 cm. interval with wooden blocks positioned
between them. Any open spaces were filled with modeling
clay so as to create a smooth, solid surface on which the
colonies were facing. The pieces were positioned so that
they all pointed in the same direction (Fig. 24). The
(6)

entire apparatus was placed in a large circulating sea-
water tank with a pump positioned so that a decreasing
current ran down its face. Sand, obtained from Aggassiz
Beach, was dispersed at the pump outlet so that it would
be carried in front of the worms. The current was measured
in meters/second by timing the passage of methylene blue
dyed seawater through a one meter tube, having an inner
diameter of 3.3 centimeters, with its opening at the front of
each surface in question.
The worms were left for 40 hours then removed. Flare
angles were recorded (Fig. 2B). The flares were then re-
moved and the entire apparatus replaced, but with a 180
degree turn so that the colonies were now upside down
relative to their previous position (Fig. 2B). When flares
were again measured the same polar axis was used as in the
first trial. The reason for this was that the major con-
cern was whether the flare was oriented towards or against
the oncoming current. For example, in both cases a flare
measuring greater than O degrees and less than 90 degrees
was directed towards the current. In Trial I it would be
located on the upper left hand side of the tube with the
current coming from the right, while in Trial II it would
be located on the lower right hand side with current coming
from the left.
There appeared to be no correlation between the flare
angle and current velocity (Table 2). A t-test for two
independent samples showed only one subcolony to have
changed their flare angles significantly from Trial I to
Trial II (Table 3).


Discussion:

Studies conducted in the field and in the laboratory
show that in some instances colonies of Phragmatopoma
californica will change the direction of their flares. A
significant change among field cases took place when sub-
colonies initially facing the ocean were turned to face
land and vice versa. In all of these examples flares were
directed farther away from a 90 degree angle when colonies
were facing the sea. It may be that the incoming wave
action exerted a maximum, detrimental effect on the worms
when flares were at this angle. Bendimg the flares to the
(8)
left or right may have lessened the force of waves and thus
provided some protection for the worms.
Subcolonies not changing flare direction were those
that were moved from facing land to facing the side of the
cage, or were in the circulating pool. These results may
indicate that colonies of P. californica tend not to change
the position of their flares and will only do so when
absolutely necessary. The worms maintaining their origin-
al flare orientation may not have had an environmental shift
stressful enough to require any change.
Preliminary observations indicated that worms placed
in a fast current may try to protect themselves by using
their flares as a shield, while those in a slower current
which direct their flare towards the flow may be doing so
to increase their chances of catching food particles. Lab-
oratory attempts to correlate the strength of current with
the direction of the flare proved inconclusive. It may have
been that the range of currents tested was not sufficient
to warrant change of flare position. It would be interest-
ing to see if one placed a colony in two extreme current
(9)
velocities and cause a change in flare orientation from
facing a current to opposing the current.
The two colonies in the pool which built no flares
during the first trial may not have done so because the
water movement was too forceful to allow them to extend
their tentacles and catch the sand particles necessary for
flare construction. It may also have been that the sand was
not suspended for a long enough time in front of the worms
to allow it to be seized.
Additional field observations bring to attention the
possible function of the flare in retaining water. P.
californica was seen only to extend its tentacles when in an
aqueous environment. When colonies which had half of their
flares shaved off were observed while the tide was coming
in, it was noted that the worms with flares, unlike
those lacking them, were able to keep their tentacles ex-
tended for a longer period of time after waves had washed
over them. The reason for this appeared to be that the
flares were able to hold water for short periods of time
after the major run off had occurred.

Summary:
1. Colonies of Phragmatopoma californica rebuilt their
flares in the same direction if unmoved.
2. Colonies of P. californica were observed to
occasionally change the orientation of their flares in the
field.
3. It appeared that currents may dictate flare con-
struction, strong currents causing flares to oppose them
and weak currents causing flares to face them.
4. A speculated use for the flare may be in water
retention, allowing tentacles to be used.
