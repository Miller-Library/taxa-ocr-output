Polycheria osborni has been found to occur in a much greater
variety of ascidian hosts than previously recorded. Observations
on distribution of Polycheria osborni in different ascidian species,
in relation to the zooids, and the length of time for burrowing
in different ascidians suggests some reasons for the distribution
to be as it is. No Polycheria osborni burrowed into Archidistoma
psammion and none were found around China Point burrowed into
this ascidian. However, two were found burrowed into Archidistoma
psammion at Pescadero Point. This ascidian is very tough when
pressed on. It is possible that this hardness creates a major
barrier for this animal which is going to simply pull with its
pereopods and push with its back to make a burrow. Several of the
other ascidians looked at but found lacking in Polycheria osborni
are encrusted with sand which would make it virtually impossible
for Polycheria osborni to catch hold of the surface membrane to
pull itself into a burrow. Polyclinum planum which had a medium
density of Polycheria osborni in the field and into which only
half the experimental animals burrowed into may also be firm enough
to present some barrier to Polycheria osborni.
Behavior of Polycheria osborni in its burrow.
Studies were made to determine how much of the time the Poly-
cheria osborni spend holding their burrows closed, holding their
burrows open, or holding their burrows open while kicking their
pleopods. Ten minute observations were carried out on 13 Polycheria
osborni in 3 different ascidian species. An event recorder coupled
with a strip chart recorder was used to keep records of when the
animals closed their burrows, when they opened them, and when
they kicked their pleopods. From these records, total duration
for each activity in the 10 minute period could be obtained,
