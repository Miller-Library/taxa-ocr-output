Eleven species of colonial ascidians from the Bird Rock and
Seal Rock areas were examined for the presence of Polycheria osborni.
Four of these (Archidistoma psammion, Synoicum parfustus, Aplidium
solidum and Perophora annectens) contained no amphipods. Two more
(Distaplia occidentalis and Clavelina huntsmani) contained only
occasional amphipods. The five species in which Polycheria osborni
were most frequently found were: Aplidium californicum, Polyclinum
planum, Archidistoma diaphones, Archidistoma molle and Archidistoma
ritteri.
The average number of Polycheria osborni for these five
ascidians ranged from O to 21.9/cm for most samples. There wasn't
any trend of Polycheria osborni occurence between the West Point
area and Bird Rock area. In each ascidian species there is great
variance in the average number of Polycheria osborni/cm“. The
population densities of amphipods found in particularly heavily
infected regions of individual colonies ranged as high as 45/cm"
for Archidistoma diaphanes, and 67/cm" for Archidistoma ritteri. The
highest densities on Archidistoma ritteri occured on small colony
lobes where the area of the lobe was less than 1 cm"; therefore, the
actual number of Polycheria osborni counted was less than that
recorded/cm.
Extremely high populations, such as that of 45/cm" for Archi¬
distoma diaphanes, consisted very largely of juvenile Polycheria
osborni in burrows about 0.5 mm long. The density of Polycheria
osborni did vary with size. Fig. 2 shows diagrammatically the
difference in numbers of Polycheria osborni/cm" by size in colonies
of Archidistoma molle and Polyclinum planum. Although it is seen
