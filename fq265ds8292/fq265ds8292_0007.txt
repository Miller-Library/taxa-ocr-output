Featherstone
indicates that there may have been several newly hatched broods in
the sample. Aplidium californicum and Archidistoma molle may
have broods that were hatched several weeks early. Another possible
determining factor is the toughness of the ascidians. It was seen
that the young burrowed very quickly into Archidistoma diaphanes,
a soft ascidian, agreeing with the peak in Fig. 5 for that ascidian,
However, other soft ascidians, Archidistoma molle and Archidistoma
ritteri, do not support the idea of soft ascidians being good
hosts for the O.5 mm animals.
Amphipods are slightly longer than the burrows they occupy,
In order to be able to interpret burrow length in terms of amphipod
length, 15 burrows were measured, then the amphipods were removed
and measured. Results shown in Appendix A indicate a conversion
factor of 1.5:2 for burrow length to amphipod length.
Not only size classes but also the relation of size to sex
and sexual maturity was investigated. Of special interest was the
fact that in previous studies only female Polycheria osborni
had been found among the larger sized animals (Skogsberg and Vansell,
1928; Colman, 1898). In order to look further for male Polycheria
osborni, 107 amphipods of various sizes were removed from ascidians
of different species and from different colonies, and preserved
in 70% ethanol. The samples were haphazard with regard to ascidian
source, but while the larger animals were all taken, the smaller
juveniles were not collected in proportion to the numbers present
in the colonies. The animals were all measured with an occular
micrometer to the nearest 0.2 mm. On close examination, the populaÂ¬
tion could be separated into juveniles, males and females. The
