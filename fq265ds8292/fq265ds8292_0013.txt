The results of these observations show that the Polycheria popula¬
tion is quite dynamic. In Fig. 11, in all but 2 of the time inter¬
vals between successive observations, both large and small Poly-
cheria moved, changing burrows or disappearing completely. By
the end of 9 days all of the large amphipods had either changed
burrow or orientation within their burrow. All but 9 of the small
Polycheria had changed burrow location. During the time the colony
was kept in lab the Hopkins Marine Station seawater system ex-
perienced "bubble disease" and the Archidistoma diaphanes colony
got many air bubbles just below the surface tunic. Two small
Polycheria osborni were seen to be on top of these air bubbles
but were not in the same locations at the next observation, Con¬
siderable debris also settled on the ascidian during the 9 days
and no Polycheria osborni were observed in areas where the debris
was especially heavy.
To see if laboratory results reflected events actually occuring
in the field, 2 colonies of Archidistoma diaphanes were observed
on three successive days without disturbing them in any way. The
first colony observed consisted of several lobes in a 3.5 cm X 4 cm
area. In this sample the number of large (2 mm) and small ( 1 mm)
Polycheria osborni/lobe were counted, then counted again after 23
hours and compared. In the second sample a colony of Archidistoma
diaphanes (1.5 cm X 2 cm) was carefully diagrammed and the location
and orientations of the burrows recorded, then observed again
after 24 and 48 hours.
The results show that Polycheria do indeed move about.
Observations on the numbers of amphipods/lobe in the Archidistoma
diaphanes colony (Fig. 12) indicate that there was only one lobe
