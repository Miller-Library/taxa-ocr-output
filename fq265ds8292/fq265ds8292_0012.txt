are then bent quickly onto the burrow where the gnathopods scrape
the food off from the base to the tip of the antennae. Graphite
particles were observed in the antennae spread out and extended
perpendicular to the surface of the colony. After having been
scraped off by the gnathopods, the antennae again extended with
no graphite on them.
Another 'in burrow' behavior sometimes noted is that of
Polycheria turning around in its burrow. An amphipod does this
by rocking on its dorsal side up onto its head. It then rotates.
head down in the burrow while using its pereopods to pull it
around. Turning around takes about 3 seconds, and may be accomÂ¬
panied by several false starts in which the amphipod rocks but
not all the way to its head.
Movement of Polycheria from one burrow to another.
Published accounts of Polycheria leave the impression that the
amphipods, once burrowed in, remain permanently in place. Preliminary
observations showed that this is not the case, and that Polycheria
osborni does change burrows. To study amphipod movements, a colony
of Archidistoma diaphanes (4.8 X 2.8 cm) with 110 Polycheria osborni
burrowed into it (28 large and 82 newborn) was placed in a fingerbowl
with a very gentle flow of fresh sea water. At numerous times
during 9 days the colony was observed and the location of the
Polycheria osborni burrows plotted, the orientation of the larger
burrows noted and the general condition of the colony recorded,
The plottings of consecutive observations were compared to see
where old burrows and Polycheria osborni disappeared, where new
burrows appeared and where large burrow orientations changed,
