In addition, further observations of the animal in its burrow were
made to elucidate the direction of current flow, caused by the kicking
pleopods, the part this current plays in feeding, and a little
on how the animal feeds. The addition of a mixture of graphite
particles and diatoms added to the water in which the ascidian
sample was sitting allowed for easy observation of the current.
Behavior in the burrow of the 13 amphipods studied for 10
minutes each showed variation; each individual Polycheria is
represented by a separate vertical bar in Fig. 10. The Polycheria
osborni in the 3 different ascidians showed no significant differences
in behavior, therefore observations made in all 3 hosts have been
combined. The amount of time the 0.5 mm long Polycheria osborni were
closed, 0 minutes, is statistically significant in relation to the
other sizes of Polycheria osborni (RX C contingency test P.005).
Larger amphipods don't show behavior differences correlated with
size. Polycheria osborni may kick its pleopods for 15 seconds
without stopping or it may kick once, stop, and kick again. The
number of starts in Fig. 10 refers to this and not to the total time
spent kicking. Most of the Polycheria held their burrows open for
at least 2/3 of the time observed, and were kicking for less than
1/3 of the time open.
As Skogsberg and Vansell (1928) described, the current that
the pleopods make brings in water predominantly from the sides of
the burrow although water is also brought in from both ends. The
water then shoots almost straight up from the central part of
the body. This current brings fresh water by the gills, and also
by any eggs that may be in the brood pouchs of females. In addition,
some water does pass through the antennae bringing with it food
particles that get caught in the antennae. One or two antennae
