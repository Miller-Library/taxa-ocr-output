observed at short intervals for up to 280 minutes. For the first
30 minutes the transplanted Polycheria osborni was watched con-
tinuously so as not to miss the critical times for Polycheria
osborni that burrowed quickly. The time for burrowing was divided
up into the time that Polycheria osborni walked around on the
ascidian or swam off, the time from beginning the burrow to being
below the surface of the ascidian host, and the time until the
burrow could be closed when Polycheria osborni was disturbed.
Some amphipods when placed on any of the ascidians tested
for burrowing behavior quickly swam away; others were immediately
quiet, sitting on their backs on the ascidian whether they began
to burrow or not. It was observed that if, when Polycheria osborni
was placed on the ascidian, the antennae did not touch the host,
the amphipods often swam away. In contrast, whenever the antennae
contacted the ascidian the amphipods sat quietly on the ascidians
or would climb on the colony if not yet already on it.
The process of burrowing was described by Skogsberg and
Vansell (1928), but their studies involved only one species of
host ascidian. Present work shows that speed of burrowing may
vary, not only with the individual and with its size but also
with the host species (Fig. 9). Four Polycheria osborni placed
on Archidistoma psammion did not burrow, but sat or walked on the
ascidian, occassionally swimming off. Polycheria osborni burrowed
most quickly into Archidistoma molle, Archidistoma diaphanes,
and Aplidium californicum. Interestingly, all the experimental
amphipods burrowed into Clavelina huntsmani although they are
found in that host infrequently in the field. The actual mechanism
of burrowing was closely observed on Archidistoma molle supporting
the behavior described by Skogsberg and Vansell (1928).
