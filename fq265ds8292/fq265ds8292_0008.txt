males had two distinct copulatory appendages ventrally on the pos¬
terior edge of the eighth thoracic segment (Fig. 6). These appen¬
dages were clear to white and varied somewhat in size with the size
of the Polycheria osborni. Females could be identified by brood
plates (oostegites) in the thoracic region. Juveniles were those
Polycheria osborni which lacked both copulatory appendages and
oostegites. Fig. 7 shows the number of juveniles, males and females
at sizes from 0.5-3.6 mm. Juveniles were seen from the smallest
sizes through 2.2 mm. Males and females began to appear at 1.8 and
1.6 mmrespectively. Interestingly, in this haphazard sample there
were twice as many females as males. Several of the females
observed were gravid. The eggs in 12 broods were counted; egg
number ranged from 37 to 129 with a mean of 85.3 There was a
clear correlation between the size of females and the number of
eggs being carried (Fig. 8) but not between the age of the eggs
and the number of eggs. The eggs in a single brood were at different
stages of development but there were not distinct separations
in development as would appear if 2 batches were brooding.
Behavior of Polycheria osborni
Burrowing
Polycheria osborni removed from their burrows and placed on
or near ascidians, are capable of forming new burrows; the process
was observed in some detail by Skogsberg and Vansell (1928). In
the present work, experiments were performed to compare the burrowing
activities of Polycheria osborni of different sizes and of Polycheria
osborni on different ascidian substrates. In these experiments,
Polycheria osborni was removed from its burrow and placed on
the same colony or a new ascidian colony or species where it was
