here that the smaller amphipods occur in greater numbers/cm’.
the large Polycheria osborni burrows may be as close together as
the smaller. It has been observed that one large burrow may ac¬
tually run into another forming a 'T' or they may be end to end
with a very narrow band of tunic between the two animals,
Polyclinum planum was especially abundant at Mussel Point,
so counts were made of numerous whole colonies of different sizes
to see if a relationship exists between size of the ascidian
colony, which is possibly proportionate to age, and the number of
Polycheria osborni. The results, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that
there is no correlation between the size of the colony and the
number of amphipods/cm present. The Polyclinum planum varied in
firmness and diatom cover within each size class,
One feature of special interest from the standpoint of host/
commensal relations was the placement of Polycheria osborni
burrows in relation to the zooids of the ascidian colony, The
apertures of zooids, like the burrows of amphipods, generally
occur on the distal free surface of the colony or its lobes,
To determine the extent to which amphipods might be interfering
with the activities of the host zooids, numerous colonies of
6 species of ascidians were examined and the positions of amphipods
recorded. There were several possible locations for the burrows
(Fig. 4). Three of the ascidian species, Aplidium californicum,
Polyclinum planum, and Distaplia occidentalis have their zooids
arranged in systems, with a central common cloacal aperture for
the atrial outflow of several zoids, though each zooid has its
own separate oral aperture. In these colonies there are three
