possible burrow locations: in the center of the system, on or in
the common cloacal aperture; amongst or on the zooids of the system,
or in the tunic between the systems. The only Polycheria osborni
found within the common cloacal aperture was a newly hatched one,
less than 0.5 mm long which filled little of the aperture. The great
majority of the amphipods were situated in the clear areas of tunic
between adjacent systems, where interference with zooids was miniÂ¬
mal. The ascidians Archidistoma molle, Archidistoma diaphanes and
Archidistoma ritteri have both their atrial and oral apertures
opening independently to the exterior of the colony, and they are
not ordered in systems within the colony. The Polycheria osborni
burrows can be either on the zooids or between the zooids in these
ascidians, and most were found between zoids (Fig. 4). In either
position Polycheria osborni often appear to have pushed the zooid
aside to some extent at the top, as the zooid body descends into
the tunic at an abnormal slant under the body of the amphipod.
Seeing that Polycheria osborni occurs largely in areas betwen
zooids it could be assumed that in such a position it is not hurting
the zooids, whereas, if the Polycheria osborni is on top of the
zooid there might be some damage to them. In addition, if the
Polycheria osborni is competing for tunic with the zooids it
might not be a comfortable burrow. This was observed in Distaplia
occidentalis. In this ascidian the zooids and systems are close
together. As a Polycheria osborni burrowed in, pulling on the tunic,
the zooids were seen to contract, pulling the tunic out of the
grasp of the Polycheria osborni. The closeness of the zooids in
Distaplia occidentalis, a very soft ascidian, is possibly the
