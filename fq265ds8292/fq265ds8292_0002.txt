Distribution and location of Polycheria osborni
Ascidians were collected at low tide in 3 areas at Mussel
Point. The location termed West Point was exposed to considerable
wave action at all but the lowest tides. In the second and third
locations, the Bird Rock area and the Seal Island area, the force
of the waves was broken by offshore rocks. Ascidians were also
collected at Pescadero Point, on the open coast at the north tip
of Carmel Bay. Ascidian samples were taken from the rocks with
a putty knife. These were then brought into the lab where the
ascidian samples were measured, the Polycheria osborni burrow
positions were noted, counted and measured, and additional general
observations were made. The ascidians with Polycheria osborni
still in their burrows were maintained in a shallow trough provided
with a continuous flow of fresh seawater at 10 to 15 7C.
To find the distribution of Polycheria osborni in ascidians,
many samples of the ascidians common on Mussel Point were collected
haphazardly at various places and intertidal elevations, and studied
under a dissecting microscope in the laboratory. Burrows appear
as either zigzag seams or as oval openings on the free exposed
surface of the colony in which Polycheria osborni could be seen.
Surface area of each ascidian colony was calculated roughly from
the length and width of the surfaces bearing zooid apertures. The
number of Polycheria osborni burrows was counted, and the anterior-
posterior length of each occupied burrow was measured to the nearest
O.5 mm. The position of the Polycheria osborni in relation to the
zooids of the colony were also recorded.
