Introduction
Polycheria osborni is an amphipod found quite abundantly in
a variety of compound ascidian colonies in the lower intertidal
and subtidal areas from Puget Sound, Washington, to Southern
California. It was found in Aplidium (Amaroucium) by Colman (1898),
Skogsberg and Vansell (1928), and in Clavelina sp. by Alderman (1936).
Abbott and Newberry (1980) found Polycheria osborni in a variety
of other ascidians. Skogsberg and Vansell (1928) described its
structure and some of its behavior. In the present study the disÂ¬
tribution of Polycheria osborni in ascidians of the lower intertidal
area of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California was observed.
including the arrangement of the amphipods in the colony, the
sizes of the amphipods in the various ascidians, and a sex ratio
based on a subset of the population. Behavior of the Polycheria
was also observed; their behavior in the burrow and the movement
of them between burrows.
