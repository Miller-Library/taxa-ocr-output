reason the incidence is so low.
Size class structure and sexuality of the Polycheria
osborni population.
The body length of Polycheria osborni cannot be measured
accurately without removing the animals from their burrows, How¬
ever, burrow length is easily measured without disturbing the am¬
phipods, and provides a good index to the distribution of size
classes in the population.
A total of 1866 burrows were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm
in 5 species of colonial ascidians in the course of examining the
distribution of Polycheria osborni in ascidians. Results show at
the top of Fig. 5 that 64% of the population is in size classes
0-0.75 and 0.76-1.0 mm. The larger size class populations decrease
sharply to 1.5% in the largest size class, 3.0 mm.
When separate size class distinctions were calculated for
different ascidian species, some interesting differences appeared.
(Fig. 5). The Archidistoma diaphanes histogram is similar to that
of the whole population. Aplidium californicum and Archidistoma
molle show smaller percentages of the smallest animals, 0.5 mm,
and still fewer appear in Archidistoma ritteri while Polyclinum
planum shows a relatively even distribution of sizes. These differences
are statistically significant indicating some relationship between
amphipod size and the ascidian they burrow into (R X C contingency
test P .005).
Since there are often many small burrows around a large burrow
it is assumed that those are newly hatched. The peak in the popu¬
lation of 0.5 mm Polycheria osborni in Archidistoma diaphanes
