Featherstone
which had the original number of Polycheria at the end of the second
observations. In the colony where amphipod positions were mapped,
(Fig. 13) the number of Polycheria osborni/lobe did not change
much, but movement was still clearly evident.
Studies of Polycheria osborni movement indicate that when
amphipods leave burrows, these soon disappear, and few vacated burrows
are normally seen on infested colonies. To investigate how quickly
the ascidians were able to reshape the tunic after the burrow
was vacated, Polycheria osborni (1.5 mm) were carefully removed
from colonies of Polyclinum planum and Archidistoma diaphanes and
the burrows observed intermittently for 3 days.
Vacated burrows on Polyclinum planum took a mean of 20 hours to
disappear, one shallow burrow took only 5 hours to disappear,
while another deeper burrow took 30 hours. Burrows in Archidistoma
diaphanes took on the average 24 hours to disappear. On Polycheria
burrow extended all the way across a small lobe, and when it was
removed the ascidian did not fill that burrow but instead remained
as 2 smaller lobes.
