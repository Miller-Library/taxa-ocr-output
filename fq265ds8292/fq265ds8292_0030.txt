Fig. 1: Average and maximum distributions of Polycheria osborni/cm
on different species of ascidians at West Point (left)
and Bird Rock (right). rectangles: 1 mm-1 Polycheria
osborni.
Fig. 2: Number of Polycheria osborni/cm in relation to burrow
lengths: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. Burrows not to scale.
Fig. 3: Average and maximum numbers of Polycheria osborni/cm'
on Polyclinum planum colonies with surface areas from
1-66 cm". Each column shows mean, range, standard deviation
and 95% confidence limits of the mean,
Fig. 4: Position of Polycheria osborni in relation to the ascidian
zooids.
Fig. 5: Percent Polycheria osborni found in burrows to the nearest
0.5 mm burrow length in 5 ascidian hosts.
Fig. 6: Morphology of the ventral side of the 8th thoracic and
Ist abdominal segments of Polycheria osborni.
Fig. 7: Total numbers of juvenile, male and female Polycheria
osborni at body lengths from 0.6 to 3.6 mm measured to the
nearest 0.2 mm.
Fig. 8: Number of eggs in the female Polycheria osborni brood pouch
for amphipod lengths 2.4-3.8 mm.
Fig. 9: Length of time for Polycheria osborni to make a new burrow.
Non-burrowing time is the time spent walking on the ascidian
or swimming in the dish. Time for burrowing, solid line shows
the time until the Polycheria osborni is below the surface
of the ascidian, dashed line is the time until the burrow
can be closed.
