Summary
1. In the period April-June, 1980, ascidians were collected with
Polycheria osborni burrowed into them.
2. Polycheria osborni was abundant in Aplidium californicum, ArchiÂ¬
distoma diaphanes, A. molle, A. ritteri and Polyclinum planum;
scarce in Distaplia occidentalis and Clavelina huntsmani; and
absent in Archidistoma psammion, Synoicum parfustus, Aplidium
solidum and Perophora annectens.
3. Found predominantly between zooids of the ascidians, the Polycheria
don't appear to injure their hosts.
4. Two-thirds of the population of Polycheria observed were juveniles
less than 1.25 mm long.
5. Different species of ascidian had different size amphipods
predominating.
6. Male Polycheria osborni were reported for the first time and
can be identified by 2 copulatory appendages on the eighth thoracic
segment.
7. Polycheria sit in their burrows kicking their pleopods to make a
current, feeding and occasionally closing the burrow over them.
8. The population of Polycheria is dynamic, the amphipods change
burrow location and orientation.
9. Ascidian hosts usually reshape within 24 hours after a burrow
has been vacated.
