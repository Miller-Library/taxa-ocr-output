Adaptation to Anaerobiosis in Tigriopus californicus
INTRODUCTION
Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912), a harpacticoid copepod lives
mainly in the high tide pools along California's coast. The abundance
of high tide pools; the large density of indigenous animals; and their
ease of collection and maintenance all support the use of Tigriopus for
respiration studies.
Prosser (Prosser, 1961) divides animals into four categories based
on their utilization of oxygen: obligate anaerobes; infrequent aerobes;
aerobes which can withstand multi-hour periods of oxygen deprivation
(ie. frogs, aquatic snails); and, aerobic animals which depend on oxygen
but briefly accumulate an oxygen debt upon exposure to anoxia (ie. ceph¬
alopod molluscs). From studies done on the respiratory rate of harpacti¬
coid copepods (Pallares, 1974) there is little information that would
indicate how Tigriopus would fit in Prosser's classification.
The oxygen debt is recognized as an increase to an above normal con¬
sumption rate of oxygen following exposure of the animal to an anoxic
medjum. At exactly what level of oxygen saturation a medium becomes an¬
oxic varies for the animal in question. The biochemical pathways for an¬
aerobic respiration in invertebrates have been concisely reviewed by Ho¬
chachka (Hochachka, 1973, 1972). The debt appears to -come from the an¬
jmal's oxidation rate of substrates accumulated during anoxia being added
onto its normal consumption rate when the anoxic animal is re-introduced
into a non-anoxic medium. The variety of sustrates which build-up varies
with the animal (Stokes, 1968; Saz, 1971 ; Hochachka, 1975 ). Enzymatic
and fluorometric methods are known (Bergmeyer, 1965; Williamson, 1969)
allowing the changing concentrations of: glycerophosphate, succinate,
alanine, malate, lactate, etc., to be determined. These substrates form
