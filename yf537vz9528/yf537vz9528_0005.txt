Adaptation to Anaerobiosis in Tigriopus californicus
repayed at any point in the first ten minutes, the rate of consumption would
be from one-half to three times that which is observed.
It is important to note that Tigriopus become torporous prior to reach¬
ing anoxia. Using the rate comparisons in Table 2, one sees a decreasing
consumption rate post-anoxia for correspondingly longer periods spent anoxic.
Apparently the Tigriopus stategy adapts it to reducing oxygen concentration
by first reducing the animal's metabolic rate. Secondly, torpor occurs at
some low oxygen concentration with further metabolic suppression occurring
for longer periods of exposure to anoxia, as evinced by the lower post anoxic
rates.
Activity of Tigriopus during oxygen depletion changes drastically. Once
the percent of saturation falls below 4-9%, one finds Tigriopus immobile,
on the chamber's bottom. Observationally, this state appears to be one of
low oxygen induced torpor. Since Tigriopus depletes oxygen in the chamber
completely, torpor occurs prior to the total disappearance of oxygen. When
depletion is allowed to occur without turbulence the torporous state occurs
similarily, showing the state to be oxygen dependant. Return to saturated
water causes total revival to occur generally within 1-3 minutes at the
temperatures used.
The Qo's listed in Table 3 range from 1.4—1.9. This falls within
the acceptable range for marine invertebrates and does not warrant more of
a discussion.
