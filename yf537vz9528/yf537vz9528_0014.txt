Figures 4 through 12 represent different post-anoxic curves
graphed against their initial depletion curves. Open circles
trace out the post-anoxic curve, while crosses show for the
respective standard depletion curve. 0, utilization rates
for various time periods are arrived at by taking the slopes
of these curves through the times desired.
