Adaptation to Anaerobiosis in Tigriopus californicus
Where K, is the consumption rate at the temperature T,
RESULTS
The plot of percent saturation vs time as the Tigriopus respired was
a smooth curve. These were transformed into smooth curves of cc 0,/gram of
Tigriopus vs time for the three temperatures: 30, 25, 22 C (Figures 1, 2, and
3). Since three standard depletion runs exist for each temperature a mean
rate for various time periods can be calculated (Table 1). Rates as stated
earlier, came from slopes of linear of near linear sections of the consump¬
tion curves. The minimal consumption rate is also included in the table.
It represents the lowest determinable rate before the recorded rate reached
zero.
Each one of the standard depletion runs has its respective post-anoxic
run (Figures 4-12). The differing periods of anoxia per run are noted.
Table 2 tabulates the determined anoxic rates per time period in contrast
to the respective mean rate and the length of anoxia undergone. Graphically
these appear for 30 and 22 in Figures 13 and 14.
From the temperatures and rates listed in Table 2, a 0 was calculata¬
ble. The results are found in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Using the minimal rates calculated from the standard depletion curves,
one may ascertain the minimum debt which could be accumulated by Tigriopus
during the periods of anoxia. Since the post-anoxic rates generally are
less than the mean rates for the first three time periods, Tigriopus is not
repaying an oxygen debt. Calculations show that if the minimum debt were
