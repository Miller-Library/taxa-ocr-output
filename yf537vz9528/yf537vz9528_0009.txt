The following Standard Depletion Curves were made at
the constant temperatures noted. The weight of animals
used can be calculated from the Y-intercept in all these
cases if you know that 4.37, 4.78, and 5.03 cc 0,/liter
are the saturation concentrations of 0, at 30, 25 and 22
degrees centigrade respectively; and that, all experiments
were run in a one-half liter chamber. Salinity is a
constant at 36 parts per thousand. The different symbols
represent different weighted runs, identical in conditions.
