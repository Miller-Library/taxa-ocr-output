Adaptation to Anaerobiosis in Tigriopus californicus
SUMMARY
Tigriopus californicus activity varies from normal at 100% of oxygen
saturation to that of a torpid condition at 0%.
2. Gross physiological torpor occurs around 4-9% of oxygen saturation.
3. Post-anoxic oxygen consumption rates show no repayment of an oxygen
debt.
Increasing periods of anoxia show subsequently depressed rates of
4.
oxygen consumption.
5. Q0 values ranged from 1.4â€”1.9.
