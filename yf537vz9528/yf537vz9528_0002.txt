Adaptation to Anaerobiosis in Tigriopus californicus
so that the catabolic system achieves redox balance while partially operating
without oxygen. Thus the possession of an oxygen debt shows catabolism sup¬
plies energy needs during the anoxic period imposed.
Anoxic survival without accumulating an oxygen debt, by employing other
biochemical or physiological adaptations, is documented (Prosser, 1961).
Some animals accumulate the substrates and excrete them as waste. Activity
has been seen to diminish in ascarid worms as oxygen in the medium drops,
with hyperactivity noticeable upon return to aerobic conditions. Therefore
the lack of debt does not imply a dearth of energy for an organism during
anoxic conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tigriopus californicus collected from high tide pools ranging from
Cabrillo Point south to Carmel Beach acted as the experimental stock. All
animals were aquarium acclimated at ambient temperature (16-24 C) for at
least twelve hours and fed Tetranin" fish food on odd numbered days.
A Yellow Springs Instrument Model 53 Biological Oxygen Monitor attach¬
ed to a self-contained stirring probe registered the amount of oxygen
present in the chamber on a 0—100% of saturation scale. The read-out was
continuously recorded on a twelve inch Beckman Chart Recorder. Membrane
condition was followed daily using the Voltage Plateau Test and replaced
as necessary. For the test chamber a one-half liter Erlenmeyer flask pro¬
vided the appropriate aperture for the probe, while concurrently limiting
the sites where environmental oxygen diffusion could occur. Similar
methods have been used previously (Bayne, 1971; Sassaman, 1973 and 1972).
