Foraging in Conus Californicus
ABSTRACT
Conus californicus is the only temperate species of a large genus of predatory prosobranch
gastropods. We studied their foraging behavior and diurnal patterns of activity in relation to
fullness of the gut. We found 29% of 59 C. californicus obtained from the field had prey in
their gut. Of these, the most common prey items were the tube-dwelling polychaetes Sabella
crassicornis and Diopatra ornata. In the laboratory, C. californicus digested a full gut of S.
crassicornis in 44 to 60 hours. We also found that C. californicus are more active at night than
during daylight. In a laboratory experiment, C. californicus with full guts were significantly
less active than unfed individuals for two consecutive nights after feeding (P S.01). During the
third and fourth nights, activity increased and there were no significant differences between fed
and unfed individuals (P2.44). Throughout the experiment, there were never any differences
between fed and unfed individuals during daylight hours (p = 0.51). These results suggest that
activity of C. californicus is influenced strongly by prey consumption: immediately after
feeding, nocturnal activity decreases significantly. After an interval adequate for complete
digestion, nocturnal activity resumes rapidly.
