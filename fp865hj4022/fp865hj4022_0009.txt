Foraging in Conus Californicus
the sand. If the snail does rise from the sand it will begin to probe the prey item. The snail will
then fire its radula into the prey, and subsequently ingest the prey whole.
Once the experimental snails fed, they moved less on the following night (0.24 sq-h")
than unfed snails (0.905 sq-h"). Daytime movements were not significantly different between
any of the treated groups of snails throughout the 48-hour experiment.
The results of the 48-hour experiment led us to hypothesize that C. californicus are
active at night because they are foraging. To test this, we conducted the 96-hour experiment to
determine whether the fed snails would resume nocturnal activity after a period sufficient to
complete digestion.
On the first and second nights after feeding, the fed snails moved significantly less than
the pooled control and stimulated animals (P Â£ 0.01, Table 1). Stimulated and control groups
were not different on any of the four nights (P 0.21). By the third night, the fed snails
became more active, and they were no longer significantly different from the control or
stimulated snails (p = 0.44, Table 1, Fig. 4). The start of the third night corresponds to 53
hours after feeding. Our digestion time course study suggests that by this time, most fed snails
should have completed digestion. This increased level of activity continued on night 4
(P-0.84, Table 1) and confirmed the pattern that Conus are actively foraging when their guts
are empty. Day activity among stimulated, fed and control groups were never statistically
significantly different (p +0.43) (Table 1).
