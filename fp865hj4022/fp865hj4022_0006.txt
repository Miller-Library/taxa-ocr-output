Foraging in Conus Californicus
Therefore, we recorded snail position and activity on the grid at hourly intervals during dawn
(05:00-07:00) and dusk (19:00-21:00) and at 3 hour intervals during night and day. Snail
activity was observed for four days after the feeding.
Statistical Analysis
Movement data were analyzed using a 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with day
(4 levels), time (4 levels), and treatment (3 levels) as fixed factors.
All tests were conducted at the 0.05 level. Before analysis, homogeneity of variances
was determined using Cochranâ€™s test. Data were transformed using square roots, which
produced a non-significant Cochran's Test.
Two sets of planned comparisons were of interest. The procedural controls (stimulated
but not fed) were first compared to the controls (undisturbed). If this comparison was not
significant, the procedural control and control were pooled together and tested against the
experimentals (fed). These comparisons were conducted on the daytime and nighttime data
separately.
Sample sizes were unbalanced with 15 controls, 10 procedural controls, and I1
experimentals.
RESULTS
General Characteristics
Of the snails dissected for the gut content analysis, average shell length was 2.86 cm
and average width was 1.57 cm. The largest individual dissected was 3.7 cm and the smallest
was 1.6 cm long. Sex ratio of dissected individuals was 19 males to 26 females, and 10 were
unknown due to lack of gonad development.
