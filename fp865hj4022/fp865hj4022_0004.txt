Foraging in Conus Californicus
in it. Using a compound microscope we looked at scrapings from fore, mid and hind gut, and
identified larger prey fragments (Hartman 1969, Morris et. al 1980, Smith and Carlton 1975).
Core sediment samples were analyzed by counting numbers of each organism found
after sieving through a 3x3 mm screen.
Digestion Time
C. californicus individuals were left in a tank at ambient temperature with no sand for
48 hours. S. crassicornis were removed from their tubes and were fed to C. californicus. The
snails ate known masses of worms until they were satiated. Preliminary dissections showed
that after 30 hours negligible digestion had occurred. In light of this, snails were dissected
starting at 32 hours until 52 hours, at four hour intervals. Undigested portions of the worm
remaining in the gut were removed and wet weight was taken. The undigested portions were
dried and weighed. A regression line of amount digested over time was used to estimate total
digestion time.
Activity Patterns and Foraging Behavior
We examined the relationship between activity patterns and feeding behavior in three
laboratory experiments in two outdoor tanks: an intensive 24-hour study of activity patterns,
and two comparisons of fed and unfed snails (over 48-hours and 96-hours). The tanks were
2.24 mx 0.96 m with water depths between 0.34 m and 0.38 m. A layer 3-5 cm thick of fine-
grained beach sand was placed at the bottom of each tank. Seawater circulated through the
tanks providing ambient temperature (10-12Â°C). String grid lines attached over the tank created
a 11x5 matrix of squares 20 cm x 20 cm.
