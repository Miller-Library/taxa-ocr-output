Foraging in Conus Californicus
General Observations
Symbionts of C. californicus
The peacrab Opisthopus transversus is a commensal of C. californicus (Wolfson 1974).
Surprisingly, we also found a peacrab that had been eaten by Conus in the field. Because the
crab was still alive, we fed it to another Conus which readily ate it. Three of the 58 Conus that
were dissected had a commensal O. transversus in their mantle cavities. The size of these
commensal crabs was -2mm and size of the crab that had been eaten was -Icm.
Field observations
The apparent abundance of C. californicus varied from day to day. We saw the snails
both individually and in groups of 3 or more. On different days, C. californicus could be very
abundant, less abundant, and scarce in the same D. ornata beds. When they were abundant,
there were groups of at least four Conus touching each other, and other individuals were nearby
within a small area of 1-2mâ€™.
We observed the seastar Pisaster brevispinus eating C. californicus. We also observed
a single C. californicus sitting on the aperture of a D. ornata tube with its proboscis extended.
This is the only case that a Conus was observed in the field with its proboscis extended.
Diet and Digestion Rate
The most commonly consumed organisms were the tube-dwelling polychaetes S.
crassicornis and D. ornata (Fig 1). These are also the two most abundant organisms in the
habitat. Other organisms found in the gut were an unidentified terebellid, Opisthopus
transversus (pea crab), and unidentifiable polychaete parts. Of the 59 cone snails sampled, 17
were found with a full gut. Partially digested D. ornata were covered with a white milky
