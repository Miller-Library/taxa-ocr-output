Foraging in Conus Californicus
coating. Some less digested sabellids were still undergoing muscle contractions upon being
removed from the esophagus of C. californicus.
In the laboratory, Conus ate Olivella biplicata only after several weeks of starvation. It
showed no interest in Nassarius mendicus. We also made laboratory observations of Conus
eating the following polychaetes: Pherusa capulata (from the anterior end), Pareurythoe
californica, Eunice valens, Glycera sp. The snails ate these prey items in a manner similar to
previous observations. D. ornata and Glycera sp. used their jaws and extensible proboscis,
respectively, to defend themselves from the Conus snails.
Foraging Behavior and Digestion Rates
The regression line of percent digested over time (Fig 2) suggests that 60 hours is the
maximum time for snails to digest a full gut of S. crassicornis. Despite low correlation (r -
0.228), we can be assured that after 60 hours a known amount of sabellid will be fully digested
by the snail.
Initial 24-hour study in the laboratory showed that C. californicus are above the surface
of the sediment and moving at night, but are sedentary and often completely buried during the
day. During the 24 hour pre-feeding period of the 48-hour experiment there were no significant
differences among experimental, control and procedural control groups before they were fed or
stimulated (Fig. 3). Average night activity was high (0.87 sq-h"). Snails were inactive during
the day (0.16 sq-h). During daylight hours we have observed that the cone snail will usually
bury itself under the sand. If a prey item is in close proximity the cone snail will be aroused
and will rise from the sand. In other cases, the snail will also extend its proboscis from beneath
