Foraging in Conus Californicus
Introduction
The predatory cone snail is a marine neogastropod that occurs widely in tropical waters.
Conus is considered to be a successful genus (Olivera 1997) with over 500 species. Conus
californicus is the only species found in temperate waters. Cone snails produce potent venoms
for purposes such as prey capture and defense (Olivera 1997). Few papers describe behavior
and feeding habits of C. californicus, (Saunders and Wolfson 1961) but these studies were in
small laboratory aquaria at 21Â°C which do not represent the colder environment of the snails
found in central California at Hopkins Marine Life Refuge.
The range of C. californicus extends from the north in the Farallon Islands (San
Francisco) to as far south as Bahia Magdalena (Baja California) (Morris et al. 1980). The cone
snails used for this study were found in D. ornata beds at Hopkins Marine Life Refuge in the
subtidal at -10m depth. D. ornata is a tube-dwelling polychaete that secretes a parchment-like
tube, often decorated with red algae and shell debris. D. ornata beds create a refuge habitat
(Woodin 1978) for a wide variety of animals such as other polychaete worms, gastropods, and
echinoderms.
The feeding mechanism of C. californicus is similar to its tropical relatives. Cone snails
possess a highly modified radula whose teeth are poison harpoons used to subdue prey. This
radula is connected to a venom apparatus that consists of a venom duct which produces the
venom, and a venom bulb (Bingham et al. 1996). The bulb ejects the radula tooth and venom
through the tip of the proboscis into the prey item (Saunders and Wolfson 1961). The exact
firing mechanism is not known.
