Foraging in Conus Californicus
may be foraging for tube worms beneath the sand. Snails may maintain their preferred daytime
buried position, but feed at every opportunity.
Fragmented portions of D. ornata found in the gut were identifiable by distinctive
parapodia and setae. One of the fragments had a developing anterior end with tentacles.
Development was similar to a collected D. ornata tube containing a fully developed worm and
a second regenerating worm. An area of further investigation is whether Conus has a food
preference for immature or regenerating D. ornata. This may also reveal how Conus capture
D. ornata.
The digestion rate study gave a regression line with low r and high variability.
Possible reasons for this poor fit is our use of highly variable wet weights to estimate percent
digestion. We consistently found that after 44 hours a high percent of the meal had been
digested. One outlier shows that an animal may not have been coping with laboratory
conditions.
Activity Patterns
Because the activity of the snails drops significantly when they have eaten a full meal
and rises once digestion has occurred, it is clear that their night activity is associated with
foraging. During dawn there is variable but high level of activity, which may be associated
with the night to day transition of snail activity.
Further field investigations would include how abundance of cone snails varies with
different densities of D. ornata. Dense D. ornata may be preferred habitat. Another extension
of the foraging behavior study could examine how foraging behavior is affected by mating
aggregations that occur during the spring and summer.
