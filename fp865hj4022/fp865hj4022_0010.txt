Foraging in Conus Californicus
DISCUSSION
Diet and Digestion
The finding that C. californicus eats mostly D. ornata and S. crassicornis contrasts with
studies on C. californicus in southern California. Our study shows a more narrow range of prey
choice. Other studies have shown C. californicus to eat not only polychaetes and crustaceans
but also gastropods, bivalves, cephalopods and fish (Kohn 1966). These previous studies were
carried out at southern California ambient temperatures which are up to 10Â°C warmer than in
Monterey Bay. This could lead to more active snails, which may explain more active hunting.
We did not encounter most of the prey species studied by Saunders and Wolfson (1961).
However in the case of O. biplicata, Saunders and Wolfson (1961) and Kohn (1966) report that
C. californicus readily eat the gastropod, whereas central California C. californicus may eat O.
biplicata, but not as readily.
Since 29% of the snails collected had full guts, this indicates that at a given time, 29%
of snails have recently eaten. Snails collected for this study were mainly on top of the sand and
were collected during the day. An area of further study would be to examine snails collected at
night. They may show different levels of full guts as well as different prey items. Also there
might be different densities of the animals above the surface.
It is still unclear how C. californicus extracts the worms from their tubes. In the field,
an individual C. californicus was sometimes found half buried with its posterior pointing
vertically from the sand. In the laboratory, after placing S. crassicornis worms near a buried
snail, it would capture and consume the worm with its proboscis without emerging from the
sand. We also observed C. californicus moving under the sand without rising. These snails
