Foraging in Conus Californicus
FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1. Frequency of each prey item in the gut of C. californicus and frequency of organisms in
surrounding sediments. Organisms included in the graph had frequency n2 3. Other
groups of organisms found but not shown in the graph included polychaetes in the
families Polynoidae, Nephytydae, Phyllodocidae, Arabellidae, Flabelligeridae, also the
Echinoderms: sea urchins, sand dollars, the Molluscs: Rictaxis punctocaelatus, eolid
nudibranch, and Crustacean: caprellid.
Fig. 2. C. californicus fed a known amount of S. crassicornis. Dissections at four hour
intervals and wet weights of gut contents reveal the percent digested.
Fig. 3. Unfed C. californicus allocated as experimental, control and procedural control groups.
Monitored at hourly intervals. Dusk is from 19:00 - 21:00, and dawn is from 05:00-
07:00. Error bars are the standard errors of the means.
Fig. 4. Activity of fed C. californicus during 96-hours after feeding. Monitored at three hour
intervals during the day (07:00 - 18:00) and during night (21:00 - 05:00). Error bars are the
standard errors of the means. Movement rates at dawn and dusk are not shown.
