Foraging in Conus Californicus
C. californicus waves its siphon slowly from side to side as it moves, and it can sense
prey by smell using the osphradium. C. californicus begins to extend its proboscis when it
senses prey in the vicinity. The proboscis can extend the length of the snail. After
encountering prey, the snail gently touches the edge with the proboscis until the cone decides to
harpoon the prey with a radula tooth. A small release of venom can be seen as the live prey is
drawn into the buccal cavity.
Many studies have examined the toxicology and ecology of tropical species (Olivera
1999, Kohn 1959). C. californicus is the only temperate species of Conus despite the large
diversity in the tropics. Our study provides a source of information for a species whose diet
and behavior in Monterey is not well-documented. The main focus of this study was to
examine foraging behavior, digestion rates, and prey items that occur in the snail's natural
environment. We have studied the gut contents of specimens collected from the field and
examined cone snail foraging behavior under laboratory conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Diet and Sediment Study
We collected 59 cone snails for gut analysis in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge over a 6
week period. We took a core sample of the sediment below each collected snail. Approximate
dimensions of the sample are 1Ocm deep with a 157cm' surface area.
Snails were dissected within 5 hours of collection. Individuals were relaxed in MgCl,
for 15 -30 minutes. The snail shell was gently cracked using pliers and separated from the soft
parts. Dissection of the soft parts involved an incision at the mouth. We separated the
proboscis and the gut from the remainder of the body in order to examine any prey parts present
