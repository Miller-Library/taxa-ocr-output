Foraging in Conus Californicus
CONCLUSION
Study of foraging behavior and diurnal patterns of C. californicus revealed that of snails
captured during the day 29% were feeding at any given time. The most common prey items
both in the sediment near by the C. californicus found, and in the dissected gut are the tube-
dwelling polychaetes S. crassicornis, and D. ornata. Digestion of a full gut of S. crassicornis
takes between 44 and 60 hours. C. californicus forage during the night when they have high
levels of activity. Day activity is consistently low for C. californicus that have fed, and those
that have not (p=.51). After ingesting a full gut of S. crassicornis, C. californicus become less
active until they have finished digesting (pS.01), at which time nocturnal activity returns to
levels of snails that have not eaten (pÂ».44).
