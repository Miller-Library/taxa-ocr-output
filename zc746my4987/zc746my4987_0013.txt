DISCUSSION
Cushing (1951) in a review on diurnal migration
among zooplankton, saw temperature as defining the limits
of vertical movement. The present study would seem to
substantiate this conclusion in so far as the early
stages of B. glandula and P. polymerus nauplii are con-
cerned. B. glandula and P..polymerus nauplii tended to be
negatively phototactic at higher temperatures and
positively phototactic at lower temperatures. Ewald (1912)
reported similar results. for various stages of B. perforatus.
With Balanus the shift from negative to positive photo-
taxis (using a horizontal beam of 11 foot-candles)
occurred between 11° and 9°0. With Pollicipes under the
same conditions, the shift occurred between 9° and 7°0
but, with a less intense beam (1 foot-candle) the
shift occurred at 11°0. In the course of this study
the effect of temperature alone never seemed to be ab-
solute. In complete darkness nauplii swarmed via negative
geotaxis in 3 cm. zones delimited by temperatures of both
16° to 12°0, and 18° to 9°0. In both cases these zones
represented a warm water thermocline. Yet a warm water
thermocline seemed only to dely the positive phototaxis
ellicited by an overhead beam of 6 foot-candles. Indeed.
nauplii appeared capable of acclimating to both the
increased temperatures and high light intensity produced
