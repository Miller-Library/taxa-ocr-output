tactic at low light intensities and negatively photo-
tactic at high light intensities. No explanation was
offered as to why the nauplii stayed at the surface once
the sun had set. In a supplement to their original work
on B. perforatus, Groom and Loeb (1890) reported a simi-
lar response to high and low light intensities for nauplii
of the barnacles Chthamalus stellatus (Poli), Lepas
nus balanoides (Poli). Short
pectinata (Spengler), and Bala
wavelengths of light were found to be the most effective
in elliciting a photo-response.
The influence of temperature upon the sign of photo-
taxis of Balanus nauplii (species not designated) has
also been investigated (Ewald, 1912). Ewald reported that
an increase of temperature caused reversal of positive
phototaxis while conversely, a decrease of temperature
caused negatively phototactic animals to become positively
phototactic.
The present study represents an investigation of the
effect of temperature, gravity, and light as well as their
mutual interactions on the orientation and movements of
the barnacles Balanus
glandula and Pollicipes polymerus.
The results indicate a definite correlation between temper-
ature and the sign of phototaxis. Furthermore it was
