tube and 50% dead at the bottom (fig. 6, B).
ipparently, prolonged exposure to the warm upper waters
of the tube were detrimontal to the nauplii. Perhaps
as they sank from the warm zone which had killed many of
them, some nauplii were revived by the cooler waters
causing them to accumulate at the thermocline. It
could not be determined from these results whether or
not nauplii in complete darkness could discriminate
between temperature and gravity.

Nauplii were dark adapted for 2 hours and then dis-
persed equally throughout a 70 cm. vertical tube. An
overhead beam of 1 foot-candle at the water surface
caused all the nauplii to swarm to the water surface
witnin 1/2 hour. Complete darkness was restored for 1
hour and 20 minutes at which time an overhead beam of
3000 foot-candles was turned on. At time zero, the water
mperature throughout the tube was 12Â°0. A heat filter
was not used, therefore a temperature gradient was soon
created in the tube. The migration of the nauplii
during the 120 minute period of the experiment is
graphed in fig. 7. Water temperatures at various depths
ter 15 minutes and 120 minutes are also shown on the
graph. The temperature gradient created in the tube after
15 minutes does not seem to account for the observed dis-
