at night. The limits of this migration would most probably
be determined by temperature. It is predicted that a field
study would find Pollicipes and Balanus nauplii at the
rface during the night, descending during the day,
and rising to the surface again at night.
SUMMARY
2nd stage Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby) and 2nd
and 3rd stage Balanus glandula (Darwin) nauplii tend to
be negatively phototactic at higher temperatures and
positively phototactic at lower temperatures.
2. The effect of temperature on naupliar behavior is
never absolute. Nauplii appeared capable of adaption to
both increased temperature and increased light intensity.
3. 2nd stage P. polvmerus nauplii were found to be
negatively geotactic in complete darkness. This upward
gration could be stopped by warm water thermoclines of
both 9° to 18°0 and 12° to 16°0.
1. Negative phototaxis ellicited by a beam of 3000
foot-candles could be stopped by cold waters of 7.0 to 7.2°0.
5. An apparent interaction of negative phototaxis and
positive geotaxis seems to account for the downward
migration of Pollicipes nauplii.
6. The possibility that early stages of Pollicipes
and Balanus nauplii exhibit diurnal migration in the field
is disoussed.
