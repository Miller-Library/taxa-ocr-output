degree) in the horizontal chamber using a horizontal
beam with an intensity of 11 foot-candles. 115 individuals
were tested at each temperature and nauplii used at one
temperature were not used again. Results indicating the
percentage of animals swimming to the positive, negative.
or neutral section of the testing chamber are graphed
in fig. 1. The shift from negative to positive photo-
taxis among a majority of the animals occurred between
11° and 9°0.
An identical series of experiments were conducted
with 2nd stage Pollicines nauplii. 360 individuals were
tested at a given temperature as described above. The
results are graphed in fig. 2, A. In this case reversal
of the negatively phototactic response occurred between
9° and 7°c.
The difference in the temperature at which reversal
took place in the two species might be accounted for
by dissimilar sensitivities to a given light intensity.
To test this nypothesis, the same experiment was repeated
ith Pollicibes. In this case, however, the intensity
the horizontal beam was reduced to l foot-candle. The
results are graphed in fig. 2, B and as suspected the
temperature at which reversal occurred was shifted upwards
to about 11°0.
