below with a beam of 300 foot-candles. A heat filter

of the tube when the light was turned on. They rapidly
desconded to the bottom of the tube where they remained
(fig. 1). Some nauplii actively swam downward, but most
simply sank the 70 cm.
The question arose as to how nauplii would behave
in complete darkness. Accordingly nauplii were dispersed
evenly throughout a 70 cm. vertical tube and kept in com-
plete darkness at 12°0. After nine hours 99% of the
nauplii were found to be swarming in the upper 3 cm, of
the tube. Similar results were obtained at a temperature
of 19.5°0. This suggested that an apparent negative
geotaxis was effected in complete darkness.
To determine whether or not temperature could modify
this apparent geotaxis, nauplii were dispersed in the
bottom portion of a vertical tube. This portion was
surrounded by a water bath of 12.0°0. The water surface
at the top of the tube was allowed to warm up to 22°0.
Thus, a sharp warm water thermocline was produced in the
tube just above the surface of the water bath. (It should
be noted that a rapid increase in temperature over a short
