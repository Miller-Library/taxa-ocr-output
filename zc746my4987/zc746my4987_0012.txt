To determine the effect a cold water thermocline
nas upon negative phototaxis, nauplii were allowed to
adapt to complete darkness for 10 hours at 12째0 in the
upper 10 cm. of a vertical tube. A 3000 foot-candle beam
of light was then turned on. A cold water bath of 5째0
produced a sharp cold water thermocline at the 30 cm.
pth. After 10 minutes, the water bath was pulled down
10 cm. shifting the thermocline with it. Results over a
30 minute period are graphed in fig. 9 (compare with fig,
7). A water temperature of 7.0째 to 7.2째0 was sufficient
to stop migration resulting from negative phototaxis.

ig the progress of these experiments, the
Du
swimming orientation of Pollicipes nauplii was observed.
No matter how the beam of light was oriented, that is
from above, the side, or below, the general orientation
of the nauplii was the same. They were almost always
oriented with their ventral sides up, although all manners
of circus movement were also observed. This posture seemed
to be determined mechanically since dead nauplii sank
with their ventral sides up and their heads slightly
down. Batham (1916) reported similar observations on the
newly hatched nauplii of Pollicipes spinosus (Quoy and
Gaimard) which also swam with their ventral surfaces
ppermost.
