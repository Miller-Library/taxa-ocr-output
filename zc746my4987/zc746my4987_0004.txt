water depth was maintained at.7 cm. for each testing.
Two glass partitions could be dropped into the chamber
dividing it into three equal sections. The section
closest to the light source (an AO No. 1087 microscope
lamp) being termed "positive", the middle section "neutral",
and the section away from the light "negative". The
temperature of the testing chamber was kept constant by
means of a circulating water bath. All temperature
readings were taken with a Yellow Springs Tele-Thermometer
equipped with a No. 102 small animal probe. The test beam
of light passed horizontally through the water bath
before entering the positive end of the testing chamber.
Whus, infra-red rays were largely eliminated. The
intensity of the light beam was measured 1 inch from the
end of the positive chamber at the point where the light
entered the water bath. Light intensities were determined
with a General Electric, Type DW-68 Exposure Meter and the
intensity regulated with AO optical density filters.
Reflecting surfaces were blackened wherever possible.
Before each test the nauplii were placed in 100 ml.
beakers and acclimated to dim, diffuse light for at
least one hour. The light intensity at the water surface
of the beakers was maintained at less than 1/2 foot-
candle. Approximately 50 to 100 nauplii were injected
into the testing chamber and exposed to a given water
