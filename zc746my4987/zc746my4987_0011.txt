tribution of nauplii. The initial response seemed
mainly due to the light. However, after 2 hours of
constant exposure to the beam, 90% of the nauplii had
igrated back again into the upper 10 cm. of the tube.
Yet the original 12째0 water temperature had given way
here to a gradient of 21째 at the surface to 12.9째0 at the
10 cm. level. Apparently, the nauplii were able to
acclimate to both the increase in temperature and the
3000 foot-candle beam of light. It cannot be determined
rom these observations whether it is the light or
temperature stimulus or both which causes the nauplii to
ascend to the upper 10 cm. of the tube.
Investigations were subsequently conducted to
determine the effect a thermocline might have upon photo-
taxis. Nauplii were accumulated at a warm water thermo-
cline in complete darkness as described above. A beam
of o foot-candles was turned on above the vertical tube.
The results over a 120 minute period are graphed in fig.
8, A. A similar experiment was conducted, but in this
case when the overhead light was turned on, the water
temperature was caused to equilibrate at a temperature of
2째0 throughout the entire tube. Results over a 120 minute
period are graphed in fig. 8, B. The warm water thermo-
cline seemed to delay the positively phototactic ascent
of the nauplii.
