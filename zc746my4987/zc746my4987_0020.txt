FIG. 6
Behavior of nauplii injected into water of between 19.1
and 19.5Â°0 au the top of a warm water thermocline and
kept in complete darkness for 10 hours.

Fig. 7
Response of dark adapted nauplii to 3000 foot-candles
of light and increasing temperatures. The water
temperatures after 15 and 120 minutes are indicated on
the graph and the light source was from above.
A) The effect of a warm water thermocline upon positive
phototaxis ellicited by a beam of 6 foot-candles. The
light source was from above.
B) Response of nauplii when the water temperature is
caused to equilibrate at a temperature of 1200
throughout the entire tube. The beam of 6 foot-
candles was from above.
G.
The effect of a cold water thermocline upon negative
phototaxis. After 10 minutes, the cold water bath
was pulled down 10 cm. The beam of 3000 foot-candles
was from above.
