While performing experiments in the horizontal
chamber, it was noticed that the nauplii usually swam
near the bottom of the container. This suggested that
ravitational vector was coupled with their phototactic
a
responses.
To investigate this possibility, nauplii were placed
in the upper 10 cm. of a vertical tube (all subsequent
investigations were carried out in vertical tubes with
2nd stage Pollicipes nauplii) where they remained in
complete darkness for two hours at a constant temperatu
of 12Â°0. The tube was suddenly illuminated from the side
with 9 foot-candles of light from a vertical fluorescent
lamp. The nauplii responded by swimming toward the light
and aggregating on the illiminated side of the tube. At
the same time however, they swam downward, distributing
themselves evenly to about a 16 cm. depth, where they
seemed to stop their descent abruptly. When the lamp
was moved downward, there was a corresponding downward
shift of the nauplii leaving a few scattered individuals
a the upper 20 cm. of the tube (fig. 3). For some
reason not readily apparent, when the lamp was moved up
again to its original position, the nauplii did not
follow.
