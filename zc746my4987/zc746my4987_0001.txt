INTRODUCTION
The literature on vertical migration of marine
and freshwater zooplankton is voluminous. Compre-
hensive reviews on the topic have been compiled by R.
S. Russel (1927), D.H. Cushing (1951), R. Bainbnidge
(1961), and K. Banse (1964). Light intensity is gener-
ally held to be the main effector of diurnal movement,
but numerous other factors may be influential as modi-
ying agents including among others, the stage of devel-
opment, intrinsic physiological rhythms, and temperature.
With marine organisms, research has been concentrated on
the Copepoda and Cladocera, although the Mysidacea, Isop-
oda, Amphipoda, Euphausiacea, and the Decapoda have been
investigated to some extent (Bainbridge, 1961). Rela-
tively little seems to be known about the nauplii of the
Cirripedia, however.
Von willem√∂es-Suhm (1875) recorded that in the
Pacific the nauplii of Lepas fasicularis (Ellis and Soland-
er) maintained a depth of 60 fathoms (approximately 110 m.)
during the day and rose to the surface during the night.
He made no speculation concerning the stimuli involved in
this migration. Groom and Loeb (1890) reported that the
nauplii of Balanus perforatus (Bruguiere) at Naples reached
a depth of 30 to 10 m. during the day and rose to the sur-
