Specimens of B. glandula were collected intertidally
at the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California,
while P. polvmerus were obtained from Yankee Point,
California, approximately 11 miles south of Pacific Grove.
In all cases, ripe ovigerous lamellae were dissected out
of the barnacles while still in the field. The lamellae
were stored in seawater during transportation to the
laboratory and during this time no attempt was made to
control temperature. In the laboratory, water temperature
was constantly maintained at 12Â° C. Lamellae were broken
apart mechanically to facilitate hatching and the nauplii
which hatched were fed on Platymonas sp. Random sampling
indicated that most of the Pollicipes nauplii tested were
in the 2nd stage of development, while those of Balanus
were found to be in both the 2nd and 3rdstages (staging
according to Snodgrass, 1967, Pers. Comm.).
A horizontal testing chamber was used to test the
fect of temperature on the sign of phototaxis. It
measured 1.5 cm. in length by 1.3 cm. in width, while the
