distance will be termed a "warm water thermocline" through-
out this paper. Similarly, a rapid decrease in temperature
over a short distance will be termed a "cold water thermo-
cline"). After 10 hours of complete darkness, the
nauplii were found swarming in a 3 cm. zone in the middle
of the tube (fig. 5). The temperatures delimiting the
zone were 16° and 12°0. A further experiment was run
with the water bath at 8°0. This time the water surface
in the tube was at 20°C. After 11 hours the nauplii
rain were swarming in a 3 cm. zone in the middle of the
tube. This time the zone was delimited by temperatures of

the presence of a thermocline could indeed inhibit
movement initiated by apparent negative geotaxis. This
inhibition seemed not to be caused by temperature alone,
but rather by a rapid change in temperature.
To see if nauplii in complete darkness could dis-
criminate between gravity and temperature, animals were
injected into the top of a tube which was 19.590 at the
water surface. A water bath of 12°0 surrounded the
bottom half of the tube. After 10 hours, 25% of the
nauplii were swarming in the top of the tube, 25% were dead
at the bottom of the tube, and 50% were swarming in the
middle of the tube (fig. 6, A). A similar experiment
found 50% of the nauplii swarming in the middle of the
