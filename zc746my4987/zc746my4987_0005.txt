mperature for a period of five minutes. A horizontal
beam of known intensity was then turned on. The nauplii
were allowed to react to the beam from two to five
minutes until a definite phototactic response had been
demonstrated. The two glass partions were then inserted
into the testing chamber and the number of nauplii in
each section counted.
No field studies are available to document the
possible existence of diurnal migration of 2nd stage
Pollicipes nauplii. However, experiments in vertical
tubes were carried out to observe the interaction and
influence of temperature, gravity, and light on naupliar
behavior. The tubes were 70 cm. long and had an inside
diameter of 1 cm. A glass slide was glued to the bottom
of some tubes, while blackened corks were inserted in
others. The same light source and filiers were used as
before with the addition of a Corning No. 3966 heat
filter. For these experiments, 500 to 1000 nauplii were
injected into each tube after the water had been thoroughly
oxygenated.
