CAPTIONS
â€”
Fic. 1
The effect of tomperature on the sign of phototaxis
of B. glandula 2nd and 3rd stage nauplii. 115 indivi-
duals were tested at a each temperature.
IG. 2
The effect of temperatune on the sign of phototaxis of
2nd stage Pollicipes nauplii. 360 individuals were
tested at each temperature.
IG. 3
Interaction of gravity and phototaxis. The tube was
illuminated from the side with 9 foot-candles of light
from a vertical fluorescent lamp. (All polygon graphs
were sketched from observation).
FIG. L
Interaction of gravity and phototaxis. Dark adapted
nauplii were illuminated from below with 300 foot-
candles of light.
FIG. 5
The effect of a warm water thermocline on negative
geotaxis in complete darkness.
