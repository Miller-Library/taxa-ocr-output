It has been proposed that colder water temperatures are the primary selective force
limiting S. californiumâ€™s range to the south (LaJeunesse and Trench, 2000). Although local water
temperature has been well established as the most important factor in determining Anthopleura
symbiont type at the phylum level (Saunders and Muller-Parker, 1997; Secord and Augustine,
2000), its effects on symbiont population at the species level have not been directly studied.
Most studies of temperature effects on symbiont population composition in cnidarians focus on
tropical subtidal species, and most directly demonstrated physiological species boundaries are for
maximum rather than minimum thermal tolerances (Baker, 2003). Since A. elegantissima is an
intertidal species exposed to a much wider range of environmental extremes, those studies may
have limited applicability.
The biogeographic complexity of the transition zone raises questions about the
hypothesis that cold water temperatures are the major factor controlling the distribution of
Symbiodinium type in A. elegantissima. How can temperature variation account for the
ubiquitous representation of S. californium in samples from Salt Point and Shelter Cove and its
complete absence from samples at two points in between? The relative lack of sites showing
multiple symbiont community profiles suggests that either competition between symbiont types
is strong enough to act uniformly on small differences, or that the local environmental
differences controlling symbiont community structure are large enough to generate a sharp cline.
If water temperature is the controlling variable, measurements at those locations should track the
symbiont distribution. Such an observation would be the first strong evidence in favor of that
hypothesis.
Because A. elegantissima is a mid- to upper-intertidal organism, however, its most
significant thermal stresses are likely to occur when exposed to air. Studies of another Pacific
