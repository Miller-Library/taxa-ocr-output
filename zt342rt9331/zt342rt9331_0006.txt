final extension. Some successful screens were reamplified using the internal SSU primers and
reaction conditions as described above.
Screens were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained in ethydium bromide, and those
yielding the desired band size were cleaned for sequencing using shrimp alkaline phosphatase
and exonuclease.
Cycle sequencing was performed on a DYADTM thermocycler (MJ Research) in 1Oul
reactions containing 6.5ul water, 1.75ul 5X sequencing buffer, lul cleaned PCR template,
0.25ul primer, and 0.5ul BigDye6 from Applied Biosystems, Inc. Reaction conditions were as
follows: initial denaturing at 96째 C for 3 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 96째 C for 10 seconds,
50째 C for 10 seconds, and 60째 C for 4 minutes. Sequencing was attempted using all primers
described above. DNA was precipitated from the product with 40ul of 75% isopropanol and
pelleted in a centrifuge at 12,500g for 1 hour. Pellets were dried, resuspended in formamide, and
sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyzer.
Sequences were cleaned and aligned in SequencherTM 4.2 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).
Alignments were exported to PAUP* 4.0b10 (available from Sinauer Associates, Inc) and
analyzed for parsimony.
Results
Digestion with aTagl yielded three characteristic RFLP profiles distributed
geographically (Fig 1). The first, found north of Cape Mendecino, has distinct bands at
approximately 900bp, 500bp, and 200bp (Fig 2a), equivalent to the restriction sites for S.
muscatinei as described by LaJeunesse and Trench (2000).
