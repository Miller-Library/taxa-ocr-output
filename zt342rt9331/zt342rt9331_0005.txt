minutes; 35 cycles of 92°C denaturing for 30 seconds, 50°C annealing for 1 minute, and 72
extension for 1 minute; and a final 5 minute extension at 72°C. Amplifications were visualized
on 1.5% agarose gels stained in ethydium bromide.
Successful amplifications were digested with aTagl restriction enzyme in New England
Biolabs Buffer 3 with BSA. 5 ul of the restriction solution, containing 1 unit of enzyme, were
added to 20 ul of PCR product and incubated at 65°C for four hours. The product was run out on
3% agarose gels at 100V for two hours, then stained in ethydium bromide solution and
photographed.
I also amplified a sequence of approximately 650bp spanning part of 18s, internally
transcribed spacer (ITS) 1, 5.8s, ITS2, and part of 28s using the primers s-DINO (CGC TCC
TAC CGA TTG AGT GA) and DIR-rev (ATA TGC TTA AAT TCA GCG GGT). 25ul
reactions were performed on a DYADTM thermocycler (MJ Research) under the following
conditions: an initial denaturing at 92° for 3 minutes; 35 cycles of 92° for 30 seconds, 55° for 30
seconds, and 72° for 2 minutes; and a final extension at 72° for 5 minutes.
Cloning, DNA sequencing, and analysis
SSU amplifications from sample BB4 and ITS amplifications from samples BB4, PAS,
and PP6 were cloned in competent E. coli cells using the pGEM-TG vector kit from Promega.
The resulting colonies were then picked into strip tubes and screened for presence of the desired
sequence. Screens were run on a DYADTM thermocycler (MJ Research) using the vector primers
T7 and M13r under the following conditions: initial denaturing at 94° for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of
94° for 30 seconds, 55° for 30 seconds, and 72° for 1 minute 30 seconds, followed by a 5 minute
