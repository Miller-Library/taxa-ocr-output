be at least one anemone (MR8) containing each Symbiodinium type. The full data set is given in
Appendix I.
To test the possibility that the third, novel restriction pattern represented a new
Symbiodinium type, I cloned and sequenced SSU and ITS sequences from sample PAS, which
displays the new restriction pattern; and PP6, which doesn’t. Unfortunately, the resulting SSU
sequence fragments, ranging from 125 to 350bp, were too short to include any of the restriction
sites. ITS clones, which yielded sequences between 500 and 650bp, mostly clustered with an ITS
sequence from S. muscatinei obtained from GenBank (AF333510). While one cloned sequence
from PAS grouped outside this cluster, a 100-replicate bootstrap search does not show
significance (Fig 4).
Discussion
This study shows a clear shift in dinoflagellate symbiont types inhabiting A.
elegantissima on the California coast, and characterizes the primary transition zone between the
two major symbiont types as an approximately 240 kilometer section between latitudes N40° 24'
(Cape Mendecino) and N38° 23’ (Salt Point). This transition zone is not a gradual cline, showing
instead at least one alternation between northern- and southern-type symbiont communities. A
new RFLP profile endemic to the transition zone suggests but does not confirm the presence of
an undescribed Symbiodinium species inhabiting anemones in this transition zone.
While the large-scale results—specifically the loss of S. californium in anemones
between central California and Oregon—are consistent with previous observation (LaJeunesse
and Trench, 2000), the finer scale of sampling reveals a greater degree of complexity than was
previously understood.
