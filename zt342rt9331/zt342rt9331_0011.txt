populations within the transition zone did not follow a simple cline, instead displaying near-
ubiquitous S. californium presence at the north and south ends of the zone and complete absence
in the center. RFLP digests from anemones in the transition zone which lacked S. californium
displayed a new restriction pattern, suggesting the presence of a previously unknown
Symbiodinium type endemic to the transition zone.
