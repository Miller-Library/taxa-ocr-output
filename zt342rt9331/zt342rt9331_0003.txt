A. elegantissima also hosts at least two species of Symbiodinium zooxanthellae
(LaJeunesse and Trench 2000). S. muscatinei is found throughout A. elegantissima’s range from
southern California to northern Washington, while S. californium has been reported in
association with S. muscatinei only south of Carmel, California. These data suggest that
environmental factors may also account for variation of zooxanthellae type in A. elegantissima,
and the authors suggest temperature as the limiting factor. However, the large distance between
sample sites in that study limits the utility of the results. Knowledge of the biogeography of A.
elegantissima’s symbionts on a finer spatial scale could be useful in assessing the actual factors
involved in creating the variation described above, as well as tracking and predicting the effects
of changing environmental conditions on the Pacific coast.
In this study, I utilized the methods of LaJeunesse and Trench (2000) to develop a finer-
scale biogeography of A. elegantissima’s dinoflagellate symbionts. I sampled anemones at 30-80
kilometer intervals between Bodega Bay, CA and the Oregon border, amplified a portion of the
18s ribosomal gene using Symbiodinium specific primers, and characterized genotype using
RFLP analysis.
Methods and materials
Collecting
Tissue samples from 83 A. elegantissima were collected in May of 2005 between Pacific
Grove and the Oregon border. A small piece of tissue was taken from each anemone, ranging
from a few tentacles to a radial section, and preserved in 70% ethanol.
Specific locations included Pelican Point (PP; N41° 57’, W124° 12’); Wilson Creek
Beach (WC; N41° 36’, W124° 07’); Trinidad Head, north and south sides (TN and TS; N41° 02’,
