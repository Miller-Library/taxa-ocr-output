Figure 1. Symbiont populations of anemones on the Northern California coast. Pie graphs
illustrate relative abundance of each RFLP profile at each collecting site; pie size represents
sample size.
Figure 2. Three RFLP digests displaying the three different signatures. A) Northern symbiont
community; three bands indicate the sole presence of S. muscatinei. B) Southern symbiont
community C) Transitional symbiont community. Note the presence of additional bands
(arrowed) approximately 20-40 base pairs smaller than the two larger bands in a). This pattern is
indicative of S. muscatinei, possibly mixed with an unknown Symbiodinium type.
Figure 3. RFLP digests for anemones containing S. californium at two locations. A) Samples
from Bodega Bay. Note clear presence of a 129bp band, indicated by an arrow. B) Samples from
Shelter Cove, the northernmost location in which all samples harbored S. Californium. Note
absence of 129bp band and presence of a stronger band at around 110Obp, indicated by an arrow.
Figure 4. 100-replicate bootstrap tree of cloned ITS sequences from the symbiont populations of
anemones from Pigeon Point (PP6) and Point Arena (PA5). PP6 displays a typical S. muscatinei
RFLP signature. PA5 displays the intermediate, unknown RFLP signature in additions to the S.
muscatinei. Clone itsPA5-B7 may represent an additional Symbiodinium species.
