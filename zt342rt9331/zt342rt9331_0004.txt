W124° 08’); Humboldt Bay north jetty, interior and exterior (HI and HE; N40° 46’, W124° 14’);
Mattole Road on Cape Medocino (MR; N40° 24’, W124° 23’); Shelter Cove(SC; N40° 01’,
W124° 04’); Van Damme State Park, near Albion (AL; N39° 16’, W123° 47’); Point Arena Cove
(PA; N38° 54’, W123° 43’); Salt Point (SP; N38° 33’, W123° 20’); Bodega Bay (BB; N38° 19’,
W123° 04’); and Pacific Grove (PG; N36° 37’, W121° 37’). Preliminary analysis of Bodega Bay
specimens indicated the presence of S. californium, so no samples were taken between there and
Pacific Grove.
Between four and ten anemones were sampled at each site (Except PG, n-2). Samples at
each site were taken from different tide heights and light exposure levels, and where possible,
from different sides of potential biogeographic break points (e.g. Trinidad Head).
DNA Extraction, Amplification, and RFLP Analysis
I extracted DNA from the samples using a NucleoSpin6 spin-column kit from BD
Biosciences. Between 1 and 3 tentacles from each anemone were extracted according to
manufacturer instructions, except at half reagent volumes and spinning at 6000 rpm in a
microcentrifuge for every step except elution. Columns were eluted with 50 ul warmed elution
buffer as supplied in the kit and microcentrifuged at 3000 rpm for one minute.
PCR amplification of an approximately 1800bp piece of thel 8s Small Sub-Unit
ribosomal DNA (SSUFDNA) was performed using the following Symbiodinium-specific primers
developed by Rowan and Powers (1991): sssz (GCA GTT ATA RTT TAT TTG ATG GTY
RCT GCT AC) and ss3z (AGC ACT GCG TCA GTC CGA ATA ATT CAC CGG). 1:10
dilutions of the extracted genomic DNA were amplified in 25 ul reactions on a DYADTM
thermocycler (MJ Research) under the following conditions: an initial denaturing at 92°C for 3
