Introduction
The algal-cnidarian symbiosis offers an important example of the potential for nonÂ¬
genotypic adaptation in the natural world: current understanding suggests that multiple algal
symbiont species may exist in flexible, adaptive relationships with their cnidarian hosts
(Buddemeier and Fautin 1993; Baker 2003). These symbionts, dinoflagellates of the genus
Symbiodinium, represent an ancient and deeply diverged group (Rowan and Knowlton 1992;
Rowan 1998) in which closely related types can differ in their response to such important
environmental factors as temperature and irradiance (Rowan and Knowlton 1995; Savage et al.
2002; Baker 2003). While host-symbiont associations that exhibit high degrees of specificity
appear to be range-limited by the physiological limitations of their symbionts (lglesias-Prieto et
al. 2004), other, more flexible relationships may allow for greater and faster adaptation to
different environmental conditions (Rowan et al. 1997; Baker 2001).
The widely distributed temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima may use
symbiont-flexibility to exploit a range of ecological niches. In addition to dinoflagellate
zooxanthellae, A. elegantissima can host chlorophyte zoochlorellae (Muscatine 1971; Lewis and
Muller-Parker 2004). Zoochlorellae and zooxanthellae differ physiologically with respect to
temperature and irradiance (Verde and McCloskey 2001, 2002) and are associated with
anemones in different environments: zooxanthellate anemones are found preferentially in the
exposed upper intertidal, while zoochlorellate anemones tend to be in lower, shaded habitats
(McCloskey et al, 1996). In transplant experiments, aposymbiotic anemones grew symbiont
populations adapted to the local microhabitat (i.e. zooxanthellae in bright light, zoochlorellae in
partial light), suggesting that environmental factors can select for symbiont population type in A.
elegantissima (Secord and Muller-Parker, 2005).
