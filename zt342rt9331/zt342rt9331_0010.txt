coast intertidal species, the California mussel, have shown that interactions between tide timing,
wave splash, and terrestrial conditions can generate selectively significant "hot spots" at northern
latitudes (Helmuth et al., 2002). Such a phenomenon could account for the transition zone
observed in this study: Cape Mendecino could represent an area of reduced cold stress during the
most selectively important times, thus allowing for the presence of S. californium farther north
than a simple temperature gradient would predict.
This study also suggests, but does not confirm, the presence of a third Symbiodinium type
present in California A. elegantissima. The additional RFLP signal in some samples is difficult to
explain by poor amplification because of the clarity and uniformity of the bands, and because of
the geographic consistency of the signal. However, the smaller size of both new bands implies
the presence of a third new band, potentially in the 300-400bp range, which is not visible in any
of the digests. Sequence analysis, if consistent with the new RFLP signal, should provide ample
evidence either way. More extensive molecular investigation will be required, but if
substantiated as an additional member of the A. elegantissima symbiont group, this third type
would be unique in its limited range.
Conclusion
In this study, I used RFLP analysis of 18S Small Subunit Ribosomal DNA to assess the
previously undescribed fine scale biogeography of Symbiodinium species in symbiotic
relationships with Anthopleura elegantissima on the California coast. Results were consistent
with a single species (Symbiodinium muscatinei) inhabiting all anemones, with a second species
(S. californium) found only in southern hosts. The transition appeared to take place between
Cape Mendocino and Salt Point, a distance of approximately 240 kilometers. Symbiont
