Abstract
The algal-cnidarian symbiosis is a useful system for investigating patterns of selection
and adaptation different from standard single-organism models. Current research, mostly focused
on tropical ecosystems, indicates that the host/symbiont relationship can be flexible: hosts can
house different symbionts under different conditions. This flexibility may allow for adaptation of
the entire symbiotic system (holosymbiont) rather than the individual players. However, less is
known about the behavior of temperate algal-cnidarian systems. In this study, 1 examine the fine
scale dinoflagellate symbiont biogeography in the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura
elegantissimam, as first observed by LaJeunesse and Trench (2000). Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA indicates a
complex transition zone from Cape Mendecino (N40° 24’, W124° 23’) to Salt Point (N38° 33’,
W123° 20’), with anemones to the north harboring Symbiodinium muscatinei and those to the
south co-harboring S. muscatinei and S. californium. S. californium is present in the north and
south of the transition zone, but absent from the center. A new RFLP signature was found in
anemones from the center of the transition zone, suggesting the presence of a third dinoflagellate
species endemic to that area.
