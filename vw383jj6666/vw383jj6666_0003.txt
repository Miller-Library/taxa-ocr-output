We began our investigation of the changes associated with the development of
swimming activity in larval bonito by examining swimming behavior, labeling
motoneurons using the fluorescent dye Dil, and using EMG analysis to study muscle
activity. We show that development of bonito swimming is associated with rapid
development of the motoneuron system and muscle activity which correlates to the
swimming mode exhibited.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Larval bonito were obtained courtesy of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Day 2
through 6 fish used in the behavior and motoneuron dye injections were fertilized on 25
April and raised at 26.5°C +-0.5°. The fish used for days 7 through 13 in the behavior
and in the motoneuron dye injections were obtained from a separate hatching. These fish
were fertilized on 30 April and raised at 22.5°C +-0.5°. The fish used in the EMG
recordings were fertilized on 19 May and raised at 22.5°C +0.5°. On day 7 of
development for this population, the population died out and we were unable to obtain fish
to finish the time course of development for EMG recordings. The motoneuron dye
injections for the day 4 fish was also obtained from this last population, since earlier
attempts for motoneuron labeling had been unsuccessful.
Error may have occurred in experiments performed on days 2 through 6 fish, which
were raised at a higher temperature the other stocks of bonito larvae observed (26°C versus
22°C). The effects of temperature on bonito larval development have not been fully
investigated, though preliminary studies indicate that under optimal feeding conditions
increased temperature may lead to more rapid behavioral development.
Swimming Behavior
A rotating drum was constructed using a plastic bucket with a 29 cm diameter. The
interior was painted white, and the exterior wrapped in black gaffing tape. Black stripes
were placed on the interior of the drum using black electrical tape. Each black stripe was
