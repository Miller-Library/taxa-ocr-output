dpf. At Stage 7, the fish were completely opaque and approximately 2 cm in length. Stage
7 generally began at 15 dpf.
Swimming Behavior
Stage 1 fish spent the majority of their time inactive, interrupted by short bursts of
activity. These short periods of activity typically consisted of short, rapid forward
swimming propulsions or quick tight circling, both produced primarily by movements of
the trunk. By Stage 2, the fish were swimming more consistently and began to perform
graded turns, where the head moved first followed by the rest of the body. Locomotive
behavior appeared to involve use of the full tail as well as the trunk. Sustained swimming
periods were more common by Stage 3. These periods of steady swimming were often
interrupted by short, rapid forward swimming propulsions. Turns were consistently
performed by movement of the head first followed by the tail. In Stage 3, a new behavior
termed "hovering" was exhibited, where a fish displayed repeated tail flicks but did not
translate in any direction. Locomotion appeared to be controlled both by use of the entire
trunk and the tip of the tail alone. Stage 4 fish swam nearly constantly, with short periods
of inactivity. Hovering was performed using the tip of the tail, and accelerated swimming
was achieved using the full tail and trunk.
Optokinetic Response
Attempts to quantify an optokinetic response in the day 7 and 8 fish were
unsuccessful. It did appear that older fish which were stationary oriented towards the
rotating drum by pivoting in place, although they did not respond to the drum in a
stereotyped manner if they were actively swimming.
Activity
A trend was seen for increase in activity with development (Fig. 5). Peaks of
activity were seen on days 3, 8, and 12, but the overall time spent active increased over the
12-day period.
