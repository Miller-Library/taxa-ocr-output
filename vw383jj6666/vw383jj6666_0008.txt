No significant trend was seen in the change of the maximum body flexion for the
bonito throughout the 12 day developmental period studied (Fig. 6). The data was
quantified using regression analysis (n-5, r-0.26, F-18.4), which indicated that the
difference of the degree of flexion throughout the larval developmental period was not
statistically significant.
Motoneuron Dye Injections
Over the larval developmental period, the number of cell bodies per segment
increased from less than 10 to over 30. We noted that motoneurons could be classified into
two different types, dependent on morphology. Type A, which was seen more
consistently, was characterized by uniform branching of cell bodies off the main ventral
root, while Type B motoneurons were characterized by more erratic branching off the main
ventral root and greater secondary branching (Fig. 7).
We also noted that motoneurons appeared to occur in tiers, with only one tier
occurring in the Stage 1 fish (Fig. 8A). Beginning with Stage 3, two tiers of the Type A
motoneuron cells were seen, with the second tier of cells being smaller in size (Fig. 8B).
In a mid Stage 3 fish, three tiers of cells were observed. The third tier of cells occurred just
caudal to the gut and was composed of small Type B cells (Fig 8C, Fig. 9). We were not
able to identify a third tier of cells in later stage fish. By the end of Stage 4, the tiers of cell
bodies were no longer distinctly layered, nor was there a distinct difference in the size of
the cell bodies (Fig. 8D).
Motoneuron development first took place in the more rostral segments of the fish,
with the number and complexity of the motoneurons decreasing towards the caudal
segments. At later stages, the number and complexity of the caudal motoneurons increased
(Fig. 10).
EMG Recordings
Late Stage 1 fish displayed a quick burst of electrical activity. Each spike lasted
about 7 ms and occurred at a frequency of 142 Hz. The total duration of this activity
