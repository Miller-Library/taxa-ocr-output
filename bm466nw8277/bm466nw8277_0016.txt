1996. Thus, determinants of barnacle population size other than upwelling and El Ninno
should be considered when investigating yearly variation in recruitment.
Several inconsistencies exist in my results and procedure. Most apparent is the
discrepancy between daily recruitment in the mid intertidal and high intertidal (Fig.11).
Although settlement varies with tidal height (Grossberg 1982), the difference I observed
is extreme, and the relative amount of recruitment between sites varies with tidal height.
One partial explanation is that the high intertidal zone plates at Pescadero were 1.9 m
above MLLW, and may not have been submerged on all tidal cycles during my sampling
period, leading to low values for high intertidal recruitment at that site.
Three more inconsistencies should be noted. Correlations between recruitment
and SST and salinity were run for May, but did not include days in April and the
recruitment pulse at Pescadero. Secondly, when daily wind data at buoy 46042 become
available for May 1998, these data (rather than data from Ml) should be used to compare
1998 north wind patterns to 1988-97 wind data from buoy 46042. Finally, recruitment at
Pescadero in the mid intertidal zone may have been underestimated. Simply adding
recruitment during two consecutive 14 day intervals may underestimate monthly
recruitment. Recruits appeared to settle near older barnacles on the plates, and fresh
plates like the ones set out on May 15th probably discourage recruitment.
A major limitation of this study was that I was able to collect data only for May,
although I attempted to make generalizations and comparisons to the entire April-June
upwelling season. More data from June 1998 would help determine whether
recruitment in 1998 is actually higher than usual, and whether this is true across sites.
Monitoring recruitment in June might also further strengthen the correlation between
