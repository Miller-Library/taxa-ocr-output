1996-7 (Figure 8, Table 2). At Pescadero, recruitment in May 1998 was significantly
greater than only two of six months in April-May 1996-7 (Figure 9, Table 3). Overall,
out of six comparisons with the non-El Ninno year 1996, recruitment in May 1998 was
greater in only two cases. Of six comparisons with the early-El Ninno year 1997,
recruitment in May 1998 was greater in only three cases. It can not be conclusively
shown that during the El Ninno recruitment to Pescadero and Waddell Beach increased
above recruitment in a non-El Ninno or early El Ninno year.
Barnacle Reproductive Output
B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. were found to be reproductive during the study
period. Between 13% and 32% of B. glandula and 52-66% of Chthamalus spp. were
brooding larvae when I removed them from the rocks at each site (Fig.10). Only B.
glandula at Pescadero were brooding at levels lower than found by Hines in May 1973-4
(1978) or Miller in 1989-90 (1992).
Discussion:
The close correlation that I found between recruitment and sea surface
temperature and salinity suggests that recruitment during May 1998 occurred
during periods of relaxation. The three instances of co-occurring recruitment and
relaxation that I observed suggest that El Ninno recruitment occurs during relaxation, as
proposed by Roughgarden et al. (1988) for non-El Nino years.
My two-day interval plates at Asilomar were placed at the exact location used by
Roughgarden and Shkedy (1997), who found that during the 1991 El Nino SST at GC did
