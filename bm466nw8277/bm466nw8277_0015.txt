adult barnacles. Glynn (1988) noted declines in barnacle populations in Peru during
severe nutrient depletion in the 1982-3 El Ninno.
Since I found that adult barnacles at my sites were brooding at rates similar to
those seen in non-El Ninno years, larval mortality seems more likely than
adult reproductive failure. Lang and Marcy (1982) found that nauplii of B. improvisus
completely deprived of food died within seven days. Nauplii deprived of food for even
only one day showed impaired swimming. Glynn (1988) noted that several researcher:
found that nitrogen depletion severely affected kelp late in the 1982-3 El Nino. If nitrogen
availability decreased as the 1997-8 El Ninno progressed, and if this led to decreased food
availability for barnacles, it could explain the higher recruitment in 1997 compared to
1998.
One possibility for testing the hypothesis of increased larval mortality would be to
compare plankton samples from the top 1 m in 1998 to those from 1997. If larval
mortality was higher in 1998, fewer late-stage nauplii should be present. Plankton
samples may be available from the California Cooperative Ocean Fisheries Investigation
(CalCOFI), which conducted surface plankton tows in April and May 1998 off Monterey.
The increased recruitment seen along the central California coast in 1997
compared to 1996 could also have been due to factors unrelated to the El Nino. Gaines
and Roughgarden (1987) suggested that rockfish predation is a major source of mortality
for barnacle larvae. If yearly fluctuations in rockfish populations are fairly uniform along
the central coast, it is possible that a strong rockfish year class in 1996 caused decreased
barnacle recruitment below typical levels. Alternatively, coastal storms or currents
unrelated to upwelling may have trapped larvae offshore or limited food resources in
