Introduction
Along the central coast of California, the dominant animals of the upper intertidal
zone are the acorn barnacles Balanus glandula, Chthamalus dalli, and Chthamalus
fissus. B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. are cross-fertilizing hermaphrodites (Light
1975). Adults brood nauplii larvae within their shell, and then release the nauplii into
the top meter of the water column. Äfter about 14 days, the nauplii metamorphose into
cyprid larvae. Äfter another 14 day period, cyprids settle onto rocky substrate and
metamorphose into adults. Primarily because of mortality suffered during the pelagic
larval phases, recruitment of larvae to the shore is highly variable. Recruitment is
influenced both by biotic factors (Gaines and Roughgarden 1987) and oceanographic
factors such as surface currents driven by coastal upwelling (Roughgarden et al 1988,
Roughgarden et al. 1991, Shkedy and Roughgarden 1997, Farrell et al. 1991 ) .
Upwelling along the central California coast is particularly apparent in the spring,
when strong northerly winds drive surface water directly offshore by Ekman transport
(Gross 1987). In typical years, cold, saline upwelled water flows from below the
thermocline to replace the warmer water pushed offshore by Ekman transport. Rosenfeld
et al (1994) found the frontal boundary between cold upwelled water and warmer oceanic
water to be located 15-20 km off Santa Cruz during a period of upwelling in May 1989
Periods of decreased north wind cause reduced Ekman transport. This decreases
the force trapping coastal water against the offshore front. During this relaxation of north
wind, warm oceanic water moves rapidly towards shore. At the shore, cold saline
upwelled water is replaced by warmer less saline oceanic or California Current water.
