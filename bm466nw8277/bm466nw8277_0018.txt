upwelling and frontal movement. F. Schwing from the NOAA Pacific Fisheries
Environmental Laboratory offered valuable direction and resources linking oceanography
and recruitment. R. Polk's assistance measuring tidal heights was greatly appreciated, as
was K. Ludwig's help identifying substrate types. K. Gray, A. Fong, and D. Hansen from
the California Dept. of Parks and Recreation provided assistance with collection permits.
J. Carpenter's knowledge of Asilomar Beach helped uncover previous study sites.
