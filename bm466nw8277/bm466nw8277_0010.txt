Barnacle Reproductive Output
To determine whether B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. were reproductive during
the study period, I collected between 147 and 223 barnacles from the substrate at each
site. In all cases barnacles were collected on at least three separate days from at least
three rocks per day. Chthamalus spp. were approximately 3 mm in diameter. B. glandula
from Waddell Beach and Asilomar were from 4-10 mm, and those from Pescadero were
from 4-8mm. I then used a Wild M5 dissecting scope at 50x magnification to identify the
barnacles and to determine whether they had larvae brooded within their shells.

Correlating Recruitment and Relaxation of Upwelling
Recruitment monitoring on two and four day intervals showed three recruitment
pulses (Fig.5). The largest pulse occurred on April 27th at Waddell Beach, with an
average of over 100 barnacles plate"2 days". This pulse was recorded on plates set out
for two days in the mid intertidal during preliminary sampling. Tobserved two smaller
pulses of recruitment in the high intertidal at Asilomar. These pulses averaged less than
12 barnacles plate“ 2 days 1, on the 1 1th and 17th of April.
All three pulses of recruitment occurred during or just after periods of sea surface
warming and decreased north wind, suggesting that recruitment occurred during
relaxations of upwelling (Fig 6). Sea surface temperature from MI was above 12.5°C on
April 27th, and above 13.5°C two days before recruitment occurred on the IIth, and on
the 17th. Data from GC (REINAS 1998) also show periods of elevated SST from three
