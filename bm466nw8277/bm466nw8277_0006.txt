surface temperature for two cloud-free days on April 26th and 27th (UCSD Coastwatch
1998) showed cold upwelled water from Änno Nuevo touching the shore at both
Pescadero and Waddell Beach. The bulk of this water billowed offshore and southward
in a plume 40 km long. Asilomar is not reported to lie within an upwelling plume by
Rosenfeld et al (1994). This is supported by satellite sea surface temperature images for
the period from April 27th-May 28th 1998 (Figs. 2-4). Miller (1992) noted that there is
a general gradient of increasing upwelling from San Francisco to Pt. Sur (south of
Asilomar), possibly due to the greater size of the Pt. Sur plume compared to the Ano
Nuevo plume.
Correlating Recruitment and Relaxation of Upwelling
I monitored barnacle recruitment to the high intertidal zone at Pescadero, Waddell
Beach, and Asilomar. I sampled recruitment on two day intervals at Asilomar, and every
four days at Waddell Beach and Pescadero. Sampling began during the last week of
April, 1998 and continued through May 28th, 1998.
At each site, I used wall anchors and screws to attach six to seven recruitment
plates to the rocks in the upper intertidal zone. Recruitment plates were made of
5x1Ocm 7 mm thick acrylic. Each plate was covered with gray Safety Walk tape (3M
Co., St. Paul MN), which was replaced after each sampling interval. I placed the plates
between .75 and 2.5m above mean lower low water (MLLW), approximately in the
middle of the barnacle-Endocladia zone. Üpper intertidal zone plates were intended for
comparison with data from Farrell (1991).
