Fig. 1. chart of the central California Coast. Recruitment sites at Asilomar and
Pescadero are labeled. The Waddell Beach site is between Davenport and
Anno Nuevo. NOAA buoy 46042 is labelled. The MBARI MI buoy is directly

Fig.2. AVHRR SST images from May 9th. The image is of the central California coast,
roughly from Pt. Reyes to Pt. Piedras Blancas. Blue indicates cold upwelled
water, and green is warmer oceanic and California current water. Black areas to
to the west of the coast are areas covered by clouds. May 9th is a period of strong
upwelling, with plumes visible at Pt. Sur, Anno Nuevo, and Pt. Reyes. Upwelling
plumes generally extend southwest from the headlands.Note the Anno Nuevo
plume extending across the mouth of Monterey Bay.
Fig.3. AVHRR SST images of the April 15th-17th 1998 period of relaxation of
upwelling. Warm water above 13Â°C has reached the coast. Upwelling plumes at
Anno Nuevo and Pt. Sur have disappeared, and the plume at Pt. Reyes is greatly
reduced.
