I removed recruitment plates from the rocks and scored them for barnacle
cyprids and juveniles, using a Wild M5 dissecting scope at 25x magnification. I
identified Balanus glandula to the species level, and Chthamalus to the genus level,
following the identification methods of Miller (1992), and Connolly (pers. comm.).
I attempted to identify periods of relaxation during May 1998 that might co¬
occur with recruitment pulses. To detect relaxation events, l'used surface buoys, shore
stations, and AVHRR, similar to the methods used by Rosenfeld et al. (1994), Miller
(1992), and Farrell et al. (1991). Sea surface temperature, salinity, and wind velocity
data were made available by the National Marine Fisheries Service from the Granite
Canyon Fisheries CTD and surface meteorological station (1998) (hereafter GC).
Additional wind velocity and sea surface temperature was used from the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute buoy MI (MBARI 1998) (hereafter Ml). I analyzed
satellite sea surface temperature (SST) maps for cloud-free days from NOAA 12 and
NOAA 14 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometry (AVHRR), made available by
the UCSD Coastwatch Program (1988) and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(1998).
I expected that buoy and shore wind sensors would represent sea and wind
conditions at my three study sites. If periods of low north wind stress led to relaxation
events, I expected that first the offshore buoy in Monterey Bay (Ml) and then the near
shore buoy (GC) would record temperatures above 13.5°C due to oceanic water
collapsing back onto the shore.
To test for relationships between recruitment and signals of relaxation, 1 ran
Pearson correlations of recruitment at each site with SST and salinity at Granite Canyon
