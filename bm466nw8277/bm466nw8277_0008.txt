(REINAS 1998) and SST at buoy MI (REINAS 1998) (Sokal and Rohlf 1995). A cross
correlation function was run to determine the time lag of SST and salinity around
recruitment that would maximize the correlation coefficient. I analyzed all data using
SPSS Systat v. 6.01.
Frequency and Duration of Relaxation Events
I compared the frequency and duration of relaxation events in May 1998 to
relaxations typical of the last 10 years. Mean daily north wind strength from 1988-1997
were available from NÃ–AA buoy No. 46042, located between Monterey and Santa Cruz
(NOAA 1998). These wind data allowed me to define relaxation using a parameter based
on north wind strength. Since north winds drive upwelling, I arbitrarily defined a
relaxation event (cessation of upwelling) as any period with no north wind component. I
used MATLAB Student v.4 (The Mathworks, 1994) to indicate which days had no north
wind component during April-June 1988-1997. I processed data from April -June,
rather than May only, because Connolly and Roughgarden (1998) showed the delivery of
larvae to be highly variable between months at Pescadero and Waddell Beach. Including
April and June also allowed me to compare May 1998 to three months with similar
upwelling-season oceanography.
The pattern of relaxations (defined by a decrease in north wind) in April-June
1988-1997 was qualitatively compared to the relaxation events indicated by wind sensors
at MI during May 1998. Wind measurements at MI were taken on approximately 30
minute intervals, and mean daily velocity was not available. I defined a relaxation at MI
to be any day(s) during which no wind measurement contained a north wind component.
