year with low upwelling indices and decreased northerly winds. Most recently, Connolly
and Roughgarden (1998) found that recruitment for May-September of 1997 was
significantly higher than during the same period in 1996, and that in four of nine study
sites on the central California coast recruitment increased by an order of magnitude in
1997 compared to 1996. They suggested that increased recruitment could have been due
to three factors: reduced offshore transport of larvae due to a weakening of northerly
winds caused by a strengthened Aleutian low pressure system in the North Pacific; an
eastward shift in the California current that trapped larvae near shore; or reduced offshore
transport of water caused by northward-propagating coastally-trapped waves.
May of 1998 offered an opportunity to further investigate the effect of El Ninno on
recruitment. The 1997-1998 El Ninno first appeared in the tropics in March 1997 (UCSD
CoastWatch, El Ninno Advisory, March 1997). By May sea temperatures were 3-4
degrees above normal off central California. Upwelling in May, August, and November
was at least one standard deviation below the historical mean for these months. Sea
surface temperature anomalies persisted at least through April 1998 and were predicted
to continue until June or July (UCSD CoastWatch, El Ninno Advisory, 1998). Upwelling
index was normal at 36Â°N latitude for January and February of 1998, but .5 standard
deviation below the mean for April.
Since the El Nino continued through the spring of 1998, 1 was interested in
determining its influence on coastal upwelling, and any resulting influence on larval
recruitment. There were three questions that I attempted to address. First, 1 wanted to
determine whether recruitment during the 1998 El Ninno occurred during relaxations of
upwelling, as suggested by Roughgarden et al. (1988) for non- El Nino years. Secondly, I
