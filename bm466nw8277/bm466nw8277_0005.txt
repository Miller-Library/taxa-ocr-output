wanted to know whether there was an increase in the frequency or duration of relaxation
events in May 1998 compared to typical conditions. Finally, if recruitment occurred
during relaxation events, and if there were an increase in relaxation during May 1998
compared to typical years, I wanted to test whether overall recruitment was significantly
higher in May 1998 than during non -El Ninno years.
Methods and Materials
Study Sites
I monitored recruitment at three open-coast sites in central California:
Pescadero Beach (36° 14'N, 122° 24' W, hereafter Pescadero), Waddell Beach (37° 04
N, 122° 15'W), and Asilomar Beach (36 ° 37'N, 121° 56’, hereafter Asilomar).
Pescadero and Waddell Beach are between San Francisco and the northern edge of
Monterey Bay, and Asilomar is located just south of Monterey Bay (Fig. 1).
These sites have similar intertidal barnacle communities of B. glandula,
Chthamalus spp., and Tetraclita squamosa rubescens. All three sites contain
communities with high abundances of the mussels Mytilus californianus, and algae
species including Endocladia muricata, Mastocarpus papillatus, and Prionitis
lanceolata. The three sites receive direct wave impact, but swells and surf at Pescadero
and Asilomar typically were higher than at Waddell Beach. Pescadero has sandstone
substrate, at Waddell Beach the substrate is siltstone or mudstone, and at Asilomar the
substrate is a granite/feldspar mix.
Rosenfeld et al. (1994) have shown that Anno Nuevo, located south of Pescadero
and north of Waddell Beach, is a region of intense upwelling. AVHRR images of sea
