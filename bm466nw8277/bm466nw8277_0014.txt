not accurately predict recruitment. Contrary to this, SST at MI and GC during May
1998 explained 59.3% and 60.4% of the variance in recruitment. This disparity could be
explained by the presence of a deeper mixed layer in 1991, which would result in
upwelling of warm water from above the thermocline. This would tend to cancel out the
cold water signal that characterizes upwelling when the mixed layer is shallower. This
hypothesis could be tested by comparing CTD casts in 1991 to those from 1998.
Connolly and Roughgarden (1998) have suggested that the 1997-8 El Nino caused
increased recruitment to the central California coast, possibly by decreasing the
prevalence of upwelling-favorable northerly winds . My data from buoy 46042 show that
northerly winds were less frequent than normal in May 1998. An analysis of north wind
component patterns for the entire upwelling season in 1997 and 1998 could further test
this hypothesis of decreased upwelling-favorable winds.
Recruitment at Pescadero and Waddell Beach in 1998 was not significantly
greater than in the non-El Ninno year 1996. Recruitment at Asilomar was lower in 1998
than in the non-El Ninno period April-October 1988 (.0157 recruits plate ’day“ for 1998
vs. approximately .053 recruits plate" day" for 1988) (Farrell 1991).
It is possible that recruitment in central California was actually higher in 1998
than in non El Nino years, but that my limited sampling time or limited number of sites
prevented me from detecting this trend. Alternatively, the increase in relaxation during
May of 1998 may have been countered by a shortage of food availability for adults or
nauplii, leading to decreased reproductive output or increased larval mortality. The effect
of either would be a loss of recruitment that could lead to lower overall abundances of
