Fig.4. AVHRR SST image during May 22nd, 1998. After the May 15th-17th relaxation
event, upwelling increased. The plumes of upwelled water are once again visible
as blue bands extending up to 40 km from the headlands.
Fig.5. April 27th-May28th 1998 recruitment to Asilomar, Pescadero, and Waddell Creek
measured on 2 day intervals (Asilomar) and 4-day intervals (Pescadero and
Waddell Creek). The data point for Pescadero on April 27th is from the mid
intertidal, all other data are from the high intertidal. The y-axis uses a log scale,
mean number of recruits of B. glandula and Chthamalus
and represents
plate per day. Average recruitment during May only was 3.02 recruits
spp. per
plate day at Asilomar, 38 recruits plate day at Waddell Beach, and 07 recruits
plate day at Pescadero.
Fig.6. Oceanographic conditions April 27th-May 28th, combined with recruitment at
Asilomar, Pescadero, and Waddell Beach. "Salt" is salinity at GC, which varies
between 30.4 and 30.7 psu. "GC" is SST at Granite Canyon. "Ml" is SST at the
MBARI MI buoy. SST varies from 10 to 14° C.
Fig.7. Asilomar high intertidal recruitment, SST at GC and Ml, and salinity. The
correlation is for recruitment Maylst through May 28th. Salinity: r-=-.593;
GC SST: r’=.604; MI SST: r’=.593.
