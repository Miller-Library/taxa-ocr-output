the fact that MI and GC were closer to Asilomar than to Waddell Creek or Pescadero, or
the general lack of recruitment to the high intertidal at those sites during May.
Frequency and Duration of Relaxation Events
Using wind data from Ml, I identified nine days in May 1998 with no north wind
component. These days occurred in a four day and five day period (May 6th-lOth, and
16th-19th). These were likely periods of relaxation, and they preceded or overlapped
with periods of increased SST at Ml and GC (Fig. 6).
Analysis of wind data from NOAA buoy 46042 in April-June 1988-1997 showed
that it is not unusual to have two relaxation events per month, but that it is unusual to
total nine or more days of relaxation in a month (Table 1). Only five of 30 months had
nine or more days without north wind component in daily wind velocity. Furthermore,
only one of those months (May 1993) had more than four consecutive days of relaxation.
Most relaxation events (10 of 13) had a duration of less than four days.
Changes in Monthly Recruitment
Recruitment to the mid intertidal at Waddell Beach was 654+212.1 (mean + s.d.)
recruits plate monthâ€œ. Monthly recruitment to Pescadero, estimated by summing the
recruitment in two 14 day sampling intervals, was 101.9-54.5 recruits plate
month".
May 1998 recruitment at Waddell Beach and Pescadero was not conclusively
greater than recruitment during April-June 1996 or 1997. At Waddell Beach, May
1998 had significantly greater recruitment than only three of the six months in April-June
