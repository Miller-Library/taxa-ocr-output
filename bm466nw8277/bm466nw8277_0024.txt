Recruitment in May 1998 significanty greater than in April 1997, June 1996, and
May 1997. Note that for April and June 1997, recruitment at these sites did not
increase above 1996 levels, suggesting that increases to recruitment
occured primarily later in that year after the El Nino developed.
1996-7 data from Connolly and Roughgarden (1998).

Recruitment in May 1998 significanty greater than April 1996 and June 1997.
Here, similar to Waddell Beach, recruitment in April, May, and June 1997 was
not higher than during those three months in 1996. 1996-7 data from Connolly
and Roughgarden (1998).
Fig. 10. Fraction of adult B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. brooding at each of three
sites. NÂ°146 at each site. I collected barnacles in late May 1998. At Pescadero
fewer B. glandula appeared to be reproductively active than at other sites.
Fig.11. Daily mean recruitment in the high and mid intertidal at three sites. This
graph illustrates inconsistencies in the data. At Asilomar, the high intertidal
had the highest recruitment, while at the other two sites the mid intertidal
zone had higher recruitment. Asilomar had the most recruiment in the
high intertidal, but Waddell Beach had the most in the mid intertidal.
