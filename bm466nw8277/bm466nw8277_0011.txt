to five days before the recruitment events. One to four days before the May 1Ith and 17th
recruitment events, wind at Ml was from the east, with no north wind component.
AVHRR images confirmed the April 27th and May 17th periods of relaxation.
obtained twelve cloud-free or partially cloud-free AVHRR SST images from UCSD
Coastwatch (1998) and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (1998) for the period
from April 25th to May 22nd. On April 25th there were strong, broad plumes of cold
water at Pt. Sur and Anno Nuevo, extending about 40 km southwest of each point. The
Ano Nuevo plume swept southward across the mouth of Monterey Bay. These plumes
decreased on April 26th and 27th, but appeared to be moderate in size again by May 9th
(Fig. 2). Two images from May 15th and one from May 17th show that the Ano Nuevo
and Pt. Sur plumes were greatly reduced on these days. Warm water above 13° C was up
against most of the coast from Pt. Sur to San Francisco, and the Änno Nuevo plume did
not extend down to the mouth of Monterey Bay (Fig. 3). On May 19th through 22nd, the
Pt. Sur and Anno Nuevo plumes were again -40 km in length, and the Ano Nuevo
plume sealed off the mouth of Monterey Bay (Fig. 4).
Recruitment pulses at Asilomar were well correlated with SST and salinity at GC
and MI (Fig.7), further suggesting that recruitment occurred during relaxation. The best
Pearson correlation between recruitment and SST at Ml and GC occurred when
recruitment was paired with SST from three days earlier (Ml: r’=.593, n-31; GC:
r’=.604, n=32) (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). The best negative correlation between
recruitment and salinity at GC occurred with recruitment lagged four days after salinity
(r’=-.593, n=32). There was no significant and meaningful correlation between SST or
salinity and May recruitment at Pescadero or Waddell Beach. This may be explained by
