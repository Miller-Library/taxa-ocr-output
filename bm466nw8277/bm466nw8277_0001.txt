Abstract:
I monitored recruitment of the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus spp.
to the intertidal zone at three sites in central California. The sampling period was April
27th-May 28th 1998, during the strong 1997-8 El Nino. The results showed that one large
pulse of recruitment occurred at Waddell Beach during a relaxation of coastal upwelling
in April. Two smaller recruitment events occurred at Asilomar beach during two periods
of relaxation in May. There was a significant correlation of recruitment with sea surface
temperature at two moored buoys (r’=.593, r’=.604) and salinity (r’=-593). Buoy
observations of north wind velocity and sea surface temperature showed that the two
periods of reduced upwelling in May totaled nine days. Only five months during April
through June 1988-1997 had nine or more days without upwelling-favorable north winds.
This suggests that one effect of the El Nino on the central California coast may have been
to decrease upwelling favorable winds. Recruitment of barnacle larvae is thought to
occur during periods of decreased northerly winds and the subsequent relaxation of
upwelling. However, I could not conclusively say that recruitment at Waddell Beach or
Pescadero Beach was significantly greater in May 1998 than in April-June 1996-7.
