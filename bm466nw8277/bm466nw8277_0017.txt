recruitment and relaxation of upwelling. Monitoring relaxation of upwelling in June
could support the suggestion that the duration of relaxation events has increased in 1998
compared to non-El Ninno years
Each of the three relaxation events delivered larvae to only one of the three sites I
studied. Future work could attempt to identify why certain relaxation events deliver
larvae to certain sites. One possibility is that the amount of north wind varies between
sites, and therefore leads to site-to-site differences in the strength of upwelling. If
accurate data on daily wind velocity near each site are available, it may be possible to
calculate the amount of upwelling or relaxation occurring at that site. J. Paduan (pers.
comm.) has suggested that accurate measurements of alongshore wind stress, derived
from measurements of north wind velocity, could be used to predict the relaxation of
upwelling and the arrival of warm water to shore. This might help determine whether it
is differences in upwelling that causes differences in recruitment between sites, or
whether other oceanographic or biotic factors are at work.

J. Watanabe served as my mentor for this project. His daily encouragement and
questions, field assistance during dawn trips to Pescadero, and patient editing and
explanations of SYSTAT made research seem human, approachable, and understandable
S. Connolly introduced me to the study of barnacles in 1996, and continued to help me
with all aspects of this work, from identifying cyprids to editing parts of the manuscript.
He also made his recruitment data from two years of research available for my use. J.
Paduan of the Naval Postgraduate School provided expertise on the oceanography of
