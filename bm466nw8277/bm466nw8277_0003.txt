During one of these relaxation events in May 1989, Rosenfeld et al. (1994) found sea
surface temperatures to increase above 13.5Â° and salinity to decrease to 33.4 psu.
Rosenfeld et al. (1994) used several methods to detect relaxation,
including moored offshore buoys and shore stations with sensors for sea surface
temperature and salinity. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometry (AVHRR)
satellite imaging of sea surface temperature images was also used by Rosenfeld et al
(1994) and Miller (1992) to track the shoreward movement of warm oceanic water during
these periods of relaxation. Farrell (1991) and Miller (1992) measured the north
component of wind velocity, assuming that a decrease in north wind would lead to
decreased Ekman transport and a resulting relaxation event.
Miller (1992) and others (Roughgarden et al. 1988, Farrell et al. 1991,
Roughgarden et al. 1991) hypothesized that during periods of upwelling barnacle larvae
are carried offshore by surface currents. Larvae collect at the frontal boundary between
cold upwelled water and warmer oceanic or California current water. During relaxation
of upwelling, larvae are transported to shore and recruit into adult populations. Shkedy
and Roughgarden (1997) found a close correlation between sea surface temperature and
recruitment. A polynomial regression of sea surface temperature explained 47.48% of
the variance in recruitment.
The effects on recruitment of an El Ninno such as the one seen in 1997-1998 have
not been determined. Shkedy and Roughgarden (1997) found that overall recruitment in
the 1992 El Ninno was not only lower than predicted by SST, but also lower than in the
non- El Ninno years 1989 and 1990. However, during the 1982-83 El Ninno,
Roughgarden et al. (1988) found unusually high recruitment to the intertidal zone in a
