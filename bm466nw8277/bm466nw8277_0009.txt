The periods of relaxation indicated by lack of north wind stress at Ml were confirmed
with SST data at Ml and GC.
Testing for Changes in Monthly Recruitment
To test for an increase in recruitment in 1998 over 1996 and 1997 I installed six
recruitment plates in the mid intertidal zone at Pescadero and Waddell Beach. The plates,
installation methods, and species identification methods were similar to those used for the
high intertidal zone (see above). I placed mid intertidal zone plates between .75 and 1.9 m
above MLLW, which was within one-half meter of the lower limit of the mussel beds. I
installed the plates on April 27th. I collected the Waddell Beach plates on May 28th. 1
collected and replaced the Pescadero plates on May 15th due to partial fouling of the
plates by algae. I recovered the second set of plates at Pescadero on May 28th.
For both Pescadero and Waddell Beach, I compared May 1998 recruitment in the
mid intertidal zone to the recruitment found by Connolly and Roughgarden (1998) in
April-June 1996 and 1997. April-June 1996 was during a non-El Nino year, and
April-June 1997 was at the beginning of the strong 1997-8 El Nino. The comparison
used a Model I single factor ANOVA . Data were log transformed to account for
heterogeneity of the variances. Post hoc tests were conducted using Tukey's test with a
Bonferonni correction (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). I used SPSS Systat v. 6.01 for all
statistical analysis.
