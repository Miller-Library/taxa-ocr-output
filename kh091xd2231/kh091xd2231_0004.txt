a given size, there is a considerable variation in the
number of eggs carried. In the intertidal region there
Were no gravid P. granosimanus found larger than 11.5 mi
or smaller than 7.0 mm, although non-gravid females and
males of these sizes were present.
However, one sample of 56 P. granosimanus was
brought up from the subtidal region, approximately 20
feet below mean sea level. Of this sample, 54 were
female and 48 were gravid. A sampling of these dis-
closed a very narrow range of size and egg number. This
size range does not overlap with the intertidal size
range and may imply that the smaller females occur in
a subtidal environment and then migrate to the intertidal
region as they grow larger.
The P. sanuelis have a size distribution very sim-
ilar to that of the intertidal P. granosimanus, ithough
it is shifted slightly towards smaller sizes. The num-
berof eggs carried is generally only a little greater
than half of the number carried by P. granosimanus. There
is also a group of very small individuals carrying fewer
than 50 eggs each. In between these two groups there is
a gap in the size range. This gap could possibly cor-
respond to u subtidal group analogous to the P. gran
imanus subtidal group.
The above results are summarized in Table II.
