pleopods, amounting to 0.0025 gram or less depending on
the size of the individual crab. A small number of these
eggs (approximately 50) were counted and then weighed.
These data yielded an average weight for a single egg
and the total number of eggs carried.
The total length of the carapace, from the median
tooth to the posterior notch, was chosen as the index
of size. This seemed more accurate than carapace width,

fes this distance lies in one plane.) The measurement was
taken using an ocular micrometer (accuracy + 0.1 millimeter).
The age of the eggs was determined by use of a table
reproduced in Coffin's article. (See Table I) By inter-
polation of this table, ages were determined to f l day.
Finally, egg size was measured using an ocular
micrometer (accuracy + 0.01 millimeter). Young eggs are
very nearly spherical in shape, but older eggs assume
the shape of an elongate spheroid. In this case the
longest dimension was measured.
Results
The number of eggs carried by a female is plotted
as a function of carapace length in Figure 1.
The gravid P. granosimanus specimens from the inter-
tidal region have a large range of egg numbers with a
moderate range in size. There is some evidence of the
larger crabs carrying larger numbers of eggs, but not
as much as might be expected. However, for a crab of
