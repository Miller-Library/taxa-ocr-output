Introduction
Information concerning the egg bearing potential
of an animal is often useful to know, but sometimes
difficult to obtain. Very little information is avail-
able for the hermit crabs of the west coast of the
United States. H. G. Coffin (1960) gives brief data
on Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1859), but none on
Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859). Also, no infor-
mation is available concerning egg development in these
two species. This paper endeavors to fill these
vacancies.
Methods and Procedures
The crabs used in these experiments were collected
randomly from the intertidal region of China Point in
Pacific Grove, California. The work was carried out
during the month of May, 1965.
The collected crabs were removed from their shells
by cracking the shells in a vise. The eggs were removed
from the female by cutting off the three pleopods holding
the egg mass. The eggs were dried on a paper tissue
for a brief time to remove excess water, and then
weighed on a Mettler balance (accuracy + O.1 milligram).
A small correction was made for the weight of the three
