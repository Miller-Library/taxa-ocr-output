METHODS AND MATERIALS
For the study on respiratory effects in sewage dilutions, two
experiments were conducted. The first experiment was carried out by
mixing primary unchlorinated sewage from the Monterey treatment plant
with sea waterâ€”the salinity was different in each of the separate dilutions
of sewage. The second experiment was the same, except salinity differences
were resolved by making the solutions isotonic with intertidal sea water.
This was accomplished by adding 3.35 gm of sea salts to every 100 ml
of sewage. Both experiments had the same array of M, californianus:
five individuals in each of six jars. Each jar contained 750 ml of fluid:
a control with 0% sewage, and jars with 0.5% sewage, 1% sewage, 2% sewage,
10% sewage and 50% sewage. Each jar had five Mytilus with approximately
corresponding lengths of 5 cm, 4 cm, 4-3 cm, 3 cm, and 2 cm, (Table 1).
The 30 individuals in the experiment with differing sewage concentrations
were collected at Hopkins Marine Station. The solutions in the jars
were changed daily, temperature was maintained at that of sea water,
the jars were kept in a room with dim lighting, and were aerated by
vigorously bubbling air through glass tubes at the top of the jars,
just below the water line.
Respiration tests were conducted by placing an individual in a
ground glass-stoppered bottle filled with a measured amount of fresh
sea water, and incubating the bottles in a small aquarium under the same
conditions of temperature (sea water) and light (dim) for 3 hours. At
the end of the incubation period, the amount of dissolved Oo left in
the sea water was determined according to the Winkler method as described
in Strickland and Parsons (1968). This value was then subtracted from
