the amount of Op initially present in the sea water. The amount initially
present was determined by incubating several known volumes of sea water
without Mytilus in the jars, and averaging the values. The amount of
02 left in the bottle was calculated according to the following equations:
360
ml 0/liter - Va - R.
st- R 2 50 2 V5-2
where Vg - volume of thiosulfate titrated (ml)
Rb = reagent blank (ml)
Vst" standardization titration (ml)
Vb - volume of bottle (ml)
In this equation, 50 ml aliquots are used for the
titration.
m1 02 - m1 0g/liter x V, (in liters)
Respiration is expressed in ml 0/hr/gm wet weight; the mussel was removed
from the valves and weighed without its byssus threads. The experiment
with variable sewage and salinity was conducted for a period of 4 weeks.
The experiment with only variable sewage concentrations lasted five days.
Due to deaths in the 50% sewage concentration, I prepared another
jar of five Mytilus (lengths of 5.1 cm, 4.0 cm, 3.6 cm, 3.0 cm, and
2.0 cn), of 506 sea water and 506 tap water to observe byssus thread
formation and deaths.
To characterize the amount of dissolved inorganic phosphates in
the jars, 100 ml aliquots were sampled and analyzed according to the
procedure of Murphy and Riley (1962), using the Klett electrophotometer.
To test deaths and byssus thread formation in an environment of
amines and amino acids present in sewage, the following extraction
procedure was used with 800 ml of primary unchlorinated sewage from
Monterey:
