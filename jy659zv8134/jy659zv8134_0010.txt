observed in the 50% dilution. The valves remained closed for the entire
four days, and there was no byssus thread formation by any of the animals.
No deaths were observed in 50% sewage over the course of the experiment.
To determine if amines and/or amino acids in the sewage were toxic,
two mussels were placed in a jar with 750 ml of sea water containing
amines and amino acids extracted from 750 ml of primary unchlorinated
sewage. The characterization titration with 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M HOI
did not detect the presence of any amines and detected only one amino
acid (pk approx. 6.1) in the 50 mi sample. (Figure 1). Two control animals
were placed in 750 ml of uncontaminated sea water. These animals were
observed for 11 days, and no acute toxicity was evident. Normal byssus
thread formation was present in all four animals from the first day onward.
Since the solutions in the two jars were not changed, byssus thread
formation became erratic towards the end of the 11 day observation
period, but irregularities occured in both the control and experimental
animals.
Respiration. The respiration of 30 mussels in jars of sewage and
salinity dilutions was measured from three to five times and the values
then averaged. The 30 averages representing the respiration of the 30
individuals were graphed as ml 0/hr/gm wet weight. (Table 3 and Figure
. In the 50% dilution of sewage and salinity, in which all the animals
eventually died, respiration was lower than the control values in four
out of the five test animals. It was approximately 30% lower for the
5 cm mussel, 274 lower for the 4 cm mussel, 20% lower for the 3 cm mussel,
and 35% lower for the 2 cm individual. In the 1% dilution of sewage and
salinity, respiration increased fromethe control value in four out of
