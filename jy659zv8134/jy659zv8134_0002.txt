ABSTRACT
California sea mussels (Mytilus californianus) of 2 to 5 cm length
were collected from intertidal areas in Pacific Grove, California, during
May. They were placed in various dilutions of primary unchlorinated
sewage and their respiration was measured. Results indicate that sewage
causes changes in respiratory activity, and that high concentrations are
extremely toxic. An attempt was made to isolate the toxic factors but
proved unsuccessful. Data for the excretion of dissolved inorganic
phosphate by the mussels are also presented.
