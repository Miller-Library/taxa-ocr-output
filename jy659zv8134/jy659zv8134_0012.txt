with primary sewage from Pacific Grove, (chlorinated and unchlorinated),
proved to be even more injurious to intertidal test animals than primary
unchlorinated effluent from Monterey. Thus it is possible that the
paucity of M, californianus on the rocks covered with Pollicipes
polymerous southeast of the Point Pinos outfall is due to sewage pollution
of that area. Although acute toxicity was demonstrated only at 50g
concentrations in my work, observations were made for only a two-week
period, and the sewage I used was not from Foint Pinos.
The data on the respiration of the California sea mussels in deleterious
environments are not conclusive; more tests should have been performed.
However, examination of the data in Tables 3 and 4 shows that in a large
number of cases, the figures for onygen consumption of each mussel were
gery similar. Moreover, when the data is graphed, (Figures 2 and 3),
it shows variation of respiratory activity with age. This concurs with
experiments on Nytilus perna by Bayne (1967), and adds credibility to
my work.
The respiration graphs show several interesting trends. In Figure
2 where the 50% dilution proved lethal, respiration of the moribund
mussels was substantially lower than the controls. Figure 3 (variable
sewage and constant salinity) shows the opposite trend for the mussels
in the 50% dilution; this indicates a different response to an environment
where salinity is not a factor. I believe that the mussels show respiration
values higher than control values because they were making up an oxygen
debt during incubation which was acquired while in the sewage. This
hypothesis is supported by several facts. Fox (1936) has shown that
chemotactic responses are demonstrated by M. californianus for certain
substances. The mussel remains with its valves shut tight in such hostile
