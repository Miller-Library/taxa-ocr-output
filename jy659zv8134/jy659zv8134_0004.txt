INTRODUCTION
The city of Pacific Grove, California (population approximately
15,000) disposes household wastes in the intertidal area of Point Pinos.
The outfall discharges wastes at an average rate of 1.6 million gallons
per day. The sewage undergoes primary treatment and is chlorinated
prior to discharge, but the detectable level of free chlorine in the
water decreases rapidly within a few feet of the outfall.
One of the irregularities in the intertidal community in the vicinity
of the outfall which is in contrast to adjacent intertidal areas is the
absence of the California sea mussel, Mytilus californianus (Conrad, 1837).
Fifty feet northwest of the outfall, large M. californianus beds begin
and continue up the side of the point. These locations are relatively
unpolluted since the areas are washed by heavy surf at high tide, exposed
to the air at low tide, are in waters which test low in excess nutrients
and chemical pollutants, and have surface currents which keep the sewage
out of the area. Southeast of these beds, in a direction toward the
outfall, the intertidal rocks are barren of all life. But rocks in close
approximation to the outfall and in a southernly direction down the point
are densely covered with clusters of the barnacle Pollicipes polymerous.
In uncontaminated intertidal areas, Pollicipes and Mytilus individuals
often grow in the same area, or in adjacent clusters. Close macroscopic
examination of the Pollicipes communities on the rocks in polluted areas
showed no more than three to five Mytilus individuals per 15-20 Pollicipes
clusters (each cluster with 20 - 30 individuals). None of the
californianus were larger than 3.5 cm in length. Further south
70.
