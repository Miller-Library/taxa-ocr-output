environments. In a series of experiments with M, californianus in
various concentrations of sea water, Fox (1936) noted that in water of
salinity below 14.94 %/00 the mussels either remained with valves closed,
or opened only after many hours and then reclosed permanently. Both of
these observations suggest that my mussels could detect a hostile sewage
environment and responded by isolating themselves from it. The hypothesis
is further supported by two observations I made in the lab. During the
respiration test incubation, I noticed that a few of the individuals
from the 50% sewage dilution had fixed themselves to the bottles with
byssus threads. This happened only occasionally with any of the mussels,
including the control animals. Perhaps the mussel detected a favorable
change in the environment and began functioning to make up for its
decreased activity in the sewage. Also, the turbidity of the 50% sewage
dilution decreased very little in the 24 hours it was in contact with
the experimental animals. This is in contrast to my observations on
the other sewage dilutions and the sewage:salinity dilutions. It is
also inconsistent with the fact that Mytilus is known to be very effective
in lowering the turbidity of murky waters in a matter of hours (Fox, 1936).
In summary, I believe that the mussels could not survive in the 50%
sewage dilution, and when placed in a healthy environment, they attempted
to make up an oxygen debt acquired during incubation.
The changes in respiration demonstrated at 1% sewage:salinity and
1% sewage dilutions indicate that the respiratory activity of M. californianus
is extremely sensitive to small changes in the environment. The meaning
of the changes in respiration at 10 dilutions is not clear; they may
be an indication of increased feeding activity due to a solution slightly
