richer in detritus than the control, or may be a reflection of osmotic
stress in a less than normal salinity.
The data on dissolved inorganic phosphate levels serve the practical
purpose of roughly characterizing the sewage from Monterey used in the
experiments. The results also suggest an hypothesis concerning phosphate
excretion in M, californianus. The values for the control animals, the
0.5%, 1%, and 24 sewage:salinity dilutions indicate that the mussels
increased the level of phosphate by about 20 Klett units in 24 hours-
approximately 0.07 ugm-at/1 (an increase of 0.053 ugm-at in these 750
ml jars). The mussels in the 10% dilution increased the environmental
level of phosphate by a measure of 10 Klett units,more, but this can
be accounted for by the fact that sewage under the same conditions but
without mussels increased in phosphate by 5-10 Klett units in the same
period.
