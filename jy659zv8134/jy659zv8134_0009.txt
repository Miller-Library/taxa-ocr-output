raise p√§ to 10 with Naon
extract three times with 240 ml aliquots of diethyl ether
extract the ether fraction three times with 240 ml aliquots
of O.1 M HCI
4) evaporate the aqueous fraction to dryness
dissolve the dry residue with 800 ml sea water
The solution was characterized by titrating a 50 ml sample with 0.1M
HOl and O.1 M NaoH, measuring pH as the dependent variable. The remaining
750 ml were put into a jar with two Mytilus (lengths of 4.4 om.and
2.9 cm) and a control jar was set up with 750 ml sea water and two Mytilus
(lengths of 4.5 cm and 3.0 cm). These animals were kept under the same
conditions as all the other experimental animals. Observations were
recorded concerning byssus thread formation and death.
RESULTS
Acute toxicity. In jars with sewage and salinity dilutions, acute
toxicity occured in the 50% dilution. (Table 2). After two days in
the 50% sewage:salinity environment, none of the mussels formed byssus
threads. By the tenth day one was dead, and by the thirteenth day, all
had died. From the sixth to thirteenth day, the mussels indicated a
moribund condition by showing sluggishness in closing their valves when
the mantle edge was prodded with forceps.
In the jar with 50%-sea water: 50% tap water, the mussels did not
form byssus threads for the first two days, but by the third day three
out of five were connected to the jar. By the twelfth day, the mussels
byssus thread formation was normal. They continued to function normally
for the remaining eight days of the experiment.
In the jars with various sewage concentrations, acute toxicity was
