down the point the population of M. californianus increased with occasional
small clusters of 7-10 animals. Thus there seemed to be a gradient of
density of M. californianus on the coastline southeast of the outfall,
absence of any individuals at the outfall, and a large proliferation
northwest of the pipe in relatively uncontaminated waters.
The feeding habits of M. californianus suggest its susceptibility
to any effects of sewage pollution. Fox (1936) stresses the great
importance of finely divided organic debris or detritus that constitutes
a large part of the material ingested by mussels and other lammellibranchs.
He states that M, californianus normally feeds almost exclusively on
detritus and the smaller planktonic organisms, and although mollusks
have organs specialized for dealing only with small particles, selection
of food is entirely nonqualitative. Anything which is not too large
or spiny is ingested, although it may not be digested. Later, Fox (194-
again notes that although M. californianus eats dinoflagellates, diatoms
and bacteria, the largest fraction of its nutrituve material is detritus.
It is assumed that organic material is ingested in a finely divided or
partly colloidal state-not as dissoived organic matter. Thus
M. californianus is a scavenger, which feeds largely on the types of
materials which are likely to be found in sewage. If sewage has an effect
on intertidal animals, it is likely that M. californianus is extremely
susceptible.
Tests were made on the acute toxicity and on the less severe metabolic
stresses of primary unchlorinated sewage on M. californianus. Acute
toxicity is scored by the death of an individual, or by the severe
incapacitation of an individual's normal activity of byssus thread formation.
