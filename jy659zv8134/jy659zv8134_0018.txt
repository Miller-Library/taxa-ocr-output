TABLE LEGENDS
Table 1. Measurements of length and weight of each of the 60 mussels
used in the respiration experiments. Note that there are 5 in
each dilution of sewage:salinity, and 5 in each dilution of sewage.
Table 2. Data on acute toxicity-byssus thread formation and death
used as criteria. Empty squares indicate normal functioning, X's indicate
absence of byssus threads in all five animals, and blacked-out squares
indicate that all five are dead. 2b, 3b,4b, indicate the number of
mussels with byssus threads (short of all 5), and 10, 30 show the
number dead (short of all 5).
Table 3. Raw data from the sewage:salinity experiment, expressed in
ml 02/3 hrs, used to graph the respiration curves. in Figure 2.
Table 4. Raw data from the sewage experiment, expressed in mi 0,/3 hrs
used to graph the respiration curves in Figure 3.
Table 5. Phosphate readings measured in Klett units. Measurements
were taken in the 50% salinity jar, the jars of sewage: salinity
dilutions, and a jar of 10% sewage: salinity with no mussels in it.
