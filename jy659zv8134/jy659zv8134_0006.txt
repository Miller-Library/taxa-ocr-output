To determine less severe stresses on metabolic activity, changes in
respiration of individuals in various concentrations of sewage were measured.
Acute toxicity was demonstrated with extremely high amounts of sewage,
and respiration seems to be affected at lesser concentrations. However,
conclusions from respiratory rate data are not well substantiated.
In addition to these studies on the toxicity of sewage, two less
intensive studies were conducted: 1) changes in the level of dissolved
inorganic phosphates in the environment of the experimental animals, and
2) a preliminary investigation into the effects of the amines and amino
acids in sewage on M. californianus. The level of dissolved inorganic
phosphates in the sewage was used as a characterization of the amount
of pollutants present. The level of phosphates in the solutions was
higher after 24 hour contact with the mussels. Concerning the amines
and amino acids, Fox (1936) states that a turbid sea water suspension
of marine bacterial organisms, maintained by the addition of Witte's
peptone, proved injurious to mussels: valves were kept tightly closed
or death occurred if left immersed too long. He believes that the
nitrogenous bacterial metabolites which are characteristic of decomposing
protein matter caused the deleterious effects on the mussels. Fox cites
Harvey (1925) as showing that with the copepod Calanus, bacterial growth
supported by peptone is far more toxic than when supported by sugar.
I extracted the amines and amino acids from a dilution of sewage twice
as great as shown to be damaging, and subjected experimental animals to
them. There was no acute toxicity demonstrated-no deaths nor absence
of byssus thread formation.
