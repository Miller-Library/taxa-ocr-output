five test animals. It increased approximately 294 for the 4 cm mussel,
23% for the 3-3.5 cm mussel, 10% for the 3 cm mussel (up to 17% in the
2% dilution), and 18% for the 2 cm individual.
The respiration of the 30 mussels in the jars of sewage dilutions
with sea water salinity was measured two to three times and the values
averaged (Table 4 and Figure 3). In the 50% dilution of sewage, respiration
was higher than the control values in four of the five individuals. It
was approximately 17 higher for the 5 cm mussel, 48% higher for the
3.5-4 cm mussel, 32% for the 3 cm mussel, and 28% for the 2 cm mussel.
In the 0.5% dilution of sewage, four of the five individuals respired
less than control, but the decrease is not very large for the 5 cm and
4 cm mussels.
Phosphate levels. The changes in the phosphate levels in the six
jars of the sewage:salinity dilutions, the 50% tap water:50% sea water
jar, and a jar of 10% sewage without mussels were measured over a 24
hour period. (Table 5). The amount of dissolved inorganic phosphate
increased in all the jars except in the 50% tap water: 50% sea water.
The increases in the control, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% dilutions are roughly
equivalent; the 10% dilution increase is larger. No readings were made
on the 50% dilution. The level of phosphates also rose in a jar of 10%
sewage without any test animals in the solution.
DISCUSSION
The experiments on acute toxicity indicate that primary unchlorinated
sewage is toxic to Mytilus californianus if present at high levels in
the environment. In other toxicity studies conducted by my colleagues
