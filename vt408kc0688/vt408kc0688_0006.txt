days, these areas were observed at the 4 extremes of the
tidal cycle. The number of tentacles and the movement of
the tagged individuals were recorded. Each station was
observed for an additional two days only at high tide. On
the 8th day, a 2 ft. diameter hole was excavated at each of
these "origins" to determine the number remaining.
The experiment was repeated using worms dyed in Bismark
brown. The tagged worms were observed during the extremes
of the tidal cycle for two days and during high tide for
two additional days. The test was again repeated using
Toluylene blue to dye the tentacles. The animals were observed
at high tide for 6 consecutive days. Afterwards, the sand in
a two foot diameter circle around the origin was sifted and
the number of dyed individuals recorded.
It is extremely difficult to determine the number of
tagged individuals present near the surface. Each Cirriformia
extends an estimated 5 to 10 tentacles above the substrate.
When a population was scasparse, it was assumed that all
tentacles projecting from the same point belonged to a single
worm. Based on the assumption that each worm put 7 tentacles
above the surface, a visual estimate was made of the worms
present in a dense population.
Tentacles on the surface do not necessarily indicate the
density of the population present under the surface of the
sand. Consequently, cores were taken at stations B, C,
and D during the four extremes of the tidal cycle to determine
whether there was a constant ratio of tentacles on the
r
surface to the worm population density underneath. Tentacle
