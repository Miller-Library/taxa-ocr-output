from the lip 3 in. outward to cover the surrounding sand.
The box was filled with sifted sand taken from the area.
The sand in the container was examined 4 times during a
12-day period.
To test the range of vertical movement, a 4x20 in.
polyethylene cylinder, filled with sifted sand and capped
on the top, was buried during a very low tide. The cylinder
was removed at high tide and the contents examined for the
presence of the polychaetes. This experiment was repeated
times over a 12-day period.
Preliminary studies indicated that tentacles of some
individuals were present on the substrate surface throughout
the tidal cycle except when the sand surface was above the
water level and dry. Movement patterns of the population
were charted by placing dyed animals in given areas and
observing their dyed tentacles on the surface of the substrate.
Neutral red, Bismark brown, and Toluylene blue were found to
be the most effective dyes after tests in which the organisms
were submerged for 2 hrs. in a solution containing 1 liter
of sea water to 2 gms. of dye.
500 worms were placed at various stations in the field
area. The number of worms was measured volumetrically since
excessive handling was found to be fatal. Approximately 500
worms can occupy a volume of 300 ml., hence 300 ml. containers
filled with dyed animals were estimated as containing 500
animals.
Four stations were chosen on the basis of their
variability in three pertinent conditions: density of the
