MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field experiments were conducted in the yacht harbor
area of Monterey, California, during the spring of 1968.
The directional movement of adult C. spirabrancha in a
population at about the 0.0 ft. tidal level was investigated
in the following three experiments.
To test for horizontal and diagonal movement two
1xlx0.33 ft. wood-framed containers, screened on the top
and open at the bottom, and two O.5x0.5x0.33 ft. wood-framed
boxes were used (figure 1). A one cubic-foot hole was dug
during a very low tide. The large box was placed in the hole
with its screen facing downward. One of the smaller boxes
was placed at its center. Sand extracted from the hole was
sifted into the opening to remove any adult Cirriformia
which might have been present. When the sifted sand was level
with the surface, a smaller box was placed at the center and
forced into the sifted sand. The remaining large frame, screen
facing upward, was forced down until the screen touched the
sand. Screens allowing for the passage of water were
specifically placed to prohibit the worms from entering from
above or below, yet still allowing them to enter from the
sides. The substrate between the two smaller boxes was examined
every third day for a total period of twelve days.
To test possible movement through the surf, a 0.125
cubic-foot container with wooden sides, screened bottom, and
open top, was buried during a very low tide, its top flush
with the substrate surface (figure 2). To prevent worms from
entering over the lip, a flanged screen collar was extended
