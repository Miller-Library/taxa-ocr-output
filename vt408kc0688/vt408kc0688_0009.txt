slow, after sig days a few individuals had moved as far as
five feet, but an average of eighty percent of the worms
were still clustered about the "origin" (figures 3 and 4).
Unfortunately, the staining process seems to have had
lethal effects on the organisms. When the "origins" were
excavated at the termination of an experiment, no more than
half of the worms originally planted could be accounted for
and decaying Cirriformia pieces were observed on two occasions.
During other experiments, several stained worms were seen
protruding from the substrate with decomposing skin. Yet
many stained worms lived for over one month with no apparent
side effects.
The unexplained disappearance of Cirriformia which
initially led to this study could perhaps be accounted for
by the aggregation tendencies of the worm. Concurrent
experiments (Smith, 1968) indicate that the worms often
are found in densities greater than 750/100 cm in 1 to 15
foot diameter clumps, 1 to 5 feet apart. Practically no worms
were found between such clumps. The initial coring may by
chance have included only unpopulated areas during low tide
and only aggregated areas during high tide.
Results of these experiments, then, indicate little
movement of adult Cirriformia. The movement that does occur
appears to be small and random. These results suggest that
populations of adult C. spirabrancha are relatively stable
and tend not to move once established.
