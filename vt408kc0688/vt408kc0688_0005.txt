existing population, sand particle size, and tidal level.
Station A was at a depth of -2.5 ft. The substrate
was very fine, with 7%% of the sand having a diameter of
less than 0.124 mm. (as determined by dry weight). The
interphase between aerobic and anaerobic substrates (white
vs. black sand) was 4 cm. below the surface. The population
density was found to be 3,200 worms/m as determined by
random cores.
Station B was situated at 10.7 ft. The sand here also
was fine, with 76% of it having a diameter less than
0.124 mm. The interphase was 5 cm. deep. The worm population
density was 2,700/m. Periodically, mild turbulence resulted
from tidal changes.
Station C was situated at 40.3 ft. The sand size
was much coarser here with 19% of the sand larger than
1.397 mm. in diameter and 45% smaller than 0.124 mm. in
diameter. The area was surrounded by large boulders, which
might possibly hinder horizontal movement of the worms.
The population density was 750 worms/m.
Station D was situated at +0.1 ft. It was centered
on a broad, sandy plain, where tidal changes created much
turbulence. The particle size of the sand was coarse, with
24% larger than 1.397 mm. in diameter and only 29% smaller
than O.124 mm. in diameter. Population density was 1,900
worms/m?.
Neutral red-dyed worms were placed 3 in. deep in a
in. diameter hole (the "origin") att each of the stations. For five
