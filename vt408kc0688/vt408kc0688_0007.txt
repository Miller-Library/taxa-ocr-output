numbers were recorded in a 4 in. diameter circle and a 10
in, deep core was taken. Since the density of tentacles on
the surface is variable, efforts were made to include both
"heavily" and "lightly" populated areas as estimated by the
number of tentacles apparent on the surface.
Meanwhile, an attempt was made to determine whether the
same relationships occurred in samples taken during a night-
day cycle. Four containers 1 ft. and 5 in. deep were placed
in an outdoor tank. The containers were filled with sifted
substrate and with 30, 150, 250, and 500 worms respectively.
Water height was kept at a constant level of 1 ft. above the
sand surface. The ratio of tentacles to the total population
was recorded day and night for 4 days.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Cirriformia appear to move diagonally and possibly
horizontally. The submerged cylinder testing the possibility
that animals migrate vertically below twenty in. failed to
detect migration from these depths (table 1). If any worms
had descended below twenty inches during low tide, they should
have returned again toethe surface at high tide when tentacles
of Cirriformia reappeared in the adjacent area. Observations
that neither Cirriformia nor their mucus tubes were present
below eight in. (Smith, 1968) likewise confirmed this.
Movement through the surf cannot be an important means
of transportation; not even an occasional worm appeared in the
container which allowed only surface moving organisms to
enter, except that in one instance two worms were found in
