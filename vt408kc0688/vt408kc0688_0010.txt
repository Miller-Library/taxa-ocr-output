SUMMAR
Movement of Cirriformia is random and not extensive.
2. Cirriformia appear to move diagonally, and possibly
horizontally
3. The number of tentacles observed on the surface of the
substrate in a given population seems to represent only
35 -55% of the total population during night and day, and
during all phases of the tidal cycle except in dry sand during
an extremely low tide when their tentacles are retracted.
4. Evidence indicates Cirriformia remain in the upper 8 inches
of the substrate.
