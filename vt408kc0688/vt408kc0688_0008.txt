the apparatus. Heavy surf, however, had buried the container
under three in. of sand, possibly allowing entrance through
the substrate (table 1).
The container allowing horizontal and diagonal migration
did contain many worms after three days. If the worms entered
horizontally from the surrounding substrate, they should have
dispersed randomly throughout the container. In fact,
Notomastus, an errant polychaete commonly found in the same
substrate as Cirriformia, was evenly dispersed throughout
the container. If movement were diagonal, however, worms
could reach the center box only by a zig-zag pattern of
burrowing-- moving upward diagonally, retreating along a
different path, and then coming up again in a different
direction. Few worms would therefore be expected in that
case to reach the inner box. Indeed, a disproportionate
number of Cirriformia were found in the area between the
small boxes. Only an average of ten percent of the worms in
the entire container were in the middle section which occupied
thirty percent of the total volume.
Tentacle counts indicated that at all times only
approximately forty-five percent of the animals had their
tentacles showing above the surface of the sand, except when
the sand was uncovered by water, in which case all the
tentacles were retracted (table 2).
There was no regular migratory pattern noticedlduring
experiments in which the movement of dyed worms were observed.
The dyed worms were dispersed equally in all directions from
the four "origins" (table 2). The rate of movement was
