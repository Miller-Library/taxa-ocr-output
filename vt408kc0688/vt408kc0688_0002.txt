Cirriformia spirabranche (Woore, 1904) is very common
along the California coast, inhabiting mainly sheltered
intertidal regions, although at times it extends to depths
in excess of 7 meters. During the spring of 1968, preliminary
examinations were made on various populations of intertidal
C. spirabrancha in the yacht harbor area of Monterey,
California. During these observations core samples taken
at the 0.0 ft. tidal level at both low and high tide showed
the presence of large numbers of animals when the sand was
wet, and an apparent complete absence of animals in the
same region at extreme low tide. This suggested possible
vertical or even horizontal movement during various stages
of the tidal cycle.
While work haskbeen carried routdonusome aspectspect
of the biology of cirratulids by George (1964), Flatterley
(1916), and Courtney (1958), there have been no investigations
concerning the movement of the adult animals. Because of
this general lack of knowledge concerning the movement of
adult polychaetes and because initial field observations
on C. spirabrancha suggested rather extensive movements of
the adults of this species, an investigation was initiated
to determine the presence, magnitude and characteristics
of movement of the adults of C. spirabrancha
