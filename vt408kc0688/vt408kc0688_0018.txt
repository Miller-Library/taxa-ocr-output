igure 1. Apparatus testing diagonal and horizontal movement
of Cirriformia through the substrate.
Figure 2. Apparatus testing possible movement of Cirriformia
through the surf.
Figure 3. Distance and number of dyed tentacles observed away
from the origins 6 days after the third experiment. The
organisms within one foot were not included since the majority
were in an aggregation within that Ã¥reasneEach number"on the
abscissa represents the distance from the "origin." The points
on the graph represent the total number of dyed animals
observed between the corresponding distance from the "origin"
and the next recorded distance.
Figure 4. Total number of dyed worms at and near the "origins,"
seen during a series of high tides for 6 consecutive days after
implantation. The results are indicative of those obtained in
two additional experiments.
