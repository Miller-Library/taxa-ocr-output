greatly fluctuating environment. This paper investigates clumping in
Tigriopus and its possible adaptive significance in light of the animal's
habitat.
FIELD STUDIES
Field work was done on splash pools from 8 to 13 feet above mean low
tide at China Point, California. Pcols referred to as dessicated contained
no standing water with little or no moisture detectable in the bottom
sediment. Pools of extreme high salinity ranged from 120 o/oo to damp
salt crystals.
Tigriopus were found in 9 of 12 dessicated pools examined. 7 of these
9 pools had a substratum of sediment and loose rocks, the other 2 containing
only sediment. Clumps of Tigriopus were found on the underside of many of
the rocks with greater concentrations of clumps under rocks imbedded 1 to
2 cm. into the bottom sediment than those resting on dry sediment or
other rocks. A lower density of isolated Tigriopus was observed in the
bottom sediment of the pools containing rocks. No clumps were found in the
sediment of any pool. Several dry rocks with clumps were placed in fresh
sea water in the lab. After a period of several hours Tigriopus were
observed swimming in the container. Baxter (1977), reports similar findings
in which live adult Tigriopus did not appear until after a pericd of 3 weeks.
In tide pools above 120 o/o0
igriopus were found clumped in dark cracks
both above and below the waterline as well as under rocks at the bottom of
the pool. In a pool of 148 o/oo no animals were seen in the water column
or on the bottom, while an area of approximately 8 cme directly below
the waterline and in a constantly shaded crack was covered with a solid
mass of clumped Tigricpus. The animals in this massive clump appeared
in a near comatose state as dislodging animals produced very slow movement
