side furthest from the more intense window lighting. In the dishes lacking
substrates approximately 108 of the Tigriopus formed clusters of 3-5
animals clinging to one another. An average of 708 of the animals in the
no-substrate dishes were in the half of the dish away from the windows.
After one day of complete dessication, distilled water was added to all
12 dishes to return the salinity to normal. There was near 1008 mortality
at the end of the recovery period.
SURVIVAL T
1. High Salinity Stress. Tigriopus were placed into water of 140 c/0o
salinity for a 15 hour exposure period. The following groups of animals
were used: 1) clumps - animals in agitation clumps described earlier;
2) disrupted clumps - animals disrupted from agitation clumps by forceÂ¬
ful squirting with a pipette. This technique produced no mortality;
3) non-clumped - animals taken in a random sample from the same population
as the above groups.
When placed into the high salinity water, the non-clumped and
disrupted-clump animals greatly increased their activity for 1 to 2 minutes
before becoming torpid. Survival results are summarized in Table 2.
The sexual composition of the clumped and disrupted-clump animals compared
to that of the non-clumped is shown in Table 3. Larvae and copulating
pairs are omitted due to their occurrence in very low frequencies.
2. Cold Shock. Three separate experiments were run to test the differential
survival of clumped and disrupted-clump animals subjected to sudden exposure
to cold. The disrupted-clump animals were observed to remain active for less
than 30 seconds in trials 1 and 2 and for less than 2 minutes in trials
3 and 4. In all cases a 15 hour recovery period was allowed at room
temperature before assays were made. Conditions and results of each
trial are listed in Table 4.
