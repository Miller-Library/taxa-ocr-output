osmotic concentration of the body fluid than do torpid animals at 120 o/00.
The apparent disparity between survival values and osmotic concentrations
suggests that the clumped state may differ from simple torpor. It may
be that there are physiological changes other than those of torpor
associated with clump formation. This is suggested by the results of the
salinity shock experiments. Clumped animals had a small but significantly
greater survival value than did animals that had been in a clump briefly
with both groups being much more resistant than non-clumped animals. If
these physiological changes are not instantaneous, than these results
might be expected.
More work on the time of formation of disrupted clumps and its effect
on survival as well as the osmoregulation and the oxygen consumption of
clumps is highly suggested.
The most curious results of this study are those of the increased
rasistance to cold shock of clumped Tigriopus. Being an ectotherm, there
is no possibility of increased heat retention by a clump. Increased
membrane permeability is known to be a phenomenon associated with low
temperatures, (Prosser, 1973). It is conceivable that the decreased
surface area of a clumped Tigriopus could lower the detrimental ion
flow between the animal and its environment. Determination of the
ionic constitution of clumped and solitary Tigriopus is suggested.
SUMMARY
Tigriopus californicus is seen to form clumps in the field and in
the lab under conditions of high salinity and dessication. There is an
indication that clumps may form in response to wave shock as well. Clump
formation serves to increase the resistance of Tigriopus to high salinity
and low temperature shock. A definite negative phototactic response is
associated with clump formation and an increased thigmotaxis is suggested.
