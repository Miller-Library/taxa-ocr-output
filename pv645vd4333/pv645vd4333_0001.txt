INTRODUCTION
Species throughout the animal kingdom actively aggregate into tight
clusters under certain conditions. This phencmenon, which I will refer
to as clumping, was studied by Allee (1931) in the early part of this
century in the water isopod Asellus communis, several species of land
isopods, and the brittle star Ophioderma brevispina; all species not
generally considered to be social. Natural aggregations of these animals
were seen to be primarily the result of the reaction of individuals to
the environment. Clumping behavior occurred most frequently under adverse
conditions and when the normally positive thigmotactic response was not
possible. In the laboratory, increased survival of clumps over individuals
was demonstrated in some situations. Despite the appeal of this early work.
in recent years little has been done in the area of animal aggregations,
Tigriopus californicus, a harpacticoid copepod inhabiting splash pools
of the intertidal zone from Baja California to Alaska, has been observed
to form clumps in the field as well as in the laboratory under conditions
of environmental stress. This is of particular interest in this species
which, except for periods of copulation, has shown no interaction between
members under normal conditions. To date, no investigation of clumping
behavior in Tigiopus or any other marine copepod has been made. Patterson
(1968), mentioned that Tigriopus forms clumps at high salinities under
laboratory conditions and is sometimes found to "swarm" in the field.
Burnett (1977), states that Tigriopus can form clumps in low temperatures
in the field.
The environment of the high splash pool is one of extremes of temperature
and salinity. Studies have suggested that Tigriopus is well suited to this
