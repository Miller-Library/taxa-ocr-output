clumps would not form, suggesting that there is a different response to
the postulated attractant under stress.
COMPOSITTON OF CLUMPS
It can be seen in Table 3 that females with eggs comprise a higher
percentage of the population in agitation clumps than in the sampling
population. Their survival strengths were not found to be statistically
different from those of all adult Tigriopus. Further work on the sensi-
tivity of females with eggs to stress may offer an explanation for these
results.
ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE
The benefits accrued members of a clump are threefold and appear to
arise from changes in the physical and physiological state of the animal.
Most readily explained is the increased resistance to wave shock. LabÂ¬
oratory evidence indicates that when subjected to equal water velocities,
animals in a clump are less prone to being dislodged from the substrate
than are individual Tigriopus. Combined with the occurrence of clumps
primarily in protected regions of the tidepool it follows that when a
dessicated or high salinity pool is inundated by wave splash, animals
in a clump are less likely to be washed out.
Increased resistance to high salinities is of obvious adaptive im-
portance. A mechanism suggested by the closely packed crientation of
the animals in a clump is one in which a decrease in body surface area
exposed to high salinity produces a corresponding decrease in the total
osmotic gradient impinging on the animal. Thus, a member of a clump would
be able to tolerate salinities beyond the normal osmoregulatory capacity
of an individual. Osmoregulation studies on Tigriopus indicate that this
mechanism is probably not the case. Tigriopus in a clump have a higher
