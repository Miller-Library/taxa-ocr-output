back to the clump or drifting to the bottom. Forty days later at a time
when the salinity was in excess of 220 o/oo, no animals were found in the
above location. However, behind a flat rock pryed loose from the wall of
the pool 2 cm. above the waterline were found hundreds of clumped Tigriopus.
LAB STUDIES
GENERAL METHODS
Tigriopus used in this study were collected from splash pools of
salinities from 35 to 45 o/oo at Asilomar Beach State Park and China Point.
During collection water containing the animals was strained through a fine
nylon mesh so only adult and late copepodid stages were retained. Plastic
containers of approximately 20 liters of sea water at 35-45 o/0o were used
to maintain populations in the lab. Every three days the water was
changed and the animals were fed Tetramin fish food.
Instant Ocean (trade name) dissolved in distilled water was used
where initial salinities greater than normal sea water was required.
Salinity was measured with a Goldberg refractometer. All experiments were
run at room temperature with constant room lighting unless otherwise
indicated.
Recovery from stress was in room temperature sea water for 24 hours.
Water was changed in salinity stress experiments by slowly drawing off the
"old" water through plankton netting, followed by slow addition of recovery
water with a mimimum of turbulence. Death was defined as an absence of reÂ¬
sponse to prodding at the end of the recovery period. A copulating pair
was scored as dead if both members failed to respond.
Four working classifications of animals were defined: 1) females
with eggs - egg sack visible; 2) larvae - all solitary immature animals;
3) copulating pair - adult male grasping a larvae in the copulatory position;
4) adults - all other solitary adults.
