CLUMP FORMATION
1. Dessication Clumps. Approximately 100 animals in one ml. of normal
sea water were placed in the center of a 5.5 cm. Whatman's No. 1 filter
paper. As the water was absorbed clumps formed. The location of these
clumps relative to a directional light source of 8000-10,000 lux was
noted. Animals were run in the dark and a control using dead animals was
run to check for passive aggregation of animals due to cohesive forces of
water.
Results are shown in Table 1. 14 out of 14 of these "dessication
clumps" formed in the light were on the half of the filter paper furthest
from the most intense light source. The animals could be seen to move
in this direction before forming clumps. In the dark,clumps were randomly
distributed on the filter paper. The control with dead animals showed no
clump formation
2. Agitation Clumps. Strips of standard paper towel 8 cm.x 2 cm. were
placed along the sides of a l liter beaker of seawater containing approx¬
imately 5 animals per ml. When the water was agitated by stirring, clumps
formed on the paper towel. Clumps formed exclusively on the side of the
beaker furthest from the more intense window lighting. These agitation
clumps of from 10 to 40 animals were used in subsequent survival tests.
If periodic agitation (every 10 min.) was maintained, these clumps re¬
mained intact. Squirting with water from a pipette removed the individuals
from the toweling, leaving only clumps. From this procedure clumps were
determined to be more firmly attached to the substrate than individuals in
all of dozens of trials.
3. Slow Evaporation Clumps. 12 petri dishes containing 100 Tigriopus each
in 40 o/oo S.W. were allowed to evaporate to dryness over a 4 day period.
A single clump formed in 5 of the 6 dishes having paper towal substrates
with 2 clumps forming in one dish. All 7 of these clumps formed at the
