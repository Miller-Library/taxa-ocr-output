3. Gradual Cooling. 12 beakers of normal sea water containing Tigriopus
were cooled from 22°C to 0°C in 8 hours. All beakers had substrates.
In all cases no clumps formed. Test was conducted in total darkness.
OSMOREGULATION STUDIES
The osmotic concentration of clumped Tigriopus in 85 o/00 and 120 0/00
water and that of individual animals acclimated in these same ambient
salinities was determined with the help of Merchant (1977), who details
the method. Clumps in 85 o/oo were formed and maintained by gentle agitation,
Clumps in 120 o/oo were formed by an increase in salinity from 40 o/oo to
120 o/oo over a 4 hour period. Body fluid osmotic concentrations are given
in Table 5.
OXYGEN CONSUMPTION
Oxygen consumption rates were determined in conjunction with Senko
(1977), for 3 groups of Tigriopus: 1) individuals in 34 o/00; 2) agitation
clumps in 34 o/oo; 3) individuals in 90 o/00. Senko notes that in 90 o/oo
nearly 100 of the animals were in tightly clustered masses. This was not
seen for individuals in 34 o/00. Results are summarized in Table 6.
DISCUSSION
CLUMP FORMATION
It appears from the results of this study that clumping is the net
effect of a combination of responses induced by environmental stress. The
primary reactions of Tigriopus to stress are postulated to be:
1. positive thigmotropism
negative phottaxis
3. increased attraction to other Tigriopus
In all conditions of stress examined, Tigriopus are seen to leave
the water column if possible. In the lab, formation of agitation clumps
involves rapid movement toward the substrate with subsequent clinging.
