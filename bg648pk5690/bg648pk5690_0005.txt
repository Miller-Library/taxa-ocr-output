Oxygen affects on anemone movement
of their body, 2 if more than 50%, 3 if greater than 25%,
4 if not touching but less than 1 cm. from nearest neighbor,
and 5 if greater than 1 cm. from nearest neighbor. The
12 scores from each clone were then summed to quantify
the amount of spacing within each clone.
Results are shown in table II. Aposymbiotic anemones
space themselves significantly further apart than did
symbiotic clones (pe.02, T test for paired comparisons).

Clonal Distribution: Lab Experiments
Twelve speceimens of symbiotic Anthopleura elegantissima
were collected from each of 4 separate clones. Four test
aquaria were set-up as follows: the first was in the dark
with fresh running sea water; the second was uniformly
illuminated at 250 foot-candles and had running sea water;
the third and fourth tanks were kept in the dark, one with
flowing nitrogenated sea water (4.5 ml.00/1.) and the
other had oxygenated sea water (18.6 ml. 00/1.). To insure
tight clonal settling an inverted 250 ml. beaker was used
to inclose each group as it settled under uniform light
and normal flowing sea water. The settled anemones were
subject to the conditions described above, the beaker was
then removed, and the animals were allowed to move. After
24 hours of exposure the animals were scored using the
system used in the field studies. The 4 clones were run
