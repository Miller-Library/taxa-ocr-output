LEGENDS FOR FIGURES AND TABLES
Figure 1. Apparutus used in phototaxis experiments.
(a) Horizontal view of aquarium; (b) vertical view.
Figure 2. Phototaxis experiment with spots of light
on opposite sides of anemone, shown at onset (a); and conÂ¬
clusion (b).
Figure 3. Oxygen-taxis apparatus: (a) horizontal view
showing adjustable drains; (b) vertical view, tank sealed
in half by anemone. Oxygen-poor sea water was run into one
side, oxygen-rich into the other.
Table I. Results from phototaxis experiments: (a) with
normal sea water, symbiotic anemones show positive phototaxis;
(b) with oxygen content in the sea water varied, only symbiotic
anemones under low oxygen show positive phototaxis.
Table II. Results taken in field showing greater spacing
of aposymbiotic clones compared to symbiotic. Listings are
sums from scoring of 12 individuals from each clone; high
score indicates a higher degree of spacing.
