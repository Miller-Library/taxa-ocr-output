Oxygen affects on anemone movement
INTRODUCTION
Anemones within the species Anthopleura elegantissima
(Brandt, 1835) which contain zooxanthellae move from a
shaded area, where the photosynthetic rate of their endo-
symbionts would be reduced, towards a brightly lighted
area. Yet, aposymbiotic individuals distribute themselves
at random when similarly exposed (Buchsbaum 1968).
Pearse (1974) suggested that a chemical either consumed
or produced during photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae may
regulate this behavior. Such photosynthetic products are
liberated to the host anemone (Trench 1971). One chemical
so liberated is oxygen. Paramecium bursaria with zoochlorellae
show positive phototactic responses only under semi-anerobic
conditions (Jennings 1915). Oxygen apparently influences
the phototactic response of Paramecium bursaria and may
affect the movement of Anthopleura elegantissima as well..
I herein report on findings implicating oxygen as the
sole factor regulating the described phototactic response
and as a factor affecting interclonal distribution in
Anthopleura elegantissima.

xanthellae) Anthopleura elegantissima were collected from
