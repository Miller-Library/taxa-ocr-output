Oxygen affects on anemone movement
Aeration of oxygen and nitrogen through sea water
displaces roughly equal amounts of carbon dioxide, thus the
behavior noted cannot likely be attributable to a response
to a carbon dioxide gradient.
Since zoochlorellae release oxygen to their hosts and
very little photosynthetically-fixed carbon compared to
zooxanthellae (Muscatine 1971), demonstration of positive
phototaxis in Anthopleura elegantissima containing only
zoochlorellae would add consideribly to evidence indicating
oxygen as the sole factor influencing phototaxis.
By varying oxygen availability or zooxanthellae
activity, spacing within a clone can be alterred. Under
oxygen stress, clonal anemones move away from water further
depleted of oxygen by adjacent animals. This increased
spacing results in increased oxygen availability. In addition,
free standing individuals have a greater surface area
exposed to the water than do animals in contact with adjacent
clone-mates. In the field it is observed that aposymbiotic
anemones space themselves further apart than do symbiotic
anemones. Aposymbiotic clones likely need this increased
surface area and the more oxygenated water to obtain
oxygen which symbiotic anemones obtain from their endo-
symbionts. Increased spacing is also needed by symbiotic
clones living in areas lower in oxygen content than normal.
Therefore, oxygen appears to be a limiting factor affecting
