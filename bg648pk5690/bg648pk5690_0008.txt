SUMMARY
Anthopleura elegantissima was tested for phototaxis and
possible photosynthetic products (oxygen) responsible for
such behavior. Anemones, symbiotic with zooxanthellae, show
phototactic responses. Phototaxis can be disrupted by
exposing anemones to oxygen contents higher than ambient.
Directional movement is induced by exposing opposite sides
of an anemone to different oxygen concentrations; the
anemone moves towards the side of higher oxygen content.
Therefore oxygen, as a photosynthetic product of zooxanthellae,
is a controlling factor in phototaxis.
Aposymbiotic clones of Anthopleura elegantissima show
significantly more spacing between individuals than symbiotic
clones. Symbiotic clones under oxygen stress show spacing
similar to aposymbiotic clones. There is a direct relationÂ¬
ship between distribution of clonal individuals of Antho-
pleura elegantissima and oxygen availability, either from
the environment or from endosymbionts.
