Oxygen affects on anemone movement
a single intertidal clone (to eliminate genetic differences)
located off Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, Calif.
In addition, 12 individuals from each of 4 separate clones
were collected for clonal spacing studies.
METHODS AND RESULTS
Behavioral Standards: Phototaxis
The anemones were tested for phototaxis using the
apparatus shown in figure 1. Illumination was supplied
by a single 100 watt light bulb suspended 25 cm. above
the top of the aquarium. A rectangular piece of cardboard
was used to produce a well defined shadow covering half
of the aquarium. The light intensity on the lighted half
of the tank was 250 foot-candles, on the dark side it was
5 foot-candles. Fresh sea water at 13°0-100 ran continuous¬
ly through the tank parallel to the shadow line. Before
each experiment anemones were placed along the intended
shadow line of the aquarium and allowed to settle in
uniform light for 6-12 hours. The positions of the anemones
were recorded at the outset and again after 24 hours of
exposure. All experiments were run in groups of 7 animals

each.
The results of tests run with both symbiotic and apo-
symbiotic anemones are shown in table Ia. The difference in
response between the two types of anemones is significant
