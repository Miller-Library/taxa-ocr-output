Oxygen affects on anemone movement
(pe.05, Fishers exact test for independence), with only
symbiotic anemones showing consistent positive responses
to light.
Symbiotic anemones were made to lose their endo¬
symbionts by incubation at 30-32°0 for 2-5 days as described
by Buchsbaum (1968). These anemones reacted like the
naturally aposymbiotic anemones (table Ia).
Each of 10 anemones were subject to two defined spots
of light on opposite sides of their bodies. Eight of the
10 elongated in the direction of the lights as shown in
-equr 2
figure 2. The other 2 moved into the dark.
Oxygen Alteration
Oxygen was bubbled through a column of flowing sea water
which then ran continuously into an aquarium. Another
aquarium was treated similarly using nitrogen aeration.
Winkler analyses (Carritt and Carpenter, 1966) of oxygen
content yeilded: 18.6 ml. 0/1. in the oxygenated tank;
4.5 ml. 02/1. in the nitrogenated tank. Before aeration the
oxygen content of the sea water was 7.2 ml. 00/1. Both
symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals were tested, The test
conditions were otherwise those of the previous light-dark
experiment. The results are summarized in table Ib. Only
symbiotic animals in the oxygen depleted tank showed
consistent and significant phototaxis, aposymbiotic dem¬
onstrated no response to the light (pe.002, Fisher's exact
test for independence).
