Cxygen affects on anemone movement
through all of the 4 described conditions, but the order of
exposure to the conditions differjed for each clone.
The results are listed in table III. The clones
showed significantly more spacing in the dark than in the
light (pe.02, T test for paired comparisons). The clones
showed significantly greater spacing under oxygen depleted
conditions compared to oxygen saturated conditions (pe.02.
T test for paired comparisons). There was no significant
difference either between spacing of animals in the light
and those in the oxygen rich-water, or between those in
tble I
the dark and those in the oxygen-poor water.
DISCUSSION
Oxygen is the only photosynthetic product needed to
ensure phototaxis. A symbiotic anemone's phototactic
behavior is stopped by increasing ambient oxygen concenÂ¬
tration. Anemones move away from areas of low oxygen
tension to areas of higher oxygen tension. From these
results it can be inferred that components other than
oxygen are neither necessary nor sufficient in the photo-
tactic response. This reaction must include the ability to
detect an oxygen gradient and to behaviorlly respond to
that gradient. Anemones are apparently able to pick-up
oxygen differences at least as small as those established
by their endosymbionts when illuminated unequally.
