fects on anemone movement
Oxygen-taxis
Single anemones were made to settle between 2 barriers
in an aquarium, thereby dividing the tank into 2 separate
chambers (figure 3). The water level was maintained equal
to anemone height to prevent water exchange between the 2
compartments. Oxygen concentration on each side of the
anemone was that of the previous experiments: 18.6 ml.
02/1. and 4.5 ml. 02/1. Experiments were run 24 hours in
the dark. Movement was scored if the anemone moved at
least half its body diamenter towards either side. æfu
Six of the 6 symbiotic anemones and 6 of the 6 apo¬
symbiotic moved towards the oxygen saturated side of the
tank. Both results were significantly different from
random movement (pe.025, chi-squared evaluation).
Induced anemone movement with respect to an oxygen
gradient was also observed during the 30-32°0 incubation
done to purge zooxanthellae. At the end of each period,
surviving anemones (12) were either attached to or clustered
around one of 2 air stones used to aerate the water.
Clonal Distribution: Field Studies
Three aposymbiotic and 3 symbiotic clones of Anthopleura
elegantissima were selected for study in the field. Each
of 12 anemones from the center of each clone was scored
according to its degree of clonal spacing, using the
following scoring system: Zero for anemones touching
clone-mates on all sides, 1 if touching on more than 75%
