90 micron NITEX. Sperm/Egg Ratio 33. SD of jellied eggs-4.1; SD of dejellied
eggs - 2.4 and values are not significantly different.
Figure Nine ... Percent Fertilization With & Without Speract. Experiment
carried out in turbulence. Jelly removed by filtering eggs through 90 micron
NITEX Sperm/Egg Ratio 9. SD of jellied without speract - 2.1 SD of jellied with
speract - 1.4; SD of dejellied without speract - 2.8; SD of dejellied with speract :
2.8 1.0-2.5% jellied eggs with & without speract from same population; 2.5-5%
chance dejellied eggs with & without speract from same population. Three
replicates completed at speed 2 (low turbulence).

Figure Eleven . . .Percent Acrosome Reaction With & Without Speract.
Experiment carried out with both methods; both gave same result (see methods &
materials). No sperm/egg ratio. SD without speract - 4.9; SD with speract - 4.9.
Two replicates completed.
