purpuratus eggs and sperm in high turbulence (speed 5) produced 33% fertilized
eggs at a sperm/egg ratio of 3200:1; gametes of the same urchin at an identical
sperm/egg ratio gave fertilization rates of only 15.5% (Figure Three). The
addition of 10 nM speract to gametes in low turbulence (speed 2) produced
45.3% fertilization at a sperm/egg ratio of 8.8:1; gametes of the same urchin at
an identical sperm/egg ratio gave fertilization rates of only 27.3% (Figure Four).
Success of Fertilization in Presence of Speract
The above results showed that 10 nM speract increases fertilization in
turbulence at speeds 2 and 5; this was also the case in a test-tube or standard
laboratory fertilization procedure. The addition of 10 nM speract to gametes in
the test-tube assay increased fertilization to 21% at a sperm/egg ratio of 26.7:1.
Gametes from an identical urchin at the same sperm/egg ratio with no addition of
speract only resulted in 6.6% fertilization (Figure Six).
Speract Concentration and Success of Fertilization
The effects of different speract concentrations are shown in figure seven,
using a sperm/egg ratio of 26.7:1. I found the greatest effect by speract was
attained at 20 nM with a sperm/egg ratio of 26.7. At concentrations above 20
nM, fertilization rates reached a plateau; concentrations below 10 nM were less
effective at increasing fertilization than at 10 nM (Figure Seven).
Speract and the Jelly Layer
Speract is present in the jelly layer, and I wondered what effect removal of
the jelly layer would have, and also whether speract would have an effect.
Dejellying eggs in the standard test-tube assay had no effect on fertilization
(Figure Eight).
