ABSTRACT
It was demonstrated that the addition of 10 nM speract to gametes of
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus dramatically increases fertilization in standard
laboratory conditions and under the effect of turbulence. Such an increase in
fertilization has not been observed by other researchers; the difference in results
is likely due to variations in experiment conditions, in particular egg suspension
(personal communications from D. Garbers, N. Suzuki, and V.D. Vacquier).
Speract's mechanism of action remains unresolved; this paper suggests that there
is a low-affinity receptor on the sperm tail to which speract binds, possibly
causing changes in sperm metabolism.
INTRODUCTION
Adult urchins, such as Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, shed gametes
simultaneously into the ocean, but gamete interactions are a rare event
(Pennington, 1985). In some instances, chemotaxis assists sperm in finding eggs;
no such activity has been demonstrated in S. purpuratus (Ward et. al. ,1985).
Yet, the jelly of this species contains peptides which can affect sperm motility and
metabolism. This peptide, speract, has an amino-acid sequence of Gly-Phe-Asp
Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly but has no chemotactic effect on sperm of the
same species (Garbers et al., 1982).
Although speract does not appear to be chemotactic, Suzuki et. al. have
demonstrated that, at pH 6.6, speract can stimulate respiration and motility to the
maximal values observed in normal seawater at pH 8.0 (Suzuki et. al ., 1980;
Repaske & Garbers, 1983). Such activity is normally repressed at pH values
below 7.3 due to an extreme sensitivity of the ATPase in the axonemal dynein in
sperm (Vacquier & Trimmer, 1986). When assayed at a pH of 7.8-8.0, 4.4 nM
speract doubles sperm respiration (see discussion; Repaske & Garbers, 1983).
