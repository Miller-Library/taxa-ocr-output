MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental animals ... S. purpuratus were collected from Point Arena, CA
and maintained at 13-15 °C. Intracoelemic injections of 5M KCl induced gamete
spawning by adult S. purpuratus. Sperm was collected dry and stored at 4°C.
Eggs shed into seawater were washed by allowing them to settle and aspirating
off seawater. Egg concentration was determined by sedimentation in a Bauer-
Schenle tube. Äfter dilution to a 1.2% suspension, they were stirred at 16°C and
used within several hours after collection. When necessary, eggs were dejellied
by filtering them 12 times through a 90 micron NITEX; this was followed by
hand centrifugation and removal of the supernatant containing the jelly.
Dejellying was confirmed by staining the eggs with Sumi dye.
Chemicals ... Dr. David Garbers of Vanderbilt University provided the peptide,
speract, isolated from the egg jelly of S. purpuratus.. Solutions of .0001 M
speract were stored at -10° C; speract appeared to lose its effectiveness after
seven days in solution and thus fresh solutions were made weekly. A solution of
500 mM KCI, pH 8, was employed to inhibit fertilization after 60 seconds (final
molar concentration was 250 mM; Figure One). Sumi dye was used to visualize
jelly layers.
Preparation of sperm suspension ... The number of sperm per microliter of
semen was found by measuring the turbidity of a 1 microliter semen/ 1 ml
seawater solution at 340 nm; spectrophotometer results were compared to a
standard curve determined from hemocytometer counts (Vacquier & Payne,
1973; Figure Two).
