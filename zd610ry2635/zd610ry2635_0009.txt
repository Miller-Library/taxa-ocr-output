the eggs might naturally secrete enough speract to make any effects of added
speract invisible. When I increased the egg suspension to 1.0, I also lowered the
sperm/egg ratio to 3:1 to keep low fertilization rates; I achieved 10.5%
fertilization with 10 nM speract. 11.5% fertilization can be obtained with
gametes from the same female at an identical egg suspension and sperm/egg ratio
with no added speract. This demonstrates that at high egg suspensions and at a
low sperm/egg ratio, there is no apparent effect of 10 nM speract.
Amount of Speract Present in Egg Suspension
The above results suggested that endogenous speract might be sufficiently
high in heavy suspensions to mask any effects of exogenous speract. According
to Yamaguchi et. al., 5 x 10Â° of H. pulcherrimus eggs contain 40 nmoles speract.
No other studies have produced concrete values, or estimates, of the amount of
speract naturally secreted by S. purpuratus or H. pulcherrimus (Yamaguchi et.
al., 1987). Because both species of urchins are almost of identical size, the values
for the amount of speract secreted from H. pulcherrimus were used as the
amount secreted from S. purpuratus.. In a 0.1% suspension of S. purpuratus
eggs, there are 4,000 eggs per ml which produce a total concentration of 32 nM
speract; this number is increased ten-fold to 320 nM when the egg suspension is
raised to 1.0%.
