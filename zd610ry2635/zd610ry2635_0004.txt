Preparation of egg suspension ... All experiments utilized a 0.1% (or 1%, as
indicated) egg suspension. Assuming 3 x 106 egg per packed cc, a 0.1%
suspension was equivalent to 3000 eggs per ml. Sperm egg ratios were
determined by dividing the number of sperm present in a 10 ml (or 20 ml, as
indicated).001 sperm suspension by the number of total eggs present (30,000
eggs in 10 ml or 60,000 eggs in 20 ml).
Equipment ... For experiments involving turbulence, construction of a
turbulence generator involved first hot-gluing plastic mesh (.25 inch holes) to a
600 ml beaker; the beaker was then inserted into a styrofoam block adhered
securely to a Belles Glen Inc. orbital shaker's rotating platform. The rotating
machine's adjustable speeds allowed for a distinction between high and low
turbulence. High turbulence is defined as speed 5 (4.4 rotations per second) and
low turbulence is defined as speed 2 (1.8 rotations per second). Assays were
performed as indicated below, but a 20 ml volume of egg and sperm suspension
was used.
Standard Speract Assay ... All assays, other than the turbulence assay above,
were done in 16 x 150 mm glass test tubes; the procedure involved the addition of
a 1 ml sperm suspension (+/- speract) to 9 ml of a 0.1 % egg suspension,
inverting the tube for adequate gamete interaction at 15 second intervals, and
adding 10 ml of 500 mM KCl at 60 seconds to prevent more fertilization.
Percent fertilization was determined by incubating the fertilized eggs at 16 Â°C for
20 minutes and then scoring the number of eggs with hyaline layers on the first
100 eggs observed under 10 X magnification in phase contrast microscopy.
Three replicates of each experiment were performed. Unless otherwise
