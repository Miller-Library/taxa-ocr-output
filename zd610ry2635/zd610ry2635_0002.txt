Speract has also been shown to increase the levels of both cyclic AMP and cyclic
GMP along with inducing net H+ efflux from sperm cells (Garbers et al.., 1982).
Yamaguchi et. al. has observed that speract augments the effect of the fucose
sulfate polysaccharide observed by Garbers to induce the acrosome reaction in H.
pulcherrimus (Yamaguchi et. al.., 1987).
This study was designed to investigate the role of speract on fertilization at
the physiological pH of seawater, 8.0, in S. purpuratus.. I examined speract's
effects at a low egg suspension and at a small sperm/egg ratio and found that
under these conditions, there is a significant enhancement of fertilization.
Speract'â€™s mechanism of action in improving fertilization remains unknown, but
the results of this paper suggest that there is also a low-affinity receptor for
speract; the potential receptor binds at nM concentrations perhaps causing
changes in sperm metabolism which increase fertilization rates.
