1 next examined the effects of jelly removal in low turbulence. At a
sperm/egg ratio of 9:1 in low turbulence, 24.5% of jellied eggs fertilized;
addition of 10 nM speract increased fertilization rates to 39% (Figure Nine).
Dejellying the eggs lowered fertilization rates to 7%; addition of 10 nM speract
to dejellied eggs increased fertilization rates to 24% (Figure Nine).
Speract's Effect on Acrosome Reaction
Yamaguchi et. al. has observed (with H. pulcherrimus gametes) that
speract acts as a cofactor in the acrosome reaction alongside fucose sulfate
polysaccharide (Yamaguchi et. al., 1987). Because it was not known if speract
was affecting motility, respiration, or the acrosome reaction at pH 8.0, I
measured speract's effects on spontaneous acrosome reactions. In samples
containing 1 microliter of sperm in seawater, 2% of sperm undergo spontaneous
acrosome reactions; addition of lOnM speract gives 1% acrosome reactions.
Therefore, it appears that, by itself, 10 nM speract has no effect on sperm
reactivity (Figure Ten; Figure Eleven). Ã–ther studies have demonstrated
similarly low figures for spontaneous acrosome reactions (Collins & Epel, 1977;
Clapper et. al, 1985). In the presence of egg jelly, 64% of sperm undergo
acrosome reactions; addition of 10 nM speract in the presence of egg jelly results
in 56% acrosome reactions (no significant difference).
Egg Suspension and Effect of Speract
The effect that I observed with speract was puzzling because such
observations had not been seen by other researchers (personal communications
from D. Garbers, N. Suzuki, & V.D. Vacquier). One possible explanation was
that in the situations used by otbers a high concentration of eggs was used; if so,
