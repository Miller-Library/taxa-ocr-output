All calculated values for â€™t' were compared against a standard table to determine
significance of data (Snedecor, 1956).
RESULTS
KCl and Inhibition of Fertilization
1 wanted to assess gamete interactions for a fixed interval (60 seconds) and
therefore needed a convenient method to interrupt fertilization. High KCl
inhibits fertilization, and I therefore tested various KCl concentrations to
determine the lowest concentration required to achieve such an effect. I found
that addition of isotonic (0.5 M) KCl for a final concentration of 250 mM KCI
completely inhibits fertilization and allows fertilized eggs to develop normally
(Figure One).
Fertilization in Turbulence
No research has yet examined the success of S. purpuratus fertilization
during turbulence, and thus, the turbulence generator was constructed to simulate
natural turbulence under laboratory conditions. I found that fertilization in high
turbulence (speed 5) occurs only with much higher sperm/egg ratios than those
needed for the same percent fertilization in low turbulence (speed 2). Using eggs
from the same female for all trials, a sperm/egg ratio of 80:1 was needed to
achieve 74% fertilization in low turbulence (speed 2) while 70% fertilization in
high turbulence (speed 5) required a sperm/egg ratio of 13,200:1 (Figure Three).
Speract's Effects in Turbulence
Having found much difficulty in attaining fertilization in high turbulence
(speed 5), I asked whether the egg peptide, speract, would have any effect on
fertilization in a high turbulence situation. The addition of 10 nM speract to S.
