be used. Because of this, a low-affinity receptor may not have been detected
(Garbers, 1989). He also suggests that receptor molecules not capable of covalent
coupling with GGGY2) due to lack of a necessary functional group at the binding
site may exist (Garbers, 1989; Dangott & Garbers, 1984). It therefore remains
extremely plausible that there is another receptor yet to be identified.
The isolation of the high-affinity speract receptor was carried out at pH 6.6
(Dangott & Garbers, 1984). The experiments were probably performed at this
non-physiological pH because the increase in sperm respiration and motility
appear more dramatic at a low pH of 6.6. It is possible that the isolated highÂ¬
affinity receptor is a high-affinity receptor at low pH and a low-affinity receptor
at high pH. Thus, there may be just one receptor.
Supposing that there are two receptors, the function of the second, a low-
affinity receptor, may be to signal the sperm that it is very close to the egg and
hence has an excellence opportunity to fertilize; it's binding of such a low-affinity
receptor may also intensify changes activated by binding of the high-affinity
receptor. There is also the possibility that binding of the high-affinity receptor
acts to increase the sperm motility and respiration so that the sperm can reach the
egg, and that binding of the low-affinity receptor informs the sperm that it has
reached the egg and that it should prepare to fertilize.
Speract has now been demonstrated to improve fertilization rates, but
whether such increases are necessary for S. purpuratus fertilization in the marine
intertidal stand unresolved. Because speract has already been implicated in many
fundamental aspects of sperm metabolism, however, its biological role in
fertilization is likely to be quite significant.
