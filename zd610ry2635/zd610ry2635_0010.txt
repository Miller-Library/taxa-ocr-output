DISCUSSION
Speract was first isolated and purified from the egg jelly of S. purpuratus
nearly a decade ago, and at non-physiological pH (pH 6.6), has been
demonstrated to have significant physiological effects on sperm such as increased
motility and respiration, activation of K channels in the flagellar membrane,
K+ efflux and membrane hyperpolarization, cyclic nucelotide turnover possibly
responsible for Naâ€œ entry, pHj increase, and Ca+ entry and removal (Repaske &
Garbers,1983; Lee, 1988; Schackmann & Chock, 1986; Garbers, 1989). Results
of my study are the first to show that at a particularly low egg suspension, low
sperm/egg ratio, and physiological pH, 10 nM speract improves fertilization
rates.
Perhaps the speract-induced increase in fertilization has not been
previously seen because of the conditions under which these experiments were
done. The amount of sperm used has been a critical variable in this study, and
sperm differs in number per microliter of semen from male to male; much of the
literature does not concern itself with exact numbers of sperm used, but it
appears to be of extreme importance (Dinnel et. al., 1987). The other crucial
factor involved was egg titer; higher egg titers secrete large quantities of speract,
making any addition of speract insignificant to the amount naturally present.
Although speract has been shown to increase fertilization in this study, its
absolute role is unclear. Because speract has already been demonstrated to
influence several components of sperm metabolism, the mechanism by which it
increases fertilization is likely an indirect one (Garbers, 1989; Repaske &
Garbers, 1983; Lee ,1988; Schackmann & Chock, 1986). Speract's method of
action stands unresolved, but several postulates for it exist.
