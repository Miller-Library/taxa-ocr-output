indicated, all experiments were carried out at pH 8.0 and at an egg suspension of
0.1 %.
Acrosome Reaction ... Two methods were used to measure percent acrosome
reaction:
Method 1.) Addition of a one-fifth volume of 37% formaldehyde to each sample
fixed the sperm (final formaldehyde concentration was 7.4%). One drop of fixed
sample was placed on a coverslip which was then placed sample-side-down onto
Kimwipes. The coverslip was thumb-squashed onto the Kimwipe to remove
excess water without moving or splintering the coverslip. The sample was then
observed with oil immersion viewing under 100 x phase contrast microscopy.
Percent acrosome reaction was scored by counting the first 100 sperm observed.
Method 2.) Addition of a one-tenth volume of 37% formaldehyde to each sample
fixed the sperm (final formaldehyde concentration was 3.7%). Ã„fter a settling
time of six hours, 5 microliters from the bottom of the sample tube were pipetted
onto colloiden & carbon coated nickel grids; excess sample was blotted off after
five minutes. The grids were rinsed in distilled water; extra water was
immediately absorbed with filter paper. Percent acrosome reaction was scored
by counting the first 100 sperm observed with the electron microscope.
Statistical Analysis of Data
All data were analyzed by the T test to determine if observed differences in
means were sufficiently different from one another and not due to random
variation in the data collection.
