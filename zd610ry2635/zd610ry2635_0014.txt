FIGURE LEGEND
Figure One ... Percent Fertilization versus KCl Concentration. The indicated
KCl concentrations were added to gametes at 60 seconds to interrupt fertilization.
Three Replicates Completed. Standard deviation (SD) of 100 mM is 1.2; SD of
150 mM is 5.6; SD of 200 mM is 10.6; SD of 250 mM is 0.3.
Figure Two ... Turbidity versus sperm per ml sea water. Semen of S.
purpuratus was suspended in sea water and formaldehyde (see results). Turbidity
was measured at 340 nM. The number of sperm per ml was determined by
hemocytometer counts. Three replicates completed for each hemocytometer
count.
Figure Three .. .Percent Fertilization Versus Sperm/Egg Ratio in Turbulence.
Experiments done in turbulence of speeds 2 and 5. Three replicates completed.
No fertilization at sperm/egg ratio of 80:1 at speed 5. SD of speed 2 at
sperm/egg ratio of 80:1 is 2.3; SD of speed 2 at sperm/egg ratio of 13200:1 is
0.9; SD of speed 5 at sperm/egg ratio of 13200:1 is 3.6.
Figure Four . .. Percent Fertilization With & Without Speract at Speed 5.
Experiment done in turbulence at speed 5. Sperm/Egg Ratio of 3200:1. SD
without speract - 0.7; SD with speract - 2.8. 2.5-1.0% chance from same
population. Three replicates completed speed five (high turbulence).
Figure Five . . .Percent Fertilization With & Without Speract at Speed 2.
Experiment carried out in turbulence at speed 2. Sperm/Egg Ratio of 8.8:1. SD
without speract - 13.5;SD with speract -15.1. 10-20% chance from same
population. Three replicates completed at speed 2 (low turbulence).
Figure Six ... Percent Fertilization With & Without Speract. Experiment
carried out by standard test-tube assay. Sperm/Egg Ratio of 26.7:1. SD without
speract - 2.5; SD with speract - 6.0. 0.5- 0.1% chance from same population.
Three replicates made.
Figure Seven .. .Percent Fertilization Versus Speract Concentration. Experiment
carried out by standard test-tube assay. O nM speract gave 15.3% fert; 5 nM
speract gave 22.3% fert.; 10 nM speract gave 27.6% fert.; 20 nM speract gave
37.3% fert.; 40 nM speract gave 32.0% fert.; 100 nM speract gave 29.0% fert.;
Sperm/Egg Ratio 26.7:1. Three replicates made. SD at 5 nM is 2.2; SD at 10 nM
is 2.3; SD at 20 nM is 1.2; SD at 40 nM is 5.2; SD at 100 nM is 6.7.
