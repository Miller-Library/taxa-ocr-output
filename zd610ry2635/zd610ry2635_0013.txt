ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 am deeply indebted to Professor David Epel for his direction, patience,
and great enthusiasm in this research project; his advice and suggestions have
been extremely insightful and invaluable. Dr. David Garbers of Vanderbilt
University provided the peptide speract, and so to him and to Dr. Epel I am
grateful for giving me the opportunity to explore speract's capabilities. I also
thank Professor Mark Denny for his assistance with my original project ideas
involving turbulence. Also, I give a special thanks to members of Professor
Epel's lab - to Rob Swezy, for his willingness to be of assistance at any time; to
Denis Larochelle for his lessons in microscopy; and to Chris Patton for his expert
assistance with electron microscope techniques. Thanks also to Sam Wang who
was readily available throughout the quarter for discussion and did a fantastic job
with the slides.
