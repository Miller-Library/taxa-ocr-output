MALE ISOPOD REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES
Although a groat deal of work has been done on sexual determina-
tion and chromosomes of isopods (see Staiger and Bocquet, 1956, and
Teichmann, 1962 for roviews and full references) little has beon re-
ported on tho morphology of the testes used by most of these studies,
Several authors have included decriptions of specializations of the
male pleopods in their broad surveys of isopods (Richardson, 1905;
Van Name, 1936; Menzies, 1950; Gruner, 1965; Schmolzer, 1965) and
some have included drawings of the pleopods of the Oniscoidea covered
in this paper (Richardson, 1905; Van name, 1936; Hatch, 1947;). Other
aspects of the biology of the eight species studied here have been
reported (Miller, 1936; Ricketts and Calvin, 1939; Menzies, 1950)
but this information did not include drawings or descriptions of the
testes of any species or of the modifications of the male pleopods
in any species of the Flabellifera or Valvifera. This study was car-
ried out to fill in these gaps in our knowledge of these isopods,
ETHODS
The animals studied were collected from intertidal and moist terres-
trial habitats on the Monterey Peninsula. They were either fixed in
ethanol or anesthetized with 15% MgCl. Two or three males of each spe-
cies were dissected from the ventral surface to expose the testes, All
drawings were made with the aid of a camera lucida.
