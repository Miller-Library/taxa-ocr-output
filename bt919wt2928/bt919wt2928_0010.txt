MALF ISOFOD REPRODUCTIVE STRUC!
ACKNOWLEDCE
MSI
I am grateful to Dr. Isabella Abbott for her aid and advice through-
out this project and to Feggy Houk and Bill Johnson for their help
in my literature search.
SUMMARY
Dissections and drawings (with camera lucida) were made of the
testes and endopodites of eight species of California isopods. The
Oniscoidea represented by Alloniscus percorvexus, Armadillidium vul
gare, Ligia occidentalis, and Porcellio scaber have three uniformly
spaced, elongate testes attached to a seminal vesicle at various posi-
tions in the body cavity. All but Ligia occidentalis have a broad
projection from the first endopodite and a sickle-like style from the
second endopodite. The Valvifera are represented by Idothea (Pent-
idotea) resicata and Idothea (Pentidotea) stenops. Both of these spe-
cies have similar elongate testes spread down a thin vas deferens.
There are no special modifications of the first endopodites in either
species and the second endopodites have a long uniformly wide style.
The Flabellifera also show similarities within the suborder. Cirolana
harfordi and small Lironeca vulgaris both have bulbous, sac-like tes-
tes extending from the apex of a narrow vas deferens which may take
many different paths in C. harfordi. The larger L. vulgaris has only
an amorphous mass of tissue for testes as it begins its transforma-
tion to a female. All three forms have similar tapering styles on the
second endopodites.
The patterns of variation of testes structure between suborders
and the similarities between them were noted,
