MALE ISOFOD REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURS
DISCUSSION
This study points out that the most variation in male reproduc-
tive structures takes place between suborders and the least between
species of the same genus. The testes are of different shapes and in
different positions in the body cavity, but there are always two sets
of three testes to each male (excepting protandrous forms in transi-
tion) and a vas deferens with variably positioned expansions always
leads from these testes toward the pleotelson. All the species exam-
ined have styles on the second endopodites, presumably to aid in
sperm transport, and some have similar modifications of the first
pair of endopodites. These similarities in reproductive structures
occur where they would be expected if the taxonomy of these isopods
successfully described their phylogeny. Taxonomy in the Isopoda is
usually based on the structure of mouthparts and the shape of body
regions.
The variations observed within suborders probably relate to dif-
ferences in the feeding or reproductive habits of these animals, but
more research is needed to document these relations,
