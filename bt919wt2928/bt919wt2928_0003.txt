Figure 4 A-D are of the right testes and the left first and sec-
ond endopodites of the four species of Oniscoidea examined above. In
all four species the testes consist of three elongate tubular struc-
tures connected to a sac-like seminal vesicle at uniform intervals
and leading to a vas deferens. The broad, tapering extensions of the
first endopodites are very similar in Alloniscus perconvexus (A), Arm-
adillilium vulgare (B), and Porcellio scaber (D) but is almost absent
from Ligia occidentalis (C). The styles on the second endopodites
are narrow and sickle-like in A. perconvexus (A), A. vulgare (B), and
P. scaber (D), but much broader and more rounded in L. occidentalis (C).
Figure 5 A-E are these same details for the members of the Valvi-
fera and Flabellifera I examined. Both the testes and the endopodites
of Idothea resicata (A) are very similar to those of Idothea stenops.
The widely spaced, narrow, pointed testes of the Valvifera are in
marked contrast to the broad, bulbous testes of the Flabellifera
which all branch from the end of the vas deferens. The testes and
endopodites of Cirolana harfordi (C) are very much like those of a
small Lironeca vulgaris (D) except for the natatory hairs on the ple-
opods of C. harfordi. The larger Lironeca vulgaris (E) has pleopods
with the tapering style on the second endopodite as on the other males
in this suborder (and the female L. vulgaris) but the testes have lost
much of their form and appear to be in a state of transition or degenÂ¬
eration.
