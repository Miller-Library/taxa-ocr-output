MALE ISOPOD REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES
SULT
Figure 1 A-D are of the suborder Oniscoidea and represent four
gonera Alloniscus (4), Armadillium (B), Ligia (C), and Porcellio (D).
The testes may be seen in figure A to extend anteriorly only as far
as the third segment of the pereon while those in figure C extend in-
to the cephalon. Figures B and D show testes of similar form with po-
sitions between these two extremes.
Figure 2 A and B are of the suborder Valvifera and represent two
species of the genus Idothea (Pentidothea). The testes are very sim-
ilar in their form and position and both sets connect to vas deferens
which terminate in the paired penis structure extending posteriorly
from the last segment of the pereon. The uropods of both species have
been pinned open to reveal the pleopods and the tips of the styles on
the second pair of endopodites are visible in I. stenops (B).
Figure 3 A-D are representations of the testes in two genera of
the suborder Flabellifera. In A, the testes of Cirolana harfordi are
seen to lie at the fourth or fifth segment of the pereon and to con-
nect to two vas deferens which extend back under the pleopods to a
region near the anus. The vas deferens can take many different paths.
four more of which are seen in B. In C, the testes of a small Liron-
eca vulgaris are seen to have a similar form to those of C. harfordi
except that they are located at the third or fourth segment of the
pereon and theirvas deferens extend posteriorly to a small paired
penis on the last thoracic segment. The testes of a larger L. vulgar-
is are seen in D to be amorphous masses of tissue as this protandrous
form begins its conversion to a female.
