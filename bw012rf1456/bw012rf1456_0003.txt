aqueous solution of the crude pigment. This precipitate was also
soluble in water, and in Tegula funebralis, by a Folin protein test
it indicated that thereis 3.6mg of protein per ml of "standard'
solution of crude pigment.
The pigments were all pH indicators in the alkaline range.
They all appeared yellow to orange, depending on concentration,
at pH 9.5. The spectra of the pigment from Tegula brunnea in the
acid and alkaline states appears in the attached sheets. The
exact turning point of the T. brunnea was determined at 8.3 pH.
All the pigments were observed to be reduced by the addition
of Nag S2 O (sodium hyposulfite). The pigments, however, could
not be induced to reoxidize by addition of sodium peroxide or
auto-oxidation by bubbling with air. An attempt was also made to
reduce the pigments under the less severe conditions of anoxia by
nitrogen bubbling through them. This was unsucessful.
In the case, of Tegula funebralis it was calculated that it
takes 5.7x102 M sodium hyposulfite to reduce the pigment to the
yellow state. It is noted that upon reduction the visible peak
at 650mu is removed; however, the ultra violet peaks at 271 and 325mu
remain the same. (the absorption spectra are included).
The configuration of all the spectra of these various pigments
are similar; however, the absorption peaks vary within a range of
4Omu in the visible and 2 to 10mu for th UV peaks. It would seem
that perhaps the compounds are members of the same family. This
asumption is further supported by identical solubilities and
behavior toward hydrogen ion concentration.
