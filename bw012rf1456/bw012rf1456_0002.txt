The unknown green pigment from Tegula funebralis and the similar
green pigments from Tegula brunnea, Tegula montereyi, Tegula pulligo,
the red and black abalone (Haliotis) are the pigments under study.
The unknown green pigments were extracted with methanol in all
cases. The procedure of extraction and removal of the carotenoid
contaminations are as follows:
The gonad of the organism is removed and placed in a waring
blender with 100% methanol. The supernatant from this process
is then centrifuged to remove all the tissue particles. This
solution is taken to dryness on a vacuum distiller at not more than
40Â°C. The pigments are then redissolved in water. The aqueous
solution is then partitioned with anhydrous ether; the green
pigment remains in the aqueous phase and the carotenoids move to
the ether phase. Thi process is repeated with fresh ether until
the yellow color in the ether has disappeared. The aqueous green
pigment is then taken to dryness and redissolved in distilled
water two times. The pigment in this state is what I refer to
as the crude pigment. The absorption spectra of the pigments in this
stage are provided in the attached sheets.
The pigments, in all cases, were observed to have the
characteristics of pH indicators after the pH was initially taken
to 11. At pH 11, a precipitation is formed. This precipitation
was found to be soluble in distilled water at pH 4 to 6. A similar
precipitation may also be obtatined by addition of acetone to an
