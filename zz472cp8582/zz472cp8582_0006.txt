returned to the Bay and forty new C. manaliculatum were collected.
These were divided up inte greups af ten and placed in the faur
tankz mentiened abeve. This hatch was nat induced te secrete the
slime befere heing placed inte the tanks. After ane week, all
forty snailz underwent the zegretien precess, and amounts and
bicassay recordings were made as described abeve.

A predictable escape respense was determined for .
camaliculatum from Pyenapedia on both horizental and vertical
surfaces. On the herizantal zubstratum the follewing was
abserved:
1) When a Exenepedia tume foct was touched to the head
tentacles af O gamaliculatum, the snail quickly turned
auay from the stimulated area (Fiq. 2).
2) When "attacked" from behind C. canaliculatum lifts up its
shell and begins to ru away. Approximately 50 af the
spails tested in this maner released the hypebranchial
secretien while they were rumming, and this tends te
stick to the snail's shell and mucus trail (Fig. 3).
3) Ofter repeated stimdlatien from behind, the soail begins
te ratate its shell back and forth while threwing its fact
adainst the substratum gausing a samersaulting reactien
away from the Fyenapadia. In 1004 of animals tested, the
yellaw secretion respense takes place in canjustic
with this mevement, wrapping armund the snail as it
retates (Fig. 4).
4) Once on its back the snail continues to rotate its foot
until it is stimulated again by the tube fest. Ot this
peint the animal retracts most of the way into its shell,
dives a final pulse that shects out mare exudate, and
pulls all the way back into itz shell (Fig. S).
Un the vertical substratum the follawing was abserved:
