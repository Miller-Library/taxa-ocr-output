seems to be yet more evidence for the observation that the release

with the impertant exception af the hypchranchial secretion (Harreld,
1781: Herrlinger, 1783). Thus, it seems evident that the intensity
of the Cy canaliculatum escape response is directly correlated to the
Fycnepedia's dietary preferencey this correlation between actively
esgaping from predators and the abundance of prey that ended up in
the diet has been extensively studied using different predater-prey
relationchips (Feder, 1753. 1747; Fhillips, 1974: Dayten at al.,
