DISCUSSION
Behavieral Experiments:
One preblem I encountered with these studies was the
reluctance af the Eyenapodia to naturally forage after the C.
ganaliculatum in aquaria. Attempts were made to induce the seastar
inte moving in the general direction of the snail placed in the tank
mut to no avail. Therefore, the technique using individual tube
feet described abeve was used to simulate an attacking seastar.
With a nutural predatery event there would be more variability in
timing and persistence. The described behavier represents a
hierarchy of responses to a sustained attack. It would be of great
interest ta ebserve the behavier in the field te decument its form,
success, and ather consequences.
I noticed that for all thirty snails tested the secretion af
the exudate was a last ditch technique used to escape. The C
canaliculatum were very reluctant to release the product. Also, I
aften faund the snails halding en the substrate with the antericr par
af their feet, while the ventral side of the posterior part of their
feet wrapped up onte the dersal surface of their shells. This has
been observed in Ca ligatum as well (Harrald, 1781), and is
apparently used te maintain a mucus layer on the shell. Therefere,
