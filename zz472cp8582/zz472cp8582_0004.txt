Secretion Production Exmeriments:
A total of eighty C. camaliculatum (different from the thirty
used in the above experiments) were cellected an Hay 4, 1988 and
induced to release the yellow substance that day. To collect the
exudate, a snail was held with the aperature up while a Fyenepedia
tube foct was applied to the head of the animal. The snail then
retracted inte its shell while secreting the product mixed in
seawater. This mixture was callected using a micrepipet and
stared in a refrigerated flask.
The snails were then randomly divided inte four groups a
twenty and placed inte seperate running seawater tanks, each
cantaining a different fecd source:
TOMK 1 = Kelp with blades encrusted by sessile
invertebrates
TOMH 2 = Kelp with ne invertebrate
TNaia
lancealata
TAMK 4 = Me Focd
All of the kelp, Macrecystis pymifema, and red algae, Gigartina
corymbifera, were collected off of HMLR using SCUBA. Invertebrates
were remaved from the kelp used in TANK 2 by cheasing ycunger
sections of fronds and washing them off and scrubbing them down.
Twenty-four heurs later five snails were removed fram each tari
and numbered 1-5. These were then induced to release their exudate
using the method descriped above. This process was continued to
produce four sampling regimes within ach tank:
GEGUF 1 - snails 4'd i-S were induced to secrete
every day
ROUP  - snailz 'd 4-10 were induced to secrete
every a days
