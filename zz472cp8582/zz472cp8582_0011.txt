te secrete the substande as the recavery time between induced
semrationz was increased. Further zupport for this conclusion ceme
fram results ahtained in the secend experiment using ferty new snal
that were left in the tanks for a week before being preveked inte the
mecretion precess. All forty of these snails, after one week with ne
predators to attack them, were able to secrete a large amount
(equivalent te the "4" an the scale) of the hypebranchial substance.
But, the eighty eriginal snails that were induced to secrete the
slime en the day they were collected only had a 87.5 pesitive
megretion rate, and not all of them secreted the "A" equivalent.
This indicates that mame af these snails had prebably been recently
attacked in the field and ferced to use the exudate to escape and not
had time te regenerate it befare they were captured. This has the
matential to allow predater-prey studies in free ranging pepulations
by messuring the numbers af attacks that were not successtal.
Furthermere, when comparing the averages calculated for both
the amounts and the bicassay reactions (Figs. 10,11), it appeare
that four days is not encugh time to generate the strang "
reading for the ameunt of secreticn released, but it is a lang
enough time to generate a strengly velatile secretion, therstere
1) The recevery peried necessary te preduce the largest
amaunt of the exudate lies somewhere between the lengest
tested pericd, 4 days, and the ebserved peried at whicn
100 af the Ce canaliculatum population secreted the
sauvalattte aday
2) Singe the "4" on the Eyenepedia reaction scale did net
gerrempond to the "A" an the scale for ameunt at yellew
chzeryed, it appears that the active reagent af the
gampaund daas nat lie in the yellaw part af the substance.
This latter observation is supperted by bicchemical tests run on
