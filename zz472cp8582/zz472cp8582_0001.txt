ABSTRACT
The gastreped Calliastema camaliculatum demonstrates a violen
ape espanet the aa Pypedia ellianthidehee
escape mechanism is a highly complex series af reactions that
culmenates in the secretion of a noxious yellow substance from the
animal's hypebranchial gland. The extent to which C. ganaliculatuun
will ge te escape from Eygnepedia without using the secretien
demenstrates a general reluctance to use the methed if it can be
ayoided. The source of this excretion appears to be endogenous to
C. canaliculatum and does not come from its diet. Once secreted, the
snail needs between 4-7 days te regenerate the substance te its tull
capacity, but four days appears to be sufficient for the
effectiveness of the zubstance to reach its full strength.
