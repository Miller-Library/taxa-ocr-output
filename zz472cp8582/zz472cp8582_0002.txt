INTRODUCTION
The gastroped Calliestema camaliculatum is one of many species
af Mallusca that exhibitz an escape respenze when preveled hy ar
asteroid (Bulleck, 1753; Feder, 1963,1967; Mentgomery, 1767; Mauzey
et al., 1768; Fhillips, 1776; Daytom et al., 1977; Moitza and
Fhillips, 1979; Abbett and Haderlie, 1980; Harrald, 1781, 1982:
Herrlinger, 1783; Watanabe, 1783). C. canaliculatum reacts
particularly vielently to the seastar Fyenspodia heliantheides.
Many of the initial stages of this escape respense are shared with
sther snails of this gemus (Harreld, 1781; Herrlinger, 1783), but
Ca canaliculatum also secretes a moxious yellow substance from its
hypcbranchial gland when stimulated by Eygnepedia (Baxter and Gilly,
personal communication). This added feature to the typical
Calliestoma genus escape mechanism appears to be quite effective.
Herrlinger, 1983, reported that althaugh gastrepeds made up 77 cf
the typical Eymmemedia's diet, enly abeut 1.54 of these were
C. canaliculatum compared to Ca ligatum which makes up almest 25 at
the gastropods eaten. C. ligatum does not display the secretion of
the yellow substance.
The cbjectives of this study were to extensively observe the
stages of C. canaliculatum's escape mechanism from Eyenepodia, to th
extent that it became predictable, and to determine the source af th
noxious exudate as being derived from the snail's diet of the kelp
Macracystis pyrifera, the red algae Gigartina gemymbifema, and the
encrusting invertebrates present on these plants (Hunt, 1977
Sellers, 1977; Abbatt and Haderlie, 1980) ar frem some endogencus
sGurde.
