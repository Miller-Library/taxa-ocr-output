ACKNOMLEDGEMENTS
Chuck Baxter deserves mere thanks than can possibly be
expressed in a few words; he was infinately available wheneyer I
needed him to help me solve my many problems, and the suggestions he
dave me are a large part of the reason this preject was completed.
I would alse like to express my unending gratitude to Tom Otis.
Niels Smaby, and Tiffany Tom for going above and beyond the call of
Guty when it came to diving for me whenever it was necessary (which
turned cut to be quite often). Thanks to Dre. William Gilly and
Stuart Thompsen for their suggestions and interest in the "slime".
and to Rob Sweezey and Chris Fatton for taking time eut to help on
the graphics at a period when their time was in the greatest demand,
Finally, a big thank you to the rest of the class, especially Niels
(my partn√¶r in "slime") and the rest of the residents of 1009 Ferest
Evende, for making these past twe monthe a couple of the mest
memerable in my life.
