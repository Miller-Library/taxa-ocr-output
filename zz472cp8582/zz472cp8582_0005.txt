GEQUF 3 - enails 'd li-is were induced to secrete
avery 3 days
GEOUF 4 - snails 4'd 1-2O were induced te secrete
averyday
The test was conducted for twelve days. Each time a snail underwent
the precess of "being slimed" the ameunt of secretion released was
yisibly determined by the ameunt af yellow product that appeared in
the seawater mixture and recorded. The follewing relative scale was
used to quantify the results:
O pane
pana-deak ameunt sereted
waa amaunt secretd
3 weak-maderate ammunt secreted
4  maderate amaunt zecrete
Sm mederate-strang amaunt secreted
strang amount secreted
The "6" an the scale was equivalent to the amount af exudate
sscreted from the average snail just captured from the ccean.
Ofter gellecting the exudate in Mppendorf tubes and labelling
them, a bicassay was run on a live Eygnepedia. The same seastar
was used for all biclegical tests; the Eycnepodia was removed trom
its holding tank and placed in a container (approximately 12"  6'
3 5") with seawater. A control was run using SOul of ardinary
smawater and "shesting" it at the tip of ene arm of the Eyenepediat
ubserve the response. The test consisted of expesing an arm af the
seastar to a MOul sample (e.g., the peoled collection from snails 1-t
fram the Kelp tank on May S was one sample, etc.) of the secretion
and recording the response on a O-o scale of the strength of behavior
response (Fig.1). The Pyenepedia was then rested for 5 minutes
befare the next SOul sample was administerec.
Finally, after the twelve day testing peried the snails ware
