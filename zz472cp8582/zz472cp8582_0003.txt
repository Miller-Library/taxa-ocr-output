MATERIALS AND METHODS
aperimental imal:
Calligstoma canaliculatum and Eyenspedia heliantheides (hereÂ¬
after Eycnapodia) were collected in the kelp beds off of Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge (HMLR) an Foint Cabrille, Pacific Grove,
California using SCUBA. The C. canaliculatum were mest often
faund feeding en the blades of the brown alga Macrecytis
pymifema and occasionally on the red alga Sidartina
gorymbifera on the sandy bettom.
Behavieral Experiments:
A total of thirty C. canaliculatum were used to determine a
characteristic escape response to Fyenepedia. The snails were kept
in running seawater tanks with plenty of kelp to feed on. One snai
at a time was placed in an 8'x 4'x 2' seawater tank where a
Eycnepedia was being held. Individual tube feet were removed from
the seastar using forceps and then applied to varying parts of the
snail so the behavioral response could be observed. A whole Pyenemee
as kalaattlttv
that the respense was the same as that observed when the individual
tube feet were used. The snails were divided into twe groups of
fifteen and placed on either a horizental or vertical substratum
within the tank. After observations were made, the tested snail was
placed in a seperate holding tank than the untested ones. Unce a
characteristic response could be predicted, illustrations were made
(Fiss, 2-9) to demenstrate the escape mechanism.
