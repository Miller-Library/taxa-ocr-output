Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
photosynthetic capacity of this species decreases markedly
on desiccation, and returns to the original rate and even
somewhat enhanced photosynthetic level upon rehydration.
Lower photosynthetic rates were measured at 0200 h than
were found at 1600 h, suggesting that P. perforata may
possess an endogenous photosynthetic rhythm.
Mitosis:
The highest percentages of dividing cells were found
after the sample sites had been exposed to air for 6 h
and to 4 h of daylight. Values of 77% for site 1 and 98/
for site 2 were found in P.
arorata sampled at 1000 h
(Fig. 4). At that time the sample plants were desiccated
to crispness. Although data are available for only a single
site (site 1) and one sample time (1400 h) for submerged
daylight conditions, only 4% of the counted cells were
observed dividing at this time. With afternoon exposure
plants at site 1 show an increase in mitotic activity, then
falling off in the early evening, and increases again
toward morning. Sample site 2 sustained relatively high
mitotic activity (47 to 63) throughout the late afternoon
and night, decreasing by 0200 h.
Data bars are missing in Figure 4 at those points for
which good squashes showing distinct nuclei could not be
obtained, primarily due to the unpredictable staining
properties of iron-alum-acetocarmine. Unless nuclei were
