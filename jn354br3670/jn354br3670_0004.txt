Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
Rintoul, Page
Porphyra perforata. As yet, whole thallus absorbance in
air has not been measured for littoral algae. My studies
of desiccation effects on Porphyra perforata were attempted
in order to assess the photosynthetic capacities of these
exposed algae.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Spectral Analysis:
Whole thallus absorbance was measured using a Beckman
DK-2A scanning spectophotometer. Samples were prepared
by cutting sections of an intact thallus using a cork
borer, placing them upon a heavy glass coverslip and taping
them into the sample chamber of the spectophotometer with
black electrician's tape, to minimize leakage of the sample
beam around the sample. Part of the same blade from which
the sample was obtained was bleached in a 1:2 Sodium hypo-
chlorite seawater mixture to remove the pigments and to
obtain a blank with similar light scattering properties..
In all further manipulations the sample and the reference
received identical treatment.
Porphyra perforata was collected from the +2.5 tidal
level at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California on the
same day experiments were run. Spectra were taken for fresh
algae, for algae which had been desiccated in a 23Â° oven
with desiccant for four hours, and for algae which had
been rehydrated in seawater for 5 minutes after a similar
period of desiccation. The experiment was repeated using
