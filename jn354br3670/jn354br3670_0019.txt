FIGURE LENGENDS
Figure 1: Whole thallus absorbance spectra for fresh, dried
and rehydrated Porphyra pe
orata, with the
curves labelled appropriately. All readings were
taken with the samples exposed to air.
Figure 2: Whole thallus absorbance spectra for fresh, dried
and rehydrated Porphyra nereocystis. All readings
were taken with the samples exposed to air.
Figure 3: Photosynthetic rates for fresh,dry and rehydrated
P. per
rata as measured in an Infrared Gas
Analyzer. Each rate is labelled withtan expression
for the water content of the sample measured, calcu-
lated as %fresh weight. Two runs were made, at
1600 h on 6/3 and at 0200 h on 5/9, which are
shown as gray and dotted bars, respectively.
Figure 4: The percentage of cells dividing in Porphyra perÂ¬
forata observed for collections taken at 2 h
intervals over a 24 h period from May 8 to May
1978, as represented by the vertical gray bars..
At each sample time the left bar represents
Zmitosis for site 1, and the right bar for site
2. The dotted line labelled"
represents the
light intensity in uE/m/s as measured for each
daylight collection time. The top horizontal bar
is solid
those times
