periods of peak photosynthetic efficiency. Perhaps the
plastids orient to maximize light absorption while the
alga is exposed, thus accounting for the enhanced photo-
synthetic rates in air observed by Johnson et al. (1974).
A recording microphotometer similar to that used to measure
light-induced chromatophore movement in brown algae (Pfau
et al, 1974) might prove useful in documenting desiccation
effects upon plastid orientation.
The peaks for mitosis found in the desiccated P. per-
forata exposed in the daytime were surprising at first,
because this is thought to be a time of maximum stress for
the plant. Pringle and Austin (1970) felt that the diurnal
rhythmicity they found for P. lanceolata was controlled
by fluctuations Win light intensity, independent of the tidal
cycle. Closer analysis of their data reveals that peak
mitotic activity ocurred during periods of exposure, as well
as at night. The investigators did not examine any collections
made from exposed plants during daylight hours.
One would expect mitosis to commence after a period
of high photosynthesis, for cellular products must accumu-
late before division can proceed. Johnson et al. (1974)
report that P. perforata reaches peak photosynthetic
capacity after a period of drying, but that photosynthesis
decreases upon further desiccation. Ability to conduct
mitosis while extremely desiccated would be advantageous
to an alga which must partition alternating periods of
