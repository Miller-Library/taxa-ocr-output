Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
Papenf. at high tide. Austin and Pringle (1968) have found
a diurnal periodicity in mitosis for Rhodomela larix
(Turner) C. Agardh, with little indication of a tidal
influence. A periodicity in mitosis has been demonstrated
for Porphyra lanceolata (Setch. and Hus) Smith, with peaks
in nuclear division coinciding with periods of exposure in
the dark (Pringle and Austin, 1970). No cytological work
with regard to mitotic periodicity has been published on
red algae exposed during the daylight hours.
Porphyra perforata J. F. Agardh, a monostromatic red
alga, was chosen as a suitable species with which to study
the effects of desiccation on cellular processes, because
its high intertidal habitat, the +2.0 to +3.5 ft. above
mean lower low water tidal level in the Monterey Bay region
(Smith, 1944), results in exposure to air for 20-60% of
each 24-hr period (Johnson et al., 1974).
The possibility that pigment absorbance may change
with desiccation of algae was prompted by preliminary
observations that Porphyra perforata appears redder when
desiccated. As the red phycobilins have the highest
quantum efficiency for photosynthesis among the pigments
in red algae (Yocum, 1951), and the photosynthetic action
for P. perforata closely parallels the phycobilin absor-
bance spectrum (Haxo and Blinks, 1950), these observations
suggested increased phycobilin absorbance in P. perforata
upon desiccation. Haxo and Blinks (1950) used thalli sub-
merged in seawater to measure whole thallus absorbance for
