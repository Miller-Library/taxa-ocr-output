Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
Rintoul, Page 14
SUMMARY
1. Fresh Porphyra perforata gives a flat spectrum of high
absorbance when whole thallus absorbance is measured.
Peaks appear in the spectrum when the sample is desic-
cated, and total absorbance is lowered. This behavior
is thought to reflect P. perforata's intertidal habitat,
for the subtidal Porphyra nereocystis gives peaks in
whole thallus absorbance for both fresh and desiccated
samples.
2.
Photosynthesis decreases when P. perforata is desiccated,
to resume to original levels when the sample is
rehydrated. Values recorded at night are lower than
those measured during the day, suggesting a rhythm in
photosynthesis.
3. Cytological examination of a 24 h collection showed the
greatest percentages of cells dividing during daylight
hours when the plants were exposed.
