Desiccation in Porphyra perforata

carbon fixation and cell division within the diurnal and
tidal cycles. The optimal time for mitosis would be those
periods that the plant is unable to conduct photosynthesis,
i.e., during the night and when the plant is desiccated.
Porphyra perforata would be an interesting algal species
with which to document and describe an endogenous photo¬
synthetic rhythm, with particular attention to a possible
tidal component. Studies of mitotic rates of plants kept
in constant laboratory conditions might reveal an endogenous
mitotic rhythm as well, further elucidating the relation¬
ship between photosynthesis, cell division and desiccation
in littoral algae.
