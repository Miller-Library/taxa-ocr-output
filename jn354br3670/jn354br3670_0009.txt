Desiccation in Porphyra perforata

clearly visible the accuracy of the count was question¬
able. In incomplete studies, another technique using
acito-iron-haematoxylin-chloral hydrate stain (Wittman.
1963) was found to be more reliable.
DISCUSSION
The flat spectrum at high absorbance obtained for fresh
perforata was a startling result. The pigments
Porphyr:
must be absorbing light to conduct photosynthesis at the
levels measured for fresh P. perforata in air. The photo-
synthetic rate decreases upon desiccation, when the pig-
ments give more distinct peaks in the spectophotometer. What
accounts for this phenomenon? Perhaps plastids in the cells
released their pigments causing the appearance of more
distinct absorbance peaks in the spectra. A reversible
pigment release is unlikely. Efficient energy transfer in
photosynthesis requires perfect alignment of the pigments
on membranes, and it would seem disadvantageous for the
alga to jeopardize such organization every time the plant
dried out. An irreversible pigment release, while not ex¬
pected to occur in situ, may have resulted from the oven
drying of the sample. The high photosynthetic rates measured
for the rehydrated thalli indicate that this did not
happen. Reversible release remains a possibility
