Desiccation in Porphyra perforata

stained using an iron-alum-acetocarmine s sh technique
(Austin, 1959). Five fields of 20-25 cells per field were
examined under oil immersion, with cells scored as dividing
if two nuclei were visible within the cell, or if two cells
were pressed together with nuclei on opposite sides, indi-
cating recent division. Earlier stages of mitosis could not
be counted because the chromosomes in P. perforata are too
small to visualize with a light microscope.
RESULT
Spectral Analysis:
The spectra obtained for fresh, desiccated, and rehy-
drated Porphyra perforata are shown in Figure 1. Note that
ata gives a flat absorbance spectrum with
fresh P. perf
88% absorbance, and that the desiccated sample gives peaks
for hlorophyll a, allophycocyanin, phycoerythrin and a
combined chlorophyll a carotenoid peak at 430 nm, although
total absorbance was lower than for a fresh sample. Rehy-
drated samples give the same flat spectrum and high absor-
bance obtained for fresh algae. Peaks were also obtained
for both fresh and desiccated samples of P. hereocystis
(Fig 2), demonstrating that the flat spectrum obtained for
wet P. perforata is not merely an artifact of the sample
preparation.
Comparison of the photosynthetic capacities of fresh,
dried and reydrated P. perforata (Fig. 3) shows that the
