Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
ABSTRACT
A study of whole thallus absorbance was combined
with dircect measurements of photosynthesis in air to
assess the phtosynthetic capacity of desiccated Porphyra
perforata. Fresh P. perforata was found to give a flat
absorbance spectrum of high absorbance. Drying of the
sample produces pigment peaks in the spectrum and a reduc¬
tion in the photosynthetic rate. On rehydration, P. per-
forata resumes full photosynthetic capacity, and again
exhibits a flat spectrum at high absorbance. The suggestion
is made that these spectral results reflect an adaptation
to P..perforata's intertidal habitat, for the subtidal
Porphyra nereocystis gave peaks for both desiccated and
fresh samples. In addition, photosynthetic rates measured
during the day were higher than those measured at night,
introducing the possibility that P. perforata possesses
an endogenous photosynthetic rhythm. Cytological exxamina¬
tion of P. perforata collected in situ over a 24 h period
showed greatest mitotic activity when the plants were
exposed during daylight hours.
