Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
INTRODUCTION
High intertidal algae experience extremes of desiccaÂ¬
tion on a daily basis in relation to the tidal cycle. The
conspicuous zonation in this environment has traditionally
been attributed to the relative abilities of different
species to withstand desiccation (Muenscher, 1915; Zaneveld,
1937; Feldmann, 1951; Doty, 1946; Biebl, 1962). Little
attention has been focused upon the continuation of cellu-
lar processes such as photosynthesis and cell division
while intertidal algae are exposed to the air. Stocker and
Holdheide (1938) investigated photosynthesis in exposed
marine algae but did not make comparisonswith submerged
plants. More recently, Johnson et al. (1974) reported
higher rates of photosynthesis in air than in water for
selected intertidal algae. Other recent papers on marine
algal physiology mention aerial photosynthesis only inci-
dentally (Brown and Johnson, 1964; Chapman, 1965; Imada
et al., 1970; Mathieson and Burns, 1971).
There are also few reports on the relationship
between exposure and cell division. The literature relating
to mitotic periodicity has recently been reviewed (Austin
and Pringle, 1968; Pringle and Austin, 1970). Farmer and
Williams (1898) found bursts of cell division in Fucus
immediately following submergence, and Rao (1956) reports
a higher incidence of mitosis in Polyides caprinus (Gunner)
