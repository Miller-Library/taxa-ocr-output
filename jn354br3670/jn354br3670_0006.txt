light intensity of 290 uE/m/s as provided by a tungsten¬
iodide lamp for illumination. These measurements were made
at 15° C. Runs were made at 1200 h on May 29 and at 1600 h
on June 3. No photosynthetic determinaions could be obtain¬
ed for P. nereocystis because of insufficient material.

The sites chosen were two boulders 1.2 m apart and
approximately 30 m west of the Monterey Boatyard launching
rails. Each site supported dense growth of Porphyra
perfor¬
ata. Sample site 1 was a vertical rock face with eastern
exposure, while sample site 2 was on the top of a rounded
boulder. Both sites were situated at the +2.2 ft tidal
level. These sites were chosen for their equal tidal height
and relative ease of accessibility at high tide.
Porphyra perforata from the two sites was sampled
at 2 h intervals over a 24 h period from May 8 to May 9,
1978. Rectangles of 1 x 3 cm were removed from the intact
thalli using iris scissors and were immediately placed in
1 dram vials containing a freshly mixed 1:3 glacial
acetic acid-absolute ethanol mixture. The light intensity
at the sample sites were measured with a Lambda Instrument
Quantum Meter Model 185. Field notes recorded either sub¬
mergence or emergence of the sample sites. Sample prepar¬
ation and storage followed the methods of Pringle and Austin
(1968), which included washing of the fixed material in
absolute ethanol and storage in 70% ethanol. Nuclei were
