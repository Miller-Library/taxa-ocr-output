Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
Rintoul, page 6
Porphyra nereocystis Anderson, collected as drift from
Asilomar Beach, in Pacific Grove.
To determine whether or not the Porphyra perforata
had been irreversibly damaged from the desiccation method,
photosynthetic capacities (P) of the fresh, dried and
rehydrated material were measured. The same sample could
not be measured, dried and then remeasured because a dry¬
ing period of 4 h is necessary to abtain a good spectrum,
and the possibility exists that P. perforata has an endogen-
ous photosynthetic rhythm similar to that found in Iridaea
flaccida (Harris, 1978). With a lapse of four hr between
photosynthetic measurements, differences due to an endogen¬
ous rhythm could not be distinguished from those due to
desiccation. Freshly collected material was divided into
three equal portions. The fresh sample was kept submerged
in a temperature control room at 15° C. The two others were
treated in the same way as the desiccated and rehydrated
samples for the spectral measurements. Both were oven dried
with desiccant for 4 h and one rehydrated at the end of
the drying period. Spectra were taken for all samples
immediately before measuring the photosynthetic rate. Sam¬
ples for taking spectra were not removed directly from
those used for the photosynthetic measurement, but from
separate samples treated identically. The photosynthetic
rate was determined using a Beckman Model 215 Infrared Gas
Analyzer, with a flow-through sample chamber, at saturating
