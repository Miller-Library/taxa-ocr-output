Desiccation in Porphyra perforata
Rintoul, Page 11
So the algae are absorbing light when hydrated, but
appear black to the spectophotometer. The spectrum for
the fresh sample is not flat because the peaks are not
absorbing, but because some effect raises the valleys to
the level of the peaks. Rerunning the spectra with a uni-
formly gray reference, such as a lens tissue, might help
with peak resolution by pushing the spectrum down into the
lower absorbance levels. The optical results indicate
that something happens in hydrated Porphyra perforata as
expressed in the absorbance spectra, which does not occur
in sublittoral P. nereocystis, a species with similar
physical characteristics, thus suggesting an adaptation
of P. perforata to a high intertidal habitat.
The photosynthetic measurements of fresh, dry and reÂ¬
hydrated Porphyra perforata showed conclusively that the
rehydrated sample regained full photosynthetic capacity.
The greater photosynthetic rate attained by the algae after
drying and rehydration was unexpected and may be worthy of
further investigation. In addition, the difference between
rates measured at night and in the day, the latter showing
an increased rate, suggests the possibility of an endogenous
photosynthetic rhythm.
A possible change in plastid orientation within the
desiccated P. perforata cells can be postulated. An endogen-
ous rhythm in chloroplast orientation has been documented
in Ulva (Chlorophyta) (Britz and Briggs, 1976), with the
chloroplast orienting for maximal light absorption during
