and starfish were exchanged after about 10 trials to ensure that the starfish was
naive to the experiment and not stressed by the conditions,
Three controls were done to test the conditions of the treatment. The first
control was an uncoated glass rod that served as the mechanical control for the
movement of the glass rod. The second was a control for the silicone grease which
was simply a glass rod thinly coated with the grease. The third control was a
positive control of a methanol extraction of homogenized mussel tissue,
The results of the starfish assay were analyzed by an ANOVA followed by
Tukey's test.
Results
HPLC results:
The standards from the HPLC were analyzed to determine the relationship
between polyamine concentration and UV absorption as recorded in peak height
so that the bacterial polyamine content could then be quantified. A typical chart
recording from a putrescine standard run is shown in Figure 2. The peak height
varied linearly with concentration of putrescine and the average elution time for
putrescine was found to be between 7 and 8 minutes. The standard peak heights
from the HPLC were plotted against concentration and least squares linear
regression was used to calculate an equation describing the relationship (Figure 3).
Peak height was used rather than peak area because both have been determined to
be linear with concentration (Taibi and Schaivo, 1992) and peak height was
considerably easier to calculate. Cadaverine results are not shown since they are
not applicable to these bacteria. When the equation is rearranged to calculate
concentration from peak height, bo (y intercept) is 12.5 and by(slope) is 598.8. The r
value of .938 is highly significant (p20.01) so this relationship can be used to
accurately determine concentration from peak height.
