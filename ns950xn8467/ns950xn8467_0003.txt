been done to elucidate the role of the release of polyamines. Polyamines are the
breakdown products of proteins (Cohen, 1971) so it is possible that the release of
polyamines is the bacteria's method for metabolizing a protein rich diet.
Polyamine interactions with ion channels are fascinating and have also
been researched as potential therapeutic agents and as tools to help elucidate
aspects of cationic pumps. Some spider toxins have been shown to be polyamines
(Scott et al, 1993). Spidamine and joramine were isolated from the venom of
Nephila clavata and shown to block neuromuscular glutamate channels
irreversibly and reversibly, respectively (Chiba et al, 1995). Polyamines may either
interact directly with the channel by competitively binding to the channel or
indirectly by binding with aspects of the cell membrane to affect voltage gated
channels (Scott et al, 1993).
The purpose of this project was to determine if the bacteria isolated from
the squid egg cases and AN gland were producing polyamines and whether these
polyamines deterred predation. The first priority was to determine whether these
bacteria contained polyamines in concentrations comparable to S. putrefaciens. To
d√©termine putrescine concentration a method developed by Taibi and Schaivo
(1992) for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of polyamines was
used.
The second part of the project was to determine whether the putrescine, if
present, deterred starfish predation. Starfish have chemotactic tube feet that are
accurate indicators of repellent substances and have been used in previous
predator deterrence studies (McClintock et al, 1994). The starfish Pisaster
ochrasceus was chosen for this study because it is a common predator at the depth
of the egg masses.
