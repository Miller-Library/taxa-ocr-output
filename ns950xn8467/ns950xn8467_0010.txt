significantly more than the media whereas V. harveyi did not. The p values were
as follows: S. putrefaciens, p-.002; putrescine, p-.018; strain 10, p-.019; strain 26,
pe.001; V. harveyi, p-.202.
Discussion
The HPLC analysis indicated that the squid bacteria contain putrescine in
large quantities similar to the putrefying bacteria Shewenella putrefaciens. The
starfish tube foot assay demonstrated that the Shewenella spp. bacteria extracts and
à solution of putrescine were more noxious to starfish than media whereas
bacteria without putrescine (V. harveyi) was not. Putrescine produced by the
bacteria might be deterring predation on squid egg cases.
The HPLC proved to be an excellent and relatively simple way to analyze
polyamine content of bacteria. The negative control of V. harveyi and the positive
control of S. putrefaciens allowed exact location of the elution point of putrescine.
Overlaying chart recording from S. putrefaciens and the squid bacteria confirmed
that the peak in the squid bacteria was putrescine. Although the HPLC had
contaminants, these were recognizable and consistent in elution time.
The starfish assay proved to be a bit more problematic, although the controls
were still consistent with literature (McClintock, 1994). The positive control of
müssel showed an average retraction time of about 7 seconds which was similar to
McClintock's finding that the tube foot retraction for positive control was generally
less than 10 seconds. Äfter retraction, which McClintock attributed to the gross
chemical change in environment, the tube feet re-emerge and the arm moves
towards the mussel extract. More puzzling, though, is that McClintock found that
toxins he was testing as deterrents caused tube foot retractions that lasted 40-60
seconds whereas retractions in this experiment were generally observed to be
around 20 seconds suggesting that the bacteria, while still feeding deterrents, were
10
