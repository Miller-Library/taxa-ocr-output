Materials and Methods:
HPLC Determination of Bacteria Putrescine Content:
HPLC instrumentation:
An SCO high performance liquid chromatography machine with a 50 ul
injection loop and a variable wave-length UV detector was used for the
identification and quantification of polyamines in the squid bacteria. Separations
were achieved on a ODS2 column (15 cm x 0.46 cm I.D.; 3 um particle size). All
polyamine standards were obtained from Sigma and HPLC grade reagents were
obtained from Baker.
Bacteria growth conditions and harvest procedure:
Four bacteria were chosen for polyamine content determination. The
positive control was Shewenella putrefaciens (ATCC 8071) previously reported to
synthesize large quantities of putrescine (Hamana and Matsuzaki, 1992) . The
negative control was Vibrio harveyi (ATCC 14126), a bacteria known to have low
levels of putrescine (Yamamoto et al, 1990). Two strains isolated from the squid
gland (referred to as squid strain 10) and squid egg case (squid strain 26) were also
chosen. These bacteria had earlier been identified as Shewenella spp. (Melissa
Kaufman, unpublished work). All bacteria strains were cultured from glycerol
stocks stored at -80Â°C.
The bacteria were grown in Marine Broth (Difco). An overnight culture was
used to inoculate the larger volume used for the experiment. Cell concentration
(mg cell wet weight/ ml broth) was determined by weighing the bacteria in two ml
of bacteria culture. To do this, Ependorf tubes were weighed and then two ml of
culture were added, spun down and the supernatant was removed (one ml at a
time). The tube with the pellet was then weighed.
