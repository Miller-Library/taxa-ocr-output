Derivatization:
All steps of the derivatization took place in acid-washed glassware to reduce
contamination. One ml of each sample was placed in an acid-washed test tube
and 1 ml of 2M sodium hydroxide was added. Five ul of benzoyl chloride were
added then the solution was gently vortexed and then incubated at room
temperature. After 20 minutes, 2 mls of saturated sodium chloride were added to
the test tube. Then a glass Pasteur pipet was used to add 2 mls of diethyl ether.
Glass was used in transferring all ether to avoid plastic contamination. The
mixture was gently vortexed to extract the derivatized compounds to the ether
layer. After centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge (1500 rpm) at low speed for four
minutes, the ether phase was removed and put in a clean tube. Two mls of O.1M
sodium hydroxide was added to the ether phase and again gently vortexed and
centrifuged. After the ether phase was removed to a new tube, a few milligrams of
anhydrous sodium sulfate were added to remove any residual water. The tubes
were centrifuged again and one ml of ether was removed from each tube and dried
under a nitrogen stream.
Chromatographic separation:
The dried sample was resuspended in 500 ul of 62% methanol and put
through a 2 uM filter to eliminate large contaminants. Fifty ul was injected into
the Spherisorb ODS2 column and run at room temperature. Derivatized
polyamines were eluted in 62% methanol at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. and the
UV absorption was detected at 254 nm. The HPLC was run at room temperature.
The UV absorption was recorded with a program written by Chris Patton that
recorded the peak height from the voltmeter every 0.02 seconds.
