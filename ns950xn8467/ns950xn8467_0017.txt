Table 1 Table of the Concentrations of Putrescine in the Bacteria
This table shows the experimentally determined values of putrescine in the four
bacteria that were tested. The number recorded for the Vibrio harveyi is a result of
the equation derived from the least squares regression not passing exactly through
zero. It can be considered the sensitivity level of the HPLC - the Vibrio is sure to
contain an amount less than that number, but the exact amount is impossible to
measure with the current HPLC system.

Table II Table of the Starfish Tube Foot Assay Results
This table shows the mean response time and the standard error for each
treatment. The time recorded is the time from the retraction of the tube foot until
the re-emergence. A number less than about 10 seconds is normal for the positive
control as it represents the response to a rapid change in sensory environment,
An ANOVA and Tukey's test were performed on the log transformation of this
data. The four treatments with putrescine (putrescine, S. putrefaciens, squid strain
10 and squid strain 26) showed significant difference from the media control, but
V. harveyi did not.
