Polyamine extrations were adapted from the procedure of Yamamoto (1990).
To harvest bacteria for the derivatization, 20 mls of a stationary phase bacteria
culture were spun at 5000 x g at 4° C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mls of an
ice-cold solution of 10 mM magnesium chloride with a sodium chloride
concentration equal to that of the growth medium, 19.5 g/L in the case of Marine
Broth. Five mls of 4% perchloric acid was added to the solution. This was
sonicated for 3 minutes in 10 second bursts then incubated for one hour at 50° C.
The solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was
removed and put in sterile, polypropylene tubes.
Three ml were removed from each sample for immediate derivatization,
and the rest of the solution was frozen at -20°C. The three mis were neutralized
with 5 M potassium hydroxide to a pH of approximately 9. Two one mi aliquots
were taken from the neutralized solution and derivatized as described below
before HPLC analysis.
HPLC standards:
Standards were run to determine the relationship between peak height and
polyamine concentration. Standard curves for putrescine and cadaverine were
used since these were the polyamines expected to be in the Shewenella spp. For
each polyamine standard to be quantified, three concentrations were chosen.
derivatizations were done at each concentration, then the sample were run on the
HPLC. Each concentration was done in duplicate and each set of concentrations
was repeated three times. Solutions of 62.5 uM, 125 uM, and 250 uM were made
from a stock solution of 250 mM. The solution was then benzoyl derivatized as
described below (Taibi, et al, 1992).
