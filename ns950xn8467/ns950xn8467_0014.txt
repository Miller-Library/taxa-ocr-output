This study is a step towards a better understanding of how symbiotic bacteria may
contribute to the safeguarding of squid embryos and ultimately how marine
chemical defenses operate.
Conclusion
This study has elucidated two important facts concerning the bacteria that
inhabit the egg cases of the squid Loligo opalescens. High pressure liquid
chromatography of the squid bacteria determined that these bacteria produce
substantial quantities of the polyamine putrescine. A starfish chemotactic tube
foot assay demonstrated that putrescine is noxious to starfish and is a predator
deterrent. These results suggest that the bacteria of the squid egg case prevents
predation by their release of putrescine.
Acknowledgments
Tespecially wish to thank Melissa Kaufman for the time and patience she
gave me this quarter. Thank you also for the excellent guidance on real science,
medical school, and, of course, my project. I also greatly thank David Epel for his
wonderful advice and his insistence that I see all the options without making
assumptions. Thanks also goes to all the people in the Epel Lab - Nancy, Beth,
Lisa, and Chris - for all their support and helpful suggestions.
