Starfish Tube Foot Assay:
The starfish assay was adapted from the protocol of McClintock (1994). It
employs the use of the chemotactic tube foot response to various stimuli to
determine the deterrence of a substance
Methanol extraction:
10 desalt and concentrate samples for the starfish assay, bacteria cultures.
Marine Broth media (Difco), homogenized mussel tissue and putrescine in sterile
sea water at 10 mM were methanol extracted. Two ml of each sample were used
and 4.7 ml of methanol were added to bring the final volume to 70% methanol.
The solution was vortexed and then left to extract at room temperature for about 3
hours then centrifuged for 20 minutes in a clinical centrifuge at 3000 rpm. The
supernatant was removed to new tubes and air dried overnight. The amount of
supernatant removed was recorded and the extractions were resuspended in 1:30
of that volume and refrigerated at 4Â°C.
Behavioral Assay:
The tips of glass rods were thinly coated with a 1:1 mixture of inert silicone
grease (Plumber's Silicone Lubricant) and the experimental (or control) treatment.
The starfish were placed on their aboral side in a small glass tank with enough UV
sterilized sea water to cover them. The glass rod was then placed next to their arm
so that the movement of their arm or the tube feet would bring the feet in contact
with the glass rod. The tube feet towards the tip of the arm were used since these
are known to be more chemosensory (Sloan, 1980). When the tube feet touched
the glass rod they would retract (exceptions being the mechanical and grease
control). Time from retraction to re-emergence of the tube feet was measured and
recorded up to a period of 30 seconds. Each treatment was tested at least 10 times
