Figure 7: Bar Graph of HPLC Results
This graph is a visual representation of the numbers from figure 7. The errors bars
show the standard error. As is evident in this bar graph, S. putrefaciens have a
large amount of putrescine and the squid bacteria, although they donâ€™t have as
much putrescine, contain substantial amounts.
Figure 8: Bar Graph of Starfish Tube Foot Assay Results
This is a graph of the results tabled in table III. The error bars depict the standard
error of the data. From this graph it is clear that the putrescine and the bacteria
containing putrescine deterred the starfish more than media
