INTRODUCTION
Collisella scabra is a homing species of limpet. This
particular species grows its shell margin to fit the substrate at
its home site (Davis, 1895; Underwood, 1979; et al). This
provides protection against removal by predators, as well as
providing resistance to desiccation while the limpet is emerged
at low tide (Branch, 1981, 1986). Because these factors depend
on the ability of C. scabra to return to its home site and orient
properly after a foraging run, a rigid homing instinct is of
paramount importance to its survival.
The mechanism which C. scabra uses to return home is a topic
of some dispute. Several mechanisms have been proposed to
explain this homing ability; these mechanisms fall into three
categories (Cook 1969,1971; Thomas 1973; et al):
1) Use of external cues: these mechanisms rely on
factors not associated with the limpet or the limpet's
home rock. These include the position of the sun and/or
moon, identifying coastal landmarks, polarization of
light, magnetism, and gravity.
2) Dead-Reckoning: this relies on the ability of the
limpet to recall either distances travelled and angles
rotated or linear and angular accelerations and
"compute" an acceptable route home.
3) Use of endogenous clues: these mechanisms rely on
factors associated with or incorporated onto the
surface of the rock. These include following a mucous
trail home, and possessing a topographic memory of the
