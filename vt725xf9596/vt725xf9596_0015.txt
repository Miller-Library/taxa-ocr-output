grouped into the three categories shown in figure 4 (a,b,c),
These are: 1) Platzfrass, 2) taking different outbound and
return routes, and 3) retracing the outward bound path. Each of
these foraging patterns represents a unique aspect of the limpets
homing ability. Limpets partaking in Platzfrass behavior need
only reorient themselves properly on their home site when
finished. As simple as this process sounds, it is actually quite
complex. C. scabra do not orient themselves on their home site
by a trial-and-error process of attempting to obtain a proper
shell fit with the substrate, but instead will leave their shell
raised and turn on their home site until oriented properly and
then lower their shell (Sommer, personal communication and
personal observation). Mucous laid down previously by the limpet
in the Platzfrass behavior, in addition to trapping microscopic
algae and diatomaceous material for later feeding (Connor,
1984c), could serve as a directional clue for proper orientation.
Limpets employ the use of their cephalic tentacles in this
orienting behavior, feeling the area around the home site. Three
of the four limpets which failed to return home in the field
tentacle removal experiment were classified as "not home" due to
improper orientation on the home site. However, the high degree
of proper orientation in limpets lacking tentacles, and the
inability of these limpets to detect trail directionality suggest
that an alternate method may be employed for proper orientation.
Lindberg and Dwyer (1983) reported on the mechanism employed
by C. scabra in excavating their home site depression. They
found that C. scabra secrete acidic mucopolysaccharides from the
