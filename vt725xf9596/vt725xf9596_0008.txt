could be programmed for up to 4 days (two high and two low tides
per day). A series of 7/16" holes was also drilled vertically in
a PVC standpipe to allow for a gradual rising and receding of the
tide.
TRAIL FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS
Using techniques described by Connor (1984b, modified from
Cook & Cook, 1975), the ability of limpets to follow mucous
trails was examined. Glass plates were scrubbed with Alconox,
dipped in a suspension of carbon particles, and rinsed with
Carbon particles adhere to mucous, and
distilled water.
therefore, exposing the plates to this suspension ensured that
mucous was removed from previous experimental trials. The glass
plates were then placed in the tide tank described above and over
a period of 24 hours collected a layer of fine particles. Trails
laid down on these plates appeared as clear trails through the
layer of sediment.
Once a trail was laid down, the limpet was removed and the
plate rotated 90Â° to account for any external cues. Depending on
the experiment, the same limpet or a conspecific was placed .5 cm
from the middle of the trail. Equal numbers of limpets were
placed on each side of the trail to account for any innate
turning preference. Responses to the trail were: 1) no movement
(not used in analysis); 2) crossing the trail; 3) following the
trail toward the origin; or 4) following the trail away from the
origin. Individual limpets were used only once. A trail lasted
30 minutes, and a limpet had to move at least 5 cm along a trail
in order for that trial to be recorded as a positive following
