origin vs. trail following away from the origin were again
compared to 508 expectation values (Table II).
Results of the experiment on intact individuals were
consistent with those found by Connor (1984b). Intact
individuals followed trails more often than they crossed them.
Individuals placed next to their own trails followed them
preferentially toward the origin, while individuals placed next
to trails of conspecifics followed trails preferentially away
from the origin. Limpets with excised tentacles followed
trails more often than they crossed them.
However, the
directional preference found in intact individuals was lost in
the limpets lacking cephalic tentacles.
DISCUSSION
A study of the activity patterns of Collisella scabra at Big
Fisherman's Cove on Santa Catalina Island, CA, reports movement
only during daytime awash periods (Wells, 1980). Wells defines
an awash period as "the time interval during which the zone of
turbulence accompanying the tide is present at a particular
intertidal height." Apparently, the lack of severe wave action,
and accompanying turbulence, at Big Fisherman's Cove caused the
awash period,as Wells defines it, to be restricted to hour long
periods when the limpets were just covered by the ebbing tide.
This pattern of movement is similar to that found by Hewatt
(1940) and Wells (1917). However, Brant (1950) reports that
