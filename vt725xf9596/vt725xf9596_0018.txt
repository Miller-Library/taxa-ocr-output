follow it home. However, if the limpet encounters one of its
trail which hasn't been retraced, such as that in figure 4b, it
would be able to follow this trail to its home site.
A limpet encountering the current trail of a conspecific
would turn and follow the limpet laying down the trail, or meet
that same limpet head-on if the latter was on its return journey
home. A limpet encountering a conspecific's previously laid,
unretraced trail would follow this trail to the other limpet's
home site. The tendency of a limpet to follow a conspecific's
trail in the opposite direction is less well understood. Several
explanations exist, all of which are based only on observations
and theory. The first explanation of this phenomenon is a
territorial behavior; C. scabra could use this mechanism to avoid
territories of other limpets as well as guard their own territory
Alternatively, this mechanism could be
against intruders.
employed by limpets who abandon their home sites to search for
the home site of a conspecific. Since mucous trails ultimately
lead to a home site, it would be beneficial to any limpet away
from its home site (e.g., in the tide tank) to follow the trail
of another limpet in order to find a ready-made home site.
Finally, it could be a form of clustering behavior similar to
that demonstrated in C. digitalis (Millard, 1968).
