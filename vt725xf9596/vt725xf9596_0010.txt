its position in the intertidal region (r - .528, p « .0005). On
the average, smaller animals are located lower in the intertidal
zone, with the size of the animal increasing with intertidal
height. Figure 3 displays the relationship between the size of a
limpet and the maximum distance travelled in a given foraging
excursion. A signifacant relationship was also found to exist in
this case (r - .448, p « .0005). In general, larger animals
travelled greater distances while foraging.
These relationships do not represent a random sample of the
population since study sites were chosen for the presence of C.
scabra; however, there is a significant relationship between the
size of an animal, its position in the intertidal, and the
maximum distance travelled in a given foraging trip.
Furthermore, subsequent observations have shown these patterns to
be representative of this population of C. scabra.
Figures 4a,b,c display some of the common foraging patterns
of C. scabra. Platzfrass (fig. 4a) behavior is evidenced by a
limpet raising its shell and turning on its home site.
Platzfrass or "eating in place" behavior was so termed by Funke
(1968 in Connor 1984b) based on behavioral observations which
suggested that limpets were feeding on a ring of algal material
which grows around the home site in between the perimeter of the
shell and the area occupied by the foot of the limpet. The other
foraging patterns are similar to patterns observed in other
species of homing gastropods. Figure 4b represents foraging runs
in which limpets return to their home site by retracing their
outward paths; figure 4c represents another common foraging
