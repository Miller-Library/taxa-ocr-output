However, using the trail-following theory of homing
al).
exclusively makes it difficult to explain why C. scabra do not
always return home along the same path that was laid down at the
beginning of the foraging run. It is possible that limpets not
returning along the same path are encountering mucous trails
previously laid down, but this would be difficult to detect
without prolonged monitoring of behavior at a site.
Directionality is only present in trails for a period of 48
hours, and it is also unlikely that in displacement experiments
limpets encounter mucous trails with such regularity as to be
able to find their way home more than 808 of the time,
Furthermore, Jessee (1968) showed that scrubbing the surface of a
rock with a 328 solution of NaoH to remove mucous trails did not
inhibit limpets from homing. Similar mucous trail removing
experiments have yielded similar results (Sommer, 1982; Branch
1981). Taken together, these results suggest that one or more
mechanisms exist for limpets to home other than trail-following.
The last type of foraging pattern taken by C. scabra is
typified by retracing an outbound path in the return home and can
be easily explained by the mucous trail-following ability in this
species (Table II). An individual following its own trail to the
place of its origin has obvious consequences on the ability of
the limpet to return home. Upon encountering a current trail,
the limpet need merely retrace it to its home site. It is not
known whether limpets are able to detect directionality of
retraced trails, and limpets encountering a previously retraced
trail may not have the ability to detect its directionality and
