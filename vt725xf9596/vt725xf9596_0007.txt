seawater. Previous studies involving the removal of cephalic
tentacles employed the use of just such a solution to anesthetize
animals and facilitate the tentacle excision (Peters, 1964;
Jessee 1968). However, C. scabra will readily extend their
cephalic tentacles if submerged and placed on their shell. To
facilitate tentacle removal and reduce the size range of limpets
used, C. scabra ranging from 12-15 mm were used in this study.
Although Hewatt (1940) reports limpets smaller than 14 mm do not
home, Jessee (1968, and personal observations) indicates that
only limpets smaller than 6 mm fail to home. A subsequent report
by Sommer (1982) indicates that limpets as small as 2 mm display
homing ability although a higher degree of home site changing is
observed.
In this study, 25 limpets were placed on their shells in a
large petri dish and the tentacles, once extended, were removed
using a pair of iridectomy scissors. 25 other limpets were
removed from the rock and placed in a similar petri dish on their
shells to serve as controls. In these field experiments, limpets
were then immediately replaced to within 6 cm of their home site
on a rising tide, and their ability to return home was noted on
the subsequent low tide.
MOVEMENT DURING SIMULATED TIDE
A tide tank was set up to simulate the rising and falling of
the tide. A series of 7/16" holes were drilled in 1" PVC pipe
and used as spraybars to simulate wave-action. This was attached
to a filtered seawater system through a Rainmatic 2000. This
device has the capacity to execute 8 on/off cycles and hence
