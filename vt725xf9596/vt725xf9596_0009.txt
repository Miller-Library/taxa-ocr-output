excision of the tentacles, but before placement on the glass
plates, limpets were placed in an aquarium for a period of
approximately one hour or until notable movement was observed.
From this point, the procedure described above was repeated.
RESULTS
ACTIVITY PATTERNS
Figures la,b,c display the activity of C. scabra over a 24
hour period at three distinct intertidal heights. No activity
was observed while the limpets were emerged at low tide (15
daylight observations and 2 during low tide at night). The
period of greatest movement was found to correspond to daytime
submerged periods at each site, although substantial movement was
also observed during awash periods, both day and night, and
during nighttime submerged periods. In 8 weeks of observations,
C. scabra was found to strictly adhere to this pattern.
Figure 2 represents the relationship between the size of the
limpet and the study site in which it was found. This figure
shows a significant relationship between the size of a limpet and
