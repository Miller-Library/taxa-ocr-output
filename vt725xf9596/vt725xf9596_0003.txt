rock surface.
The ability of limpets to home after the home rock was displaced
or rotated have demonstrated that C. scabra do not rely
exclusively on external clues for their homing mechanism
(Underwood, 1979). Likewise, the ability of limpets to home in
displacement experiments has eliminated dead-reckoning as the
sole homing mechanism in C. scabra; limpets cannot rely on
remembering their outward trail and be able to return home after
being displaced from their original path (Branch, 1981). The
third category of mechanisms has proven to include the most
likely strategies employed by a limpet to return home following a
foraging excursion. Ability to follow mucous trails has been
demonstrated for many species of gastropods, including C. scabra
(Cook and Cook, 1975; Peters, 1964; Connor, 1984a,b; et al.)
Before a detailed study of the homing mechanism used by C.
scabra could be undertaken, it was necessary to perform a set of
field experiments which would place the homing ability of this
species in its proper context. Populations of C. scabra were

intertidal heights, as well as distance travelled on a foraging
run, and time spent foraging. Furthermore, the paths taken by C.
scabra in its foraging excursions were recorded. Completion of
these observations set the stage for a study of the mechanism(s)
used in the homing ability.
Several researchers have examined the role that cephalic
tentacles play in the homing of gastropods, both in field and
