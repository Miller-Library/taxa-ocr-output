feeding excursions occur at high tide with no apparent
differences in activity between daylight and darkness.
Furthermore, Villee and Groody (1940) report only small
individuals of C. scabra were seen to move at all. However,
these observations, as well as those of Hewatt (1940) and Wells
(1917) were largely restricted to low tide, with high tide
observations being made without the use of snorkel or SCUBA
equipment.
With these extreme differences in activity patterns between
different populations of C. scabra, I found it necessary to
define the times of greatest movement for the population of
limpets used in this study. The sites employed in this study
were characterized by moderate wave action. The zone of
turbulence was present throughout the entire submerged period,
even at the study site lowest in the intertidal region. The
difference in the amount of wave action in different studies, and
hence the amount of time spent in the zone of turbulence, could
account for the differences in the amount of limpet movement at
varying degrees of submergence found in these studies. This
suggests a detailed study of the correlation of limpet movement
with wave action in both the same and geographically isolated
sites to determine the relationship between turbulence and
activity as well as its potential adaptiveness.
This study shows that limpets higher in the intertidal move
more during an awash period than animals lower in the intertidal,
suggesting that time spent submerged is a factor in the amount of
movement seen at different degrees of submergence. In addition,
