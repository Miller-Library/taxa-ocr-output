pattern employed by limpets where the outward trail is not
retraced in the journey home.
TENTACLE REMOVAL IN THE FIELD
After allowing sufficient time for the limpets to return to
their home sites (one period of submergence), limpets were
classified as: 1) home -- on its home site and oriented properly,
2) not home -- away from the home site or not oriented properly,
or 3) missing -- not found within reasonable distance of the
study area. Results from this field experiment are presented in
table I. It is evident from this table that no significant
differences in homing ability were found to exist between control
limpets and those with excised tentacles.
Observations of the movement patterns of these two groups
were made on four subsequent daytime high tides and no
substantial differences were seen in numbers of limpets moving,
average distance travelled, and average foraging time of the two
groups.
TRAIL FOLLOWING IN THE TIDE-TANK
Activity patterns of limpets placed in the tide-tank
described above were consistent with those displayed in figure 1
(a-d).
The results of the trail following experiments were analyzed
using a Chi square test comparing observed results to 503
expectation for trail following vs. trail crossing (i.e., if
trails had no effect, half of the limpets would follow the
trails, and half would cross it). Of those limpets which
followed the trail, frequency of trail following toward the
