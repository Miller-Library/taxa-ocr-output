with larger limpets being located in the higher intertidal region
(see fig. 2), the size of a limpets could also be playing a role
in the different amounts of movement observed during submerged
periods. Tidal location, wave exposure of the site, and limpet
size may all play a role in a limpet's activity patterns.
The differences in nighttime movement seen in these studies

limpets are already more active at Cabrillo Point than at
Catalina and thus experience less pressure to be actively feeding
at night. However, the amount of movement a limpet is required
to undertake for its survival at a given location depends on the
type of food, its abundance and the population density, as well
as the growth rates of individuals and their reproductive
potential. Another explanation is the differences in the types
of predators found at different sites. Wells (1980) examined the
effects of octopus, a nocturnal predator of limpets, on activity
patterns of C. scabra. The lack of nighttime movement of C.
scabra recorded by Wells could be due to effects of predation by

predation by octopus is a rarity at best, and is certainly not
common enough to affect activity patterns of C. scabra found at
this site. A site or geographic difference in the basic foraging
behavior of a limpet with a predator's presence brings up the
interesting question of genetic versus learned determination.
Studies on this could give ecologists new perspective on species
interactions important in population dynamics.
The paths a limpet follow in a given foraging run can be
