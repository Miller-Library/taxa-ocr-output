detect the directional component of the trail. She describes C.
scabra touching alternate sides of a trail with its tentacles as
it progresses along it.
Two studies were undertaken using C. scabra in order to
examine the role of the cephalic tentacles in the homing ability
of this species. First, a field study was performed to resolve
some of the conflict as to whether C. scabra is able to home
after excision of its cephalic tentacles, and second, a trailÂ¬
following experiment was conducted to determine the role of
cephalic tentacles in this type of homing ability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ACTIVITY PATTERNS
Observation of the movements of Collisella scabra were made
at 15 minute intervals over a 24-hour period at Cabrillo Point,
Pacific Grove on May 30, 1990. Three relatively flat study sites
were chosen along a transect at .83 m, .98 m, and 1.29 m above
MLLW. Snorkel equipment was used to observe movement during
periods of submergence. The shell length of individual limpets
was first measured along the line of greatest distance and then
their home sites were marked using Wet N' Wild nail color with
one mark placed on the anterior portion of the shell and a
corresponding mark placed adjacent to the home site. Clear
acetate sheets were then placed over the 1 m study sites and a
