transparencies denoting the position of the home site facilitated
observations which required distinguishing those limpets which

activity, 25 individuals in each study site were chosen at random
from the group of motile animals; the time spent foraging and the
maximum distance travelled by each of these limpets were
recorded.
These transparencies were also used to record the paths
taken on foraging runs. At 15 minute intervals, the position of
a given limpet was marked on the transparency using a lead
pencil.
TAGGING
Individuals which were used in the tentacle removal needed
an identifying mark so that they could be replaced adjacent to
the correct home site. Limpets were identified using a system of
different colored dots to represent Roman numerals: Green - 1;
blue - V; Orange - X. These markings remained up to 6 weeks.
Home sites were identified using transparencies in the manner
described above.
TENTACLE REMOVAL IN THE FIELD
In removing the cephalic tentacles, I strayed from the
methods of previous researchers and found that an ounce of
patience was worth a liter of solution of Mgcl, isotonic to
