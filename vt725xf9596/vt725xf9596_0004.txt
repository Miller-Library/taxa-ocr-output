laboratory situations. The cephalic tentacles of gastropods are
a tactile and an olfactory organ (Peters, 1964), and may be of
great importance in the trail-following ability of C. scabra.
Field experiments involving the removal of cephalic
tentacles have yielded conflicting results. Davis (1895) removed
the tentacles from 2 individuals and displaced them 5-6 cm from
their home site -- these animals returned to their home site and
Davis concluded that tentacles are not indispensable to the
homing ability of C. scabra. However, Jessee (1968) removed
limpets from their home sites, anesthetized them with magnesium
chloride and left them in an aquarium for 3 days to recover
before similar displacement. Most of the limpets in this study
did not return home and those that did may have relied on an
alternate mechanism since directionality in mucous trails is only
present for 48 hours (Connor, 1984b). Using a mucous trail to
return home requires that the limpet not only be able to detect
the mucous trail, but also to distinguish its trail from others
and to determine the directionality of the trail.
Experimental manipulations of gastropods have been the key
factor in demonstrating the ability of these organisms to follow
mucous trails, and are the only studies which have demonstrated a

handful of studies have examined the role of the cephalic
tentacles in trail-following experiments. Peters (1964) reports
that Littorina planaxis requires its cephalic tentacles to detect
mucous trails at all. Behavioral observations by Connor (1984b)
suggest that Collisella scabra uses its cephalic tentacles to
