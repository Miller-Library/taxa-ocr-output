ABSTRACT
A study of the activity patterns of Collisella scabra showed
that the most prevalent movement occurred during periods of
submergence with no difference between daylight and darkness.
Furthermore, studies showed that cephalic tentacles are not
essential to the homing ability of this species, but they do play
a role in the ability to detect the directionality of mucous
trails.
