Materials and Methods
Phytoplankton for experiments were collected between 8:00 am
and 11:00 am in 10" phytoplankton nets 425 towed behind a
row boat at a depth of 15-20 meters. The collections were made
about 102 meters from the shore of Mussel Point of the Hopkins
Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. Tows were made for
times from 10 minutes to one hour and placed in one pint mason
jars and kept in the dark in an ice filled styrofoam ice bucket during
subsequent tows and until use. These tows were diluted for use
or cultured as described in appendix. Each day samples of the
tows were taken and identified. Dry weight determinations were
made of cultures used in each experiment (Parson and Strickland,
1968).
C1 labelled DDT in ethanol (100 ppm, specific activity
19 mcmM) was micro-pipetted into a 50-100 ml millipore filtered
(0.45) sea water and aliquots from this stock were innoculated
into the cultures. The solution was always drawn up into the
pipette and flushed back into the bottle to assure that the
first aliquot did not lose more DDT through adsorption to glass
than subsequent aliquots..
Cells were killed for Experiments 1 and 2 and 4 with several
drops of Lugol's fixative.
Cells for Experiments 3 and 4 were killed with 2-3 ml of
56 formalin.
The dark tests in Experiments 5 and 6 were carried out in B.O.D.
bottles masked with two layers of plastic electrician's tape
and then wrapped in aluminum foil.
