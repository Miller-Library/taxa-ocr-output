Discussion
The results are confusing with regard to the difference
between Lugol killed and formalin killed cells. It does not
clarify whether uptake is active or passive. Uptake is thought
to be dependent on lipid concentration which is 6% dry weight in
mixed plankton (Parsons and Strickland, 1968). Perhaps the Lugol
solution attacks and alters the lipid in the cell. This is
suggested by the fact that Lodine, which is a constituent of
Bone tCstto es,
Lugol's oxidizes the unsaturated double bonds and this may alter
the fat content, whereas formalin probably does not affect the
lipid.
SÃ¶dergren, in his study of C1pDr uptake by Chlorella,
found that uptake in batch cultures by live cells and by cells
killed with mercuric chloride is the same. This corresponds to
the experiments with formalin killed cells.
Wuster found that photosynthetic inhibition in a given
solution concentration depends on cell density. These results
are consistent with findings here that less dense cultures
concentrate DDT more than dense cultures.
The dry weight concentrations demonstrated by these
phytoplankton suggest that this uptake would be of ecological
significance especially as concentration factors are higher in
low density low concentration situations which are present in the
oceans. On a wet weight basis (assuming 1% of wet weight is
dry weight) these figures suggest that a 10 fold concentration
of DDT is possible in dilute conditions. Concentrations of this
magnitude would be of ecological significance for the food web as
vast quantities of phytoplankton are consumed by herbevores
