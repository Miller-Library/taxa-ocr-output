phytoplankton used which was cultured. Perhaps these cells were
unhealthy in the cultures. Table IV, experiment 4, however, com-
paring alive Lugol preservative killed, and formalin killed cells
of a fresh tow showed that the Lugol's again took up considerably
less DDT than the other two which were approximately the same.
The values of table IV are given as dpm in 0.5 ml pellet. From
this it was assumed that experiment 3 was valid.
Experiment 5, Table V, and experiment 6, Table VI, compare
uptake of CDDT by cells incubated in the light and in the dark,
the former in 0.3 ppb and the latter in 1.2 ppb DDT solution.
The data in the four columns under the headings is arranged
as follows: "Sup" is the dpm of 2 ml supernate. "Pel"is the dpm
of the pellet in a volume of supernate denoted below it. "Cor"
is the corrected value of the pellet. The counts of a volume of
supernate volume equal to that of the pellet is subtracted to
give counts in the pellet. The "Ã¸" is the percentage of DDT taken
from solution by the plankton. It is determined from the ratio of
the corrected pellet count to the total count (5 x supernate count
plus the corrected pellet count).
The dpm are proportional to the amount of DDT in the cells and
conversions have been made for final concentrations in the cells.
These are compared to the initial solution concentrations by the con-
centration factor.
This data is presented in figure 3.
Experiments 5 and 6 indicate that uptake was not related to
the photosynthetic process which it inhibits. The initial concen-
trations for these experiments were determined by taking a reading
