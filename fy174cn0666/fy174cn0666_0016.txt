which could further concentrate the substance.
Certainly many more of the factors determining the uptake
are yet to be determined. Such tests would include examination
of adsorption to silicious shells of diatoms without soft
parts, and tests with metabolic poisons to determine if uptake
is dependent on metabolic activity. Sodergren found that con-
tinuous culture methods (Meyers and Clark, 1944) are much more
reliable than batch cultures to measure uptake as batch cultures
are rarely consistent in many of the parameters which determine
algal activity.
