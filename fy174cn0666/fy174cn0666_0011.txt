These experiments suggested that uptake may be involved with
the life processes of the cells.
Experiment 3, Table III compares the uptake of C DDT by form-
alin kelled and untreated cells. The first column indicates the
slapsed time from the introduction of C DDT. The second column is
the dpm in 2 ml of water control which is the same volume of fil-
tered sea water as volume of the cultures being tested. The in-
itial concentration and codistillation data are determined from
this control.
The other data under four colums are as follows. "Pel" is
the dom of the pellet in a volume of supernate denoted below. The
colum labelled "Sup" is the dpm of 2 ml of supernate. The colum
under "Cor" is the corrected value of the pellet. The counts of
a volume of supenate equal to that of the pellet is subtracted
from the pellet counts to give a corrected pellet count. The column
under "ø" is the percent of DDT in solution taken up by the plank-
ton. The total counts are determined by multiplying the supernate
counts by 5 and adding the corrected pellet count.
The dpm is proportional to the amount of DDT in the cells and
conversions have been made below the table for final concentra¬
tions in the cells. These are compared tothe initial solution con-
centration by the concentration factor.
This data is presented in figure 2
The counts of this experiment were well above background.
They showed that live and formalin killed cells took up the DDT
approximately in the same amounts. A concentration factor of 1.3 x
10 was found. This suggested that the life processes were not in-
volved. Examination of the appendix shows that this is the only
