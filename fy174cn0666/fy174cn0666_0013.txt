of the stock solution and calculated from this according to di-
lution. The actual values may have been below thecalculated values
because of adsorbtion to glass. Experiment 5 had counts which were
close to background and were therefore less accurate than those of
experiment 6 which shows high counts. These cells show concentration
factors of 10 and 10 on a dry weight basis.
Experiment 7, Table VII, compares the uptake of plankton in-
cubated in C DDT at concentrations of 50 ppb and 100ppb. These are
the concentrations wheih Wurster found to inhibit photosynthesis.
The data in the four columns under the headings is arranged
as denoted below: "Pel" is the dpm of the pellet."Sup" is the dpm
of 2 ml of supernate. "Cor" is the corrected walue of the pellet.
is the percentage of DDT taken from the solution by the cells.
The plankton concentrated theDDT on the order of 2,000 times on a
dry weight basis giving concentratinns in the cells of between
100ppm and 200 ppn.
Experiment 8, Table VIII, investigates the retention of DDI
by cells placed in a CHDT reduced environment.
The second column of Table VIII shows the percentage of orig.
inal counts retained in the cells after the elapsed time im the
clean environment.
This experiment showed that 70% to 90% of the DDT taken up
remained in the cells when placed in a radioactive environment con-
taining 1/20th of the concentration (9.5 out of 10 ml were changed).
The retention may actuallty have been a little higher as probably
some cells were lost in the centrifuge process.
