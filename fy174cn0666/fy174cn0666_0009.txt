Tahle I gives data for comparison of c' por uptake by Lugol
presergative killed and untreated cells. The initial solution con-
centration is calculated from the dpm of 2 ml of the water con-
trol blank whith is 0.45u millipore filtered sea water of an equal
volume as the test cultures.
Column Felapsed time" indicates the elapsed time from the in-
troduction of C DDT. Under each heading, the dpm of 0;5ml contain-
ing the pellet is listed in pairs and the next column gives the
average of the two. Further information is listed below the table.
The amount of DOT is proportional to the dpm and final uptake
figures are calculated. A concentration factor is determined com-
paring the initial solution concentration to the final phyto-
plankton concentration.
This data is also presented in fugure 1.
The results of this experiment suggested that live cells take
up between six and seven times as much DDT as Lugol preservative
killed cells. However, the fact that the highest value was only
three times the background count suggested that the results were
not definitive. The loss of 504 of the DDT through codistillation
did not reduce the counts of the live cells which suggested that
once DDT is taken up, it remained bound. As some counts were more
than double that of their duplicate, the figures can not be taken
to be anv more accurate than a factor of two.
