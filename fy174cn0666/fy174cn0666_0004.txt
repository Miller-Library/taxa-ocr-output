has conducted studies of C labelled DDT uptake by chlorella
but no studiesehaveubeen made on natural populations of phytoplankton.
The major question to be investigated is whether uptake is
active or passive, as this is very important especially in
consideration of the effects on the food chain. Accumulation
of substances by living phytoplankton is essentially a process of
absorption by metabolic processes, and adsorbtion by physical
and ion exchange phenomena. Death may increase or decrease uptake
as death may open more sights for uptake and does not necessarily
measure only adsorbtion (Cushing, 1968). Uptake of some radionuclides
shows light and temperature dependence (Gutknect, 1958). Mac
Isacc and Dugsdale, (1967) studied the kinetics of nitrate and
ammonia uptake by natural populations of marine phytoplankton
and suggest that it follows a Michaelis-Menton expression for
enzyme reactions. To test whether uptake is dependent on active
transport, metabolic poisons can be useditoestop metabolically linked
transport while diffusion uptake can continue. (Giese, 1968) Methods
are suggested by Wedemeyer (1965) to distinguish between adsorption
and absortion, and kinetics for diffusion and facilitated
diffusion uptake.
The tests conducted for this project were comparisons of
uptake by live cells and cells killed with Lugol fixative solution,
by live cells and cells killed with formalin, and by cells
exposed to light and cells kept in the dark. These tests are
only preliminary to the investigation of uptake and many experiments
need to be carried out for a fuller understanding of the problem.
There are many problems in investigations of DDT uptake
by plankton. Codistillation of DDT and H20 (Bowman, 1964)
