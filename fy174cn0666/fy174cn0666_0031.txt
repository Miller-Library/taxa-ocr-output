Figure 3.
Comparison of C14DDT Uptake by
Cells Incubated in Light and Dark.
Figure 3 shows data from Tables VIII and IX. Points correspond
to dpm of cells incubated in 1.2 ppb for 13 hours and 0.3 ppb for
3 hours. The amount of DDT in the cells is proportional to the
dpm. The final concentrations of DDT in the cells on a dry
weight basis is 2 ppm for 0.3 ppb and 4 ppm for 1.2 ppb.
