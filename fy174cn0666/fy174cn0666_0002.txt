Abstract.
cpor uptake by populations of mixed phytoplankton are in-
vestigated by centrifugation and liquid scintillation techniques
Plankton in culture densities of 0.03 mg/ml to 0.41 mg/ml in
pDT solutions of 0.3 to 100 ppb show DDT concentrations (gm
DDT gm dry weight plankton) of 210ppb to 170 ppm. Concentration
factors comparing final DDT concentrations in cells with initial
solution concentrations are found between 700 and 13,000. Phyto-
plankton take up between 40 and 70% of the DDT in solution in
less than four hours and generally less than 15 minutes. Formalin
killed cells take up the same amount of DOT as live cells. Lugol
preservative killed cells take up less DOT than live cells.
Cells incubated in dark B.O.D. bottles take up the same amount of
DDT as cells incubated in the light. Less dense cultures con-
centrate DDT more than dense cultures. Plankton appear to con-
centrate DDT moee in dilute DDT solutions than in concentrated
solutions. Phyto plankton containing DDT removed to dilute DDT
solution retained 704 to 90% of their DDT after two hours.
