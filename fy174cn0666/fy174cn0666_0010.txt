Table II from experiment 2 gives data for comparison of
ppr uptake by Lugol preservative killed cells and untreated
cells incubated in a solution of 1.7 ppb DDT. The initial sol-
ution concentration is calculated from the dpm of 2 ml of the water
control blank which is O.45u millipore filtered sea water of an
equal volume as the test cultures.
Column under "elapsed time" indicates the time elapsed
since the introduction of CDDT. Under each heading, the dpm
of 0.5 ml containing the pellet is listed im pairs. The column
"Cor" gives the corrected value of the pellet. The counts of a
volume of supernate aqual to the volume of the pellet is sub-
tracted from the pellet reading. The column "g" is the percent
of the solution (in ten ml - 5 x supernate plus pellet count) that
is found in the pellet.
The amount of DDT is proportional to the dpm and final uptake
figures are calculated. A concentration factor is determined com-
paring initial solutin concentration and final phytoplankton con-
centration.
This data is presented in figure 1.
This experiment gave the same conclusion as experiment 1,
namely that live cells take up more DDT than Lugol preservative
killed cells, by a factor of 20. The results here were much more
reliable as the counts were considerably above background. Even
so, these figues are probably good within a factor of 1.5 - 2.
both experiments showed concentration by live cells of DDT on the
order of 1,000 fold on a dry weight basis.
