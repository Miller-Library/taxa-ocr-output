Culture and Incubation Data
This table providss information concerning collection and use of
of phytoplankton in the experiments. Column one gives experiment number
and a short indication of the nature of the experiment. This column also
provides the date of collection. Column two gives the concentration of
CDDT used in the experiment. Column three indicates mode of collection
The collction labelled "cultured" indicates that a tow was placed in
culture media (follows) and used subsequently. The "Depth" colum indi-
cates the depth at which the collection was made. The "Location"
column indicates location at which collections were made. The buoy re-
ferred to is the bell buoy approximately 1,000 meters off the shore
of Mussell Point of Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California.
The "Age" column gives approximate age of the collection when th experi-
mentwas started. "Treatment" explains how the tow was diluted. The filter-
ed water referred to is filtered with 0.45 millipore filter. "Contain-
er" indicates th vessels used for experimental incubations. "Incubation"
describes the temperature and light conditions of incubation. Foot candle
measuremnts were made with a light meter. The incubator had two
flourescent light bulbs 8 or 10 cm. from the cultures. "Constitution"
indicates theimajor plankton types present in the collection ad identi-
fied by Dr. Isabella Abbott of the Hopkins Marine Station.
