Table IX shows the data for Ã¸live cells, delineates the
experiment number from which they were taken, cell densities,accord-
ing to dry weight, initial solution concentrations, and final con-
centrations in the fells. The concentration factor compares the last
two numbers. "Percent of supernate" shows the amount of DDT taken ur
y the phytoplankton from the solution.
Plankton showed uptake of between 306 and 704 of the DDT in
solution in less than four hours and mostly in less than 15 minutes.
Experiment 6 which was run for 13 hours showedthe greatest percentage
of uptake. Figure 3 showedthe small increase in the amount taken
up after four hours. Comparison of experiments 2,3, and 6 suggested
that concentration factors depended on cell densities with less
dense cultures concentrating DDT more. Experiment 7 suggested that,
very generally, more concentration occurs in less concentrated (DDT)
solutions. The 50 ppb cultures showed a slightly higher concentration
factor than 100 ppb where culture densities were the same. This
dependence on DDT solution concentration is further suggested by
experiment 3 in comparison which experiment 7. Exact relationships
can not be established form this data.
