Introduction
DDT (1,1,1 trichloro-2,2 bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane) is
found to be a wold wide polutant and Rudl (1964) provides a
very excellent general backtround to the problem of pesticides in
ecosystems. This chlorinated hydrocarbon is found in birds of
the Antarctic (Woodwell, 1967) and is found to cause reproductive
failure in sea birds (Hickey and Anderson, 1968) as well as
behavior abnormalities in such animals as the Fiddler crabs
(Odum, Woodsell et. al..,1969). The pesticide is found to be
highly mobile (Risebrough, 11967) and is found to concentrate in
the food web (Woodwell, 1967).
Since marine phytoplankton is the base of this food web,
the effects of DDT on these important plants is important for the
world ecosystem. Butler (-) reports that DDT and other hydrocarbons
such as heptachlor, chlordane, aldrin, and toxaphene decreased
productivity of phytoplankton by 50-90% when incubated in 1 ppm
pesticide for four hours. Ukeles (1963) assesses growth of pure
cultures of marine phytoplankton and finds that some concentrations
in the range of 0.2 - 0.6 ppm retard growth of some species.
Wurster (1968) demonstrated that DDT inhibits photosynthesis and
reduces primary productivity by 50-90% in ranges of 150-100 ppb.
Some natural populations show DDT concentrations of 0.04 ppm
(Woodwell, 1967).
To better understand the effects of DOT on phytoplankton
growth and photosynthesis as well as on the food chain, the
processes involved in DT uptake by plankton need to be studied
and this is the purpose of this research project. SÃ¶dergren (1968)
