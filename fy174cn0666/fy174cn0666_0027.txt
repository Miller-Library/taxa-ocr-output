Comparison of C DDT Uptake
by Lugol killed and Untreated Cells
Figure 1 shows data from Tables IV and V. It shows radioactive
disintegration per minute emitted from samples of untreated (open
point) and Lugol preservative killed cells (solid point). One
set of points corresponds to cells incubated at 0.3 ppb for
4.5 hours, and the other to cells incubated at 1.7 ppb for
2 hours. DDT contained in the cells is proportional to the dpm.
The final point for untreated cells at 1.7 ppb corresponds to
1.5 ppm on a dry weight basis. The final point for the 0.3 ppb
incubation corresponds to 20 ppm on a dry weight basis.
