supernate and replacing it with filtered sea water. These
tubes were then allowed to rest in the water bath for the appropriate
interval and collected in the usual manner.
Calculations of initial solution concentrations were made
either by reading 2 ml of the water blank (Experiments 1 and 3)
or by taking total counts in a 10 ml aliquot (Experiements 5 and 6).
Five times the supernate count is added to the pellet count and
and this total is divided by 10 to get the counts perml which gives
the amount of DDT present. In the case of Experiment 7, the
amount is calculated by the amount added. O.75 ml 50 ppm DDT
in ethanol and 50 100 ppm C14DDT were added to 30 ml H20.
10 ml was added to 100 ml of culture to give 100 ppb and 5 was
added to give 50 ppb.
