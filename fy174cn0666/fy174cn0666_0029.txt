Figure 2
Comparison of C1 Uptake by
Formalin killed and Untreated Cells
Figure 2 shows data from Table VI. It shows radioactive
disintegration per minute emitted from samples of untreated and
formalin killed phytoplankton incubated in 1.2 ppb DDT for two
hours. Two samples of untreated cells (open point) and two of
killed cells (solid point) are shown. Both appear to accumulate
the same amounts of DDT. The amount of DDT in the plankton is
proportional to the dpm. The average final concentration is
16 ppm.
