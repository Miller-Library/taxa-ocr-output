Incubations were made in either incubators with two 30
florescent lights 8-10 cm from the bottles or in a water bath
in a green house where natural light was available.
At appropriate intervals duplicate 10 ml aliquots of
culture were removed by volumetric pipette from cultures and
placed in glass 12 ml centrifuge tubes and rotated 75 cranks by
hand. Two ml samples of supernate were taken and the rest
discarded. 0.2 ml DMF was then added to the 0.3-0.5 ml loosely
packed pellet and poured into a scintillation vial. The tube
was then rinsed with 0.5 ml distilled water which was poured out
the same side of the tube as the pellet to prevent as much loss
of radioactivity as possible. Bray's scintillation fluid was used
for counting (Table X). Separate blanks were made for
supernate and pellet samphes as these count with different
efficiencies. For these blanks, the same procedure as above is
used on plankton from the culture which has not been exposed
to radioactivity. Counts were corrected for background and
pellet counts were corrected by subtracting the count of supernate
of equivalent volume. Concentration of DDT in plankton is
described as grams DDT per gram dry weight phytoplankton. Con-
centration of DOT in water is described as grams DDT per gram
water. Weights of DDT are determined by multiplying disintegrations
per minute by a factor of the specific activity. The factor
used for the experiments (all except Experiment 7) is
8.36 x 10-12 gms DDT/dpm. In Experiment 7 the factor is
62.5 x 10-12 gms DDT/dpm as the radioactivite DDT was diluted
by a factor of 7.5 with cold DDT, also in ethanol.
Tests for retention of DDT were accomplished by taking
10 ml samples of culture, centrifuging, removing 9.5 ml of
