There was bioactivity in all the supernatants, except one,
as well as in the final pellets (Figure #3). There was no
significant difference in the sonicated versus unsonicated
slimes. The biological activity did not decrease
significantly with progressive washes, although the
absorbances in the UV/visible spectra were lower with
progressive washes (Figures #4 and #5).
Dialysis
The retentate showed no bioactivity, while the undialyzed
control produced a strong response from the sea star. The
UV/visible spectrum of the retentate showed that it had
lost much of its absorbance. (Figure #6)
Gel Column Chromatography
The Sephadex G-50 column, eluted with filtered sea water,
separated the slime into two major components with peaks
centered at fractions 23 and 47 (as determined by
UV/visible spectra - see Figure #10). The bioactivity of
these fractions were higher than that of other fractions
(Figure #9). Fraction 47 stained stronger with coomassie
blue than did fraction 23.
