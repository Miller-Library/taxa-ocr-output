with salt plates.
Gel Electrophoresis
Two acrylamide gels were run, a 10-182 gradient gel, and a
123 gel (see Cooper, 1977 for techniques). The gels were
calibrated with both high and low molecular weight
standards (see Figures #11 and #12). On both gels the
experimental lanes consisted of crude supernatant (7,500g
for 10 minutes), and fractions 23 and 47 from the gel
colunn eluted with sea water. The gels were stained with
the silver chloride technique. (Morrissey, 1981)
