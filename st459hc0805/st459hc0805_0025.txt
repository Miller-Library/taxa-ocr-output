ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I want to thank my advisors, Dr. Robert Swezey and Dr.
Charles Baxter. At the start of this project I was a
newcomer to both biochemical techniques and the marine life
at Hopkins Marine Station. Rob taught me the biochemical
technigues and was always around the lab and willing to help
me. And Chuck was an invaluable source for information on
the species I studied as well as other species of the
Monterey Bay. I also want to thank Dennis Larochelle, a
graduate student, who helped me with the laboratory
technigues, and answered the infinite questions which I
asked. Lastly, I have to thank Tom Otis (one of the
Teaching Assistants for the course) who helped collect
hundreds of snails, and my "partner in slime" (as she coined
the term), Christy McDevitt, who was fun to work with, even
when she was seasick.
