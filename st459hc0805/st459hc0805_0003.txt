MATERIALS & METHODS
Bioassays
Bioassays were conducted on the sea star Pycnopodia
helianthiodes. The sea star was placed in a fingerbowl
with 1-2 inches of sea water, and 50 ul of the test
substance was applied to the tip of a small arm (1.5-3
inches). There was a minimum recovery period of 3 minutes
between trials. The reaction was classified on a scale of
O - 3, with O equal to no response, 1 equal to weak
response (closing of arm around tube feet and slight
retraction of arm), 2 equal to a moderate response
(retraction and curling up of arm), and 3 equal to a strong
response (strong curling or retraction of arm - often
coupled with running away from stimulus).
Collection
C. Canaliculatum were collected on the kelp off Cabrillo
Point at Hopkins Marine Station (Pacific Grove,
California). The snails were induced to secrete the yellow
slime in air by placing a tube foot of the P. helianthodes
