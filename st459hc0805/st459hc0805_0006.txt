A 2.5ul sample was applied to a Whatman No. i filter paper,
dried, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 dissolved in 252
isopropanol, 10acetic acid and 65 distilled water for 15
minutes. The stained paper was washed in distilled water
for 10 minutes, and then dried. (Esen, 1978)
Dialysis
The crude slime was centrifuged at 7,500g for 10 minutes
and 1.0 ml of the supernatant (the rest of the sup. Was
kept as a control) was loaded into a dialysis bag (with an
approximate cutoff of 12Kd), which was stirred in 100Oml of
filtered sea water. After 6 hours the bath was poured out
and replaced. This was left overnight and the retentate in
the bag and the control were compared on the UV/visible
spectra, in bioactivity, and in protein concentration.
Gel Column Chromatography
A 40ml Sephadex G-50 column was used and 30 drop fractions
(about 1.7m1 each) were collected. For one experiment
filtered sea water was used as the eluent. The crude
vellow slime was centrifuged at 7500g for 10 minutes and
40Oul of the supernatant were loaded onto the column.
Fractions were then analyzed by UV/visible spectroscopy,
