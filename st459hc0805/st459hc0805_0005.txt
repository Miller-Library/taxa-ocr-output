Heat Stability
Epindorph tubes containing the crude yellow slime were put
in a boiling water bath (98 C). At 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes
tubes were remove and put on ice. Bioassays of serial
dilutions(1, 1/5, 1/25, 1/125) were taken of the tubes
boiled for 5 and 10 minutes and of the original slime
control.
Washing by Centrifugation
Each wash consisted of centrifuging 2.0 ml of the crude
vellow slime at 150,000g for 1 hour (4 C) in a Beckmann
Ultracentrifuge, pipeting off the supernatant, and
resuspending the pellet in 2.0 ml of filtered sea water.
Two series of four washes were done, one started with the
crude slime sonicated for 10 brief (approxinately 1 sec
each) pulses, and one started with unsonicated crude slime
as a control. The four supernatants and the final pellet
(resuspended in 2.0 ml of filtered sea water) were tested
for bioactivity and analyzed were analyzed by the
UV/visible light spectroscopy.
