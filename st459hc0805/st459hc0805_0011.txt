Elution with distilled water separated the slime into 3
components centered at fractions 23, 31, and 50. When
concentrated, fractions 20-27 produced moderate to strong
reactions, fractions 28-40 produced strong reactions, and
fractions 46-54 produced moderate to strong reactions. The
original supernatant produced strong reactions.
Gel Electrophoresis
In both gels run, the lanes loaded with fractions 23 and 47
showed no protein bands, and the lanes with the yellow
sline supernatant showed 2 major protein bands having
molecular weights of approximately 50,000d, and 18,000d
(Figures #11 and #12)
UV and Visible Spectra
Peak absorbances of crude slime were a double peak at
30Onm, and a shoulder at 380-400nm (see control, Figure
46). Peak absorbances for fraction 23 were at 234nm, 260nm,
318nm (Figure #7), and peak absorbances for fraction 47
were at 234nm, 308nm, and 36Onm (Figure #8). The retentate
from the dialysis had a sharp peak at 220-230nm and very
small shoulders around 30Onm and 400nm (Figure #6).
