Solubilities
The yellow pellet was very soluble in ethanol, soluble in
distilled water, slightly soluble in acetone, and insoluble
in ether and benzene. Distilled water with Naoh
precipitated the pellet, and HCl brought it back into
solution. The portion which was dissolved in ethanol
produced a strong response from the sea star when the
residue was transferred into filtered sea water. It had a
spectrum almost identical to the supernatant from the
original centrifuged crude slime (see Figure l and control
on Figure #6). The ph of the slime (as it was collected
crudely in its sea water mixture) was 7.4.
Heat Stability
The tubes which were boiled for 5 and 10 minutes showed no
significant decrease in bioactivity as compared to the
untreated control over the range of dilutions tested. (see
Figure #2)
