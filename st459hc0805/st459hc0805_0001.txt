ABSTRAC
The noxious yellow slime secreted by the marine snail
Calliostoma canaliculatum contains mostly small
constituents (less than 12Kd) that are heat stable and
partially hydrophobic. There are at least two bioactive
fractions in the slime. One has a molecular weight of
approximately 700 - 800 daltons, and the other contains the
characteristic yellow color.
