are observations made on detergent-like properties of it.
The slime seemed to destroy sea urchin egg membranes. No
quantitative analysis of this was performed.
Behavioral observations show that this hydrophobicity may
make sense. The snail has been observed to wrap itself in
its own slime as it secretes it (McDevitt, personal
communication). The slime could better serve its purpose
of deterring the P. helianthoides, because every time the
sea star touched the shell it would sense the slime. The
slime also would be harder to wash away.
The slime is fairly pH neutral (7.4 in sea water). The
fact that it is more soluable in acid than in base
indicates that it might contain a basic functional group
(amino?).
The bioactive molecules are not large proteins. They are
dialyzable ( therefore Â« 12Kd M.W.), heat stable, and do
not appear on an acrylamide gel (possibly running through,
or not staining silver chloride), and are soluble in
precipitate in
proteins
usually
ethanol (large
ethanol) (Cooper, 1977).
All of the bioactive components are smaller than 12,000
daltons as evidenced by the dialysis experiments. Fraction
23 has a molecular weight of 700 - 800d, calculated from
its elution volume on the gel column. (763.53d calculated
- 15.
