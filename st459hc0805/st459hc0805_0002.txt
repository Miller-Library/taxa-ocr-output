INTRODUCTION
The marine snail Calliostoma canaliculatum secretes a
vellow slime as a defense against a sea star predator,
Pycnapodia helianthoides. In response to the noxious slime
P. helianthoides retracts the arm exposed to the slime and
nay move away. Behavioral observations on this interaction
(McDevitt, personal communication) indicate that the slime
release is the final method of defense used by the C.
canaliculatum, after the snail has attempted to flee and
work itself free from the sea star. This indicates that
the slime may be an energy expensive compound to make. The
snail does not need dietary precursors to produce the
slime, which seems to be synthesized di novo and stored for
later secretion(McDevitt, personal communication).
The purpose of this study was to characterize this slime
biochemically and fractionate it, isolating those fractions
with bioactivity. P. helianthoides, was used to test
bioactivity, because it is the natural recipient of the
sline.
