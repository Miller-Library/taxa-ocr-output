Infrared Spectra
Fractions (20-27) (Figure #14) and (28-40) (Figure #15) seem
to have nearly identical infrared spectral profiles. They
both show a broad absorbance centered at 3350 cm-1, a
narrower absorbance at 1660 cm-1, and a small peak at 1150
cm-1. Other peaks at 2900 cm-1, 1460 cm-1, 1380 cm-1, 1020
cm-1, and 720 cm-1 are all artifacts due to Nujol.
