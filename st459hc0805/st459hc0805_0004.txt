on the tentacles of the snails so that they retracted with
the tube foot when prodded with the pipet. This caused the
secretion of sea water, and in most cases the yellow
slime. This crude yellow slime/sea water mixture was
collected and refrigerated in flasks.
Ultraviolet Spectra/isible spectre
Ultraviolet and visible spectra were taken on a Hewlett
Packard 8452A array diode spectrophotometer connected to an
IBM PC. The spectra were then loaded into the Lotus
Worksheet package for analysis and graphing.
Solubilities
The crude yellow slime was centrifuged at 7500g for 10
minutes. The pellet was mixed with a pipet in the test
solvent. Distilled water, distilled water with O.iM HCI,
and distilled water with O.1M NaoH, ethanol, acetone,
ether, and benzene were the test solvents. The ethanol
soluable constituents were tested for bioactivity by freeze
drying the ethanol away and resuspending the dry solids in
filtered sea water (to the original volume of the slime).
