shoulder at 360-400 could be the yellow color absorbance.
The infrared spectra of both fractions do have a carbonyl
peak at 1660 cm-1, but are lacking both the characteristic
carboxylic acid hydroxyl absorbance and the characteristic
amino group absorbance. The peak at 3350 cm-1 shows an
alcohol-like hydroxyl absorbance (Pavia, 1979).
There are data indicating that the slime components block
both sodium and potassium channels at 1/100 dilution of the
crude slime, and that the fractions from the second gel
chromatography column (concentrated fractions 20-27, and
46-54) have separate, different effects. Fractions 20-27
seem to block the sodium current, and fractions 46-54 seem
to block a potassium current of Lolligo opalesceas
chemoreceptor cells (Dr. William Gilly, personal contact).
The slime also seems to block the potassium current in
neurons from the Doriopsila albopunctata (Dr. Stuart
Thompson, personal communication). It is possible that the
compound shares structural characteristics with
tetrodotoxin, or saxotoxin.
