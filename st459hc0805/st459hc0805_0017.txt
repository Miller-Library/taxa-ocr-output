1. There are at least two active components in the slime
as separated by the Sephadex G-50 column.
2. The slime is amphiphilic, showing both hydrophobic and
hydorphilic traits.
3. The active components of the slime are a relatively
small particles. All are less than 12,000d. One bioactive
component has a molecular weight of 700-800d.
4. There is no conclusive data to show whether the active
components are peptides or other other small molecules.
Further Experiments
Further purification of the slime should be attempted.
Fractions from the Sephadex G-50 column could be run on an
ion exchange column to separate the slime according to
charge if it has any. The bioassay should be made more
quantitative. Possibilities include developing
neurological, or sea urchin egg lysis assay. It also might
be possible improve the P. helianthoides assay by attaching
force transducer to an arm of the sea star to measure the
force of arm retraction. Infrared specs should be taken of
more highly purified fractions. The HPLC could be run to
analyze amino acids of acid hydrolyzates, and to analyze
the similarities between the slime and TTX and PSP.
