shorter presence in a biological system) it could be valuable
to consider the ratio of DDE to sDDT. Such a comparison between
DDE and sDDT is presented in Fig. 4. The results show a
definite trend towards lower DDE values away from the Salinas
SDDT
River, a trend seemingly contradictory to the argument developed
above. One would expect a shorter "system time" near a point
source of input. However, since recent usage of DDT in the
area has decreased sharply and the Salinas River has not flooded
in over two years, it is likely that the last significant input
of sDDT (mostly DDT) into the bay (at least from this river)
occurred in Feb., 1969, when the river flooded thousands of
acres of farmland. Since it is now established that the majority
of the sDDT being translocated in such a river is adsorbed
to fine sediment particles rather than sand-sized particles
(Routh, 1971; Lee, 1971) and since the heavier sand particles
have faster sedimentation rates than the finer material, the
majority of sDDT would be washed out into the ocean instead of
settling on the beach (as it would if adsorbed to sand particles).
Current patterns off the mouth of the Salinas River are seasonally
variable, but in general, offshore bottom currents off the
mouth of the river tend to move in a northerly and southerly
direction parallel to the shore (Wolf, 1968). The majority
of sDDT input, having moved out into the bay, would be distrib-
uted throughout the bay by surface and bottom currents, where
longshore currents which run in a northerly and southerly
direction parallel to the southern and northern parts of the
bay respectively before turning seaward just south of the
