might depend totally on the proportion of ovigeroussto non-
ovigerous animals collected from each beach. Hence, if the sand
crab is to be used as an indicator of actual relative levels of
sDDT, only animals at the same reproductive stage should be
used. Since the female Emerita, once she begins to reproduce
continues to lay eggs until the end of the season (usually
about eight months of reproductive activity) it is reasonable
to hypothesize that there might be a continual loss of sDDT
throughout the reproductive season. If this were the case,
only non-reproductive animals should be used as indicators of
SDDT levels, since the length of the reproductive season is
functionally related to environmental parameters (Eickstaedt, 1969)
which are likely to be different at different beaches. In
short, it is highly unlikely that female Emerita at the same
reproductive stage would be collected at two different beaches
at the same time.
While Fig.2 can be considered as representative of naturall
levels of sDDT in populations of Emerita the data from these
samples cannot be used for a systematic comparison between
populations. For example, animals from site 5 have significantly
higher levels than those from any other site. Yet, this may
be due to the fact that all animals from that site were non-
ovigerous. However, Swarbrick (1971) also found high sDDT
levels in that area (Monterey Wharf + 2) when analyzing hermit
crabs (Pagurus samuelis) during the same period. Therefore,
it seems that this graph may,in fact, offer a rough estimation
only of the relative sDDT levels. Clarification of the anomalous
