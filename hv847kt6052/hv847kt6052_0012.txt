Unfortunately,time considerations and lipid cleanup problems
prevented a thorough analysis of all of the egg samples. How-
ever, those that were tested showed a considerable concentration
of sbpT compared to animals they were taken from. However.
egg removal alone does not account for the discrepancy
between non-productive animals and ovigerous ones with eggs
removed (Table 1).
This suggests that ovigerous females have at some point
lost a considerable amount of sDDT. Without further study, one
can only speculate as to the mechanism involved. Since it is
quite unlikely that all of the six non-ovigerous animals tested
(Table i) were non-reproductive (they all had noticeable
ovaries)and some may have just lost their eggs) and there was no
overlap of sDDT values for ovigerous versus non-ovigerous animals.
a rapid but short-lived elimination of the sDDT is suggested. A
plausible time for this to occur would be when the rate of lipid
translocation from the female to the eggs is greatest. If, in
fact, all the non-ovigerous animals were also non-reproductive.
then a more uniform elimination of the sDDT is suggested. It has
been reported that Emerita may build up lipid reserves prior
to the energy-consuming egg laying season, and used them up
during the season (Lee and Gilchrist, 1971; Eickstaedt, 1969).
Because the largest animals, which would tend to store more
lipid, are the first to become reproductive (Eickstaedt, 1969).
this hypothesis seems reasonable. It is doubtful that the
hydrophobic, lipid-soluble sDDT would be lost from the eggs, which
