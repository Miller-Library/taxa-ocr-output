The study reported herein represents an effort to substantiate
the effectiveness of Emerita as an indicator of subtle changes
of sDDT in the littoral marine environment. In order to try to
pinpoint areas of high sDDT levels and possible sources of sDDT
in Monterey Bay, sand crabs were collected from 22 beaches
around the Bay, and analyzed for sDDT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All specimens were collected within a five day period
(April 18-22, 1971) from 23 beaches encompassing the entire.
configuration of Monterey Bay (Fig. 1). Onlyfemale animals
were taken and these were easily determined by size alone
(Eickstaedt, 1969). Ovigerous females had their eggs removed
at the collection site and these were placed in a glass test
tube until analyzed (All glassware used was heated overnight
at 400 C to remove impurities). These eggs were found to be
at about the same stage of development, as determined by
color (Lee and Gilchrist, 1971), which coincided nicely with
Eickstaedt's (1969) findings that the mean developmental
stage of eggs for any given month of the year should be approx-
imately the same for different animals from the same general
area. Whole animals were wrapped in aluminum foil. Burnett
(1971) noticed that smaller specimens of E.analoga tend to
accumulate higher sDDT concentrations than larger animals and
Cox (1971) noticed the same thing in Euphausia pacifica,
a large zooplankter. An attempt was thus made to use only
specimens weighing more than two grams, above which sDDT
levels are not significantly affected by body weight (Burnett.1971).
