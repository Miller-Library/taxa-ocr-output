Salinas River (Wolf, 1968), may recirculate the sDDT, increasing
the relative amounts of DDE all the while. After the 1969 flood,
King (1969) found levels of sDDT in Emerita at the mouth of the
river with higher values for DDT than DDE, which is reasonable,

since extreme local effects would necessarily contaminate the
immediate area with sDDT (adsorbed in part to the fraction of
fine sediments that were not washed out to sea immediately) and
a short "system time" for sDDT to reach the Emerita resulted.
Animals tested from the same site in this study (two years
later) showed considerably higher values for DDE than for DD

It is doubtful that sDDT that has remained in the sediments of
the riverbed over a period of time (and are thus mostly DDE)
contribute a relative significant amount of DDE to the runoff
during a flood, since according to usage figures the vast majority
of sDDT being translocated would be in the form of technical
grade DDT that had been recently applied to agricultural lands
of the watershed.
The trend seen in Fig. 4, therefore, is
not unreasonable.
Of course, it is possible that Fig. 4 merely represents
the effect of differential ecological parameters in different
parts of the bay such as standing crop density, trophic level
interchange (and concommitant differential accumulation of
sDDT). Any pattern that exists may either be coincidental or
directly related to the river runoff.
Since DDE values of ovigerous to non-ovigerous animals
SUDT
differs by only 11% (Table 1), the data presented in Fig.4
needs little qualification.
