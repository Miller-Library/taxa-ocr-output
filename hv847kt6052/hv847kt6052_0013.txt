are exposed to the seawater, via some diffusion mechanism
across the egg membrane. All these hypothesis could be tested
without too much difficulty.
Whether or not Emerita analoga is, in fact, a good
systematic indicator of comparative sDOT levels has not been
fully demonstrated in this study, principally because it was
found that sDDT levels differ markedly between ovigerous and
non-ovigerous animals. This difference could not be attributed
entirely to the amount of sDDT lost in the egas when they were
experimentally removed from the animals. It is therefore
suggested that the pertinent difference occurs between
reproductive and non-reproductive animals rather than between
ovigerous and nen-ovigerous specimens. In order to determine
the effectiveness of Emerita as an indicator species, then,
perhaps only non-reproductive animals should be used. Until
further information is gained concerning the stage of reproduction
in relation to loss of uptake of sDDT the problem must necessarily
remain unresolved.
