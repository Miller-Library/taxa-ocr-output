results results obtained between ovigerous and non-ovigerous
females would allow for an acceptable interpretation.
There seems to be relatively low levels between the Pajaro
and San Lorenzo River (sites 15-22) and at the Salinas River
mouth (site 10, Fig. 2). Since sDDT levels in the sand
samples (Fig. 5) showed peaks at the major drainage outlets
(except the Salinas River which was blocked by a sand bar at the
time of collection), and the aforementioned low sDDT levels
exist at all the drainage outlets, it seems reasonable to
hypothesize that sDDT input must first get into the marine
ecosystem--adherred to particulate matter and/or ingested by
marine plankton-before its presence is revealed in the Emerita,
If, during low runoff periods, most of the sDDT is deposited
on the beach adjacent to the drainage outlet, rather than
dispersed in the ocean (as would occur during a flood), it
is unlikely that the Emerita would accumulate much of it since
they do not actively ingest sand while feeding (Efford, 1965).
Analysis of organic detritus and phytoplankton in the surf
zone would probably offer a better correllation, since the
sand crab's food is comprised of this material, and since bodyÂ¬
weight concentrations of sDDT have been found to be a function
of daily intake of sDDT in many animals (Robinson, 1967).
Examination of Fig.3 shows a fairly good relationship
between the distribution of DDT and DDD, but an erratic trend
for DDE distribution. Since DDE is thought to increase with
time in a biological systim (Cox, 1971) and values for DDE may
SDDT
be an indicator of that time, (lower values corresponing to a
