The actual mean levels of sDDT found at each beach tested
is given be Fig. 2. The highest value was found at Monterey
Wharf + 2,(site 5), which had a significantly higher value than
the next four highest peaks, Asilomar (3), Cannery Row (4).
Zumdoski State Beach (14) and Natural Bridges State Beach (23).
It is interesting to note that Carmel (city) Beach had a level
commensurate with some of those found in Monterey Bay. Big Sur
(BS) also exhibited a level similar to those in the Bay. Seacliff
State Beach (20) had the lowest level, and it should be noted
that that beach had had most of its sand scoured away--a
situation not found at any other beach.
Fig. 3, which illustrates the relative levels of DDT and
its metabolites, DDE and DDD, shows parallel distributions for
DDD and DDT, but an erratic distribution of DDE. For this and
other reasons ratios of DDE to sDDT were calculated (Fig. 4)
and their possible significance considered. It can be seen
that the highest values are found in the region of the Salinas
River (10), Elkhorn Slough (13) and Pajaro River (15).
sDDT levels in the sand samples collected are given in
Fig. 5. Definite peaks exist at the Elkhorn Slough (13), Pajaro
River (15), Manresa State Beach (17) and the San Lorenzo River
(22) areas. A low level at the Salinas River may be due to the
fact that a sand bar blocks the mouth of the river during most
of the year (including the period when the sample was taken
there). These values are particularily vulnerable to exper-
imental error, since only one sample from each beach was analyzed.
