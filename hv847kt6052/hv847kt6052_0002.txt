INTRODUCTION
The presence of p.p'-DDT and its principal metabolites,
p.p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDE (hereafter referred to as sDDT) in the
global ecosystem (Risebrough, et. al., 1967; Woodwell, etl. al.,
1967; Tatton and Ruzicka, 1967), its affinity for and con-
centration in biological systems (Woodwell, et. al., 1967;
Robinson, 1967; West, 1967), and its relative stability within
these systems (Cox, 1971: Risebrough, et. al., 1967; Nash and
Woolson, 1967) has been widely documented. Since DDT tends to
be concentrated by organisms at the upper trophic levels of
a given food web (Rudd, 1964; Woodwell, et. al., 1967; West,
1966), special concern is warranted when considering levels of
sDDT at the bottom of such food webs. Emerita analoga, the
common sand crab of exposed sandy beaches on the West Coast,
is a filter-feeding primary consumer (predominantly) which
has been found to contain a mean sDDT level of 7200 ppb (wet
weight) near a point source of heavy sDDT input into the marine
environment (Burnett, 1971) and up to 252 ppb in an area of
apparently more subtle input, Monterey Bay, California, the
geographical focus of this study (King, 1969). Burnett (1971)
found the sand crab to be a good biological indicator of sDDT
concentrations since: 1.) It is readily available on nearly
all exposed sandy beaches from San Francisco to Ensenada, Mexico.
2.) In a survey of that stretch of coastline he found it to
exhibit marked gradients of sDDT concentrations relative toand
indicating point sources of sDDT input. 3.) It is the main food
source for a variety of marine and maritime organisms. For
example, it represents 90% of food, by volume, of the Barred
