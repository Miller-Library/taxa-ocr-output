Only one of the 145 animals analyzed weighed less than two
grams. Sand samples were obtained by skimming the surface
sand with a test tube at the point of collection. Eggs, animals
and sand were immediately frozen, until needed for analysis.
The wet weight of frozen animals was determined by allowing
each animal to thaw for five minutes, removing excess water and
ice and weighing to the nearest.Ol gram. Individual animals
were digested overnight in a 50% mixture of glacial acetic
acid in perchloric acid. Three extractions with nanograde
hexane removed lipids, pigments and chlorinated hydrocarbons.
An additional cleanup was carried out be running an aliquot
of the hexane (about one ml) through a microcolumn (5 3/4" L. X
7.0-7.5 mm.) of silica gel (60-200 mesh, grade 950) and eluting
with 8 ml of 20-80% mixture of benzene and hexane (both nanograde).
The cleaned sample was either used directly or concentrated
under reduced pressure, if necessary.
A Beckman GC 4 gas-liquid chromatograph with an electron
capture detector was used for all analysis. DDT and all its
detectable congeners were determined using a mixed 62 OFi.
5% DC200 cloumn on 80-100 mesh chromosorb W (acid washed and
DMCS treated).
Wet wet weight of eggs was determined by allowing the
frozen seawater around the eggs to melt, removing eggs and
weighing them immediately. Cleanup was with silica gel mixed
with nuchar-attaclay mixture (K-3213, Kensco, Oakland, California).
Otherwise, the procedure was as described above. Sand samples
were automatically shaken with hexane (nanograde) for 20
hours and cleanup was the same as with the whole animals.
