Perhaps the most significant data obtained is presented
in Table 1. Cox (1971) suggested that a possibly significant
amount of sDDT might be lost through the gonads of the particular
organsim he was studying (Euphausia pacifica). Unfortunately,
all collections and analysis were already completed before
this hypothesis was tested in Emerita analoga. It is obvious
from the table, that ovigerous females that had their eggs
removed contained significantly lower levels of sDDT than the
non-ovigerous animals. The eggs that were removed were analyzed
and it was determined that although they had higher levels of
SDDT than did the whole animals from which they were removed,
this did not make up for the large discrepancy. Values for
DDE were found to vary by only 118 in the two groups. It

can be seen that DDE seems to be disproportionately accumulated
in the eggs, relative to both ovigerous and non-ovigerous female
Emerita.
DISCUSSION
After all collections and analysis had been made it was
discovered that ovigerous specimens contained significantly
lower levels of sDDT than non-ovigerous females (Table 1).
While this, in itself is very interesting, it also means that
most of the sDDT data that was collected must be qualified.
The fact that eggs were removed at the collection sites and
ovigerous females with eggs removed were not marked or seperated
from non-ovigerous females introduces a possibly significant
error in the results. Essentially, different beaches may
contain different levels of sDDT, but the results of any analysis
