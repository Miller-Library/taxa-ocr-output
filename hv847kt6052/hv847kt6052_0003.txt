Monterey Bay is the focus of drainage for three rivers
draining an area in excess of 6000 square miles. The Salinas
River with a drainage of 43000square miles, covering essentially
the entire basin of the agriculturally rich Salinas Valley
and having an annual average flow of 320,000 acre feet, is by
far the largest surface water input into the bay. The Pajaro
River (1400 square miles, 120,000 acre feet) also drains a large
agricultural area. The San Lorenzo River, with a drainage
area of only 140 square miles drains a predominantly non-
agricultural, mountainous area, but nevertheless yields 106,000
acre feet per year. (Yancey, 1968).
Although air transport of sDDT-ladened dust particles has
been reported to be the greatest input source of these particular
chlorinated hydrocarbons into the pelagic marine environment
(Risebrough, et. al., 1968), input into littoral and estuarine
waters is influenced most by surface runoff as evidenced by
substantially higher residue concentrations found along inhabited
coastlines as compared to those found in the open ocean. Since
DDT usage in Monterey County (encompassing the Salinas Valley)
alone averaged about 125,000 pounds per year during the period
1959-1969 (Scott, 1969) and as per acre agricultural usage of
DDT does not differ markedly over the watershed being considered,
the Salinas River is clearly the main source of sDDT input into
the bay.
