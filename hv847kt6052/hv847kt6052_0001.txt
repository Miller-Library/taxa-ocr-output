In an effort to determine the effectiveness of the sand
crab, Emerita analoga, as an indicator species of DDT levels
in the California coastal marine environment, specimens were
collected from different beaches on Monterey Bay and analyzed
using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). After all initial
samples were analyed, it was found that ovigerous animals
contained much lower levels of DDT than non-ovigerous animals.
Since the bulk of the samples from the different beaches had
differing proportions of ovigerous to non-ovigerous animals.
and this difference was not recorded, the effectiveness of this
species as an indicator of DDT was not fully demonstrated.
However, the specimens collected do represent natural populations
from the various beaches, and a rough comparison is possible.
Since DDE is reported to increase with time in a biological
system, the relative amount of DDE to the total residues of DDT
was determined for each beach and the data was analyzed for
possible trends. Sand samples were also collected at each beach
when the Emerita were collected, and comparison of DDT levels
in the sand with those in the animals was made.
