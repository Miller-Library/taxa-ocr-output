SUMMAR
Based on lab and field observations, the following ten
1)
animals were observed feeding on ascidians: fissurellid
gastropods; Diodora aspera, Megatebennus bimaculatus, and
Megathura crenulata; other prosobranchs; Calliostoma
ligatum, Erato vitellina, Lamellaria diegoensis, and
Trivia solandri; the opisthobranch Hermissenda
crassicornis; the bat star Patiria miniata; and the
polyclad flatworm Eurylepta californica.
A point system was applied to feeding observations to
obtain a correlation between tunicate species and
predator preferences.
The three most abundant species of tunicates in the
field, Aplidium californicum, Clavelina huntsmani, and
Archidistoma psammion, were found to be the three most
predated tunicates in lab.
The less common predator species Erato, Lamellaria and
Trivia appear to specialize on one or two tunicate
species, Hermissenda, Patiria and Megathura are
more general in their choices, eating a variety of
seven or more ascidian species.
The fissurellid gastropods, Lamellaria and the bat star
eat both tunic and zooids. The other prosobranch gastro-
pods, opisthobranch and polyclad flatworm eat only the
zooids.
