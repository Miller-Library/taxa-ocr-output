the exact mechanism of feeding. Gouging bite marks left
in tunicates fed to Megathura and Megatebennus suggests
that the mouth is applied to the tunicate surface, jaws
agape, while the radula rasps up masses of tunicate tissue,
While the exact mechanism used by Calliostoma ligatum
was not directly observed, it seems feasible that the
mechanism would be similar to the feeding behavior of
Calliostoma annulatum observed by Perron (1975). C. ligatum
crawls across the tunicate surface, tasting the surface with
its mouth and tentacles. It raises its head with the mouth
open and in a sudden jabbing motion, lunges at its prey,
Its mouth attaches to the prey and the head rocks up and
down as the tunicate zooid is drawn into the mouth.
The feeding mechanism of Hermissenda crassicornis is
well described by Yarnall (1972). The rocking action of the
buccal sac as it pumps, sucking up the zooids, is accompanied
by a jerking movement of the ceratae from a relaxed, exÂ¬
tended position to a position lieing flat against the body,
The feeding method of Lamellaria diegoensis is
described by Fretter and Graham (1962) and Lambert (1980).
The mantle covering the shell of Lamellaria spreads out over
the periphery of the animal, concealing the actions of the
mouth. In order to determine feeding, the animal had to
be removed and the tunicate inspected for signs of predation
(hole in tunic).

and Erato vitellina, and the bat star Patiria miniata is
