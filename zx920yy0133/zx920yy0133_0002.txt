METHODS
The survey began with field observations in the inter-
tidal of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. Signs of
predation such as digested tunicate, missing zooids or
actual feeding behavior by predator suspects were noted.
Predator suspect is defined as a specimen of a recorded
predator, a relative of a recorded predator or any animal
associated with and suspected of eating tunicates.
Field observations, noting predator species, type
of tunicate and source of association (on or eating tunicate).
continued throughout the survey. Observations were made at
various times and tides in different areas throughout the
intertidal and subtidal of Hopkins Marine Station (HMS),
Eighteen species of predator suspects were brought into
the laboratory for feeding observations. All specimens were
collected from the intertidal or subtidal of HMS.
All animals except Megathura crenulata were kept in
wire mesh cages or plastic tubs with fresh running sea water.
The animals were maintained under natural day and night light
only. Artificial light was eliminated as a preliminary class
study showed that some animals would not feed in bright artiÂ¬
ficial light. Some species are noted to be inhibited by light
altogether (Lambert, 1980). A red light created by using
a dive light covered with a red plastic sheet provided light
to aid in night observations. Specimens of Megathura were
kept in an outside tank with running sea water and, thus,
were exposed to natural day and night light also. Animals
