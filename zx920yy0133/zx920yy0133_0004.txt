RESULT
The laboratory feeding observations are summarized in
tables 1-5. The observations of feeding on each tunicate
species are summed up for all individual specimens of each
predator species. Therefore, the feeding patterns of indi¬
vidual predator specimens are not included.
Some predators show a strong association with one
prey species. Aplidium californicum was the only ascidian
species that Trivia solandri had been observed eating and
Eurylepta californica ate only Clavelina huntsmani.
Although other tunicate species were eaten, Patiria
miniata ate mostly Ascidia ceratodes and Clavelina. Three
fissurellid prosobranchs were found to eat a variety of
ascidians. Megatebennus bimaculatus was found stronly
associated with tunicate prey in both lab and field obser¬
vations. Megathura spent the majority of observations on
Archidistoma psammion and ate the greatest diversity of
ascidians.
Some predator species exhibited behavior difficult to
interpretsuch as Hermissenda crassicornis who foraged un¬
successfully on A. californicum for a large portion of the
observations, yet spent less than half the number of
observations successfully feeding on Clavelina. Calliostoma
ligatum was never seen successfully eating A. psammion, but
seemed to spend most of its time trying to eat it.
Both specimens of Lamellaria diegoensis ate Cystodytes
lobatus in the laboratory. Both were found on Cystodytes
