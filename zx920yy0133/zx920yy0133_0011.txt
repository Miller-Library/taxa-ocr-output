more investigation especially in the field. In lab Megathura
was found to eat the greatest number of tunicates, a total
of 14 species. Despite the lack of feeding observations,
they do eat ascidians in the field as the gut analysis shows.
These large animals are known to occur in abundance and may
prove to be a profitable predator for further study.
Megatebennus was primarily found in areas of high surge
where water was well ciculated or was brought in to lab with
subtidal tunicate specimens. It was found mostly on
A. californicum and in addition, often resembled the color of
the tunicate with which it was associated. All the ascidians
which it ate in lab occur in intertidal areas of high surge.
Many of the animals in sea water tables became sick unless
a hose was positioned with its excurrent flowing directly
through the cage. This suggests that Megatebennus prefers
a habitat with a high turnover of water. Perhaps this in¬
formation will be useful in locating specimens in later studies.
It would be best to obtain data on tunicate predators
from actual field observations; however, it was difficult to
observe many instances of feeding in the field. (figure 4)
In collecting data in the laboratory, 184 hours were spent
observing suspected predators and potential prey. This
yielded 147 observations of actual feeding. In contrast,
80 hours were spent looking for predation in the field and
only 15 feeding observations were made.
Perhaps predators have their most significant impact
during larval stages or on newly settled and young adult stages.
