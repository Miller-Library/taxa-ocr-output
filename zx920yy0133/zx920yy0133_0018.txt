Tables 1-5 Summary of data from lab observations.
All observations were scored in the following manner:
+ -- Predator was
observed feeding successfully
on tunicate species. Success was determined by
actually seeing the zooid or tunicate material
pass into the predator or by strong evidence
such as missing zooids or digested tunic.
o/+ -- Observed feeding behavior, but found no evidence
for success.
o -- Predator observed sitting or crawling on tunicate,
but no feeding activity was observed.
blank space -- Predator was not observed on the
tunicate species.
The number of scored observations for each tunicate
species was summed for each predator species.
The success rate of feeding was determined by
number of  observations
% success
number of + observations plus
-number of o/+ observations
Hermissenda crassicornis was the only predator to have
a success rate other than 100% or 0%. Therefore, the
success rate column (%) is shown for this predator only
in table 1.
