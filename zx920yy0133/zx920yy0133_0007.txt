Bow, 1981
described in Abbott and Haderlie (1980).
Eurvlepta californica is often found wrapped over the
siphons of Clavelina. When it eats, the mouth and pharynx
extend down through one of the siphons
and
sucks in the zooid. As the flatworm's mouth and pharynx
extend deeper into the tunic, the central part of the body
folds into the tunic through the siphon. The pharynx and
gut of the zooid are ingested by the flatworm.
