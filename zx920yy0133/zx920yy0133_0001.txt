INTRODUCTION
Information on predation of ascidians is scant and
can be found either in studies on the biology of an individual
predator (McDonald and Nybakken, 1980; Perron, 1975; Sellers,
1977; Yarnall, 1972) or in anedotal observations of preÂ¬
dation ontunicates (Ching, 1977; Gulliksen and Skjeveland,
1973; Lambert, 1980). Abbott and Newberry (1980) offers
the most current collection of tunicate predator information,
Here the sea stars Patiria miniata, Dermasterias imbricata,
Pteraster tesselatus, Asterias rubens,
Mediaster aequalis,
Orthasterias koehleri and Solaster stimpsoni are cited as
predators of particular ascidians (not neccessarily in
Monterey Bay) along with the nudibranch Hermissenda crassicornis.
Millar (1971) lists fish; crabs; the prosobranchs Erato voluta,
Lamellariaceangand Cypraeceans; opisthobranchs Pleurobranchus
membranaceus and various nudibranchs; turbellarian flatworms
and seals as observed predators other than man.
My goal was to obtain a survey of possible ascidian
predators here in the Monterey Bay area, specifically Pacific
Grove. At the same time I hoped to gain general information
about predator-ascidian relationships like feeding behavior,
tunicate response and damage.
