colonies of matching color (white specimen on white colony and
orange specimen on orange colony).
Gut analysis of Calliostoma specimens collected subÂ¬
tidally from the kelp beds of HMS revealed sand, sponge
spicules and detritus, but lacked identifiable tunicate
remains. Gut analysis of Megathura, taken subtidally from
Lover's Point, Pacific Grove, California, yielded whole
orange zooids, a partially digested lobe of Aplidium arenatum
and whole Perophora annectens zooids amongst sponge spicules,
spirorbis, algal fragments, bryozoans, diatoms, detritus
and sand.
Feeding Observations:
With the exception of a polyclad flatworm, Eurylepta
californica, and the bat star Patiria miniata, the other
predators found were eight species of gastropods, three of
which are keyhole limpets. These three are Diodora aspera,
Megatebennus bimaculatus, and Megathura crenulata and they
eat both the zooids and the tunic. Diodora uses the outer
lips of the mouth to form a suction that pulls the prey up
to open jaws. The radula makes one or two strokes, tearing
off tissue. Then the jaws close, cutting off any threads
hanging from the radula.
Megathura and Megatebennus probably eat in a somewhat
similar fashion. The mantle of these two limpets covers the
head region of the animal, making it difficult to follow
