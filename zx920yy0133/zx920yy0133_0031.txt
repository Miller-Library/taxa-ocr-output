employed to score observations made in the field.
Double symbols, o, +, +, indicate observations
that were seen in the field but not in the lab.
+ -- observed successful feeding
qy+ -- observed feeding behavior but success undetermined
undetermined
o -- predator observed on tunicate but no feeding
activity exhibited
Blank spaces mean that no interaction was observed
between the predator and tunicate species.
