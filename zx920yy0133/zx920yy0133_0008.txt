To try and get the closest correlation of tunicate
predators with their preferred prey species, a point system
was employed which included not only successful feeding
observations, but also the attempts at feeding where success
could not be determined, along with observations of association
of the predator with tunicate species. By giving each type
of observation a weighted numerical value based on the
assumption that a predator eats more of, or associates more
with, its preferred food, each tunicate species receives a
number that represents the predator's preference for that
species. (figure 1)
All tunicates that were ranked most preferred had been
successfully preyed upon by their prospective predators.
whereas only half of the second and third most preferred
tunicates were successfully eaten. The result that all of
the most preferred tunicates were successfully eaten may be
taken as a positive indication of the appropriateness of
the point system in ranking preferences. The quick drop
in positive correlation for the second and third choices
may be explained by: 1) The occurance of specialized predaÂ¬
tors that eat only one or two tunicate species. 2) Sometimes
a predator specimen spent a significant amount of observation
time sitting on a tunicate, using it as a substrate and not
trying to eat it. 3) In some cases active feeding behavior
was repeatedly observed on the same prey species without
