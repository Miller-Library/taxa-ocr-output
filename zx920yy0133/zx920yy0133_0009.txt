observed success. This may be due to a zooid-escape response
or the predator may be grazing material on the tunic surface,
Predators like Hermissenda and Calliostoma who eat
only the zooids may be unsuccessful in feeding attempts
because the zooids contract down into the protection of the
tunic when disturbed by predator foraging. This same con¬
traction-escape response can be elicited by poking or
rubbing the tunic surface with a dissecting probe,
Predators such as Megathura, Megatebennus and Patiria
that eat both the zooid and tunic were observed either eating
or not eating which resulted in scored feeding rates of
100% success. (tables 2 and 5). Even though the zooids are
withdrawn, the tunic-plus-zooid-eaters are usually success¬
ful as they eat right through the tunic until the zooids are
available for feeding.
Sand encrusted tunicates such as Synoicum parfustis,
Euherdmania claviformis and sandy lobes, excape successful
predation by zooid-only-eaters. The sand provides an
extra barrier of protection for the zooids. These tunicates
were successfully eaten only by Megathura and Patiria, both
voracious zooid-plus-tunic-eaters.
Overall, A. californicum is the most preferred tunicate,
Clavelina ranks second and A. psammion is one of the third
most preferred species. (figure 2) This preference may
correlate directly with the intertidal abundance of species
as these top three choices simultaneously rank the same in
abundance intertidally (Pulliam, 1981). The predators may
