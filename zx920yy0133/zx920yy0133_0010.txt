have already been conditioned to eating one of the top three
species in the field, so when brought into lab, they continued
to feed on the same favored species. Many of the Megatebennus
and Diodora specimens were collected either on or near
A. californicum, and did, in fact, favor A. californicum
during lab feedings.
There appears to be no definite coorelation between
body form (solitary, social or compound) and the degree of
predation. (tables 1-5) and figures 1 and 2)
Both
A. californicum and Clavelina, the top two choices, are
non-ascidic and contain low concentrations of vanadium,
whereas Euherdmania and Distaplia occidentalis, the two least
predated species, contain high concentrations of vanadium
(Abbott and Newberry, 1980). However, A. psammion also
contains high vanadium concentrations and has a pH of 1-2.
yet ranks number three. Though there may exist chemical
defenses against predation, they certainly do not offer a
complete means of protection.
Feeding studies of individual predators would be useÂ¬
ful in determining the importance of tunicates in predator
diets. The rarer species Trivia, Lamellaria and Erato tend
to be specialists, eating only one or two tunicate species
(figure 3). These would be interesting to study, but their
rarity may make it difficult to accumulate data.
The two nost common predators, Hermissenda and Patiria,
ate a larger variety of ascidian species (seven and eight,
respectively). These certainly would lend themselves to
