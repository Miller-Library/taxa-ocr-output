were starved for five days and allowed to get accustomed
to lab conditions before presenting tunicates,
Tunicate specimens used in feeding observations were
collected from the intertidal and subtidal at HMS, and from
the Monterey Marina floats (Diplosoma macdonaldi, Botryllus spp.
Botrylloides spp., and Ascidia ceratodes). Colonies or
pieces of colonies, approximately 20 cm2 in surface area,
were tied to the bottom of the cages or tied to glass slides
and placed on cage bottoms to prevent predators from turning
over tunicates and eating them from the potentially injured
bottom of the colony.
A total of nineteen tunicate species were fed to
predator suspects. During an observation run one or more
individuals of a suspected predator species would be exposed
to equal amounts of six or seven species of ascidians for two
to three days. Observation runs were made until all suspects
had been exposed twice to all ninteen ascidians.
During the first 24 hours, observations were made every
one to two hours and every three to six hours thereafter,
Every observation was scored for successful feeding, feeding
activity without observed success, and association of predator
on tunicate species with no observable feeding activity.
After the two to three days of feeding, all tunicates were
removed from the cages and checked for any damage or effects
due to predation such as missing zooids or digested tunic.
During the observations, individual feeding behavior and
tunicate responses were noted.
