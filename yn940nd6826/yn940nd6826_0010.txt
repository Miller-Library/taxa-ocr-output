polluted, if there is inhibition to fertilization it is a
good indicator that the water is polluted and corrective
steps should be taken.
CONCLUSION
1. The sensitivity of fertilization of sea urchin eggs
was tested in waters of various degrees of sewage pollution.
2. Fertilization seems very sensitive to chlorine
and removal of chlorine from sewage polluted water often
restores water quality with respect to ability of fertili-
zation of sea urchin eggs.
3. However, in some cases, removal of chlorine did not
restore water quality, and fertilization was still very low.
This suggests that other pollutants which effect sea urchin
fertilization are present in sewage effluent.
4. It is suggested that the use of fertilization of
sea urchin eggs might be an easy and valuable technique
for testing water quality, although it cannot be the sole
standard for water quality.
