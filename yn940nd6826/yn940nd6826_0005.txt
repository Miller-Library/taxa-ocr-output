was a slight turbidity to the samples, there was no noticable
gradation.
Water, considered to be unpolluted, was taken off Hopkins
Marine Station, filtered through a 0.45 u millipore filter
and stored at 4°C. This water was used as the unpolluted
"control"against the water from Pacific Grove and Monterey
throughout the experiment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
All experiments were conducted at 15°Ciunder artificial
light. Twenty-five ml. Erlenmeyer flasks were used for the
experiments because of their relatively large bottom surface
area. Before transfering the water to the flasks all samples
to be tested were well mixed. The water samples were tested
undiluted and the following dilutions: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and
1:16. Eggs and sperm were obtaineddby injecting O.5M KCI
into the sea urchins and collectinggthe shed gametes in filtered
sea water. The eggs were washed twice with filtered sea
water. Approximately 0.5 ml. of egg suspension or enough eggs
to form a single layer on the bottom of the flask, and 0.3 ml.
of sperm suspension or approximately one hundred sperm per
egg were used for each test. The sperm was allowed to sit
in the samples for ten minutes before the eggs were added.
This means these tests were actually on the effects of
different water on sperm viability. Ten minutes after the
eggs were mixed with the sperm, aliquots were removed and
observed under the microscope for elevation of the fertili¬
zation membrane. Two hundred eggs of each aliquot were counted.
