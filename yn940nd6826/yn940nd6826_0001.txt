ABSTRACT
The sensitivity of sea urchin egg fertilization was
tested in waters of various degrees of chlorinated and
unchlorinated domsetic sewage. Chlorine in sewage, especially
diluted sewage, was found to strongly inhibit sea urchin
fertilization. Removal of chlorine suggested that there
were other pollutants present in sewage effluent. The
sea urchin fertilization bioassay may be useful in indicating
pollution though it cannot act as the sole indicator of water
quality.
