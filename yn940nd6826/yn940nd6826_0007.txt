Monterey
The results from the Monterey experiments also show
inhibition by both chlorine and some other pollutant (fig.586).
The Monterey Health Department rated May 24, 1971 as an average
day with the chlorinator adding 2 ppm. chlorine to the sewage
effluent. However on May 3 and May 10 the chlorinator had
been malfunctioning. On May 3 the addition of chlorine had
been very low and then spurted relatively high. The coloform
counts taken at the same time as my samples were low, only
230 mpn. at the boil, also indicating that the chlorine was
high at that time. On May 10 there was less than 1.0 ppm.
chlorine being added to the effluent at the time of the sampling,
and the coloform counts were high, 4600 mpn. at the boil,
indicating a very low chlorine count. Fertilization of the
sea urchin gametes was low on May 3 and high on May 10,
suggesting that the different amount of chlorine in the
effluent directly influenced the water quality. Variations
in the effluent over a period of time are indicated in the
results from May 24 with the outer stations showing lower
values than the boil. The lower values on May 3 at the boil
and 100 meters to the north and west indicate the effluent
was dispersing from the boil in those directions.
I ran developmental tests on samples from both Monterey
and Pacific Grove (fig.7). The Monterey samples showed some
cases of slight variations in development from the filtered
sea water while the Pacific Grove samples indicated that
those eggs that were fertilized developed normally.
