sperm seem sensitive to environmental changes. Furthermore,
the development rates of sea urchins are relatively rapid
so changes can be detected over a short period of time.
Kobayashi (1971) proposed that water quality could be
bioassayed by the ability of sea urchin eggs to be fertilized
in test waters. He tested the quality of the water in the
vicinity of Seto Marine Biological Laboratory, Japan, using
fertilization, cell division, gastrulation, polyspermy, and
exogastrulation as indicators. Using eggs and sperm of
Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus amd Anthocidaris crassispina
he tested water from the open sea side of Hatakejima Island,
the land side of Hatakejima Island, Tsunashirazu Cove, and
the running sea water system of the laboratory. He concluded,
"...any signs of biologically significant pollution have
seemingly not yet been observed in the laboratory water
and the water from the open sea side of Hatakejima Island,
but a considerable pollution is already difinable in the water
from the land side of the island and the water from TsunaÂ¬
shirazu Cove, especially in the latter." Using this work as
a basis for further studies, I conducted experiments with
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus on water taken from the Mon-
terey sewage outfall and the Pacific Grove sewage outfall.
