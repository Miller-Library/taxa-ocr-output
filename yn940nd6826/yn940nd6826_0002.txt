INTRODUCTION
In recent years, with the rising awareness of pollution
in the environment, it has become necessary to find ways of
measuring environmental quality. Much work has been done
to find effective bioassays which can indicate environmental
deterioration. For an arganism to be a good bioassay it
must show effects clearly, simply, and quantitatively.
Moreover, the organism must be sufficiently abundant year
round to be used any time. Many organisms have been tested
as bioassays for indicating pollution including diatoms,
crustaceans, bivalves, and many fish, especially stickel¬
backs, with varying success (Wilber, 1969; Warren, 1971;
Tarzwell, 1971). Some of the major difficulties have been
the hardiness of the organisms and the length of time required
to get results. The organisms that are hardy enough to
culture in the laboratory are usually too hardy to show
subtle changes in environmental quality.
Sea urchin gametes have the potential for being excellent
test material. In many regions of the world, several species
occure withe overlapping spawning seasons so gametes can
be found at any time of the year. Sea urchins can be kept
for long periods of time in the laboratory, and can be chem¬
ically induced to shed eggs and sperm. While the mature
organism is relatively hardy, the eggs and especially the
