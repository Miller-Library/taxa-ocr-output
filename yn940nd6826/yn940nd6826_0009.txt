effects of oil on sea urchin fertilization, found that while
most crude and refined oils saturated in sea water did not
appreciably effect the sperm before fertilization, development
was inhibited almost completely for most oils at dilutions
down to 6.25%.
Originally the experimental design called for the use of
artificial sea water as the unpolluted control and for making
the sewage effluent-sea water dilutions. This seemed desirable
because the components of the water would be known and constant.
However the Ward's artificial sea water that I used inhibited
the fertilization from 10 to 90%.
The varying effect of different toxicants on sea urchin
fertilization and development show the system to be a poor
overall pollution indicator. While a high coloform count
at Monterey on May 10 showed high levels of sewage in the
water, the sea urchin test was not sensitive to it. Sample
waters had very little effectoon developmentin Kobayashi's
(1971) and my data, but an overwhelming effect was found
by Allen (1971) with oils. It seems unlikely that any bio¬
assay can be found that will be a good indicator for all
pollution. Rather a system could be devised that uses several
bioassays for different toxicants. Coloform counts are
now in use to determine human waste concentrations. The
sea urchin bioassay might be another useful and relatively
straightforeward indicator of water quality, especially
with respect to chlorine, heavy sewage, and petroleum pro¬
ducts. While this bioassay cannot prove the water is not
