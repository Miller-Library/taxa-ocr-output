The water from each sample was tested twice: first on the
day of collection of the water, and then on the following
day. Development was observed six hours after the eggs were
mixed with the sperm by counting the percentage of fertilized
eggs which had reached the eight cell stage.
Muchmore (1970) researching the effectsoof chlorine
on sea urchin fertilization, used sodium thiosulphate to
reduce free chlorine and neutralize its effect. Following
this I also neutralized the chlorine in some of my samples
with excess sodium thiosulphate.
RESULTS
Pacific Grove
The results from the Pacific Grove water samples show
that chlorine strongly inhibits fertilization. Inhibition
of fertilization by chlorine was especially evident after
dilution of the sewage. (figr 2,3,4185)at Foreekampletat the
outfall, inhibition of fertilization could be removed by
removal of the chlorine from dilutions of more than 1:4.
Further from the outfall, at sites 2aand 3, removal of chlorine
at dilutions above 1:4 increased the percent of fertilization.
Therefore, at high sewage concentrations, materials other
than chlorine suppressed fertilization. Allowing the samples
to sit in stoppered bottles overnight usually caused a
decrease in the effect of the inhibitor, but this was not
due only to decrease of chlorine in the samples (see, for
example 20 May, fig 3).
