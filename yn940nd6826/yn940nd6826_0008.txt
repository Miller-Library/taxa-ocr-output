INTERPRETATION
These results show that high concentrations of sewage
can have definite effects on sea urchin fertilization, but
low concentrations have little effects. The system, there¬
fore, does not seem very sensitive for sewage pollution.
Chlorine in the sewage appears to strongly effect fertilization;
however other substances in the effluent also suppress fert¬
ilization, especially when at high concentrations.
Kobayashi (1971) found much lower inhibition of ferti-
lization in his samples than I found in mine (fig.8). Four
out of nine cases fromthealand side of Hatakejima and four
out of six cases from Tsunashirazu Cove varied more than one
standard deviation fron the mean value of the unpolluted
samples from the laboratory. Only four values varied more
than two standard deviation units. The occurance of values
below one standard deviation for development supports his
conclusions that the water on the land side of Hatakejima
and Tsunashirazu Cove werecpolluted, but in all his
experiments the development values were relatively high,
over 90%.
Muchmore (1970) with dilutions of sewage effluent from
the Pacific Grove outfall of 33%, 10%, and 5% neutralized
for chlorine, concluded, "Tests show that the effects of
unchlorinated domestic sewage on fertilization is relatively
slight, especially when compared to the effect of chlorinated
sewage." I also found at low concentrations, unchlorinated
sewage has little effect on fertilization. Other pollutants,
however, can effect gametes. Allen (1971), testing the
