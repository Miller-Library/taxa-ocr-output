Water samples
Pacific Grove, California, discharges approximately
1.26 million gallons of primary treated sewage daily with
a peak hour flow of 6.0 million gallons per day from an outfall
on Point Pinos. The end of the outfall is located off a
rocky intertidal area with a southern exposure and lies
one foot below mean lower low water in a region of heavy
surf. Samples were taken at low tide from three sites:
site 1, the outfall; site 2, five meters to the west; and site
3, five meters to the east (fig.1). The rocks at site I
were deviod of any but microscopic life. The rocks at the
other two collection points were populated almost solely
by stunted specimens of the red algae Prionitus lanceolata.
The lack of species diversity reflects the influence of
pollutants in the water. I observed a turbidity in the water
samples due to particulate matter coming from the outfall.
The water samples taken from the three sites had a consistent
grading of turbidity of 1 greater than 2 greater than 3.
Monterey, California, discharges an average of 2.67
million gallons of secondary treated sewage per day with a
peak hour flow of 8.6 million gallons per day into the
Monterey Bay through a submerged pipe approximately 10 meters
deep. Samples were taken from the surface between 9:00 and
10:00 a.m. at markers on the boil and 100 and 200 meters in
each cardinal direction, and stored at 4Â°C. Though there
