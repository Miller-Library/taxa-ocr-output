can be defined for higher and lower regions. The higher occurring
plants have greater number of, but shorter, fronds with a greater
holdfast area per total plant area. The higher level plants are
more uniform in shape and resemble a turf. At lower heights, the
fronds are longer, but there are fewer fronds per holdfast.
The
bases of the plants, just above the holdfast, are thinnest at
lower tidal heights and increase in thickness with vertical
height in the zone.
The distribution of various life history stages show that
during spring in these areas, few tetrasporangial plants are
present. The male plus sterile plants are most abundant and were
found higher than the females within each region. The highest
percentage of males to females was at the most exposed site
(site #1), while the highest percentage of females occurred at
the calmest site (site #3). The males tend to be shorter and
less branched than the females.
At this time of year, more males are present, suggesting
timing differences in life history, or natural dominance or
fertilization is less effective. The females are larger and
longer to accommodate the carpospores which cover their thallus
surface. Perhaps female plants have narrow tolerance ranges;
further studies would need to be done to identify site selection
factors.
2) LAB STUDIES
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimentation was done to determine desiccation (percent
weight loss) of Rhodoglossum affine over time. Vegetative fronds
from all nine locations were collected at a low tide and kept in
running sea water for 12 hours before initiation of the experiment.
Individual fronds were weighed; then dried at room temperature (+22'c).
