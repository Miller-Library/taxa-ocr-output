RESULTS
The Rhodoglossum affine from all locations dried at
approximately the same rate, reaching a maximum weight loss of
60-70% of original weight after five hours of exposure to
air. The algae from site f3, the calmest locale, dried
faster than the other sites, and lost the most water(75%),
whereas the fronds from site +2 lost only 65% of the original
weight. (Fig. 6)
The R. affine from every level survived temperatures up
to 35°C, but at 40°C all were bleached, thecriterion for death.
The results show that of the plants highest in position, only
the tips bleached, whereas in plants of lower positions up
to 75% of the thalli were bleached. At 45°C all of the plants
experienced total death. Atlow temperatures (from 22°0 to 0°C
during a 45 min. run), samples from all areas survived. Even
after 60 minutes at 0°0, no damage to the fronds was observed
(Fig. 7).
In long term desiccation experiments the algae were dried
at room temperature for 55 hours with no detrimental effects;
all of the fronds rehydrated andsurvived when placed in sea
water. In repeated desiccation tesis, Rhodoglossum could be
desiccated 3-5 times for up to 8 hours andstill recover its
ability to imbibe water.
In each run of the respirometer, algae from the same
site (from high andlow levels) were run together in order to
get a comparative measurement. Runs were made using fronds which
had been desiccated for between one and three hours. According
to L. Hodgson (personal communication) after 3-5 hours
photosynthetic rates begin to drop to zero and no further
rates can be properly measured. Results of one and five hours
Of desiccation show that plants form more exposed sites have
