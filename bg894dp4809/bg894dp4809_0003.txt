INTRODUCTION
The environmental conditions of the high intertidal zone
appear to be harsh for the algae inhabiting those positions.
One alga, Rhodoglossum affine (Harv.)Kyl. occupies a specific
location in the Pacific intertidal (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976),
approximately +0.5 - +2.5 ft. above MLLW according to Smith (1944).
In this study, the zone was extended to +4.5 ft. What makes
possible the occupancy of this location and how are the plants
affected? This paper examines Rhodoglossum to determine its
zonation, distribution, abundance and ability to withstand
desiccation and temperature stress in terms of tidal height.
Both morphological and physiological variations were studied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The first part of the project was to determine the
distribution and abundance of the life phases of Rhodoglossum affine
in the midintertidal region. Samples were taken to observe the
structure of the algal community at different sites. Three areas
were chosen with varying degrees of wave exposure: 1) a small
pocket beach at Third Street, Pacific Grove, 2) northwest rocks
of Mussel Point, and 3) west rocks of Pt. Alones (Fig. 1). At
each site a transect was run perpendicular to the coast; along
each line Rhodoglossum clumps were selected at different heights.
Each site consisted of three levels: high (3.8 ft.), middle (2.8 ft.)
and low (2.3 ft.); above 0.0 ft. tide level. The sampling
technique was to place a 20 cmx 20 cm quadrat with 10 rows of
dots at each tidal height, in four separate locations within one
meter to either side of the transect line. These areas were not
