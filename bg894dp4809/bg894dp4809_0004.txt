chosen randomly, but picked for their concentration of R. affine.
Within each quadrat the algae percent cover of Rhodoglossum was
measured and the life stage, number of fronds per holdfast, and
the size and length of individual fronds were noted. Cross-
sections were made of several fronds from each clump at the base,
mid and top areas to determine cortex and medulla thicknesses.
RESULTS
The abundance of Rhodoglossum affine plants was largest at
the middle exposure site (site #2 ), although the alga was present
in considerable number at all locations. In terms of the
distribution of life phases, there was always a greater number
of male and sterile plants than female plants (Fig. 2). The
females were found lower down within each area, below the male
plants. Very few tetrasporangial plants were found, and they
were always in the lower zone. The female Rhodoglossum plants
were longer and more branched than the males with smaller
holdfasts containing fewer fronds. The percentage of total plant
area which was holdfast is largest at high levels and decreases
with lowering height (Fig. 3), while the number of fronds per
holdfast increases from low to high (Fig. 4). The length of
the fronds is greatest at lower levels (Fig. 5). The data from
the cross-sections of the fronds show that the only significant
difference in the thicknesses of medulla and cortex between zones
is at the base of the frond. The width of the base decreases with
lower tidal heights. Other thicknesses do not vary with specific
heights or sites.
DISCUSSION
At all sites examined, the morphology of Rhodoglossum affine
