At 1-hour intervals, the fronds were reweighed then reemersed
until a constant level of weight loss was attained.
Temperature stress experiments were performed in which
vegetative fronds of similar size (collected at low tide from
all zones) were placed in beakers of sea water, in a large water
bath. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes.
then the bath temperature was increased or decreased. At 5°c
intervals, several fronds were placed back in running sea water.
Death was determined by loss of pigmentation. Observations of
survival were made for 2 weeks, allowing time for the temperature
effects to be visible in the algae.
Desiccation experiments were designed to reflect a correlation
to photosynthetic rate. The algae were again collected at low
tide from the three sites, taking the entire plant including
holdfast. These plants were kept in a tank of running sea water
until the time of experimentation. Only undamaged, vegetative
fronds of the R. affine plants were used. The experiments were
run at the same time every day to avoid the possible effects of
a circadian rhythm of photosynthesis (Harris, 1978). The rates
of net photosynthesis were determined using a Gilson pressure
constant differential respirometer with a 195,Emes bulb. This
procedure has been documented by Umbreit (1972). The side arm
contained 1 ml of standard bicarbonate buffer solution to keep
CO» at normal levels throughout the duration of each run (Pratt, 1943)
The temperature was set at 12°0. The algae were weighed, dried
in 22°C air to the appropriate level of desiccation and then
placed in the vessels. There were 3 - 6 replicates for every run.
The flasks were equilibrated 30 minutes prior to each run; readings
were taken every 20 minutes for 200 minutes. The data were recorded
svelved
as follows: 102 g (wet weight) : time.
