desiccation may signal the higher plants of a zone to speed up
their rates of photosynthesis. The higher plants are often
exposed to lengthy periods in air and must be able to regulate
their activity during desiccation. The lower zoned plants
spend less time in theair; they haveadapted an energy efficent
system of lowering their rates during short desiccation times,
and not respond to tidal cues in the same manner as the
higher plants.
CONCLUSIONS
The structure of the Rhodoglossum affine population varies
with relation to the tidal height of the region. Higher zoned
plants have shorter and more numerous fronds with larger
holdfast areas; thelower plants tend to be long and thin with
fewer fronds per holdfast. The thickness of the fronds changes
with vertical height, but only with respect to thethickness
of the cortex in the basal section. The higher placed plants
have a thicker cortex than low plants. The higher plants as a
clump have more surface area and thicker fronds to withstand
wave shock; shorter fronds would also help in storing water and
protecting against desiccation.
The distribution of Rhodoglossum affine was found to be
correlated with tidal height. Thenumber ofmale plus sterile
plants was greater than the number of females; with the
largest number of females located beneath the male andsterile
plants in each region. Tetrasporangial plants were sparse at
the sampling sites, possibly dueto a seasonal fluctuation.
When found, they were located in lower levels. Female
plants were generally longer and thinner the themale plants
