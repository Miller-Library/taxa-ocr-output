with more branching and fewer fronds per holdfast.
In a population of Rhodoglossum there are also physiolog-
ical differences. Some variations are between plants of
several tidal heights. The response to heat stress shows this;
higher placed plants can withstand higher temperatures and
survive. Also, higher level plants can recover after five
hours of desiccation and have an increased rate of photo-
synthesis when compared to lower plants of thesame zone.
Some distinctions between Rhodoglossum occur between
sites, a factor affected by wave exposure. Plants from site f3
a calmer zone dried out faster and had a greater weight loss
than the other, rougher zones. The Rhodoglossum of the more
exposed sites had a higher photosynthetic rate after desiccation
than the calmer site plants.
