temperature of 40°0, the fronds all showed somesigns of death,
with the higher zoned plants surviving better. These would
be the plants which undergo the longest amount of exposure during
a tidal cycle; it is advantagous to be able to endure extremes
of stress. Good evidence of the adaptation of Rhodoglossum
affine to the intertidal region is its ability to tolerate
desiccation and recover with rewetting. Tidal exposure is
therefore not hazardous to the population.
In the desiccation  photosynthesis experiments, the
distinction between theamount of exposure was more significant
than thedistinction between tidal heights. After 1 and 5 hours
of drying the Rhodoglossum plants of the more exposed sites
had a higher photosynthetic rate. After 3 hours of desiccation
all plants showed a decrease in rate. Higher zoned plants
recovered at five hours and increased their photosynthetic
activity; the lower plants remained at a lower level of
photosynthesis.
The reasons for a higher ratefor the more exposed sites
may have to do with numerous environmental parameters. The
more exposed plants face more stressful conditions and this
may reflect in their rates of photosynthesis. The higher
zoned plants recover after 5 hours of drying and increase
their photosynthetic rates. Thisecoùld be due to an environmental
cue. The algae need some amount of desiccation to enhance
their photosyntetic abilities. (Gessner & Schramm) According
to Doty (1946) zonation can be attributed to the ability of
thealga to tolerate the stress of exposure; this could also
be true within the Rhodoglossum species. The high andlow level
plants slow their rates after 3 hours of drying, but increased
