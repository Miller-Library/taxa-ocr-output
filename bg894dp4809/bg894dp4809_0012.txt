ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I express my gratitude to all the professors and students
of the spring class, 1979, especially Bill MacGruder and Dr.
Robin Burnett. I would also like to thank Lynn Hodgson for
her help with the photosynthesis data. My warmest and deepest
appreciation to Dr. Isabella Abbott; without her I never would
have learned to appreciate the plants of the ocean.
