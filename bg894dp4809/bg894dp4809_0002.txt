ABSTRACT
Rhodoglossum affine (Rhodophyta) is a midintertidal alga
of the Pacific Coast; its position is +0.5 to +4.5 ft. tidal
level. The most abundant life phase is male plus sterile,
occurring higher than females in the same region. Tetrasporangial
plants are sparse, possibly due to the season. Morphological
measurements were taken which show plants higher inposition have
shorter fronds with larger holdfast area containing more fronds
per holdfast than lower zoned plants. Stress tolerances of
Rhodoglossum were examined noting thephysiological changes of
the plants in relation to vertical height and exposure. Higher
level plants tolerated increased temperatures with greater
survival than lower plants. Desiccation effects of Rhodoglossum
were studied as afuntion of net photosynthetic rates. More
exposed plants have higher rates after 1 and 5 hours of drying
compared to calmer sites. Higher level plants exhibit a
recovery of photosynthesis after 3 hoursof desiccation.
