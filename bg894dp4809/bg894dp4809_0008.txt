higher rates of photosynthesis. At 3 hours, all plants show
a decrease in photosynthetic activity. After 5 hours of
drying, the plants higher in vertical zonation show a period
of recovery and increase their rates, while low plants continue
to decrease their photosynthetic rates. (Fig. 8 & 9) The
calculations for these rates were analyzed using an average
weight of a frond for each zone, and figured out for net
photosynthetic rates in1 0 evolved : gram wet weight : hour.
DISCUSSION
The Rhodoglossum affine fronds undergo a rapid loss in
weight during a desiccation period; an average loss of 50% of
wet weight after 2-3.5 hours andaa maximum weight loss at
five hoursof 60-75%. The levels seem uniform with an average
loss of 68% after five hours. In the natural environment,
thevarious levels have different exposure times for a tidal
cycle; ranging for 23 hours per cycle to 7 hours per cycle.
All of the fronds were re-emersed in sea water at the conclusion
of the experiment (55 hours); they all rehydrated and
appeared to survive, showing a broad tolerance to desiccation
stress, more than ever encountered during normal weather
conditions. It would be interesting to repeat this test with
the added varibles of windbrheat, which would better assimilate
natural conditions and possibly lower the survival rate.
In the temperature stress experiment, R. affine showed
remarkable tolerance; all levels had the ability to withstand
a temperature range of 0 C to 35 C without damaging effects.
Rhodoglossum is well-adapted to its position in theintertidal;
tolerating any climatic temperature range. At the high
