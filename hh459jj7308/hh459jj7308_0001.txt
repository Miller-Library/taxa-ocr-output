INTRODUCTION
Chitons and limpets represent two different classes of the phylum
Mollusca; yet they seem to perform very similar functions in the intertidal
community. They are slow-moving, grazing herbivores occurring together
throughout the intertidal. The similarity of their food and habitat
provoked a closer investigation of their apportionment of resources
within the sympatric areas.
In the portion of the intertidal zone of the central California
coast marked by the brown alga Pelvetia fastigiata (J. G. Agardh) DeToni,
two common species each of chitons and limpets can be found: Cyanoplax
hartwegii (Carpenter, 1855) and Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846), and
Collisella pelta (Rathke, 1833) and Collisella limatula (Carpenter, 1846).
While Cyanoplax can be found in its greatest abundance in this area
(Ricketts and Calvin, 1968), C. pelta, C. limatula and Mopalia can be
found throughout the intertidal (Test, 1945; Andrua and Legard, 1974).
Eaton (1968) and Craig (1968) distinguished the different food preferences
of Collisella limatula and C. pelta.
To identify habitat differences among these intertidal herbivores,
I conducted a general survey of their spatial distribution and of the
behavioral aspects of resource apportionment. The study was
conducted from April to June, 1974 in the high intertidal of three areas
of Monterey County, California: Mussel Point, Point Pinos and Carmel
Point. All three intertidal areas consist of granite rock outcroppings
surrounded by sand.
