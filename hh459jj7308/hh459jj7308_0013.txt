FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1. Distribution of Cyanoplax and Mopalia along transects run
through the Pelvetia zone. Numerals and bar graphs show number of Cyanoplax
per 30 cm x 30 cm quadrat. Darkened circles represent single Mopalia
individuals.
a, Topographical map of rock at Point Pinos. Contour lines represent four
inches of vertical displacement.
b. & c. Cross-sectional representation of transects at Mussel Point viewed
perpendicular to the surf line. The bars of the graphs represent the number
of Cyanoplax in laterally adjacent quadrats at the same vertical height.
Figure 2. Particle size of sand grains on two sides of Carmel Point.
The Pelvetia zone is at the same vertical height on both sides of the point.
Figure 3. Distance from chitons to all neighbors within 20 cm. Density is
the interpolated density of animals around each chiton (animal number/ m2).
a., b. & c. represent distance from each Cyanoplax to other Cyanoplax (a.),
Collisella limatula (b.) and Collisella pelta (c.).
d. & e. represent distance from each Mopalia to C. limatula (d.) and
C. pelta (e.).
Figure 4. Size frequency of limpets within 20 cm versus those more than
50 cm from the nearest Cyanoplax or Mopalia.
Figure 5. Effects of changing Collisella pelta density on the number of
Cyanoplax in a commonly used home area. Normal C. pelta density was doubled (J),
or all C. pelta were removed (*).
