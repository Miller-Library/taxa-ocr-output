MOVEMENT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE LIMPETS AND CHITONS
In the Mussel Point area, I selected a rocky outcropping covered with
Pelvetia, under which Cyanoplax hartwegii, Mopalia muscosa, Collisella pelta
and Collisella limatula were found. Movement of these animals was observed for
two 24-hour periods, one 48-hour period and one 60-hour period, The moyement
of thirteen Cyanoplax was plotted every hour during the 48-hour and the 60-hour
watches. The movement of eleven C. pelta was plotted over a 36-hour period, and
the movement of five C. limatula was plotted over a 60-hour period. Positions
of all animals were checked every hour (Figure 7).
Field observations of Cyanoplax movement (Lyman, 1974) and Collisella
pelta (using scoring method of Lyman, 1974) movement showed the two species
to be quite similar. Both moved more at night, and more when either awash or
exposed than when submerged (C. pelta average movement- night, 1.2 cy; day,
.3 cy; Pe.001: exposed, 1.1 cw; submerged, .5 cy; Pc.01). Collisella limatula,

on the other hand, moved more when submerged or awash (x - 1.8 cp) than when
dry (x - .3 cy; Pc.001), but moved equally during the night and day (.5cPf.75).
Eaton (1968) has also observed greater submerged movement in C. limatula,
and Smith (1974) observed Mopalia muscosa to move mostly at night when submerged.
While Cyanoplax, Collisella limatula and Collisella pelta all show some
degree of specific homing (Lyman, 1974; Eaton, 1968; and Craig, 1968), Cyanoplax
is the most nomadic of the three species. To quantify this movement, plots
were made of the distance of each animal from its starting point after 24 hours
(Figure 8). The traveling distance of Cyanoplax (X = 13.4 cm) was much greater
than that of either C. pelta (X - 3.8 cm; Mann-Whitney U-test: Pc.001) or
C. limatula (X = 4.3 cm; PÃ¦.001). No difference could be distinguished between
C. pelta and C. limatula (.4eP.5), which move more erratically within the
same general area. Average movement of the animals during the entire study
was Cyanoplax - 1.3 cm/hr, C. limatula - 1.1 cm/hr, C. pelta - .8 cm/hr; a
difference insufficient to totally cause the above results.
