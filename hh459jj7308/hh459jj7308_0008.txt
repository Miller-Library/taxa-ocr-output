CONNOR 9
SUMMARY
Niche partitioning by the chitons Cyanoplax hartwegii and
Mopalia muscosa, and the limpets Collisella limatula and Collisella
pelta, two classes of molluscs with similar functions in the intertidal
community, under the brown alga Pelvetia fastigiata was studied. Cyanoplax
and Mopalia were found to partition a common habitat by different
microhabitat preferences and behavioral patterns. Food niche overlap
with C. pelta was lessened by Mopalia's aggressive behavior. Food
niche overlap with C. limatula and resting area overlap with C. pelta
were lessened by Cyanoplax's nomadic behavior.
