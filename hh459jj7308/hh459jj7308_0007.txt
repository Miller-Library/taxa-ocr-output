CONNOR 8
DISCUSSION
Hutchinson (1957) has proposed that two sympatric species will
coexist only if each
exploits some aspect of the common environment
in a different way. If limiting, the environment must be partitioned
in terms of food preference, food procurement and the requisite
microhabitats necessary to tolerate physical and biological stresses.
The evidence presented here combined with other findings can be
used to demonstrate that these four intertidal herbivores partition
their environment by food preference, spatial restriction, and temporal
restriction. This evidence is summarized in Table I. In instances of
potential resource competition, mitigating factors separate the niches.
For example, Mopalia and Collisella pelta may be potentlal food
competitors; but their activity varies with submergence, and Mopalia's
aggressive behavior forces C. pelta to occupy different areas. Cyanoplax's
nomadic behavior, as opposed to the home area behavior of the limpets,
spatially limits its disturbance of the food niche of Collisella
limatula, and distinguishes it from C. pelta which retains individual
home areas for longer periods of time than Cyanoplax.
The results of this survey therefore seem to support the generally
accepted ecological principle that congeneric species (Paine, 1962;
Kohn, 1959; Bowers, 1964; Jeffries, 1966; Haven, 1971) and confamilial
species (Magnum, 1964; Croker,1967) will show definite niche separation
despite apparent similarities in habitat and behavior.
