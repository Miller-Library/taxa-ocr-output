FOOD COMPETITION BETWEEN CYANOPLAX AND COLLISELLA LIMATULA
Chitons in the Pelvetia zone at Mussel Point and Point Pinos
were randomly chosen; their position and the positions of the
chitons and limpets were noted and the body length of each animal
was recorded. Mapping of chiton neighbors (Figure 3) indicated
Collisella limatula to occur significantly further away (- 12.19 cm;
Student's t-test: Pf.05) from Cyanoplax than Cyanoplax was from
itself (x - 10.74 cm). C. pelta showed no such effect (X - 11.49 cm;
.2ePc. 4).
Size studies (Figure 4) demonstrated that Collisella limatula
within 20 cm of Cyanoplax were significantly smaller (X = 1.50 cm;
Pe.Ol) than C. limatula at least 50 cm away from the nearest
Cyanoplax (X = 1.80 cm).
Work by Robb (1974) has indicated that Cyanoplax hartwegii
found under Pelvetia has a diet consisting mostly of Pelvetia and
secondly Hildenbrandia occidentalis Setchell. Collisella limatula
depends mostly on Hildenbrandia and other crustose algae for its
food (Eaton, 1968) while Collisella pelta under Pelvetia eats mostly
Pelvetia and other frondose algae (Craig, 1968). Given the common
ha
elver
occurrence of large stands of thisaga in the intertidal, Pelvetia
is probably not a limiting food, but Hildenbrandia is less abundant
by several orders of magnitude. Food competition, then, may account
for the tendency of Collisella limatula to be further away from
Cyanoplax and to be larger when Cyanoplax is not in its immediate
vicinity.
