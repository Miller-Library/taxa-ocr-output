DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CYANOPLAX AND MOPALIA HABITATS
Transects were run at Mussel Point and Point Pinos through the
Pelvetia zone. Quadrats 30 cm x 30 cm were placed along the transect
with additional quadrats extending laterally to the entire width of

e rocks touched by the transect. The number of chitons and limpets
inside each quadrat was recorded.
These transects (Figure 1) indicate that Cyanoplax is more
abundant in the areas more protected from wave shock: higher rocks.
crevices and the shoreward side of rocks. Mopalia occurs at the lower
boundary of the Pelvetia zone in regions less protected from waye
action and at a lower tidal level. The limpets are found throughout
the transects.
At Carmel Point a survey was made at the same vertical height on
the protected and open sides of the point. On the protected side of
the point, Cyanoplax can be found at densities of 5-6/m?; while on
the open-coast side of the point, only Mopalia at a density of 1-2/m

can be found under-Peivetia-of a similar tidal height. The sand grain
size on the open side of the point (md√∏- -.991) is much larger than
on the protected side (md?-.453) where Cyanoplax is found (Figure 2),
While relative wave motion or wave shock cannot be precisely
determined from differences in grain size (Shepard, 1963), differences
as large as those observed between the two sides of the point indicate
that large differences in wave energy must be present in these two
habitats (Krumbein, 1944-1947).
