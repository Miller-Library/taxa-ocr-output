CONNOR 6
EXCLUSION BEHAVIOR OF MOPALIA MUSCOSA TOWARDS COLLISELLA PELTA
While the density of Collisella limatula within 20 cm of Cyanoplax
was the same as its density near Mopalia (16.7/m2; see Figure 3),
Collisella pelta was much less dense in the vicinity of Mopalia (10.7/m2)
than around Cyanoplax (21.7/m2; G-test of independence: .Ol«p..025).
C. pelta within 20 cm of Mopalia were significantly smaller (Figure 4;
X = 2.39 cm; P«.05) than those at least 50 cm away from Mopalia (X - 2.75 cm).
In order to test whether Mopalia selectively excludes Collisella
pelta from its immediate area, C. pelta from a similar habitat were
placed one cm from the girdle of a submerged Mopalia. A control
C. pelta was placed on a matched substrate about 20 cm from the Mopalia.
After one hour the distance of the C. pelta from its starting position
was measured. In the ten trials run (Figure 6), the C. pelta near the
Mopalia always moved further (Mann-Whitney U-test: X - 9.8 cm;Pe.001)
than the controls (X - 3.0 cm). Contact did not seem to be a prerequisite
for moving, but in half the cases the chiton was seen to actively push
the limpet away with its girdle. This behavior was also twice observed
naturally in the field. C. pelta was the only animal observed to be
actively excluded by Mopalia. When Cyanoplax and Collisella limatula
were placed next to Mopalia, no reaction occurred.
Feeding studies of Mopalia muscosa (Barnawell, 1954; Boolootian,
1964; Smith, 1974) show that Pelvetia is not a source of food for
M. muscosa. Mopalia must rely on less abundant stands of Gigartina
papillata (C.A. Agardh) J.G. Agardh or Endocladia muricata (Postels
and Ruprecht) J.G. Agardh in the Pelvetia zone. As mentioned earlier,
Collisella pelta in this intertidal zone has been reported to eat
primarily Pelvetia; however, C. pelta in other zones eats both Gigartina
and Endocladia. The incursion of C. pelta, then, could represent a threat
atively limited food supply.
