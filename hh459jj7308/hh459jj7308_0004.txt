HOMESTTE CONPETITTON BETUEEN CYANOPLAX AVD COLLISELLA PELTA
Data shown in Figure 3 was subjected to statistical analysis to
determine the degree of specific and interspecific aggregation. Clumping
around individuals of Cyanoplax is evident; Cyanoplax apparently occurs
mostly in the vicinity of other Cyanoplax (C-test - 58.3), but Collisella
limatula (G - 14.9) also show a significant tendency to aggregate near
Cyanoplax (P6.001). The difference between Cyanoplax's and C. pelta's
clumping cannot be distinguished (Arcsin transformation of percentages of
the total number of animals within 10 cm of the chiton (Box 16.10, Sokal
and Rohlf, 1969): .18 PC.2); while Cyanoplax shows significantly more
clumping with other Cyanoplax than with C. limatula (.OIC.PK.05).
Evidently there are certain locations on the rocks which are favorite
resting areas for the organisms, but within these favored areas comparative
exclusions can occur. Lyman (1975) has shown different Cyanoplax individuals
to repeatedly use the same set of home areas and these results suggest
that Cyanoplax and Collisella pelta might compete for these specific
home areas. When the number of C. pelta on a rock face also containing
Cyanoplax and C. limatula was experimentally doubled (from 6/ .1 m' to
12/ .1 m') in an area commonly used for homes by Cyanoplax, Cyanoplax
density decreased (Figure 5). Collisella limatula was not affected. When
the C. pelta were removed, the Cyanoplax returned. Observations suggested
that appropriate sites were occupied on a "first come, first served" basis.
