Introduction
The errant polychete Eumida bifoliata (family Phyllodocidae)
is known in central and southern California from sandy silts and shelly
sediments (Hartmann,1968;Smith and Carlton,1975).The species also lives
among the tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica and was one of 171
species of animals found by Donat (1975) on concrete pilings covered
with Phyllochaetopterus
prolifica beneath Monterey Municipal Wharf #2.
A quick survey of clusters of tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prol
ica
indicated that Eumida bifoliata, generally regarded as an active, free-
living scavenger, could on occassion be found occupying the distal
portions of Phyllochaetopterus tubes. This was noted by Donat (1975) in
his survey of the wharf pilings but no other mention of this behavior
was found in the literature.Observations of the behavior of Eumida
bifoliata in and among the tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica form
the basis of this paper.
Materials and Methods
Samples were taken during April and May, 1976 from floats in the
Monterey Marina to determine the occurrence and abundance of Eumida
bifoliata and other phyllodocids in colonies of Phllochaetopterus pro-
fica (see Fig.1).Colonies and portions of colonies were peeled from
the styrofoam substrate and transported to the lab in a pail of fresh
seawater.One colony was placed in an aquarium for observation, Seawater
(1.
C) was kept circulating through the tank.The other samples were
kept in containers with running seawater until analysed for the species
of phyllodocids present, their relative numbers, and the frequency of
their occurrence inside tubes.Worms in tubes were detected by transÂ¬
