E. bifoliata in and among Phyllochaetopterus tubes
Imperato
material identical to that entrapped in the mucus at the tips of the tubes.
This material consisted of diatoms,blue-green algae,phytoplankton,bacteria,
protozoans,sponge spicules,some phyllodocid setae,and much unidentifiable
detritus.
Discussion
It is most probably advantageous for a worm to be able to change
its mode of living from errant to sedentary or vice versa as environmental
conditions dictate.While living inside tubes Eumida bifoliata enjoys the
same virtual protection from predators which allows Phyllochaetopterus
prolifica to grow so abundantly in the marina and under the wharf; but if
conditions become unfavorable the worm no doubt takes full advantage of
its errant capacity to move to a more favorable physical environment,seek
food or escape predation.
Eumida bifoliata's selection of short,otherwise empty tubes may yield
two advantages: 1) it can escape predators by the rear exit; and 2) the c
fact that there are no other inhabitants insures an unobstructed flow of
water through the tube.The water current serves to keep a fresh supply
of oxygenated water passing over the highly vascularized notopodia (Dales.
1963) thus aiding in respiration.
It is also probable that the water current plays a part in tubiculous
feeding.Eumida bifoliata may ingest the mucus inside the tube and derive
nourishment from the particles entrapped therein.Harley (1950) describes
a filter-feeding mechanism for the predacious errant polychete Nereis
diversicolor when the worm is placed inside a glass tube.MacGinitie (1937)
emphasized that the role of mucus in feeding in marine animals has been
greatly underestimated.One possible explanation for this is that the
