E. bifoliata in and among Phyllochaetopterus tubes
and continued crawling.
In tests for tube occupancy in an artificial colony, Eumida bifoliata
(n20) were placed in a bowl containing a cluster of plastic tubes
(8-10 cm long, i.d. 1.14 mm) half of which contained Phyllochaetopterus
prolifica and the other half of which were empty.Detritus and tunicates
obtained from a colony of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica were placed in
the bottom of the bowl.Roughly one-third of the worms entered and occupied
a tube within a day.Two phyllodocids were never seen to occupy the same
tube simultaneously nor was a phyllodocid ever seen to enter a tube
containing Phllochaetopterus prolifica.
When the two species were placed together in glass capillary tubes
(100 mm long, i.d. 0.9-1.1 mm) and immersed in a fingerbowl containing
seawater they cohabited for periods of 1-6 days (n-5).In all cases the
two species moved to opposite ends of the tube. By the end of the first
day each Phyllochaetopterus prolifica had built a partition at approx-
imately the mid-point of the tube.These partitions prevented any
physical contact between the species. In the field, one specimen was
found at the distal end of a tube that contained Phyllochaetopterus
prolifica as well.There was a similar partition about 3 cm from the end
of that tube.
Tubiculous behavior of Eumida bifoliata was observed in plastic
tubing (i.d. 1.3-1.6 mm),glass capillary tubes (i.d. 0.9-1.1 mm),and
some of the more transparent natural Phyllochaetopterus prolifica tubes.
(o.d. 0.7-1.2 mm).The worms were placed in the tubes by gentle suction
and submerged in fingerbowls filled with fresh seawater for observation
under a dissecting scope.
Certain patterns of behavior were seen repeatedly during observations
