E. bifoliata in and among Phyllochaetopterus tubes
Imperato
mucus is perfectly transparent unless laden with food (MacGinitie, 1937).
A detailed study of the feeding mechanism of Eumida bifoliata inside
tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica would no doubt yield interesting
results,
Summar
1. 10-63% of all specimens of the species Eumida bifoliata (fam.
Phyllodocidae) in a colony of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica were found
inhabiting Phyllochaetopterus tubes or portions thereof.
2. Another phyllodocid, Eulalia aviculiseta, was also found in-
habiting Phyllochaetopterus tubes.
3. Eumida bifoliata was the most abundant phyllodocid and its
behavior was observed among Phyllochaetopterus tubes as well as inside
glass,plastic,and natural tubes.
4. Worms irrigated the tubes and deposited mucus which appeare
to be employed in filter-feeding.
