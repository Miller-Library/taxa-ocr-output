E. bifoliata in and among Phyllochaetopterus tubes
Imperato
significant variation (p«.005) among colonies in the percentage of
phyllodocids found in tubes (Brandt and Snedecor, 1956; sect. 9.9).
Measurements were made of unanesthetized, inactive worms in a Petri
dish.Worms removed from tubes were of roughly the same length as those
found crawling freely.Body length varied from 20-35 mm and width was to
2 mm.Segments numbered about 45-95 (most had about 70).There were two
anal cirri but roughly one-third of all worms were found to be regen¬
erating a tail.
Eumida bifoliata was observed under a dissecting scope in a finger-
bowl containing seawater.Locomotion across the substrate was ditaxic.
The neuropodial setae were alternately extended and retracted as the
worm crawled.The leaflike notopodia seemed to be aiding locomotion by
pushing water posteriorly with thei broad surfaces.All secreted mucus
copiously from glands that seemed to be located near the parapodial lobes
but did not leave a visible trail behind them.
When worms crawled among tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica
placed in the fingerbowl their bodies were slightly longer than resting
length and correspondingly thinner.The tentacular cirri of segment i
projected forward as did the ventral cirri of segment 2,The dorsal cirri
of segment 2 stuck up at an angle of about 50 from the horizontal,and
the final pair of cirri,those of segment 3, projected laterally from the
body.The pigmentation of the head,antennae, and cirri was different from
that found in drawings of Eumida bifoliata in the literature (Hartmann,
1968; Smith and Carlton, 1975).The worm is depicted in Fig, 4.Worms.
crawling among Phyllochaetopterus tubes occassionally lifted the anterior
one-third to one-half of the body and waved the head in an exploratory
fashion.When the tentacular cirri came in contact with an object there
was usually a swift contraction after which the worm changed direction
