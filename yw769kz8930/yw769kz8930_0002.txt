E. bifoliata in and among Phyllochaetopterus tubes
illumination of the tubes with a 100 W lamp.All tubes containing species
other than Phyllochaetopterus prolifica were separated from the colony
and held in a fingerbowl containing fresh seawater for further study.
All phyllodocids found crawling among the tubes and in the sediment in
the bottom of the pan were isolated in another fingerbowl.Other clumps
were searched for phyllodocids without specifying tube occupancy (these
are labelled * in Fig. 1).
Observations of animals in and out of tubes were made with a dis¬
secting scope.Individuals were placed in tubes by suction, a method
described by Barnes (1965).
Results
The results of these characterizations (summarized in Fig.2) roughly
agree with those of Donat (1975) who also found Eumida bifoliata and
Eulalia aviculiseta to be the most abundant phyllodocids in the Phyllo-
chaetopterus community.Worms found in tubes were almost always found in
loose pieces or side branches (30-200 mm long) which were otherwise
empty. Two forms of Eumida bifoliata were found, one with an irridescent
white peristomium and another with the peristomium colored the same as
the rest of the body segments (see Donat, 1975).Worms with the white
peristomium outnumbered the other form 9:1.Both forms were found in-
habiting tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica as well as crawling freely
among them.
Three specimens of another species of phyllodocid, Eulalia avic¬
uliseta were also found inside the tubes.The frequencies with which
phyllodocids were found inhabiting tubes are shown in Fig. 3.According
to Brandt and Snedecor's method for multiple percentages there was a
