and then withdrew into it.In doing so,mucus was accumulated at the tip
of the tube.The worm usually proceeded to walk backward on the neuro¬
podial setae and contract swiftly to a position 1-2 cm from the end
of the tube.This contraction set up a momentary swift current through
the tube and was usually followed by a period of pumping.
Mucus structures were consistently seen inside both plastic and
glass tubes but their geometry was hard to determine.The walls were
almost always lined with a thin layer of mucus and there was often an
additional structure running lengthwise down the center of the tube.
This structure appeared sheet-like or in some cases funnel shaped when
stained with carmine.
All worms spent most of their time within 1-2 cm of either end of
their tubes.They were active and agile inside the tubes and turned
around every 5-10 minutes.This was accomplished by bending the head
backward and walking on the neuropodial setae.After turning the worms
sometimes moved to the opposite end of the tube.
Other stereotyped behavior involved what seemed to be the main-
tenance of an unobstructed passageway through the mucus ball to the
outside of the tube.At intervals of 5-30 minutes the worms moved to the
tip of the tube and extended segments 1-5 through the mucus, This was
followed by a retraction during which water and suspended particles were
seen to flow freely into the tube.Occassionally the tail was seen to
perform this function.
Defecation was observed only once.In this instance the worm ex¬
tended the last 7-10 segments from the tube and a dark, threadlike fecal
pellet was expelled a distance of about 1 cm from the anus.
Fecal pellets collected from the water in the fingerbowl contained
