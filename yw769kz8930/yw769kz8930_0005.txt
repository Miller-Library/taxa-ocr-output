in and among Phyllochaetopterus tubes

of more than 20 worms.Behavior did not vary noticeably with the type of
tube used aside from the fact that worms in larger diameter tubes
(1.3-1.6 mm) appeared short and tumid while those in narrower tubes were
necessarily more elongated and thinner.
All worms set up a water current through the tube by means of dorso¬
ventral undulations originating in the anterior third of the body and
traveling posteriorly.From the side view this wave was asymmetrical,
the leading edge being slightly steeper than the trailing edge (Fig. 5).
as the leading edge of the wave approached a given segment,the setae
of that segment were braced against the side of the tube.As the peak of
the wave passed,the dorsum was pressed against the top of the tube and
the setae were fully extended.As the wave passed,the setae withdrew and the
segment resumed its original position (Fig. 5).The frequency of this
pumping ranged from 12-22 min with an average of 18.2 min (n=20).In
many cases the pumping was continuous for periods of up to 45 min. and
it was never seen to stop for periods longer than about 2-3 minutes.
Particles were sucked into the tubes from as far away as 2 mm when the
worms pumped;these could be seen passing through both plastic and glass
tubes.The rate of flow of these particles through the tubes varied from
207 cm/sec to .15 cm/sec with an average of .10 cm/sec (based on 63
observations of 7 worms).Water was seen to pass over both the dorsal and
ventral surfaces.
Another conspicuous behavior involved the accumulation of a mucus
ball at one or both ends of the tube.Soon after a worm was placed inside a
tube it moved to one end
and extended the anterior 6-25 segments from the
tube.The setae of these segments were then alternately protruded and with¬
drawn.Mucus was secreted and held away from the body by the tips of
the setae.The worm remained extended from the tube for 15-60 seconds
and then withdrew into it.
