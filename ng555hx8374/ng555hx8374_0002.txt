INTRODUCTION
Although the excretory products of many crustaceans
have been analysed and compared, Pagurus have received
little study. Preliminary work revealed a large amount of
urea in the excretory products of hermit crabs. This find-
ing was unexpected, since most other crustaceans excrete
ammonia as the principal product of nitrogen metabolism.
A more complete investigation was undertaken to confirm the
preliminary study.
METHODS
Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1859) and Pagurus grano-
simanus (Stimpson, 1859) were collected from the area around
Point Pinos, the southern and most western tip of Monterey
Bay, California. These crabs were brought into the laboratory
and placed in small (30 ml.) beakers containing 15 ml. of sea
water. The sea water was treated with antibiotics to prevent
the growth of bacteria and decomposition of the nitrogenous
waste products. Terramycin (oxytetracycline; intravenous;
Chas. Pfizer and Co., Inc., New York) and streptomycin sul-
fate (Eli Lilly and Gompany, Indianapolis) were used. The
beakers were covered with cheesecloth to prevent the escape
