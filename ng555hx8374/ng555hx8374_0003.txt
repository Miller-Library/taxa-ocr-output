of the crabs and maintained at 15° C. for 12-18 hours. At
the end of this time the crabs were removed, and the sample
of excretory water was frozen-ferolater analysisater.
The samples to be analysed were removed from the freezer
and centrifuged to remove fecal pellets. A 12.5 ml. volume
of the sample was then treated bytpassage through a 5 ml.
column of Dowex 50Wx 8, in the sodium form, to remove most
of the divalent cations present in the sea water. These
cations precipitate on Nesslerization. The column was then
washed with distilled water to a final volume of 25 ml.
Total nitrogen, ammonia, urea, allantoic acid, and allan-
toin were measured as ammonia by Nesslerization with or
without preliminary treatment. Allantoin was cõnverted toi
allantoic acid bytbasicahydrolysisnandathe allantoic acid
to urea by acid hydrolysis. Urease solution prepared from
urease tablets (Matheson, Coleman, and Bell) was used to
convert urea to ammonia. Distillation of the ammonia
was finally resorted to because of various precipitates that
formed upon Nesslerization. Urease, allantoin, and allantoic
acid were found to precipitate to various degrees with the
Nesslers Reagent. The distillate was collected in 1 ml. of
