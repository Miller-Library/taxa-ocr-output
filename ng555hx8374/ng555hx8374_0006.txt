DISCUSSION
Pagurus samuelis and P. granosimanus seem to follow
the pattern set by other crustaceans, i.e. they are
ammonotelic, the principal waste product of nitrogen metab-
olism being ammonia. (See Waterman, and Prosser et al).
The presence of large amounts of urea excreted by some of
the crabs was a surprising result and is a deviation from
the norm established by other members of the class. This
fact suggests more extensive study to determine the extent
of these large excretions of urea in other Pagurids of the
same and different species. If this trend continues, espec-
ially in species of the upper intertidal, it could indicate
that a least one of the necessary metabolic adaptations for
a more terrestrial way of life is possible in this group of
crabs.
