value was compared to a standard curve.
Uric acid was determined by the method of Folini(1930).
RESULTS
The amounts of the various products of nitrogen ex-
cretion are presented in Table 1. While ammonia was the
principal compound excreted from all the crabs tested,
substantial amounts of other nitrogenous wastes were found.
The results suggest the mechanism for dealing with excess
purines is through a total conversion to NH.. Most of the
intermediates in the mmetabolic series for the degradation
of purines are found to some extent in the excretory water of
these animals. The amount of urea excreted showed great
variation; it was an important product excreted by somgcrabs
and was absent from the excretroy water of others. No marked
difference in the excretory products of the two species was
detected.
