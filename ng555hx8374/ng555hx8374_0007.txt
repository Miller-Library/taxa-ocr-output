SUMMARY
While ammonia was found to be the principal nitrog-
enous excretory product of Pagurus samuelis and
P. granosimanus, substantial amounts of urea,
allantoic acid, and allantoin were also detected.
Small amounts of uric acid are also excreted.
2. Individual crabs showed considerable variation in the
amounts of the various nitrogenous compounds excreted.
3. No difference in excretory products was observed be-
tween the species tested.
