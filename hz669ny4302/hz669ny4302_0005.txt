MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiment A
The experiment was conducted in the Elkhorn Slough in Watsonville,
California. The research area was located in a mudflat area north of the area
known locally as 'the Island.“ The area has a gentle slope which is high on
the edges and in the middle, forming a shallow depression that is rarely
exposed. The area is exposed to direct sunlight throughout the day. The
edge of the selected area is surrounded by a dense patch of pickleweed, and
Badllaria were observed in the midst of the patches. Eighteen plots were
haphazardly selected throughout the study site and were randomly assigned
one of three experimental conditions. Six plots were used as controis and
were marked off at the corners with dowels as a 20 cm by 20 cm area. Six
plots were experimental cages (also 20 cm x 20 cm) with screen wrapped
around four dowels at the corners. The screen was 10 cm high and was
submerged 2 cm into the sediment to prevent the snails from burrowing
underneath the exclosures. Six plots were used as controls for the effects of
cage materials and structure, with two sides bordered with screen and two
sides exposed to let the snails enter and exit freely. Three of these cages
were set up parallel to the incoming tide, and three of them were set up
perpendicular. Ten samples of sediment were collected throughout the
eighteen plots to get an estimate of the chlorophyll concentration in the area
After twelve days there was a noticeable layer of film inside the exclosure
cages and also within some of the cage controls. A 3.5 cm in diameter
sample of the top centimeter of sediment was collected in the center of each
plot. These samples were brought back to the lab and transferred to new
containers. 11 mL of acetone were added to each vial, and the sediments
were kept in darkness in the 4° Celcius room for 48 hours. One mL of
