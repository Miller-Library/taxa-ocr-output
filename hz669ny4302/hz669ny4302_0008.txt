possible differences between treatments were obscured. The reasons for
such variation are unknown, since the patchy environment did not appear to
follow any pattern or gradient that would explain the differences in
chlorophyll a concentration. As a result, it can not be asserted that the
exclosure condition either had an effect or did not have an effect.
The samples from the center of plots were consistently lower than the
side averages. This observation suggests a possible edge effect due to the
actual cage structure. There might have been water current alterations due
to the physical obstruction of the cage that encouraged diatom productivity
in certain areas around the edge of the plot. Such observations might also
have been due to some impact of the cages on the snail populations. These
results are somewhat unexpected since the shade provided by the cage walls
reduced the sunlight reaching the diatoms around the edge of the plots. This
was not the case in the control plots since there were no walls constructed
but was a factor only for the cage controls and the experimental plots.
Further investigation of the variation within the mudflat might help to
sort out the differences between the environmental variation and changes
due to the experimental conditions. Daily counts of the snails within the
xperimental plots and frequent collection of sediment would give a more
exact view of the day to day conditions in the area. From these data, trends
might emerge which would link the snail fluctuations with varying
chlorophyll a concentrations. Snail enclosures could also be established
which would maintain fixed densities within the plots. From this test, the
effect of fluctuating snail population would be controlled. In addition, the
density of snails could be varied to determine whether low populations of
snails improve the productivity of diatoms by stirring up nutrients beneath
the surface of the sediment and increasing nutrient cycling
