RESULTS
Experiment A
Figure 1 shows the difference in chlorophyll a concentration between
the initial samples and those collected after the experiment continued for a
period of seven days. In all cases, the error bars show that there is no
observable heterogeneity between the three treatments. Figure 2 displays
the fluctuation of the average snail counts through time. Table 1 shows the
actual values within the different plots and demonstrates the erratic snail
numbers within single plots. Figures 3 through 5 show that variation within
the plots also was not heterogeneous. A comparison of average chlorophyll a
concentrations between samples taken at the center of the plots to samples
taken on the side edges shows no observable difference between the three
treatments. The average center trends were all lower than the average side
trends.
Experiment B
The snails that were introduced into the sparsely populated mudflat
area all disappeared after two days. None were recovered, and subsequent
observations of the area revealed no snails, either living or dead.
DISCUSSION
The spatial and temporal variation within the mudflat environment
was unpredictable and highly fluctuating. The results show that the snail
populations between and among plots differed greatly and that the
chlorophyll concentrations were not noticeably correlated with these
variations. The fluctuations within the treatments were so large that any
