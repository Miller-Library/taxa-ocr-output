Fatillaria live in close association with the oyster, Gassostrea gigas
(Thunberg, 1793). The first evidence of an established population of the
snail was in 1951 (McLean 1960). There are currently two locations where
such snail populations have been found in the state of California: one in
Tomales Bay and the other in Elkhorn Slough. Preliminary studies on
reproduction suggest that the snails have no pelagic stage in their life cycle,
thus minimizing their dispersal ability. This information could be important
in explaining the reason for their lack of expansion past the areas where
they were introduced, despite suitable habitat availability.
Batillaria are found in numbers exceeding 300 per square meter and
are capable moving up to twenty meters in a month. Intestinal analysis has
suggested that their main sources of food are benthic diatoms (Whitlatch and
Obrebski 1980). As a result this species is capable of greatly impacting the
environment into which it has been introduced. The populations are
typically found in mudflats and marsh creeks where there is a high
concentration of diatoms. Elkhorn Slough does not support any native
mudflat snails so Batillaria is the only gastropod present that feeds on
benthic diatoms. Therefore, the introduction of this species could have a
dramatic impact on the distribution and productivity of the diatoms that
they feed upon. This is an experimental study of the grazing effects of
Batillaria attramentaria on the mudflat ecosystem, using chlorophyll a
