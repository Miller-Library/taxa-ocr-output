Determining the actual diatom species composition within the
different experimental conditions would help to discover the species that the
snails are digesting. The experimental plots might have low concentrations
of diatoms that the snails are feeding on, while other species are
compensating for this gap by increasing their productivity. If this were
observed, then the snails would be altering the competitive interactions
among the various diatom species. This effect would not be observable in
basic chlorophyll a measurements, but microscopy analysis would make such
differences obvious.
The effects of introduced species to the rocky intertidal zone are often
quite obvious and straightforward (Lubchenco and Menge 1978). The
intertidal zone is a harsh environment and has, therefore, developed a
complex network of interactions among the native species living there. As a
result, the successful invasion of an alien species is more likely to have a
profound effect on the structuring of the intertidal ecosystem. Nutrient
supplies are unpredictable, and species often develop highly specific habitat
requirements which are easily disrupted by the introduction of a new
species. The soft-sediment environment, while a more abundant type of
Ã©cosystem, is much less understood and not as well studied. The conditions
that the species in the soft-sediment must overcome are vastly different
from the challenges of the rocky intertidal. Therefore, the impacts of
invasion species in the mudflat can not necessarily be assumed the same as
the impacts in the intertidal zone. As a result the spatial and temporal
variation within this environment must be studied and understood before
such impacts can be determined.
The results from the transplant experiment further emphasize the
high variability within the Elkhorn Slough ecosystem. Not only is there high
