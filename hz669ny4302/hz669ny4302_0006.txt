solution was removed from each sample and placed in a microfuge tube. The
samples were centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the absorbance of
chlorophyll a was measured with a spectrophotometer. The wavelength
readings were collected at the following: 664.0 nm, 647.0 nm, 630.0 nm.
Eight days later I collected two samples from each of the cages, one
from the center of the plot and the other on the side. At the same time
another set of eighteen plots were constructed nearby as a replication of
the first experiment. Seven days following the start of the second
replication, sediments were collected from both sets of plots. The above
s√©diment analysis was repeated on each of the samples in the laboratory.
Data analysis
The chlorophyll a concentration was computed by the following
equation (Hansmann 1983):
chlorophyll a (ug/mL) =11.85 (664) -1.54 (D647) - 0.08 (D630).
Experiment B
A similar area of mudflat was discovered close to the study site of
experiment. Careful searching revealed seven living specimens of Batillaria
scattered over an area comparable in size to the study site where there were
hundreds of thousands of snails. In order to try to elucidate the reason for
the low numbers of snails, 35 snails were marked, and a notch was made in
the shell in order to keep track of shell growth. Specimens were notched
and returned to the mudflat used in experiment as a control for snail
growth.
