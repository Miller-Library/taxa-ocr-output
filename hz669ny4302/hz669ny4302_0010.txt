variation within a single mudflat region, but the disappearance of all the
snails when transferred to a seemingly analogous environment suggests high
variability on a larger scale.
The introduction of Batillaria attramentaria into Elkhorn Slough made
it the first mudflat-grazing gastropod in the marsh. As a result there was no
direct competition between this species and another closely related species.
The snails were quite successful in the mudflat, with an average population
of 350 m-2. This success suggests that there was possibly an available niche
to be filled by this snail. However, this indication can not be accepted with
any certainty since the actual effect of the snails on the rest of the ecosystem
could not be determined. The diatoms have obviously not been decimated
by the snails, and it is possible that the snails actually encourage diatom
productivity. Some research suggests that mud snails stir up the sediment
and increase nutrient cycling (Connor, et al. 1982). The effect of Batillaria
in Elkhorn Slough has not been determined and must be investigated
further. Future studies on the effects of grazing must focus on the
population dynamics of the diatoms. The effects of varying light conditions,
salinity, tides, and sediment content all need to be addressed.
ACKHOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Dennis Powers for being my advisor. Special
thanks goes to Jon Gellar for his helpful advice and suggestions. Without his
aid, my project might not have gotten off the ground.
