species composition, suggested that, 'the greatest agency of all that spreads
marine animals to new quarters of the world must be the business of oyster
culture" (Elton 1958).
Introduced species have been demonstrated to have a profound effect
on the ecosystems which they invade. Such species can cause alterations in
nutrient and water cycles (Egunjobi and Onweluzo 1979, Weetman, et al.
1980), frequency of natural disturbances such as floods and fires (Smith
1985), and soil structure (Hodgkin 1984). Vitousek (1986) has concluded
that individual species can have a profound effect on the ecosystems that
they invade.
The role of grazers in the structure of intertidal and benthic
communities has been studied in a number of organiems. Grazing herbivores
such as gastropods and polychaete worms primarily affect the succession
and species composition of the microflora (Bianchi and Rice 1988). This
effect has been shown to be especially apparent in the rocky intertidal zone
(Lubchenco 1978). Even though invasions in soft-sediment marine
communities are much more common, they are not well understood. The
physical environment is highly variable and is, therefore, much more
difficult to study (Wilson 1991). Laboratory studies suggest that grazing at
Ã  minimal level may actually have a positive effect on benthic diatom
populations, while larger grazing pressure results in a suppression of algal
productivity (Connor, et al. 1982). This stimulation may be the result of
stirring of the sediments and thus revealing increased nutrients to surface
species.
The mud snail, Batillaria attramentaria (Sowerby), was introduced to
North America as early as 1923 (Whitlatch and Obrebski 1980). The species
is native to Japan and was accidentally brought through the oyster farming
