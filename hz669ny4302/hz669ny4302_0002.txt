ABSTRACT
The impact of the introduced mudflat grazer, Badillaris attramentaria
on the ecosystem in Elkhorn Slough was studied by building cages to exclude
the snails from plots of sediment. Sediment samples were collected from the
exclosures and from controls areas where snails were present. These
samples were then analyzed for chlorophyll a concentration as a measure of
diatom productivity. The high variation within the environment, both
spatially and temporally, obscured the effects of the snails. Therefore, the
population dynamics of the diatoms must first be elucidated before the
effects of the snails can be determined.
INTRODUCTION
For centuries humans have played a key role in facilitating the spread
of numerous alien species to new environments throughout the world. Many
of the terrestrial introductions were preconceived for the alteration of an
ecosystem. Exotic marine organisme, however, have usually been
inadvertently transported by various means. Wooden ships were ideal
environments for the transfer of species of anemones, barnacles, mollusks,
algae, snails, and other rugged organisms that could survive harch conditions
(Cariton 1989). Ballast water was also an important means by which alien
species were introduced thousands of miles away. When a ship completed a
journey, the ballast water would be pumped into the new harbor. The
emergence of commercial oyster farming played a key role in the invasion
by species closely associated with the oysters. Charles Elton, one of the first
scientists to become concerned about the homogenization of the earth's
