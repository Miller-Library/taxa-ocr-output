According to Schroeder, a normal human intake of cadmium is 215 ug/ day
(Nilsson, 1969). Of this, 984 is excreted. Of the 24 retained, most is stored
in the kidneys and liver. Bowen (1966) indicated that 3mg of cadmium ingested
per day is "toxic" to humans. In order to achieve such an intake of cadmium
per day, one would have to eat 1Â½ pounds of Bent-nosed clams or 17 whole
oysters from Elkhorn Slough. Likewise, 84 pounds of scallop muscles from
San Pedro Harbor, or 174 pounds of Swordfish steak would account for such
a quantity of cadmium. (These amounts were calculated from the cadmium
concentrations in ppm wet weight.)
