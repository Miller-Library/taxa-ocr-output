by adding 90% nitric acid and heating in acid-cleaned 30ml Pyrex beakers.
Drops of capryl alcohol were added to minimize foaming where necessary,
(as in Middleton and Stuckey, 1953). Blanks were treated exactly as the
marine samples. Once the tissues were in solution, they were heated until
charred, on hot plates, in order to burn off lipid particles. Samples
were cooled, redisolved with 90% nitric acid, and cleared by adding
hydrogen peroxide dropwise with heat. Once clear, samples were diluted with
distilled water, covered, and analyzed within 3 days. Samples were analyzed
for metal concentrations by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 303),
using a triple slot burner head. The detection limits for cadmium, copper,
and manganese were 0.05 ug/g dry weight, and for zinc was 0.5 ug/g dry weight.
Results & Discussion
Tables of the results indicate the common and scientific names of
samples, which samples were disected, and which samples were analyzed whole
(since they are eaten whole). The right hand column of the tables lists the
dry to wet weight ratio. Multiplication of this value by the dry parts per
million (ppm or ug/g) figures gives the values for ppm wet weight.
Metals were clearly concentrated in bivalve mollusks of all species.
The highest concentrations were found in the heart, gills and visceral mass
of individual animals. The clams tended to concentrated the metals to a
lesser degree than did the non-siphoned bivalves, i.e. the scallop, oysters,
and mussels, in every case except for the Bent-nosed clams. Three Bent-nosed
clams (Nacoma nasuta) from Elkhorn Slough averaged 30 ppm dry weight of cadmium
and 1,076 ppm dry weight of zinc (See Table 1). This particularly hardy
