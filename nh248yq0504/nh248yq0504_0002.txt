Introduction
In light of the recent concern over contamination and toxicity of
cadmium (Nilsson, 1969), (Schroeder, et al, 1966, 1967, 1968), (Pringle, 1968),
an examination of cadmium, zinc, copper, and manganese concentrations in the
edible portions of bivalve mollusks, 10 species of fish, and 3 species of
crustaceans was undertaken. Particular attention was given to the soft
bodies and organs of the mollusks since other workers have reported that
they concentrate trace metals (Schroeder, 1967), (Brooks and Rumsby, 1965),
(Pringle, 1968).
Six species of mollusks and 2 species of fish were collected from
Elkhorn Slough, which flows into Monterey Bay near Moss Landing, California.
This area is particularly abundant in estuarine animals although it has
been condemned by the county health department as a health hazard due to
high E.coli counts. It is also the receptor of both the Pacific Gas & Electric
generator plant and the Kaiser Aluminum plant waste water effluents. No
attempt was made to determine the metal contents of the effluents. Accord-
ing to Veith (1971), Monterey Bay sewage effluents pour as much as 175 grams
of cadmium into the Bay per day.
Methods
Mollusks were collected and removed from shells, rinsed with dis-
tilled water and disected (where applicable). Fish and crustacean samples were
purchased at local fish markets. All samples were weighed, dried for about
12 hours at 1000C and reweighed. Digestion of dried material was accomplished
55.
