species of clam has a separated siphon which acts as a "vacuum cleaner"
combing the surface of the slough bottom.
Whole oysters, and especially Ostrea lurida from San Francisco Bay,
were noted to have high concentrations of zinc (900 ppm dry) and copper
(173 ppm dry) (See Table 2). The nephridium of one scallop (Hinnites multi-
rugosus) taken from San Pedro Harbor in Los Angeles, contained the highest
cadmium level of the study (181 ppm dry) (See Table 4). Interestingly enough,
the nephridium corresponds in function to the mammalian kidneys, which are
also the site of cadmium concentration (Schroeder, 1967).
Although the Gaper clams (Tresus nuttalli) from Elkhorn Slough, had
low metal concentrations, the outer skin, covering the neck was found to
have the highest manganese content (1,200 ppm dry) (See Table 5). Since
manganese is a common metal component of sediments, it is possible that
the sample of neck skin included some clay particles, although it was thor-
oughly washed. Unfortunately a substrate analysis of the Slough sediment was
not taken.
Although cadmium values in fish flesh were relatively low,(less than
1.5 ppm dry) Swordfish and Salmon contained more cadmium than the crustaceans
and edible portions of the Gaper clam (Table 6).
The figures presented here should not be considered as representitive for
species from the entire Pacific Coast. Note, for example, that the cadmium
concentration was 5 times higher in Littleneck clams (Protothaca staminea)
from Elkhorn Slough than those from Canada (See Table 1).
