Legend for Graph 1
The following bar graph represents cadmium concentrations in
weight of edible samples. In the cases where the whole animal (shell-less)
is eaten, such as the smaller clams and oysters, whole body concentrations
are depicted. Samples listed as "ND" are the cleaned edible portions in
which the metal concentration was below the detection limit.
Tables i through 7 list the genus species names of the animals examined
along with the ppm dry weight values and the dry/wet weight ratios.
