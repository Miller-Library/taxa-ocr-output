Trace metal analysis of 23 species of common Pacific Coast marine
foods revealed high cadmium values for Bent-nosed clams (Macoma nasuta),
Bay mussels (Mytilus edulis), Bay oysters (Ostrea lurida), Pacific oysters
(Crassostrea gigas), and Littleneck clams (Protothaca staminea). Metals
were found to concentrate in the gills, heart, and visceral mass of all
10 species of bivalve mollusks examined. Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and
Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) demonstrated the highest cadmium values
for fish flesh.
