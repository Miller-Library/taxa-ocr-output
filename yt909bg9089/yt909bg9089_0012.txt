Attempts to locate developing embryos in the field have met with little
success. In the tide pools and splash pools, eggs were found in all stages of
development up to the presence of moving cilia. This corresponds to just over
two days of development at room temperature. Most of the eggs recovered from
these pools had begun to lose their characteristic pinkish hue, and looked to be
inviable. This suggests that eggs which remain in the higher rock pools are
subject to ecological pressures which prevent their complete development. Such
pressures might include increased salinity due to evaporation, or the presence of
predators which could conceivably feed on the developing eggs as they lay quiescent
on the pool bottoms. Surface plankton collected from the open sea a few feet from
the rocky shore yielded a single veliger which resembled the larva of L. planaxis
or L. scutulata.
On the basis of these field observations, it appears that the eggs of
L. planaxis and L. scutulata must somehow attain the open sea. It is possible
that these species may be induced to spaun during periods of wave action, when the
possibility that the eggs will reach the sea is greatest. After a period of
pelagic development, the veligers may settle on rocks in the low intertidal and
assume the crawling mode of life.
