sand-filtered seawater. Oxygen readings were taken at intervals of
thirty minutes for four and a half hours. The rate of oxygen
depletion in grams per hour was determined by the following
calculation:
1.umles/liter0.5733timeu 541 r-
0.984). The slope of this regression (-0.5733
umoles/ liter/hour) is the rate of total consumption.

3. For a given cottid biomass: go, consumed/hour/g
cottid.
The percent of oxygen consumed by cottids in an actual
tidepool was calculated as follows:
1. g 0, consumed/hour/g cottid' g cottid in pool
time interval between readings - g 0, consumed
by cottids.
