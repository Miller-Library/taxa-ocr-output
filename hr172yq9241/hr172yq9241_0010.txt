in about the same range (3.1-5.1 cm).
The mean mass does not differ significantly (p»»0.05)
between species (Figure 4). The range in mass for C analis is
again much greater than O snyderi and the range in mass for the
middle 70% of O. snyderi (0.5-1.3 g) falls in the lower part of the
range for the middle 702 of C. analis (0.4-1.8 g).
All of the single linear regressions for tidepool parameters
were calculated to determine any independent correlations
between parameters. Many were not significant, but two show
significant correlations. Mean cottid length per tidepool tends to
increase with tidepool volume (Figure 5). The total number of
cottid per tidepool tends to decrease with the height of the
tidepool (Figure 6).
SECTION TWO: PHYSICAL FACTORS
The results of the two multiple regressions calculated are
summarized in Table 2. Mean oxygen level seems to be the most
important variable affecting both the cottid mass/pool volume
and the number of cottids per tidepool, but it appears to be more
closely correlated to mass/pool volume. Figure 7 illustrates the
independent relationship between the mean oxygen level and the
mass of fish/volume of a tidepool.
In Figure 8, the percent of oxygen consumed by cottids in
