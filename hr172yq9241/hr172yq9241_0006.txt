osmometer. The mean level for each of these parameters was
calculated from the readings taken when the pools were not
inundated with fresh seawater.
Possible relationships between the different parameters for
the tidepools were determined using a linear regression technique.
Single regressions were done to examine the correlation between
two parameters independently from the remaining parameters; a
correlation was considered significant when the R value was
significant at the 0.05 level. The SPSS multiple regression
program was used to determine the independent variables which
most significantly affect one dependent variable. Variables
included: volume, surface area, height, mean oxygen level, mean
temperature, mean phl, mean salinity, number of cottid per pool.
mass of cottid per pool, mean length of cottid per pool, and the
mass of fish/pool volume. One multiple regression was calculated
with number of fish per tidepool as the dependent variable, and
the other with cottid mass per pool volume as the dependent
variable. The relative importance of the independent variables
was determined by examination of the significance of the T test in
the regression output; only variables which produced a significance
greater than or equal to 0.05 were considered in the equation.
The rate of oxygen consumption by the representative
organisms in a tidepool was determined experimentally. 59.54
grams of C analis were placed in a fourteen-liter tank of
