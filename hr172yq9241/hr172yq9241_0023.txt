Figure 7. Mean oxygen level versus cottid mass/volume.
Figure 8. Cottid biomass per pool volume versus 2 oxygen consumed
by cottid. The circles represent oxygen consumed at night, and the
squares represent consumption during the day . The equation of the
curve is approximated by: LENGTH - 0.0023 * MASS/VOL 1.47 (R2 -
0.987, p «0.001) where 0» is expressed in grams.
Figure 9. Cottid recruitment. The initial level represents the amount
of cottid mass found in the initial census of the tidepool studied.
