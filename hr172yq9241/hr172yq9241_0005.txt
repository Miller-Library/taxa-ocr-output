the tidepool in which they were captured. Fish from three
tidepools were kept in the lab so that a recruitment study could be
conducted.
Recruitment was measured in two tidepools. Each was
emptied of cottids when initially censused (May 12, 1989 and May
15, 1989), and subsequent habitation was followed daily and
continued through June 1. 1989. A daily lowtide census was taken
for each pool by capturing fishes with a dipnet, measuring their
length, and determining their species. To reduce the amount of
disturbance, fish were returned to the tidepools immediately
following the census, and no carbon dioxide was used to
anesthetize the fish. The lengths of the fish were converted to
mass by using the empirically determined regression of the log of
cottid length (cm) to the log of cottid mass (grams): LENGTH -
0.0098 * MASS3.10 (R2 - 0.962, p « 0.001), calculated from the
length and mass of each cottid found in the fifteen tidepools
originally censused. The total biomass of fish found at each census
was calculated by adding the single cottid masses.
Physical data were taken for six of the fifteen tidepools;
readings were taken at low, mid, and high tides over a period of
two days (May 1, 1989 to May 3, 1989). Dissolved oxygen and
temperature were measured with a YSI meter (model 54), pH was
measured with a Markson digital pH meter (model 90), and
sälinity was determined by a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure
