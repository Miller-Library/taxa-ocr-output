Figure 1. Clinocottus analis and Oligocottus snyderi. Bolin, 1944.
pp.125 and 127.
Figure 2. Species of sample population.
Figure 3. Length description of sample cottid population. The range
in lengths for the overall cottid population. C. analis and Q. snyderi
are shown by a bar graph, and the mean lengths for each catagory are
represented with a horizontal line. The shaded portion represents the
middle 704 of each population. The value 702 was chosen because
the Osnyderi population is composed of only seven fish; one fish was
removed from the upper and lower limits.
Figure 4. Mass description of sample cottid population. The upper
and lower limits for the O snyderi population were removed to shoy
the middle 702 of the population (shaded area) and this value was
used in the other populations also.
Figure 5. Tidepool volume versus mean cottid length. The regression
equation and its significance is shown.
Figure 6. Tidepool height versus number of cottid. The regression
equation and its significance is shown.
