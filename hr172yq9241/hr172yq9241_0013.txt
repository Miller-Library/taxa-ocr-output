Although the most stressful time for tidepool fishes in
terms of oxygen availability is probably during the night between
high tides, because algae are respiring and the pools are not
receiving fresh water, it is difficult to state in the context of this
study whether oxygen is the limiting factor for the amount of fish
biomass that occurs in a certain tidepool. Regardless of the fact
that algae and invertebrates use much more of the total oxygen
overnight than cottids, oxygen levels in the tidepools where
these fish reside might never drop to dangerous levels before
they are replenished with fresh sea water or sunlight for
photosynthesis. Further experimental studies are needed to
settle this question.
In the observed tidepool, algae is apparently the primary
oxygen consumer by quite a large margin. If oxygen is in fact a
significant limiting factor, then an interesting situation occurs,
Algae provide an advantage for the fish as a means of protection
from predators, but it also might provide a disadvantage by using
large amounts of oxygen and possibly leaving the cottid with a
less than ideal oxygen level.
The above calculations for oxygen consumption in the
observed tidepool were made using the fish biomass / pool volume
of the unmanipulated pool. This biomass was equal to was the
initial level of this pool while it was used in the recruitment
study. Over the course of this study, biomass reached a
