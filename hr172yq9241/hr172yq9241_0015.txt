cottids illustrates that there are tidepools that are probably
difficult for cottids to reach physically. Those pools which only
get splashed occasionally due to their distance from the ocean are
not only difficult to encounter, but may also have characteristics
which are detrimental to tidepool fishes. For instance, one
tidepool in the study area (which contained no fish) receives
fresh seawater only at the highest tides when a large wave sends
water through a small channel to the pool. Not only is the salinity
of this pool higher than that of regular seawater, but algae
growth is poor and the diversity of other organisms is relatively
limited.
Finally, the two species of cottid found in this census did
not reside in the same tidepools. In the context of competition
among similar species, this might suggest that, instead of sharing
the resources in the same tidepool by using them at different
times or by using separate resources (Yoshiyama 1977), these
fishes are simply not residing in the same space. Another
possibility, however, is that the environment affects these species
in different ways. According to Nakamura (1976), O. snyderi
have a lower tolerance of wide temperature extremes than other
cottid species. The fact that the six of the seven Q. snyderi found
in this study area were residing in a tidepool that was almost
always receiving fresh ocean water and had the smallest
temperature range over a tide cycle supports the possibility that
