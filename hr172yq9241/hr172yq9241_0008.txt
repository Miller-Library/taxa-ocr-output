2. difference between initial and final oxygen
readings umoles/liter * 32 ug/umole * 1 g/10° ug
10°liters/m2 * m2 of tidepool - total g0 consumed
in tide pool.
3. g 0 consumed by cottid/g 0» consumed in
tidepool' 100 - percent of 0, consumed by cottids.
In order to eliminate the complicated effects of
photosynthesis on oxygen consumption, oxygen readings taken at
the beginning and end of one night (3:24pm May 3, 1989 and
4.30am May 4, 1989) were used in the calculations above to
détermine the amount of oxygen consumed by cottids in six
tidepools.
A similar experimental design was used to determine the
oxygen consumption of invertebrates and algae in one of the six
tidepools used in the cottid experiment. The experimental
biomasses were 642.6 grams of invertebrates and 333.1 grams of
algae (Appendix 1). Two, twenty-liter tanks were used, and
readings were taken every three hours for a twelve hour period.
The regression equations for oxygen consumption were
02lumoles/liter - 7.22-0.48333'timehours (R2 - 0.896, p « 0.05)
