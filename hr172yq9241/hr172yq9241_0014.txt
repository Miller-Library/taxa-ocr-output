maximum of almost exactly this level before dropping again and
remaining quite low. (Figure 9). This information poses the
question of whether there exists a maximum for cottid biomass in
tidepools in relation to the amount of oxygen available to the fish.
Determining whether different cottid species consume oxygen at
significantly different rates and investigating the occurance of
these species in tidepools with varying amounts of algae would
be useful to answer this question. Further areas of investigation
might include what, if any, mechanism the fish have to detect
such a limit and whether fish are distributed accordingly,
Other correlations between different tidepool parameters
suggest possibilities for explaining the distribution of tidepool
fishes. For example, the positive correlation between tidepool
volume and mean cottid length might be another possible
illustration of the distribution of cottids according to some
limiting factor. Cottid length is related to biomass by the
equation LENGTH - 0.0098 * MASS 3.10. This regression includes
only those pools which contain cottid, which tended to be richer
in algae and invertebrate diversity than those without fish (Table
1). In similar pools, the bigger the pool the more resources it
contains. It follows that larger fish could reside in larger pools.
Included in this explanation of where tidepool fishes occur
is the question of where they do not occur in the intertidal zone,
