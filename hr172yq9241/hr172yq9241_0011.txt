six tidepools is shown in relation to the cottid mass / pool volume
of those pools. This relationship is approximated by the equation:
« 02 - 0.0023 * MASS/VOLI.47 (r2 - 0.987. p « 0.001) where
oxygen is expressed in grams. The values for cottid oxygen
consumption during the day are also shown in Figure 8. Although
it appears that cottids consume less oxygen during the day, this
difference is probably due to the effects of photosynthesis on
oxygen levels.
The relative amounts of oxygen consumed by sculpins,
invertebrates, and algae during the night in one pool is shown in
Table 3. Algae were apparently the primary consumers of
oxygen; the oxygen consumed by algae was calculated to be
112.74, but this error may be due to the fact that the time points
for the calculation were from two low tides, and the tidepool was
replenished with fresh water and oxygen between those points.
The difference in overall consumption when algae is respiring in
the observed pool is probably still quite large.
SECTION THREE: RECRUITMENT STUDY
The change in total cottid biomass for one pool at daily
intervals over a fifteen day period is shown in Figure 9.
