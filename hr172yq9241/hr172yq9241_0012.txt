DISCUSSION
This study has attempted to illustrate the enormous scope
of physical and morphological characteristics of tidepools that
could affect the distribution of tidepool sculpins. Although
interaction among different organisms has been discussed in
many contexts in the past, the ways in which tidepool fishes
interact with tidepools as organisms is not well documented.
There are at least two possible scenarios to explain the
relationship that cottids have with the levels of oxygen in a
tidepool. Because the correlation between the fish mass/volume
ratio and the mean oxygen level of a tidepool is negative, a larger
amount of fish in a tidepool corresponds to a lower mean level of
oxygen. This suggests that cottids might be causing the changes in
the amount of oxygen. Alternatively, other organisms in the pool
might be more important in determining the fluctuations in
oxygen level, and this level could be a limiting factor for the fish.
This study shows that as the mass of fish in a tidepool (per pool
volume) increases, the percent of oxygen consumed by fish also
increases. But the fraction of total oxygen consumed by fish is
small and algae appears to be the primary consumer of oxygen in
a tidepool. Thus, I hypothesize that if there is causality in this
correlation, the number of fish are responding to the level of
oxygen rather than causing any change in it.
