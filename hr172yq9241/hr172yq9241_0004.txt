cottids are two interacting organisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study site at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University (36 38' N,121 56' W) consisted of fifteen tidepools
which were chosen based on the following characteristics: complete
isolation from the ocean at low tide, difference in gross
morphology, and the ease with which an investigator could
measure the physical characteristics of the pool.
The heights of the pools in relation to mean low low water
were measured using a transit.
Tidepool surface areas were
estimated by dividing the top of the pools into rough polygons and
calculating the sum of the areas of these polygons. Volumes were
measured by bailing part of the pools and siphoning the rest of the
water. A marked bucket and a 500 milliliter graduated cylinder
were used to record the amount of water actually removed from
the tidepools, and the volume of any residual was visually
estimated. The water removed was immediately replaced with
fresh water.
Carbon dioxide was bubbled through the pools for fifteen to
twenty seconds to stun fish, which were then collected with
dipnets. Fish were taken into the lab for length, mass and species
determination and, in most cases, were immediately released into
