the fishes prefer to stay in such a pool.
Because it is generally agreed that there is no single
environmental factor that causes a certain distribution of
intertidal fishes, this study has attempted to record the different
characteristics of tidepools and examine those characteristics that
appeared most important in determining where cottids were
found. The scenarios presented to explain the distribution of
cottids along the rocky intertidal zone of Hopkins Marine Station
were developed with a specific idea in mind: that tidepools might
be usefully observed as interactive organisms as well as
environments.
