ABSTRACT
This study describes the tidepool environment along the
shore of Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University and relates
it to the population and distribution of the cottid species
Clinocottus analis and Oligocottus snyderi . The relationship
between the cottid mass per tidepool volume and the percent of
oxygen consumed by cottids in a tidepool is approximated by the
equation: 202-0.0023* (mass/vol) 60/ where oxygen is expressed
in grams, but algae seems to be the primary consumer of oxygen.
It is suggested that a potential problem for fish is having algae in
the same tidepool as a means of protection and as a competing
oxygen consumer. In addition, tidepool height, volume and range
in temperature are discussed as they relate to the cottid
population.
