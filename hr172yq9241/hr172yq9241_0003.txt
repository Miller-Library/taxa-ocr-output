INTRODUCTION
Tidepool ecology is especially interesting due to the great
fluctuations in tidepool environmental factors during the course of
Ã  tide. Every time a tidepool is separated from the ocean, it is
subject to changes in temperature, oxygen levels, salinity, pH, and
the affects of different organisms that entered it during the
previous high tide. In addition, tidepools generally have a rich
diversity of species related to their small area, a situation that
could lead to potential competition for any of a number of
resources: oxygen, nutrients, food sources, space, and light. This
study raises the question; what role do these physical factors play
in determining the species composition and abundance in
tidepools?
The family cottidae (sculpins) was chosen as the subject of
this study because of the abundance of these fish in the tidepool
and nearshore areas of the California coast (Bolin, 1944 and
Eshmeyer, 1983). This study is designed to describe the cottid
population and the tidepool environment along the coast of
Hopkins Marine Station and to use this description to illustrate a
number of factors that might be affecting where cottids live. The
investigation focuses its attention on specific tidepool parameters
that provide possible explanations for the cottid distribution, and
these explanations are presented with the idea that tidepools and
