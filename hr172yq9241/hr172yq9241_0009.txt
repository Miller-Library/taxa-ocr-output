(Ré- 0.882, p - 0.05) for algae.
Further oxygen readings were taken in two pools every
hour for a seven hour period on a sunny day. Two readings per
pool were used to calculate the rate of oxygen consumption in
the pools and the percent of oxygen consumed by cottids during
the day as opposed to during the night.
RESULTS
SECTION ONE: THE POPULATION
Table 1 briefly describes tidepools in which fish were and
were not found. Two species of cottid were found in this study;
Clinocottus analis and Oligocottus snyderi (Figure 1). Of the
sixty-nine fish captured, 904 were C analis (Figure 2). Six of the
seven O. snyderi were found in the same tidepool; this tidepool
contained no C. analis
Figure 3 shows the mean lengths of the total cottid
population and of each species separately. The mean lengths do
not differ significantly (p»0.05), but C analis has a much greater
range (1.8-11.7 cm) than O. snyderi (2.6-5.1 cm). The middle
70 of the total population of cottid. C. analis, and Q snyderi fall
