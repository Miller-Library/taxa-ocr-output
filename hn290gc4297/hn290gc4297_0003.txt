Kamel, L.C.
of the relaxed anemones in an isotonic solution of mag¬
nesium chloride under a dissecting microscope. Ciliates
found in the anaesthetizing solution were removed by
eye pipette dropper and placed in sea water. The sea
water provided an adequaté culture medium for up to
four days after which ciliates tended to slow down and
die.
Structural identification studies
Examination of morphological features of Foettingeria
was done using phase microscopy of a Zeiss microscope.
Internal structures viewed using various staining
procedures were identified.
Experiments on stress tolerance to temperature and starvation
Populations of fifty ciliates each were placed in
each of 14 plastic vials containing millipore-filtered
sea water. These samples wereplaced in a bath of running
sea water at approximately 14°C to allow for temperature
equilibration. Two vials each were then placed on ice
and in water baths of 3, 9, 15, 21, 24, 30°0 for one
hour. After one hour passed, survival of the population
was estimated. Ciliates which were non-motile and showed
signs of gross structural abnormalties were judged dead.
Starvation studies were conducted with populations
of fifty ciliates each. These were placed in 4 vials
containing millipore-filtered sea water and into a water
bath maintained within + 0.2°0 of 14°0 for seven and
fourteen days. Survival was estimated and internal and
external structural changes noted.
