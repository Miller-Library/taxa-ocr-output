the ciliate is crawling along a particular substrate,
it may well be taking up particles for digestion.
The particulate dye experiments showing incorporation
of dye particles in food vacuoles is consistent with the
microscopic observation of a cytostome structure.
While pinocytosis does occur in ciliates, such as
Opalina ranarum, an opalinid protozoa found in frog
faeces (Corliss, 1955), feeding in Foettingeria
sp. appears to occur via the cytostome.
Distribution studies
From the experiments involving percent infection
of Foettingeria sp. in A. elegantissima and A. xan-
thogrammica and two other sea anemones, M. senile
and C. californica, many conclusions can be drawn.
It is possible that the difference in incidence is due
to the difference in physical factors at the collection
sites. It seems probable, however, that Foettingeria
sp. is specific to Anthopleura. In the life cycle of
F. actinarium, the ciliate encysts on a crab where it
is later ingested by a sea anemone (Lwoff, 1950). It
may well be that the ciliate encysts on an intertidal
crab taken in the die to intertidal Anthopleura.
This would be an interesting aspect for further inves-
tigation.
In the experiments investigating ciliate number
as a function of host size, it seems logical that the
number of ciliates would increase as its host size
increases. It is interesting that the number of ciliates
