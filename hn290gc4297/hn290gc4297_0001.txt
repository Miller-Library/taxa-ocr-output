ABSTRACT
Foettingeria,aciliated protozoan, is an endosymbiote
which occurs in the gastrovascular cavity of two species
of Anthopleura, a sea anemone native to the California
coast. Its population size is limited by the size of
its host.
Foettingeria sp. has two locomotion modes, swimming
and crawling. Crawling appears to be part of the foraging
mode. Feeding is done using a cytostome. The ciliate
appears to feed on tiny algal particles as well as
zooxanthellae released from the host. While it may de-
rive nourishment from mucous secretions as well as
from gut fluids, there is no evidence that Foettingeria
sp. harms its host even at high concentrations.
INTRODUCTION
The cited cases of symbiotic relationships inÂ¬
volving protozoa are well-documented (Sleight, 1973).
One association on which there is little information
is on the endosymbiosis of the ciliated protozoan
Foettingeria sp. and Anthopleura. The apostome
Foettingeria actinarium has previously been described
from various European anthozoans (Chatton and Lwoff,
1950). Based on morphological features, an undes-
cribed species of Foettingeria has been reported to
occur commonly in the coelenteron of the sea anemone
A. xanthogrammica in southern California (Ball and
Moebius, 1955).
