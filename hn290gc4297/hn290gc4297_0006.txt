Feeding behavior was observed with two particulate
dyes. Using India ink, it is observed that there is in-
corporation of the dye into specific parts of the organism,
Upon cell lysis, these dye particles are observed incorÂ¬
porated in food vacuoles.
Distribution studies
Distribution studies of Foettingeria sp. was
conducted on four different sea anemones: Anthopleura
elegantissima, both of the clonal and solitary types,
A. xanthogrammica, Metridium senile and Corynactis
californica (Figure 3). In the clonal A. elegantissima,
the rate of infection was particularly high with more than
eight out of ten animals infected with the protozoan.
The solitary A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica
did not show as high an infection rate as A.
elegantissima clones, but were infected in 58% of
the cases. In contrast, no animals of M. senile
or C. californica contained the ciliate.
In collections from the protected Agassiz Beach
and exposed West Beach of Mussel Point, a larger
number of ciliates were consistently found in A.
elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica from the more
protected area of Mussel Point (Figure 5). Foettingeria
were found throughout the gut of the anemone including
the tentacular gut extensions. These was a correlation
of the number of ciliates found in a particular host and
the size of its host (Figure 6). As host size increased.
