The eifference in the temperature tolerances of the
pigmented ciliate and the translucent ciliate could be
explained by the difference in the arease in which they
were collected, Mussel Point versus underneath Monterey
Wharf. This would argue that environmental history of
the organism might be important in stress tolerance.
Another possibility may be that the pigmented ciliate
may be more temperature-hardy due to its diet -- one
that includes zooxanthellae. A third possibility is that
these two ciliates represented are genetically different.
however the bleaching of intertidal ciliates with
starvation as well a s transplantion studies need to
be done.
The starvation studies showing bleaching of pigment
after one week and cyst formation in a small sample
after two weeks provides some interesting interpretations.
The bleaching observed may be a result of the ciliate
using up stored food sources. Encystment may be the
extreme case when these stores are depleted. Cyst
formation after two weeks indicates that Foettingeria
sp. has the capacity to form two types of cysts. The
first is a reproductive cyst already outlined in the
studies of Chatton and Lwoff (1950) involving F.
actinarium. The second described here is a protective
cyst brought on by starvation conditions. This is not
