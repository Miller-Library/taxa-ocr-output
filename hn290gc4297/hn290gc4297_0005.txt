Kamel, L.C.
The use of organelle-specific dyes has uncovered
a few internal traits of the ciliate although the
amorphous brown pigment obscures many observations.
Among the internal characteristics is the observation of
similar nuclei ranging 23-32 in number. With congo
red dye these are arranged uniformly in the ciliate.
Also present in significant numbers are mitochondria.
These appear to be 1 u across and 1 to several u in
length. Upon lysis of the plasma membrane and analysis
of internal contents, one notices the presence of food
vacuoles. In the feeding mode these vacuoles contain
partially-dissolved algal particles. In addition to
the food vacuoles, there are present in numbers too
large to quantify vessicles approximately 1 u in diameter.
It is these vessicles which contain the yellow-tan
pigment observed in the intact organism.
Swimming and feeding behavior observations
Observations of Foettingeria in millipore-filtered
sea water indicates that the protozoan tends to ex-
hibit two modes of movement, crawling and swimming.
Crawling is defined here as movement on a particular
substrate. When the protozoan is placed in a solution
of Protoslo, a viscous solution which retards movement,
the action of the cilia can be observed. The cilia move
in close waves which can be seen sweeping back over the
surface of the body as the animal swims or crawls.
The direction of movement is changed by alteration in
the direction of the beat of the cilia, which coincides
