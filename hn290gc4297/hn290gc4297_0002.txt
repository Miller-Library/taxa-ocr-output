This investigation will focus on four aspects of
Foettingeria commonly found in A. xanthogrammica and
A. elegantissima in the area around Monterey, California.
This study focused on an examination of the morphology
of the ciliated protozoan as well as certain aspects
of its biology. Locomotion and feeding were studied,
Its incidence within its host and along various
heights and exposure gradients were examined. Its
temperature tolerance range was described. Finally.
an attempt was made to describe the nature of the
observed symbiosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of anemones for field studies
Sea anemones were collected by hand using a hammer
and chisel to remove the substrate the anemone was on.
A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica were obtained
at low tide from points around Mussel Point and under-
neath Monterey Wharf #2 where sunlight did not penetrate.
More than one animal from a clone of A. elegantissima
was collected. Metridium senile was collected from floats
in Monterey harbor and Corynactis californica subtidally
at a depth of 55 feet. For the field studies, clonal
A. elegantissima was collected at heights of -O.6m,
Om, O.6m, 1.2m and 1.8m. In the same way, A.
elegantissima clones were collected from Agassiz and West
Beach.
Collection and culturing of ciliates
Ciliates were removed from anemones by dissection
