Feeding experiments
Populations of fifty ciliates were placed in each
of 10 vials, half containing the particulate dye India
ink and half containing carmine red. After a one day
incubation, the ciliates were removed, washed in
millipore-filtered sea water, and placed under a com¬
pound microscope to look for incorporation of the dye.

Examination of morphology and internal structure
Using phase microscopy, the ciliate appears as a
tear-drop shaped protozoan ranging in size from
approximately 50 u to 100 u. This size range is the
same as the Foettingeria sp. noted by Ball and Moebius
(1955).
The ciliate is concave in shape with its ventral
side invaginated. Morphologically, the most obvious
structure is a spiral band which wraps around the
protozoan and meets at the posterior and anterior ends
(Figure 2). This band is filamentous in form. On
these microfilaments are located tufts of cilia
uniformly arranged around the organism. At the pos-
terior end wherethe band of cilia meet is a cytostome
approximately 10 u in diameter. Aside from these
structures, any other feature is obscured by a yellow¬
tan cytoplasm which is uniformly shaped in the ciliate
(Figure 1). This, in turn, is surrounded by a clear
layer of ectoplasm ususally 10 u in thickness.
