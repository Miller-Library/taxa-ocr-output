the number of ciliates increased but leveled off at
an oral disc diameter of around 7 cm.
Stress tolerance studies
As seen in Figure 7, Foettingeria from the inter-
tidal rocks shows a sharply peaked temperature tolerance
rnage. The optimum range, a survival of 80% or higher.
occurred from 3 - 24°0. The survival dropped off quickly
on both sides of this range, however. Furthermore,
dark pigmented ciliates showed a wider temperature
optimum range than ciliates collected from aposymbiotic
anemones collected from under the Monterey Wharf.
Ciliates placed in starvation conditions showed
noticeable shanges after a one week period. After this
time there was still approximately 75% survival in the
population. Survivors, however showed bleaching of the
yellow-tan pigment they had begun with. After two weeks
of starvation, survival rate had decreased to 7%. Those
that did survive underwent encystment. Encystment was
characterized by a thickening of the clear plasma layer
surrounding the organism. Agitation of the cells in-
terrupts the encystment.
DISCUSSION
Movement and feeding studies
Movement by Foettingeria sp. appears to be one of
two types. Both of these types may have specific func¬
tions. The swimming mode may be used solely for loco¬
motion from one place to another. Crawling, on the
other hand, may be specific to foraging behavior. When
