Where different species of the same genus occupy the same
general area and habitat, and are more or less sympatric, the
extent to which they compete for various requirements is always
of interest. Acmaea pelta is often found in company with other
species of Acmaea, especially Acmaea limatula. In a study of
the foods of A. limatula, Eaton (1966) found that A. limatula
ingests primarily the red encrusting algae, Hildenbrandia,
Peyssonelia, Lithothamnion, Lithophyllum. In contrast A. pelta
eats very little of these species. The dictary studies suggest
that in situations where both species occur, there is relatively
little competition for food.
SUMMARY
1.
Most movement and feeding of Acmaea pelta occurs while
the animals are submerged and while they are being
splashed during tidal ebb. At night, the population
