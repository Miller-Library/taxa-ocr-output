is difficult to compare the availability of an alga with a
thallus many feet long with the availability of encrusting
forms. The abundance of microscopic algae was not determined.
These forms, consisting of diatoms and unicellular and
filimentous green and blue-green algae, occurred on otherwise
bare rock surfaces and as epiphytes on many of the larger
algae in all four areas. Very small juvenile individuals of
larger algae were included with the larger algae.
Twenty five Acmaea pelta whose guts retained foodmater-
ials in recognizable states were collected from each of the
four areas. A portion of the material from the stomach of
each animal was microscopically examined. Identifications of
algae in both field environment and stomachs were made with
the kind help of Dr. Isabella A. Abbott of the Hopkins Marine
Station. An attempt was made to assess the relative amount
of each alga present to within 10%. Materials which could
not be identified in microscopic examination are listed as
"unidentified debris". The values obtained from the analyses
of the stomach contents of the 25 A. pelta from each area
were then averaged (Figure 5).
