VERTICAL MOVEMENT
To test whether there was a general trend of vertical
movement on the rock surface in relation to tidal exposure,
the vertical component of movement of ten limpets was observed
at hourly intervals. The results reveal a specific pattern
(Fig. 3). When the tide rises at night a net upward dis-
placement occurs, followed by a net downward displacement as
the tide recedes. Similar movement patterns have been noted
in Acmaea limatula (Eaton, 1966) and Acmaea scutum (Rogers,
1966). Comparable data are not available for movements during
the day.
FEEDING ACTIVITY
Studies were made to determine the frequency and duration
of feeding periods, and the relation of feeding to tidal
exposure. Acmaea pelta placed in aquaria or on glass plates
covered with an algal film, and arranged so that radular
movements could be seen in ventral view, revealed a characÂ¬
teristic feeding behavior. The head sways from side to side,
completing a cycle in one to two minutes. This can be detected
in a dorsal view, even in the field, by watching the cephalic
