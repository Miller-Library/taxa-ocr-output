distance moved. The amount of movement and the area covered
varies considerably with individuals; one limpet moved no
more than two inches during any high tide period over a span
of four days, another covered a distance of six feet during a
single high tide period.
Figure 2 shows examples of the types of paths taken by
different individuals during a four day observation period,
Path A shows rather random movement with the limpet coming
to rest at a different spot at each exposure period. At some
time during the four day study, 11 of the 16 limpets exhibited
movement patterns like those of path B; they returned at least
ractty ha Sa
once to an-exact location previously occupied. Homing, i.e.
returning to the same exact spot and here adopting the same
orientation (Figure 2, path C), was noted in four of the
limpets. One individual homed after moving three feet away
from its spot. One limpet was observed to move into a spot
and assume the same orientation as another limpet which had
previously occupied that spot. Path D represents a type
often observed. The majority of movement repeatedly occurs
in a particular area, and the limpet returns to the same
small area (approximate diameter one inch) with each exposure
period but does not necessarily settle in the same exact spot
with the same orientation.
