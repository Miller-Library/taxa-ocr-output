Acmaea pelta Eschscholtz, 1833, is abundant in the rocky
intertidal zone along the California coast. Described as the
most eurytopic member of the genus Acmaea by Test (1945).
A. pelta ranges in its intertidal habitat from the higher
Endocladia to the lower Egregia associations at Mussel Point,
Pacific Grove, California. Studies of its biology to date
have been concerned with its general ecology (Test, 1945), the
effects of grazing on diatom populations (Castenholz, 1961).
the reproductive cycle (Fritchman, 1961, 1962), and its ecoÂ¬
logical role in the Endocladia zone (Glynn, 1965). The pres-
ent study was conducted to provide more information on the
behavior and foods of A. pelta.
