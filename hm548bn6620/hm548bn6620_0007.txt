tentacles. The mouth, if visible, is flattened and spread
over the substrate. Forward locomotion is relatively slow.
in one case about one om in five minutes. Feeding behavior
in the field and laboratory, as recorded by patterns scraped
by the radula on larger algae or on alga-covered glass plates,
corresponds with the above description. In such patterns,
produced by radular action as the limpet's head moves from
side to side, each individual rasp of the radula is visible
(Plate 1, B). At greater magnification the marks of indi-
vidual radular teeth can be seen (Plate 1, A). This pattern
of feeding provides a moderately efficient coverage of the
surface.
It was often difficult to tell whether animals were
feeding or not under field conditions, but some information
on the feeding activity of Acmaea pelta was obtained. Of the
limpets shown in Figure 1, three were not observed to feed
during the period of higher high water, and six showed neither
feeding nor other movement at lower high water. While feeding
may have occurred between observations, some limpets taken
from the field as the tide receded had no food in their stomachs
It appears that limpets do not necessarily feed during every
tidal cycle; for much of the period of activity the animals
