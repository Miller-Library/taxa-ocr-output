CRAIG, PETER C. (Hopkins Marine Sta., Pacific Grove, Calif., USA.)
The activity pattern and food habits of the limpet Acmaea pelta (Mollusca:
Gastropoda: Prosobranchia). The Veliger
Most movement and
feeding occurs when individuals are submerged at high tide or splashed
on receding tides. At night populations show a net displacement upward on vertical
rocks when the tide rises and a net displacement downward as the tide recedes.
Feeding is not continuous during periods of submersion and splash, and
individuals do not feed every high tide. A. pelta ingests a variety of
blue-green, green, red, and brown algae, both macroscopic and microscopic,
and diatoms. The most common macroscopic algac eaten are: Rhodoglossum affine
Endocladia muricata, Iridaea sp., Pelvetia fastigiata, and Egregia menziesii.
In habitats where Acmaea pelta occurs with A. limatula, the former eats mainly
larger, erect algae, the latter mainly encrusting and microscopic algae.
