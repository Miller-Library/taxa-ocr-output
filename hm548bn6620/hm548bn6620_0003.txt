FIELD STUDIES
In order to determine activity patterns of Acmaea pelta,
l6 limpets were individually marked and observed at hourly
intervals during high tides over a continuous period of four
days. Later, another 10 limpets were observed at 30 minute
or hourly intervals for a 24 hour period. A small mark was
painted on the substrate at each end of each limpet to indi-
cate the animal's original position; at each successive obser-
vation measurement of the distance and angle of the limpet in
relation to this point gave its new position. General move-
ment, feeding activity, and degree of tidal exposure were
noted at each observation. The degree of tidal exposure was
indicated using the descriptive terms of Glynn (1965):
exposed -- periods when the animals were exposed to air with-
out wetting by waves or splash; awash -- when the animals
were wetted by the sea, but not for more than 50% of the time
submerged -- when the animals were wetted more than 50% of
the time by splash or were continually immersed. The behay-
ioral criteria used to determine the occurrence of feeding in
the field were based on observations of Acmaea pelta under
laboratory conditions, and are described later
