The Egregia region, occupies the 2.0 - 0.0 foot level in
the intertidal zone (Smith, 1944). Here, too, macroscopic
plants form the major part (62%) of the diet of Acmaea pelta
(Figure 5, C). As in the Pelvetia region, one brown alga
predominates in the environment and in the gut contents.
Limpets are often found directly on the holdfast and stipes
of Egregia plants, and scars apparently caused by extensive
feeding are frequently found beneath them.
This tendency of A. pelta to ingest more macroscopic
than microscopic algae is reversed in the exposed and surf-
swept Postelsia region (4.0 to 1.0 foot intertidal level;
Smith, 1944). Over half the limpets collected in this region
were taken from Postelsia stipes, but Postelsia is not the major
food found in their stomachs. They apparently feed mainly on
diatoms and other epiphytic microscopic algae growing on
Postelsia (Figure 5, D). Limpets not directly on Postelsia
also ingested quantities of Iridaea. Microscopic algae con-
stitutes 45% of the volume of stomach contents and macroscopic
algae only 32% in this zone.
Comparisons of plant foods available and stomach contents
from the four regions shows that A. pelta does not feed at
random but ingests significantly large quantities of macroscopic
