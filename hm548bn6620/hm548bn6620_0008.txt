move about without showing clear evidence of feeding. The
statement by Test (1945, p. 397) that Acmaea pelta "feeds at
any and all times, regardless of whether the tide is in or
out", is not supported by the present study.
FOODS OF ACMAEA PELTA
Since A. pelta is a very eurytopic organism, the question
arises whether it is able to feed on a wide variety of plant
material or feeds on a few forms which are widely distributed
in the intertidal region. Published accounts (Test, 1945;
Fritchman, 1961) indicate that A. pelta eats a variety of
algae, both microscopic and macroscopic, but quantitative
information is lacking. A study was therefore made to deter-
mine the foods available to A. pelta and the foods actually
eaten, and to assess evidences of food selection.
Acmaea pelta are most abundant in mid to upper intertidal
regions that can often be characterized by the presence of
Endocladia, Pelvetia, Egregia, or Postelsia (Figure 4). Four
areas were chosen, each a region where a different one of the
above algae predominated. Since any alga present might repre-
sent a possible food source for A. pelta, an attempt was made
to estimate the relative quantities of the different macro-
scopic algae present (Figure 5). Estimates are crude, for it
