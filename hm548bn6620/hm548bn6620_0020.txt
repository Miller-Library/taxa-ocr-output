Figure 1
Movement and feeding activity of ten Acmaea pelta observed
at thirty minute or hourly intervals over a period of 24 hours,
May 4-5, 1966. Limpets are indicated in order of their vertical
positions on the rock surface; individuals lower on the rock were
awash and submerged for longer periods. The extended time during
which the two highest limpets were awash on the receding higher
high water was due to downward movement of these aimals on the rock.
Figure 2
Representative tracks of four individual Acmaea pelta on a
vertical rock surface over a period of three days, May 26-28.
1966. For cach track, each type of line represents movement during
one complete tidal cycle, and the limpets were exposed only at
lower low water. Points enclosed by small squares are the places
where the limpets remained stationary during periods of low water.
Consistent homing behavior is indicated by the track in Figure 2. C.
Figure 3
Net vertical displacement of the ten limpets in Figure 1 at
successive intervals during one nighttime higher high water, May
4-5, 1966. Bach bar represents approximately the movement during
one hour. Differences due to different vertical positions of the
limpets have been compensated for by independently calcufating
the movement each animal underwent during the phases of tide
indicated.
