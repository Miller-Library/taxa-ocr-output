elicited. Based on this experiment, Craig et al. suggest that the specific vertebrate target of C.
striatus venom may be a Kvl type channel.
In this study, 1 attempted build upon the work of Craig et al. and identify the specific,
high affinity target of C. striatus toxin in frog using a conventional two electrode voltage clamp
technique in conjunction with Xenopus oocytes expressing Kvl a channel subunits.
Methods:
Oocyte Extraction and Culture- As previously described, adult Xenopus frogs were
anesthetized with 200 mg tricane dissolved in Ca+ free water and 1 or 2 ovarian lobes were
surgically removed under conditions that induce hypothermia in frogs (Keller 1991).
Immediately after surgery, frogs were retuned to Ca+ free water and observed for
approximately an hour or until anesthesia had completely worn off. Lobes of oocytes were
treated with 10mg collagenase A in 10ml Ca++ free OR2 (Keller 1991) for 1 hour at room
temperature to remove the thin layer of sheath tissue. Ã„fter collagenase treatment, oocytes were
manually disassociated with two pairs of forceps and subjected to additional collagenase
treatments at the same concentration as necessary to completely remove sheath tissue. Stage 5
and 6 oocytes with uniformly pigmented animal and vegetable poles were segregated from the
ovarian tissue and rinsed 5 times with OR2 and 5 additional times with ND96 (Kllet 1991).
Oocytes were cultured with 1OmM antibiotic and 10mM sodium pyruvate. Cells were carried for
up to one week.
lon Channel Expression- Six different ion channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes: frog
Kvl.1, 1.2, 1.3, rat Kv4.1, ShakerA6-46 and ShakerA6-46 T449V. Concentrations of injected
