Frog Kvl.1 and Kvl.3 channels are insensitive to a 1:1000 dilution of milked venom. As
described in methods, families of ly traces at different voltages were recorded in the absence and
presence of a 1:1000 dilution of C. striatus milked venom in ND96. Figure 2a and 2c are plots
of the peak lk versus voltage for Kvl.1 and 1.3, respectively. These graphs demonstrate that for
à representative cell, there is no significant effect of milked venom on either Kvl.1 or 1.3. In
order to average the results of multiple experiments (n-3 Kvl.1, n-2 Kvl.3), potassium
conductance (gr) was plotted versus membrane voltage. Conductance was calculated from the
relation 1= gk (V-Vk), where V is equal to the membrane voltage and Vg is the reversal
potential for Ig. Given the technical difficulties of determining reversal potential of Ig in a
Xenopus oocyte, Vg was approximated with the Nernst equation.

Thus, a value of -100mV was used to calculate conductance, and data from each cell was
normalized to the maximum conductance of that cell. Figure 2b and 2d show the gg-V relations
for Kvl.1 and 1.3. As expected, there is no significant difference in conductance profiles in the
presence and absence of milked venom.
Shaker clones are insensitive to milked venom. Given the insensitivity of frog Kvl channels
to milked venom, further experiments were performed to test the effects of C. striatus milked
venom on Shaker channels. Both clones tested, Shaker A6-46 and A6-46 T449V were
completely insensitive to milked venom (n—4 and n-3, respectively). Concentrations as high as
