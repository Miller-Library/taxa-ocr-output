Abstract:
Conus striatus is a predatory cone snail that subdues its prey with a wide array of
neuroactive peptides. The milked venom of C. striatus has been shown to induce paralytic
seizures when injected into fish and repetitive action potentials in frog sympathetic ganglion
cells and neuromuscular junction (Joseph Schulz, personal communication). Recently, Craig et
al. (1998) reported that the primary peptide constituent of the milked venom of C. striatus is a
4kD o-glycosylated peptide, named KA-conotoxin SIVA, and proposed that this peptide acts as a
low affinity antagonist of Shaker potassium channels. In order to identify a specific, high
affinity target of KA-conotoxin, experiments were carried out with Xenopus oocytes injected
with mRNA encoding various voltage gated potassium channels. The pharmacological effects of
milked venom on these channels were assayed using a conventional, two electrode voltage clamp
method. None of the potassium channels tested (Xenopus Kvl.1, 1.2, 1.3 and Shaker B A6-46,
A6-46 T449V) were significantly affected by milked venom at concentrations well above the
minimum amount required to induce repetitive firing of frog neuromuscular junction. These data
indicate that the high affinity target of KA-conotoxin is not one of the Shaker homologues tested.
Introduction:
The genus Conus includes more than 500 species of predatory snails. These snails have
evolved a distinctive hunting strategy in which venom filled harpoons are injected into the tissue
of nearby prey. This venom has attracted considerable interest, given the incredible diversity of
toxins within the genus. For example, different species of cone snails produce venom specific
for animals in five different phyla (Mclntosh et al. 2000). Since each snail produces between 50
and 100 unique peptides as constituents of their venom, the number of potentially different
