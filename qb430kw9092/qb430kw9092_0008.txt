1:100 elicited no appreciable attenuation of peak current levels, even when the oocyte was
exposed to toxin for over 20 minutes (figure 3).
Shaker channels are sensitive to Yellow Stuff. Given the insensitivity of Kvl channels to C.
striatus milked venom, it became necessary to test the experimental manipulations to insure that
there was no significant toxin effect. To this end, Yellow Stuff, an alternative toxin with known
effects on Shaker channels was added to Xenopus oocytes expressing Shaker channels. In
contrast to C. striatus milked venom, the addition of a 1:100 dilution of Yellow Stuff was shown
to have a significant pharmacological effect on the peak currents of Shaker potassium channels
(Kelly et al. in press). Figure 4 is a representative experiment in which peak current levels were
shown to diminish by as much as 40 percent. This result is in partial agreement with the study
by Kelly et al., in which Yellow Stuff was shown to diminish peak current levels and slow
activation kinetics in cells expressing Shaker.
Discussion:
The results of the Yellow Stuff experiment indicate that the methods used in this study
are sufficiently sensitive to observe a significant pharmacological effect. This procedural control
demonstrates that the perfusion system, recording electrodes, and the ion channel expression
system were adequate to observe significant changes in the behavior of Shaker potassium
channel. Thus, Kvl.1, Kvl.3 and Shaker potassium channels Xenopus oocytes have been shown
to be insensitive to C. striatus milked venom. These channels demonstrated no appreciable
changes in potassium currents even at concentrations of milked venom 10 to 100 times greater
than that required to induce repetitive firing of action potentials in frog neuromuscular junction.
