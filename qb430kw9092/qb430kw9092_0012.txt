Figure 1: IV trace. A. Plot of current versus time in a typical voltage clamp experiment in
Xenopus oocytes expressing frog KV1.1 channels. B. Schematic diagram of the voltage and
duration of pulses applied to each cell.
Figure 2: Toxin Response Curves in Frog KVI.1 and KVI.3. A. IV curve of a representative
voltage clamp experiment in which a 1:1000 dilution of striatus milked venom was added to an
oocyte expressing KVI.1. B. GV curve illustrating the averaged response of 3 independent
experiments. C. IV curve of a representative voltage clamp experiment in which a 1:1000
dilution of striatus milked venom was added to an oocyte expressing KVI.3. B. GV curve
illustrating the averaged response of 2 independent experiments.
Figure 3: Toxin Response in Shaker potassium channels. A. IV curve of a representative voltage
clamp experiment in which a 1:1000 dilution of striatus milked venom was added to an oocyte
expressing Shaker d6-46 T449V. B. IV curve of a representative voltage clamp experiment in
which a 1:100 dilution of striatus milked venom was added to an oocyte expressing Shaker d6-
46 over a 20 minute time course.
Figure 4: IV curve of a Xenopus oocyte expressing Shaker d6-46 potassium channels in the
presence and absence of Yellow Stuff.
