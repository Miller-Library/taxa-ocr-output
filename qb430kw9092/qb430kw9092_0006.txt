RNA were optimized for each channel type. In general, potassium currents of 2-16 uA were
achieved by diluting between 0.5 and 18 ng RNA in 50nl RNAse free water and injecting the
entire solution into the animal hemisphere of a stage 5 or 6 oocyte (Rosenthal 1996). Adequate
expression was normally observed within 24 hours of injection.
Voltage Clamp- 2 Glass microelectrodes between 0.7 and 2.0 MQ were filled with 3M KCl and
used with a conventional voltage clamp (Model, Axon Instruments). The holding potential was
et at -60mV. Ooctyes were subjected to voltage pulses lasting 25 ms and stepped at 10 mV
increments between -50 and 40 mV. Ã„fter subtracting leakage and capacitive currents on line
with a standard p/-4 technique, the remaining trace was taken to be the potassium current, Ig, due
to heterologous ion channel expression. Typically, 300 ul of a 1:1000 dilution of C. striatus
milked venom with known biological activity was added to the chamber (approximately 100 ul
total volume) using a conventional perfusion setup. Ig was recorded upon establishment of a
successful voltage clamp, after a control solution change of ND96, after the addition of toxin,
and after 3-4 ml of ND96 was used to washout toxin (Craig 1998).
Results:
Kvl family channels demonstrate quick activation. Figure 1 illustrates a representative Ig
trace recorded from a Xenopus oocyte expressing Xenopus Kv1.1 channels. Like all other Kvl
channels tested, Kv1.1 demonstrates quick activation and reaches peak current levels in about
5ms, at +40mV. Furthermore, every Kvl clone tested demonstrated little or no inactivation over
the course of a 25 ms pulse.
