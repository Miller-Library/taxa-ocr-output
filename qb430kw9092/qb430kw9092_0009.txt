Moreover, given the absence of even a moderate alteration of conductance in the
pr√©sence of toxin, we can conclude that the Kvl family most likely does not contain the specific,
high affinity target of C. striatus venom. Although this statement cannot be proven to be
absolutely correct until every Kvl channel has been tested for activity, the weight of evidence at
this point suggests that the high affinity target is another type of voltage gated potassium
channel, or perhaps a different type of channel altogether.
These results disagree with the results of Craig et al. However, based upon the nearly
absolute insensitivity of Shaker channels to the presence of milked venom at the concentrations
tested, it seems possible that the decline of potassium currents in the presence of C. striatus
peptide reported by Craig et al. is due to a non-specific, low affinity interaction seen at high
peptide concentrations that has little to do with the physiological effects of this conotoxin on frog
or fish neurons.
Every Shaker clone tested in this study contained a deletion of amino acids 6 to 46. This
deletion resulted in potassium currents that were insusceptible to fast, N-type inactivation. One
of the clones, ShakerA6-46 T449V also did not display strong C-type inactivation. Since the
reported effects of C. striatus venom dealt exclusively with the peak conductance, it is unlikely
that the absence of inactivation has confounded these experiments. However, I cannot say with
absolute certainty that C. striatus venom has no effect on true, wild-type Shaker channels with
inactivation, i.e. the channel studied by Craig et al.. Since amino acids 6-46 are on the interior of
the channel protein and thus unlikely to contact an extracellular toxin, the weight of available
evidence suggests that the high affinity target of C. striatus milked venom is not a Kvl channel.
