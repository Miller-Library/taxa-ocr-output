Acknowledgements:
1 would like to give a special thanks to my advisor for this project, William Gilly, who
has been a constant source of advice, support and encouragement. Without his efforts, this paper
would have never been written. Second, I would like to thank all the instructors and students in
Experimental Neurobiology, whose hard work and commitment has been inspiring throughout
the quarter. Finally, I would like to thank Joseph Schulz, who has helped me more than I can
ever describe.
