Materials and Methods
Part 1
A series of phytoplankton samples were collected at 8
stations (Figure 1) around Point Pinos once a week for 4 weeks.
On each sampling day, collections were made at 6:00 am, 12:00
noon, and 6:00 pm. Sampling was completed within ig hours.
Samples were collected from shore with a + meter fine mesh
phytoplankton net. 4 buckets of water (32 liters) were
poured throughthe net and milked into small bottles.
Offshore samples were collected on "The Tage" on 4 days.
When possible samples were collected from 5 stations. (Figure 2)
3 off Point Pinos, one off Lovers Point and one off Hopkins
Marine Station near the bell buoy. Due to unfavorable weather
conditions on one of the days, it was impossible to reach more
than 2 stations. Offshore samples were obtained by dropping
a weighted + meter phytoplankton net over the side of "The Tage
on a 25 foot line. It was dropped and pulled in 3 times at
each station. The net was not towed while the boat was moving
but dropped vertically while the boat was stopped. However,
due to the movement of the water, the tow was not always
completely vertical.
Samples were counted within 3 days of collection using an
Untermohl tube (Doty modification) and an inverted microscope.
The concentrated samples had to be diluted sufficiently in
order to count them. From the bottle (32 ml) into which the
sample was collected, a subsample of 5 ml was removed and
diluted with millipore-filtered sea water. The degree of
dilution depended on the concentration of sample. Most
samples, because of their density, had to be diluted 1:16.
