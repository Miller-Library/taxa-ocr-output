Introduction
Because of the photosynthetic capacity of phytoplankton,
all animals in the marine environment are ultimately dependent
on them for sustenance. It is therefore of primary importance
to determine the effectsof water quality on their survival
and abundance.
The location of Point Pinos, where the following study
was carried out, proved favorable for such an analysis because
phytoplankton in Monterey Bay have been studied extensively.
(Bolin & Abbott, 1963) Annual cycles of increases and decreases
in phytoplankton numbers are fairly well understood. The
different resident species have been followed through their
anal cycles and their blooming behavior has been recorded.
Effects of upwelling and resultant high quantities of nutrients
on phytoplankton abundance have been observed. Periods of
high and low diversity in plankton populations during the
different marine seasons has been determined. Thus, a large
body of data have been collected regarding phytoplankton in
Monterey bay which could be compared with possibly ahnormal
data collected at Point Pinos.
It is known (Raymont, 1963, and Goldman, 1969) that in
areas subject to high concentrations of inorganic and
organic waste material, phytoplankton growth is promoted and
abnormal blooms result. Often particular species survive better
than others under such conditions and the natural assortment
of phytoplankton species is disrupted. Although natural
conditions may be altered, there may or may not be harmfulseffects.
If the bloom becomes very thick, increasing water turbidity, it
can reduce light reaching bottom algae, thereby affecting their
