and Pacific Grove sewage it disappeared in two days in every
culture and in 10% sewage it increased very little. These
results imply that in the field sewage would have varied
effects on different species of phytoplankton.
From the cultures in sea water and nutrient culture
medium, the two organisms appear to behave differently in the
presence of different nutrient supplies. It appears that
Nitzschis closterium could survive better than Navicula under
conditions of fewer nutrients as seen in the large percentage
of Nitzschia closterium in the pure sea water cultures and
the large increase of Nitzschia when Navicula suddenly decreased
in the Ist series of cultures. These results suggest that
genera could benefit differentially in different concentrations
of nutrients in the field. Certain species (Navicula for example)
could bloom when nutrients are plentiful and others (Nitzschia
closterium) when they are scarce. It has been said (Patrick.
1948) that the supply of nutrients is so closely correlated
with the abundance of diatoms that one could forecast succession
of diatom blooms from the type of nutrient supply.
