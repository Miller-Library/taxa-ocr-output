It is apparent here that if one wished to accurately follow
day by day changes in the phytoplankton populations it would
he necessary to take uniform samples at the same time each day.
Part II
Series I
In the first set of phytoplankton cultures, grown in
Monterey sewage effluent, there were 3 species of diatoms
at the start of the experiment: Navicula, Nitzchia closterium
and Fragilaria. These species were the only ones that
survived in the experimental culture conditions in the green
house out of approximately 30 genera in the original samples
from which they came.
In the cultures containing each of the 3 dilutions of
Monterey sewage the percent of Navicula in the culture (Figure 7)
increased repidly for the first few days and remained at a
relatively high level throughout the experiment. In pure
sea water (Figure 7, lowest line) Navicula decreased on the
average, whereas in nutrient culture media it increased for
10 days and then drastically decreased.
The percent of Nitzschia closterium (Figure 8) in the
cultures dropped immediately in 50% and 100% sewage but
increased slightly in 10 sewage. The results from cultures
containing sea water and culture media were opposite from
those of Navicula. In sea water Nitzschia increased
immediately and in culture media it rose slightly at first
and then bloomed on the 1Oth day. In general, Navicula
