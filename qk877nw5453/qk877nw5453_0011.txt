The kinds of genera found during the study were all
genera common to Monterey Bay at that time of year. There is
no reason to suspect that the Pacific Grove outfall causes
abnormal blooms of one species or another. The bloom observed
at the end of April consisting mainly of the diatoms Eucampia,
Asterionella and Chaetoceros, and the bloom of Chaetoceros
in May would not be unexpected. Chaetoceros has been recorded
(Bolin and Abbott, 1963) to bloom almost continually during
most of the year in Monterey Bay. During the upwelling season
(February-September) when nutrients are brought from deeper
depths to the surface, Eucampia and Asterionella are known to
bloom. Dinoflagellates on the other hand were always fewer
in number than the diatoms but occurred in larger relative
numbers as diatoms were decreasing.
The results from the laboratory cultures grown in this
study suggest that sewage may be both unfavorable and favorable
to phytoplankton. Growth of Navicula was promoted in Monterey
sewage. It was apparently able to take advantage of excess
nutrients in Monterey sewage. In Pacific Grove sewage on the
other hand, the percentage of Navicula in the culture decreased.
The difference between Navicula's behavior in Monterey and
Pacific Grove sewage may have been due to the excessive amount
ofchlorine added to Pacific Grove sewage after treatment, or
perhaps other toxic components of Pacific Grove sewage.
Nitzschia closterium is commonly regarded as a particularly
hardy species and able to withstand extreme conditions. In
this study however, unlike Navicula, it did not increase when
cultured in sewage. In 100% and 50% dilutions of both Monterey
