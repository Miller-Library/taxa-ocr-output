photosynthetic capability. The dissolved oxygen concentration
in the area of the outfall may be adversely affected during
phytoplankton blooms. At night when the phytoplankton use
rather than produce oxygen, they may deplete the supply available
to other organisms which could normally live in the same
vicinity. In addition, if the phytoplankton produce oxygen
near the sunlit surface, and consume oxygen on the bottom
(phytoplankton move downwards in the night) the oxygen balance
will be upset. When the dissolved oxygen concentration is
reduced organic wastes cannot be oxidized and will accumulate
on the sea bottom in harmful amounts (Marine Advisors, 1956,
and Prager, 1969).
