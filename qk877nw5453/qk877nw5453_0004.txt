Materials and Methods
Part I cont'd.
Phytoplankton in a portion (2.5 ml or the volume of the Untermohl
ml
tube which varied between 2.3-2.8) of the diluted sample were
counted. Organisms were allowed to settle in the Untermohl
tubes for  hour. A differential count was made of the
different genera present. Each cell in multi-celled organisms
such as Eucampia or Chaetoceros were counted as one individual.
Each sample took roughly 45 minutes to count. Approximately
30 different genera were counted, and the number of cells of
each genera present in one liter of sea water sampled was
calculated. Data from a representative day for all 3 sampling
times, appear in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Totals for all collection
days appear in Tables 4 and 5.
Part II
Samples of phytoplankton collected at Poing Pinos were
added to nutrient culture media (containing nitrates,
phosphates, silicates, trace metals, vitamins, and tris buffer)
in Erlenmeyer flasks and allowed to grow in the greenhouse at
"natural" sea water temperature (10-15Â° 0) and with natural
lighting. Each culture flask was swirled 30 times once a
day. A thick healthy culture grew in approximately two weeks.
This phytoplankton stock was divided into 250 ml
Erlenmeyer flasks to which sewage was added in various concentration
Two series of tests were run, one with Monterey sewage and
another with chlorinated Pacific Grove sewage.
The following amounts of sewage and control medium were
added to 100 ml aliquots of phytoplankton stock culture:
