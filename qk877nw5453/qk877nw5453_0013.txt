Summary
The distribution of phytoplankton at Point Pinos was
studied by periodic sampling at 13 stations on and offshore.
Due to constant variability in phytoplankton distribution and
numbers hoth hour by hour and day by day, it was necessary to
take a large number of samples. Inshore samples were collected
once a week for four weeks. Three collections were made on
each sampling day at 6:00 am, 12 noon, and 6:00 pm. 32 liters
of water were sampled at each inshore station at each sampling
time. Offshore samples were vertical tows which sampled
approximately 1100 liters at each station, the net being dropped
3 times at each station. Offshore collections were also taken
once a week for 4 weeks but at one time of day only. Samples
were examined in 1-3 days after collection. A differential
count was made of each species present in each sample.
Counts showed that numbers of phytoplankton on the outfall
side of Point Pinos were always larger on the average than
numbers on the opposite side. In addition, offshore samples
had far fewer individuals than shore samples. These results
suggest that the phytoplankton nearest the outfall may benefit
from an excess of inorganic nutrients in the sewage, but this
cannot be con√®luded from the data.
Mixed cultures of two species of diatoms, Nitzschia
closterium and Navicula were grown in different dilutions of
sewage from Monterey and Pacific Grove. The two species
behaved differently. Growth of Nitzschia
closterium was
inhibted by both kinds of sewage. Navicula grew well in
Monterey sewage but very poprly in Pacific Grove sewage.
