Discussion
Sewage effluent could possibly affect phytoplankton in
a number of ways depending on the kinds and concentrations of
the constituents of sewage. Sewage from a particular area
could contain poisonous or toxic substances (Marine Advisors,
La Jolla, 1956) which may be harmful to some species whereas
a different quality of sewage might enhance phytoplankton
growth.
It is not possible to conclude from the results obtained
in this study that the phytoplankton at Point Pinos are
abnormally affected by the effluent produced from the sewage
outfall. The higher number of plankton found at the 5 stations
on the outfall side of Point Pinos as opposed to the opposite
side suggests that a higher concentration of nutrients such as
nitrates and phosphates from the outfall may be causing the
increase. Station 1, a hook-shaped embayment directly south
of the outfall, and popularly called "Coliform Cove" may
physically trap phytoplankton and nutrients since this cove
faces the prevailing southwest winds. The further decrease in
numbers of phytoplankton collected offshore suggest an even
smaller concentration of nutrients present offshore. It is
often common however for there to be a higher number of
phytoplankton close to shore due to nutrients from shore runoff.
Whether the large abundance of phytoplankton at Point Pinos is
a result of fertilization by natural runoff or from the sewage
cannot be determined from the results of this study due to
lack of shore stations in a comparable area far from the
outfall.
