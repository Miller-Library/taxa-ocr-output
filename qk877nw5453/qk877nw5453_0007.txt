Part I
The data collected in the field do not show recurrent and
striking characteristics of the different stations which might
be a result of the presence of the outfall. However, the stations
(Figure 3) on the outfall (south and southeast) side of Point
Pinos (stations 1-5) averaged higher numbers of phytoplankton
than the stations on the opposite side of the point. In addition.
the stations (figure 3) offshore had far fewer individuals than
those close to shore at Point Pinos.
During the sampling period at Point Pinos a peak bloom
(83,000 cells/liter water, see Figure 4) of diatoms appeared
during the second week which decreased to a very small number
(7,000 cells/liter water) of individuals by the fourth week.
The predominant genus in this bloom was Eucampia, (25,000 cells/
liter water), while two other diatoms, Asterionella, (21,000 cells/
liter water) and Chaetoceros (16,000 cells/liter water) were
also numerous. (Figure 4) Offshore sampling was begun as the
first bloom tapered off. By the fifth week, offshore data
(Figure 5) show another minor bloom where the predominant
genus was Chaetoceros.
The samples included both diatoms and dinoflagellates,
but the blooms were of diatoms. In between the blooms, the
percentage of dinoflagellates in the samples increased.
The most recurrent and distinct characteristic of the
phytoplankton collections was the great abundance of plankton in
the morning samples (Figure 6) relative to the noon and evening
ones. It is typical of phytoplankton to exist near the surface
in the morning and then move downwards during the day.
