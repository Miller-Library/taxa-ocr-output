All sewage dilutions were brought up to the same salinity
as sea water with "Instant Ocean" sea salts.
Duplicate cultures were made of each of the above
dilutions. Cultures were grown in the greenhouse at sea water
temperature and each flask was swirled 20 times each day.
Cells in each culture were examined every two days for
approximately 2 weeks. A differential count was made of the
different genera present. A total of approximately 500 cells
was counted from each culture at each examination time and
percentageswof live and dead cells of each species present
were calculated.
