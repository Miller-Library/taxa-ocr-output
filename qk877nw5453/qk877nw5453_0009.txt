appears to survive in Monterey sewage while Nitzschia does
not.
On the 2nd day of the culture period Fragil aria decreased
in number to almost no individuals in every flask, including
4 controls, and never increased significantly again.
Series II
The second set (Figure 9) of cultures, grown in Pacific
Grove chlorinated sewage, showed similar results for Nitzschia
closterium but Navicula did not survive as well in Pacific
Grove sewage as it did in Monterey sewage.
Navicula decreased in all concentrations of sewage, but
most rapidly in 100%. Its behavior in sea water and nutrient
media cultures was essentially thegsame as in Series I.
In 100% and 50% sewage, Nitzschia as expressed by its
proportion to all phytoplankton decreased immediately and
in 10% it decreased slowly. In sea water it increased at
first and then fell slowly and in culture media it remained
relatively constant.
Fragilaria was scarce in all the Series II cultures
at the beginning of the experiment and remained that way
throughout.
Note: The results for the duplicate cultures run for each
dilution were very similar and values are averaged in figures
7-9. In Series II, results of the dilutions of 50% P.G.
sewage in 1) Sea water and 2) Culture Medium, were also very
close, and values for these are averaged in Figures 9 and 10.
The same was done with the 10% sewage cultures in Series II.
