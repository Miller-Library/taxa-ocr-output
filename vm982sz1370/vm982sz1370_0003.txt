Dear Dr. Abbott,
Both Willie and I apologize for not having sent you some
preliminary data sooner. However, after we last saw you,
time has been so scarce (Thanksgiving, finals, etd.) that
this is the first change we've had to sit down tomarize
our work this quarter.
Although our results are preliminary if that, hopefully
the following will give you a better idea of what we've
spent the past quarter working on.
Also... have an enjoyable and profitable trip next
quarter, and a Merry Christmas to you and your family.
Sincerely,
Wille
