Preliminary notes on the growth rates of Tegula funebralis and
of Acmaea asmi
I. Installation of cages:
The majority of the time this quarter was spent on this
phase of our project. The installation of the cages proved
to be a more difficult task than was originally intended
and consequently took more time. Our initial populations of
both species were able to escape within two weeks, but the holes
in the cageshave since been closed. We now feel that
we have an adequate means of confining the animals, one which
will withstand the environment and one which does not
adversely affedtthe population; i.e. five T. funebralis
died over a period of three months. However each was found
stuck between the cage fittings and the ground, and we
felt that their death was caused by being caught in an
attempt to escape and not, therefore, having access to
food, etc.
II. Marking
Our original marking system proved to be unsatisfactory
due to erosion of the shell apex; subsequently we marked
T. funebralis on the sides of the shell. A. asmi's markings
proved adequate. Our process is as follows: 1) applying
a base coat of red nail polish; 2) writing a number on this
base with Indian ink; 3) Covering with one or two coats
of clear polish; 4) renewing the numbers and top coat
at least once a month.
In addition, we plan to try etching numbers into the
shells next quarter and cutting the lip of the T. funebralis
III. Measurement:
Due to additional time spent on the above preliminary steps
adequate measurement of growth was not completed. The method
used was to measure the largest basal diameter of the shells;
however, the results were poor as for over two hundred
T. funebralis marked, of which we have subsequent
