O
measurements of twenty-five, only five increased their size
measureably, each by .5 mm and, having measured these animals
many times, it has been concluded that .5 mm is our error range.
Not a single a. asmi grew a measureable amount although we
measured both widest basal diameter and length from base to
apex along the widest curve.
The loss of population made it extremely hard to view a
large sample size over the entire quarter. As stated above,
we plan to scratch T. funebralis' lips amd to measure the
distance traveled by the mark. In this manner a more predise
measurement will be obtained. As for A. asmi, we're still
thinking of a manner to obtain precise measurements and
have not been successful.
