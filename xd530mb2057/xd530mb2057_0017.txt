atrovirens which is manifested in differing numbers of tympanic
spines (Love and Larson, 1978). Whatever the case may be, this sub¬
ject warrants further investigation.
As far as the other species which has not been discussed vet.
there is not enough information to make a conclusion concerning the
olive rockfish (S. serranoides) and its mtDNA. With allozyme
studies, it appears to be a sister species with S. mystinus, the blue
rockfish (Seeb, 1986) . In the only digests for which I have included
olive rockfish data, it seems to segregate with the blue rockfish.
However, inconclusive data from other digests seemed to show
differences between the two species. If this is true, then it would
demonstrate how much more effective mtDNA studies are in showing
differences between species as compared to isozyme studies.
More samples need to be analyzed, and more enzymes need to be
tested to get a more accurate assessment of mtDNA variation in the
genus Sebastes. To further resolve the question of the kelp rock¬
fish species, allozyme studies should be conducted. In addition.
direct sequencing may give the higher degree of resolution that is
needed to make the best conclusions concerning the interesting
results we found here.
