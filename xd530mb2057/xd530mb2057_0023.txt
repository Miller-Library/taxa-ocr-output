figure 1. Two autoradiographs. Above is the double digest of three kelp individuals with
BamHl and Clal. The upper of the three bands for the individual is the BamHl digest, the middle
lane is the double digest, and the lower lane is the Clal digest The middle individual (of the
Kelp A varirty) seems to have a restriction site in Clal, but the 17 kb fragment is DNA that
has been physically nicked open. This is true because the double digest shows the BamHl
fragments not getting cut again. In the lower gel, several individuals are digested by Hindll.
From the top, a copper, a black and yellow, a black, and seven blues. The black and blue
rockfishes have the same RFLP, and the other two share an RFLP. The middle band of the blues
and black has been cut once more in the other two lanes.

O.C. stands for open circle configuration. Below the bands are the proposed maps. They are
not necessarily accurate, just a visual aid to understanding the fragment patterns.

program.
