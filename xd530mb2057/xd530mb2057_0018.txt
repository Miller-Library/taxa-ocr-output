Acknowledgments
I will never forget my experience at the Hopkins Marine Station,
and I have several people to thank for it. Without Linda Park, my
project would not have existed, and I appreciate the great deal of
time, work, patience, and care she gave to me this quarter. I would
also like to thank my advisor, Dennis Powers for his help and
instruction and for letting me work in his lab. Rob Rowan, Lynna
Hereford, Lani West, Doug Crawford, and all the others in the lab
really helped me get through my project. Dave VanTresca and the
other collectors did excellent work. Sam Wang and Jenifer Levitt
put great effort into making the class a success. I thank all the
other faculty and staff at the Marine Station for keeping things
going and making the class feel so welcome. Without the
encouragement of my peers who took the class in previous years, my
advisor Bob Simoni, and other professors back at Stanford 1 may not
have come, so 1 thank them. Finally, I would like to thank my father
and my parents for their support and encouragement during the
quarter.
