tion for open circle, a distinctive band which travels about half the
distance from the well to the band where linear fragments greater
than 20 kb cluster.
think the figures are fairly clear upon exam¬
ination, and I will discuss them in greater detail in the discussion
section.
From the variability of the sites, genetic distances were calcu¬
lated and a cladogram was also constructed. Only the data from the
kelp, blue, and black rockfish were used because no other species
had complete data for all the enzymes. As it is, these results are
merely speculative. Not nearly enough individuals were examined to
give significant results; however, it is still interesting to see what
phylogenetic information these data give.
Genetic distance, d, can be calculated according to Nei's genetic
distance
d= Ein(S))/r
where r is the number of nucleotide bases per restriction site and
(S) is the probability that a pair of sequences X and Y share a given
restriction site according to
(S) = 2nxy/(nx + ny).
In the last equation, the ny and ny terms refer to the number of DNA
fragments in all the digests for species X and Y while nyy is the
number of shared fragments (Hartl and Clark, 1990). Table 2 gives
calculated values for all the groups of individuals that had the same
polymorphisms for every enzyme, or in other words, all the groups of
individuals that segregated together.
The cladogram was constructed with McClade on a Maclntosh SE
(see figure 9). Cladistics attempts to build phylogenetic trees based
on informative restriction sites. For all the sites which show dif¬
ferences between groups, presence or absence of the site is recor¬
ded. It two or more groups share the presence or absence of a site,
then that site is phylogenetically informative. Based on the number
of steps (site changes) it would take for the groups to arrange
themselves in a particular order, a best tree is selected which
requires the least number of steps. This tree is presented in fig. 9.
