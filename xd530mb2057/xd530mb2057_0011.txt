were rinsed with distilled water, and they were ready for exposure
to film.
Developina
The membranes were patted dry with paper towels and wrapped
in one layer of plastic wrap. The wrapped membranes were taped to
a developing screen. Then, X-ray film was placed between the mem¬
branes and another developing screen. This was closed tightly into a
developing cartridge and placed in a -70°C freezer. The film was
exposed to the radioactive bands in the membranes for three days at
which time the film was run through the developing machine, produ¬
cing the final product, an autoradiograph.
Results
The first result to report is the success of the probe we used. It
appears that a mtDNA probe from Fundulus is sufficient for hybri¬
dizing with rockfish mtDNA. At least earlier in the study, the auto¬
radiographs were clear, and the probe seemed to be working fine.
Later, unexpected problems arose with the autoradiographs. It was
difficult to get the probe radioactively labelled, and this may have
been the problem. However, the problem could have been in any of a
number of steps from denaturing the gels to UV-fixing the mem¬
branes to hybridizing and washing the membranes. Nevertheless,
was able to get enough data from the autoradiographs that did deve¬
lop and from the polaroid pictures of the ethidium-stained gels, that
could quantify the data in some ways.
was able to see fragment patterns of blacks, blues, and kelps
for all the enzymes considered. A maximum of around ten to fifteen
individuals in each species were informative for any given enzyme,
although sometimes fewer than five individuals in one species could
be clearly analyzed for an enzyme. The four individuals from other
species did not always show up clearly for every enzyme they were
digested with.
No polymorphisms appeared in black rockfish with any of the
