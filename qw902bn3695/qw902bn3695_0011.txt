Microbial activity.
reflection of differences in lag or induction periods or
an indication that a variety of uptake mechanisms are in-
volved.
Since oxygen consumption was used as an index of car¬
bon mineralization, no statement can be made about the actual
uptake mechanisms involved in this reaction.
Significant sulfate reduction was observed at only one
substrate concentration, see figure 12. Further experi¬
mentation at higher substrate concentrations would be
necessary before any statement could be make about the up-
take mechanisms involved.
The results obtained under controlled experimental
conditions during this study cannot be considered good
indices of actual rates in situ. For example, the lag or
induction period observed for the nitrification reaction
can be regarded as an indication that the assay method
devised does not allou measurement of the in situ rate,
uhich may be very lou. Only the establishment of exper¬
imental conditions brings forth the observed production
of nitrite. Similarly, objections can be raised to any
attempt at comparing laboratoryand in situ rates for the
carbon mineralization and sulfate reduction reactions.
Houever, if the results are considered as indicative
of changing microbial activity in relation to depth and/or
sand color, a general picture emerges. First of all, the
anaerobic conditions of the black sand layer may be largely
a reflection of the higher numbers of bacteria found there
