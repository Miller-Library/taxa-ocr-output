Wicrobial activity.
Uncertain at best. Nevertheless, a comparison of experimental
results obtained for different samples should give information
as to the relative amounts of microbial activity occurring
at different depths in the sand and with reference to the
black sulfide layer.
Conversions representative of three biogeochemical steps
were chosen for investigation. These were:
1)
Heterotrophic assimilation and conversion of
organic carbon or mineralization by respir-
ation.
(CH,O) + 0, - co, + H,O
2) Nitrification.
NHNO
3) Sulfate reduction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lollection and initial preparation of sand samples.
Sand samples were collected through the use of a poly-
vinylchloride, PVC, coring device. Cores 40 cm. in length
Uere obtained and used for analysis. Due to the large number
of analyses required per sand sample, work proceeded on only
one sample at a time.
Removal of sand from the coring device took place in
the laboratory, and the resulting core uas immediately divided
into four equal portions 10 cm. in length. Each portion
of the sample corresponded to 10 cm. in vertical core depth.
