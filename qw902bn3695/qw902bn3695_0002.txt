Microbial activity.
INTRODUCTION
Although extensive examination of microbial populations
and activities in waters and sediments has been carried
out, there are many unanswered questions and unsolved probÂ¬
lems. Perhaps the least investigated aspect of microbial
activity has been the attempt to describe in situ nutrient
conversion rates. The most definitive studies up to the
present have concerned themselves with the heterotrophic
metabolism of organic nutrients such as glucose and acetate
(Uright and Hobbie, 1965; Harrison, Uright, and Morita, 1971).
Investigation of other important biogeochemical conversions
has proceeded much more slouly, especially in the marine
environment. Houever, recently interest in a variety of these
conversions has groun and a study of several conversions in
the sediments of Monterey Bay is currently underway (J. H.
Phillips, personal communication, 1972.).
This particular study was undertaken in an attempt
to measure microbial activity in beach sand, paying par-
ticular attention to its relationship to the commonly found
black sulfide layer. The primary difficulty encountered
in such a study is that no suitable procedure exists for
the direct measurement of microbial activity in the field.
Assay methods must be devised which allow for the measurement
of conversion rates under controlled laboratory conditions.
Hopefully, such methods will yield results which can be
considered good indices of the activities occurring in situ.
However, such an extrapolation can only be regarded as
