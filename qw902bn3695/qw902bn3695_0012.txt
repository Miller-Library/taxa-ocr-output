capable of aerobic respiration. The more rapid removal of
oxygen possible in such a highly populated region permits
sulfide production to proceed by allowing anaerobic respir-
ation to occur. Secondly, the high substrate threshold
observed for the sulfate reduction reaction may also re-
flect the large and active population of aerobic respiring
forms inhabiting the black sulfide layer. Even with lou
concentrations of available oxygen, aerobic forms may simply
leave little, of any, substrate available for the sulfate
reducers to utilize. Lastly, the activity distribution of
bacteria involved in the nitrification process differs from
those that are involved with mineralization of dissolved
organic carbon. These results suggest that the autotrophic
and heterotrophic micro-organisms have different vertical
distributions within beach sand.
SUMMARY
1) This study was an attempt to measure microbial
activity in beach sand with respect to the black sulfide-
containing layer. The conversions studied were carbon
mineralization by respiration, nitrification, and sulfate
reduction.
2) Changes in microbial activity with respect to depth
and substrate concentration were observed.
3) The changes in microbial activity for any particular
substrate concentration were primarily correlated with
differences in sand color, an index of changing physical
