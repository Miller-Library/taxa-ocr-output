Microbial activity.
Calculation of nitrification rates did not involve a cor-
rection for this lag period.
Results for sulfide production were obtained only from
core 2. Little of no sulfide production occurred below a
substrate concentration of 400 pg-at sodium acetate-C/t..
see figure 12. Data obtained for this substrate concentration
indicates a possible correlation of rate with sand color.
see figure 13.
DISCUSSION
The ubiquitous black sulfide-containing layer in beach
sand has been characterized as a region of lower oxidationÂ¬
reduction potential and louer pH than overlying layers uhile
having high concentrations of metallic sulfides and a low
concentration or complete lack of oxygen (Baas Becking.
Uood, and Kaplan,1957; Perkins, 1957). It can be hypothesized
that these differences in physical and chemical conditions
will be reflected by differences in the microbial pop-
ulations uhich inhabit the different layers. If such variations
do in fact exist, differences in microbial activity should
be evident.
Although only a limited amount of data was collected
and analyzed during this study, it appears that significant
differences in microbial populations, as reflected by activity
data, do exist as a function of sand depth. These differences
are related to differences in sand color, an index of changing
physical and chemical conditions.
