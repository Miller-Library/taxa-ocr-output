Microbial activity.
ABSTRACT
An attempt was made to measure microbial activity
in beach sand in relation to the black sulfide-containing
layer. Ihree biogeochemical conversions were investigated.
Changes in microbial activity as a function of sand depth
were observed and found to be primarily correlated with
differences in sand color. Conversion rates as determined
in the laboratory were found not to be good indices of
in situ activity. However, since all results were com-
parative, they were able to give information about general
activity distributions. Not only was anaerobic respiration
involving sulfide production most pronounced in sands conÂ¬
taining high amounts of sulfide, aerobic respiration was
also greatest in this type of sand. On the other hand.
the most rapid rates for autotrophic conversion of ammonia
to nitrite were not associated with sulfide-rich sands.
