Microbial activity.
The results indicate a positive correlation between
the rate of oxygen consumption and darkness of sand coloration.
The higher rates observed in darkly colored sand indicate
that larger populations of heterotrophs capable of miner-
alization reside there despite the anaerobic conditions.
Not enough data was obtained for the sulfate reduction
reaction to conclude anything definite about reaction rate
Vs. sand color. There appears to be an increase in rate
with darkening sand color, possibly indicating a population
increase in sulfate reducing bacteria, but no definitive
statement as to rate can be made without further experimentation.
A negative correlation between rate of nitrification
and increasing darkness of sand was observed, see table 2.
This reflects a decrease in the population of nitrifying
bacteria and indicates that the conditions characteristic
of the black band are not favorable for these bacteria.
Data for reaction rate vs. substrate concentration can
be used to give an estimate of in situ activity and infor-
mation about the actual mechanisms of nutrient uptake
(Uright and Hobbie, 1966).
No saturation effect on the rate of nitrification was
observed for increasing substrate concentration, see figures
7 and 8. This seems to indicate an uptake mechanism governed
by simple diffusion (Uright and Hobbie, 1966). Houever,
a closer examination of figures 7 and 8 reveals that a linear
relationship doesn't exist between reaction rate and substrate
concentration in very dark sand. This may simply be a
