Erlenmeyer flask for titration.
Nitrite production was measured as an index of nitri-
fication. Incubation was terminated by Millipore filtration
and nitrite determined by the method of Strickland and
Parsons (Strickland and Parsons, 1968). The estimate of
precision was + 0.3 ug-at NO,-N/L., and linearity permitted
use of a factor of 19.7 x (0.D.).
Sulfide production was measured as an index of sulfate
reduction. Sulfide was determined by the method of Strick-
land and Parsons (Strickland and Parsons, 1968). The
estimate of precision uas + 1.7 ug-at H,S-S/L., and linearity
permitted use of a factor of 43.1 x (0.D.).
Calculation of conversion rates.
Rates were calculated using the following equation:
V/Liter of sand = C/T x 500 where,
V - reaction rate.
C = change in concentration, in ug-at/.,
of substance being assayed.
I - time of incubation in hours.
