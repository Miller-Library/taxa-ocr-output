substantiate the preliminary observations that oxygen con-
sumption rates show a general increase with depth and sub¬
strate concentration.
Although oxygen consumption rates shou a general increase
with depth, the primary correlation is uith sand color.
lable 1 compares the rates of oxygen consumption, at a
representative substrate concentration, with sand color in
the tuo cores and shous that higher rates seem to be correlated
with darker color. This relationship holds true even after
correction for chemical oxidation. Those portions of the
tuo cores having similar coloration have similar uncorrected
oxygen consumption rates.
Figures 7 and 8 show that the rate of nitrification
in all four portions of the two cores increases with sub-
strate concentration. Figures 9 and 10 indicate a decrease
in the rates of nitrification with depth. As with oxygen
consumption, the primary correlation appears to be with sand
color. Table 2 compares nitrification rates, at a repre-
sentative substrate concentration, with sand color in the
tuo cores and shous that lower rates seem to be correlated
with darker color. Similar rates are observed in those
portions of the tuo cores having similar coloration.
A time course experiment on sand from core 2 was run
to determine whether or not a significant lag or induction
period existed for the nitrification reaction. Figure 11
indicates that a 48—-72 hr. induction period was present.
