and chemical conditions.
The rates of the carbon miner-
alization and the sulfate reduction reactions increased
Uith increasing darkness of sand coloration. The rate of
nitrification showed the opposite trend.
4) Conversion rates as determined under controlled
laboratory conditions were found not to be good indices
of in situ activity. However, since the results were
comparative, they were able to give insight as to relative
amounts of microbial activity at different depths in the
sand and with respect to the black sulfide layer.
5) The microbial activity patterns observed in this
study seem to indicate that the black sulfide-containing
layer is established and maintained actively by internally
based processes as well as passively by external influences.
