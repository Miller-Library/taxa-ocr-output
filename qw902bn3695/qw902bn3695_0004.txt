Microbial activity.
Each portion was slurried with 2.5 volumes of Artificial
Sea Uater (Maclead, Onofrey, and Norris, 1954) to homoÂ¬
genize and alloued to settle. Supernatants were decanted
and saved.
Preparation of samples for incubation
2.0 m1. aliquots of the settled sand were transferred
to individual reaction flasks along with 5.0 ml. of the
appropriate supernatant containing fine suspended material.
Incubation of samples to be assayed for carbon miner-
alization was carried out in 60 ml. glass-stoppered reagent
bottles. 1.0 ml. of substrate at the desired concentration
was introduced into each bottle and air-saturated Artificial
Sea Uater, ASU, added until overflowing. Each bottle was
stoppered to create a closed aerobic system and inverted
tuice to mix substrate and sand.
Incubation of samples to be assayed for nitrification
was carried out in 50 ml. Erlenmeyer flasks. Air-saturated
ASU uas added to each flask to bring the total volume up to
29 ml. excluding sand volume. 1.0 ml. of substrate at the
desired concentration was added, and the solution swirled
to ensure complete mixing.
Samples to be assayed for sulfate reduction were incu-
bated in 30 ml. reagent bottles. Nitrogen-flushed ASU was
added to bring the total volume up to 29 ml. excluding sand
volume, and the bottles capped with rubber vaccine stoppers.
The bottles were flushed out with nitrogen gas to create
completely anaerobic conditions, and 1.0 ml. of substrate
