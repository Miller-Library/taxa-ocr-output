at the desired contration added by means of a syringe. Each
bottle was inverted twice to ensure complete mixing.
luo replicates at each substrate concentration were
prepared. The concentration ranges utilized were as follous:
1) Carbon mineralization: 0, 10, 25, 50 po-at
sodium acetate-C/L.
2) Nitrification: 0, 25, 50, 100 ug-at NH,CI-N/L.
3) Sulfate reduction: 0, 100, 200, 400 uo-at
sodium acetate-C/L.
Incubation of samples.
Samples were incubated in the dark at a temperature
uhich varied from 14.8--15.5'C. Optimal incubation times
uere determined by experimentation and were as follows;
carbon mineralization, 30â€”-48 hrs.; nitrification, 124 hrs.:
sulfate reduction, 96 hrs. Zero time determinations were
made as uell.
lermination of incubation and chemical assays.
Uxygen consumption was measured as an index of acetate
mineralization. Dissolved oxygen was determined by means
of the Chesapeake Bay Institute's technique for the Uinkler
method (Carpenter, 1965) except for the follouing modi-
