collected at 1300 hrs. on May 9°" at an approximate tidal
height of + 2.0 feet. Core 2 was collected at 900 hrs. on
May 18" at an approximate tidal height of + 2.5 feet.
Qualitative differences between the two cores were
observed. Core 1 had broun sand to a depth of 17 cm. At
this point the sand acquired a definite grayish tinge which
darkened with depth. Belou a depth of 30 cm., the sand was
dark gray in color. Core 2 was broun to a depth of 14 cm.
At this depth the sand had a slight grayish tinge which darkened wi
depth. Below a depth of 19 cm. the sand was dark gray except
for a distinct black band at 22--24 cm.
After homogenation with ASU to prepare for analysis,
the cores had the following coloration:

Figures 1—-4 depict the results obtained from the assays
for oxygen consumption. In both cores the rates of oxygen
consumption shou an increase with increasing substrate
concentration, see figures 1 and 2. The rates of oxygen
consumption also increasecas a function of depth, see figures
3 and 4. To correct for non-biological consumption of oxygen
due to chemical oxidation (e.g., Fes, - Fe.0), a sample
sterilized under nitrogen was tested for oxygen consumption.
In this manner values for chemical oxidation were obtained
and corrected biochemical oxygen consumption rates could
