DISCUSSION
In all experiments Acmaca scabra survived high temperatures,
in both air and water, better than did Acmaea digitalis. These
differences betwcen the two species correlates with the higher mean
microhabitat temperatures which were found. Haven (1964) has observed
that A. scabra is seen in greatest abundance on surfaces which are
more horiz√∂ntal than the areas of highest A. digitalis concentration.
This also correlates well with the observed lethal temperatures,
since A. scabra would therefore receiw more and stronger sunlight
than would A. digitalis.
The observed intraspecific differences in ability to survive
high temperatures possibly result from temperature acclimation.
Thus, even though the high and low members within each species
experience much the same temperatures, the higher members would
experience any high temperatures for longer periods of time than
their lower counterparts. An alternative explanation, not involving
temperature acclimation, is that the greater resistance of the higher

animals having larger shells than lower animals, and the work
of Frank (1965), which showed that A. digitalis move higher
in the intertidal zone with age. However, these results do
not establish a causal relationship between size and ability
to withstand high temperatures, and further research ig
pLanned.
The intraspecific differences in ability to survive high temp-
eratures were much less clear in the prolonged temperaturc trials.
