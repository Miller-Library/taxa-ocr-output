15°C. in the laboratory and used within 24 hours.
Two types of laboratory experiments were conducted to determine
lethal temperatures. The first type was run with the animals sub-

at a rate of fC. per 5 minutes, to allow for complete equilibration
of theeinternal and external temperatures of the animals (Southward,
1958). Fifteen high, mid, and low members of each species were
removed at l intervals, at the indicated temperatures and replaced
in running sea water at 15°C. The animals were allowed to recover
for 6-12 hours and checked for survival by pricking the mantle fold
with a needle. If no response was elicited, the animal was considered
dead.
The second type of experiment tested the animals' abilities to
survive prolonged exposure to higher than normal temperatures in air,
