HARDIN, DANE D. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University,
Pacific Grove, Calif.). A Comparative Study of Lethal Temperatures
in the Limpets Acmaea scabra and Acmaea digitalis (Mollusca:
Gastropoda: Prosobranchia).
The lethal temperatures of two specics of limpets which occupy the samc intertidal
levels were studied. It was found that A. scabra (with a critical range of 40-44 c)
is better able to withstand high tomperatures than is A. digitalis(with a critical
range of 39-42'C). Concurrent field studics showed that A. scabra experiences higher
microhabitat and body temperatures than docs A. digitalis at similar air temperatures.
It was found that the limpets' body temperatures were 2-6 higher than surrounding ex-
ternal temperatures. Intraspecific differences in temperature tolerance were also-
found, with the highest intertidal members of eachespecics:surviving better thancthe
lowest members. Possible causes of intraspecific differences arc acclimation or
size of the animal.
