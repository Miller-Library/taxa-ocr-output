There may also be differences between different species which are
found at the same intertidal levels.
This study was undertaken in an attempt to answer threc main
questions: 1) Is there a difference in lethal temperatures of
and hodr stae
animals of the same species,taken from different tidal levels?
2) Is there a difference between lethal temperatures of two species
occupying the same intertidal levels? 3) How does an organism's
lethal temperature relate to the temperature of its microhabitat?
The organisms used in this study, the limpets Acmaea digitalis
Eschscholtz, 1833, and Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1846), are ideal for
rer wa
answering these question, since they occupy the same range in the
intertidal zone (-2 to +10 feet) along the central California coast
(Test, 1945).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The members of cach species were collected from areas visibly
dominated by one or the other (at Point Pinos and Mussel Point on
the Monterey Peninsula) in order that the results gained by lab-
oratory experiments would be as representative as possible of the
normal population.
For the purposes of testing intraspecific differencesiinilethal
temperatures with respect to differences in intertidal location.
animals were taken from the extreme upper (above +7.0 feet) and
lower (below +4.5 fect) limits of the species in that area, and
from a region midway between. Teineurethatthe animaie seliete
