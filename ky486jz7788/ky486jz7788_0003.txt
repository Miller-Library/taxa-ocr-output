A Comparative Study of Lethal Temperatures
in the Limpets Acmaea scabra and Acmaca digitalis
Dane D. Hardin
INTRODUCTION
The importance of temperature as a limiting factor for the gco-
graphical distribution of intertidal animals is generally recog-
nized (Moorc, 1958). Many studies have been conducted in an effort
to correlate the distribution of some intertidal organisms with
among them
either air or sea temperature,y those of Hutchins (1947).
Southward (1950), and Southward and Crisp (1954). Segal (1956, 1961.
1962) has indicated that there is a difference between the highest and lowes
intertidal members of Acmaea limatula Carpenter, 1864,and tha lem-
att with respect to such body functions as heart rate and
oxygen consumption. Intraspecific differences in these processes
have also been detected in animals from different latitudes. Segal
has further demonstrated that these differences are a possible effect
of temperature and that acciimation of the processes to different
tidal levels takes place.
Studies have also been conducted to determinc the lethal temp-

and Hayeo, ayr However these investigations have
not dealt satisfactorily with intraspecific variation or niche
difference. For instance, there may be a difference between lethal
temperatures of members of a single species from the extreme boundaries
ofits vertical intertidal distribution at a single latitude.
