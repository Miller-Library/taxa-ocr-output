Acmaca digitalis, and the higher members of each species consistently
survived better than did the lower intertidal animals.
The results of the prolonged temperature trials are shown in
Figures 2 and 3. There is no figure for the 34 trial as no indi-
Hlrough
viduals of either species survived this temperature. At 20 and24.
Acmaea scabra continued to survive better than Acmaca digitalis+ 29 and 37.5
the intraspecific diffcrences seen in the submerged trials
are less evident.
To check any possible correlations between size and survival.
shell dimensions of all animals used in the submerged temperature
experiments were determined with vernier calipers readable to 0.Olcm.
Twenty individuals from each group were randomly chosen, (by random
selection of pieces of paper containing data on each individual).
and the respective size distributions are shown in Table 1. The
data show a marked tendency for the low intertidal group to be
smaller than the high intertidal group.
The mean temperatures for 10 randomly selected limpets are
represented in each graph of Figure 4. Acmaca scabra consistently
exhibited higher microhabitat temperatures than did Acmaea digitalis
at similar air temperatures. It can also be seen that in all cases
the actual temperature of the limpet (mantle cavity temperature) is
higher than the microhabitat temperatures. No significant temper-
aturc differences of any of the measured variables were found
between the upper and lower areas(the temperatures were taken from
+3 to 47 feet).
