and
This was especially evident with Acmaca digitalisThie can
possibly be traced to the fact that even though the A. digitalis
population presents a size continuum(with the smallest animals
lowest in the intertidal zone and the largest animals highest)
this species is probably more mobile than Acmaea scabra. This
results in part from the greater percentage of homing behavior
found in A. scabra than in A. digitalis (Haven, 1964; Jessee, 1966;
Miller, 1966). It can be expected thereforc, that the effects of
acclimation would be more clearly defined in a population of ani-
mals which remain in rather fixed positions. This agrees with the
greater intraspecifec differences in survival at high temperaturess
seen in A. scabra.
