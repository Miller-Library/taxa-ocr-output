was raised at the previously mentioned rate until the desired temp-
erature was reached. The animals were held at this temperature
(#0.3), with 15 animals from each species and each intertidal level
being removed a 5, 10, and 15 hours. Trials were run at 29, 31.5.
and 34. After each time period the removed animals were replaced
in running sea water at 15Â°C., and tested as above after 6-12 hours.
Field temperatures encountered by the two species were taken
eween
on several days-at 12-4:0Opmat Mussel Point. Temperatures were
taken with a portable thermistor (model 43TD Yellow Springs Tele-
Thermometer). Five readings were recorded: 1) air temperature
2-3cm. above the animal, 2) rock temperature next to the limpet,
3) the temperature on the surface of the animal's, shelle4) the temper-
ature beneath the animal's foot, and 5) the temperature within the
limpet's mantle cavity. The air, rock, and shell temperatures were
taken with a banjo-type probe, model 409, which was kept shaded to
prevent heating by direct sunlight. The foot and mantle cavity
temperatures were taken with a 716 inch flexible probe, model 402.
The foot and mantle cavity temperatures were taken in situ. Bach
animal was lifted from the rock, the probe was placed under the
foot or in the mantle cavity, and the animal returned to the spot
from which it was taken. The limpet was then held in place with the
blade of a knife and the temperature read-out recorded.
