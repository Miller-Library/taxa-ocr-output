SUMMARY
Lethal temperatures of the limpets Acmaca scabra and Acmaea
digitalis were studied. A. scabra was found to survive high temp-
eratures better than A. digitalis. These results correlate with
field studies which showed that A. scabra experiences higher micro-
habitat and body temperatures than does A. digitalis at similar temp-
eratures. It was also found that the internai temperatures of limpets
are consistently above the external surrounding temperatures.
Members of the species coming from the highest intertidal ranges
of the species were found to survive high temperatures better than
members from the lowest intertidal ranges of the species. These
intraspecific differences may be a result of acclimation to the
length of exposure to high environmental temperatures and there are
indications that the size and/or age of a limpet may have an effect
on its ability to survive high temperatures.
