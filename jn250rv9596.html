Introduction
The alteration of body color in an isopod through the concentration
and dispersal of pigments in chromatophores was first seen in
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Idotea tricuspidata : Exact'>Idotea tricuspidata</span> by Matzdorff (1883). Menke (1914) later found
this species to exhibit a diurnal rhythm of color change, the chro¬
matophore pigments being dispersed during the day and punctate at
night. Oguro (1959) demonstrated a persistent diurnal rhythm in
chromatophores in the high intertidal species <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Idotea japonica : PartialExact'>Idotea japonica held</span>
in constant darkness. The present study was undertaken to determine
the behavior of chromatophores of a subtidal isopod, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Idotea resecata : Exact'>Idotea resecata,</span>
under different conditions of illumination and background coloration.
Idotea resecata occurs in two color varieties, green and brown
(lee and Gilchrist 1972). Only the brown form, which occurs
exclusively on the brown alga <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>Macrocystis,</span> was used. Animals were
collected from the kelp beds off Mussel Point in Monterey Bay,
California, and maintained until used on the kelp Macrocystis in
large outdoor tanks at the Hopkins Marine Station. The brown
chromatophores of the dorsal side of the pleotelson are easily seen
with the aid of a dissecting microscope, and were therefore chosen
for study. Degree of dispersal of pigment in the chromatophores
was rated using the 5 point scale of Hogben and Slome (1931), where
stage I indicates maximum concentration of pigment, stage 5 indicates
maximum dispersion, and stages 2, 3, and 4 represent intermediate
conditions (fig. 1b). Chromatophores of the pleotelson were generally
all in the same stage of dispersion and rating therefore represents
all the chromatophores of the pleotelson. Values of 1.5. 2.5. 3.5.
and 4.5 were assigned in cases where chromatophores were at stages
Chromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 3.
intermediate between those defined by Hogben and Slome (1931). In
cases where chromatophores in different stages of dispersion were
present at the same time, a subjective judgement was made as to
the relative abundance of each stage in the posterior region of
the pleotelson, and intermediate values were again used. Increments
smaller than 0.5 were not used. Ratings for a sample of 15 animals
could be completed in less than 5 minutes. The black chromatophores
which were often present around the edge of the pleotelson and
occasionally found around spots on the pleotelson which contained
no chromatophores, were not rated. White chromatophores which were
occasionally found on the pleotelson were also not rated.
All light intensities were measured with a Photovolt 200M
light meter. For intensities over 2 ft-c., a 25% neutral density
filter was placed over the meter.
Both male and female isopods, ranging in length from 15mm to
3Omm, were used in the experiments.
Behavior of chromatophores in a natural light regime.
Initial experiments were made to determine the behavior of
chromatophores under normal day and night light condition. Lots
of twelve animals each were placed in; (1) a black enamaled pan,
(2) a white enamaled pan, and (3) a pan with a gray background.
The pans were exposed to daylight but not direct sunlight. Animals
were not fed during the experiment, and sea water in the pans was
changed every 4 hours. The temperature of the water remained
constant at 14 C. Chromatophores were observed at intervals of
4 to 6 hours over a 3 day period. Figure I shows the results:
under a normal day/night light regime, chromatophore pigments were

dispersed during the day and concentrated at night. During the
day pigments were significantly more dispersed in animals on a
black background than in those on a white background; animals on
the gray substratum were intermediate in pigment dispersion.
Behavior of chromatophores under constant condition of illumination
The following experiments were carried out to determine whether
expansion and contraction of chromatophore pigments persists under
conditions of constant light or darkness. Three pans, each
containing 12 animals, were kept in the dark for a total of 72
hours. During this time, chromatophores of all animals were
examined with the aid of a dissecting scope and low intensity light
every 4 hours. Temperature ranged from 14°C to 17°C during the
experiment. The results (fig. 2c) show that pigments were punctate
at night and dispersed during the day. These results are in good
agreement with the observations of Oguro (1959) on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Idotea japonica : Exact'>Idotea japonica</span>
and Kleinholz (1937) on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ligia baudiniana : Exact'>Ligia baudiniana.</span>
A second group of isopods was kept under conditions of constant
low intensity illumination provided by a 15 watt incandescent
light bulb. Fifteen animals were placed in a shallow black pan
and another 15 in a white pan. Light intensity was held at 0.04
ft-c. except when the chromatophores were being observed. Animals
were checked every 4 to 8 hours over a 60 hour period. The results
(fig. 2a) show that on both backgrounds the chromatophore rhythm
persisted. This experiment was repeated once so that a total of
30 animals were looked at on each colored substrate.
A third group of animals was kept under conditions of constant
Chromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 5.
strong light. Twelve isopods were placed in a black pan and another
12 in a white pan, and both pans illuminated at 40 ft-c. by a
60 watt incandescent light bulb. Chromatophores were observed
every 4 hours. The results (fig. 2a) show no diurnal rhythm in
movement of chromatophore pigments; chromatophores remain expanded,
those on the black background exhibiting greater pigment dispersal
than those on the white background.
Evidence of an endogenous rhythm in chromatophore pigment dispersal
The preceding experiment shows that the rhythmic movement of
pigments in chromatophores persists in the absence of a light
stimulus, suggesting an endogenous rhythm is involved. If this is
indeed the case, one might expect that under prolonged monotonous
conditions, the biological clocks of individual isopods would
begin to get out of phase with one another. In order to determine
whether this occurred, ten isopods were selected and placed in pairs
into petri dishes containing seawater. Each dish contained one
animal in the 20-30mm range and one in the 15-20mm size range.
The dishes were wrapped with aluminum foil and placed in a light¬
tight box whose inside temperature remained relatively constant at
14°C throughout the experiment. The chromatophores of these isopods
were examined in dim light every 4 hours for a 4 day period, and
quickly returned to the dark. No significant asynchrony developed
during this period (fig. 3a) but the maximum degree of dispersion
of chromatophore pigments increased on successive days. A gradual
decrease in the degree of pigment concentration at night was also
indicated.

lore Behavior in  resecata. p. 6.
In order to see what might occur in more prolonged periods of
darkness, a total of 36 animals was kept in the dark in 3 containers
holding 12 isopods each. The containers were made light-tight
with aluminum foil, and placed under a light tight box. Water
In each container, and a small piece of Macrocystis added for food,
was changed every 24 hours. Animals were observed briefly in
dim light only at noon and midnight, and their chromatophores
rated. The results (fig.3b) show a rise in the amount of pigment
dispersion at 1200 hours for the first 4 days, while all chromato¬
phores were essentially punctate at night during this period.
From day 7, the amount of dispersion at 1200 hours stabilized at
approximately the 3.0 level while a gradual decrease in the degree
of concentration of pigment at 2400 hours was observed. By the
19th day the mean chromatophore ratings at 1200 and 2400 hours
were observed to level off in the 2.5 to 3.5 range. Twelve animals
died during the course of this experiment, mainly due to canibalism.
At the end of the 19th day, 8 of the surviving animals were selected.
placed in separate petri dishes wrapped in aluminum foil, placed
under a light-tight box, and observed every 4 to 6 hours for a
24 hour period. The results for each individual (fig. 4) show that
the reason the mean chromatophore ratings at 1200 and 2400 hours
tended to level off (fig. 3b) was because the endogenous rhythms
of the individual isopods had become out of phase, and also
because in some animals the chromatophores did not exhibit complete
contraction and/or expansion.
Since individuals in this experiment had been examined and
hence illuminated in dim light at least every 12 hours, a second
Unromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 7
experiment was conducted in order to determine if individual
biological clocks get out of phase under conditions of uninterrupted
darkness. Fourteen individuals, all in the 20-30mm length range,
were placed in separate petri dishes wrapped with aluminum foil.
and placed in a light-tight box for 9 days. Food and water were
changed in the absence of light every 24 hours. Temperature was
constant at 14'C through the course of the experiment. On the
tenth day, the chromatophores of each individuals were examined in
dim light at intervals of approximately 2 hours for a 24 hour
period; between observations animals were returned to darkness.
The results (fig. 5, 6a) show that in continued darkness the
chromatophore rhythm of individuals became asynchronous. Both
the time of initiation of pigment dispersal, and the duration of
the period spent in the dispersed state varied between individuals.
Asynchrony is much greater than that exhibited by isopods maintained
on a normal day/night light cycle as controls.
Effect of different intensities of light on chromatophores.
Observations on chromatophore changes during ordinary day/night
light conditions suggest that the chromatophores of l. resecata
respond differently to different light intensities. In its natural
environment 1. resecata is subjected to frequent changes in light
intensity even during the day due to movement of the kelp canopy
with waves and tides, and to movement of the isopods up and down
kelp stipes. The next experiment was designed to test the response
of the chromatophores of 1. resecata to various intensities of
light. All tests were conducted between 2200 and 0200 hours
Chromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 8.
because chromatophores are maximally contracted between those times.
The isopods used were dark-adapted for 4 hours in a plastic pan
of seawater which was wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in a
light-tight box at 14 C. Macrocystis was added to the pan for
food. Immediately before use isopods were checked for maximal
concentration of chromatophore pigments, and only animals with
a stage I concentration of pigments were selected for this experiment.
The selected animals were placed in black finger bowls in lots of
7, exposed to a particular intensity of light for I hour, and
then observed for chromatophore stage. Illumination was provided
by a 15 watt incandescent light bulb; adjustments in intensity
were made by varying the distance between the light source and the
isopods, and by varying the voltage used. Individual animals were
used only once, and the experiment was repeated at each intensity
3-7 times depending on the extent of variation between individuals.
Temperature remained at 12-14°C throughout the one hour period.
The results (fig. 7) show that chromatophore pigments are more
dispersed at higher light intensities than at lower intensities.
Rate of chromatophore expansion and contraction at different times
of day
Menke (1911) claimed that in 1. balthica chromatophores
expanded or contracted at different rates at different times of
the day or night, and that adaptation leading to a more punctate
state was faster at night than during the day because chromatophores
tended toward contraction at night. The following experiment was
designed to determine 1. resecata's ability to adapt to different
Chromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 9.
times of the diel cycle. Four hours prior to each experiment,
30 animals were placed in a pan of seawater which was wrapped in
aluminum foil and placed in a light-tight box. Macrocystis was
placed in the pan for food. Temperature was held constant at
14°0. At the start of the experiment, 15 animals were rated for
chromatophore stage and were then placed in a shallow black bowl.
The other 15 individuals were similarly rated and placed in a
white bowl. Both were then placed under a 60 watt incandescent
bulb providing 40 ft-c. of illumination, and the chromatophores
of each animal were staged every fifteen minutes through the course
of the experiment. When two successive ratings on the animals
in a bowl produced the same results, the backgrounds were reversed
such that animals from the black bowls were placed in white bowls
and vice versa. Animals were again staged every 15 minutes
until successive ratings were the same. This experiment was
conducted twice at each of the following times: 0600, 1200, 1800,
and 2400 hours. Water in the pans was changed at the end of I hour.
The results are shown in figures 8a and 8b. Chromatophore
adjustment from a dark adapted (punctate) state to a black back¬
ground under the experimental conditions takes between 30 and
45 minutes at each time of day (fig. 8a), with the initial rates
of pigment dispersal being the same. For a white background, a
similar adaptation appears to be complete within 15 minutes.
Adaptation after a subsequent switching of backgrounds occurred
within 15 minutes in all cases. Thus it appears that there is no
difference in rate of chromatophore expansion or contraction at
different times of day though the time needed to adapt may vary
depending on the experimental conditions and the initial and final
Chromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 10.
chromatophore stages.  resecata appears to be able to disperse
or concentrate chromatophore pigments with equal speed.
Effect of constant illumination on rate of background adaptation
The diurnal rhythm leading to dispersion of chromatophore
pigments during the day appears to be a mechanism which maintains
body pigmentation in a state so that the animal is at least partially
protectively colored at any given time. The preceeding experiment
indicates that 1. resecata can disperse or contract pigments of
its chromatophores equal speed. A partial dispersion of chromato¬
phore pigments during the day, regardless of whether the animal
is exposed to daylight or not prepares the animal should it
suddenly come our from a dark hiding place into the light, by
reducing the amount of dispersion or contraction of chromatophores
which might be necessary. A sample of 75 1. resecata at 1600 hours
yielded a mean rating of 3.06 with a standard deviation of 1.
These isopods were taken directly from the field and rated as
quickly as possible. The question might also be asked, what is
the advantage of concentrating pigment in chromatophores to a
fully punctate state at night? There seems no obvious advantage
from the stand point of protective coloration. Perhaps a daily
movement of chromatophore pigments to the punctate stae is necessary
in order to maintain an optimal rate of adaptation, i.e. perhaps
chromatophores "need exercise" to keep in good condition. This
hypothesis was tested in a preliminary way by placing 15 animals
in a shallow black pan and another 15 animals in a white pan and
Chromatophore Behavior in 1 resecata. p. 11.
exposing them to a constant illumination of 40 ft-c. for the
entire experiment. No food was placed in the pans and the water
was changed at approximately 8 hour intervals. Temperature in the
pans ranged 14-17 C. Isopods were maintained on their respective
backgrounds for 48 hours, after which time their chromatophores
were rated and their backgrounds switched. Animals were observed
at 15 minute intervals thereafter. Backgrounds were switched
when two successive ratings were the same, which was at O. 90.
and 120 minutes. The experiments was repeated a second time
so that each line in figure 8c represents 30 animals. It appears
that chromatophore contraction in animals going from a black to a
white background after 48 hours of constant illumination procedes
rather more slowly than is normal. Subsequent reswitching from
a black to white backgrounds at 120 minutes resulted in a normal
rate of pigment concentration, and adaptation was essentially
completed within fifteen minutes. These results while not conclusive
suggest the possibility that a secondary function of the diurnal
rhythm of chromatophores is related to a need for daily contraction
or "exercise". Alternatively the results might be explained by
the possible effects of constant illumination on the isopod eye.
Animals illuminated on the white background for 48 hours did not
adapt significantly more slowly to a black background than did
the animals in previous experiments.
Summar
1. Chromatophore pigments in the isopod Idotea resecata are
dispersed during the day and punctate at night under normal day/night
light condition, in constant darkness, and in constant low intensity
Chromatophore Be
light.
2. Under constant strong illumination there is no diurnal rhythm
of movement of chromatophore pigments.
3. Under conditions of prolonged constant darkness individual
sopods become asynchronous in rhythmic chromatophore changes, and the
degree of pigment dispersal and concentration is decreased in some
animals.
4. The degree of expansion or contraction of chromatophores
depends on both background color and light intensity.
5. Rates of change in chromatophores accompanying changes in
background color are constant at all times of the day or night.
6. After constant strong illumination for 48 hours on a black
background, the rate at which isopods adapted to a white back
ground was decreased, while the accompanying switch from white to
black background is unchanged.
