Site III consisted of three rocks close together and of approximately
the same height, with snails clumped at the base of the rocks at low
tide. Each rock had a flat, horizontal top. On each rock,, dispersing
snails climbed up a short vertical face and roamed over the upper
surface. Since the three rocks were subjected to nearly identical
conditions they were condidered together.
Data were taken hourly over a 24 hour period on eight separate
occasions diring the month of May. At each observation the number
of Tegula in each designated area of each site was recorded, as well
as whether that area was dry, washed intermittantly by water, or
submerged. Surge and wave action were rated on a scale of one to
four, ene representing nearly calm conditions and four representing
strong surge. In determining whether an area was to be considered dry,
washed or submerged, a previously dry site was considered washed
when first splashed or wetted by water on a rising tide. An area
was considered submerged only when covered continually by the sea.
More frequent observations had to be made at critical periods of
incoming and outgoing tides when these conditions were rapidly changing.
A plastic tube with a transparent plexiglass bottom was used for
underwater viewing to count smails on areas that were submerged. At
night, a flashlight with an orange filter provided the neccessary light.
-RESULTS-
Figures 1,2, and 3 show the tidal cycle and the number of Tegula
in each of the study sites at each observation. Also shown are the
particular periods when the sites were dry, washed, and submerged, and
an estimate of surge strength. Accurate observations were difficult
or impossible to obtain at high water (see areas marked "no data" on
