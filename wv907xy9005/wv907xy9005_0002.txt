FIELD STUDIES
-METHODS-
Studies were carried out on the north side of Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove, California, during the period May 8-31, 1978. After initial
observations three sites were chosen on the basis of (1) accessibility
at high tide, (2) the presence of numerous Tegula funebralis,
(3) the availability of vertical of sloping rock surfaces on which
the snails could climb, and (4) the consistency with which Tegula
moved on and off those surfaces. At each site the Tegula population
was clustered in crevices and under narrow rock overhangs below the
elevatedrrocks at low tide. As conditions changed, T. funebralis
emerged from hiding and spread outward and upward onto exposed surfaces
permitting periodic counts to be made easily.
Site I was a pyramid-shaped rock with a square base and four
vertical faces. It was approximately 30 cm at the base and 38 cm
high. This rock was divided about halfway to the top into upper and
lower zónes. At low tide Tegula were clustered in the crevice
where the base of the rock met the substrate. As the snails dispersed
they climbed the pyramid, moving into the lower, and then upper zone.
Site II was a flat, steeply sloping rock face on the side of a
large boulder. An area 20 cm high and 110 cm wide was marked on
the face near the base of the boulder. This area was divided into
twoee vertical zones, each about 20 cm. high and 110 cm wide.
At low tide Tegula were hidden underneath the boulder in a narrow
space between the boulder and the underlying rock substrate; in dis¬
persing they climbed up the rock face into the marked areas on the rock
face.
