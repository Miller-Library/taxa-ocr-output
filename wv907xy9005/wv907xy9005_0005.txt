seen that many more snails were present in the study sites at night
than during the day. Nearly all animals dispersed during the day
were awash (or submerged), whereas many of those dispersed during the
night were exposed to air above the swash. Those animals which
were distributed on rocks above the swash zone at night had not moved
up under dry conditions; they had moved up into the study sites
during the previous high tide, and simply had not moved down as the
waters receded.
In summary the results show that in the field, the movement of
Tegula funebralis is positively correlated with the tide cycle.
The dates on which data were taken were chosen in order to portray
all possible relationships between the tidal and diel cycles. In
Figures 1,2, and 3 it is evident that as the time of a high tide gets
later and later in the diel period, so does the corresponding peak of
movement. The basic pattern of movement clearly followsthe tidal
cycle. During dry conditions, Tegula were clustered beneath rocks
and in cracks and crevices. Upon being wetted, Tegula funebralis
moved out over the rock surfaces. The reverse occurred as the tide went
down, the animals retreating to their protected areas when washed and
subsequently left above water. During high tide there were significantly
fewer Tegula on the rocks when the surge and wave action were at their
strongest. There were also clear differences between day and night.
At night, in contrast to the day, not all the snails moved off the rocks
at low tide, and numerous snails were left on rock surfaces which were
neither washed or submerged. It was also shown that Tegula moved out
in larger numbers on the rocks at high tide during night than during
the day.
