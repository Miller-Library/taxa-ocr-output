Tegula began to move back below the rocks. There is no correlation
between movement of Tegula in the tubs under constant submersion and
the events of the tidal cycle present in the field.
-DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSÂ¬
The general finding that Tegula tend to be negatively phototactic
supports the conclusions of Kosin (1964). In Figure 5 it can be seen
that the movement of Tegula from beneath the rocks is more gradual than
the movement back to those protected areas. The tubs were located
on the northeast side of a large building. They received direct sunlight
from sunrise until about 1230 (small tub) or 1430 (large tub). The
animals were thus exposed to a more rapid change in light intensity during
the early morning sunrise than during the late afternoon sunset.
The most rapid change in light intensity occurs at a time when the
animals might be expected to show the greatest dark adaptation.
These findings and the work of Kosin (1964) and Wara and Wright (1964)
support the statement that the diel cycle exerts an important influence
on the movement of Tegula funebralis, although the field data show it
plays a role secondary to that of the tidal rhythm. Surge plays an
important modifying role during periods of strong wave action at high
tide.
No hint of an endogenous rhythm in the movement of Tegula was noted.
No movement correlated with the tide cycle in the animals kept submerged
in the tubs. Kosin (1964) found no evidence of rhythmic behavior in
T. funebralis maintained continually submerged in either continuous
light or continuous darkness. Tegula do show a predictable rhythmic
pattern in their movement, but these data and observations of earlier
researchers suggest that the movementof Tegula occur in response to such
