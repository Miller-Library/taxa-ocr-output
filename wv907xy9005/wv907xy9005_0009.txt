stimuli as changes in moisture (eg. wetting by swash after a dry period),
changes in light, or marked changes in turbulence. Even relatively
small fluctuations in environmental conditions may have an effect.
SUMMARY
1) Studies in the intertidal zone and in outdoor tanks were carried
out at Pacific Grove, California, to determine the movements of
Tegula funebralis and the environmental events correlated most closely
with them. The snails cluster in sheltered areas at low tide especially
during the day.
2) Movement of Tegula funebralis into the open and upward on rocks
is positively correlated with periods when the animals are washed and
submerged.
3) Tegula move upward when awash and submerged during both day and
night high tides, but more snails move up during the night than during
the day.
4) During the day as the tide recedes, Tegula stay below the water
line and retreat back to area where they cluster and remain inactive,
At night, numerous snails are left exposed to air on the rocks as the
tide recedes. Unwetted Tegula do not move up on dry rocks during either
night or day.
5) During periods of high surge, Tegula submerged or awash move
down rock surfaces to protected areas.
6) Tegula constantly submerged in outdoor aquaria showed no evidence
of tidal rhythmicity, but followed a diel cycle of activity. During
most of the day the snails stayed clustered under the rocks. In late
afternoon and evening the snails moved out and climbed up the rocks
and sides of the tanks.
