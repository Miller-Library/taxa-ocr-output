areas in response to a strong current.
STUDIES CONDUCTED IN OUTDOOR TANKS
-METHODS-
In order to study the movement of Tegula funebralis in relation
to the diel cycle in the absence of tidal fluctuations, snails were
exposed to the natural day-night regime but under constant submersion.
Tegula of various sizes were collected from various intertidal sites
at Mussel Point and placed in two fiberglass tubs provided with fresh
flowing seawater. The large tub (91 cm x 91 cm, with a water depth
of 55 cm) contained 212 snails, the smaller tub  cmxcm, with a
water depth of cm) had 100 snails. Rocks from the natural habitat
were placed in the tubs to provide protected areas where the Tegula
could clump together out of view. Ã„fter a 48 hour acclimation period,
observations were made hourly during some of the same 24 hour periods
when field data were being collected. In each tub, animals that could
be seen on the rock surface, the tub bottom, and the tub sides were counted.
-RESULTS-
Under conditions of constant submersion, the movement of Tegula
to and from clusters beneath rocks is clearly related to the diel
cycle. Figure 5 shows the number of snails visible in the tub at
each hour. The tidal cycle shown is that of the sea during the
observations; the tanks showed no know tidal effects. During most
of the day Tegula were hidden beneath the rocks. At approximately
1500 hours they began to move outeon the rock and the tub surfaces
until most of the snails had moved from underneath the rock. Starting
at around 0500 hours the number of visible snails decreased as the
rocks.
