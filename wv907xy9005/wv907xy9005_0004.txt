Figures 1-3). The results obtained were consistent for all three
study sites and can be considered together.
Certain features of the movements of Tegula funebralis show up
very clearly. First, the animals exhibit a tidal rhythmicity. The
snails were clustered and hidden when exposed to air at low tide.
They dispersed from their clusters when wetted, climbed steep slopes
where these were present, and distributed themsleves in the areas which
were washed and then submerged. The snails moved up along with the
rising water level, but did not move up into dry areas ahead of the
advancing swash. At ebbing tides as the water receded and the study
sites were first washed and then subsequently left exposed to dry,
Tegula moved downward out of those areas, back to the crevices and small
caves below. There are two important exceptions to this general scheme.
(1) On the nights of May 17-18 and May 28-29 (Figures 1,2,3) and
May 30-31 (Figures 1 and 3), significant numbers of snails were counted
in study sites which were neither washed nor submerged. (2) During
periods of high surge at high tide, the number of Tegula seen in the
study sites decreased significantly. This can be seen in data taken
on May 22-23 (Figures 1 and 3), May 28-29 (Figures 2 and 3), and
May 30-31 (Figure 1).
In order to compare the amount of movement of the Tegula populations
at night with that during the day, the data from all study sites
were combined (Figure 4). Only the counts made when the animals were
dry or awash were included since data taken at high tide when the animals
were submerged were too incomplete for valid comparison. It can be
