INTRODUCTION
Tegula funebralis (Adams, 1854) is one of the most abundant of
the larger gastropods in the rocky intertidal along California shores.
Clumped together beneath rocks and in crevices at low tide, the animals
periodically move up and outward, littering the open rock surfaces
by the thousands. Some aspects of the movement of Tegula have been
studied by previous researchers. Wara and Wright (1964) studied the
intertidal distribution of populations at Pacific Grove, California,
and watched snails disperse over a two week period in several
environmentally different areas to gain insight into factors which
might influence movement. They found the animals remained in sheltered
areas during daytime high tides byt moved upward on rocks during high
tides at night. Upward movement was diminished in bright moonlight and
under turbulent conditions. Glynn (1965) observed that small T. funebralis
in the Balanus-Endocladia zone move out of their clusters when wetted
and distribute themselves more evenly over the substrate. The
responses of Tegula funebralis to turbulence (Overholser 1964) and
light (Kosin, 1964) have been studied in laboratory experiments.
Yet what is known about the movements of the snails in the field
with respect to diel and tidal cycles is based on qualitative
observations. Thetheepresentustudy the movements of T. funebralis
he Feld
were monitored,to determine what environmental events and/orrconditions
correlate most closely with those movements.
