-DISCUSSION¬
The finding that Tegula move up during daylight high tides modifies
observations made by Wara and Wright (1964) that Tegula move up to rock
tops during high tide only at night. The upward movement is shown here
to be related primarily to the tidal cycle. However, the diel cycle
appears to play a modifying role. This is indicated by the fact that
more snails move up at high tides during the night than during daylight
high tides and the fact that some snails are found high on the rocks above
the swash during night low tides. An important observation in assigning
the diel cycle a role secondary to the tidal cycle in influencing
Tegula movement is that Tegula found on rock surfaces above the swash
at low tide had moved up during the previous high tide and had been
left there. Under similar tidal conditions during the day these
snails would havebbeen "high and dry", but the rocks at night tend
to remain wet for a long time after being exposed to air on a falling
tide. Perhaps the residual moisture on the rocks at night was a suffi¬
cient stimulus to keep some snails out on thetrocks. This is consistent
with the general conclusion that Tegula movement is dependent primarily
on moisture and perhaps only secondarily on light or factors whose
variation is correlated with light. Field observations by Glynn (1965)
and Hewatt (1934) show that there is an increase in feeding activity of
Tegula at night. Increased numbers at night during all conditions
would then correlate with an increase in feeding activity.
Although taking counts of Tegula in the field at times of strong
surge and wave action is often impossible, the results that were obtained
agree with laboratory studies by Overholser (1964) and field observations
