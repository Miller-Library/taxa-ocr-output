Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Given that rhodamine is a substrate of the MDR, assaying the
medium for increased rhodamine fluorescence over time analyzes
MDR's efflux rate. Using a competitive inhibitor of MDR, verapamil
other studies (Cornwall et al, 1995) have shown that rhodamine is an
MDR substrate in Mytilus gill, since addition of verapamil to gill tissue
slows the rate at which rhodamine is effluxed from the tissues.
Hence, rhodamine transport is used here to quantify transporter
function.
Rhodamine transport was analyzed using fluorometry. The medium
into which rhodamine-loaded tissues effluxed the dye was sampled for
its fluorescence over time. The slope of the resulting log-transformed
line was taken to represent the rate, and efflux rates were compared
between mussel gill tissues from the different treatment groups.
Statistical analyses by ANCOVA of the first-order efflux rates
treatment groups following one-week exposures showed no differences.
Given that no inhibitor was used in this assay, one could question
whether the rhodamine efflux observed might not actually be a result
of diffusion rather than MDR transport. However, the data still
suggest that there has been no induction for two reasons. First of all,
as other researchers have shown, large changes in substrate
concentrations such as those observed, are unlikely to be due to the
slow process of diffusion alone (Bornmann and Roepe, 1994). Yet, it
would be good to explore this possibility further. Roepe conducted
