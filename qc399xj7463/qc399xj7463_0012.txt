Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Again, the slope of the log-transformed linear regression from figure
8 for each treatment type was divided by the slope of the line for the
FSW control (Figure 8) to give a ratio of efflux rate relative to standard.
The ratios are approximately 1 for 2AAF and 3MC each relative to
control; no significant difference is seen (Figure 9). DMSO treatment
(carrier control) resulted in an efflux rate 1.33 times as fast as the
FSW control (Figure 9). This difference was statistically significant,
p-0.000.
Discussion
Whether the MDR system can be induced by exposure to toxins /
substrates is a much debated issue. Previous reports by a number of
researchers have suggested inducibility in a variety of cell types and
with a variety of substances, the most potent of which include 2AAF
and 3MC (Thorgeirsson et al., 1991; Gant et al., 1991; Schrenk et al.,
1994; Gant et al., 1995). Kurelec observed induction with diesel oil in
the mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, after 3 days of exposure (Kurelec,
1995). However, the present work suggests that 1 to 3 week exposures
of mussels of the related species, M. californianus, to 5 uM 3MC or 10
UM 2AAF are insufficient to cause induction of the MDR protein.
Analysis by Western Blot using the C219 mammalian monoclonal
antibody confirmed the presence of MDR in the mussel, Mytilus
californianus. This is consistent with previous studies in this species
