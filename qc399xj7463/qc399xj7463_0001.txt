Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Abstract
Mussels of the species, Mytilus californianus, are know to have a
multidrug-resistance transport protein (p-glycoprotein, MDR) analogous
to the multidrug resistance protein found in many human tumor cell
lines, which protectively transports a wide range of moderately
hydrophobic and potentially toxic compounds out of cells. Previous
studies have suggested the transporter may be inducible by exposure
to environmental toxins. The present study examined whether
exposure to toxic compounds would induce mussels to increase
synthesis or activity of p-glycoprotein. After exposing animals for 1-3
weeks to two model genotoxic compounds, 2-Acetylaminofluorene and
3-Methylcholanthrene, gill tissues were analyzed by Western Blot to
quantify protein levels. In addition, two assays analyzing the efflux
rates of a fluorescent p-glycoprotein substrate were employed in order
to study the kinetics of the transporter's activity. Results of the
kinetics assays showed no significant difference between control
organisms and exposed organisms in rates of efflux of the fluorescent
substrate (ANCÃ–VA: p=0.924, p=0.357). Western analyses to date have
been inconclusive. Thus, this study does not show significant
inductive effects of exposures to non-lethal levels of genotoxin.
