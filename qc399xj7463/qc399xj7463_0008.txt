Westem Blot Analyses: Confirming the presence of MDR
Analysis by Western Blot confirmed the presence of MDR in M.
californianus. The MDR was present in visibly higher concentrations in
the mussel tissue than in the positive control, DX5 (a tumor cell line
which overexpresses the MDR phenotype), when 40 ug of total protein
was analyzed. Moreover, MDR was highly enriched in a sample of
membrane vesicles isolated from Mytilus tissue with respect to whole
tissue homogenates. High concentrations of MDR were found in all
tissue samples after one week exposure to toxins. However, no
significant difference was seen between these samples and control
samples taken from animals exposed to FSW for the same amount of
time.
Figure 1 shows the results of initial studies of tissue samples by
Western Blot. Lane 4 (left-to-right) shows the MDR protein (170 kDa
band) highly enriched in the membrane vesicles preparation compared
to the DX5 cell line in lane 3, as well as the tissue homogenates
(lanes 6 & 7).
