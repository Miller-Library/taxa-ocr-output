Figure 4. Fluoresence of media over time, following Ihr incubation of gill tissue in 5
UM rhodamine dye. Tissue from three exposed animals were used for each sample.
Data points represent logs of emission intesnities at 579 nm averaged over 2
samples per treatment. The slope of the regression lines represents efflux rate. No
significant difference was seen between slopes of standard (black line, squares),
DMSÃ– (x's, dashed line), 2-AAF (open circles, dotted line), or 3MC (diamonds, grey
line) treatments, ANCOVA p=0.924. Dashed line with dots, filled squares =
standard; dotted line, circles = 2-AAF; dashed line, X's = DMSO; plain line, diamonds
= 3MC.
