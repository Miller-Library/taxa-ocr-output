Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
by the specific substrates of the system. For example, the cytochrome
p450 system is induced upon exposure to its specific substrates
(Thorgeirrson et al., 1991). However, given the ubiquitous nature of p-
glycoprotein, it may be possible that an inducer need not be a
substrate of the system. For example, Chaudhary and Roninson found
that exposure of human tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs which
were not substrates of the MDR system caused induction (Chaudhary
& Roninson, 1993). Ã–ther studies suggest that MDR induction may be
part of a more general stress-response mechanism. Chin et al. (1990)
found increased MDR expression in two human renal carcinoma lines
in response to injections of heat-shock proteins. This result has not
been confirmed. Thus it remains to be seen what mediates MDR
expression and induction - whether it is mediated by a general
intracellular shock-response system, by contact with cellular toxins, by
contact with it substrates, or by some combination of the above.
Future Directions
MDR induction is an active area of research which has the potential
for practical ecological applications. For example, if MDR is induced
upon contact with environmental substrates, its concentration in an
organism may be correlated with the amount of toxin the animal has
encountered. In this way, MDR levels in organisms of a species such
as M. californianus from different locations might be used as a measure
