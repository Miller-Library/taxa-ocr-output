Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
exposure to 2AAF or 3MC relative to FSW controls by fluorescence
microscopy. A significant difference was seen in the rate following 3
weeks exposure to the carrier, DMSO, relative to the FSW control by
fluorescence microscopy.
Part A: Comparing MDR Activity, Measuring Dye Efflux by Fluorometry
An assay of efflux rate was performed after a 1 week to the various
treatments. Figure 3 shows the relative increases in the fluorescence
of the medium following tissue loading for 1 hour with 5uM rhodamine.
The fluorescence increase in the media is assumed to be a result of
rhodamine efflux by MDR. Data points represent the mean emission
intensity for two samples of tissue from each treatment type.
Emission intensities were similar in all cases.
The data has been fit to log-transformed linear regression, R2-
0.917. The slope of the lines is proportional to the rate of efflux.
Previous studies have shown that the MDR enzyme follows first order
kinetics, thus relative rates of efflux reflect relative protein
concentrations (Schrenk et al., 1994). A comparison of the slopes by
ANCOVA shows no significant difference between any of the treatment
groups, P= 0.924 (Figure 4).
Figure 4 displays the ratio of the experimental groupsâ€™ efflux rates
to the control efflux rates. The slopes of each of the lines from Figure
3 has been divided by the slope of the FSW line to give a ratio of efflux
