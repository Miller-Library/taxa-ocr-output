Figure5. Relaitive rates of rhodamine efflux into medium. Bars represent ratio
of slope of lines from Figure 3 for each treatment relative to slope of
"standard" line, figure 3. Ratios approximate 1 in all cases. Efflux rates are
the same between animals exposed to FSW (standard), DMSO, 10 uM 2AAF.
and 5 uM 3MC for 1 week.
