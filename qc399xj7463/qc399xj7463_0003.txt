Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
with the membrane (where the p-glycoprotein is located) and with the
either an intracellular or extracellular aqueous environment
(Gottesman and Pastan, 1993).
Several researchers have suggested that MDR might be inducible
upon contact with its substrates. Schrenk et al. (1994) found that in
rat hepatocytes, exposure to 10 uM concentrations of the genotoxin 2-
acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) caused induction of the protein (Schrenk et
al., 1994). Similar induction results have been found in human tumor
cell lines upon exposure to 2AAF, as well as another genotoxin 3-
methylcholanthrene (3MC), and various chemotherapeutic drugs
(Thorgeirsson et al., 1991). Furthermore, Kurelec suggested that 3 days
exposure to used diesel oil was sufficient to cause induction in the
mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis (Kurelec, 1995). This study attempted
to further analyze the inducibility of the MDR protein in the marine
mussel, Mytilus californianus.
Whether MDR, like other protective mechanisms, is inducible
remains a much debated topic which is of interest for a number of
reasons. First, general characterization of this protein is desirable,
particularly since it is highly ubiquitous. Second, although it is
presumed to serve a protective role, no research has been able to
definitively characterize this as the proteinâ€™s major function in Mytilus.
Establishing similarities between MDR and other defense mechanisms
would lend credence to this theory. Third, and most relevant to this
