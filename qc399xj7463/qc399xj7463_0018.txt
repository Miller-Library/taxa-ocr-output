of relative environmental pollution levels. MDR concentrations might
be used to assay the effects of acute environmental changes such as
those resulting from a toxic spill or similar catastrophes. Furthermore,
changes in MDR levels over time might be used as a measure of
chronic changes in pollution levels at a given site.
Hence, much more research should be done to study the induction
properties of MDR. This study suggests a number of directions for
future research. First of all, current techniques of analyzing MDR
function should be further explored. Using rhodamine, the issue of
how much of tissue fluorescence change is due to efflux versus passive
diffusion must be elucidated.
Secondly, more work should be done to characterize the effects of
different compounds and different concentrations of those compounds
on MDR expression. For example, a possible experiment would be to
repeat the exposures in this study with a number of different
concentrations of potential inducers, and follow with bioaccumulation
assays to discern precisely how much toxin is actually reaching the
tissues. Multiple-concentrations of the same compound could be
analyzed for their effects, to see if there exists a threshold of toxin
above which the MDR system is induced.
Thirdly, more sensitive methods of quantifying proteins could be
used in order to detect small differences in amount of MDR protein
between organisms from different experimental treatments or
