Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
ecological environments. For example, dot blots or radioactive
substrate binding studies might provide more specific information
about protein content in specific tissues. This would allow for more
accurate comparisons of MDR levels between organisms.
Given the potential for important ecological applications of MDR
induction, more research should be done in this arena. Preliminary
results with the species Mytilus californianus presented here give an
indication of future areas for fruitful research to elucidate the
mechanism of MDR induction in the tissues of marine mussels.
