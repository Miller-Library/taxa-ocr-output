Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
studies in two tumor cell lines with fluorescent coumarin-conjugated
vinblastine to show that efflux of this substrate was almost entirely
due to the action of the MDR protein, rather than to passive diffusion
(Roepe, 1992). Studies using fluorescent rhodamine in mussels would
be useful in order to discover the proportions of efflux rate due to MDR
versus passive diffusion.
Secondly, since rhodamine is a known substrate of MDR, if there
had been induction, a higher efflux rate would be observed in induced
animals compared to those seen in seawater controls. Even if the
controls were showing only the effects of diffusion, induced animals
would be displaying the combinatory effects of increased MDR
expression and baseline diffusion; thus the rate would be increased.
Still, future studies with media fluorescence as a measure of MDR
activity should be conducted in order to address this issue of diffusion
versus efflux.
Further efflux data using a fluorescence microscope confirmed the
above result that no induction occurred as a result of exposure to 3MC
or 2AAF. Tissues exposed to the two genotoxins for three weeks were
viewed under a fluorescence microscope after 45 minutes incubation in
rhodamine dye. The decrease in tissue fluorescence over time
reflected the rate of MDR function, since MDR transports rhodamine
out of the gill tissues. Statistical analysis showed no difference in
efflux rate for the exposed tissues with respect to control tissues.
