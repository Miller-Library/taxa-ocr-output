Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Figure 2 compares MDR levels in animals following 1 week of
exposure to test chemicals. Each sample was from a pooled
homogenate of combined gill tissue from three animals. Since all 170
kDa bands appear very intense, comparisons between treatment groups
are difficult to make, and results from this assay are inconclusive.
Assays for MDR Activity using Rhodamine Efflux Rates
Summary of Findings
As a means of comparing MDR activity, comparisons were made
between the efflux rates of rhodamine dye, a fluorescent substrate of
the MDR protein. The P-glycoprotein has been shown by other
researchers (Schrenk et al. 1994) to follow first order kinetics in its
substrate efflux; hence the efflux rate is independent of substrate
concentration. Therefore, comparisons of the efflux rates can be used
to compare the amount of total protein function in the tissues of
various treatment types.
This study confirmed the first-order kinetics results. Log
transforms of a graph of the fluorescence vs. time approximated a
linear curve in both assays performed (fluorometry assay R2= 0.917;
microscopy assay R2= 0.956) (see figures 4 & 7). No difference was
found in the efflux rates from tissues exposed to one week of toxin
with respect to controls, as measured by the fluorometry assay,
Similarly, no difference was seen in rate following a three week
