Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
model system, if MDR is inducible and is found to be present in
proportion to the amount of substrate in an organism’s environment, it
could presumably be used as a measure of the amount of toxic
pollution in a given marine environment.
Based upon work by other researchers, this study attempted to
induce MDR in the mussel, Mytilus californianus, by exposing organisms
to two presumably potent inducers of the system, 2AAF and 3MC.
Induction was studied using two techniques. (1) In order to quantify
the amount of MDR protein in animals exposed to toxin versus
unexposed animals, Western Blot analysis was performed on isolated
gill tissues from experimental organisms. (2) Comparisons of the
activity of MDR between exposed and unexposed animals was made
using the fluorescent substrate rhodamine. Changes in tissue
fluorescence were used as a measure of p170 function; the rate of
enzyme activity was compared between gill tissues of mussels exposed
to different compounds as a means of comparing MDR levels between
organisms.
