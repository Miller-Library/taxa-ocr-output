rate relative to control (Figure 5). The ratios are virtually 1 in all cases.
No statistically significant difference exists.
Part B: Comparing MDR Efflux Activity Using Fluorescence Microscopy
Following three weeks of exposure to potential inducers, a section
of mussel gill from each of the experimental treatments was incubated
for 45 minutes in luM rhodamine. Following incubation, a single
tissue segment was observed under fluorescence microscopy. At 30
second time points, images were captured and individual filament
fluorescence was determined. Figure 6 are fluorescence micrographs
showing gill tissue fluorescence in mussels exposed for three weeks to
FSW (A,B), DMSO (C,D) , 2-AAF (E,F), and 3MC (G,H) at 1.5 minutes
and at 15 minutes (3MC is at 1min 30 sec, 14 min 30 sec). Figure 7
shows a graph of the decrease in tissue fluorescence over time for each
of the treatment groups. Data points represent mean fluorescence per
pixel averaged over the area of a single gill filament per image.
The data has been fit to a log-transformed linear regression (See
Figure 8); R2= 0.956. The slope of line is proportional to the efflux rate,
and is representative of MDR activity. Comparison by ANCOVA of
efflux rates between the control, 2-AAF, and 3-MC treatments showed
no significant difference, P=0.351. Treatment with the DMSO carrier
control alone did show a statistically significant difference in efflux
rate from the other 3 samples, P=0.000.
