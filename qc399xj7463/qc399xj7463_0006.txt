et al. (1995). Additionally, membrane vesicles were prepared from gill
tissues by the procedure described by Cornwell et al. (1986). Protein
concentration of both tissue homogenates and vesicle samples were
determined by the BCA protein assay (Smith et al., 1985). 40ug of each
sample was loaded onto and separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel
(BioRad Mini-Protean II) by the procedure of Laemlli et al. (1973)
transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry transfer, and incubated with
the C219 monoclonal antibody followed by goat anti-mouse HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed by
chemiluminesence (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England). The
DX5 tumor cell line, which overexpresses the MDR phenotype, was
used as a positive control for p-glycoprotein. The MES-SA (MES) was a
negative control, which lacks MDR.
Assays for MDR Activity using Rhodamine Efflux Rates
Part A: Fluorometry Assay
Sections of gill tissue were prepared on ice by punching circular disks
of tissue from excised mussel gills with the end of a yellow pipeteman
tip. Eight such disks were then placed in a sack made of 300 u Nitex
mesh and incubated at 12Â°C in a 50 ml capacity beaker with 30 mls of 5
UM fluorescent rhodamine for 1 hour. The sack of tissues was then
removed from the dye, swirled for 10 seconds in FSW to remove
