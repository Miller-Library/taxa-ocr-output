Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Introduction
P-glycoprotein, also known as MDR, is a ubiquitous 170 kDa
membrane transport protein which was first discovered in human
tumor cell lines, where it renders cells resistant to many forms of
chemotherapy (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993). Since its discovery in
tumor cells, analogous MDR proteins have been found in a number of
other vertebrate tissues and in the tissues of some marine
invertebrates (Kurelec, 1992). Its role in marine invertebrates is
thought to be as a protective mechanism against environmental toxins.
MDR is unique among protective mechanisms in that it resides in
the cell membrane. Whereas other protective mechanisms â€” such as
the cytochrome p450 system - work intracellularly to detoxify
compounds, MDR acts at the surface of the cell, presumably removing
substances before they can exhibit their toxic effect.
MDR substrates comprise a wide variety of compounds. Cornwall et
al. (1995) have identified a number of these compounds in the mussel
Mytilus californianus. They include various xenobiotics and rhodamine,
a fluorescent dye (Cornwall et al., 1995). While most transport proteins
are very specific in the types of compounds they carry, the MDR protein
is unique in its ability to transport a wide variety of unrelated
compounds. Most MDR substrates appear to have a single
characteristic common - that they are moderately hydrophobic. This
might contribute to their transport by allowing them to associate both
