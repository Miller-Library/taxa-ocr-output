Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
(Cornwall et al., 1995). The relative abundance of MDR can be seen by
comparing the 170 kDa bands on a Western Blot to both the DX5
positive control cell line, a tumor cell line which overexpresses the
MDR phenotype, and eggs of the echiuran worm, Urechis caupo, also
know to contain MDR protein (Toomey and Epel, 1993).
Comparisons of the samples across treatment lines in this study is
inconclusive in the Western Blot. The blot in Figure 2 cannot really be
interpreted to say whether or not there has been induction because
the bands from all samples are so intense. Since M. califomnianus has
such a high concentration of MDR, Western Blotting may not be
sensitive enough to detect small differences in the amount of this
protein. An alternative immunochemical technique which may be a
more sensitive means to asses protein content is dot blotting, in which
varying concentrations of proteins can be used, (See Galgani et al.,
1995).
Analysis of data from two MDR activity assays suggests that no
induction resulted from exposure to 2AAF or 3MC under the present
experimental conditions. Previous work has shown that MDR follows
first-order kinetics in its efflux rate, at least during the early stages of
efflux. Thus the rate is an inherent characteristic of the protein and
does not depend on the concentration of the substrate (Schrenk et al.
1994; Bornmann & Roepe, 1994).
