Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
The information from this study brings into question other research
that suggests induction of p-glycoprotein by 2AAF and 3MC. However,
previous studies have primarily used human tumor cell lines or rat
hepatocytes in order to study induction (Gant et al., 1995; Schrenk et al,
1994). The levels of toxin employed here were selected based upon
what others have used, but they are somewhat arbitrary concentrations
for use in the context of mussels. Suggested further research would
be to analyze the mussel gill tissues in a bioaccumulation assay to
determine how much of the toxins are in fact reaching the gill tissues.
This would allow one to determine if 2AAF and 3MC are, in fact,
inducers of the p-glycoprotein, or if they were simply not present in a
high enough concentration in order to have an effect.
While these two chemicals, 2AAF and 3MC, did not appear to cause
induction of MDR, one assay did suggest that DMSO may have had an
inducing effect after three weeks of exposure (figures 8&9). This issue
warrants further study, particularly since only one of two MDR activity
assays gave this result.
DMSO was initially used as a carrier control because it was used
to dissolve the genotoxins. The data to date regarding DMSO as an
inducer are controversial. While DMSO has been shown not to be a
substrate of the p-glycoprotein (Dorr and Liddil, 1991), one study using
human tumor cells did suggest that DMSO does induce MDR (Mickely
et al., 1989). In general, inducible protective mechanisms are induced
