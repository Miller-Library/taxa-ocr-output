Figure 8. Fluorescence of gill tissue after 45 minute incubation in 1 1uM
rhodamine. Data points represent average fluoresence per pixel from a single gill
filament. Slopes of the regression lines represent efflux rates. No statistically
significant difference exists between standard (squares, solid line), 2-AAF treated
(grey circles, dashed line) or 3-MC treated (triangles, dotted line); ANCOVA
p=0.351. ANCÖVA analysis shows a significant difference in slope, p=0.000,
between DMSÖ (x's, grey line) and the other three treatments.
