extracellular rhodamine, and then placed in a second 50 ml capacity
beaker with 30 mls FSW. A stir bar was added to ensure even mixing of
effluxed dye with medium. 200ul aliquots of the medium were removed
at 30 second intervals. The aliquots were analyzed on a fluorometer at
an excitation wavelength of 555 nm for emission intensity at 579 nm.
Part B: Tissue Imaging Assay
Small sections of tissue were cut with scissors from the dorsal end of
the ascending arms of a single lamella of the mussel gill (Cornwall et
al., 1995). Tissue sections were incubated at 12Â°C in 5 mls of luM
rhodamine for 45 minutes. A single piece of tissue was then rinsed for
15 seconds in FSW to remove extracellular dye, and then viewed under
a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter.
A single section of the tissue was visualized using a digital image
processor. Images were captured at 30 second intervals. Individual
filaments were analyzed for their fluorescence intensity using the
Image-1 (Universal Imaging Systems) computer analysis program.
Statistics
Linear regressions of the graphs of Fluorescence vs. Time were
performed for data from both activity assays. The slopes of these lines
were taken to be proportional to the rate of efflux over time. Slopes
from the different treatments were tested for equality by Analysis of
