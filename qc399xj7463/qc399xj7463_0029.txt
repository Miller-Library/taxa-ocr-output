Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in Mytilus californianus

Relative Rates of Efflux based upon
Change in Tissue Fluoresence over Time
following 3 Weeks Exposure to Potential Inducers
Standard

2-AAF
Figure 9. Bars represent ratio of slope of lines from Figure 6 for each treatment
realitve to slope of "standard" line, figure 6. Ratios approximate 1 for 2AAF and
3MC treatments. The ratio of DMSO efflux rate to standard is significantly
greater than 1. Rhodamine efflux rates are the same for animals exposed to
FSW (standard), 10 mM 2AAF, and 5 mM 3MC for 3 weeks. A single animal
exposed to DMSÃ– for 3 weeks shows a significantly increased rhodamine efflux
rate.
