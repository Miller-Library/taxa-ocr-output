Shaevitz, Induction of the MDR Protein in M. californianus
Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 2° antibody was
obtained from Pierce.
Animals
Adult mussels of the species Mytilus californianus were collected from
the wave-exposed intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove, California. Mussels were stored for one day in circulating sea
water before incubation in any of the test inducing agents. Specimens
ranged in size from approximately 4 cm to 7 cm.
Experimental Incubation
Animals were incubated at 12-14°C in 350 mls of filtered sea water
(FSW), supplemented with (1) nothing, (2) O.1% DMSO, (3) 10 uM 2AAF
in O.1% DMSO, or (4) 5 uM 3MC in 0.1% DMSO, for 1 to 3 weeks. Air
stones provided the animals with a continuous flow of air. The water
was changed every third day to provide nutrients to the filter-feeding
animals.
Westem Blot Analysis
In order to confirm the presence of the MDR protein and to compare
levels of protein between animals in different experimental treatments,
gill tissue samples were prepared as previously described by Cornwall
