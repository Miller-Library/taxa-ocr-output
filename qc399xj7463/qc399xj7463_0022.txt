Figure 1. Westem Blot labeled with C219 monoclonal antibody to
mammalian p-glycoprotein. Lanes contain left to right (1) molecular weight
markers; (2) MES negative control cell line; (3) DX5 positive control cell
line; (4) isolated membrane vesicles from mussel gill tissues; (5,6) mussel
gill tissue homogenates. The band at 170 kDa is p-glycoprotein. Gill
tissues contain a significant concentration of p-glycoprotein; membrane
vesicles are highly enriched in the protein.

Figure 2. Western Blot of Mytilus californianus gill tissue homogenates
labeled with C219 monoclonal antibody to mammalian p-glycoprotein.
Samples are, left to right, (1) molecular weight markers; (2) DX5 posstive
control cell line; (3,4) FSW control mussel gill; (5,6) DMSO control mussel
gill; (7,8) 2AAF-exposed mussel gill; (9,10) 3MC-exposed mussel gill. All
samples show an intense band at 170 kDa, as well as significant cross¬
reaction products.
