Attachment of Chitons
Chitons could clearly attach to porous glass, wire
screen, and Plexiglas with 3 mm holes. This result also
argutes against suction as a major factor involved in
the resistance of chitons to removal. A chiton on the
3 mm thick Plexiglas with 3 mm holes passed part of its
foot through a hole and expanded it on the opposite side.
providing a mechanical wedging which held the chiton to
the surface. Similarly, portions of the chiton's foot
penetrated the wire screen and expanded on the opposite
side.
When chitons were detached from smooth surfaces, a
relatively insoluble mucus-like residue (hereafter "mucus")
the shape of the chiton's foot remained on the surface.
The chiton's resistance to removal from such smooth
surfaces may be largely due to the adhesive effect of the
mucus they secrete.
It appears that on rough surfaces, the bonding of
chitons to the surface is partially adhesive, due to
mucus, and partially mechanical as the foot conforms
well to surface irregularities. Furthermore, the foot
appears to be the sole organ of attachment.
