Attachment of Chitons
to removal by a force parallel to the surface. Aproximately
three grams were added to the container every two seconds
until the animal broke free of the surface. The device
had a mechanical advantage of two so that the force
required to remove the chiton was taken as twice the
weight of the container.
To determine resistance to removal by a force
perpendicular to the surface, a cloth-backed picture
hanger was glued to the dried plates of an animal
(using the contact glue "ZIP GRIP" 10, Devcon Co.,
Danvers, Mass.), and connected by a string to the device
illustrated in Figure 2. Weights were added at the rate
of three grams every two seconds.
Following each test, the area of the foot and the
total area of the ventral surface were determined by
placing the chiton on a transparent grid. Resistance to
removal is expressd as grams per square centimeter of
foot area, since the foot proved to be the primary site
of attachment.
The relation between roughness of the surface to
which the chiton was attached and resistance to removal
was also determined. Tests were conducted using chitons
attached to smooth glass or Plexiglas, #120 waterproof
emery cloth having an average grit size of 120 u and flat
natural granite.
