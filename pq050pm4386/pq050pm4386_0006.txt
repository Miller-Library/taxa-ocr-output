Attachment of Chitons
related to the degree of exposure to wave action in the
habitat of each species.
2. The rougher the surface to which a chiton was attached,
the greater the force required to remove the specimens
from the surface.
3. The foot plays the major role in attachment by secreting
an adhesive mucus material and by mechanically conforming
to surface irregularities with its tissue.
4. Suction does not appear to play a major role in the
attachment of species tested.
