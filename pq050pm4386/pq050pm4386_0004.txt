Attachment of Chitons
Linsenmeyer
Nuttallina, occupies a surf-exposed habitat, had a
comparatively high mean resistance to removal of 146
g/cm. Thus, the resisting force had a direct adaptive
relationship to the habitat occupied by each of the species.
It was observed in all species that the plates and
mantle were forcefully displaced as the loading increased,
while the foot remained fixed. This strongly implies that
the foot plays the major role in attachment.
The lateral forces required to remove Mopalia muscosa
from the three types of surfaces are shown in Figure 4.
Mopalia muscosa had a mean resistance of 112 g/cm
when settled on Plexiglas, 144 g/cm when on #120 emery
cloth and 223 g/cm when on granite. The animals had a
mean resistance to a vertical (lifting) force of 82 g/cm
on natural rock. Thus substrate roughness had a significant
effect on the resistance to detachment by forces both
lateral to and normal to the attachment surface. During
the tests using forces normal to the surface, the plates
and mantle lifted off the surface by as much as 5 mm withÂ¬
out detachment of the foot, again implicating the foot
as the organ of attachment.
No significant differences were detected in the
resistance of Mopalia muscosa to lifting forces applied
at atmospheric pressure and under veuums of 127 and 380
mm of mercury below atmospheric pressure (Figure 5).
