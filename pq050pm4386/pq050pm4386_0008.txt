Attachment of Chitons
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1
Device used to determine resistance to removal by a force
parallel to the attachment surface.
Figure 2
Device used to determine resistance to removal by a force
perpendicular to the attachment surface.
Figure 3
A comparison of the lateral force required to detach the
five species of Polyplacophora in relation to the degree
of wave action to which they are normally exposed. Bar
graphs show mean and standard deviation.
Figure 4
The lateral force required to detach Mopalia muscosa from
various substrata.
Bar graphs show mean and standard
deviation.
Figure 5
The vertical lifting force required to detach Mopalia muscosa
from a Plexiglas plate at atmospheric pressure and at vacuums
of 127 and 380 mm of mercury below atmospheric pressure.
Bar graphs depict mean and standard deviation.
