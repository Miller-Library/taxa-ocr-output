Attachment of Chitons
INTRODUCTION
According to Arey and Crozier (1919), the mechanism
by which Polyplacophora attach themselves to surfaces is
suction, primarily from the mantle. Hoffman (1931)
comments that the role of the ventral mantle and the foot
are of equal importance in fastening to surfaces. Detailed
research on this subject, however, is lacking.
This investigation was designed to determine the
forces required to remove several species of Polyplacophora
from various surfaces, and to elucidate the mechanism by
which they resist removal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mopalia lignosa (Gould, 1846), Mopalia muscosa (Gould,
1846), Nuttalina californica (Reeve, 1847), Katharina
tunicata (Wood, 1815), and Stenoplax heathiana (Berry,
1946) were collected intertidally off the Monterey
Peninsula in California in April and May, 1974. After
collection, undamaged chitons were held in running sea
water aquaria until tested. Chitons were used within
four days of collection and each animal was used in only
one trial.
Prior to testing, chitons were allowed to attach to
the test surface for a period of two hours. The device
sketched in Figure 1 was used to determine the resistance
