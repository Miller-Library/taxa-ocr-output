Attachment of Chitons
pressure (suction) under the foot as a method of attachment,
individual Mopalia muscosa, attached to Plexiglas plates,
were placed in a vacuum desiccating jar. Piano wire,
attached to the glued hook on the animal, exeited the
jar through a small hole and was connected to the device
illustrated in Figure 2. Tests were run at atmospheric
pressure and under vacuums of 127 and 380 mm of mercury
below atmospheric pressure.
Additionally, chitons were allowed to settle on
substrates with varying pore size: fritted glass with a
pore diameter of less than 15 u, a 1 mm mesh wire
screen, and Plexiglas containing numerous 3 m diameter
holes. Their ability to cling, after two hours was tested.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 3 shows the resistance of chitons to removal
by forces parallel to a Plexiglas surface, in g/cm of
foot surface, for each species. Nuttallina, which
inhabits rocks subject to heavy surf, exhibited a mean
resistance to removal of 237 g/cm. This was more than
double the resisting force of the three species occupying
the most protected habitats: the two under-rock species,
Stenoplax heathiana and Mopalia lignosa, had mean values
of 64 and 94 g/cm respectively, and Mopalia muscosa,
found on the top surface of protected roacks, had a mean
value of 112 g/cm. Katharina tunicata, which, like
