SUMMAR
Diurnal rhythms in ammonia release were studied in the
following eight species of isopods found in Monterey, Cali¬
fornia: Porcellio scaber (Latreille, 1804), Alloniscus per¬
convexus (Dana, 1854), Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804)
Idothea montereye
is (Maloney, 1933), Idothea kirchanskii
(Lee, 1967), Idothea resecata (Stimpson, 1857), Cirolana
arfordi (Lockington, 1877), and Lironeca vulgaris (Stimpson,
1857). All species studied except C. harfordi showed con¬
spicuous peaks of release between noon and 4:00 p.m., and
ninima at various times during the night. The experiments,
carried out on fed male specimens in constant light are be¬
lieved to represent a general pattern in isopods.
Additional experiments revealed that ammonia release
is not correlated with fecal release in I. resecata, and
that sites of release on P. scaber seem to be located on
the ventral surfaces of the head and telson.
The relationship between ammonia release and locomotory
pattern is discussed.
