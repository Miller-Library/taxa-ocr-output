fact of their marine environment. However, the three species
of Idothea were found to have ammonia excretion patterns
closely resembling those of the Oniscoidaea (Figs. 4, 5, 6).
In each case, the maxima were located from noon to 4:00 p.m.,
with minima occurring either between midnight and 4:00 a.m.
or 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. In Idothea resecata (Fig. 6), the
amplitude of the fluctuation was decreased and no significant
difference between the peaks at 8:00 a.m. to noon and noon
to 4:00 p.m. was observed. However, the patterns of these
marine species are very similar.
The two Flabellifera observed are exceptional both in
activity and in excretory pattern. C
trolana harfordi and
ironeca vulgaris are primarily carnivorous, and Lironeca
which is a parisite on flatfish seems to be exclusively
carnivorous. Sloan (1967) has shown a relationship between
protein intake and ammonia release in isopods, and it was
considered desirable to see if high protein intake might
also affect release patterns. The pattern observed for fed
male Cirolana in constant light was obtained from Harbaugh
(1973) who was working on patterns of ammonia release in
Cirolana in the same lab that all other species were tested.
The pattern observed in Cirolana (Fig. 7) is less distinct
than that of the Idothea, but does reveal some interesting
features. First the typical maximum from noon to 4:00 p.m.
is if anything, a period of minimal release, and the maximal
period observed seems to occur between 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.
This apparent reversal of the patterns previously observed in
