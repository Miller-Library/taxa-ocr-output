compared against a standard of ammonium sulfate, in a Klett¬
Somerson Photoelectric Colorimeter using a red filter.
Ammonia release was studied in terms of sites of re¬
lease by wrapping isopods in damp filter paper impregnated
with phenol red. The paper was impregnated by soaking in
1/5 dilution of standard indicator solution, 0.l g in 14.3 ml
0.02 M NaoH and allowed to partially dry. At 30 min. inter¬
vals, the animal was carefully unwrapped and the paper ex¬
amined.

I. Rhythmicity in terrestrial species.
In experiments conducted in the month of May, the
release of gaseous ammonia was monitored through 24 hour
periods in three terrestrial species of isopods, Porcellio
scaber, Alloniscus perconvexus, and Armadillium vulgare with
the result that all species showed a significant and similar
rhythmicity. Fed males consistently released significantly
greater amounts of ammonia during the afternoon from noon
to 4:00 p.m. with release becoming more erratic and signifi¬
cantly diminished during the night. It was found that there
is no linear relationship between body weight and amount of
release, so each animal was recorded in percent of his own
mean hourly release, and compared on this basis, at each
reading with other animals.
In Porcellio scaber (Fig. 1) the results are very
similar to those reported by Hartenstein, Wieser, and
Schweizer (1969) for the same species and time of year in
