recording general areas of release, though resolution is not
great. The finding that both the head and telson seem in¬
volved in ammonia release poses questions. Is the observed
release an artifact of the experimental method, or a response
to stress or fright, resulting in release from the integumental
glands as noted by Gorham (1973)? All animals survived the
experiment apparently unharmed, and the position of an animal
wrapped in moist filter paper is not unlike that of a burrowed
animal. If the release is not an artifact, then the possi¬
bility of multiple sites must be considered. It has been
noted that some crustaceans excrete by means of an antennal
gland located on the head (Hartenstein, 1970), and isopods
have this gland present. It is also possible that the diges¬
tive tract, which opens at both apparent sites of release
may be used as the excretory organ. To investigate this
possibility, I. resecata was chosen and investigated to see
if the gut might produce simultaneous bursts of feces and
ammonia. No correlation could be found.
The observation that ammonia excretion occurs in fairly
discrete bursts rather than as a continuous process suggests
that there might be a build up, either of ammonia or à pre¬
cursor, prior to release. A search for this precursor in
animals prior to the times of maximum release may shed further
light on the pathway and mechanism of ammonia excretion in
these animals.
