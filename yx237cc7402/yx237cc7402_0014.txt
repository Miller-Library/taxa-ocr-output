Figure 1. The diurnal pattern of ammonia release in
fed male Porcellio scaber in constant light. The vertical
xis is percent of mean hourly excretion, and the horizontal
axis is a 24 hour cycle where 1200 = noon; N - 10, and stanÂ¬
dard deviation is indicated.
Figure 2. The diurnal pattern of ammonia release in
fed male Alloniscus perconvexus in constant light. Percent
mean hourly excretion is plotted against a 24 hour cycle
where 12 = noon; N - 8, and S.D. is indicated.
Figure 3. The diurnal pattern of ammonia release in
fed male Armadillidium vulgare in constant light. Percent
mean hourly excretion is plotted against a 24 hour cycle
where 12 = noon; N = 8, and S.D. is indicated.
Figure 4. The diurnal pattern of ammonia release in
fed male Idothea montereyensis in constant light. Percent
mean hourly excretion is plotted against a 24 hour cycle
where 12 = noon; N = 10, and S.D. is indicated.
Figure 5. The diurnal pattern of ammonia release in
fed male Idothea kirchanskii in constant light. Percent
mean hourly excretion is plotted against a 24 hour cycle
where 12 = noon; N = 10, and S. D. is indicated.
Figure 6. The diurnal pattern of ammonia release in
fed male Idothea resecata in constant light. Percent mean
hourly excretion is plotted against a 24 hour cycle where
12 = noon; N = 10, and S.D. is indicated.
