humidity or moisture considerations can account for the
fluctuation, and the afternoon does not seem to be a period
of reduced activity. The Flabellifera studied present even
stronger evidence that factors apart from activity may con¬
trol release. Cirolana harfordi is a distinctly nocturnal
animal (Harrold, 1973) which has its maximum in activity
corresponding with its maximum period of release, or an ap¬
parent direct correlation between activity and excretion.
Lironeca vulgaris, in contrast, is an almost sessile parasite,
which seems incapable of locomotion in its fully matured
male form (Whiteside, 1973). This animal lives most of
its life in the gills of fish and yet shows a very marked
and relatively complex pattern of release, with maxima in
both afternoon and early morning. These observations are
comparative, and while it is realized that a similar pattern
of release could meet the environmental pressures imposed on
in each species, the very similarity of pattern suggests that
there might be a more basic common rhythm in isopods, control¬
ling ammonia excretion.
The mechanism of ammonia release in isopods also re¬
mains unclear. Preliminary investigation in P. scaber indi¬
cated that the telson might play a role in gaseous release
with the anus and respiratory pleopods considered to be
likely sites of release. Accordingly, the relation of the
telson to release was examined. The technique of wrapping
animals in soaked filter paper bearing the non-toxic indi-
cator phenol red was found to be a satisfactory method for
