Whenever possible, freshly collected animals were used
to minimize any trauma from storage in the laboratory. When
storage was necessary, the Oniscoidaea were kept in plastic
bins with dirt or sand and litter from where the animals were
collected. The Valvifera and Flabellifera were stored in
tanks with running seawater, aeration, and a supply of food.
In all experiments, only males were used, and in all cases
arange of animal sizes was included.
The method of monitoring ammonia evolution was different
in the terrestrial and marine species. In terrestrial species,
individuals were placed in 25 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and the
flasks were continually flushed with air. The air was puri¬
fied by filtration through cotton, bubbling through a solu¬
tion of 1 N HoSO) to remove any ammonia, and then humidified
by passage through distilled water. After passing through
the experimental chambers, ammonia was trapped in 10 ml of
distilled water addified to 4.5 by the addition of dilute HCI.
Every four hours 1 ml samples were taken, and the trapping
solutions replaced. In marine species, individuals were
kept in test tubes with 10 ml seawater at ambient seawater
temperature and were aerated hourly with purified air.
Every four hours, the water was sampled and replaced, as
above. In all experiments, the animals were exposed to
constant light in the laboratory.
Ammonia was measured by the phenol/hypochlorite reac¬
tion as described by Solorzano (1969), and readings were
