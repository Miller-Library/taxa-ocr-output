Innsbruck, Austria. All animals produced ammonia during the
afternoon interval, in amounts that represented a maxima for
those animals. In other intervals, some animals released no
ammonia or reduced quantities. There is a significant mini¬
mum between midnight and 4:00 a.m. These experiments were
carried through one 24 hour period, beginning at noon. It
appears unlikely that the observed maximum reflect a period
of adjustment to experimental conditions because experiments
started at 4:00 p.m. presented the same type of pattern.
Both Alloniscus perconvexus and Armadillidium vulgare (Figs.
2 and 3) produced the same pattern observed in Porcellio.
Release during the night was sporadic and at a low level for
individuals, and the same fairly uniform peak of release oc¬
curred from noon to 4:00 p.m.
II. Rhythmicity in marine species.
The marine species chosen for study represent two
families of isopods, the Valvifera and the Flabellifera.
From the former family, Idothea resecata, I. montereyensis,
(ii were selected, and from the latter family,
rchan!
and I. k
irolana harfordi and Lironeca vulgaris were chosen.
The species of Idothea have a habitat which is more
restricted than that of the terrestrial species, in the
sense that they are found living and feeding on specific
algae. While the terrestrial species are scavengers and
exhibit a diurnal oscillation between active scavenging
and retirement to burrows. Therefore, they were considered
to provide a contrast to the terrestrial forms beyond the
