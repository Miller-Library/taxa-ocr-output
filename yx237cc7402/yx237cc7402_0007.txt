the other species is less pronounced because of the more
constant rate of ammonia release throughout a period of
24 hours. Harbaugh (1973) has reported a more distinct
pattern for animals maintained in the dark. The pattern
shown by Lironeca vulgaris (Fig. 8) combines features of
the patterns of Idothea, terrestrial isopods, and C
rolana
in a very striking rhythmicity. The individuals tested
produced most of their ammonia between noon and 4:00 p.m.
with a second substantial peak between midnight and 4:00 a.m.
The other readings were often characterized by a number of
animals producing no ammonia.
III. The nature of ammonia release.
Having observed patterns in release, the emphasis was
shifted to learning more about the nature of the release
itself. For this work, a terrestrial species, Porcellio
scaber and a marine species Idothea resecata were chosen.
These animals both have afternoon maxima, and were found to
be easy to work with. In addition, personal observations
of these animals revealed traits which made these animals
attractive. Specifically, fed specimens of I. resecata
are conspicuous producers of fecal pellets, making it pos¬
sible to test a relationship between fecal and ammonia re¬
lease. Porcellio had been observed to release a sufficient
amount of ammonia to cause a color change in phenol red
indicator paper.
However the basic aim of this set of experiments was
to increase the resolution on periods of significant release
