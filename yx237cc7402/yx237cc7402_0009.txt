was found which, with only one exception, closely approximated
that reported by Wiser in Porcellio scaber and Oniscus assellus
with a large maximum in the afternoon. The general presence
of a pattern or rhythm seems fairly well established, but the
underlying causes for this rhythm is more obscure. Basic to
all theories advanced by Hartenstein to explain rhythmicity,
is the existence of inverse relationship of excretion to lo¬
comotory pattern. Rhythmicity reflects energy releasing
metabolism of amino acids during activity and excretion
during periods of rest in humid burrows where membrane perme¬
ability to ammonia release can best be permitted.
In both Porcellio and Alloniscus, there are established
patterns of activity which conform to nocturnal scavenging
and retreat by day, as documented by Brereton (1957) and
Pratt (1973) respectively. However, in the related terrestrial
-. 7
species Armadillidium, the nocturnal pattern, though common,
may vary from population to population (Paris, 1962) and in
local populations near the laboratory, individuals were ob¬
served to be foraging by day. These Armadillidium still show
a pattern distinguished by pronounced excretion maxima and
minima.
In the marine species, the problems in relating the
release pattern to activity are even greater. The species
of Idothea studied may be found on their characteristic algal
substrata, at any time of the day, with filled intestines,
and with no observable fluctuations in activity level.
However the same rhythm of release was found. Clearly, no
