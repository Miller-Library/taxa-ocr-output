The ammonotelism of isopods has been documented by
Dresel and Moyle (1950) who found that ammonia was the major
nitrogenous end product in all species they studied, with a
few terrestrial species, particularly Armadillium vulgare,
producing significant amounts of uric acid, while urea was
totally absent. Hartenstein, Wieser, and Schweizer (1969)
found that the ammonia release of terrestrial isopods was
r greater than that reported by Dresel and Moyle owing to
a substantial gaseous evolution. Furthermore Hartenstein
et al found that gaseous ammonia release displays a diurnal
rhythmicity with a maximum during the afternoon, and they
concluded that the rhythm was inversely related to the patÂ¬
tern of locomotory activity of the animals. The animals
tested by Hartenstein et al were members of the Oniscoidaea,
and the species tested, Porcellio scaber and Oniscus assellus,
are primarily nocturnal scavengers. The Monterey, California
has a rich isopod fauna. Oniscoidaea, as well as other
amilies which display similar nocturnal locomotory patterns
are represented. The abundance of available species provided
an opportunity for a comparative study of diurnal rhythms in
marine and terrestrial species and reexamination of patterns
previously observed (Hartenstein et al 1969).
