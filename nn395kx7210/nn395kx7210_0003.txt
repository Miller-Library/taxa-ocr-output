Materials and Methods
Specimens:
Specimens of Calliostoma canaliculatum and Ophiopteris papillosa were collected from
Monterey Bay by Sealife Supply (Sand City, CA). Pycnopodia helianthoides was collected from
the Great Tide Pool in Pacific Grove, CA. Aplysia californica were from the National Resource
for Aplysia, University of Miami, FL.. Immediately after arrival all organisms were placed in
separate holding tanks with circulating natural seawater at 12°C.
Yellow Stuff Extraction:
In order to extract the hypobranchial gland, the snail was anaesthesised in a solution of
7.5% MgCl2 in dH2O and natural seawater (mixed in a 1:2 ratio) for 15 minutes. The shell of the
snail was then cracked with a vise, and the snail was pinned down in order to extract its gland.
The average mass of a gland was 0.040g. 0.8ml of natural seawater was then added and the
gland was homogenized. The supernatant was then removed and centrifuged at 12,000 RPM for
15 minutes. This solution of YS had a concentration of 0.05g/ml of NSW. This solution was
fürther diluted by 100 times with seawater for use in the experiments below. All solutions were
kept at 4°C until ready for use.
Seastar response to Yellow Stuff and serotonin:
Individual Ophiopteris papillosa were placed in a plastic container measuring 15cm by
20cm by 1Ocm containing 1800ml of natural seawater. Äfter each assay, the container was
rinsed and the seawater replaced. The seastars acclimated in the box for five minutes before any
tests were carried out A variety of compounds were tested: 1:10 and 1:100 YS, ImM 5-HT,
O.1mM 5-HT, 1mM octopamine, and 1mM 5-hydroxytryptophan.. Using a Pipetman, 5Oul of
the compound, was slowly ejected Icm away from the seastar’s arm. Care was taken to ensure
that the force of the ejected liquid did not cause a reaction from the seastar. Controls were
