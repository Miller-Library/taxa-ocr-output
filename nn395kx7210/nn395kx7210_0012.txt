Acknowledgements
1 wish to thank everyone at Hopkins who has helped me during these last two months,
especially the Fisher’ people (Anna, Ryan, Jane, Rachel) for keeping me company during the
long days of electrophysiology, Mike for all the voltage-clamp work he did for me, the helpful
people in Gilly’s lab, my housemate Tori for her continued support, Brett for all his rides home
at 12am and Charles for making sure I ate dinner at lam..
Gilly - thank you for making sure I thought everything through before jumping in head
first, for being a natural skeptic, for your love of paperclips, and for all the time and invaluable
encouragement you supplied.
Stuart - thank you for your amazing enthusiasm and energy you put into this project, and
for helping me make sense of the complicated world of Aplysia.
