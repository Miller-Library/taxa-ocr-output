various voltages were recorded upon establishment of a successful voltage clamp; after a control
solution change to ND96 in a 1:100 dilution with seawater, and again after the addition of 1:100
YS. To wash out the YS, 3-4 ml of ND96 in 1:100 dilution of seawater was used (to control for
the effects of natural seawater). The solution of YS used was from the same stock of YS used
for the intracellular recordings on the buccal ganglia.
Results
Preliminary behavioural studies showed that Ophiopteris papillosa responded to Yellow
Stuff, although it is not a predator of C. canaliculatum. This class of echinoderms is unique in
its anatomy, in that it has giant axons present in the radial nerve cord which run the length of
each arm and mediate rapid escape responses (Yee et al, 1986). As a result this seastar
demonstrates a very visible and easily classifiable response to noxious chemicals. Responses to
application of various compounds are summarised in fig. 2A. Seawater (the negative control)
induced almost all level 0 responses, thus indicating that the force of ejection of the liquid from
the Pipetman was not large enough to induce a behavioural response from the seastar’s sensitive
arms. Application of both dilutions of Yellow Stuff resulted in a large percentage of level 2 and
a significant number of level 3 responses. A chi-squared test concluded that the differences in
frequency of each of the 4 levels was highly significant (p-value of «0.01). Application of YS at
dilutions over 1:100 did not result in any significant responses (data not shown). Application of
both concentrations of 5-HT also caused a high proportion of level 1 and level 2 reactions (p-
value of £ 0.01). To show that this behavioural effect was not common to all biological peptides
and amines, octopamine another common invertebrate neurotransmitter was applied. Over 60%
of the responses were level 0, similar to application of natural seawater. Application of 5-
