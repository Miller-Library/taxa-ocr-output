hydroxytryptophan (the precursor to 5-hydroxytryptamine), resulted in an even spread of
reactions from level 0 to level 3, and did not show any statistically significant differences
between the frequency of the responses in the 3 levels.
Pisaster giganteus did not respond to either 5-HT or Yellow Stuff in a manner that was
easy to identfy in a reasonable period of time, therefore this species was not used.. As there was
only one Pycnopodia specimen, the results may not be as valid as that of the Ophiopteris, but the
response of this specimen did correspond with previous literature (Bryan et al, 1997). Again, as
can be seen in fig. 2B, natural seawater did not elicit a response in Pycnopodia, while both YS
and 5-HT resulted in a noticeably strong response. The Pycnopodiaâ€™s response to octopamine
was similar to the response seen in Ophiopteris.
Based on these results, it would appear that there is relationship between serotonin and
Yellow Stuff in these seastars as both compounds elicited escape responses that could not be
induced with octopamine or 5-hydroxytryptophan. These behavioural results give further
credence to the idea that 6BrMT may act biologically by interacting with serotonergic pathways
Intracellular recordings from the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica
In order to further investigate any effects Yellow Stuff may have on serotonergic
pathways, a suitable assay based on the buccal ganglia of Aplysia was utilised. The buccal
ganglia (see fig. 3) contains a central pattern generator (CPG) that mediates rhythmic movements
of the buccal apparatus during feeding. The activity in the CPG is modulated by extrinsic
serotonergic inputs from the giant cerebral neurons (Evgeni et al, 2000) making these cells an
appropriate assay for comparison of YS and 5-HT.
In experiments where 1:100 YS was applied to the bath without the presence of 5-HT,
there is a clear trend - the application of YS did not change the baseline activity of the cell (see
