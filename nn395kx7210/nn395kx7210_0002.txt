Introduction
The gastropod Calliostoma canaliculatum which lives in the kelp forest of Monterey Bay
has an interesting and aggressive escape mechanism that distinguishes it from other snails of this
genus. In order to escape from its predators, the seastars Pycnopodia helianthoides and Pisaster
giganteus, C. canaliculatum, it will secrete a yellow mucous (Yellow Stuff or YS), from its
hypobranchial gland, that causes the seastar to retract its tube feet or to physically move away
from the exudate. Previous studies (Bryan et al, 1997) focused on the behavioural response of
the seastars to this exudate, but attempts at purifying and identifying this compound were
unsuccessful. It was only recently that an active component of Yellow Stuff was identified (Sack
et al) to be 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine, a serotonin dimer derivative (fig 1). This compound
affects Shaker potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The most prominent effects of
6BrMT (or raw Yellow Stuff) are a marked slowing of activation kinetics and a reduction of
peak potassium current amplitude. However, there have been no tests of either Yellow Stuff or
6BrMT on any serotonergic system despite the obvious structural similarity of serotonin and
6BTMT.
The goal of this investigation was to demonstrate a relationship between Yellow Stuff
and serotonin using a variety of different lines of experiments, and more specifically to
determine if Yellow Stuff was behaving in an agonistic or an antagonistic manner in relation to
serotonin.
