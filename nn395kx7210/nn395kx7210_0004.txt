carried out by applying 50ul of natural seawater Icm away from the seastar’s arm. Äfter each
assay, the seastar was returned to its tank, and a different seastar used. The same seastar would
not be used more than once a day to avoid desensitization. Together there were 6 Ophiopteris
papillosa, and over a period of two weeks each seastar was used in an average of 12 assays.
Similar trials were performed on the single Pycnopodia helianthoides specimen.
Behavioural responses to application of the test solutions were classified using a scale of
0 to 3, where 0 = no reaction, 1 = arm tip recoil, 2 = whole arm recoil, and 3 = whole arm recoil
accompanied by movement of seastar away from application site. Data were analysed using the
chi-squared test.
Intracellular recordings from Aplysia buccal ganglion
Buccal ganglia from Aplysia californica were excised, and desheathed in order to expose
the B cells. Once excised and desheathed the cells were healthy for up to 36 hours if stored in
natural seawater at 4°C. The ganglia was pinned to a layer of Sylgard at the bottom of a
perfusion chamber. Recordings were performed in this chamber with volume 1.5ml. An input
tube for fresh seawater and output tube operated by a vacuum pump allowed the solution in the
chamber covering the ganglia to be replaced at anytime. Once the ganglia was desheathed, it
was hard to specifically identify particular cells, however it was unnecessary to pinpoint the
exact cells as it was an area of the ganglion that was of specific interest. This area was the
region with the Bl and B2 cells (bottom half of the ganglion) in which many cells are recognised
as having serotonin receptors (Gerschenfeld and Paupardin-Tritsch, 1974). These neurons were
impaled with a single micro-electrode that were filled with 3M KCl. Recordings were done at
room temperature.
Three different protocols were followed.
