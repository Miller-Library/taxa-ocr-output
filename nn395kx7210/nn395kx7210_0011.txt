The lack of effect of 1:100 Yellow Stuff on Shaker potassium channels is consistent with
the argument that YS is behaving antagonistically to serotonin. 6BrMT has a well documented
effect on Shaker potassium channels - a reduction of peak potassium current amplitude and a
reduced activation rate (Sack et al). With 1:100 YS, only one of these effects was visible (fig.
7A), therefore at this dilution YS has a much smaller effect on Shaker potassiuam channel
kinetics. Since 1:100 YS has a pronounced effect on the serotonergic system of the buccal
ganglia it is likely that at this dilution, YS is interacting via serotonergic pathways and not
predominantly on Shaker potassium channels. It is very likely that this antagonistic effect is
primarily due to the presence of 6BrMT, a serotonin analogue.
Conclusions
6BrMT has a well documented effect on Shaker potassium channels, but the fact that a
low concentration of raw Yellow Stuff suppresses serotonin induced activity in the buccal
ganglia of Aplysia, provides a good indication that YS has multiple pathways through which it
functions, one of which being through a serotonin pathway. Although this study primarily
concentrated on the effect of YS on Aplysia, an organism which C. canaliculatum would not
normally encounter in its ecological niche, the conclusion that YS functions antagonistically to
5-HT could help determine the mechanism of how YS elicits the escape response in its predators.
This study also raises many more questions about the relationship of 6BrMT and YS to
serotonin, not only in seastars, but in humans, where a serotonin antagonist has many
pharmacological uses.
