seen when raw exudate was used (Sack, personal communication). However 1:100 dilution of
YS used in the present study only resulted in a decrease in peak current amplitude, and no
significant decrease in activation rate (Fig. 7A). The implications of this will be discussed in
greater detail below.
Discussion
The results from the three different lines of experiments in this study indicate that Yellow
Stuff is behaving via some serotonergic pathway. The behavioural studies provided a base for
the latter electrophysiological experiements, by demonstrating a relationship between YS and
serotonin that was not seen with other biological substances. These behavioural results thus
provided a justification for further comparison of the two substances, and more importantly
determined the threshold concentration beyond which no visible response from the seastars was
observed. This dilution of YS was then used in all subsequent electrophysiology experiments
The voltage clamp experiment demonstrated that at 1:100 dilution, YS was not affecting the
activation kinetics of Shaker potassium channels, and the intracellular recordings from the
Aplysia buccal ganglia clearly demonstrated the effect of YS on serotonergic activity.
In 1974 Gerschenfeld and Paupardin-Tritsch first convincingly demonstrated that 5-HT
functioned in Aplysia californica as a neurotransmitter by showing that of the 13 cells they
studied in the buccal ganglia, nine had an excitatory response and four had an inhibitory response
due to specific serotonin receptors. Using iontophoretic methods of application, they
demonstrated that 5-HT resulted in pronounced EPSPs in buccal ganglia cells. The results
obtained in this present study are therefore in accordance with previous literature, showing
serotonin behaving in an excitatory fashion, either generating pronounced excitatory post-
