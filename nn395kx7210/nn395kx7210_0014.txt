Fig.1.
Fig. 24
Behavioural response of Ophiopteris papillosa to various chemical stimuli. A
total of 6 Ophiopteris were used in, each for 12 assays.
Fig. 2B
Behavioural response of Pycnopodia helianthoides to the same chemical stimuli.
One specimen was used for the study.

Fig. 4B
After application of 1:100YS to the bath. Trace is 5000ms and is representative
of the whole recording.

After application of 50 ul 1mM 5-HT to the bath. Regular action potentials
generated.

Addition of 1:100 YS into the same chamber 3 min later. Action potentials no
longer seen.
