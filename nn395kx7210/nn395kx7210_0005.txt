A baseline recording of the cell was taken for 3 minutes with the ganglia immersed in
fresh seawater. 50ul of 1:100 YS was then added to the bath using a Pipetman, and a
recording was taken immediately after this for 3 minutes.
2. A baseline recording of the cell was taken for 3 minutes. 5O0ul of 1mM 5-HT was then
added to the bath and a recording taken for 3 minutes. 50ul of 1:100 YS was then added
into the same bath without perfusing the previous solution out, and a recording was taken
for another 3 minutes.
3. A baseline recording of the cell was taken, 5Oul of 1mM 5-HT was then added, a
recording taken for 3 minutes, followed by addition of 50ul 1:100 YS and another
recording taken for 3 minutes. The ganglia was then perfused with natural seawater for
several minutes in order to wash away all the compounds previously added. 5Oul of 5-
HT was then added again to the bath, and a third recording was taken of the cell.
In addition, control recordings of 10 minutes were run to ensure that the effect of YS on the cell
was not confounded by the decrease in serotonin induced activity. Because desensitization of the
cells in the ganglia to both YS and 5-HT was a potential problem, only a few recordings could be
used from each freshly desheathed ganglia.
Voltage clamp:
In conjunction with Michael Hughes, voltage clamp was performed on Shaker A6-46 channels
expressed in Xenopus oocytes bathed in ND96. 2 glass microelectrodes with resistances between
0.7 and 2.0 MÂ£2 were inserted just below the surface of the oocyte membrane and a holding
potential of -60mV was established using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp. Ooctyes
were subjected to voltage pulses lasting 25 ms and stepped at 10 mV increments between -50
and 40 mV. 1:100 dilution of YS was added to the bath by perfusion. A family of Ig traces at
