Herit (Braby and Somero, 2006), it should be determined whether the different species show the
same valve movement in situations of increasing temperature. Another area of future research
could be the connection of these two factors with other environmental stressors, such as
emersion. Studies have shown that heart rates will change when mussels are placed in air (Bayne
et al., 1976). The two general responses observed in mussels are either complete valve closure or
periodically gaping valves. While the former results in an anaerobic environment for the mussels
and the latter allows the mussels to continue aerobic metabolism, valve gaping also correlates
with increased threats of desiccation (Byrne et al., 1990; Shick et al., 1988). Thus, this trade-off
between loss of water and metabolic efficiency may evoke different patterns in valve movement
than those observed in this study.
