Fig. 1: Schematic of Hall-effect sensor system.
Fig. 2: Heart rate versus temperature. Data for one individual, with best-fit lines for the
increasing and decreasing segments and equations shown. Hart was calculated by finding the
intersection point for these two lines. BPM = beats min".
Fig. 3: Heart rate and valve position. (a) Average normalized heart rate (BPM) and average
normalized voltage signal plotted against temperature for all mussels in the temperature ramp
treatment. Lower voltage corresponds to more open valves, and higher voltage reflects more
closed valves. Error bars on heart rate curve represent standard errors. (b) Average heart beat and
valve movement for all mussels, with error bars for voltage based on standard errors.
Fig. 4: Valve position relative to Herit. Voltage differences between average pre-Hert and post-
Hgit values. For the control, a value for the theoretical
t" was determined to be the average
Herit found among all mussels in the temperature ramp treatment. Thus, for the comparisons of
the control specimens, averages of voltages before and after the time at which the theoretical
Hert was reached were used. Paired t-tests were used to compare the change in voltage from
before to after Herit. * indicates P0.05.
Fig. 5: Linear dependence of Hall-effect sensor on temperature. This trend could not be predicted
accurately and thus could not be subtracted from the valve voltage readings for the mussels, but
