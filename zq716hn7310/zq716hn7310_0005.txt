that depended on the distance between the magnet and the sensor, which was recorded through
the PowerLabM data acquisition system. Higher voltage readings corresponded to a smaller
distance between the magnet and the sensor, indicating that the mussel's valves were more
closed. The mussels were placed in 14°C water for at least one hour to recover from handling
stress.
Temperature Experiments
In order to test the effects of temperature on heart rate and valve movement in water, I
placed up to four mussels at a time in an insulated container, either by letting them hang from
their glued sensors, which were supported by a metal rack arm, or gluing a small piece of cork
onto one of their valves and clipping this cork onto the arm. An air pump (TetraTec Deep Water
DW 96-2) supplied oxygen into the container. The mussels were subjected to increasing
temperature ramps from 14°C to 34°C over 2.7 hours (approximately 7.4°C per hour), controlled
by a temperature regulator (Lauda Brinkman, RC 6 CS, Westbury, NY, USA). Twenty mussels
underwent this treatment. Four other mussels were used as biological controls and kept at 14°C
for 2.7 hours after heart rate and valve movement measurement preparation. In order to test the
temperature dependence of the voltage reading from the Hall-effect sensors, three sensors with
magnets attached were placed in the water for the duration of the temperature ramp as an
experimental control. Water temperature was recorded continuously throughout all experiments.
Data Analysis
After obtaining the heart rate tracings, I counted the number of heartbeats per minute
once every 5 minutes of the temperature ramp, as described in Braby and Somero (2006). Next, I
found the approximate Hert for each mussel and counted heartbeats for each minute in the 10
minutes before and after the approximate Herit. To find the actual value of Hert for each mussel, I
