galloprovincialis, this study used specimens of Mytilus californianus, the ribbed mussel. The
latter species is the dominant mussel found in the rocky intertidal zone of Central California, so
it is a relevant study species for investigating the physiological ecology of this habitat.
Materials & Methods
Animal Collection and Care
I collected fisty specimens of Mytilus californianus from the intertidal zone of China
Point at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California on April 24, 2007. These
individuals were placed in mesh bags and kept in an outdoor aquarium with a flow-through
system supplying ambient seawater.
Heart Rate & Valve Movement Measurement
The mussels' heart rates were measured by impedance pneumography, following the
methods of Braby and Somero (2006). In each mussel, I used a Dremel MultiPro"M Cordless drill
to drill holes approximately I mm in diameter on either side of the posterior end of the hinge
region, into the pericardial space. Next, fine copper electrodes, with the first millimeter of
insulation scraped off, were inserted into these holes and glued into place with Loctite
SuperGlueM. Once the glue had set (approximately 15 minutes), the electrodes were connected
to an impedance converter (UFI, Impedance Converter Model 2991). From this point, the voltage
reading was recorded through a data acquisition device (AD Instruments PowerLab/ 16SP).
After completing the heart rate measurement set up, I glued a small magnet onto one
valve of the mussel, on the posterior end opposite from the hinge, using Loctite SuperGlueTM. A
linear Hall-effect sensor (Allegro Microsystems, Inc.) that was covered in heat shrink wrap was
glued onto the other valve across from the magnet (Fig. 1). This sensor gave a voltage reading
