Abstract
When a mussel is subjected to rapidly increasing temperatures, its heart rate will sharply
decrease above a critical temperature (Hert). Previous studies have suggested that this sudden
drop in heart rate may be triggered by a behavioral adaptation to environmental stress, valve
closure. This behavior would lower the amount of oxygen available for aerobic metabolism,
which could necessitate a decrease in cardiac activity. My study examined the temporal patterns
of heart rate and relative valve position (open versus closed) in specimens of ribbed mussel
(Mytilus californianus) exposed to controlled heating in water. Heart rate data and valve motion
were gathered using, respectively, impedance electrodes inserted into the pericardial space and
Hall-effect sensors attached to the mussel valves. The mussels were monitored over the course of
a 2.7 hour period, during which water temperature was increased from 14° C to 34° C. On
average, valves were more closed after Hart than before (P + 0.0001). However, valve closure
began prior to Hart, and the mussels reached their most closed position after Herit had been
surpassed. Thus there was no evidence that complete valve closure occurred before heart rate
decline. Therefore, the fall in heart rate above Hert cannot be ascribed to a simple behavioral
response, complete value closure. Future studies should quantify the responses of valve
movement to other factors, such as decreasing water salinity and emersion effects, that are also
linked to changes in mussel heart rates to gain further insight into the relationship between valve
movement and heart function.
