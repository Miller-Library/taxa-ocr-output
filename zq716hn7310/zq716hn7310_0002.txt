Introduction
When studying the effects of various environmental stressors on organisms, one level of
analysis focuses on relatively short time frame experiments to reveal how quickly different
factors within the organism respond to changes in the environment (Bayne, 1976). This type of
analysis is especially applicable to life in the intertidal zone, where changes in various abiotic
factors take place on a rapid temporal scale. The dynamic conditions of this climate play a key
role in determining the distribution of many species, such that a species' potential habitat is often
constrained by its physiological limits (Hochachka and Somero, 2002). In studying the effects of
environmental stressors on intertidal organisms, it is helpful to look at specific physiological or
behavioral factors that are directly affected by the stressors and that may be important in
determining the distribution of a species.
One group of intertidal organisms that has been studied extensively in relation to such
physical factors as temperature, salinity, and exposure to air are marine mussels. An aspect of
mussel behavior that has often been observed in response to environmental stressors is valve
movement. A mussel's valve movements allow it to regulate access to food and oxygen through
filtering water, and studies have shown that mussels mainly remain open when under water, in
order to sustain their respiration and feeding rates (Curtis et al., 2000). Mussels will often close
their valves when subjected to conditions of environmental stress (Manley and Davenport, 1979).
This behavioral mechanism has been used increasingly in monitoring systems to detect pollution
in the environment, because the mussels will respond quickly to sudden changes in their habitat
(Kramer et al., 1989; Gudimov, 2003).
In research on mussels and the effect of environmental stressors, one of the most
commonly studied physiological factors is heart rate. This physiological factor is relatively stable
