took best-fit lines of the heart rates before and after the heart rate decline began, and I found their
intersection point (Fig. 2). Since the starting heart rates varied considerably among individuals, I
normalized the heart rates so that I could pool the data.
The valve data produced a voltage reading every second. In order to compare the relative
position of the valves among mussels, I normalized all the valve voltage data, as for the heart
rates. Iaveraged the valve voltage reading from before Hait and after Harit and conducted a
paired t-test (q-0.05) between these values for all mussels. I also did the same test on the control
specimens, using the average time of at which Herit occurred from the temperature ramp mussels
to divide the control set data into before and after "Herit":
Results
Out of 20 mussels used in the water heat ramp experiments, only 12 had heart rates that
could be easily read. These mussels exhibited Hert values that ranged from 22.9°C to 29.1°C. On
average, the mussels remained relatively open through the first half of the heat ramp, after which
they began to close (Fig. 3a). This closure continued while the heart rates were rapidly dropping.
Upon inspection of valve traces for individual mussels, it was apparent that some mussels follow
this behavior more than others. In almost half of the mussels, the general patterns seen at the
beginning of the temperature ramp were not as easily distinguishable, though in most mussels the
closure that occurred sometime after Hart was readily observable. This individual variability was
quantified in the larger values of standard error before the valves began to close than after (Fig.
3b).
The average pre-Hert valve voltage reading was significantly lower than the average post-
Hert valve voltage reading (P +0.0001) (Fig. 4). This result indicates that the valves were more
