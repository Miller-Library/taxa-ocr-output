open before Hert than after Hert. In contrast, the control specimens showed no significant
difference between the voltages before and after the time at which average Herit occurred in the
experimental group (P = O.48).
The experimental control data showed a trend for the voltage reading from the linear
Hall-effect sensors to decrease slightly with increasing temperatures (Fig. 5). It was not possible
to determine the magnitude of the effect on each sensor, however, because this value was not
simply dependent on starting voltage. When compared to the amount of movement in the
mussels' valves over the same period of time, however, the effects of the voltage's dependence
on temperature were minimal (less than 10% of the total movement) and would not have
accounted for the magnitude of voltage change observed.
Discussion
The results of this study suggest that the heart rate decline observed in mussels at high
temperatures is not simply caused by a behavioral mechanism, valve closure. As seen in the
comparison of valve position before and after the critical temperatures, the valves were
significantly more closed after Hert than before, indicating that the valves do not reach their most
stable closed point until after Hert has occurred. During the first part of the temperature ramp,
high variation in behavior among the individual mussels correlated with observations of other
researchers that have noted the distinct differences in valve movement among individual mussels
(Loosanoff, 1942; Curtis et al., 2000). In contrast, the lower variation observed when the
mussels' valves began to close and when they reached their most closed position implies that this
valve closure is a programmed response to the stressful conditions of high temperatures.
