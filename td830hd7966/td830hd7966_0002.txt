Introduction
Disturbances are important factors in determining community structure in the rocky
intertidal. The spatial extent, frequency, intensity and season of a disturbance are important
factors determining its effect on the rocky intertidal community (Sousa 1985). As human
populations rise, anthropogenic disturbances in the intertidal will most likely increase in extent,
frequency and intensity. Coastal development may influence intertidal communities with
discharged sewage, industrial effluents and polluted run-off (Murray et al. 1999). Visitors to the
rocky intertidal can also extensively affect intertidal populations by overturning rocks for
scrutiny, collecting organisms for food or bait and trampling on plants and animals (Beauchamp
and Gowing 1982; Povey and Keough 1991; Brosnan and Crumrine 1994; Fletcher and Frid
1996; Murray 1997; Murray and Gibson 1997; Keough and Quinn 1998; Schiel and Taylor 1999;
Brown and Taylor 1999)
Collecting may result in reduced populations of the exploited species (Griffiths and
Branch 1997). Humanâ€™s preferential selection for larger organisms can inhibit the population's
reproductive success (Branch 1975; Wells 1997). Trampling can disturb intertidal communities
by crushing or dislodging plants and animals (Beauchamp and Gowing 1982; Povey and Keough
1991; Murray and Gibson 1997; Schiel and Taylor 1999; Brown and Taylor 1999). This
reduction or removal of organisms may also indirectly affect the intertidal community via
changes in competition, predation and habitat provision interactions (Brosnan and Crumrine,
1994).
