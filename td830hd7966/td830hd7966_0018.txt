Turf and encrusting algae tend to be less susceptible to trampling because of their
morphology. Turf species' thalli are usually short and repeatedly branched. They also spread
vegetatively and are attached to the rock at many points, making them more resistant to
trampling (Beauchamp and Gowing 1982). In trampled areas in North America there has been a
shift in the algal community from larger species to turf-like forms (Beauchamp and Gowing
1982; Brosnan and Crumrine 1994). Our data also show this trend with the turf species (E.
muricata, M. affinis and M. papillatus) present at all four Sites, but the larger, more susceptible
species (P. compressa and F. gardneri) nearly absent in the high-use Sites. M. affinis and M.
papillatus populations are not significantly different between the high-use and low-use Sites,
suggesting that trampling is not intense enough to alter their species composition at the high-use
Sites.
Reduced species diversity can be a result of stress in the rocky intertidal (Beauchamp and
Gowing 1982). In our study, the low-use Sites have considerably higher algal diversity than the
high-use Sites. Lot 2 is particularly homogeneous, primarily filled with bare space, E. muricata,
M. affinis and M. papillatus.
Our data are consistent with what we would predict from the effects of trampling, but
they are not conclusive. Although our non-susceptible species, the limpets, show no significant
difference between the high-use and low-use Sites, suggesting that there is little natural variation
among the Sites, this is probably not the case. Many of the differences between the high and low
use sites cannot be attributed solely to human disturbance because of many potentially
confounding factors.
The large rock promontories located at the high traffic sites, Lot 2 and Point Beach, are
very popular for climbing and sitting. But they are more significant than merely drawing visitors
