Frequency of Various Modes of Transportation Total counts of cars, buses, and bikes produced
a ratio of 157:5:1, which indicated that a majority of the visitors drove to Point Pinos (Table 1).
Ranger Sitings Of the 233 total samples we took, we saw rangers approximately 2% of the time
(usually just driving by on the main road) (Table in Appendix).
Meteorological Data No tabulations were performed to determine intensity of use relative to
temperature, swell size, wind speed, and sky conditions. The recorded temperature, swell size,
and wind speed were taken from measurements taken 30 miles away and, therefore, did not serve
as accurate descriptors for the conditions at Point Pinos. We decided that tabulating counts of
people by weather conditions would not reveal any novel pattern of activity which was not
already known (i.e. more people were there on warm sunny days than cold overcast windy ones).
Sampling Results
After quantifying the frequencies of the various activities, we found that collecting and
fishing comprised an extremely low percentage (22%) of the total number of activities recorded.
We felt that these activities occur too rarely to have a measurable impact on the sessile flora and
fauna. People walking across the rocks on the high and mid-intertidal zones far outnumbered
those collecting or fishing. Hence, we decided that trampling posed the greatest potential threat
to rocky intertidal communities.
Potential trampling was most concentrated at Lot 2 and Point Beach, whereas Lot 1 and
Vertical received very little foot traffic. However, Lot 1 and Vertical could not be used as Sites
