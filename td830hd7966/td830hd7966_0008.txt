ratios before analysis. All tests were conducted at the 0.05 level. Following the initial ANOVA,
planned comparisons were carried out between the averages of the high-use and low-use Sites.
Results
Human Activity
Observations over fifty days produced the following temporal and spatial patterns of
visitation, frequency of activities, mode of transportation, and presence of range
Temporal Patterns
Time of Day Visits to Point Pinos were not distributed uniformly throughout daylight hours.
Highest counts in the Parking Lots and along the Shore (pooled over all days and Sites) occurred
after midday (1 lam - 9pm, Fig. 2B). Counts during morning hours (6-1 lam) were consistently
low. Activity in the intertidal zone itself peaked at midday (Fig. 2A).
Tide Height Visitation varied according to the state of the tide (Fig. 3). A majority of the
visitors came when the tide was below +4ft above MLLW.
Day of the Week Average intensity of use at Point Pinos increased toward the end of the week
and was greatest during the weekends (Fig. 4). The average intensity for weekends was more
than twice that of weekdays. Some weekdays had a distinctly higher average intensity than the
