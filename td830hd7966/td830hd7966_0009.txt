other weekdays due to tour buses or large school groups. The highest recorded intensity of use
occurred during Memorial Day Weekend, the last weekend sampled.
Monthly Patterns Total intensity of use increased toward the end of the spring months (Fig. 5),
with a high degree of day-to-day variation. No clear monthly pattern for intertidal intensity was
evident, except for a noticeably higher level during Memorial Day weekend.
Spatial Patterns
Between Sites Intensity of use varied greatly among the 9 contiguous Sites along Point Pinos
(Table in Appendix). Banana, Point Beach, Vertical, and Corner received the greatest total
intensity of use (i.e. summed over all Zones), whereas Great Tidepool and Lot 1 experienced the
least.
Between Sites and Zones Visitors to the Intertidal zone comprised a small fraction (18%) of the
total visitors to Point Pinos; the remaining 82% were on the Shore (above the intertidal zone) or
in the Parking Lot (Table in Appendix, Fig. 6). In all but two Sites, the intensity of use across the
different zones (ranked from highest to lowest) were Parking Lot, Shore, and Intertidal. Banana,
Point Beach, Vertical, and Corner ranked the highest in parking lot usage. Lot 2, Point Beach,
and Beach 2 were the top three Sites for shore usage. Lot 2 and Point Beach had the greatest
intertidal intensity of use, whereas Lot 1 and Vertical had the least (Fig. 7).
Between Sites and Intertidal Zones Of the visitors who entered the intertidal zone, most
remained in the high (Â° 4ft above 0 MLLW) and mid intertidal (0-4ft above O MLLW) (Fig. 8).
