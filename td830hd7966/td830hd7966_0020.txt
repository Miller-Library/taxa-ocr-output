substrate beneath the boulder fields also varied from sandy to large rock benches between Sites,
as well as within Sites.
These factors all differ considerably among the Sites and contribute to the differences
found in species' distribution and abundance between the high-use and low-use Sites. Therefore
we cannot attribute the differences found between the high-use and low-use Sites to trampling
alone.
Even if trampling is not the only cause of the differences between the high-use and low-
use Sites, it may be having a considerable effect. Our study only provides a snap-shot survey of
Point Pinos in the spring. The study's limited spatial and temporal scales make it difficult to fully
understand the intertidal community composition. Consequently, there needs to be prolonged
studies in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of human activity on the rocky
intertidal at Point Pinos. Trampling manipulations on local algae species, such as M. affinis, M.
papillatus and E. muricata, would provide valuable information, demonstrating their
susceptibility to human foot traffic and the sustainable level of foot traffic that each species can
tolerate. We also recommend fencing off areas within each site to observe if percent cover
increases without any trampling. These fenced off areas would also serve as a control, helping
identify natural disturbances.
The next step is a long-term analysis of human activity at Point Pinos coupled with
periodic sampling in order to detect seasonal variation in human activity as well as in intertidal
community composition. This will establish the timing of the disturbance, an important factor
when considering species recruitment and colonization. The sampling should include both
susceptible and non-susceptible species so that differences between populations can be attributed
to trampling and not some other disturbance. Ideally, a long-term study should employ control
