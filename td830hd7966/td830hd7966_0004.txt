The study region was subdivided into nine contiguous Sites to determine patterns of
human activity relative to public access (parking lots)(Fig. 1). Boundaries between Sites were
also drawn according the observable viewing area. Each Site differed in length along the
shoreline and total surface area. The Sites were designated as follows (from east to west around
the Point): Lot 1, Lot 2, Golf Course, Banana, Point Beach, Vertical, Corner, Beach 2, and Great
Tidepool.
Each Site was subdivided into three Zones: Parking Lot, Shore and Intertidal. The
Parking Lot was defined as the area designated for vehicles (i.e. cars, buses, bikes, RV's) and the
foot-trails between lots. The Shore zone encompassed the area that always remains above highest
high tide, which was usually a sandy beach or rocky bluff. The Intertidal zone was divided
further into High (24ft above Mean Lower Low Water), Mid (0-4ft above MLLW), and Low
(SOft above MLLW) Intertidal. Boundaries of the three intertidal zones at each Site were
determined using a laser surveyor's transit relative to benchmarks of the known height.
Documentation of Human Visitation
Human activity was documented everyday, except for Easter Sunday, between April 6
and May 28, 2000. We sampled 2 hours before and after the time of predicted low tide, for this is
when the intertidal is exposed and is most vulnerable to human disturbance. Some samples at
high tide were also taken to detect any differences in visitation according to tide height.
Observations were performed only during daylight hours.
A sample from a Site constituted a snapshot in time, when each person's location and
activity was documented for that day and particular time. Observations were made by first
beginning in Lot 1, sampling, then moving onto Lot 2, sampling, and continuing this procedure
