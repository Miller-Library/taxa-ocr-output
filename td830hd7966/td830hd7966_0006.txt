of Intensity are therefore count ha" sweep". Areas were estimated from an aerial photograph of
the study region. The surface areas of high, mid, and low intertidal zones could not be
determined separately, so only total intertidal Intensities could be calculated. Data were analyzed
to detect both spatial and temporal patterns of human visitation along Point Pinos as well as for
the frequencies of each activity.
Assessment of Biotic Community
In order to investigate the potential impact of trampling on the intertidal community at
Point Pinos, we compared two high-use and two low-use Sites based on the average intensity of
intertidal use at each Site. We tested for differences in species abundance and distribution among
the four Sites by running six randomly placed transects at each Site. The transects were all
approximately +2ft (+0.6m) above mean lower low water because the human activity data
indicated that most intertidal activity occurred in the mid intertidal (see Results). There were five
25mâ€™ quadrats distributed randomly along each 1Om transect. We estimated percent cover of all
the sessile species present, bare space and sand in each quadrat. Bare space was rock with
nothing growing on it. We also estimated the total number of limpets in each quadrat by
averaging the limpet count in four of the sixteen sub-divisions and multiplying by 16. We did not
differentiate between limpet species (which included Lottia pelta, Lottia digitalis, Lottia
limatula, Macclintockia scabra and Tectura scutum) because it was often too difficult to identify
them properly. We included limpets because they are small organisms with a hard shell that are
less susceptible to trampling than fleshy algae. We considered both susceptible and non-
susceptible species in order to detect natural variation between the Sites, independent from
human foot traffic.
