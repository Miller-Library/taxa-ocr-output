Despite local concerns, no study has investigated the character or effects of human
activity at Point Pinos in Pacific Grove, California. We investigated the patterns of human
activity at Point Pinos, focusing primarily on the rocky intertidal. We tried to establish which
human disturbances, i.e. collecting or trampling, were important on a local scale before sampling
at different Sites at Point Pinos to assess intertidal community change.
The aim of this study was to estimate the intensity of human use and potential
disturbance, to provide baseline data for future studies to establish a reasonable and quantitative
foundation for management and conservation of the Point Pinos rocky intertidal.
Materials and Methods
Point Pinos is located on the central coast of California, USA (36°38N, 121°57W)
directly north of Asilomar State Beach in Pacific Grove. Point Pinos is part of the Pacific Grove
Marine Gardens Refuge and is regulated by the California Department of Fish and Game. Unlike
most of the California coastline, it has a rocky intertidal which is easily accessible to its visitors.
This feature makes it an attractive place for tourist, locals and school classroom visits.
Wrapping around the northern-most point of the Monterey Peninsula, the study region
spans a length of approximately 1600 meters. Half of the region is exposed to the Pacific waters,
whereas the other half lies in the more protected Monterey Bay. The shoreline along the point
varies from steep rocky bluffs to sandy beaches. The rocky intertidal itself is even more irregular,
varying from a steep rock bench to gently sloping boulder fields. All of these attributes make
Point Pinos highly spatially variable (see Table of Descriptions in Appendix).
