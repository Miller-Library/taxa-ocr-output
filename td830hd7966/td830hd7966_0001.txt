Abstract
Human activity at Point Pinos, a popular rocky intertidal site in Pacific Grove, CA, was
quantified over a period of seven weeks from April 6, 2000 to May 28, 2000. Over 17.000
people were observed over the 7 weeks. Intensity of activity varied greatly among 9 contiguous
sites within Pt. Pinos, ranging from 12 to 36 people ha sweep (averaged over the 7 weeks for
each site). There was also a high degree of day-to-day variation with daily values ranging from
220 to nearly 700 per sweep, pooled over the entire Point. Of all visitors, only 18% ever entered
the rocky intertidal zone itself, with 280% remaining in the parking lots or on the sandy beach
areas. Data indicated that collecting, or taking of shells or invertebrates, occurred rarely.
Trampling appeared to be the greatest potential impact on sessile species located in the high and
mid intertidal zones. A comparison of the abundance of potentially susceptible (i.e. Pelvetiq
compressa) and non-susceptible (i.e. limpets) sessile species between high-use and low-use Sites
indicated that bare space increases at the high-use Sites. The abundance of non-susceptible
species did not differ significantly between Sites, whereas the abundance of susceptible species
decreased in the high-use Sites. Significant spatial variability between Sites revealed that
differences in species abundance between high-use and low-use Sites cannot solely be attributed
to trampling; hence, other factors such as sand scour and wave action may have contributed to
the heterogeneity.
