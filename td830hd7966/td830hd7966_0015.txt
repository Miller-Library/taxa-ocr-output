meaningful comparisons between different locations would be number of people per time (hour,
day, etc.) per area (ha, acre).
Some Sites, such as Lot 2 and Point Beach, had greater numbers of intertidal visitors than
did others, such as Lot 1 and Vertical. This can partly be attributed to the general features of the
Site such as availability of parking, access to the Shore, and scenic view (see Table of
descriptions in Appendix). This pattern of use is similar to spatial distributions of people found
in Australia, where fishermen were reported as having "favorite fishing spots" (Kingsford et al.
1991).
The high total intensities of use found in the Mid Intertidal Zone were a result of two
factors. First, four of the Sites lacked a High (rocky) Intertidal Zone (e.g. Lot 1, Lot 2, Banana,
and Point Beach). Second, each of the two Sites of the greatest intertidal intensity (e.g. Lot 2 and
Point Beach) had a promontory extending out from the Shore. To get to these points, visitors had
to walk across an isthmus which is approximately +2ft above MLLW at both Sites.
Greater numbers of people tended to visit Point Pinos during mid and low tide. School
classes often take advantage of the minus tides to have better access into the rocky intertidal. As
seen by the error bars in Fig. 3, there is a high degree of variation within each tide height group.
We think that intensity of human activity is more influenced by time of day than by state of the
tide. Future studies should incorporate interviews into their sampling methods in order to gain a
more accurate understanding of visitor activity.
Analysis of Biotic Community
The effects of a disturbance on natural communities depends on its spatial extent,
frequency, intensity and the season in which it occurs. Natural disturbances are usually seasonal
