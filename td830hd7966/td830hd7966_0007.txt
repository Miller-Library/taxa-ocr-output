The upper mid-intertidal community at Point Pinos is composed primarily of the red
algae Mastocarpus papillatus, Mazzealla affinis and Endocladia muricata. They often grow
close together, forming dense low-lying mats that are probably moderately susceptible to
trampling. The general morphology of M. papillatus and M. affinis are similar, both growing one
or more thalli from a disc-shaped holdfast. The equally divided blades are relatively broad,
growing to 10-15cm and 5-1Ocm, respectively. M. papillatus often has small bumps on the
blades and is red-brown to black. Thalli of M. affinis tend to be smoother and lighter in color,
from dark brown to olive green. The compact bushy E. muricata grows 4-6cm tall and is dark red
to blackish-brown (Abbott and Hollenberg 1976). The brown alga Pelvetia compressa is also
present and is probably more susceptible to trampling due to its morphology. The olive green
alga grows from a conical holdfast, extending 15-40cm. The fleshy thalli are usually cylindrical
near the base and compressed near the tips (Abbot and Hollenberg 1976). Various corallines and
other encrusting algae are also abundant. Corallina spp. are mostly purple or pink. The upright
form has many erect, branched, jointed thalli while the encrusting form produces a calcified crust
on the rock. For the purpose of this study, we grouped all the corallines when estimating percent
cover. The other encrusting algae that we encountered most frequently was the tetrasporic
"Petrocelis" stage of Mastocarpus that grows as a tar-like crust on the rocks.
Statistical Analysis
The percent cover or number of species was tested by a two-factor nested analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with the factors being Sites (fixed) and Transects-within-Sites (random).
The quadrats along each transect provided the replicates. The homogeneity of variances was
tested using Cochranâ€™s test (Winer, 1991) and an arcsine transformation was performed on the
