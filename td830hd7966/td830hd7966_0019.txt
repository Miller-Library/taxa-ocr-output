into the intertidal in order to access them. These promontories affect wave action around the
point, shielding some areas of the intertidal from wave energy and concentrating it in other areas.
At low tide, the rocky intertidal is exposed between the promontories and the main portions of
the shore. But the water starts to cover the isthmuses when it rises above +2ft MLLW, generating
a strong current. This is important because the current's unidirectional flow creates friction and
carries suspended material that can erode the algae from the rocks.
Water movement can also produce natural disturbances, such as moving small rocks and
overturning boulders when wave energy is high enough. Öther natural disturbances, such as
burn-off from sun exposure or the presence of marine mammals, can also generate significant
differences between sites. Otters and seals are frequently present at Great Tidepool and only
occasionally at the other Sites. They affect the rocky intertidal by eating organisms and by
hauling out on the rocks.
All four sites are located near sandy beaches. The sand covers the high rocky intertidal at
Lot 2, Point Beach and Banana. Point Beach and Lot 2 also experience relatively high wave
energy, possibly suspending large particles in the water that can scrape algae from the rocks.
Öther heterogeneities between the Sites include varying slopes of the intertidal,
differences in boulder sizes and type of subtratum beneath the boulders. The slope of the
intertidal is important because different species colonize at different heights in the intertidal. The
intertidal at Lot 2 extends horizontally for 20 meters at approximately the same height before
descending sharply into the subtidal. In contrast, Banana slopes gradually but consistently from
the shore to Oft MLLW. Although all four Sites are primarily boulder fields, the rock sizes vary
with the largest generally at Great Tidepool and Point Beach and the smallest at Lot 2. The
