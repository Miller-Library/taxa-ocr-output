through each Site until the sampler reached Great Tidepool. The completion of the 9 sampled
Sites constituted what we termed a "sweep" of the study region. It took approximately 30
minutes to document one sweep.
Activities that we recorded included fishing, walking, climbing, sitting, sitting in car,
standing, research, tidepooling, collecting, other and unknown. We denoted "collecting" as the
taking of dead animals (i.e. shells) or living invertebrates. If we saw a person with some kind of
container (plastic bag, bucket) or saw a person in the act, then the visitor was described as
collecting. "Tidepooling" described any person who was in the intertidal and was activity
observing the intertidal organisms, but not collecting them. "Unknown" included any person who
had either just arrived or just left the site when the sampler was sampling. "Research" described
people who were tracking sea otters for Sea Ötter Research and Conservation (SORAC) headed
by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "Other" encompassed activities such as driving through the
parking lot and playing soccer on the beach.
We recorded other factors such as the number of cars, bikes, buses, and pets. The
presence of a ranger, which usually entailed just a drive-by, was also noted. Lastly,
meteorological information such as tide height, temperature, wind speed, swell size, and sky
condition was logged.
Analysis of Human Activity Data
As the surface area of each Site differed, we standardized the counts in each Zone within
a Site to a per hectare (ha, 10' m2) basis. This measure permits direct, meaningful comparisons of
usage among Sites. This new unit, labeled Intensity, was calculated by dividing the count in à
given Site and Zone by the surface area of that zone and by the total number of sweeps. The units
