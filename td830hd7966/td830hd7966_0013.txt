and Lot 2, but was considerably lower at Point Beach (Fig. 11). Coralline algae was least
abundant at Lot 2, increasing slightly at Point Beach, and increasing more at the two high-use
Sites (Fig. 12).
There was no significant difference between the high-use and low-use Sites for our non-
susceptible species, the limpets (Fig. 13). All four sites averaged between 0 and 2 individuals per
0.25 m2. However, there was significant variation between transects within Sites, indicating a
patchy distribution on a scale of 10's of meters. There was also no significant difference between
M. papillatus (Fig. 14), M. affinis (Fig. 15) and encrusting algae (Fig. 16) populations at the
high and low use sites. Correspondingly, the species distribution of M. papillatus and encrusting
algae between sites was relatively regular. This is not the case for M. affinis because there was
considerable variation among the low use sites, ranging from 1% to 10% cover. Cover of M.
affinis was very high at Banana, but near zero at Great Tidepool.
Discussion
Patterns of Human Activity
Patterns of human activity were found to vary in both time and space. Generally, visits to
Point Pinos increased as the week progressed, and were most frequent on the weekends.
Beginning in early May, the total intensity of use at Point Pinos began to increase and peaked on
Memorial Day weekend. On one occasion, the combined presence of several school classes and
tour groups played a part in increasing the average intensity of a given weekday summed over all
