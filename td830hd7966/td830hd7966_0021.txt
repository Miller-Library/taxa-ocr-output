sites with the same substrate and physical characteristics, but no human activity. These pristine
sites would provide an excellent point of comparison for susceptible and non-susceptible species,
controlling for natural disturbances and seasonal variation. Only if susceptible species decline at
the Point while remaining constant or fluctuating at the control site and if non-susceptible species
do not decline at either site, would there be unequivocal evidence for human impacts.
