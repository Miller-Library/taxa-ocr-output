76% of all intertidal activity occurred in the mid intertidal. Lot 1, Lot 2, Banana, and Point Beach
lacked a high rocky intertidal zone, due to sand cover. Corner, Beach 2, and Great Tidepool
experienced the greatest intensity of use in the low intertidal; however, only 3.5% of all intertidal
visitors entered the low intertidal (Table in Appendix).
Frequencies of Activities Of the total number of visitors to Point Pinos, approximately 35%
were sitting in their cars; 20% were walking; 14% were sitting; 10% were standing; and 9% were
tidepooling. Approximately 1% of the total visitors were fishing. All other labeled activities each
comprised 5% of the total number of observed activities (Table in Appendix). Within the
Intertidal zone, the most frequent activities were tidepooling, walking, and climbing. Of the
3,149 intertidal visitors, 120 were collecting (#4%), defined as the taking of shells or
invertebrates. Most of the collectors appeared to be taking shells, rather than living invertebrates.
No tools were ever seen.
Preferred Sites for Particular Activities More people tended to tidepool at Lot 2, Golf Course,
and Point Beach than at any other Site (Table in Appendix). Visitors were least inclined to
tidepool at Lot 1 and Vertical. Fishermen preferred Lot 1 and Point Beach the most and Corner
and Beach 2 the least. A majority of the collecting (taking of shells or invertebrates) took place at
Lot 2, Beach 2, and Great Tidepool. Collecting was rare at Banana and Vertical. "Sitting in the
car" was a more common activity at Banana, Point Beach, Vertical, and Corner. It was less
frequent at Lot 1 and Great Tidepool. "Ã–ther" activities (mainly driving through the parking lot)
was the most frequent at Banana, followed by Point Beach, and then Vertical.
