a considerable portion of the cover there, suggesting that trampling is less severe at this Site.
Studies show that foliose species, such as P. compressa and Fucus gardneri, are particularly
susceptible to trampling because their small holdfasts connect them to the rock only at a single
point (Povey and Keough 1991; Beauchamp and Gowing 1982). Trampling also crushes and
breaks their elongate, fleshy thalli, destroying valuable reproductive organs (Murray 1997). In
our study, these susceptible species are entirely absent from Lot 2 and nearly absent from Point
Beach.
These large algae provide habitat heterogeneity by generating a protective canopy,
shielding underlying species from heat stress and desiccation. The removal of these protective
canopy species can significantly alter the community composition, opening bare space for
colonization and selecting for less susceptible algal species (Beauchamp and Gowing 1982).
Brown and Taylor (1999) found reduced animal densities resulting from the loss of algae cover
and associated sand. We did not quantify the mobile animals in our study, but qualitative
assessments suggest that chitons, crabs and various molluscs are more abundant at the high-use
Sites, beneath the canopy (personal observation). Keough and Quinn (1998) observed coralline
bleaching and fragmentation due to sun exposure associated with the reduction of the over-lying,
protective canopy. In our study, there is a significant difference between coralline algae
populations between the high-use and low-use Sites.
Canopy can provide protection against desiccation, but it can also prevent settlement
through whiplash, shading or space occupancy (Kim and DeWreede 1996). Correspondingly,
Brosnan and Crumrine (1994) observed that foliose species replaced turf forms when trampling
was prevented in experimental plots.
