INTRODUCTION
Computer models are frequently used in investigating complex
ecosystems. While field research describes the individual components of an
ecosystem, a model integrates these components. The aim is to produce a model
sufficiently simple to be instructive, but sufficiently complex to approximate the
natural world. Models are also useful when direct experimentation would be
destructive, as in most environmental research; one cannot manipulate an
ecosystem to discover the limits of its resilience. Simulations allow non-invasive
research.
Primary production in Monterey Bay is an ideal subject for an ecosystem
model. Considerable research has been done on the euphotic zone of the bay. A
model would organize the results of this research and allow further investigation
of the parameters regulating photosynthesis in the bay. In addition, because
photosynthesis produces the organic compounds required by all other organisms,
an accurate model of phytoplankton dynamics could potentially provide input
values for models of other bay ecosystems, from the kelp beds to the canyon
floor. For example, a detrital fallout term could serve as a "food source" for a
model of deep water communities.
This model uses recorded wind speeds, isotherm depths and irradiance
levels to generate weekly values for primary production and phytoplankton
biomass in the bay. The model follows the phytoplankton population for a user-
selected number of years. Although this simulation requires considerable added
complexity, it already provides information on several questions. For example,
using only light and nitrate levels, the model accurately predicts production levels.
