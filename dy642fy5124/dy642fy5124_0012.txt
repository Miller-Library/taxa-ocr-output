Because the total quantity of nutrients is limited, both in nature and in the
model, allowing them to pass quickly through the cycle (i.e. never "trapping" them
in grazer populations) increases their availability, and therefore increases
nutrient limited production. This allows the phytoplankton population to grow
well beyond natural limits. Maintaining a large grazer population would
introduce a lag time in nutrient cycling; nutrients used in production would not
immediately be available again. This, in turn, would decrease the simulation's
maximum biomass predictions. Potentially, this correction could also decrease
the six week time difference between predicted and actual peaks in production.
Unfortunately, this correction is not as easy as it may seem, because little data is
available on grazing rates or zooplankton biomass in the bay.
There are many other possible explanations for the errors in biomass
predictions. For instance, the current model determines the quantity of recycled
nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) from production equations, using a ratio of
new:total production. Phytoplankton biomass is ignored. In nature, the
availability of recycled nutrients clearly depends on phytoplankton and grazer
populations, as these nutrients result from the decomposition of organisms and
from excretion. Adding this dependence would improve the model's predictive
capability.
The detrital fallout term, which includes all organic matter leaving the
euphotic zone, should also be a function of biomass. As with recycled nitrogen
levels, fallout is more closely related to population size than to production. The
model now exports an amount of detritus equal to the production from four
weeks previous. In fact, this term should vary with biomass; it should be greater
than production when the phytoplankton biomass (and therefore grazing) is high,
