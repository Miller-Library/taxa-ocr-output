ABSTRACT
This model of primary production in Monterey Bay predicts weekly
phytoplankton growth under given environmental conditions. Growth values are
then combined with equations for fallout, advection, and nutrient recycling to
calculate each week's phytoplankton biomass. The model's predictions,
especially for production, compare well to actual measurements for the bay. The
model also predicts a small winter phytoplankton bloom resulting from nitrate
accumulation. This bloom has been observed in the field. With additional
complexity, this simulation could provide input terms for future bay models.
