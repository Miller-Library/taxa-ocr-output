and considerably lower than production when the population is low. Changing
the program to include this relationship would decrease peak biomass
predictions, because as the phytoplankton population started to climb, the fallout
term would also increase.
Another inaccuracy in the model is the use of weekly averages in
calculating production and biomass; living phytoplankton encounter
instantaneous, rather than average conditions. They are subject both to the
maximum and to the minimum light levels and nitrogen concentrations.
Averaging conditions masks environmental extremes. This is an inherent
problem with mathematical models; it is possible, to calculate population
changes instantaneously, but it is not possible, with current measurement
techniques, to determine instantaneous environmental conditions.
A complete bay model is clearly a distant goal, but this simulation is a first
step. Its predictions for primary productivity approach actual measurements,
supporting the initial assumption that photosynthesis in the bay is primarily
regulated by light and nitrate levels. The biomass predictions may improve and
could potentially be used to drive future models. Further, the model highlights
several components of the bay requiring further research: grazing rates in the
euphotic zone, nutrient flows between bay ecosystems, and mesopelagic
communities
