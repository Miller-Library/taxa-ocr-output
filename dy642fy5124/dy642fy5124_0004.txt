MATERIALS & METHODS
This model of primary production in Monterey Bay derives weekly
phytoplankton biomass values and production rates from known environmental
conditions (Figure 1 & Table 1). The model is written in Turbo C (Appendix 1).
It runs for a user-selected number of years. Instead of running a full simulation,
the user can opt to set fallout to zero (allowing for exponential growth) or to hold
the phytoplankton biomass constant.
WEEKLY PRODUCTION
In Monterey Bay, nitrogen, supplied as either nitrate (NO3) or ammonia
(NH4), is thought to be the limiting nutrient in photosynthesis. Upwelling is the
primary source of surface water NO3 in the bay. Although some nitrogen may
diffuse upward across the nutricline, and some may be carried in fresh water
runoff, these terms are considered negligible.
Ekman’s theory (Ekman, 1905, quoted in Mendo, et al., 1987) provides the
algorithms used in calculating the mass of water upwelled per time interval.
Values are determined as follows, using the Coriolis parameter (f) for this
latitude, and the monthly-mean wind stress (r) off the California coast (Breaker
& Broenkow, 1987)
E = 1/f
f=2() * sin(37)
(Bakun, 1973, quoted in Mendo, et al., 1987)
In the equation for f, is the angular velocity of the earth’s rotation, and 37 is the
latitude in degrees. Because the wind parallels the coastline, the entire wind
