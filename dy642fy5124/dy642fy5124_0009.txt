RESULTS
Running this simulation generates predictions of phytoplankton biomass
(Figures 4 & 5), nitrate (NO3) levels (Figure 6), and primary production (Figure
7). All of these terms are calculated on a weekly basis. Comparing the model's
output in these areas with actual measurements taken in the bay provides
feedback on the accuracy of the simulation.
Average phytoplankton biomass in the bay is easily measurable. The
precision of the computer-generated biomass figures can therefore be evaluated.
This comparison suggests that, although the trends in simulated values follow the
yearly cycle observed in the bay, with peak populations reached in the early
spring, the model's values are not yet close enough to be of use in predictions
(Figure 9). In fact, the model's maximum values are three times actual
measurements.
As previously stated, NO3 levels are calculated weekly, in mg NO3
upwelled, per m2, per week. These values cannot be quantitatively compared
with the instantaneous NO3 concentrations measured in the field, because there
is no obvious way to convert from instantaneous to weekly concentrations. As a
result, the accuracy of the simulation with respect to this variable cannot be
assessed. The increase in nitrate levels predicted for January and February,
however, agrees qualitatively with field observations. In addition, since NO3
levels are used in calculating production, the high correlation between real and
actual production values suggests that the NO3 predictions are also reasonable.
