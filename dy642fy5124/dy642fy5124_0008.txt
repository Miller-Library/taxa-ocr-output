Recycled nitrogen (NH4)- the final term used in calculating biomass - is
simply set equal to the difference between total production and new production.
Because the model adds only 25% of weekly production to weekly biomass, only
25% of the recycled nitrogen is subtracted each week.
The final equation for phytoplankton population is:
phyto (wk+1) - phyto(wk) +25(prodn(wk)-recy(wk))-detritus(wk)
where
detritus(wk) = new production(wk-4)
and
recyc (wk) - production(wk)- new production(wk)
Before discussing the results of the simulation, there are several
underlying assumptions that require justification. First, the model ignores the
accepted equations relating photosynthesis to changes in temperature. This
probably does not introduce significant error, given the relative constancy of the
water temperature in Monterey Bay. The model also disregards the relationship
between phytoplankton density and euphotic zone depth. Although the
extinction coefficient for chlorophyll a is actually quite high, Platt’s equation for
production as a function of PAR already factors in this consideration. Adjusting
the model's PAR values for phytoplankton density would therefore be redundant.
The final, and most questionable assumption is that light and nitrogen level are
the most important variables influencing primary production in the bay. This
assumption is not obvious, but the relative accuracy of the model’s predictions
supports its validity.
