Comparison with actual data suggests that the model is most successful in
simulating primary production (Figure 8). In order to determine total weekly
production, the model calculates light limited and nitrogen limited production
(Figure 11); actual production is the smaller of these values. In a given time
period, if the light limited term is smaller than the nitrogen limited term, light is
considered to be limiting. During such a time period, excess NO3 remains in the
euphotic zone. In the model this occurs yearly, during January and February. In
the spring, when light levels increase, the accumulated NO3 predicted by the
model supports a brief phytoplankton bloom (Figure 12). This bloom has been
observed in the field.
Production in the bay, while not as easily calculated as average biomass,
can be determined. Comparing simulated and actual production values results in
a correlation coefficient of.7, which is significant at the .01 level (Figure 8). In
other words, the variables used in the model explain 50% of the variance seen in
phytoplankton primary production. This correlation increases to.8 (and thus
explains 64% of the variance in primary production) if the simulated values are
shifted forward six weeks. Perhaps the model does not correctly account for the
lag time between upwelling and production.
