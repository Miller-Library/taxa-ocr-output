This unexpected accuracy supports the original assumption that irradiance level
and nitrogen supply are the two most important factors limiting photosynthesis in
the bay.
In addition to answering questions about the bay, this simulation suggests
several directions for further field research. For example, accurate
measurements of zooplankton biomass and grazing rates are not yet available.
Without these figures, the model considerably overestimates peak phytoplankton
populations.
Similarly, research on benthic communities is ongoing, and the importance
of mesopelagic organisms to bay nutrient cycles was recognized only recently.
Both of these areas must be researched more thoroughly before a model of the
entire Monterey Bay can be completed.
