stress contributes to upwelling. Upwelled water is assumed to originate at a
depth of fifty meters (Barber & Smith, 1981).
Upwelled water brings with it some mass of NO3 per unit volume. This
concentration is determined according to the equation:
[NO3 = 32.9-.172(z) (r = 0.998)
where z is the depth of the ten-degree isotherm (Breaker & Broenkow, 1987).
This value, multiplied by the volume of water upwelled, predicts the amount of
NO3 carried upward into the euphotic zone.
Upwelling primarily occurs in the mouth of the bay (Figure 2). The above
equations calculate the mass of NO3 upwelled per meter of coastline. Of the
water in which this NO3 is dissolved, at most half flows into the bay; the
remainder flows into the open ocean. Advection further decreases the supply of
nitrogen to the euphotic zone. To account for these factors, this simulation
divides the total amount of upwelled NO3 by four. The result is a mass of NO3
available for primary production in the bay per meter of coastline, per week. The
model then divides this figure by the mean width of the bay in order to simulate
diffusion over the bay. Finally, since phytoplankton incorporate approximately
six times as much carbon as nitrogen, the model multiplies the upwelled NO3 by
5.8 to convert to "carbon equivalents."
The model then derives a value for total, nitrogen limited, primary
production - that is, production supported both by "new" nitrogen (upwelled
NO3) and by NHA recycled by heterotrophs. According to Eppley and Peterson
(1979), new and total production are related by:
new/total =.0025(total)
