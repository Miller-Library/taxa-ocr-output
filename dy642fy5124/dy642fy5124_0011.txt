DISCUSSION
Primary production in Monterey Bay is far more complex than this model
suggests. The only independent variables used in the model are
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), wind stress and isotherm depth. The
euphotic zone in the bay is influenced by many other environmental factors.
Similarly, the model only follows phytoplankton populations, while in the bay,
population dynamics depend on the interactions of many different groups of
organisms.
Given the simplicity of the model, the accuracy of the simulation is
interesting. Why should primary production in the bay be predictable using only
nitrate concentrations and light levels? Possibly, the model's algorithms, although
simplistic, already include the most important factors regulating production. If
nitrate were not the limiting nutrient in the bay, nitrate concentrations would not
correlate to primary productivity. Similarly, if sunlight were not limiting, light
levels would be irrelevant in predicting production. The fact that these variables
are sufficient to calculate productivity implies that they are regulatory.
The model is less successful in predicting biomass than weekly production;
peak biomass figures are overestimated by a factor of three. Adding a grazer
population would partially eliminate this inaccuracy. In nature, photosynthesis
supports not only the producers themselves but also populations of heterotrophs
and carnivores. By contrast, in this simulation, production is briefly incorporated
in the phytoplankton population and then immediately recycled or lost as
detritus.
