for total production « 200 (gC/m2year). For total production greater than this
amount, this model uses the ratio:
new/total =.75
(modified from Eppley and Peterson, 1979, using Dugdale, 1985).
In the bay, phytoplankton growth is sometimes limited by light rather than
nitrogen availability. This model therefore calculates a weekly light limited value
for production using Platt, et al.’s equation:
biomass
Prodn = (0.069 + 0.45(1o)
(mg Chlam?
(1988). lo is the incident radiation (Einsteins/m2). The biomass is converted
from mg carbon to mg chlorophyll a according to a variable ratio (Figure 3). This
ratio changes with season because phytoplankton produce more chlorophyll a per
unit carbon during the winter months, when light levels are lower. Total
production is the smaller of this light limited value and the nitrogen limited value
calculated above.
During execution, the model keeps track of a NO3 pool in the euphotic
zone. At the start of each week's calculations, the NO3 upwelled is added to this
pool. If production for the week is nitrogen limited, the pool is totally depleted-
i.e. set to zero. If production is biomass limited, Eppley and Peterson's ratio
(described above) is applied to determine the amount of production supported by
NO3. The NO3 pool is then decremented by this amount. Any NO3 left in the
pool is used in the next week's production calculations.
