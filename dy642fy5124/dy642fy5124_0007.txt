The phytoplankton biomass is incremented weekly. The original model
added 95% of the calculated weekly production to the previous week's biomass.
5% of the production was assumed to be lost from the system as dissolved organic
matter (DÖM). Running the model with these figures, however, resulted in
unreasonably high phytoplankton populations. The final model still subtracts 5%
of each week's production, but adds only 25% of the remaining production to the
week's biomass. The portion of production not taken up by phytoplankton
probably goes to support grazer populations, for which this model does not yet
account.
The biomass calculation has two loss terms: detrital fallout - nutrients
totally lost from the system - and recycled matter - nutrients remaining in the
euphotic zone but no longer incorporated in living phytoplankton. Both terms
include many natural processes, but this model does not distinguish these
processes.
For steady state to be maintained, the nitrogen lost from the system must
equal the upwelled nitrogen. Little is known, however, about the time span over
which equilibrium is reached. The model was run several times with different
input values to determine a reasonable value for this time lag. Exporting NO3
one week after it was upwelled resulted in a constant phytoplankton population,
because all production was immediately lost as fallout. On the other hand, if the
lag time for NO3 loss was too long, the simulated population grew well above
observed limits. The best estimate for the lag time appears to be one month.
The model therefore equates detrital fallout to NÖ3-supported phytoplankton
growth from four weeks previous.
