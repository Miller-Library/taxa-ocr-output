collected using the Johnson Sea Link II manned submersible in the
Atlantic Ocean. (Table 1)
Specimen Collection
Individual medusae were captured in a detritus sampler
[transparent acrylic cylinders with lids; designed by Harbor Branch
Oceanographic Institute, Inc (HBOI)). Additional medusae were
collected using a variable speed suction sampler (HBOI) with five
sample jars. Once the samplers were removed from the ROV, the
medusae were transferred to round tupperware containers and
stored in a cooler maintained at 5Â°C. Specimens were transferred
within two hours of the initial transfer from the samplers to an
aquarium and kept under controlled conditions.
Eighteen specimens of Benthocodon spp were collected
between April 9, 1993 and May 24, 1993. Fourteen medusae were
maintained for laboratory and microscope studies. Three specimens
that were preserved immediately on board ship and 8 medusae that
were maintained in lab were used for gut content analysis. One
specimen was identified as Benthocodon hyalinus and was not used
for this study.
Laboratory studies
Four organisms were maintained in an aquarium with 50C
running sea water in the deep sea lab under dark conditions; ten
specimens under light conditions. Two medusae were kept in a .62 m
*42 m *.18m aquarium; the remaining 2 in a 41 m*.2 m *.27 m
aquarium. They were fed 24 hours later with Tigriopus californicus
and Artemia salina. Ten minutes before feeding, water flow was
discontinued. Approximately 20 prey organisms were placed into the
