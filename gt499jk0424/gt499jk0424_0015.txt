Aside from their role in prey capture, histological studies on
the tentacles show properties which suggest other functions. Unlike
the inner tentacles, the outer tentacles lack digestive inclusions,
which may aid in digestion and/or storage, even though the fact that
the tentacles extend from the edge of the subumbrella suggests that
they are both extensions of the gastrovascular cavity. However,
because the outer tentacles appear to be easily shed, as evidenced by
the presence of tentacles in the aquarium post mortem and by their
presence in the temporary tupperware containers during collection,
they would be useless as storage or digestive structures. The inner
tentacles, however, remain attached to the subumbrella, so these
activities are maintained. In the case of prey capture, the shedding of
tentacles attached to vigorously swimming prey may be more
beneficial than expending the extra energy needed to subdue the
organism. As a predator avoidance mechanism, medusae whose
tentacles are entangled in mucoid nets produced by predators such
as siphonophores, ctenophores, and other medusae can readily
escape by leaving their tentacles. Again, confirmation of these
hypotheses depends on further behavioral observations.
Feeding behavior, however, has not been observed in situ,
because Benthocodon medusae are most likely sensitive to the lights
from the ROV, just as they are sensitive to light conditions in the lab.
Another hypothesis is Benthocodon may not be feeding in the early
afternoon when observations are made. Gut contents were found in
all five specimens collected during night dives but in only one
collected during dives made in the late mornings and early
afternoons. This suggests a rhythmical feeding pattern that may
