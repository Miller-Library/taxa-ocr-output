Benthocodon contracts its bell, fluid is propelled out of the
subumbrella cavity and through the inner tentacles on the tentacle
margin, where prey is contacted and entangled by nematocyst
threads. When the medusa relaxes, water refills the cavity by
flowing inward through the outer tentacles where prey is again
captured by nematocyst threads. By this mechanism, the close
spacing of tentacles is advantageous to B. pedunculata in sieving out
small organisms (e. g. copepods and amphipods). During each short
upward-swimming and sinking bout, the tentacles are extended to
sieve prey from the vertical water column through a cylindrical
contact space, characteristic of other trachymedusae (Larson et al.,
1989). The inner and outer tentacles that extend downward perform
the initial sieving of the water column and the outer tentacles that
are more widely spaced and extend above the bell margin may serve
to capture organisms that have escaped through the sieve.
The feeding on benthic organisms may involve a slightly
different feeding strategy. Because Benthocodon medusae are
frequently found on the ocean floor, tentacles probing over the
sediment surface may be important in detecting sessile organisms
such as pycnogonids and foraminiferans. Benthic organisms can also
be captured when uncovered and uplifted from the sediment during
disturbances caused by the upward-swimming and sinking bouts,
like hydromedusae Polyorchis penicillatus (Mills, 1981). These
mechanisms assume that these medusae do detect prey are
hypotheses to be further tested with in situ and laboratory
experiments.
