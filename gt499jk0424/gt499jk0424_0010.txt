12 u in width. Both types of nematocysts are found on the inner and
outer tentacles (Fig. 11, 12) with a MAN: MSN ratio of about 3:1.
Ultrastructure of extruded nematocysts were observed with
both the phase contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope
(Fig. 14, 15, 16). The average lengths of the extruded shaft of MAN
and MSN are 7.1841.11 u (n=78) and 10.29+1.58 u (n=54),
respectively. Three stylets are visible on the shaft of both
nematocyst types, near the base of the thread (Fig. 14a, 15, 16). Also
common to both types are spiraled barbs that travel the length of the
extended threads (Fig. 15,16). These threads extend up to 261 u in
length.
Discussion
Patches of Benthocodon pedunculata were frequently found
hovering over or resting on the ocean floor, suggesting that they may
feed on benthopelagic organisms, most of which are crustaceans
(Kelly, 1992), and benthic organisms, of which the foraminiferan
Globerigina bulloides constitute 40% of collected animals (Petry,
1992). Attempts to observe feeding in the lab by introducing
medusae to Tigriopus californicus and Artemia salina were
unsuccessful because the gastrovascular cavities of medusae were
completely empty. Nevertheless, it is inconclusive whether the
medusae are not eating because of the conditions of the aquarium or
because Tigriopus and Artemia are not palatable. The specimens
may have been damaged during collection and lack of outer tentacles
may have prevented the medusae from capturing the prey.
Specimens of Benthocodon pedunculata maintained in the
aquarium under controlled conditions showed sensitivity to
