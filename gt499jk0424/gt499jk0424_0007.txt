series, 10 mL of 50% LR white resin solution (mixed 1:1 with 100%
ethanol) was added to each sample and the vials were rotated at 40(
for 2 hours. The supernatant was replaced with 10 mL of a 75% resin
solution, followed by rotation 4Â°C for 2 hours. The procedure was
repeated with a 100% solution, then the sample was kept in fresh
100% resin solution overnight. The following day, the samples were
placed into a100% resin solution in plastic capsules and heated until
the plastic solidified. A Sorvall ultramicrotome was used to make 0.5
u sections along the longitudinal axis of two outer tentacles and four
inner tentacles from two medusae. The sections were then fixed onto
slides by heating over a bunsen burner. Basic fuchsin and methylene
blue dyes were used to stain the samples. Slides were examined
using the Zeiss Axioskop compound microscope under 100x oil
immersion phase contrast and photographs were taken using an
Olympus OM25 35mm SLR.
Results
Observations of Benthocodon pedunculata in situ (Fig. 1)
revealed that these reddish-brown pigmented trachymedusae hover
near or sit on the ocean floor. They are generally found in patches in
the Soquel Canyon. Characteristic of this species is the presence of
three types of tentacles (Fig. 1) that seem to differ in morphology
(Fig. 1, 2). There appears to be two types of outer tentacles, although
structural differences were difficult to detect with the ROV because
the medusae rapidly swam away from view. One group of outer
tentacles curved downward and in toward the subumbrella while the
other group seemed to extend upward and outward (Fig. 1). The
inner tentacles are the third type, those closest to the subumbrella
