Axioskop compound microscope under 100x oil immersion phase
contrast and photographs were taken using an Olympus OM2S 35mm
SLR with Ektar 100 and Ektachrome 160T films. Unpreserved outer
and inner tentacles from two specimens were transferred from the
aquarium into a vial of distilled water. After five minutes the
tentacles were squashed onto slides. Uncollected tentacles were
placed into a petri dish filled with sea water and maintained at 50C
temperature and analyzed for nematocyst activity.
Measurements of the lengths and widths of nematocysts from
22 unpreserved outer tentacles and 3 unpreserved inner tentacles
from two specimens were taken using a Dage-MTI digital 81 series
high resolution camera with a TECON frame grabber board version
2.0 and the Bioscan OPTIMAS image processing program for
Microsoft Windows. Nematocyst lengths were measured from the
opening of the nematocyst or base of shaft directly to the other end.
Widths were measured from the widest points of the nematocyst.
The ultrastructure of nematocysts and tentacles of this
trachymedusa was studied using an Hitachi S-450 scanning electron
microscope. Tentacles fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde were transferred to
30% ethanol and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series to 100%
ethanol, 10 minutes in each concentration. Following dehydration, the
samples were critical point dried with CO2 and sputter coated with a
100A layer of gold in a Denton vacuum evaporator.
For histological study, five outer and seven inner tentacles
were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series: from 50%, 60%, 70%,
80%, 90%, to 95% ethanol in scintillation vials at room temperature
for15 minutes at each concentration. Following the dehydration
