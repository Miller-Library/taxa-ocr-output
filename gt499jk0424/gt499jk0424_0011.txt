fluorescent light, as measured by differences in survival time. The
four specimens maintained under dark conditions survived one to
three days longer than those under light conditions. However, the
four that survived longer were collected by detritus samplers while
the others were collected using a variable speed suction sampler.
This apparent sensitivity to light, then, may actually be sensitivity to
the method of collection. The detritus sampler is probably less
damaging to the specimens than the suction samplers. Of the four
medusae collected by detritus samplers and maintained in tanks of
different depths under dark conditions, the two that were in the
deeper tank (.27 m) survived three days longer than the two in the
shallower tank (.18 m). This difference in survival time may be
caused by the slight change in pressure between the two tanks or by
the difference in nutritional state of the medusae upon collection.
The ones that survived the longest may have fed just before being
collected.
Gut content analysis did reveal recognizable prey in six out of
eight specimens that were not used for feeding experiments. Copepod
and amphipod exoskeletons were discovered in five medusae and
exoskeleton debris was found in all six. Because these crustaceans
are non-sessile organisms that inhabit the benthopelagic
environment (Kelly, 1992; Wishner, 1980b; Gage and Tyler, 1991),
the trachymedusae probably have tentacles that allow them to
capture these prey organisms. Sessile benthic organisms that live in
the sediment of the ocean floor, e. g. pycnogonid and foraminiferans,
were also discovered in the gut contents, indicating that Benthocodon
