Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Point Lobos crew and ROV pilots for
collecting the jellies, Chuck Baxter for his helpful advice and for
taking me out on collecting trips with the ROV. I am grateful to Chris
Patten and Kurt Buck for their microscope expertise, Alan Baldridge
and Susan Baxter for helping me find obscure journals and books,
and Molly Cummings for teaching me how to be a real marine biology
student. Thanks to the many spring students who suffered through
seasickness with me on the Point Lobos and Mamp;M fever on
Thursdays. Most importantly, I thank George I. Matsumoto for his
