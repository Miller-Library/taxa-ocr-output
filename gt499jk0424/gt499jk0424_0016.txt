coincide with the downward and upward migrations of zooplankton.
Benthocodon would then be expected to feed at night and early
morning. Therefore, all the specimens collected later in the day
would lack gut contents, as observed in two of the three fixed on
board ship. This hypothesis, however, needs to be further tested with
dives made at different times of the day.
This study was limited by the number of specimens that were
examined for both gut contents and tentacle structures and the small
amount of time in behavioral observations using the submersible.
The optimal conditions for maintaining Benthocodon pedunculata
were unknown and the handling of medusae during collection may
have stressed the specimens. Morphology revealed by microscope
studies may also be biased by preparation of these fragile, gelatinous
samples. Regardless of these possible sources of error, this study
provides a description of the morphological features of this
benthopelagic medusae that were previously unexamined.
Postulations about their relationship to function requires further
behavioral observations.
This research has contributed new information about the
structural features of this benthopelagic medusae that are found in
high density patches in the Soquel and Carmel Canyons (Larson et al.
1992). The near bottom environment and the organisms that thrive
there are virtually unknown. It is fascinating to study the
morphological adaptations of benthopelagic medusae to this
environment and to explore their interactions with other deep sea
organisms, as more information is collected using ROVs. Information
about these survival mechanisms lead to an understanding of the
