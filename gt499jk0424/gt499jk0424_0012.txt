pedunculata probably have mechanisms that allow them to feed
while resting on the deep-sea floor.
The two nematocyst types found in collected specimens (MAN
and MSN) are present on the inner and outer tentacles. The MANs
were found to be more abundant than MSNs on both tentacles, with
an approximate MAN to MSN ratio of 3:1. The structural similarities
between the two nematocyst types are the three spicules on the
shaft and the spiraled barbs on the long threads. Observable
differences are the sizes of the nematocyst capsule and the shaft,
both of which is larger in the MSN. The MSN possibly allows
Benthocodon to capture larger prey, although the larger number of
MAN found on the tentacles suggest that Benthocodon may feed
more often on smaller prey. Both stenoteles (Hufnagel et al., 1985)
and aspiroteles have been characterized as probable penetrants
(Kramp, 1935), but those found in B. pedunculata have long barbed
threads that differentiate Benthocodon nematocysts from the
traditional nematocyst description.
Microscope studies of tentacular and nematocyst morphology
assumed to play a crucial role in prey capture reveal properties that
allow Benthocodon pedunculata to capture both small, hard-bodied
organisms and larger, gelatinous organisms. In trachymedusa
Tesserogastria musculosa, the unbarbed thread of the stenotele was
shown to penetrate between two joints of a copepod leg (Hesthagen,
1971). In Benthocodon pedunculata, the barbed thread may both
penetrate exoskeletons of crustaceans and wrap around to and
adhere to soft-bodied prey, because use of penetration exclusively
may tear through the mesoglea and allow gelatinous organisms to
