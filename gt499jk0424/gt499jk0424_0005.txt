aquarium near the outer tentacles of each medusa. Five minute
observations of medusa behavior were made every fifteen minutes
for 1 hour. Dead specimens were immediately removed from the
aquarium and preserved in 3% glutaraldehyde.
Gut Contents
Eleven medusae from the Soquel Canyon and five specimens
collected from the western Atlantic using the Johnson Sea Link II
manned submersible on October 29, 1991 (described in Larson et al.,
1992). The entire digestive system--mouth, stomach, and peduncle--
was removed from the subumbrella and transferred to filtered sea
water for microdissection using a Nikon SM2-U Type 104 dissecting
scope with light field/dark field illumination and fiber optic lights
(Bausch & Lomb Fiber-Lite). Photographs of some samples were
taken using a Nikon 35 mm camera and a Nikon HFX-DX electronic
camera system. The grooves of the stomach were examined for prey
All items found were identified to the lowest taxonomic level
possible and transferred to glass vials filled with 70% ethanol.
Microscope studies
Eight specimens were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and then
placed in successive ethanol concentrations up to 100%. The general
structure of the medusa was examined under a dissecting microscope
and the structure of 22 outer tentacles and six inner tentacles from 6
different specimens were examined with a light compound
microscope. Squash preparations of eight preserved tentacle margins
from 4 different medusae were made on slides after rinsing the
entire specimen in freshwater and replacing the water with 30%
ethanol. Nematocyst structures were examined using a Zeiss
