described (Marsical, 1974). The nematocysts may adhere to, wrap
around, penetrate, or paralyze prey, but the actual mechanism of
discharge is poorly understood (Laverack and Dando, 1987). It has
been proposed that discharge is dependent on chemical and/or
mechanical stimuli, such as triggers extending from the nematocyst
known as cnidocils.
Recent observations from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV),
working in the Monterey Submarine Canyon, reveal that the
medusae live primarily near the deep-sea floor and may be potential
predators of benthic or benthopelagic crustaceans. Because so little is
known about these specialized structures along the tentacles that are
crucial to the survival of B. pedunculata , the morphology of the
nematocysts are interesting to study, particularly if nematocyst type
affects the type of prey captured. This study investigates the gross
morphology of the medusae, tentacle types, and nematocyst types
using phase contrast and scanning electron microscopy. Prey type
will be determined by gut analysis of collected specimens. It is
hypothesized that because Benthocodon pedunculata are typically
found on or near the bottom of the ocean floor, they would have
tentacles and nematocysts that would allow them to feed on
benthopelagic crustaceans and other benthic organisms.

Location
Eighteen specimens of Benthocodon spp. were collected on five
dives using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's
(MBARI) ROV Ventana from the RV Point Lobos. Five specimens were
