and shorter and thinner than the outer tentacles (Fig. 3, 4). The outer
tentacles have an abscission point, which is absent on the inner
tentacles (Fig. 5). Even when fully extended in the uncontracted
medusa, the tentacles are numerous and closely spaced (Fig. 1).
Morphological differences between the two outer tentacles were
indistinguishable in the lab and the two types were therefore
grouped together as outer tentacles.
Laboratory observations of 14 specimens of Benthocodon
pedunculata showed that they were sensitive to prolonged exposure
to fluorescent light. The two medusae maintained in the deeper tank
under dark conditions survived for six days, the ten medusae in the
shallow tank under light conditions died in less than two days, and
the two specimens kept in the shallow tank under dark conditions
were alive for three days. The specimens from the .18 m deep tank
were often seen swimming near the surface while the two medusae
in the .27 m deep tank were frequently observed to be resting on the
bottom.
Feeding experiments began within two days of specimen
collection. Observations of medusae after exposure to either
Tigriopus californicus or Artemia salina showed no visible change in
behavior. Dissection of these medusae showed empty digestive tracts.
Further post mortem examinations showed that only the inner
tentacles were left attached to the edge of the subumbrella. All outer
tentacles and a few inner ones were left intact at the bottom of the
aquarium.
Although the dissections of eight medusae that were
maintained in the lab revealed no gut contents, analysis of eight
