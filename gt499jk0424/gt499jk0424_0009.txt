specimens that were immediately fixed on board ship showed
recognizable prey in six of the eight (Table 2), five of which were
collected during night dives and one during an afternoon dive (Table
1). Copepod and amphipod (Fig. 6) exoskeletons were discovered in
all the dissected specimens. One pycnogonid exoskeleton (Fig. 7), 22
Globigerina foraminiferans, and several unidentified exoskeletons
were also found. The remaining two did not have any gut contents.
Like other trachymedusae, the tentacles of Benthocodon
pedunculata stem from the edge of the subumbrella (Fig. 8 ). There
are 3 or 4 uneven rows of tentacles (Fig. 9). The inner tentacle is
annulated, completely encircled by rings containing nematocysts (Fig.
10a). The rings disappear at the tip of the tentacle, where
nematocysts cover the entire surface (Fig. 10b). Nematocysts within
these rings are at various orientations and are adjacent to
undifferentiated interstitial cells (Fig. 11a, b). Digestive inclusions are
found in the gastrodermis of the inner tentacles (Fig. 11a) but not in
the outer tentacles. The outer tentacle is more heavily pigmented
and nematocysts and interstitial cells are distributed along the entire
surface area (Fig. 12a, b). The nematocysts are positioned at various
orientations, as shown by the orientation of the shaft and the wound
thread (Fig. 12b). The nematocyst types are modified versions of the
stenotele and aspirotele nematocysts (Marsical, 1974). Lengths and
widths of nematocysts from both the tentacle types were measured
and fell into two categories (Fig. 14). Modified-aspirotele
nematocysts (MAN) were measured and ranged from 8-13 u in
length and 4-6 u in width while modified-stenotele nematocysts
(MSN) were measured with a range from 11-15 u in length and 10-
