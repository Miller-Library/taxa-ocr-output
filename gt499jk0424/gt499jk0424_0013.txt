escape. Hydrozoans that feed on microcrustaceans often have
nematocysts concentrated in batteries and filiform tentacles whereas
those possessing nematocysts with extremely long threads and thick
tentacles often feed on larger gelatinous organisms (Purcell and Mills,
1988). Nematocysts and tentacles of Benthocodon pedunculata have
both properties. The thin, inner tentacles have nematocysts
concentrated in batteries except for the very tip of the tentacle,
which suggest that they may function in capturing the copepods,
amphipods, and other crustaceans discovered in the gut contents. In
contrast, nematocysts are spread out over the large, outer tentacles,
suggesting that these trachymedusae also feed on gelatinous prey
that are probably more difficult to detect than exoskeleton debris in
gut dissections. Therefore, these medusae may actually be feeding on
other benthopelagic or benthic medusae, even though gelatinous
prey was not observed.
Prey capture is probably determined by swimming pattern,
tentacle posture (Mills, 1981), and nematocyst type (Purcell, 1984;
Barnes, 1987; Purcell and Mills, 1988; Harrison and Westfall, 1991).
Benthocodon pedunculata were observed to swim rapidly upwards
from the deep-sea floor, then drift slowly downwards, extending
their tentacles (Larson et al., 1992), as well as actively swimming
through the water column, although this may be biased by ROV
disturbances in the water current. Prey capture in swimming
medusae, therefore, may depend on vortexes produced by bell
pulsations and the resulting water flow through the tentacles lining
the bell margin and into the subumbrella cavity, similar to the
feeding mode of scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita (Costello, 1992). As
