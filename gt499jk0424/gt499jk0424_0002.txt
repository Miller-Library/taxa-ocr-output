(Wishner, 1980a), with some copepods found exclusively in the
benthopelagic boundary (Wishner, 1980b). Crustaceans are the
dominant arthropods in the deep sea (Gage and Tyler, 1991) and in
terms of density in the Monterey Canyon, the most abundant
crustacean was shown to be copepods (Kelly, 1992). Therefore,
benthopelagic medusae, e.g. Benthocodon pedunculata, may prey on
copepods and other abundant deep-sea crustaceans (Larson et al.,
1992) and have distinctive morphological features which allow them
to live in the deep-sea benthopelagic environment.
There are several characteristic features of the order
Trachymedusa, to which Benthocodon pedunculata belongs (Mayor,
1910; Marshall and Williams, 1971). Trachymedusae are generally
carnivorous and either active or passive predators (Laverack and
Dando, 1987). All members are mobile medusae whose tentacles are
hollow and stem from the margins of the umbrella. These tentacles
are structures that are specialized for prey capture and defense. The
gonads are developed from the radial canals. The body wall has 3
basic layers: epidermis, mesoglea (usually well-developed in
subumbrella), and gastrodermis (Laverack and Dando, 1987; Thomas
and Edwards, 1991). The tentacular epidermis contains nematocysts,
complex organelles each of which contains a shaft and an inverted,
spined tube coiled within a capsule (Westfall, 1970; Harrison and
Westfall, 1991), and interstitial cells that give rise to these stinging
cells (Marshall and Williams, 1971). Different species of cnidarians
have up to 7 types of nematocysts, which affect the prey type
captured. A nematocyst is only used once (Marsical, 1974; Barnes,
1987). Several types of nematocysts have been classified and
