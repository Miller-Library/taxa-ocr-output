Abstract
Salt tolerance and acclimation ability of two seashore lichens, Lecanora
pinguis and Niebla homalea, were examined to determine to what extent they are
actually marine adapted. Photosynthetic rate was used as an indicator of the
lichens' response to different conditions. Tolerance was tested by soaking
samples in distilled and various salt water concentrations for various lengths
of time, and acclimation ability was determined by giving preliminary treat¬
ments of distilled or salt water and then observing their effects on responses
to later treatments. L. pinguis was found to be more tolerant of salt water
than N. homalea, but N. homalea showed ability to acclimate to either marine
or terrestrial conditions, while L. pinguis could not adapt to terrestrial
conditions. Thus, L. pinguis is a true marine lichen, while N. homalea is more
accurately described as a salt-tolerant terrestrial lichen. Typical photo¬
sythetic rates for this study were 150 ul.g'ihr-1 for L. pinguis and 75 ul.g ihr
for N. homalea, as measured on a Gilson model IGRP 14 differential respirometer.
