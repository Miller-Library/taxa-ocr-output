-5-
and .065 M NaHCO, designed to keep C0 concentration constant
without affecting photosynthesis rates (Pratt, 1943).
The samples were run at 15°0 for alternating hour-long periods
of dark, light (290 uE.mfs-1), dark, and gas volume changes were
read at the end of each period. Following the three hour period,
the samples were oven dried at 100°0 and then weighed to give
absolute gas evolution rates.
The major difference in procedures came at step A of Fig. 1
in the acclimation experiment. Here samples of each species re¬
ceived twice daily treatments of either distilled or 2.5 X sea¬
water concentration, or were left untouched. These samples were
kept in a box outdoors so they would experience normal light,
temperature, and humidity cycles. Each spray treatment involved
three squirts from a spray bottle delivering 0.5 ml per squirt.
The tolerance test samples were kept indooors during the soaking
periods, but experienced normal light cycles through a large win-
dow.
Results
Lecanora pinguis showed 234.4 ul-gihr-1 for its highest
photosynthetic oxygen production rate (Fig. 2) in 2 X seawater
concentration. Intermediate concentrations of salt water in
general elicited higher rates than any other concentrations or
distilled water. By 144 hours, distilled water had greatly de-
pressed photosynthetic rates, while the salt water treatments
failed to reduce rates after the 72 hour mark. 10 X seawater
concentration (Fig. 2) depressed rates to a constant level by
