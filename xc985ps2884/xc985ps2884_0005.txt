-6-
the 24 hour point.
On the other hand, in distilled water, Niebla homalea (Fig.
3) showed 90.2 ul.g:hr-l as its highest photosynthetic oxygen
evolution rate. Rates in distilled water were consistently equal
to or higher than those of samples treated with any concentration
of seawater. Concentrations of 5 X seawater or greater were photo-
synthetically limiting by the end of 24 hours soaking, while treat-
ment for 144 hours or more in any solution (distilled or salt
water) depressed rates to levels that remained constant through
264 hours.
Niebla homalea displayed ability to acclimate (Fig. 4) to
different water conditions, showing highest rates of photosynthe-
sis after experiencing a certain condition when previously exposed
to that condition. Lecanora pinguis, on the other hand, showed no
ability to acclimate to any specific condition.
Despite large standard deviations, rates of photosynthesis
(Fig. 4) from samples subjected to different treatments in the ac-
climation experiment substantiated the results of the tolerance
tests. Niebla homalea showed highest rates following a distilled
water treatment, while Lecanora pinguis produced the most oxygen
after a salt water treatment. Soak treatments in general elevated
photosynthetic rates over those of dry samples, except for L. pin-
guis soaked in distilled water. N. homalea samples from the con-
trol and field groups photosynthesized at much higher rates rela-
tive to soaked samples than did L. pinguis samples.
Discussion
The above results suggest that Lecanor
pinguis fulfills the
