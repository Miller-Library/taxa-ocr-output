Eigure 1: Procedural flow chart of methods used for acclimation
and tolerance tests. Concentrations are times normal seawater
(33 ppt).
Figure 2: Photosynthetic response of Lecanora pinguis as a per-
centage of the highest rate (234.4 ul-g:hr-1) in response to
various salt and distilled water conditions. Bars represent
% confidence intervals. N-6-9. Bars over c and fare cont. & fiel
Figure 3: Photosynthetic response of Niebla homalea to various
salt and distilled water conditions as a percentage of the high-
est measured rate (90.2 ul.grihr-4). Bars represent 95% confidence
intervals. N=6-9. Bars over c and f are control and field.
Figure 4: Photosynthetic response of Niebla homalea and Lecanora
pinguis to various distilled and salt water conditions following
a two week acclimation period. All figures are percents of the
highest rate for each sample's own species (64.8 and 402.1 ul.gihr
for N. homalea and L. pinguis, respectively). Bars represent 95%
confidence intervals. N=4.
Figure 5: Oven-dry weight as percentage of fresh weight plotted
against concentrations of soaking solutions. Soaking was for
24 hours. Bars represent standard deviations.
