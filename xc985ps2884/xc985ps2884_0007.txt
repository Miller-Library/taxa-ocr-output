day of soaking followed by a one hour dry-out.
The experiments were designed to eliminate as much variabil-
ity as possible. In the tolerance tests, the control group was
used to test the effects of room temperature and light levels as
compared to field conditions. The unsprayed control of the accliÂ¬
mation tests was used to determine the effects of removal from
rocks and seashore conditions. In both cases, controls and field
samples showed no significant differences in photosynthetic rates.
The one hour drying periods on paper towels following soak
treatments were to allow thallus hydration to decrease somewhat
from saturation and bring percent water content to comparable
levels in all samples of a species. Also, it was assumed that any
rehydration respiration in field and control samples was stabilized
by the end of this period, making the average of the respiration
rates for the two dark periods in the respirometer approximately
correct for the light period, when photosynthesis was measured.
Studies done with Peltigera polydactyla (Neck.) Hoffm. found re-
wetting respiration after a one hour drying period to be approxi-
mately linear when plotted against time (Smith and Molesworth
(1972)).
All oxygen production figures have been corrected for temper-
ature and air pressure to give absolute values. Also, a correc-
tion factor to counterbalance added weight from salt deposition
was employed. Salt deposition increased linearly with solution
concentration for both species (Fig. 5). The concentrations of
the soaking and spraying solutions were kept within 5% of listed
values throughout the experimental period.
