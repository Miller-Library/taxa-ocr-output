Materials and Methods
The experimental procedure was in two parts (refer to Fig. 1).
one designéd to test the salt tolerance of the two species and
the other to acclimate the species to different conditions. Six
to nine samples of each lichen for the tolerance test and four
samples for the acclimation ewperiment were collected in the morn-
ings when high natural water content of the thallus allowed easy
removal from the rocks. Squirts of distilled water were used to
raise the thallus water content of L. pinguis when field control
samples were collected in the afternoons and evenings. Care was
taken to choose samples with as little rock and sand imbedded as
possible.
As shown in the flow chart (fig. 1), the procedures for the
tolerance and acclimation studies were very similar. At step B
on the flow chart, the samples were soaked in different concentra¬
tions of artificial seawater, for 16 hours in the acclimation tests
and for periods of 24, 72, 144, and 264 hours in the tolerance tests.
Normal seawater concentration was set at 33 parts per thousand, and
all other concentations were based on this figure, which is an
average for Monterey Bay. The salt solutions were changed after the
samples were removed at 72 and 144 hours in the tolerance tests. In
both experiments, dry control and field samples were submerged for
one minute in distilled water and then air dried on a paper towel
for one hour before being measured for oxygen production in a
Gilson model IGRP 14 differential respirometer. All respirometer
chambers contained a bicarbonate buffer mixture of .035 M KHCO-
