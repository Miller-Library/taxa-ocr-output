Introduction
Maritime or supralittoral lichens form communities close to
the sea, but salt tolerance of specific lichens has not been ex¬
amined. Perry and Sheard (1969) postulate that some maritime
lichens need regular washing with salt water. Other workers
(Fletcher (1973) and Hawksworth (1980)), for example, have arranged
lichens in various zones depending on their tolerance (halophilic)
or intolerance (halophobic) to salt. Distribution of species rela-
tive to exposure (Ballatine (1961)) or frequency of submersion
or spray (Weddell (1875)) has also been examined. Competion be¬
tween other organisms and lichens may also be important in deter-
mining their occurrence on seashore rocks.
A true marine lichen is defined here as one that can tolerate
life on the seashore and prefers to live there, being unable to
acclimate completely to another environment. Fischer-Piette and
Davy de Virville (1931) demonstrated that Caloplaca marina Wedd.,
occurring on seashore rocks, was not found on nearby estuary shores
with similar available substrates. The primary difference between
the two sites was the amount of exposure to salt spray of the ocean.
This investigation is designed to determine the effects of
various salt conditions on two other common supralittoral lichens.

Samples were treated in distilled water, approximating rain which
is periodic (November through April) in this region, and were
soaked in various concentrations of seawater, approximating that
salt exposure to salt spray that is rapidly evaporated and there-
fore leaves very concentrated salt. Photosynthetic rate was the
