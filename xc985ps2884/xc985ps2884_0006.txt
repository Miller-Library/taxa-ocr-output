two criteria of a marine lichen, namely tolerance to salt and
inability to acclimate to less marine conditions, while Niebla
homalea only meets one, that of salt tolerance. Thus, L. pinguis
appears well adapted for life in the supralittoral zone, while
N. homalea fits well in the seashore terrestrial region, having
characteristics of both halophilic and halophobic lichens (Flet-
cher (1973)).
Remarkable in itself is the fact that the algal component of
both lichens managed to survive even the harshest conditions and
produce a photosynthetic rate at least one-quarter of the average
field sample rate. Heat-killed and salt-soaked samples showed
plasmolyzed algae and zero photosynthetic rates, while the experi-
mental algae were normal in appearance. The lichen thallus as a
whole often appeared duller in color following prolonged soaking,
Further salt tolerance studies on terrestrial lichens would clear
up the question of whether the survival of Niebla homalea for 264
hours in 10 X seawater concentration is evidence of some marine
adaptation, or another example of the extreme hardiness of lichens
in general.
Both species showed higher photosynthesis rates when the
thallus percent water content was higher owing to long soaking
period. This result was surprising, for Lange (1980) found that
Ramalina maciformis (Del.) Bory had photosynthetic rates approxi-
mately equal at thallus percent water contents of 60 and 85. This
difference could possibly be due to the difference in soaking dura-
tions. 60% water content was reached by the field and control
samples, which were soaked for only one minute before the hour dry-
ing period, while the 85% water content was the result of a full
