Variability was considerable in this study, and if it were
to be repeated, certain methods could be changed to get more con¬
stant response values. Using only part of the thallus rather than
the whole plant would reduce any error introduced by the differences
in size or number of apothecia or other structures. Age of the
plants may be hard to estimate, but if it were possible, that fac-
tor, along with orientation in the field of samples gathered for
study, could be standardized, probably also resulting in less
variation. Finally, use of respiration rates as an indication of
stress or acclimation might provide more standard responses.
Photosynthesis was used as the indicator in this study because
of its higher rates, which make measurement easier.
A certain amount of variability is inherent in lichen photo-
synthesis rates, and the variability of photosynthesis rates in
this study seemed to follow certain trends as a function of soak-
ing solution concentration and regardless of soaking period length
throughout the tolerance experiment. Greatest variability in
rates for Niebla homalea were seen in lowest and highest concen-
trations of seawater, with less variability at the intermediate
concentrations. Lecanora pinguis, on the other hand, showed great-
est variability for one day soaking in distilled water and seawater
concentration, with all remaining concentrations and soaking dura-
tions having approximately the same variability.
