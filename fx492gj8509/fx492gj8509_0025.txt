fig. 7. Contraction types. (a) Illustrations of 4 contraction
types with emphasis on the role of the siphons.
(b) Sample of strain gauge data. A - cross-atrial
contraction which is followed by fecal pellet
ejection. B - Both siphons contracting. O - crossÂ¬
-oral contraction. R - relaxed resting state.
