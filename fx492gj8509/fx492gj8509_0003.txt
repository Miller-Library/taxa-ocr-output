Speculation on the significance of spontaneous
squirting has ranged widely. Suggestions have included,
mixing of water adjacent to oral siphon (Jorgensen 1966),
cleaning of brachial wall of accumulated sediment, gamete
release, fecal pellet ejection (Goodbody 1974), food
particle sorting (MacGinitie 1939), and a suggestion
that there is an ancestral tie to the pulsations of the
salps (Hecht 1916).
The rythmic contractions of ascidians has been
reported in many species but variation and regulation
of spontaneous contractions has been sparsly studied.
Yamaguchi (1931) and Hoyle (1953) are in agreement that
starvation causes the spontaneous contraction rattee to
increase. Shumway (1978) observed that Ciona intestinalis
has a rate of 14 contractions h at 10°0 and that contraction
rate decreased as external salinity decreased. Many
aspects of environmental regulation of spontaneous
contraction rate have never been studied.
The characteristics of contractions in ascidians
have only been briefly touched upon by previous investi¬
-gators. Yamaguchi (1931) has the only detailed descrip¬
-tion of more then one distinct spontaneous contraction:
type. In Styela clava he observed and described several
varieties of spontaneous contractions but he made no
effort to suggest the functional purpose of contraction
varieties.
