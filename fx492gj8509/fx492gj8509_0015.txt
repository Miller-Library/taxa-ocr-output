in animals in stagnant (filtered water at room temp.)
and fresh seawater. (fig. 5) The animal maintained a
contraction rate of 30 contractions h'+ 3 until the
circulated ambient seawater brought the contraction rate
down to 11 contraction h. One or more factors involved in
stagnation conditions increased contrastion rate.
Temperature turned out to be a contraction modulating
factor. (fig. 6) As ambient temperature rises Ciona
intestinalis contracts more rapidly and vigorously.
Confirmation of the reversibility of this effect is
demonstrated by decrease in the contraction rate as
temperature drops back to 19'0. Marina, video, and strain
gauge data fits into the bottom of the temperature correÂ¬
-lation.
During observations of contraction rates it became
clear that 3 isolated contraction types occur in Ciona
intestinalis. By carefully hooking up a strain gauge
to an especially active animal it is possible to get a
record of the different kinds of contractions which can
be read like an electrocardiogram. Spike shape is
characteristic of contracton type. (fig 7)
Contraction types included:
1. Both - siphons narrow to small openings and the
circular muscles in the upper third of the body tighten
to force water out both siphons.
