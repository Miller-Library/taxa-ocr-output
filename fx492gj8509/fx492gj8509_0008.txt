the strain gauge via a small alligator clip 1 cm below
the oral siphon. Contraction of an animal was converted
into an analog signal which was recorded on a polygraph
with adjustable time base. (fig. 2) After the animals
were allowed to adjust to the clips they appeared to
contract normally.
4. Direct observations of contracting rows of Ciona
intestinalis allowed more careful observation of contraction
types.
The first experiment done involved measuring contraction
rates for animals in stagnated and circulating water.
The
animals were hooked to the strain gauge and allowed to
sit for 8 h. in a.3.8.1 tank of filtered seawater at
18°0. After 8 h. contraction measurements were started.
Stagnation conditions involved higher temperature, lack
of food, increase in metabolic wastes, and small changes in
oxygen tension. After 5 h. circulation indicates the
addition of 14 C water with food present. After 1 h. the
temperature of the tank changed from 18 C to 14 C.
Temperature variation represents one of the factors
of stagnation so experiments involving temperature change
were done. An array of 12 animals were hung in a 75.7 1
aquarium and observed for 6 h. The water in the tank was
aerated and stirred but unrenewed. Between each one hour
observation an aquarium heater brought the temperature up
2°0 over a 1 h. period. Aeration of the water was provided
