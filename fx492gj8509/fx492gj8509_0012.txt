RESULTS:
Contraction rates vary widely between individuals
and in the same individual over time. In marina observations
some animals contracted 1 time h" and others contracted
20 times. The temperature of the marina ranged between
15-15.5 0. The dissolved oxygen content of the water
was 9.5ppm. The average Ciona intestinalis contraction
rate in the marina is 6.3 contractions h with a standard
deviation of 6.0. Observations at the marina revealled the
sensitivity of Ciona intestinalis to passing pedestrians.
The animals responded to vibration by quick closure of
both siphons with no body contractions. Subsequent
observations were made at off hours and laboratory
observations were conducted in an undisturbed basement
aquarium room.
The first environmental factor analysed was the
amount of dissolved oxygen in the seawater surrounding
the ascidian. Temperature ranged from 15-15.5Â°0. When
oxygen tension dropped from ambient (9.5ppm) down to 5. 5ppm.
fig. 3 shows that contraction rate varies only slightly.
Strain gauge measurements done at temperatures of
13 0  10 produced contraction rates that were very
close to those obtained at the Monterey marina and on
video observation. (fig. 4)
The first modulation of contraction rate was observed
