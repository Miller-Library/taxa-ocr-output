CAPTIONS FOR FIGURES:
fig. 1. Apparatus used for video observation of contracting
Ciona intestinalis
fig. 2. Strain gauge and polygraph set up for long term
measurement of contraction rate in Ciona intestinalis.
fig. 3. Average contraction rates, and standard deviations
(sd) of contraction rates for Ciona intestinalis.
fig. 4.
train gauge observations of average contraction
rate for normally contracting Ciona intestinalis
in a small temperature range (13°0 +1 °0).
Stagnation observation. Changes in average
fig.
contraction rate with exposure to stagnation
(filtered water, 18 C, lack of food, and build up
of metabolic waste) and circulation (14 0, moving
water, food, no build up of wastes).
Temperature observations. Changes in average
fig.6.
contraction rate with changes in temperature.
(Dotted line) strain gauge measurements. (Solid
line) direct observation. (Square) reversal of
temperature back to 19°0 for last direct observation.
(Rectangle) marina observations. (Triangles)
train gauge measurements at 3 temperatures.
