ABSTRACT:
Specimens of Ciona intestinalis were observed in
the lab and in their natural habitat for evidence of
spontaneous contractions. In the laboratory oxygen
tension and temperature were varied to induce spontaneous
contraction modulation. It was found that Ciona intestinalis
contracts at an average rate of 6.3 times h' at 15-15.50
in nature. Intermediate levels of oxygen tension have
no effect on contraction rate but increasing temperature
increases contraction rate. 3 contraction types can
be isolated in Ciona intestinalis (cross-oral, cross-atrial,
and both siphons). At higher contraction rates more
cross-oral and fewer "both" contractions occur. Observations
at high contraction rates indicate that contraction
durations occur between 10-15 sec with little variation.
