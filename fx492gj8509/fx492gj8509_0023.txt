SUMMARY:
1. Ciona intestinalis contracts rhythmically in nature
at an average rate of 6.3 contraction h'.
2. Between animals contraction rates are highly
variable.
3. Intermediate values of oxygen tension have no effect
on contraction rate.
4. Raising temperature causes the average contraction
rate of Ciona intestinalis to increase
5. The duration of contractions stays constant over
long periods of time.
6. 3 seperate contraction types can be observed in Ciona
intestinalis.
7. The ratio of these 3 contraction types changes with
contraction rate.
