Discussion;
No thorough studies have been done on the environmental
modulation of spontaneous contractions in solitary ascidians.
Regulation of contraction rate has been observed with
starvation (Hoyle 1953 and Yamaguchi 1931) and salinity
fluctuations (Shumway 1978) but no mention of temperature
modulation has been made. The only mention of the temperature
effect is (Polimanti 1911) who noticed high rates of
contraction at 30°0 but made no observations under normal
conditions. This study has shown that temperature increases
contraction rate with a 0 of about 6 over the temperature
range of 15 to 25°0. This is a dramatic temperature
response and certainly warrants further investigation,
especially seasonal and acclimation aspects.
My values for average normal contraction rate clustered
around 3-8 contractions h" at 13P0.+1. "This is much
sower then previously published values of 14 contractions
h" at the lower temperature of 10°0 (Shumway 1978). The
close correlation between video, marina, and strain gauge
observations provides confidence that animals in the
laboratory were contracting in a way similar to their
natural behavior.
Suggestions that particle sorting may be a result
of spontaneous contractions (MacGintie 1939) are unlikely
considering the marina observations. The Monterey marina
has water containing high amounts of plankton and suspended
