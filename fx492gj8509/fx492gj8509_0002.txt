INTRODUCTION:
The behavioral repertoire of solitary ascidians
is rather limited. They are benthic filter feeders;
clearing pariticles of organic matter from water pumped
through their brachial basket by beating cilia. This
feeding current is occaisonally interrupted by behavioral
events known as spontaneous contractions. Spontaneous
contractions differ from induced contractions in that
they occur without a visible external trigger. Hecht
(1918) presented the first detailed description of
spontaneous contractions in Ascidia nigra. However,
after many years of investigation the purpose of sponÂ¬
-taneous squirting in ascidians is still a matter of
controversy.
Hoyle (1953) did extensive studies on spontaneous
contractions in which he calculated high rates of water
intake due to muscular contraction. He proposed that
spontaneous contractions represent a supplementary feeding
mechanism. However, later measures of ciliary water
flow (Jorgensen 1966 and Carlisle 1966) showed that water
flow due to ciliary activity is actually 30 times greater
then muscular water renewal. These new current calculations,
coupled with the observation that contractions eject
good unfiltered water and suck in equally good water,
reopened the spontaneous contraction controversy.
