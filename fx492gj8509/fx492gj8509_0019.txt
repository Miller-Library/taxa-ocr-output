Observation of contraction types show that cross-atrial
contractions are associated with gamete and fecal removal
from the atrial cavity. Often a series of several crossÂ¬
-atrial contractions preceeds ejection of waste or sexual
products. Manual insertion of large particles into the
oral-siphon of Ciona intestinalis will evoke cross- oral
behavior but in regular spontaneous contraction sequences
particles were not observed to be discharged from cross-
-oral contractions.
Measurements of contraction types in stagnant and
circulating water were done on 2 animals under stagnation
conditions and 14 animals in circulating ambient water.
Calculations indicate that at high contraction rates
more cross-oral contractions occur and fewer contractions
of both siphons. The frequency of cross-atrial contractions
stays about the same.
Observations of Ciona intestinalis embryos were
made on freghly settled animals. In the observation of
7 embryos the start of spontaneous contractions was
correlated with the start of ciliary action on the developing
igmata. At 5 days Ciona embryos contract every-2 min.
At this early stage embryos are insensitive to vibration.
As embryos grow older (10 days) they become more sensitive
to vibrations and their contraction rate decreases to
every 5 min.
