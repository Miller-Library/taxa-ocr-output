METHODS AND MATERIALS:
The ascidian Ciona intestinalis was chosen as the
subject for all contraction experiments because of its
size and easily observable contraction behavior. The
animals were collected from the fouling community that
hangs down from the underside of the floating docks in
the Monterey marina.
Spontaneous contractions were observed in four
different ways.
1. Direct observations were made of the contraction
frequencies of Ciona intestinalis hanging from the dock.
24 clearly observable animals were watched for 1 h. each.
2. Animals were collected from the marina and placed
in laboratory aquariums supplied with circulating seawater
at 12-140. The animals are normally attatched upside
down to the bottom of the docks. To provide support and
natural orientation the animals were clipped at the viseral
end and hung upside down in an aquarium. Strings of
contracting Ciona intestinalis were then observed using
a color videotape set up. (fig. 1) This allowed easy
observation of large numbers of animals at once and the
ability to replay contractions the observer missed. 12
animals were observed for 4 h and 6 more animals were
observed for 1 h.
3. For longer term observation the animals were attatched
to strain gauges. Ciona intestinalis was connected to
