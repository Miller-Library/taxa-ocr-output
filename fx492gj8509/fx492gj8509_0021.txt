organic particles yet this doesn't effect contraction
rate.
Yamaguchi (1931), like this author described crossÂ¬
oral, cross-atrial, and simultaneous closure of both
siphons as 3 isolated contraction types. He was able
to determine that in Styela clava each siphon has its
own pacemaker activity. Isolated siphons contract at
rates which are different from intact animals. Further
experiments may show that Ciona intestinalis has a similar
intrinsic siphonic rate. The different contraction types
could be postulated to be an integration of different
pacemaker regions.
Based on my observations it appears that regular
spontaneous contractions are an integration of 2 rhythms.
First, the cross-atrial contractions are tied to waste
and sexual release. The other contractions are a reaction
to environmental changes. Ciona intestinalis is sampling
it's environment continuously. As a benthic organism
it has only one escape from unpleasant enveronmental change.
Ciona intestinalis contracts away from or blows away any of
the environment it finds noxious. Environments with high
salinity, high temperature or no food produce a high
maintained rate of contraction as long as the irritation
persists. Spontaneous contractions are not strictly
spontaneous but result from environmental stimulation
rather than the more obvious mechanical stimulation.
