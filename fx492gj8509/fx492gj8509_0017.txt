2. Cross Atrial - oral siphon closes and contraction
of circular muscles causes ejection of water out the atrial
siphon.
3. Cross Oral (opposite of cross atrial ) - atrial
siphon closes and contraction of circular muscles cause
ejection of water out the atrial siphon.
Often the cross-atrial of cross-oral contraction
is followed by closure of both siphons for a short time.
The cross-atrial and cross-oral reaction causes a stronger jet
of water then the constriction of both siphons.
Some Ciona intestinalis contract more vigorously
then others. However, the duration of a spontaneous
contraction often stays constant over long periods. On
strain gauge measurements over 2 h time periods animals
were observed to contract for an average of 11.5 sec.
with a standard deviation of 1.7 sec regardless of
contraction variety. Circular muscle constriction is
a major part of speontaneous contraction behavior but
seldom is notable shortening of longitudinal muscle fibers
involved. The maximum contraction rate for Ciona intestinalis
under temperatures of 25 C is 90-95 contractions h*!.
This contraction rate was obtained as the upper range
in the temperature modulation experiment. At high
temperatures Ciona intestinalis will often contract
rapidly for a period of time then contract without subsequent
relaxation.
