My investigation is aimed at pinpointing more environmental
factors which modulate spontaneous contraction behavior.
Few measurements of naturally contracting ascidians have
been made. Little is known about contraction characteristics.
By recording natural contraction rates then observing
contractions under varying environmental conditions it
may become clearer what the purpose of spontaneous behavior
is in tunicates.
