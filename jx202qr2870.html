A Survey of the Effects of the Pacific Grove Semage Outfall
on the Surrounding Intertidal Region.
by Charles Mitter
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University
I. Introduction
Pacific Grove, California, discharges its sewage after primary
treatment from an oceen outfall,located on a narrow spit within the
boundaries of the Point Pinos Lighthouse Reservation, a marine life
preserve. The end of the pipe is about 500 feet from the base of the
point and lies two feet below mean sea level in a rocky intertidal area,
fifteen feet from shore. (see fig. 1). The region receives heavy surf.
The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of
this outfall on the adjacent shore areas as measured by the distribu-
tions, with respect to the point of discharge, of common intertidal
organisms, and to relate these results to local currents and to other
parameters of pollution, including plots of phosphate concentration,
dissolved oxygen levels, and coliform bacteria counts.
According to a study done for the Gity Council by Engineering Sei-
ence, Inc., flow volume of this waste, which is almost wholly of domes-
tic origin, averages about 1.8 million gallons per day (mgd) during dry
weather, and about 4.5 mgd during periods of prolonged rainfall. During
heavy winter storms, because of seepage into the pipe system, flow may

sludge. During this year, the City Council is making plans to move the
present outfall, built in 1952, out about 500 yards into much deeper wa-
ter; this construction, if the recommendations of Engineering Science are
followed, would be concurrent with a general program of improvement in the
city's treatment facilities, to include repair of the existing lines to re-
duce infiltration, and trucking of sludge to drying beds.
I would like to express appreciation to the City Manager and
ouncil of Pacific Grove for their kindly view of and help with this.stud
and for their dedication to the continuing improvement of the city's
sewage disposal practices. Also I would like to thank Nr. Colburn oi

ffluent Dilution
Thosphate, a basic raw material needed by plants for the synthesis of
certain organic compounds, is often found in high concentrations in sewage;
the phosphate level in Pacific Grove's effluent is roughly 100 times that of
the receiving seawter. Nowever, because this ion is not ordinarily a limi-
ing growth factor in the ocean, this large excess does not tend to be ta-
gen up by living organisms. These facts, combined with the sensitivity of
the method of detection, make phosphate concentration a reasonable mea-
sure of effluent dilution.
Determinations were made of the phosphate content of the
ying distances from the outfall, using the method described by Stricklan
and Parsons. The results are shown in figure 3. The pattern apparent i-
generally that which might be predicted from the current studies discussed
above when these are combined with a knowledge of tide and effluent flow co
ditions at the time of sampling. The highest concentrations are found in
those areas where water carrying effluent tends to sit. To the west and
along the north side of the point (except when there is flow across chan-

Coliform bacteria counts
Coliform bacteria, which occur in the human intestine, are widely use
as an indicator of sewage pollution; where they are encountered there is alsc
the possibility of disease organisms being present.
Counts were taken on two dates during the study period, following the
procedure in Standard Methods of Waste and Water Analysis. Three primary
fermentation tubes at each of three dilutions were used, and a cowfirmed tes
as made using eosin methylene blue agar. The results are presented in fig-
ure 4. In general, these correspond well to the current and dilution patterns
discussed above, with the exception that an occasional high court may be found
at some distance away (see samples 3 and 11 in figure 4.). As these were al-
ways in shallow, protected areas, it would seem that bacteria (not necessaril.
from the effluent) sometimes happen into a pocket providing especially favorable
growth conditions, giving counts that do not reflect the actual level of ef-
fluent dilution (but perhaps significant frow the standpoint of public health).
Dissolved oxyger
Wicro-organisms tend to attack and break down at a high rate the ergan
tter discharged in sewage, using up in the process large quantities of
ogygen, which is vital to larger plants and animals. Thus, oxygen depletior
can be a mearure of sewage pollution.
Dissolved oxygen determinations were done concurrently with the coli-
form counts, using the standard Winkler titration method. The results are

Physical Description of Area
The area consists of 3 distinct sections-
(a) a flat shelf above the cliff of a-
area 1, receiving only heavy splash at
high tide; (b) a gently sloping rock
channel back of area 5, most of which
is awash only at high high tides. Con-
tains one large, landlocked tidepool;
(c) a very irregular rocky shelf re-
ceiving heavy surf, offering however
many different degrees of protection
from wave shock. Contains several
large tidepools. Water washing in as
tide begins to rise is brown and murky.
facing page.
General Remarks
Although this area is not as obvi-
ously "sick" as those closer to
the outfall, containing very many
of the most common species, it
could not be called unpolluted.
Some very familiar forms are
scarce or missing (such as the Ca-
lifornia mussel and the red alga
Endocladia), while others are
far more abundant here than might
be expected. (Examples being the
goose barnacle and the chiton Nut-
tällina.). As in other areas, middle
zone algae are scarce and tend to as-
sume highly atypical forms.

mid level, especially in shaded cracks.

Corallina sp. (coralline alga) - very common on rocks at lower
middle and lowest levels.
