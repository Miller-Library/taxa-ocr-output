Lipid and Glycogen Content
mined at this point. The levels of glycogen and lipid in these
worms corresponded to levels reported in other polychaetes.
Cirriformia luxuriosa seems to be relying on glycogen
and some other reserve material, possibly protein, to survive
periods of starvation. During the two week period the glycogen
content of the worms decreased, implying the metabolism of
this energy reserve. The upper limit of the ranges also
consistently decreased over the course of starvation while the
lower limit remained constant. This indicates a basic body
level of glycogen which may not be metabolised. As the worms
starve, they seem to use up their glycogen to the point where
it comprises.019% of wet body weight.
The lipid content as a percentage of body weight appear¬
ed to increase over the period of two weeks. This can be
explained in one of two ways. Either the annelid has syn¬
thesised lipids or has used some other reserve to a greater
extent than lipids. The latter hypothesis seems the more
likely. Unless there is a decrease in metabolic rate during
starvation, something other than glycogen must be the substrate
of this metabolism because the decrease in glycogen over the
two week period is small, 120 micrograms/gram of worm.
In Myxicola infundibulum there was no significant
change in glycogen during the period of starvation. However,
there did seem to be a lower limit to glycogen content here
as in Cirriformia luxuriosa. Myxicola infundibulum did show
a significant decrease in lipid levels over the two week period.
This decrease of .44% of body weight in lipid content is
