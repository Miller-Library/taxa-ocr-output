Lipid and Glycogen Content
attributed to lipid utilisation by the worm. Thus, it appears
that this worm does not appreciably utilise glycogen at the
onset of starvation, but instead metabolises its lipids for
energy.
It seems that these polychaetes do not rely solely
on glycogen as an energy reserve. One species, Cirriformia
luxuriosa, seems to call upon proteins or some other reserve
to make up for an energy deficit during early starvation.
Another polychaete, Myxicola infundibulum, seems to rely upon
lipid stores at the onset of starvation. This is entirely
consistent with the previous observations of Dales (1957a),
Towle and Giese (1966), and Wilbur (1947).
