Lipid and Glycogen Content
INTRODUCTION
Work done on lipid and glycogen metabolism in poly¬
chaetes is scarce. However, Giese (1966) reports many studies
on other invertebrates. Table 1 presents the results of studies
on glycogen and lipid contents of various polychaetes. Changes
in the glycogen and lipid of several annelids and the sipunculids
Phascolosoma agassizii and Phascolosoma gouldii have been in-
vestigated.
Terebella lepidara showed a marked decrease in body
wall lipid content after ten days of starvation. Arenicola
marina showed a body wall lipid content increase after six
weeks of starvation and a four fold increase in the gut lipids
during the same period. Dales (1957a)
Von Brand (1927) studied glycogen contents in polychaetes
and concluded that the substance in the worms he studied is
used in times of oxygen stress. Scheer (1969) reports on
conversion of glycogen to lactic acid under anaerobic conditions
in oligochaetes.
Dales (1958) found that Arenicola marina uses its
glycogen stores during anaerobiosis, while Owenia fusiformis,
which has a lower glycogen content, does not show an appreciable
depletion of glycogen reserves. Instead, Dales suspects a
reduction in metabolic rate. No evidence of lactic or pyruvic
acid was found.
Towle and Giese (1966) measured the effect of starvation
on Phascolosoma agassizii. The original carbohydrate level of
4.1% and glycogen of .8% (dry weight) did not appreciably de¬
