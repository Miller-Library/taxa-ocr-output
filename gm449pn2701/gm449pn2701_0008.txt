Lipid and Glycogen Conter
Schneider
SUMMARY
1.
Lipid and glycogen content determinations were done
on Myxicola infundibulum, Cirriformia luxuriosa,
Halosydna brevisetosa, and Phragmatopoma californica
collected from the Monterey Bay area of central California.
Myxicola infundibulum and Cirriformia luxuriosa
were starved for two weeks and their lipid and
glycogen contents assayed.
Myxicola infundibulum appears to rely on stored lipids
at the onset of starvation.
Cirriformia luxuriosa appears to use some other
reserve at the onset of starvation.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Dr. John Phillips for his
invaluable help and encouragement during the course of this
project.
