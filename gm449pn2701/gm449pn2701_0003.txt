Lipid and Glycogen Content
eel grass Phyllospadix. The worms were either analysed fresh
from the field or deprived of food as follows. M. infundibulum
and C. luxuriosa were placed in a plastic pan supplied with
running, glass fiber filtered sea water at 12.0-13.5° C.
Sixteen worms were analysed immediately or after one
and two weeks of starvation. Each of sixteen worms of each
species was homogenised in 1 ml of distilled water per wet
weight gram of worm except for P. californica. Sixteen samples
of five to eight P. californica were substituted because of
their small size. Lipids were first extracted using three
ten ml portions of a 50:50, volume to volume, mixture of
95% ethyl alcohol and diethyl ether. The insoluble material
was removed by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The
ethanol-ether was poured into a beaker, evaporated to dryness,
and re-extracted with two five ml portions of chloroform.
The chloroform was then poured into a pre-weighed pan and evap¬
orated to dryness.
The material insoluble in ethanol-ether was then assayed
for glycogen by the method of Somogyi (1934). Two ml of 50%
sodium hydroxide were added for each gram of original tissue
and digested for three hours at 100° C. After digestion the
alkaline mixture was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm.
The clear alkaline fluid was decanted and the remaining matter
was washed with two ml of distilled water for each gram of
tissue, shaken, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm.
This fluid was then united with the first and one ml of 95%
ethanol added for each two ml of fluid. The glycogen was
allowed to precipitate overnight.
