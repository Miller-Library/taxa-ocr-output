Lipid and Glycogen Content
value was 2.69% + .47. This increase is significant at p less
than .007. After two weeks the lipid content ranged from 2.1%
to 3.1% with a mean of 2.56% +.36. This was also significantly
higher than at O time with p less than.013 but not significantly
different from the value at one week.
For M. infundibulum, the glycogen was found to range
from .021% to .069% of wet body weight. The mean was found to
be .043% + .015. One week of starvation produced a range of
.014% to .064% glycogen with a mean of .034% +.021; see Figure
3. Two weeks of starvation showed the worm's glycogen to
range from .014% to .079% and the mean being .037% +.020.
None of these values showed any statistically significant
change over the two week period.
The lipids of M. infundibulum initially ranged from
2.5% to 3.8% with a mean of 3.28% +.41. One week later the
lipids comprised from 2.3% to 4.4% of body weight, the mean
being 3.22% + .67; see Figure 4. After two weeks without
nourishment, the worms showed lipid contents of from 2.0% to
3.8% with a mean of 2.84% + .53. The decrease in lipid content
in M. infundibulum is significant at p less than.02.
DISCUSSION
The subtidal worms Halosydna brevisetosa and Myxicola
infundibulum both show the two highest lipid contents and the
two lowest glycogen levels. The intertidal worms, Phragmatopoma
californica and Cirriformia luxuriosa show lower lipid contents
and slightly higher glycogen contents. Whether this is of
adaptive significance or just coincidence can not be deterÂ¬
