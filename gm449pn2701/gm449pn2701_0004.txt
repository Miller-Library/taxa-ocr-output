Lipid and Giycogen Content
Schneider 4
The next day the carbohydrates were collected by
centrifugation at 2000 rpm for fifteen minutes, the supernatant
poured off, and the pellet washed with 95% ethanol.
Total glycogen was determined colourimetrically by
the phenol-sulphuric acid method of Dubois (1956). Values
obtained were compared with a standard curve prepared with
glucose,
RESULTS
The results of the lipid and glycogen determinations
are given in Table 2 as the mean and standard deviation of the
sixteen samples of worms. In general the levels of these
materials correspond to the values reported for other polychaetes
in Table 1.
The starvation experiments carried out with C. luxÂ¬
uriosa had a range of glycogen contents at time O of .019% to
19%. See Figure 1. The mean was .054% +.042. After one
week the range was from .021% to .11% with a mean of .064% + .026.
After two weeks of starvation the glycogen content ranged
from .020% to .065% with a mean of .042% +.013. The decrease
over the last week was significant at p less than .02 using a
"t" test. The range of values converged on a lower limit in
each case of.019%.
The lipids in C. luxuriosa showed an increase over
two weeks of starvation; see Figure 2. At O time the lipid
content ranged from 1.6% to 2.8% with a mean of 2.24% + .41.
After one week the values ranged from 1.9% to 3.6%. The mean
