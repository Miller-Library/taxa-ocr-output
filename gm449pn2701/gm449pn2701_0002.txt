Lipid and Glycogen Content

crease. Instead, the lipids were metabolised and fell from
4.1% to 3.3% in seventeen days and to 2.7% in seventy-one days.
Wilbur (1947) has done starvation studies on the sip¬
unculid Phascoloma gouldii. After four weeks the lipid content
decreased from 3.86% to .8% but the muscle lipid content in¬
creased from 1.32% to 2.02%, possibly indicating the utilisation
of proteins found there.
The above data posed an interesting question. Some
polychaetes such as Terebella lepidara showed decreases in
lipid contents during starvation while increases in lipid con¬
tents were noted in Arenicola marina. Thus, the metabolism of
lipids during starvation did not seem to follow any general
pattern. Neither did the usage of glycogen during starvation
seem to be a well explored topic. The study reported here
is an investigation of lipid and glycogen content of the
polychaetes, Myxicola infundibulum (Renier 1804), Cirriformia
luxuriosa (Moore 1904), Halosydna brevisetosa (Kinberg 1855),
and Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes 1899), and the effect
of short term starvation on these reserves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All animals were collected from the Monterey area
in central California. M. infundibulum and H. brevisetosa
were collected subtidally at the Monterey marina. P. cali¬
fornica was taken by chiseling a portion of a colony found
past the east end of Aggassiz beach at Hopkins Marine Station.
C. luxuriosa was taken from the mud around the roots of the
