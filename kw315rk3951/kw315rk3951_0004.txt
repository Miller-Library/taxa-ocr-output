The procedure for determining monosaccharide accumulation
in intestinal tissue was a modification of that of Crane and
Mandelstam (1960). The intestine and associated digestive
gland was removed from an experimental animal and placed in
chiton Ringer solution (Lawrence and Lawrence, 1967). The
digestive gland was carefully teased away from the intestine
and the intestine was elongated. The proximal half of the
anterior intestine and the proximal 30 cm of the posterior
intestine were the only portions studied in these experiments.
Fifteen centimeter portions of the experimental tissues
were everted over a glass rod, rinsed in chiton Ringer solu¬
tion, and cut with scissors to yield a number of 2-4 mm
wide tissue rings. These were distributed evenly among
incubation flasks containing 50 ml of chiton Ringer solution,
thus assuring a uniform sample in each flask.
Incubations flasks were given a 15-minute preincubation
period followed by the addition of specific unlabeled and
C-labeled monosaccharides to the medium. Both pre¬
incubation and incubation were carried out at 18°-20°C
on a rotary shaker (60rpm) under 100% oxygen. Concentrations
of sugar in the incubation medium ranged from 0.2-10 mM.
Incubation periods ranged from 0-8 hours.
Following incubation, two tissue samples containing
6-8 intestinal tissue slices were removed from an incubation
flask, blotted lightly, weighed, homogonized in 2.0 ml 2.0%
