Sugar Absorption by C. stelleri
INTRODUCTION
The absorption of nutrients is one important phys¬
iological function of animal intestine. Absorption of
nutrients has been well-studied in vertebrates (for re¬
views, see Wilson, 1962; Crane, 1968; Curran, 1973),
revealing accumulation against an apprent concentration
gradient by means of the carrier-mediated process termed
active transport (for a review of membrane carrier trans¬
port, see Neame and Richards, 1972). Little work has
been done with invertebrates, however.
The study of monosaccharide active transport in in¬
vertebrate intestine has encompassed only two classes of
Echinodermata (see Lawrence and Mailman, 1967; Ferguson, 1964),
one class of Arthropoda (Randal and Derr, 1965), and two
classes of Mollusca (Lawrence and Lawrence, 1967; Wright,
1968). Very little is known about the exact site of mono¬
saccharide absorption in invertebrates, or the nature of
the mechanism by wheih that absorption occurs.
The first investigation demonstrating active transport
of monosaccharides by a molluscan intestine was done by
Lawrence and Lawrence (1967) using the amphineuran Crypto¬
chiton stelleri (Middendorff, 1846). D-glucose and 3-0-
methylglucose were found to be accumulated from the in¬
