FIGURE CAPTIONS
fig. 1. Uptake of D-galactose by posterior intestinal
tissue over an 8-hr incubation period. Initial medium conÂ¬
centration was 3.0 mM. Samples were taken in duplicate at O.
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hrs, and analyzed chemically and
radioactively for D-galactose. Both methods yielded similar
results; radioactive analysis is presented here.
fig. 2. Relationship of the rate of D-galactose uptake to
the concentration of D-galactose in the incubation medium.
Rate of uptake is plotted as the concentration of D-galactose
in posterior intestinal tissue after a 3-hr incubation
period. Radioactive and chemical analysis gave equivalent
results; radioactively-determined data are presented here.
Total transport is divided into a hypothetical insaturable
component and saturable component, attributed to net diffusion
and carrier transport, respectively. On this basis, Vmay
equals 0.81 mM/hr, and K 0.1 mM. Vpay
may actually be
somewhat higher, due to the possible effects of outward
transport which were not considered in analysis.
fig. 3. The uptake of D-glucose by intestinal tissue.
Proximal anterior and proximal posterior intestinal tissue
were incubated for 3 hrs in a 5.5 mM D-glucose medium.
Hourly samples were recovered in duplicate and analyzed by
