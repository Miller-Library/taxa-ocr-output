tissue was not substantially inhibited by high concentrations
of D-glucose support the belief of Lawrence and Lawrence
(1967) that at least two monosaccharide transport systems
are operating in the intestine of this organism.
The velocity of D-galactose accumulation in the
experiment demonstratin saturation of galactose transport
(fig. 2) is represented by the final tissue concentration
after a three-hour incubation period. The experimental
values thus do not directly represent initial rates, as is
desired. However, transport is slow enough that it is
assumed the final concentrations are proportional to initial
rates. Transport analyzed in this way yields a curve which
can be divided hypothetically into a saturable and unÂ¬
saturable component, the linear unsaturable component being
attributed to net diffusion. The value for Vpgy determined
for the saturated D-galactose system, 0.8 mM/hr, may actually
be somewhat lower than the true value due to the effects
of outward transport which were not considered in this
experiment. Nevertheless, even with a two-fold increase
in rate, transport remains extremely slow when compared to
a corresponding mammalian system. The D-galactose transport
system of hamster intestine, for example, has aI
of
max
120 mM/hr (Crane, 1960). The difference in rates is not
unexpected, however, as there are great differences in the
metabolic rates and energy requirements of these two
