Sugar Absorption by C. stelleri
repository similar to the serosal fluid of the everted sac.
A second advantage of the tissue accumulation technique is
that slices from different locations on the intestine and
from different animals can be pooled and distributed among
flasks so that the sugar absorbing potential of the tissues
in each flask is uniform. This is not possible using everted
sacs, as the transport rate of each sac varies. The use of
tissue samples with equivalent absorbing potential is essential
in the study of saturation kinetics, which is an important
means of characterizing any transport mechanism.
The properties of D-glucose, D-galactose, and, in
certain circumstances, 3-0-methylglucose transport were
thus studied using a tissue accumulation technique. The
two regions of intestine studied showed specific accumulation
of one or more of these sugars. Transport was notably slow
compared to sugar absorption by hamster intestinal tissue.
The D-galactose transport system of the proximal posterior
intestine of Cryptochiton stelleri, however, was found to
be more sensitive to low sugar concentrations than the
mammalian equivalent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chitons (Cryptochiton stelleri) of both sexes weighing
between 600 and 1200 g were obtained subtidally near Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California. They were kept in aerated
