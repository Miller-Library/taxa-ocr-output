Sugar absorption by C. stelleri
radioacitve and chemical techniques. Chemical analysis
gave slightly higher values for the first two hours, due to
the presence of 1.8 mM D-glucose and 3.1 mM D-glucose in
original anterior and posterior tissue samples. Complete
exchange diffusion seemed to occur by the third hour, however,
as radioactive and chemical analysis gave equivalent results,
Radioactively-determined data are presented here, as these
data definitely indicate accumulation of D-glucose from
the medium and are less biased to high tissue/medium D¬
glucose ratios.
fig. 4. Specificity of the posterior intestinal D-glucose
transport system. Incubations of posterior intestinal
tissue were carried out in the monosaccharide media described
beolow. Samples were taken in duplicate at 0, 2, and 4 hrs,
analyzed chemically for D-glucose and radioactively to
determine the behavior of tracers in each environment. The
contribution of added tracers to the total sugar concentration
was negligible ( 3x10 M).
A. D-glucose at 3.0 mM plus 0.04 uc/ml D-glucose-u-c.
Both D-glucose and labeled D-glucose were accumulated by the
tissue. The initial difference between chemical and radio¬
active analysis was due to the presence of 3.0 mM glucose,
in the tissue before addition of sugar to the medium. This
was apparently completely exchanged for D-glucose from the
medium by the fourth hour of incubation.
