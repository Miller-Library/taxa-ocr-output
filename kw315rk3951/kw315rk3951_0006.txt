D-galactose at gn original concentration of 4.5 mM in
the medium was found to be concentrated to 7.0 mM within
posterior intestinal tissue after a three hour incubation.
Results of the accumulation of 3.0 mM D-galactose over an
8-hour period by posterior intestinal tissue are presented
in fig. 1. D-galactose at a medium concentration of 4.5
mM gave an anterior intestinal tissue concentration of 4.4
mM after 8 hours, apparently indicating the lack of a D¬
galactose transport system in this region of the intestine.
Original tissue D-galactose concentrations were less than
0.4 mM, and thus were not a problem in analysis.
The results of an experiment demonstrating saturation
kinetics over a three-hour incubation period by the D¬
galact se transport system of the posterior intestine are
presented in fig. 2. D-galactose accumulation has been divided
into a hypothetical diffusion component and saturable, carrier¬
mediated component, the latter being the difference between
total transfer and the diffusion component. On this basis
the maximum velocity of the transport system (Vmay) is
0.8 millimoles D-galactose/l tissue fluid/hr, and K, the
concentration of substrate necessary to give half the maxi¬
mum velocity, is less than O.1 mM.
D-glucose at an original medium concentration of 5.5 mM
was found to be concentrated to approximately 8.0 mM in both
