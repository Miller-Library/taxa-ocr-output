Sugar absorption by g. stelleri
in vitro by the accumulation of sugar within intestinal
tissue.
2. Proximal anterior intestinal tissue actively absorbs
D-glucose.
3. Proximal posterior intestinal tissue actively absorbs
D-glucose and D-galactose, via separate transport systems.
4. The posterior intestinal D-glucose trasnport system is
apparently incapable of transportin 3-0-methylglucose, a
non-metaboizable glucose analogue in other transport systems.
5. D-galactose uptake by the posterior intestine is very
slow in mammalian terms (Va
= 0.81 mM/hr), although the
D-galactose transport system of Cryptochiton stelleri
shows a greater sensitivity (K, - 0.1 mM) to D-galactose
than does the equivalent system in hamster intestine.
This indicates a slow but efficient accumulation of DÂ¬
galactose at low concentrations by this invertebrate.
