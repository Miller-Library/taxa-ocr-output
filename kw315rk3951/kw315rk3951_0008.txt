Sugar absorption by C. stelleri
0.2 mM D-galactose in the presence of 3.0 mM D-glucose gave
a tissue/medium D-galactose concentration ratio (T/M) av¬
eraging 14.5, while a 0.2 mM control gave a T/M of 17.0
over a three-hour period,
DISCUSSION
A number of assumptions were made in the calculationan
and interpretation of data. Tissue water was approximated
at 80% of tissue wet weight, and sugar was assumed to be
spread uniformly throughout that fluid. Tissue water,
however, is actually a composite of adherent medium,
extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid. There are
furthermore a variety of cell types composing the tissue,
not all of which may be participating in absorption. The
sugar concentrations presented are thus averages of all the
uncontrollable factors related to tissue structure and do not
represent true intracellular concentrations.
It is assumed that transport is a one-way process over
the tie interval studied, and the possible effects of dif¬
fusion and outward transport were not delat with quantitatively
in simple uptake experiments. These effects over a three¬
hour period may be considerable, however, since an everted
sac is presumably filled with sugar by the action of dif¬
fusion over that interval.
Other assumptions made were that all transported sugars
