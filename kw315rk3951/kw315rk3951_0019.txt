Sugar absorption by C. stelleri
B. Three-O-methylglucose at 3.0 mM plus 0.04 uc/ml 3-0-
methyl-+C-D-glucose. Labeled 3-0-methylglucose was not
apparently concentrated by the tissue. Presumably, original
tissue glucose dropped due to passive diffusion.
C. D-glucose at 3.0 mM plus 0.04 uc/ml 3-0-methyl-c-
D-glucose. D-glucose conentration, determined chemically,
rose within the tissue as in A. Labeled 3-0-methylglucose,
however, behaved similarly to the labeled 3-0-methylglucose
in B, and apparently was not concentrated.
