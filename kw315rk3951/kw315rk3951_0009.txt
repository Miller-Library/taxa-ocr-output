were fee in solution in the cells, that tissue slicing damÂ¬
age was minimal, and that the contents of all cells and
organelles were released upon homogenization. The effects
of metabolism were ignored, since chemical and radioactive
tracer analysis gave approximately the same results in all
experiments when original tissue concentrations were
accounted for.
In consideration of all these factors, the concentrations
of sugar determined in these experiments are biased, if at
all, towards a lower tissue/medium concentration ratio.
Thus,
an accumulation of sugar above medium concentration by a
tissue definitely indicates active transport, while no
accumulation (T/M 1) does not necessarily negate that
possibility.
It is also important to realize that the rate of sugar
absorption by intestinal tissue varies from one animal
source to another, thus making the comparison of rates in
separate uptake experiments impossible.
Experimental results thus indicate active transport
of D-galactose by the proximal posterior intestine and of
D-glucose by both the anterior and posterior intestine.
D-glucose transport by the proximal anterior intestine, and
D-galactose transport by the posterior intestine were both
observed in the everted sac studies of Lawrence and Lawrence
(1967). The fact that D-galactose was not accumulated by
anterior intestinal tissue which accumulated D-glucose, and
the fact that D-galactose transport by posterior intestinal
