Sugar Absorption by C. stelleri
cubation medium into everted sacs of proximal anterior in¬
testine, while D-galactose was accumulated by everted sacs
of posterior intestine. Further studies have revealed a
socium coupled galactose transport system in the posterior
intestine of this organism (Lawrence and Mailman, 1967; Puddy,
1970; Lawrence et al., 1972).
Little or no work has been done on the kinetics or spec¬
ificity of the monosaccharide transport systems in the in¬
testinal tissue of Cryptochiton stelleri due to the exper¬
imental limitations of the everted sac technique. I
decided to approach the problem of sugar uptake and related
enzyme kinetics of this organism by measuring the accumulation
of sugar in intestinal tissue itself, as Crane and Mandelstam
(1960) did with hamster intestine. There are two basic
reasons for preferring this technique. First, it is
difficult to elucidate the actual transport mechanism using
everted sacs, as at least two separate processes are occurring
to yield net transport across the intestinal wall: initial
transport into the epithelial cells, followed apparently by
diffusion through the many underlying cell layers to the
serosal fluid. The connective tissue itself, which is 200 u
thick in the anterior intestine (Fretter, 1937), may act
as a significant barrier to free diffusion. With the use
of tissue slices, however, sugar need only enter the epithel¬
ial cells to be measured, and underlying tissue serves as a
