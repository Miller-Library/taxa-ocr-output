Sugar absorption in C. stelleri
Kenneth B. Robbins
unidirectional transport across the intestinal wall seems
reasonable, as Gabe and Prenant (1949) have reported
significant glycogen stores in that tissue for three species
of chitons. Presumably, D-glucose was actively transported
into epithelial cells, but was not converted to glycogen
during the course of the experiments.
Although this study demonstrates the accumulation of
sugar by intestinal tissue, a process which most certainly
is important in the trans-intestinal transport process, no
investigation of Cryptochiton stelleri has yet determined
the entire mechanism by which sugars and other nutrients
are transported across the intestinal wall and into the
body fluids. Histological studies of chiton intestine have
been done (Fretter, 1937; Gabe and Prenant, 1949), but
no cells show the characteristic microvilli of mammalian
epithelia. In mammals, transport is localized in the
microvilli region of the epithelial cells (Wilson, 1962),
thus explaining the unidirectional flux of nutrients across
the gut wall. Exactly how unidirectional flux is achieved
by the intestinal epithelia of Cryptochiton stelleri
remains the greatest enigma of this invertebrate transport
system.
