anterior and posterior intestinal tissue over a three-hour
period (fig. 3). Three-O-methylglucose, a non-metabolizable
glucose analogue in other transport systems (Curran, 1973,
p. 188), was not concentrated by posterior intestinal tissue.
The accumulation of D-glucose, but not of 3-0-methylglucose,
was substantiated by an experiment in which 3-0-methylglucose
tracer exhibited only passive diffusion in both a D-glucose
and 3-0-methylglucose medium (fig. 4). This demonstrates
that the difference in transport of the two sugars is due
to carrier specificity rather than the need for a metabolic
substrate in the medium.
The analysis of D-glucose transport was complicated
by the presence of an average of 3 mM D-glucose in the
original intestinal tissue of chitons starved for three
weeks. Chemical analysis thus gave higher D-glucose
concentrations than tracer analysis for the first few hours
of tissue incubation in a D-glucose medium. By the fourth
hour, however, radioactive and chemical analysis gave
approximately the same results. This was assumed to indicate
the replacement of original cellular D-glucose with D-glucose
from the medium by the process of exchange diffusion.
D-galactose transport in the posterior intestine was
not greatly inhibited by the presence of a relatively high
concentration of D-glucose, thus ruling out competition of
these two sugars for the same carrier. A concentration of
