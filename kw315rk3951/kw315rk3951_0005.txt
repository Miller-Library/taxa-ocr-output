Sugar Absorption by C. stelleri
Znso 7H»0 followed by 2.0 ml 1.8% Ba(OH), for the purpose
of deproteinization, and centrifuged at low speed. The fil¬
trate was analyzed for the appropriate monosaccharides.
Original intestinal tissue, tissue dipped in the experimental
medium, original medium samples and final medium samples
were also analyzed for sugar content.
Determinations of D-glucose and D-galactose were made
by bothe chemical and radioactive techniques. Analysis of
3-0-methylglucose was done only by the radioactive method.
Chemical determinations were done colorimetrically using the
Glucostat and Galactostat reagents (Worthington Biochemical
Corporation). D-glucose-U- C, D-galactose-1-C, and 3-0-
methyl- C-D-glucose were obtained from New England Nuclear
Corporation. Tracer concentrations in the incubation media
were 0.040uc/ml ( 3x10M), added to the non-radioactive
analogues which were present at final concentration.
Radioacitivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting
in a solution of Omnifluor in Dioxane (8 g/1) using
proportional counting by a Nuclear Chicago Unilux II Scaler.
Quenching was consistent for known standards and all
experimental samples.
Data are presented as millimolar concentrations of
sugar in the tissue water. Tissue water was determined to
be approximately 80% of tissue wet weight for both anterior
and posterior intestinal samples, by comparing the wet weights
and dry weights (after 24 hours at 100°C) of pooled samples.
