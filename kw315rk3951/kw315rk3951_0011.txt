organisms. The low temperature environment (11°-14°C)
of Cryptochiton stelleri may, in particular, depress
the rate of any carrier-mediated transport process
(Lawrence and Lawrence, 1967a).
Another unique feature od D-galactose transport in
Cryptochiton stelleri is the extremely low K of the system.
The value cannot be accurately determined from the graph
of carrier transport in fig. 2, but it is definitely in
the range of 0.1 mM or less. The corresponding Ky for
hamster intestinal D-galactose transport is 2.2 mM (Crane,
1960). The D-galactose transport system of Cryptochiton
stelleri thus responds most efficiently at low concentrations,
perhaps compensating somewhat for the low transport rate.
The D-glucose transport system in the proximal posterior
intestine seems to be extremely specific, as 3-0-methylglucose
is not apparently concentrated. Lawrence and Lawrence (1967)
did not detect an accumulation of D-glucose in everted
sacs of posterior intestine. Nevertheless, a decrease
in D-glucose concentration and no decrease in 3-0-methyl¬
glucose concentration was noted in the serosal compartment.
The decrease in D-glucose was attributed to metabolism.
My results suggest, however, that D-glucose was not
metabolized, but merely accumulated in the tissue, while
3-0-methylglucose was not accumulated. The absorption of
D-glucose within the posterior intestinal tissue without
