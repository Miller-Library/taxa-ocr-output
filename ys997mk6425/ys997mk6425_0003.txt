MATERIALS AND METHODS
Beach hoppers were collected at four points on the Monterey
Peninsula (figure 1): Orchestoidea corniculata from two
pocket beaches adjoining Hopkins Marine Station; O. calif-
orniana from Del Monte beach at the Monterey sewage outfall
and from the southern end of Carmel beach. Hoppers were
found by digging in the sand with a shovel or by lifting
segments of wrack. In the former case, the sand was combed by
hand and no hoppers which had been contacted by the metal
shovel were collected. Flies of the species Coelopa van-
duzeei and Fucellia rufitibia were caught at the same sites
A butterfly net was used to trap the flies as they swarmed
above the wrack. In addition, larvae of the coelopid fly
were collected from Carmel and lady bugs from Del Monte
beach. These were taken by hand directly from the wrack
and underlying sand. Sterile flasks were used in all cases
to transport the animals from the collection sites to the
laboratory.
Beach hoppers were retained in collection flasks for 24 hours,
after which they were frozen, washed in distilled water to
remove sand and paracitic mites, and dried at 60Â° for one
day. The same procedure was followed for the fly larvae and
lady bugs. Fly specimens were Killed immediately, however,
with ethyl acetate in a clean killing jar. They were then sorted
by species, washed, and dried. Triplicate samples were col-
lected when possible.
Dried samples were ground to a fine powder and approximately
gram or half-gram aliquots were digested. Ten ml of 90% nitric
acid were added to each sample, which was allowed to reflux
for at least one hour or until clear. The solutions were
then simmered down to 5 ml, cooled, and treated with hydrogen
