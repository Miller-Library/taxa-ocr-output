Metals in Dipterans and Amphipods, 1.
ABSTRACT
Beach dipterans and amphipods were analyzed for heavy
metal levels using atomic absorption spectroscopy.
Flies showed higher concentrations of all major metals.
Very high levels of cadmium were noted in both beach
animals. An increase in metal level with age was
evident in the dipterans. Concentrations of iron,
zinc, copper, and lead were found to fluctuate sig-
nificantly with time.
