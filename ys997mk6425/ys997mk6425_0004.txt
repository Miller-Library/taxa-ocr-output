peroxide until visible oxidation ceased. One ml of hydro-
chloric acid was added, and the samples were diluted to 25
ml with distilled water. A blank containing the reagents
and water was prepared as a control in each digestion.
Analysis for silver, cadmium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel,
lead, and zinc was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer atomic absorp-
tion spectrophotometer model 303. Laboratory standards were
run along with each series of tests to calibrate the absorp
tion scale. As there was no correction for background noise,
values up to 2% absorption were discarded due to possible
inaccuracy. A sample of ethyl acetate was analyzed as a
control for fly specimens. It proved to have no trace metals
of detectable amounts.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Zinc, Iron, Copper and Cadmium: Beach flies showed consis-
tently higher levels of Zn, Fe, Cu and Cd than did amphipods
(figure 2). For the first tiwoe metals this relationship is
anticipated by former research on insects and crustacea
(Bowen, 1966). Unusually high concentrations (up to 240.0
ppm) of iron on the Hopkins Marine Station back beach may be
related to scrap metal from the Monterey Boat Works. Large
pieces of rusting iron are buried in the sand from surface
level to two feet in depth. These are covered by water at
high tide. Runoff from Cannery Row's remaining industries and
restaurants may also circulate metals to this beach. In
addition, erosion of the adjacent loosely-packed soil and
air-borne dust could contribute iron to this beach. Elevated
iron levels (as high as 298.1 ppm) near the Monterey outfall
seem not to be due to especially high metal levels on the
