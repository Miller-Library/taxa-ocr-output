Metals in Dipterans and Amphipods, 6.
(Bowen, 1950). High levels of this metal are moderately
toxic, but the element is essential in trace amounts for
activating enzymes and as a protein constituent.
Lead, Nickel and Silver: Lead, nickel and silver occur in
truly trace amounts in hoppers and flies. The recorded
levels are subject to inaccuracy because of background
noise and difficulty in chart reading. Despite these limit-
ations, it is clear that amphipods concentrate more lead
than do the beach insects. This may reflect the 'mineral
armor" of calcium salts that cover the crustaceans since
lead accumulates in calcareous tissue. The hoppers' lead
level is up to thirty times the amount found in crustacea
from Bowen's (1966) summary, indicating possible local pol-
lution. As yet, no biological function is known for lead.
It is a cumulative poison in animals as it may inhibit
protein and gene synthesis, cellular oxidations, and other
essential functions (Underwood, 1971).
Both silver and nickel, which may be highly toxic in large
amounts, are barely detectable in beach hoppers and flies
with the techniques of analysis I employed. Because they
are so scarce, it is impossible to define any major trends
or comparisons in insects and amphipods.
Higher trace element levels in flies than in beach amphipods
may have several causes. From my own observations in the
field and lab and those of Remmert (1964), it is clear that
both hoppers and flies prefer the same food - brown algae
(in Monterey, Macrocystis pyrifera). Secondary foods of the
two animals differ, however. Flies are attracted to car-
rion and may eat bacteria off the wrack rather than the sea-
weed itself. Borror (1964) states that coelopid flies feed
on flowers near the beach, although I did not find any evi-
dence of this practice at my test sites. The Orchestoidea
species will eat the dead of their own populations but pre-
