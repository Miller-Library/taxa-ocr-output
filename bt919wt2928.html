Although a groat deal of work has been done on sexual determina-
tion and chromosomes of isopods (see Staiger and Bocquet, 1956, and
Teichmann, 1962 for roviews and full references) little has beon re-
ported on tho morphology of the testes used by most of these studies,
Several authors have included decriptions of specializations of the
male pleopods in their broad surveys of isopods (Richardson, 1905;
Van Name, 1936; Menzies, 1950; Gruner, 1965; Schmolzer, 1965) and
some have included drawings of the pleopods of the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Oniscoidea : Exact'>Oniscoidea</span> covered
in this paper (Richardson, 1905; Van name, 1936; Hatch, 1947;). Other
aspects of the biology of the eight species studied here have been
reported (Miller, 1936; Ricketts and Calvin, 1939; Menzies, 1950)
but this information did not include drawings or descriptions of the
testes of any species or of the modifications of the male pleopods
in any species of the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Flabellifera : Exact'>Flabellifera</span> or <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Valvifera : Exact'>Valvifera.</span> This study was car-
ried out to fill in these gaps in our knowledge of these isopods,
ETHODS
The animals studied were collected from intertidal and moist terres-
trial habitats on the Monterey Peninsula. They were either fixed in
ethanol or anesthetized with 15% MgCl. Two or three males of each spe-
cies were dissected from the ventral surface to expose the testes, All
drawings were made with the aid of a camera lucida.

The testes may be seen in figure A to extend anteriorly only as far

except that they are located at the third or fourth segment of the
pereon and theirvas deferens extend posteriorly to a small paired

Figure 4 A-D are of the right testes and the left first and sec-
ond endopodites of the four species of Oniscoidea examined above. In
all four species the testes consist of three elongate tubular struc-
tures connected to a sac-like seminal vesicle at uniform intervals
and leading to a vas deferens. The broad, tapering extensions of the
first endopodites are very similar in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Alloniscus perconvexus : Exact'>Alloniscus perconvexus</span> (A), <span style='background-color:grey' title='Armadillidium vulgare : Fuzzy'>Arm-

are narrow and sickle-like in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. perconvexus</span> (A), <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. vulgare</span> (B), and
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. scaber</span> (D), but much broader and more rounded in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>L. occidentalis</span> (C).
Figure 5 A-E are these same details for the members of the Valvi-
fera and Flabellifera I examined. Both the testes and the endopodites
of <span style='background-color:grey' title='Idothea resecata : Fuzzy'>Idothea resicata</span> (A) are very similar to those of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Idothea stenops : Exact'>Idothea stenops.</span>
The widely spaced, narrow, pointed testes of the Valvifera are in
marked contrast to the broad, bulbous testes of the Flabellifera
which all branch from the end of the vas deferens. The testes and
endopodites of Cirolana harfordi (C) are very much like those of a
small Lironeca vulgaris (D) except for the natatory hairs on the ple-
opods of C. harfordi. The larger Lironeca vulgaris (E) has pleopods
with the tapering style on the second endopodite as on the other males
in this suborder (and the female L. vulgaris) but the testes have lost
much of their form and appear to be in a state of transition or degen¬
eration.

MALE ISOFOD REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURS
DISCUSSION
This study points out that the most variation in male reproduc-
tive structures takes place between suborders and the least between
species of the same genus. The testes are of different shapes and in
different positions in the body cavity, but there are always two sets
of three testes to each male (excepting protandrous forms in transi-
tion) and a vas deferens with variably positioned expansions always
leads from these testes toward the pleotelson. All the species exam-
ined have styles on the second endopodites, presumably to aid in
sperm transport, and some have similar modifications of the first
pair of endopodites. These similarities in reproductive structures
occur where they would be expected if the taxonomy of these isopods
successfully described their phylogeny. Taxonomy in the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Isopoda : Exact'>Isopoda</span> is
usually based on the structure of mouthparts and the shape of body
regions.
The variations observed within suborders probably relate to dif-
ferences in the feeding or reproductive habits of these animals, but
more research is needed to document these relations,

SUMMARY
Dissections and drawings (with camera lucida) were made of the
testes and endopodites of eight species of California isopods. The
Oniscoidea represented by Alloniscus percorvexus, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Armadillidium : Exact'>Armadillidium</span> vul
gare, Ligia occidentalis, and Porcellio scaber have three uniformly
spaced, elongate testes attached to a seminal vesicle at various posi-
tions in the body cavity. All but Ligia occidentalis have a broad
projection from the first endopodite and a sickle-like style from the
second endopodite. The Valvifera are represented by Idothea <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pentidotea : Exact'>(Pent-
idotea)</span> resicata and Idothea (Pentidotea) stenops. Both of these spe-
cies have similar elongate testes spread down a thin vas deferens.
There are no special modifications of the first endopodites in either
species and the second endopodites have a long uniformly wide style.
The Flabellifera also show similarities within the suborder. Cirolana
harfordi and small Lironeca vulgaris both have bulbous, sac-like tes-
tes extending from the apex of a narrow vas deferens which may take
many different paths in C. harfordi. The larger L. vulgaris has only
an amorphous mass of tissue for testes as it begins its transforma-
tion to a female. All three forms have similar tapering styles on the
second endopodites.
The patterns of variation of testes structure between suborders
and the similarities between them were noted,
