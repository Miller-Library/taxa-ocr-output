Daily movement patterns of and pool fidelity in the intertidal fish
anzis was determined. Individuals showed a high degree of fidelity to a specific
tidepool and the majority appeared in their pools on an every day or every other da¬
basis. However, almost 25% of the time the cottids sheltered at some unknown
location at low tide. I was also found that individuals of this species do not stay in
their tidepools at high tide and are shown to be able to return to their pool of first
capture over considerable distances.
INTRODUCTION:
It has been shown of many different organisms found in the intertidal zone
that Individuals within a species can locate a particular area of the intertidal and
repeatedly come back to it during the time of the tidal cycle that is most adaptive for
its suvivability. The chiton M masa is known to occupy a particular
homesite at low tide but moves away from it and back along the same pathway at
times when it is submerged or awash. Similarly, the limpet <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Collisella scabra : Exact'>Collisella scabra</span> returns
regularly at low tide to a specific area of a rock which closely matches the contour of
its shell. However, homing ability is not necessarily consistent among all
invertebrates, for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Collisella digitalis : Exact'>Collisella digitalis</span> shows no homing response in some areas, and
in other areas it returns to a particular homesite only up to 54% of the time (Morris
Abbott and Haderlie, Hvo). Several species of intertidal fish have exhibited the ability
to appear in the same tidepools over wo different low tides when they have been
seen at considerable distances from the pools in which they had last been observed
I was suggested that navigational cues were used to bring the fish back to their
"home" pools and assured them safe refuge at low tide (Williams, 1954). However, a
recentstudy on  an indicated that an absence from the pool in which
an individual was first caught did not necessarily mean the fish had stayed from the
area (Richkus 1978). Instead, by sampling a range of pools once every bo weeks
for a period of 4 months, Richkus presented the ldea that s anas are not
particular to one certaln pool but reside in a "home-range" made up of pools in a
glen area. This report of cottid movement altered the concept of homing as a return
to one specific area of the intertidal that the fish knows will be a tidepool at low tide. It
suggested, instead, that these animals may be residential to an area of tidepools and
regularly refuge in a number of these with a high fidellyy for an intertidal area rather
than to a specific pool. Richkus did not, however, follow the fish on a day to day
basis or monitor their activities at high tide.
As first postulated by Green (1971), the appearance of the same individual in
the same tidepool does not necessarily indicate an Instance of homing, for the fish in
question could have stayed in the pool at high tide and never employed a homing
behavior at all. Green (1971) noted that  us 'regularty" leaves
ts tidepool at high tide In sheltered areas of the intertidal, but he also found that in
more exposed areas the amount of vacancy is markedly reduced. As of yet, there
have been no studles addressing the high tide movements of wnxvtus ana and
although the abilly to home reguires first that Individuals leave their tidepools and
then return, residency in its tidepool at high tide has not yet been assessed.
This study examines the pool occupancy and behavior patterns of
anais on a day to day basis over a limited period of time. Over the course of 18
consecutive days lobserved 31 marked fish in 5 tidepools at low tide to determine the
fidelity of Individuals to specific tidepools In a given area. Furthermore, to be able to
atribute the successive appearances of individuals on different low tide to the
existence of a homing behavior, Ireport here on high tide observations made on 11
days within the study period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
STUDY STTE:
Field work was conducted in an area of protected rocky intertidal at Hopkins
Marine Station, Callfornia (Figure 1). The experimental study site consisted of 5
tidepools of varying dimensions In covering an approximately 4 X 4 m square area
(Figure 2). Pool number 6 indicated on the map was not sampled but was only
observed for the presence of tagged indlviduals. The pools varled in physlcal
dimension and topographical characteristics, and height ranged from +0.62 m to
41.08 m relative to mean lower low water. These pools proved to be particularh
suitable for my study because of the abundance of  n relative to
other cottid specles. In addition, all of the pools that were sampled were free of large
cracks and crevices in which the experimental fish could possibly hide, so that on
each experimental date my low tide counts of individuals were accurate and
complete. Dimensions and characteristics of each of the pools are presented in
Appendix 1.
CAPTURE, TAGGING, AND RELEASE:
All pools were cleared of fish on the low tide before dally observations began,
and on each lowtide observation Icaught and tagged all new fish present. Because
each tidepool was small enough to capture the fish using onty a dip net and my
hand, I did not need to use anesthetic in my capturing technique, thus minimizing
disturbance to both the fish and the pool itself. Individuals were brought back to the
lab, and tagging occurred within several hours after capture. The fish were briefly
anesthetized with 2 drops of 202 Oulnaldine diluted in isopropyl alcohol in
approximately 250 ml of sea water to determine length and specles. Loose
following a similar method suggested by Willlams (1957) and Green (1971), tagged
Individuals of each pool using 1 or 2 colored embroidery beads of unique
combinations sewed midway into the caudal musculature just posterior to the second
dorsal fin. Becovery from the anesthetic occurred within minutes after the fish was
returned to fresh sea water. Individuals were kept in aquaria until the next low tide te
allowtime for acclimation to the beads before releasing them back into their pool of
capture. When released, all fish showed normal swimming behavior and appropriate
color change to their surroundings, so l assumed the effects of Quinaldine and
tagging to be minimal. To test my tagging method, Ibeaded 10 fish and kept them in
aquaria for 22 days. During this time perlod, onty 1 fish lost its beads due to
inadequate knotting, and this happened on the 15th day of observation. Feeding
behavior and swimming motions did not at all seem to be altered by the tagging
technique. During the course of my tidepool observations, however, recovered
many individuals that had a large tear in their caudal muscle, indicating that these
were previously tagged individuals that had apparently lost their beads. In these
instances 1 noted the length of the fish and retagged the individual anterior to the
previous tag. In addition, Iperformed fin clips on the one or both of the pectoral fins
in unique combinations to aid in the identification of individuals when beads were
lost. On several occaslons found a fish that had already been tagged twice, and
retagged the fish a third time in the dorsal musculature. In previous studies that
followed fish over a substantial period of time, data on individuals was severel
limited because tag loss was substantial. However, my sample size was a suitable
number to use the length of the fish in combination with the day in which it was
caught to identify those fish that had lost their tags and retag them. A total of 31 fish
were tagged over 15 days of observation from May 18 to June 4.
FIELDÖBSERVATINS:
Pools were examined dally when exposed by low tide from May 18 to June 4.
On each occasion lobserved each pool for approximately 10 minutes without pool
disturbance, recording each fish that! saw.I then made a thorough search of my
pool using the handle of the fish net to observe all those fish that were previousy out
of view. All new fish were caught and tagged or retagged as was needed. For a
detalled account of daily observations and releases, see Appendix 2.
fh
Fldelly to a glven pool was determined by the number of times a fish was
seen in its original pool of capture divided by the number of low tides
observed from the first sighting of the fish to the last and reported as a
percentage. Fish that were observed for 3 days or less were not used in the
fidelity calculations, for a fish that was seen 3times in its original pool of
capture but was seen only over a total of 3 days would show 100 % fide lit
when, In fact, the amount of time It was observed was not enough to say the
individual was 100% partial to Es pool.
DEPR
Several tests were done to determine fideliyy of fish to an area by tagging
and displacing fish. Icaught and tagged 5 fish from 2 pools, Pool A and Pool
B, 50 cm away from each other and 16m away from my area and,
released them into Pool 2. On another occasion Iperfonned the
displacement experiment on 3 more individuals from a pool 18 m away, Poo
C. Individuals varied in length from 2.7 to 5.2 cm.
MT-TARe
On two occasions lobserved the tide coming in and the tide going out over a
40X 40 cm area, which lcalled Area A, located between pools 3 and 5 (Figure 2). At
this time lobserved and recorded behavior of the fish in pool 3 as the water both
filled and drained the area.
t e
On 11 days, from May 22 to June 4,1 snorkeled at a high tide height of 1.2 to
1.3 mrelatwe to mean lower low water so that ! could reach my hand into the pools
and accurately assess If Individuals were present or not. After pools were thoroughly
checked, lobserved the area between the tidepools and the outside area up to 1
meter In permeter and recorded presence of fish and behavlor. Distance from
original pool of capture was estimated using a waterproof slate which was 15 cm in
length (See Appendix 3).
RESULTS:
Low Tide Observations:
The population of tagged individuals generally declined over the course of
the study perlod as is reflected in Figure 3, with a maximum number of 17 on the first
day that all pools were sampled to 8 on the last day of observations. Individual pools
tended to vary in their decline, with pools i and 4 maintaining the same population
as the frst day observed.
Fidely
Fidelity to the tidepool of firstrelease is shown in Table 1. Out of the 31 tota
number of fish tagged, 21 individuals were observed for 4 days or more and were
Included in the fidelity calculation. Ofthe 21 fish, only 3 were found to have a 50% or
lower fidelly to a particular tidepool, and 18, or 86% of the population, had a greater
than 60% fidelity to the tidepool in which they were first captured. Length varied with
fidelly, with the fish In the 4.0 to 4.9 cm range showing a 9125 fidellt while those In
the 5.0 to 5.9 range showed onty 56% fidelit (Figure 4). One must note, however,
the small sample size of those in the 5.0 cm range, for 3 out of the 6 tagged fish in
this length range were never seen more than 4 days and were thus excluded from
the calculations.
Men Paterns
Because watched the pools on a dally basts, could ascertain distinct
movement patterns among individuals (See Figure 5). Over the course of the study,
only 3 fish were seen In any of the other 4 experimental pools. On each occasion,
however, never again saw that individual in the pool of its first capture, suggesting
that it had perhaps relocated to a different pool entire ly. 4 individuals each missed 2
consecutive lowtides at the beginning of my observations, but then returned to ther
original pools and appeared there on an every day, every other day basis. Only one
fish missed 3 low tides in a row, and this individual also returned to a regular
schedule of every day appearance at low tide. The great majority of the fish, or 67%6,
however, were never gone from their pool for more than a day, with some individuals
appearing consistently every day such that lalmost expected to see them on each
observation. One of these indlviduals showed an exceptional 100% ridellty by
Inhabiting the pool every day for each of my 12 low tide counts (See Appendix 4).
Dipkeen
On the next low tide after the displacement experiments were performed, all
tagged individuals were gone from Pool 2. Upon examination of Pools A, B and C,
observed 100% return of beaded fish in Pools A and B, and 2 of the 3 returned to
Pool C. The fish that was missing from Pool C was the smallest individual captured,
measuring 2.7 cm in length (See Appendix 5).
Mid Tide Observations:
RRTTAY
Ontwo occasions lwatched Area A next to tidepool 3 as the tide level moved
lower than this point. Ofthe 7 fish that were subsequently observed to be in the pool
when it was completely isolated, 1 saw 4 individuals of Pool 3 in this area
approximately 20 cm away from the lip of the pool. The surge was high as the waves
moved Into this area, and at times the fish were no more than 2 cm under the water.
At one time the surge moyed out so quickly as to leave one individual standed
without water for several seconds until the next wave came in. At this time the fish
moved towards the lip and eventually down into the pool. Actlviy seemed to be
directed to moving slowly down into the pool with each lower surge, and occasionally
saw some of the fish exhibit a feeding behavior on some neighboring algae. On
one instance  saw a tagged fish from Pool 3 Inhabiting Pool 4. Before the pools
were isolated, however, the fish moved from Pool 4 into its original pool and
remained there till the next high tide.
lalso observed the tide as Itcame In over Pool 3 and flooded Area A. As the
water moved higher, individuals tended to orient themsewes vertically with thel
heads up on the sides of the pool, and with every surge they moved higher on the
rock and closer to the surace. As was observed during the tansition as the tide wert
out, the fish tended to remain only 2 to 3 cm underneath the surface of the water unti
the pool was flooded enough so that they could move into Area A. 5 of the 7
individuals observed at the previous low tide, all within 3.1 to 3.5 cm, were the first
fish out of the pool and they were seen in Area Aas soon as t had been covered with
water. The same fish that ! had seen move from Pool 4 to Pool 3 as the tide went out
swam over the bordering rock and again exited Pool 3 into Pool 4. Activity was
conslderable, with the fish actkely moving up with the water as well as feeding at
areas not accessible to them at low tide. Upon looking into Pool 3 at this time, also
noticed à large, newfish present that had not been there before at the low tide.
High Tide Observations:
RRTIKY
At high tide, the fish within one meter from the edge of the pools were all
sitting very stationary on horizontal rock faces or sometimes positioned obviousyy in
shallow cracks In the granite.I saw minimal movement at this time, and lwas even
able to snorkel directly over the fish without apparent disturbance. did not see fish
hidden in the algae or beneath rocks or debris, but saw them instead siting in
exposed areas of the study site. On 10 of the 11 high tide observations made,
discovered one or more large sculpin » 10 cm in length in the bottoms of the pools,
and once lobserved an eel blenny in Pool 3. Surfperch were also seen swimming in
the area over my study site.
Cunsand Dan hon B
The number of fish inside the pools at high tide was exceptionally small. On
any given day, the percentage of fish out of their pools was consistently over 80%,
with 3 occasions of 100% vacancy (See Table 2). Most of the fish, ranging from 4224
missing on one occasion to 91% on another, disappeared from the entire study area,
and a maximum of 7 and a minimum of 1 individual seen on any one day. Of the one
third that remained, 95% were seen within 50 cm of their pool of first capture. Fish
inside the pools ranged in length from 3.5 to 5.5 cm and 4 individuals were seen
twice each in their respective pools.
DISCUSSION:
Fromthe above resutts it ls apparent that over a course of 18 days, a majorit
of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Chtus anais</span> individuals have a high fidelity to specific tidepools and
regularly return to them at low tide. From the resutts of the displacement studies
observed fidelly to a tidepool was not due simply to the fact that those fish were
replaced there at low tide after capture; hence, the appearance of an individual tice
at à certaln tidepool Indicated that other factors affecting fidellty were Involed. Upon
comparing these findings with those of Richkus (1978),was surprised to discover
the remarkably small percentage of fish that missed more than 1 consecutive day
away from the original pool of capture, for he reported that samplings in bo week
intervals showed a low percent of recapture of tagged individuals in their original
pools, and he further demonstated a rise in this percent recapture as he sampled al
pools In the area. It is interesting to note that ! found only 3 individuals out of 31 that
appeared in any one of the other 5 pools observed, comprising only 14 % of the
population, as opposed to the 67% of tagged fish that appeared only in their original
pools and occaslonally moved elsewhere out of the study site for no more than one
low tide. These findings suggest that the daily movements of individuals over an
approximately two-week perlod follovs a markedly different pattern than those
reported for the same specles in a different habitat, sampled biweekly. An alteration
of the earlier schematic due to these new findings suggests that, on the time scale
observed, the majority of individuals have either one or more pools to which they are
faithful outside ofthe study area, or they have a series of pools in which they reside
only bansienty in addition to their primary pool of residence (Figure 6). As it has
been reported that an undistured population of  an also declinec
over a similar period of time (K. Jensen, 1989), the population decline observed ma
not be due to the tagging disturbance but can possibly be attributed to the longer-
term Intertidepool migration suggested earlier. To determine this, however, periods
of dally observations would need to be continued for more than bo weeks and a
greater area of tidepools assessed for appearance of individuals.
High tide data shovs that members of the Catis anats species cleart
do not inhabit their tidepools at high tide and the majority of them do not reside in the
area one meter adjacent to these areas. Ir the fish are not in their pools nor are in the
immediate vicinity, they must move to areas greater than one meter away, suggesting
that perhaps mechanisms of homing are used to direct individuals back to their
primary pool of residence. Results from the displacement experiments clearty
support the presence of navigational ability sufficient to carry out homing, for within
one tidal cycle, individuals as small as 2.8 cm were able to successfully return to the ir
respective pools over 16 meters even though the pools themselves were separated
only by 50 cm in distance. It would seem plausible that an accurate homing
mechanism serves a key evolutionary purpose in these intertidal fish, for if they are
accidentally swept away from their pool of residence or bavel conslderable distances
In search of food or other attractants, it would be adaptive to have a mechanism to
bring them back to a familiar area of the intertidal so that they are not caught above
water or arbirarlly rind a tidepool that may not be physically advantageous (le
presence of predators, minimal algae cover, insufficient oxygen levels, etc.). In
addition, homing permits the exploitation of a larger area of the intertidal, anc
movement patterns associated with the tidal cycles, weather, and seasons may
necessitate homing as the fish search over a greater area for food resources.
The surprising Invasion of cottids larger than 10 cm in length in places that
were inhabited by identified fish raises questions as to the behavior and
whereabouts of the tagged individuals if they were not within immediate distance of
their pools. Observations made at times of tidal moyement in and out of the area
elucldates aspects of the behavior of the cottids as their small world is suddenty
expanded to a vast subtidal terrain. At these tansitory times, l observed the fish
closely following the surface of the water, as if they were waiting until the very last
moment when they could either exit the pool or enter it, and they were prepared to
cope with both the forces of the waves and the possibility that they would get
stranded without water for a short period of time In return for the possible benefits
they recelved from reduced predation risk, feeding andlor engagement other
unknown activities. I larger cottids Inhabit the tidepools and perhaps take advantage
of their benefits at high tide because their own size prevents them from surviving
there at low tide, it could be that the smaller cottids equally participate in a
downward vertical shit to explolt the resources that can be galned there without
competition or predation from larger fish.
Although littie is known about the behavior of Chxxxtus ana at high tide
and the reasons for frequent movement of individuals over long distances, t ls clear
that these fish do not stay in their original tidepools at high tide and are particularly
good enough homers to find a specific tidepool again at low tide and reside in it on a
farrly regular schedule. These results, therefore, support an alternate definition of
homing in htus anai for its behavior does not seem to fit elther a pattern of
faithful homing or exploitation of any of a set of pools in a home range. Instead,
Clixttus anats may alternate between onty one or to pools in an area that it
considers its "home", and may reside there until the need for resources causes it to
temporarily leave the area and return at a later time. Fidelity to these pools may alse
be important in partitioning the resources of small refuge pools without overloading
them. Much additional work needs to be done in the area of possible navigational
ability and mechanisms of homing, however, and future observations of individuals
during the tidal change may prove to be useful in elucidating much of the behavior of
chxus anis that remains unknown.
