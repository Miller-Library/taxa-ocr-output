Introduction:
Negligence in disposal of complex industrial effluent
has stimulated studies on the biological processes of
accumulation of trace elements in organisms and the physio¬
logical effects of these elements on marine life. Bowen
(1966) reported that brown algae concentrate copper to
levels ground 11 parts per million and mercury to .03
parts per million. Goldberg (1963) recorded the natural
levels of these metals in the open sed. Copper ranges from
between 3 to 10 parts per billion while mercury is present
at levels about .2 parts per billion. Ihis represents
approximately a hundred fold increase in mercury concen¬
trations and at least a thousand fold increase in copper
concentrations. Studies on the effects of trace elements
on photosynthesis have been done recently on populations
of marine phytoplankton. Harriss, White, and MacFarlane
(1970) demostrated the relative toxicity of organomer-
curial fungicides on photosynthesis of the marine diatom
Nitzschig delicatissimg and a naturally occuring phyto-
plankton population taken from a fresh water lake. These
mercurial compounds reduced photosynthesis by at least 50%
at concentrations of one part per billion. Steemann Nielsen
and Wium-Andersen (1970) observed similar inhibition in
the photosynthesis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Nitzchig
paleg with cupric ion concentrations as low as five parts
per billion.
