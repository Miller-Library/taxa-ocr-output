Discussion
P. perforata, when exposed to a Cu concentration of
1000 ug/liter, exhibited about a 42% reduction in photosyn¬
thesis (as calculated from the mean values). Standard
devidtions indicate at least a 68% probability that repression
of photosynthesis is occurring (Fig. I). Mercury concen¬
trations (Fig. II) exhibit 35% inhibition at 500 ug/liter
(68% probability) and complete inhibition at 1000 ug/liter
(99% probability). It is interesting to note that this
latter dose was not lethal and plant respiration still
occurred (Figs. II and IV). When copper and mercury ions were
added to solution in equal concentrations (Fig. III),
productivity at 500 pg/liter represented only 21% of the
value obtained from the control samples (99% probability).
Although this decrease is greater at this concentration
that those indicated in the other trials, it must be
reiterated that the cupric and mercuric ions were both
present in solution at a concentration of 500 ug/liter,
There is no indication from this data that the mercury and
copper ions act together synergisticly to inhibit photosynthesis.
Although an insufficient number of trials were performed
to determine, with any statistical validity, the effects
of these metallic ions on plant respiration, dark bottle
trials (Fig. IV) do not show any significant inhibiting
or enhancing effects. More precise measurements and g.
greater number of experimental trials would be necessary
to determine whether or not these trace elements affect
the respiratory mechanisms.
