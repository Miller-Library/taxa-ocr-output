O
of central Californig, is an upwelling region which supports
high levels of primary production (Ryther, 1969). High
productivity maintains abundant quantities and diversity of
marine florg and faung. Contamination of this ared due to
mineral runoff and industrial effluent might contribute
significant amounts of mercury, copper, and other inorganic
and organic waste. Prelimingry productivity experiments
done at Hopkins Marine Station have indicated that cadmium
ions in solution influence productivity in natural phytoÂ¬
plankton populations as well.
Benthic algge and phytoplankton are subjected to marine
pollutants over ocegnic seasons and long term exposure might
increase inhibition of photosynthesis at low concentrations,
damaging internal cellular enzymes systems, decreasing
productivity capacities. Selective toxic stress might
alter species composition of the algde populations and
produce florg imbalance. Upsetting the primary producer
tropic levels can have drastic influences on the ecological
balance and stability of the coastal marine communities.
