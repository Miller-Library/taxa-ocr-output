Abstract:
Inorganic copper and mercury, at concentrations as
low as a half part per million in sed water, reduced
photosynthesis in samples of Porphyrd perfordtd. Simildr
effects were observed in phytoplankton using even lower
concentrations of copper in solution. Neither the mercuric
or cupric ions indicated any effects on plant respiration
nor gny signs of synergistic action as inhibitors of photoÂ¬
synthesis in Porphyrg.
