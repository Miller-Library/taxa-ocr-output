environment would then consitute a matrix layer between 2.5
to 20 microns thick. In Porphyrg, the cell wall consists
primarily of the polysaccharides xylose and mannan (Kreger,1962).
The polysaccharide fibrils contain many of the same chemical
groups mentioned previously in conjuction with organic enzymes
and have been shown to exhibit an affinity for strongly electro¬
negative cations (Bonner and Varner, 1965). Thick cell
walls, then, might absorb metallic ions. Bowen (1966)
pointed out that brown algae concentrates copper as much
as to 11 parts per million. Large concentrations of metallic
cations in the external environment might be necessary to
cause significant repression of the photosynthetic enzymes
in benthic algae.
Bowen also listed data which indicates that phytoplankton
samples,consisting primarily of diatoms, concentrate copper
to levels as high as 200 parts per million. Despite these
high levels, the diatoms are far more sensitive to low concen¬
trations of copper than are benthic algae. Although silica is
an essential constituent of diatiom cell walls, the primary
component is pectin (Fritsch, 1948), a colloidal carbo¬
hydrate which contains a large proportion of anhydrogalacturonic
acid. The carboxyl groups of polygalacturonic acids also
show an attraction for metallic cations. Since the cell wall
surface to cytoplasmic volume ratio is greater in digtoms
than in Porphyrg, it seems physically possible that digtoms
could be concentrating metallic ions at higher levels than
benthic algae in the same gquatic environment. Since thick
siliceous walls would shut off the cytoplasm from the environ¬
