The effects of the different copper concentrations were
recorded as percentages of photsynthesis as compared to
the control samples.
Results:
Tables 1-3 depict milliliters of oxygen produced per
gram dry weight of plant material when exposed to increasing
concentrations of metallic cations. Table I shows the mean
values for gross photosynthesis when copper, as cupric nitrate,
was used. Variance, standard deviations, and the number of
trials for each experiment are also listed. Table II expresses
the same information for gross photosynthesis in P. perforata
under varying concentrations of mercury, in the form of mercuric
chloride. Table III indicates the results obtained when both
Cu'Y and Hg' were introduced into solution at equal concentraÂ¬
tions.
Tables IV-VI show the results of the relative respiratory
rates. Table IV relates copper concentrations to milliliters
of oxygen consumed by the plant during the 1 hour incubation
period. Table V corresponds to the mercury concentrations while
Table VI indicates the effects of the two metals together in
solution.
Table VII contains the results of the phytoplankton
productivity experiment. Different concentrations of copper
ions in the phytoplankton suspensions produced a decrease
in primary productivity as indicated by the counts per minute
mean values and the percentage of control sample productivity,
