for marine organisms in coastal intertidal and subtidal
communities. Although they represent only a small fraction
of the total marine primary production, the bulk of coastal
productivity is effected by the attached plants (Gilmartin, 1969).
The benthic algae are important in terms of producing detritus
material used for food by marine invertebrates. Other species,
notably the brown algae, Macrocystis, serve as the primary
food of larvae forms of fish. For these reasons, the effects
of ionic copper and mercury on benthic algae productivity and
respiration were investigated. Porphyra perforata, a red algde
common to the Monterey Peninsula, was used as the experimental
subject. This species of Rhodophyta is found in the uppermost
level of the intertidal zone and is capable of surviving 24-48
hours out of water. It has a broad monstromatic thallus
which is easily identified by its deeply rullfed margins,
brown-purple coloration, and disc-shaped holdfast (Smith, 1944).
Its hardiness and egsy identifiable characteristics make this
algae a convenient experimental subject.
Materials and Methods:
P. perforatg was collected on the middle reef of Moss
Beach (35°36 42 N, 121°56 42 W) located on the western
exposed coast line of the Monterey Peninsulg. This point
is situgted between Point Joe and Point Pinos. This collection
site was selected because of the abundance of P. perforato
in the vicinity. In addition, the turbulent wave action
of the region constantly brings in open ocean water, which
presumably has lower concentrations of trace elements, in shore.
