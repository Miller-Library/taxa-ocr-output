Samples were collected during the late morning hours and
kept in seg water until utilized. All samples were used
on the same day as collected. Crossections (approximately
12.5 cm) were taken from the thalli using a nonmetallic
punch. Sea water, drawn 100 meters off the coast of Point
Cabrillo (Hopkins Marine Station) from the surface and collected
in polyester plastic containers, was filtered through
Whatman GF/C filter paper to remove particulate matter and
phytoplankton. This water was used to make up different concen¬
trations of metallic ions in solution. Plant samples were
incubated in the solutions and left undistrubed in 125 ml B.O.D.
glass stopper bottles for 224 hours in a water bath set at
151.5°C and at a constant light intensity of 450 foot-candles.
In order to measure the rate of photosynthesis and respiration,
both "light" bottles, in which the plant material is illumingted,
and "dark" bottles, in which the bottles were wrapped with
alumium foil and light was not allowed to reach the plant,
were used. In the light bottles both photosynthesis and respira¬
tion could occur. In the dark bottles only the process of
respiration would be active since photosynthesis depends on
light to act as an energy source to initial activity.
At the end of the initial incubation period, samples
were removed from the light. Water in the bottles was
drained off and deoxygenated water containing identical
metal concentrations was replaced. Samples were replaced
in incubation for 1 hours. Plant material was then removed
and dissolved oxygen measured by the Winkler method as described
by Carpenter (1965). Factors were introduced into Carpenter's
