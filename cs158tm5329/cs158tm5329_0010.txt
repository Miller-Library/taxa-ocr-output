ment, many species of diatoms have developed direct connections
between the cytoplasm and the external environment by means
of pores in the cell wall or the raphe in some digtoms (Fritsch,
1948). Direct contact between the cytoplasm and the water
might allow metallic cations to flow past the cell wall and
affect cellular enzymatic systems directly. Diatoms may,
then, concentrate trace metals at higher levels than does
P. perforata yet remain more sensitive to low concentrations
of these toxicants. It is interesting to note that Chlorello
pyrenoidosg, the green microalgde, is less inhibited in its
photosynthesis than is Nitzchig paled, a marine diatom, at
equal concentrations of copper (Steeman Nielsen and Wium¬
Andersen, 1970).
Additional physical factors, such as the greater surface
areg to volume ratio, might also be facilitating material
entry into phytoplankton. Other metabolic processes might
explain this selective sensitivity in other, non-physical,
terms.
Wave action and currents, important aids in diffusion
properties of dissolved materials, might also increase productiv¬
ity or metallic cation entry into benthic algde. In a
natural system, concentrations of dissolved metallic ions
would remain at constant levels as currents would help in the
diffusion of these ions to greas where plant material might
be absorbing them. These conditions were not simulated in
the benthic algae experiments and might play an important role
in increasing inhibitory effects.
