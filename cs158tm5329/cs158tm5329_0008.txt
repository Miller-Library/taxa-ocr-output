As pointed out by Mandelli (1969), cellular material
consists of organic macromolecules which contain phosphate,
amino, carboxyl, and sulfhydryl groups which can act as parts
of regctive sites on enzymes. Strong electronegative
metallic cations, such as copper and mercury, when added to
algal cultures in concentrations which exceed metabolic
requirements, may form strong chemical bonds with these
groups. These reactions could inactivate enzymes and have
gdverse effects on cellular metabolism, transport, and synthesis.
Copper and mercury ions could be affecting the photosynthetic
enzymes in a similar manner or be reducing the cells' materidl
transport systems and the supply of raw materials to the
chloroplasts.
Steeman Nielsen and Wium-Andersen (1970) showed that
copper reduced photosynthesis in the diatom Nitzchid poled
70% and in the green algae Chlorella pyrenoidosd approximately
25% at copper concentrations of 10 ug/liter. Data collected
here at Hopkins Marine Station indicate about 15% reduction
in photosynthesis. Phytoplankton, then, is affected in
photosynthesis by concentrations of copper ions one to two
orders of magnitude less than are needed to produce simildr
effects in P. perforata, a red benthic algde. One explandtion
for this resistence might be found by comparing the structure
and physiological properties of plant cell walls. According
to Smith (1944) the thallus of P. perforata ranges ip thick-
ness from 45 to 140 microns. The single loyer of ellpsoiddl
cells within this structure range in length from 40 to 100 microns.
