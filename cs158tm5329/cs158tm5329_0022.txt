I wish to acknowledge and thank Dr. Malvern Gilmartin
for his patience and helpful advise and criticism. I also
wish to thank Dr. Isabella A. Abbott for her assistance
in algae morphology and identification and to Mr. George
for his encouragement and help with trace metal analysis.
Special regards go to Peter Davoll and Dave Bracher, the
oceanographic technicians without whose practical assis¬
tance I would have been unable to master valuable oceano¬
graphic techniques.
My gratitude to the entire faculty, staff, and student
body of Hopkins Marine Station and Biology 175H for the
opportunity of working with them in this program.
