original equation to correct for differences in sample
bottle volumes and the volume of the plant material.
The initial oxygen concentrations in the deoxygenated
sea water was subtracted from the values obtained after
incubation to determine the change in oxygen concentrations
due to photosynthesis and respiration. The plant material
was dried at 80°c for two hours and weighed on tared aluminum
discs. Oxygen production was calculated in terms of milli-
liters of oxygen per gram dried weight. Estimates of the
relative rates of gross photosynthesis were measured by
adding the values of milliliters of oxygen produced in the
light bottles to the values of oxygen consumed in respiration
as indicated from the dark bottles.
As a comparison study, a test was made with phytoplankton
to examine the effects of different concentrations of copper
ions in solution. Phytoplankton samples were collected
at CalcOFI station 3, located above the Monterey Canyon,
in the middle of Monterey Bay, while aboard Hopkins Marine
Station's ocegnographic research vessel Proteus. Surface
water containing phytoplankton was collected and innoculated with
different copper solutions and five microcuries of radioactive
carbon-14. Samples were incubated in 125 ml glass stopper
bottles for 3 hours at 14°C with a constant light intensity
(2.5 millivolts on a photocell). Samples were then filtered
through .45 micron millipore filters and carbon uptake
measured with a gas-flow detector proportional counter,
Nuclear-Chicago model D-47. The number of discharges recorded
per minute served as rate indicators for photosynthesis.
