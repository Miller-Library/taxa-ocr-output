Duration of Bouts:
47 bouts of rolling were recorded (see Table 1). The average duration
of a bout was 1 minute 17 seconds (range = 7 seconds to 5 minutes 30
seconds). Adult males were most frequently observed rolling: adult pairs
were involved in 36/47 or 77% of all bouts, adult/subadult pairs were
seen in 7 bouts, subadult pairs in 1 bout, and subadult/juvenile pairs in 2
bouts. No pups were seen rolling; however, this study ended just as they
were being weaned. Adult/subadult bouts lasted almost twice as long as
adult bouts, 2 minutes 18 seconds (range= 17 seconds to 5 minutes 30
seconds, n=7). The single subadult bout observed lasted 1 minute 25
seconds, and the two subadult/juvenile bouts averaged 28 seconds (rangeÂ¬
7 seconds to 49 seconds, n=2). The Mann-Whitney statistical test for
small sample sizes was conducted on this data, and only the difference in
time between adult/adult bouts and adult/subadult bouts was found to be
statistically significant.
Pairs identified as male were involved in 38/47, or 80.9%, of all bouts.
Females were seen together in 1 bout, 5 bouts involved males with a seal
of unidentified sex, and the remainder of bouts both seals were of
unidentified sex. Males and females were never seen rolling together. The
average bout between males lasted 1 minute 34 seconds (range= 7 seconds
to 5 minutes 30 seconds); the one timed bout between females lasted 49
seconds. When analyzed using Mann-Whitney, the only significant
difference in duration was between males and unidentified seals (X= 16
seconds, range= 8 to 24 seconds, n=3, p=0.0191).
Duration of Encounters:
The mean duration of an encounter was 3 minutes 11 seconds (range=7
seconds to 12 minutes 41 seconds, n=20). Adult males were again most
frequent partners. Adult pairs (disregarding sex) were involved in 14719,
or 73.7% of all encounters, with an average encounter duration of 3
minutes 14 seconds (range= 8 seconds to 9 minutes 1 second, n=14); the
remainder of encounters were between adult/subadult pairs (X=5 minutes
