APPENDIX
Individuals:
Over the course of this study l was able to identify six individuals
which I saw rolling at least once, including two females seen in mounting
behavior. For the benefit of future research on rolling in this population,
shall describe these individuals here:
1)RawChin Male - a grey adult male with a pink spot on his chin where the
skin had been rubbed off; if this is not a scar, it will most likely leave one.
saw him rolling with a brown subadult male on two separate occasions.
2)Pockhead Male - a brown adult male with a pocked region on the right
side of his head, seen in one encounter.
3)VerticalScar Female - a brown adult female with a long vertical scar on
the right side of her chest, seen in encounter with ThroatScratch Female.
4) ThroatScratch Female - a grey adult female with several scratches
across her throat, visible when she lifts her head back. Seen in one
encounter.
5) GrouchoMarx Male - a yellow-grey subadult with dark marks above his
eyes, resembling eyebrows. Seen in one encounter. Not to be confused
with two raccoon-eyed juveniles in the area (one male, one female).
6) TailScar Male - a grey adult male with 2 long slashes in his penile
region, near the base of his tail. Seen rolling on three separate occasions.
