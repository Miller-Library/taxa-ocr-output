Head to Head Twisting:
This type of rolling is comprised of two seals aligned in fairly close
proximity, usually vertically in the water column, who exchange blows to
the throat and neck (see Figure 3). As suggested from the description,
throat and neck biting are most common. This type of rolling is typically
medium in intensity.
Head to head twisting constituted 5/59, or 8.47%, of all rolling
incidents. It was also most common in adult males: exclusively adult
pairs were involved in 475 incidents, three of which were male, the fourth
a male with a seal of unidentified sex, and a male adult/subadult pair was
responsible for the fifth incident of twisting. This type of rolling was
associated with every type, most commonly head to tail vertical
rolling and both types of mounting behavior.
Head to Tail Horizontal Rolling:
This type of rolling is one of two variations involving head to tail
somersaulting; I have divided the two by the orientation of the bodies to
the substrate. Head to tail horizontal rolling is tail-chasing on a
plane parallel to the substrate (see Figure 4). Tail biting is most common,
although biting is not integral to the act.
Head to tail horizontal rolling was seen 3 out of 59 times, or
5.09%. This was seen exclusively in adult males. It was seen in
association with its variant, head to tail vertical rolling, and with
mounting back to stomach most frequently, but was also seen with
head to head twisting and stomach to stomach mounting. It was
sometimes associated with bubble-blowing, a behavior in which the seal
emits a cloud of bubbles from its nose or mouth (which orifice of the head
that the bubbles came from was undetermined).
Head to Tail Vertical Rolling:
This type of rolling also involves somersaulting tail-chasing, as in
head to tail horizontal rolling, but the seals are instead oriented on a
vertical plane (see Figure 5). This type of tail-chasing also involves tailÂ¬
