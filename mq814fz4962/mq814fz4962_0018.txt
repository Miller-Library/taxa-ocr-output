ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
thank Stuart Thompson for lending me gear so 1 could get in the water;
Dennis Powers for lending me The PInnipeds so 1 could know which animal
to look at once I was in the water; and Alan Baldridge for sharing his
enormous wealth of knowledge of pinnipeds with me so that 1 knew what
was looking at once 1 found the animal. I would also like to thank the
other "Seal People" for sharing information and interest; my roomates Jen
and Edith for their help and understanding; my parents for providing the
funds that made this quarter possible; Jim Harvey for advice and
information; Nicole Crane for gear, footage, endless camera help, and
everything eise 1 forgot; and Chuck Baxter, for his patience, advice, "red
marks", and for still taking time for students after so many years of
teaching. Most of all, I would like to thank the Hopkins Marine Station
seals for making this wonderful experience possible.
