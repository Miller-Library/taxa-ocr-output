well as smaller seals. If a seal too close to a rolling pair was snapped at,
it would swim off, either a little ways or altogether.
Types of Rolling:
Over the course of the study I was able to identify six types of rolling
(see Table 2). Some of them differ only by the plane of rolling or relative
body position. They are described below. All bouts of rolling were
divided into incidents, and each time a new type of rolling began it was
considered a new incident.
Head to Head Horizontal Rolling:
This type of rolling has never been described in the literature. In head
to head horizontal rolling one seal grasps the other by the throat or
the back of the head with its teeth and begins spinning rapidly in a
horizontal plane, in an extended bite (see Figure 2). The two seals are
parallel to the substrate, their heads in close proximity, forming a
straight line with their bodies. The seal being grasped does not seem to
have any control over its speed of rotation; the grasping seal seems to
completely dominate the encounter. I did not see this type after May 7.
Head to head horizontal rolling comprised 5 out of 59 incidents of
rolling, or 8.47% of all incidents. It was primarily engaged in by adult
males: adult pairs comprised 4/5 or 80% of all head to head horizontal
rolling; 3 of these pairs were male, while the fourth was a male with a
partner of unidentified sex. The fifth incident was an adult/subadult pair
of males. Neck biting and throat biting were both common; it was
necessary to have one of the two to perform this type of rolling. In one
case the seal being grasped was also seen foreflipper-scratching wildly.
This type of rolling was roughest in intensity out of all types, due to the
speed of revolution and length of biting combined. Head to tail vertical
rolling, head to head twisting, and mounting stomach to stomach
were all associated with this type of rolling.
