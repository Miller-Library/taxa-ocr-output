with its foreflippers, and no biting was observed. This behavior most
strongly resembled that of males by the stomach to stomach alignment of
the two females.
This behavior was seen in association with every other type of rolling.
most commonly head to tail vertical rolling and head to head
twisting
Back to Stomach Mounting:
This behavior was very similar to stomach to stomach mounting.
except that the grasping seal and its partner were aligned ventral to
dorsal, and neck biting was more common (see Figure 7). The grasped seal
froze in position, as in the previous type, and the seals also frequently
sank to the bottom substrate. The grasping seal frequently displayed a
bulging penile line or an extruded penis, and in one case was actual seen
thrusting his penis towards his opponent's stomach (also male). Usually,
however, the two seals were almost immobile, and the intensity of the
interaction was very mild; sometimes there was not even biting involved.
Back to stomach mounting comprised 14/59, or 23.73%, of all
incidents. Although it was largely an adult male activity (9/14 of all
incidents involved pairs of adult males), adult/subadult male pairs were
seen engaged in this behavior 3 times, and subadult/juvenile female pairs
were observed twice. The behavior of the female pairs again differed from
that of male pairs, and was similar to the female stomach to stomach
mounting behavior; the female on top grasped the female on bottom
briefly and then began foreflipper-scratching the bottom female's head.
All types of rolling were associated with this behavior, most commonly
head to tail vertical rolling and head to head twisting. Rumbling,
foreflipper-slapping, and bubble-blowing were sometimes associated with
back to stomach mounting.
DISCUSSION
This study coincided with the pupping season, late April to early May
(Riedman, 1990) and the beginning of the mating season, 3 - 4 weeks after
