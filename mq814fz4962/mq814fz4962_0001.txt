ABSTRACT
Rolling is an aquatic interaction between two seals which involves
head to tail somersaulting, mounting, and twisting and writhing
movements as the seals bite each other. It has been alternately explained
as male/female mating behavior, play, and dominance establishment;
however, it has only been studied from land. This underwater study found
that rolling is almost exclusively male, and probably serves to establish
dominance and mating priveleges during the breeding season.
