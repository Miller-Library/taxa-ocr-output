are much smaller, narrower and more abundant. This fundamental difference may be the
reason that this group of invasive species appears in such a great abundance in the reefs
of F. enigmaticus. Further investigation is needed.
Schwindt and Iribarne (2000) showed that F. enigmaticus changes the community
structure in a soft sediment lagoon in Argentina by providing habitat for the carnivorous
crab Cyrtograpsus angulatus. These crabs then changed the abundance and species
distribution of soft sediment species through predation. Future work could investigate
similar effects of trophic interactions on the community within F. enigmaticus
microhabitat. By providing habitat for carnivorous or omnivorous animals such as
Pachygrapsis crassipes or any of a number of errant polychaetes, F. enigmaticus could
be indirectly changing the community structure in Elkhorn Slough. A driving factor of
the community structure in F. enigmaticus may be how certain species are interacting,
not which ones are present or absent. The characteristics of F. enigmaticus may be
important only in attracting a group of carnivorous species which subsequently shape the
infaunal community through ecological interactions.
Despite differences in the invasive assemblages within these two microhabitats,
no previously undocumented invasive species were found within F. enigmaticus.
However, Wasson et al. (2001) showed that despite distance from the international port
of San Francisco Bay, great numbers of invasive species are capable of invading Elkhor
Slough. F. enigmaticus appears to provide suitable habitat for species that do well
globally in complex, hard substrate. It is therefore possible that F. enigmaticus could act
as an attractor for new invasive species that might not otherwise become established in
Elkhor Slough.
