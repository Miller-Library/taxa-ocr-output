Ficopomatus enigmaticus is an invasive reef-building tubeworm that originated in
Australia and was first discovered on the West Coast of the U.S. in the 1920's (Carlton
1979). This cosmopolitan organism can be found in abundances up to 80,000
individuals m (Bianchi et al. 1995) in reefs that grow to 20 m* and occupy up to 80% of
the available hard substrate (Schwindt and Iribarne 2000). F. enigmaticus was
discovered in Elkhorn Slough in 1994 and nine years later, it has spread throughout the
slough, greatly increasing the amount of hard substrate available in the system (Wasson
et al. 2001). It is likely a successful invader because it possesses traits that are different
from most of Elkhorn Slough's native species. Davis et al. (2000) argued that this was a
necessary factor in the success of an invader because native species are expected to
already occupy all niches.
Simberloff and Von Holle (1999) proposed an invasional meltdown hypothesis
whereby a group of exotic species interact with each other in ways that facilitate and
mutually improve the success of each other's invasions. This results in greater overall
success and increased impact of the invasive species. Facilitative interactions such as this
are at â€œleast as common as detrimental ones" (Simberloff and Von Holle 1999). Many
invasive species possess a life history dependent at least in part on the use of hard
substrates and/or interstitial spaces (Wasson et al. 2001), which F. enigmaticus may
provide. Furthermore, the majority of animals found on non-biogenic hard substrate in
Elkhorn Slough are invasive (Heiman pers. comm.). The introduction of large amounts
of hard, three-dimensional microhabitat may have significant positive effects on the
abundance, spread, and impact of other invasive species within Elkhorn Slough. Because
of the characteristic mudflat environment in Elkhor Slough, F. enigmaticus may
