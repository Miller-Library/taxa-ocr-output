Conclusion
My results show that F. enigmaticus creates biogenic microhabitat that harbors a
significantly different assemblage of species than that found in the microhabitat created
by the native oyster O. lurida. These differences are due primarily to patterns among
invasive species; native species found in these two microhabitats are distributed similarly
However, there are significant differences in the native community among sites,
suggesting that native organisms have more localized patterns of distribution and
abundance that rely less on the nature of the substrate and more on undefined physical
characteristics of the sites. Invasive species occur more frequently with F. enigmaticus
over O. lurida. These patterns merit further detailed investigation.
