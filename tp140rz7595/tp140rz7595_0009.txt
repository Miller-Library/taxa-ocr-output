differences in the assemblages among sites (P -.001 and .002) and between habitats (P -
041 and .026)
To investigate these results further, MDS (Figs. 3, 4) and ANOSIM (Table 3)
were performed on the invasive and native components of the samples separately. The
MDS plot of invasive species (Fig. 3) shows more overlap among sites (P =.08,
ANOSIM) and more consistent separation between microhabitats (P =.006, ANOSIM).
Thus, for the invasive assemblage, there are significant differences in structure between
microhabitats, but not among sites. The MDS plot of native species (Fig. 4) shows clear
grouping of sites (P =.001, ANOSIM), but not microhabitats (P=. 25, ANOSIM).
Comparisons of species abundance (standardized by weight) between
microhabitats show that F. enigmaticus harbors a greater abundance and proportion of
invasive species per gram of sample than O. lurida (Fig. 5). However, the two
microhabitats have approximately the same abundance of native species.
Differences between microhabitats are driven in part by a predominantly invasive
group of species (Table 4, Fig. 6). The seven invasive species account for 52.54% of the
difference between F. enigmaticus and O. lurida microhabitats.
Discussion
Ficopomatus enigmaticus creates biogenic microhabitat that houses an
assemblage significantly different than that housed within the microhabitat created by O.
lurida. The community differences are found only in the invasive component of the
assemblage, however. Invasive species are found in greater abundance and in a higher
percentage within F. enigmaticus than in O. lurida while native species are distributed
evenly among the two habitats.
