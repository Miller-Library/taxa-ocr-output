Different sites in the estuary have clearly distinguishable assemblages of native
species, probably due to heterogeneity of regions in the slough. The species that are
driving these differences are two native crabs, Hemigrapsis oregonensis and
Pachygrapsis crassipes, and Cirratulus cirratus, a native polychaete. C. cirratus was
found only at KPRR while H. oregonensis was never found at BRL, and only rarely at
KPRR, while P. crassipes was found at both BRL and KPRR in similar abundances, but
never at HL. Öther species such as the two Boccardia sp. and Phoxichilidium femoratus
contributed less to the differences.
Due to the distribution of these species, and possible artifacts of the analysis.
these differences were inadvertently driven mostly by the presence/absence of species,
which is not a good indicator of community structure because it ignores other species that
are distributed between all sites in significantly different abundances. Because native
organisms seem to be distributed differently at different sites throughout the slough, it
may be the case that the distribution of native organisms is dominated by site
characteristics other than the microhabitats in which they are found. The physical
differences between these sites are not apparent, though they may be related to
disturbance regimes at the sites, distance from the mouth of the slough, or flow dynamics.
The invasive assemblage shows the opposite pattern found for the native
assemblage. There is significant dissimilarity in the invasive assemblage only between
microhabitats, but no significant dissimilarity among sites. Invasive species are wide¬
spread throughout Elkhorn Slough, but occur with F. enigmaticus to a greater degree than
with O. lurida.
