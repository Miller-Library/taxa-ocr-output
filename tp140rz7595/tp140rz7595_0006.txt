Each half of the cores or clumps was then placed in a 500 um sieve and washed in
situ to remove mud and clay. Samples were then placed in plastic bags and stored in a
cooler. Samples were processed further upon return to Hopkins Marine Station.
Clove oil was added to samples to relax the organisms and minimize breakage
during processing. After twenty minutes exposure to clove oil, samples were transferred
to one liter glass jars and filled with a ten percent formalin solution for fixing. After
three days in formalin, samples were rinsed and transferred to ethyl alcohol. Organisms
were stained with Rose Bengal added to the ethanol to facilitate sorting. Once transferred
to ethanol, samples were ready to be sorted.
For sorting, samples were first purged of their ethanol and washed in freshwater
through a 500 um sieve. Washing removed any remaining mud and flushed any
interstitial invertebrates out of the crevices and interstices. Larger pieces of oyster shell
or F. enigmaticus tubes were removed once rinsed and saved later weighing. Once
samples were washed, the sieve was gently placed in a still water bath which allowed
amphipods to float to the surface where they were skimmed off and counted. The
remaining portion of each sample was systematically examined under a dissecting
microscope at 9x power (some identification was done at higher power, up to 55x) and all
individuals except F. enigmaticus and O. lurida were identified, counted and removed.
Identification was done using Smith and Carlton (1975), Morris, Abbot, and Haderlie
(1980), Fauchald (1977), Hartman (1968), Light (1978), and an Elkhorn Slough infaunal
photographic key prepared by K. Heiman (pers. comm.). Unidentifiable amphipods were
identified by Peter Slattery at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in Moss Landing, CA.
and Freya Sommer at Hopkins Marine Station identified Runcina macfarlandi.
