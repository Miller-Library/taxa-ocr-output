Reefs of F. enigmaticus around the world host assemblages similar to the one
represented by invasive species in Elkhorn Slough. The two invasive species (M.
insidiosum and M. nitida) responsible for a large portion of the differences (29%
between these two microhabitats are seen in the same habitat in England, Argentina, and
Italy. Thomas and Thorp (1994) also found Streblospio sp., Tubificoides sp., Polydora
sp., Eteone sp., and Capitella sp. in F. enigmaticus reefs in England while Schwindt and
Irirbarne (1998) found Heteromastus sp., Polydora sp., and B. hamata in Argentina.
At the genus level, all of the invasive species found in this study were found in
other studies of interstitial assemblages associated with F. enigmaticus around the world
except Grandidierella japonica (Bianchi et al. 1996; Thomas and Thorp 1994; Schwindt
et al. 1998, 2001). Two were found at the species level. Monocorophium insidiosum, the
invasive amphipod that dominates F. enigmaticus assemblages in Elkhorn Slough, is
responsible for the most (15.6%) difference between F. enigmaticus and O. lurida
assemblages. It is a native of the east coast of North America, but has also established
itself as a prominent global invader of estuarine systems. (Bianchi et al. 1996; Thomas
and Thorp 1994; Schwindt et al. 1998, 2001). The amphipod is part of the interstitial
community of F. enigmaticus in England (Thomas and Thorp 1994), Argentina
(Schwindt and Irirbarne 1998), Italy (Bianchi et al. 1996), and San Francisco Bay
(Carlton 1979). The other invasive species from Elkhorn Slough found elsewhere was
Boccardia hamata in Argentina (Schwindt and Irirbarne 1998)
F. enigmaticus microhabitat comprises a very dense grouping of individual tubes
creating complex, branching interstices that eventually fill with mud and sediment.
Compared to the more open interstices of O. lurida microhabitat, those of F. enigmaticus
