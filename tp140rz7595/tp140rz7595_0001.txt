Abstract
The spread and impact of invasive species is a major threat to ecosystem integrity
and biodiversity. Understanding the dynamics of invasions is vital for successful
management of estuaries and wilderness areas worldwide. The reef building tubeworm.
Ficopomatus enigmaticus adds hard, complex structure to Elkhorn Slough, an
environment without much native hard substrate; Östrea lurida, a native oyster, creates
the only analogous microhabitat. To determine if changes in community structure are
associated with the introduction of F. enigmaticus reefs, 10 cm diameter cores from both
types of biogenic microhabitats were collected from intertidal sites in Elkhorn Slough.
Three sites were sampled, one with both F. enigmaticus and O. lurida, one with only O.
lurida, and one with only F. enigmaticus; each site comprised 3 cores. Cores were sieved
to 2500 um in the field, preserved, and all organisms were sorted to species and counted.
Of the 21 species found in the cores, 7 are not native to Elkhorn Slough. Average
number of native individuals per core was approximately the same in F. enigmaticus
(21.6) and O. lurida (19.5) but F. engimaticus harbored, on average, 4 times more
invasive individuals than O. lurida. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and analysis of
similarity showed significant dissimilarity (P =.006) in the invasive assemblage between
microhabitats but no significant dissimilarity among sites (P = 083). The same analysis
showed significant dissimilarity among sites (P=.001) and no significant dissimilarity (I
—.253) between microhabitats in the native community structure. Dissimilarity between
microhabitat types was shown to be driven primarily by the abundances of four invasive
species, Monocorophium insidiosum, Melita nitida, Tubificoides brownae and
Streblospio benedicti.
