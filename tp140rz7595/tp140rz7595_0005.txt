(Bat Ray Lagoon (BRL)) were present, and one with both species present (Kirby Park
Railroad Bridge (KPRR)). The three study sites were all in the upper Slough where F.
enigmaticus occurs at the most sites (Fig. 1). Criteria for collection were to obtain equal
numbers of samples, to collect nearly complete vertical profiles of the microhabitats, and
to sample sites with significant populations of O. lurida or F. enigmaticus.
At HL and for the O. lurida samples at KPRR, 3 cores were chosen from each
reef. A standard starting point of reference and a random numbers table that gave us three
numbers (x, y, z) were utilized to decide what location in the reef to core (x feet in, y steps
to the left [z even) or right [z odd). For the F. enigmaticus samples at KPRR and O.
lurida samples at BRL, no extensive reefs are present, and so entire isolated clumps of
each were taken, using two random numbers (x, y) to decide where to sample (x steps to
the north Ly odd) or south sy even).
Once locations of cores were decided, a 10 cm diameter auger was used to isolate
a core down to the primary substrate. This method was only used for the F. enigmaticus
samples at HL, all other samples were taken using a 10 cm diameter coffee can and a
spade to dig them out. At all sites except the KPRR F. enigmaticus samples, the cores
were also split into top and bottom halves. The KPRR F. enigmaticus samples didn't
penetrate deep enough into the substrate to be divided. For the samples using the auger
(HL F. enigmaticus), depth of the core was measured while still in the auger and each
half was then processed separately. At all other locations, "top" was considered the
entire part of the sample that was erect and standing above the mud while "bottom" was
everything down to the primary hard substrate.
