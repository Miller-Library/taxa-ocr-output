facilitate interactions with species that utilize complex hard substrate in the slough
Invasive species may be much better suited to exploit F. enigmaticus reefs than the
majority of natives that are mostly adapted to soft sediment environments. Furthermore,
F. enigmaticus may actually increase the number of non-native species establishing in
Elkhorn Slough by creating microhabitat that invasive species are better adapted to utilize
than native infaunal species.
The native microhabitats most analogous to the invasive reefs of F. enigmaticus
are aggregations of the oyster Ostrea lurida, which occur sporadically throughout
Elkhor Slough. The infaunal assemblages within reefs of F. enigmaticus reefs are
significantly different from assemblages living outside of the reefs in the soft sediment
(Heiman unpubl. data). However, it is not known whether the same, predominantly
invasive, assemblage that is found in F. enigmaticus reefs structure is present in other
hard biogenic hard substrate such as O. lurida.
To evaluate the impacts of F. enigmaticus on native community structure, the
present study examined differences between assemblages found living in the biogenic
microhabitats of F. enigmaticus and O. lurida. This comparison will be vital in
determining whether F. enigmaticus is altering community structure by increasing the
distribution and impact of invasive species. The results may be utilized in conjunction
with other work to aid in the management of F. enigmaticus in Elkhorn Slough.

-Collection and Processing
The study was performed in Elkhorn Slough from April to May 2003. Three sites
were involved: one each where only F. enigmaticus (Hudson Landing (HL)) or O. lurida
