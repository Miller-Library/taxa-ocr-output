Introduction
Biological invasions represent one of the most challenging, and fastest growing,
environmental problems faced today. The spread of non-native species is responsible for
ยง138 billion annually in recovery and management costs in the U.S. alone (EPA 2003).
Invasive species threaten ecosystems through their rapid spread, competition with native
species, consumption of limited resources, and often severe alteration of habitat (Byers
2000, Vitousek and Walker 1989, Crooks 1996, Grosholz et al. 2000, Stachowicz 2001).
Like many other habitats, the aquatic ecosystems of central California, including
Monterey Bay are threatened by biological invasions. In recent years, Monterey Bay and
its associated ecosystems have seen the introduction of many non-native species with
potential for great impact including Undaria pinnatifida in Monterey Harbor, and the
invasive tubeworm, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, in Elkhorn Slough.
Elkhorn Slough is a coastal wetland located due east of Moss Landing, California
in the center of Monterey Bay. It contains the second largest area of estuarine habitat in
California, comprising dunes, marsh, oak woodlands, maritime chaparral, and mudflats,
but generally lacking significant amounts of native aquatic hard substrates (ESNERR
website 2003). Freshwater is supplied primarily near the mouth of the slough by the
Salinas River channel and from runoff from nearby agricultural lands, so the upper
slough tends to experience high salinity (Wasson et al. 2001). Its ecological significance,
physical characteristics, and species composition have been thoroughly investigated
(Wasson et al. 2001; Carlton 1979). Approximately 500 native marine invertebrates are
known from Elkhorn Slough (Caffrey et al. in Wasson et al. 2001); Wasson et al. (2001)
documented the presence of 56 exotic species.
