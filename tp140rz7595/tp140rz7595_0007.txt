Once a sample was sorted, the ethanol was discarded and the reef fragments were
placed in the fume hood to dry. Dried samples were then weighed with the previously
removed larger segments and their volume measured by water displacement.
Because F. enigmaticus samples were characteristically heavier and more
voluminous than O. lurida samples, the raw counts were standardized by mass and
volume. The standardization factors were determined by taking the lowest mass among
the samples and dividing the mass of each sample by it. Each species' abundance in a
sample was then divided by this number to obtain a standardized data set. This method
was repeated for volume.
-Analysis
The site-by-species matrix of abundances was analyzed using PRIMERS
(Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research, Plymouth Marine Laboratory,
United Kingdom). Separate comparisons were performed on the invasive and native
components of the samples for both sites and microhabitats. This allowed for a
meaningful comparison of the invasive assemblage in relation to the native assemblage
species with in the two biogenic microhabitats.
Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was performed on the Bray-Curtis
similarity matrices calculated among both sites and microhabitat (F. engimaticus vs. O.
lurida). MDS uses the similarity values in the Bray-Curtis to plot relative distances
between samples on a dimensionless grid. It begins randomly with one value that relates
two samples, plots them as a function of their similarity, and continues through the entire
matrix so that distances between all samples on the plot are proportional to their
similarity in the Bray-Curtis.
