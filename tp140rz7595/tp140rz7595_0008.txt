In addition to MDS, a second element of Primers, the ANOSIM test, was used to
measure the similarity between samples according to site and microhabitat. ANÖSIM
uses the Bray-Curtis matrix and compares the similarities of samples within groups with
those among groups. It then returns an r value from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting that all
replicates within groups are more similar to each other than any replicates from other
groups. AP-value is also returned indicating the significance of the results.
Finally, the SIMPER test was used to determine which species contributed most
to differences among sites and among microhabitats.
A more detailed discussion of MDS, ANOSIM, SIMPER, and the rest of
PRIMER is available in Clarke and Warwick (1994).
Results
Species composition and abundance varied significantly both among sites and
among microhabitats (F. enigmaticus vs. O. lurida) (Table 1, Appendix 1). Of the 21
species found in the samples, 7 are invasive. Approximately 11 times as many
individuals (334.1 vs. 30.56) were found in the top of the cores than in the bottoms.
Because there were so few animals in the bottoms of the cores, the bottoms were pooled
with the tops to give total abundance per core. The pooled data were used for the rest of
the analysis.
An MDS plot of all species (Fig. 2) shows that there are differences in the
assemblages associated with the two microhabitats and among sites. ANÖSIM found
significant dissimilarities among sites (P =.001) and between microhabitat (P =.041).
Standardizing by volume or weight yields the same results: there are significant
