mammalian tumor cells. The MDR-specific monoclonal antibody C219
(Georges et al., 1990) indicated a single band of similar molecular
weight (about 150 KD) as a band resolved from a sample of tumor
cells that over-express the MDR phenotype. (See Figure 6) From
these results we conclude that the MDR-like activity in M.
californianus involves a P-glycoprotein related mechanism.
RHODAMINE CONCENTRATION DEPENDENCE
Finally, we found that this MDR-like efflux pump is sensitive to
extremely low concentrations of rhodamine. At 1 nM extracellular
rhodamine, we were able to detect a 100% increase in rhodamine
accumulation in the presence of verapamil. This result suggests that
the MDR-like efflux pump is sensitive to very low concentrations of

substrate. Thus, even though most toxins in the aquatic environment
are found at nanomolar concentrations, the Mytilus efflux pump
would be able to effectively prevent their accumulation.
However, at extremely low concentrations (1 pM), virtually no
rhodamine was accumulated either with or without the presence of

verapamil. Also, at rhodamine concentrations above 2uM, we were
unable to detect a significant increase in accumulation in the
presence of verapamil. (See Figure 8) At such high extracellular
concentrations, the inward diffusion may be so great that the fraction
of influxed rhodamine exported by the saturable efflux pump is
unresolvable by our assay, as depicted in Figure 10.
