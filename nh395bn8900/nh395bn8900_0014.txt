CONCLUSION
From the results of this study, we conclude that the marine
mussels, Mytilus californianus and Mytilus edulis, possess a toxin
efflux mechanism analogous to the multi-drug resistance described
in mammalian tumor cells. Furthermore, since this efflux mechanism
is sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of substrate, it may provide
effective defense against natural toxins found in the marine
environment.
