the low intracellular rhodamine concentration in the presence of
NaAz.
VERAPAMIL INHIBITS AN EFFLUX PUMP
We found that verapamil enhances rhodamine accumulation by
inhibiting an efflux pump. When tissues were incubated in a low
concentration of rhodamine and then placed in sea water, verapamil
significantly slowed the rate of rhodamine efflux. Suppose, as in
Figure 9, that in sea water a concentration gradient and an efflux
pump together decrease intracellular rhodamine concentration.
the efflux pump is inhibited one would expect a slower rate of
decrease of intracellular rhodamine, as seen in Figure 4.
However, at high initial intracellular rhodamine concentrations,
we see no decrease in rhodamine efflux rate in the presence of
verapamil. The higher intracellular rhodamine concentration
increases the concentration gradient when the tissues are placed in
the sea water. Thus the concentration gradient provides a much
larger fraction of the total efflux force than it does at low
concentrations. Since the pump then represents only a very small
fraction of the total efflux force, we can see no difference in efflux
rate when the pump is inhibited. (See Figure 10)
WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS
We employed western blot analysis to detect a protein in the
M. californianus gill related to the P-glycoprotein found in resistant
MDR in Mytilus; Bard and Cornwall, 1992; 12
