WESTERN BLOTS
Mytilus californianus gill tissue samples were tested by
western blot analysis for the presence of a protein related to the
mammalian MDR P-glycoprotein. Chopped samples of M.
californianus gill tissue were homogenized in hypotonic lysis buffer
(10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10mM Tris HCl, and 2 mM Phenylmethyl
Sulfonyl Fluoride) and then sonicated in 5% SDS. Proteins from gill
tissue samples and from human tumor K 562 R7 cells that
overexpress the MDR P-glycoprotein were resolved on a 7.5% SDS
polyacrylamide BioRad Mini-Protean II gel and transferred to
nitrocellulose as described by Otter et al. (1987). The P-glycoprotein
specific monoclonal antibody C219 from Centocor, the epitope
sequence of which was determined by Georges et al. (1990), was
used to locate the P-glycoprotein in the MDR-positive R7 cell and gill
samples. The blots were developed by the alkaline phosphatase
assay described by Mierendorf et al. (1987).
