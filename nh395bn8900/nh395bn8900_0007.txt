RESULTS
RHODAMINE UPTAKE WITH AND WITHOUT VERAPAMIL
We incubated M. californianus gill tissues in 1 uM rhodamine
with and without 22 uM verapamil for 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120
minutes to characterize rhodamine accumulation over time. As seen
in Figure 1, a much greater accumulation of rhodamine occurred in
the tissues which were incubated in the presence of verapamil. With
verapamil, the fluorescence appeared to level off after one hour in
the solution at approximately a 500% higher level than the tissues in
the absence of verapamil. Without verapamil, the fluorescence
remained low, peaking at around 30 minutes, decreasing slightly, and
levelling off after one hour.
INHIBITION OF RHODAMINE ACCUMULATION BY OTHER DRUGS
Since rhodamine accumulation levelled off after one hour of
incubation, we tested the other competitive inhibitors by measuring
rhodamine fluorescence at the 60 minute time point only. As seen in
Figures 2 and 3, gill tissue samples from both Mytilus californianus
and Mytilus edulis showed increased accumulation of rhodamine in
the presence of known MDR competitive inhibitors: verapamil,
vinblastine, trifluoperazine, emetine, quinidine, and forskolin. M.
californianus tissue samples exposed to the drugs displayed
increased fluorescence greater than 500% of the control with a
maximum of 1700% in verapamil (see Figure 2). The M. edulis tissue
