samples incubated in these drugs demonstrated fluorescence greater
than 350% of the control with a maximum 440% with forskolin (see
Figure 3).
In similar rhodamine assays, tissues were incubated in the
presence of sodium azide (data not shown), an electron transport
chain blocker (Neyfakh, 1988), to test for the ATP dependence of the
efflux mechanism. No significant increase in rhodamine
accumulation was found in either species.
RHODAMINE EFFLUX
We next attempted to determine whether verapamil increased
rhodamine accumulation by inhibiting an efflux pump. To examine
efflux, we loaded tissues with fluorescent dye and then measured
efflux in the presence of verapamil. M. californianus tissues were
incubated in 1 uM rhodamine for one hour and then incubated in
sea water with and without 22 uM verapamil for 30, 60, 90, and 120
minutes. As shown in Figure 4, the tissues incubated in plain sea
water showed a decrease in fluorescence to slightly above natural
fluorescence levels after about 30 minutes. However, tissues
incubated in sea water containing 22 uM verapamil showed a much
slower decrease in fluorescence, remaining over seven times higher
than natural fluorescence at two hours. (See Figure 6)
We also incubated tissues in 2 uM rhodamine and 22 uM
verapamil for one hour, and then incubated them in sea water with
and without 22 uM verapamil for 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
Under these conditions, unlike the 1 uM rhodamine incubation, there
