COMPETITIVE INHIBITION ASSAYS
The first piece of evidence is the enhanced accumulation of
rhodamine B in the presence of MDR inhibitors such as verapamil.
Rhodamine accumulation in sea water is low, but in the presence of
verapamil, intracellular rhodamine content increases to over 800% of
control. Since the concentration of verapamil in the incubation is

much higher than that of rhodamine (11-22,000 -fold), verapamil
competes successfully for binding sites on the P-glycoprotein.
Therefore, verapamil is effluxed and rhodamine B is allowed to
accumulate within the cells.

The same result is found with the inhibitors vinblastine,
trifluoperazine, emetine, quinidine, forskolin as shown for Mytilus
californianus in Figure 2, and Mytilus edulis in Figure 3.
ATP-DEPENDENCE
We found that the metabolic inhibitor, NaAz did not inhibit
MDR activity in Mytilus, although mammalian MDR has been found to
be energy dependent (Horio et al, 1988). NaAz prevents reduction of

cytochrome oxidase, thereby blocking the electron transport chain
and the production of ATP via aerobic metabolism. Bivalves such as
M. edulis are able to function under anaerobic conditions for several
days producing over 60% of the ATP produced under normal

conditions (de Zwaan and Wijsman, 1975). This ability would allow
the MDR efflux pump to continue functioning and would account for
MDR in Mytilus; Bard and Cornwall, 1992; 11
