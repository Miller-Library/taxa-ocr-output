was no significant difference between rates of fluorescence decrease
in the presence or absence of verapamil over two hours. (See Figure
5; see Discussion section for further explanation.)
WESTERN BLOT
We then tested for the presence of a protein related to the P-
glycoprotein responsible for mammalian MDR. Western blot analysis
of M. californianus gill tissue with the monoclonal antibody C219
revealed a single band, parallel to a 150 kD band from human tumor
R7 cells which over express the MDR P-glycoprotein. (See Figure 6)
RHODAMINE CONCENTRATION DEPENDENCE
To determine the range of rhodamine concentrations over
which activity of the efflux pump is detectable, we incubated M.
californianus gill tissues in varying concentrations of rhodamine with
and without 22 uM verapamil for one hour. As shown in Figure 8,
there was no significant increase in rhodamine accumulation in the
presence of verapamil at 2.5 uM rhodamine. Likewise, we found no
difference in rhodamine accumulation with and without verapamil at
0.1 nM rhodamine, as shown in Figure 7. However, between 1 nM
and 2uM rhodamine, there was at least a 100%, and up to a 500%,
increase in rhodamine accumulation in the presence of verapamil,
suggesting the presence of MDR-like activity. (See Figure 7)
