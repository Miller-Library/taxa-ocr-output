few seconds to remove excess rhodamine from interstitial spaces.
The tissues were then placed, free-floating, in sea water in 5 mL
petri dishes for examination. The rhodamine epifluorescence in
individual cells in each tissue sample was observed with a 40X
water-immersion lens on a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. The
intensity was measured by a light meter and recorded in volts by a
digital multimeter. Measurements for each sample were completed
in less than 10 minutes. In each tissue, 25-40 cells were measured,
and means and standard deviations were computed.
MDR ACTIVITY CHARACTERIZATION ASSAYS
To assess rhodamine uptake over time, tissue samples were
incubated in 5 mL of luM rhodamine/sea water solution with and
without 22 uM verapamil for 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
The tissues were then rinsed and examined as described above. To
assess rhodamine efflux over time, tissue samples were incubated for
one hour in 1 uM rhodamine and were then placed in 5 mL sea
water with and without 22 uM verapamil for 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and
120 minutes. This protocol was repeated for tissue samples
incubated for one hour in 2 uM rhodamine and 22 uM verapamil.
Fluorescence measurements were made as described above. All sea
water and solutions were kept at 18-20 Â°C, except during
examination when the microscope light warmed the sea water dish.
