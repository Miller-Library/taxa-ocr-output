Eigure 1 Rhodamine uptake kinetics. Verapamil enhances
rhodamine accumulation. Tissue samples were incubated in 1 UM
rhodamine with and without 22 uM verapamil for varying lengths of
time. Percent increases are indicated above each point.
Figure 2. Competitive inhibition by MDR inhibitors. MDR inhibitors
enhance rhodamine accumulation. Mytilus californianus gill tissues
were incubated for one hour in 1 uM rhodamine with and without
known MDR competitive inhibitors: verapamil, trifluoperazine,
emetine, forskolin, quinidine, and vinblastine. Fluorescence values
are represented as percentages of control fluorescence (without
inhibitors = 100%).
Eigure 3. Competitive inhibition by MDR inhibitors. MDR inhibitors
enhance rhodamine accumulation. Mytilus edulis gill tissues were
incubated for one hour in 1 uM rhodamine with and without known
MDR competitive inhibitors: verapamil, trifluoperazine, emetine,
forskolin, quinidine, and vinblastine. Fluorescence values are
represented as percentages of control fluorescence (without
inhibitors = 100%).
Eigure 4. Rhodamine efflux. Verapamil inhibits an efflux pump.
Mytilus californianus gill tissues were incubated in 1 uM rhodamine
for one hour and then placed in sea water with and without
MDR in Mytilus; Bard and Cornwall, 1992; 19
