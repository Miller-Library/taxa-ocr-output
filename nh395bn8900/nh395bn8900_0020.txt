verapamil for varying lengths of time. Time = 0 represents

placement into the sea water rinses. Data reported as mean
fluorescences with standard deviations. Percent differences are
indicated above each point.

Eigure 5. Rhodamine efflux. High rhodamine concentrations mask
inhibition of efflux pump. Mytilus californianus gill tissues were
incubated in 2 uM rhodamine with 22 UM verapamil, and then
placed in sea water with and without 22 uM verapamil. Time = 0
represents placement into the sea water rinses. Data reported as
mean fluorescences with standard deviations.
Eigure 6. Western Blot. MDR-related protein found in Mytilus gill.
Single band in lane six represents P-glycoprotein from human tumor

R7 cells that over-express the MDR phenotype. Single band in lane
two represents protein found in sample found in Mytilus
californianus gill tissue. Proteins traveled toward bottom of page.

Figure 7. Rhodamine concentration dependence. MDR activity found
at 1 nM rhodamine. Mytilus californianus gill tissues were incubated
for one hour in low, varying concentrations of rhodamine with and
without 22 UM verapamil. Fluorescence represented as raw data.
Data reported as mean fluorescences with standard deviations.

Percent differences are indicated above each point.
