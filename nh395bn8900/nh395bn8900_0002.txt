INTRODUCTION
Mussels (Mytilus sp.) are hardy organisms which are able to
successfully colonize heavily polluted waters. This character
suggests that these bivalves may possess a mechanism to resist the
toxicity of the diverse array of compounds found in aquatic pollution.
We have found in the marine mussels, Mytilus californianus and
Mytilus edulis, a mechanism of toxin resistance similar to the multiÂ¬
xenobiotic resistance found in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis by
Kurelec and Pivcevic (1991), and analogous to the phenomenon of
multi-drug resistance (MDR) found in mammalian tumor cell lines.
MDR was first discovered in cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy who were found to become simultaneously insensitive
to a wide range of structurally unrelated, cytotoxic drugs (Beck,
1987. Hofli and Nissen-Meyer, 1990). The clinical resistance to these
drugs, marked by a decrease in drug accumulation within the tumor
cells, was found to correspond to an increased expression of a 170 kD
membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Pearce, 1990). The P-gp was later
found to bind and export a wide array of compounds from the cell in
an energy-dependent, saturable process (Pearce, 1990).
Previous research has shown that certain drugs reverse the
MDR activity in tumor cells (Hofsli and Nissen-Meyer, 1990). This
observation has led to the discovery that certain compounds will
competitively inhibit the efflux of other compounds from cells with
P-glycoprotein. Hence the latter compounds will accumulate in the
cell and, in effect, the cell is no longer resistant to them. Such MDR
inhibitors include verapamil (Yusa and Tsuruo, 1989), forskolin
MDR in Mytilus; Bard and Cornwall, 1992; 2
