(Morris et al., 1991), quinidine (Cornwell et al., 1987), emetine
(Samuelson et al., 1990), vinblastine (Tamai and Safa, 1991), and
trifluoperazine (Cano-Gauci and Riordan, 1987), among many others.
This competitive inhibition phenomenon has been used to detect
MDR activity.
Neyfakh (1988) found that multi-drug resistant tumor cells
under normal conditions resisted staining by a number of fluorescent
dyes. However, the cells accumulated high concentrations of the
dyes in the presence of known inhibitors of MDR, such as verapamil,
trifluoperazine, and weak detergents. This information was used to
develop an assay to observe and characterize MDR-like activity: a
marked increase in accumulation of rhodamine in the presence of
MDR inhibitors, as measured by fluorescence microscopy, may signify
the presence of an MDR-like mechanism.
We modified this assay for our study of Mytilus sp., using
epifluorescence microscopy to measure rhodamine B accumulation in
single cells of intact Mytilus sp. gill tissue in vivo. The purpose of
this study is to determine if the marine mussels Mytilus
californianus and Mytilus edulis exhibit an efflux mechanism similar
to the multi-drug resistance phenomenon described in mammalian
tumor cells, and to determine if this mechanism could be effective
against the low concentrations of toxins found in the aquatic
environment.
Four pieces of evidence suggest that the Mytilus possesses an
MDR-like mechanism to efflux xenobiotics and avoid bioaccumulation
of these toxins. First, accumulation of rhodamine B in the gill tissue
is sensitive to known inhibitors of the MDR protein, such as
MDR in Mytilus; Bard and Cornwall, 1992; 3
