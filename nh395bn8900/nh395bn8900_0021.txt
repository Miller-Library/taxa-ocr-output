tissues were incubated for one hour in high, varying concentrations
of rhodamine with and without 22 uM verapamil. Fluorescence
represented as raw data. Data reported as mean fluorescences with
standard deviations. Percent differences are indicated above each
point.
Eigure 9. Efflux pump inhibition model. (a) Under normal conditions,
diffusion and an efflux pump work together to decrease intracellulai
rhodamine concentration. (b) With the efflux pump inhibited, as in
the presence of verapamil, diffusion is the only major force driving
the rhodamine out, so intracellular rhodamine concentration
decreases at a slower rate.
Eigure 10. Problems with high rhodamine concentrations. (a) When
rhodamine diffusion and MDR efflux are on the same order of
magnitude, the inhibition of the efflux pump is noticeable. (b) When
the original rhodamine concentration is increased and verapamil is
added, the initial (Time = 0) intracellular rhodamine concentration is
greatly increased. Thus the concentration gradient driving
rhodamine out of the cells in the rinse is on a higher order of
magnitude than the MDR efflux pump. Therefore, inhibition of the
efflux pump is not as noticeable.
