verapamil. Second, verapamil inhibits an efflux pump. Third,
western blot analysis shows the presence of a protein
immunologically related and similar in molecular weight to the
mammalian MDR transport protein. Finally, the Mytilus sp. efflux
pump is sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of rhodamine B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MDR ACTIVITY DETECTION ASSAYS
MDR activity was measured in Mytilus sp. gill tissue. Gills were
removed from freshly dissected Mytilus californianus and Mytilus
edulis. The gills are comprised of four monolayer sheets of cells.
Small (« 25 mm2), single cell layer tissue samples were cut from the
dorsal and ventral rims of the medial layer of the gill. The gills of M.
edulis had to be incubated in sea water for 10-15 minutes to flush
out the large amounts of mucus.
To assess MDR substrate competition, seven 5mL sea water
solutions were prepared in 30mL beakers with 1 uM rhodamine B
and one each of the following MDR-inhibiting drugs at the following
concentrations: verapamil (22 uM), emetine (40 ug/mL), vinblastine
(50ug/mL), forskolin (5 uM), trifluoperazine (22 uM), quinidine (22
UM), and sodium azide (10 mM). The control solution contained 1
MM rhodamine B only. Two tissue samples were incubated in each
solution at 18-20 °C for one hour. The tissues were then removed
from the incubation and swirled gently in 10-20 mL sea water for a
