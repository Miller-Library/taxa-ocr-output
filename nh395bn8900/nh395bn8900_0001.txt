ABSTRACT
Marine mussels Mytilus californianus and Mytilus edulis, hardy
invertebrates resistant to pollution, were found to possess a multi¬
xenobiotic resistance mechanism analogous to multi-drug resistance
(MDR) found in resistant mammalian tumor cell lines. This MDR-like
efflux pump may provide defense against natural toxins in the
aquatic environment. An assay using the fluorescent dye rhodamine
B was adapted to measure MDR activity in Mytilus sp. gill tissue in
vivo. Four pieces of evidence support the existence of a multi¬
xenobiotic resistance in Mytilus sp.: (1) accumulation of rhodamine B
is sensitive to known inhibitors of MDR, such as verapamil; (2)
verapamil inhibits an efflux pump; (3) Western blot analysis shows
the presence of a protein immunologically related and similar in
molecular weight to mammalian MDR P-glycoprotein; and (4) the
Mytilus sp. efflux pump is sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of
rhodamine B.
