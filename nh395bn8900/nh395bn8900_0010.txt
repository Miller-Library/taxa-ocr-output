MDR-LIKE ACTIVITY IN OTHER ORGANISMS
A preliminary survey of MDR-like activity in other marine
organisms was conducted. Eggs of the sand crab Emerita analoga and
the solitary tunicate Ascidia ceratodes exhibited a 200% increase in
rhodamine accumulation in the presence of verapamil. No increase
in rhodamine accumulation on addition of verapamil was detected in
eggs of the following species, Aplysia californica (sea hare), Patiria
miniata (bat star), and Pisaster ochraceus (purple sea star).
Eggs of Parastichopus parvimenesis (California sea cucumber)
were incubated in rhodamine solutions containing verapamil,
emetine, trifluoperazine, quinidine, sodium azide and forskolin.
Rhodamine accumulation in the presence of these drugs was 20% and
40% below that of the control.
We found no evidence for the MDR P-glycoprotein on the
Western blot for any of the aforementioned species (all tested except
Aplysia eggs).
DISCUSSION
From the results of the rhodamine assays and Western Blot
analysis, we conclude that the marine mussels, Mytilus californianus
and Mytilus edulis, possess an MDR-like mechanism which may
provide defense against toxins in the aquatic environment.
