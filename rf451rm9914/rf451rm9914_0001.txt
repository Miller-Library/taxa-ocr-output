Abstract
Videotape footage taken on remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives from
03/09/89 to 05/14/91 was used to examine the distribution and behavior of the upper
mesopelagic shrimp Sergestes similis in Monterey Bay. A quantitative method of
determining relative density was developed and used to show that the abundance of
S. similis is significantly higher at a site in the vicinity of the Monterey Canyon wall as
compared to one mile from the wall. Vertical distribution of the dielly migrating
shrimp also appears to shift upward with the slope of the canyon. Studies with
horizontal transects showed densities at 100 m from the wall not to significantly differ
from those in the water column. However, density increased significantly within 50 m
of the wall to a highest relative value at the water column/slope interface. Behaviora
studies showed S. similis to play a role in the trophic structure of the slope benthic
community. Overall, canyon topography was determined to have important
influence on S. similis distribution and behavior.
