Table Legends
Table 1.
Depth Increment Totals for All Dive Descents at C4-CS Site and H9O Column Site.
"Mean Calculated Range Density" is the average value of the f sergestids/ min density
calculated for each dive in that depth range. "Highest" - "Lowest Range Density'
gives the range of values drawn in black in Figure 6.
Table 2.
Data for Examining Vertical Patchiness. Column 4 is graphed in Figure 8. The first 23
dives listed are from the H90 Column site. The last 15 dives are from C4-CS. The
final column is the total 4 sergestids sighted / the greatest depth reached by the ROV
for each dive.
Table 3 (a & b).
Raw Data for Horizontal Transects Paralleling the Canyon Wall at 100 m Off and at the
HoO Column Site in the Center of the Canyon. This shows sergestid counts, f min in
transit, and densities for a total of 24 transects.
Table 4.
Overall Totals for Horizontal Transects Paralleling the Canyon Wall at 100 m Off vs. At
the H9O Column Site in the Center of the Canyon. The density totals from this table
are graphed in Figure 15.
Table 5.
Overall Totals for Horizontal Transects Perpendicular to the Canyon Wall. These
results are graphed in black in Figure 10.
Table 6.
Totals for Horizontal Transects Perpendicular to the Canyon Wall Split into Two Depth
Ranges. Transects were separated into those at depths 340-420 m and 420-510 m.
Results are graphically compared in Figure 10.
Table 7.
Overall Data for Night Dives. The final column (Overall) gives either the total or
X, the average, for the two night dives made at the HÂ»O Column site. The dive on
03/09/89 took place three days after new moon, and the dive on 03/22/89 occurred
two days after full moon.
Table 8.
Totals for Observations of Interactions of S. similis with Benthic Organisms. This totals
the observations listed in Appendix 4.
Table 9.
Noted Instances of S. similis Foraging/Scavenging Behavior. All noted sergestid
sightings 03/09/89 -05/14/91 were considered. These are the best examples of
apparent scavenging in detritus.
