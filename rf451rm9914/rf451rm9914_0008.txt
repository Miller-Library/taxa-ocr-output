Discussion
In situ observations are difficult to interpret for crustaceans because they are
photosensitive and capable of rapid escape from or of being attracted to a
submersible (Mackie, 1985). In assessing the results of the distributional and
behavioral studies, such biases as the light, noise, and leading "bow wave" of the
ROV must be kept in mind (Bowers, 1988). In distributional studies, bias was
reduced by counting sergestids only while in transit at a speed fast enough to keep
them from being attracted to the RÖV. In ethological studies, bias was reduced by
excluding observations of behavior when the sergestids were obviously disoriented by
or attracted to the RÖV light.
Distribution
Previous studies of Sergestes similis depth distribution off Oregon and
southern California place the species at approximately 250-600 m during the day and
0-200 m at night (Omori & Gluck, 1979; Judkins & Fleminger, 1972). Krygier &
Pearcy (1981) found S. similis most abundant off Oregon in 200-300 m, followed by
300-400 m. Overall depth increment densities for the dives in this study place the
highest abundance of sergestids in the 300-400 m range in Monterey Bay. At night
off Oregon, Pearcy & Forss (1966) had the highest catches of S. similis in the uppei
50 m, with some below 150 m (1969). Because only two night dives were made by the
ROV, no general trends can be inferred, although the greatest number of individuals
was seen at about 100 m depth, correlating with others research.
Although there may be some regional differences in the vertical distribution
of a single species due to such factors as temperature or light penetration (Flock,
1989), it appears the observations made with the ROV put the S. similis population
of Monterey Bay in generally the same range as off Oregon and southern California.
The entire depth distribution can not be adequately characterized, however, because
the ROV was unable to reach depths greater than 520 m. As shown in Figures 4 & 5,
dives often ended in the midst of the sergestid population. And although Barham
noted an upward change in depth of the Monterey Bay scattering layer with seasonal
upwelling, no seasonal changes in depth distribution are obvious from the dives
studied.
Although not statistically significant (possibly due to small sample size), the
apparent difference in vertical distribution at the C4-CS and H9O Column sites
indicates a "meniscus effect" likely influenced by canyon topography. In examining
Figure 6, it appears the population at the C4-CS site is shifted up about 50 m; the
highest density for the C4-CS site was in the 300-350 m increment, while at the H2O
Column site, highest density was at 350-400 m (Table 1). An upward population shift
at the wall site could be due to sergestids caught in shallower water during their daily
migration. Tsukai (1985) observed a related species, Sergia lucens, at 250 m near
bottom on the slope of Sagami Bay and at 300-350 m in midwater. Raymont (1983)
notes that upwelling and a steep slope may bring organisms closer to the surface, and
Marshall & Merrett (1977) report the depth distribution of mesopelagic organisms
may well be modified by proximity of the bottom over a continental slope.
In terms of general vertical patchiness, it appears qualitatively that S. similis is
more dispersed at the H90 Column site (compare Figures 4 & 5). One would expect
that vertically migrating organisms caught over a shallower slope such as the C4-C5
