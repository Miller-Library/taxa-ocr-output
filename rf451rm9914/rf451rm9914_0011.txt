(Omori and Hamner, 1982), was noted for about three individuals at a time (Table
10), yet even when three individuals were "schooling," all other organisms in the
vicinity were oriented randomly. And although other researchers have noted S.
similis in dense swarms exceeding 20 individuals/ m2(Omori, 1974; Raymont, 1983),
no true swarms (as often observed for euphausiids) were observed for S. similis on
the over 100 dives examined.
A last interesting characteristic of S. similis to note is its descent speed. The
speed calculated from the ROV videotapes, 0.075 m/s, is strikingly similar to that
determined by Barham in the laboratory, 0.08 m/s (1957).
Summary
In the final analysis, it appears that the topography of the Monterey Canyon
plays an important role in influencing the distribution and behavior of S. similis on
both the meso and fine scale. The resources of MBARI and the video capabilities of
the ROV have illustrated a better picture of S. similis ecology in Monterey Bay.
Several interesting questions remain. Is there an active preference of the
canyon wall habitat by an S. similis population? Are the sergestids aggregating near
bottom for the food source or are they there as a result of currents running up
through the canyon interacting with vertical migration ranges? Is the actual
percentage of organisms that vertically migrate on a given night greater at the H20
Column site due to lack of benthopelagic feeding during the day? Are S. similis age
classes segregated in their distribution? Future research with the ROV may provide
answers.
