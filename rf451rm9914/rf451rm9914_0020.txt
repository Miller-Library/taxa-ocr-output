Appendix Legends
Appendix 1.
Raw Data for Each Dive Descent. This table shows all data obtained for 15
C4-C5 Site and 23 H9O Column Site dives 04/26/89 -05/07/91. For each depth
range, the total 4 of sergestids sighted is the top f, the total f min spent
in transit is the middle f, and the density calculated by f sergestids / min
is the bottom ft.
Appendix 2.
Overall Data Results Table for C4-CS and H9O Column Dives. Values from this
table are graphed in Figure 9.
Appendix 3.
Raw Data for Horizontal Transects Perpendicular to the Canyon Wall. This table
presents data for 26 transects. For each 10 m distance range from the wall,
the top 4 is the number of sergestids sighted, the middle f is the total f
min in transit, and the bottom f is density given by f sergestids/min.
Appendix 4.
Individual Observations of Interactions of S. similis with Benthic Organisms. All dives
03/09/89 - 05/14/91 were considered.
Appendix 5.
Close-up Observations Holding an Approximately 25 cm Screen Width. These
observations are biased by the apparent attraction of S. similis to ROV lights.
