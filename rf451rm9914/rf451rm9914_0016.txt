Figure 1.
Map of the Monterey Bay Canyon Illustrating ROV Dive Sites. Six sites were used for
observations of S. similis.
Figure 2.
Depth vs. Time Plot of First Sergestid Sightings for All Dives 03/20/89-02/28/91.
The plot was made to see if ROV observations tended to correspond to diel vertical
migration of S. similis. The plot also shows a linear regression and correlation
coefficient for the data.
Figure 3.
Salinity vs. Depth Plot and Temperature vs. Depth Plot for CA-C and H9O Column
Sites on Consecutive Days. The plots were made from the ROV's CTD data on
05/06/91 (C4-C5 Site) and 05/07/91 (H90 Column Site).
Figure 4.
Sergestes similis Depth Distribution as Determined by Sightings During ROV Descent:
C4-CS Site. The plot shows the presence and relative abundance of S.
similis as determined by number per screen for 15 dives 06/27/89-05/06/91. Greatest
depth reached by the ROV is also indicated.
Figure 5.
Sergestes similis Depth Distribution as Determined by Sightings During ROV Descent:
HoO Column Site. A plot (compare to Figure 4) for 23 dives 04/26/89- 05/07/91.
Figure 6.
Bar Graph of Depth Increment Density Totals for H90 Column vs. CA-C5 Site. Density
is expressed as the number of S. similis sighted per number of minutes of transit time.
Colored bars show total t of sergestids observed/ total f min spent in that increment
for all dives. X, the mean of the densities calculated for each depth increment for
each dive is given by the extended bar.
Figure 7.
Frequency Distribution of Overall Density for C4-CS vs. H9O Column Dives. Overall
density for each dive is calculated as the total it sergestids sighted / total f min of
descent time. Greatest depth reached for each dive is not taken into account for this
histogram.
Figure 8.
Vertical Patchiness as Determined by Number of S. similis Sighted Per Depth Range of
Sightings. To obtain a value for "depth range of sightings," the shallowest depth was
subtracted from the greatest depth at which a sergestid was sighted. The graph shows
the density in f sergestids / m for 38 dives and shows the mean of patchiness density
values calculated for each site.

Comparison of Total Densities at H90 Column vs. C4-C Site. This graph shows:
