Acknowledgments
I would like to give special thanks to the crew of the Pt. Lobos who pilot and
launch the ROV. Thanks are also given to Lynn Lewis, Annette Gough, Debbie
Littlefield, Pat Tompkins, Marilyn Yuen, Hans Jannasch, and Dan Davis at MBARI
for helping me use the video equipment, understand the database, and learn various
computer techniques. Thanks are also given to Lisa Cooke for helping me narrow
down my procedure, to Emily Bell and Doug Stoner at Hopkins Marine Station for
helping me comprehend IBM statistics software, and to Alan Baldridge and the
Hopkins library staff.
Extra special thanks are given to Dr. Bruce Robison and Dr. Charles Baxter.
Robie and Chuck gave me the chance of a lifetime - to do science in the deep sea. I
appreciate all their help and advice and look forward to working with RÃ–Vs in the
future.
