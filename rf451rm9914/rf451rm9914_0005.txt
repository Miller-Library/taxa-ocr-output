Distribution
38 ROV descents at the C4-CS and H9O Column sites from 04/26/89 to
05/07/91 were reviewed. The number of Sergestes similis and the number of minutes
spent in transit for each depth increment for each dive and for the dive overall are
presented in Appendix 1 along with the calculated density in Sergs/min. Figures 4 &
5 show the S. similis vertical distribution as determined by number per video screen
for the C4-CS and H9O Column sites, respectively. The dives are plotted separately
by month, but no seasonal changes in distribution are readily apparent. Sergestids
were sighted above 200 m depth on only one C4-CS dive - 05/06/91 and three H2O
Column Dives - 06/15/89, 07/16/90, and 07/23/90. Only one dive at each site extended
below 500 m.
Overall densities for each depth increment for each site are presented in Table
1 and graphed in Figure 6. Overall density in Sergs/min was calculated for each
depth increment at each site in two ways: as a ratio of the total + sergestids sighted
total + min for all dives and as the mean of the depth increment densities calculated
for each individual dive. The mean density value is used in statistical comparisons.
The three highest depth increment densities, » 30 Sergs/min, occurred at the C4-Cs
site in the 250-300, 300-350, and 350-400 m increments. The overall densities of
these three depth increments also proved to be significantly higher at the C4-C5 site
at the .01 level (Table 13). No significant difference in density between the two sites
was observed for the other depth increments. Differences in mean density values
between depth increments at each individual site were not significant except for
between the 200-250 and 250-300 m increments at C4-CS, significant at the .05 level.
As shown in Figure 6, the overall densities for each depth increment at each
site appear to follow a bell-shaped curve with maximum for the C4-CS site in the 300.
350 m increment, at 9.333 Sergs/min, and maximum for the H2O Column site in the
350-400 m increment, at 0.983 Sergs/min. Taking all 38 dives collectively, the highest
density, 3.453 Sergs/min, occurs in the 350-400 m increment. Over all depths, the
mean density at C4-CS was 4.323 Sergs/min in comparison to 0.736 at the H»O
Column site (Figure 9). A frequency distribution of overall dive densities (Figure 7)
shows the H9O Column site dives have a much greater probability of having a low
number of sergestid sightings per descent.
Density in terms of + S. similis sighted per depth range of sightings was also
significantly greater at the C4-CS site (1.008 vs. 0.237 Sergs/m) at the .01 level. This
"vertical patchiness" density is reported for each dive in Table 2 and graphed in
Figure 8. The average depth range of sergestid sightings was similar at the two sites,
but the average number of sergestids sighted per dive was 145.53 at C4-CS vs. 25.13
at H9O Column, an order of magnitude difference (Appendix 2). The greatest
"vertical patchiness" density value, 5.116 Sergs/m, came from the 12/20/89 dive at C4-
C in which 566 sergestids were sighted over 110 m. Not surprisingly, this dive alse
had the highest overall density in terms of Sergs/min, 14.15, and the highest value for
+ Sergs/greatest depth of dive, 1.433 (Table 2). Density given by the average
number of sergestids sighted / the average greatest dive depth at each site was also
six times higher at C4-CS: 0.353 vs 0.059 Sergs/m (Appendix 2). Overall values for
densities calculated in all three ways are shown for each site in Figure 9.
