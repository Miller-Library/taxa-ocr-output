was split into ten 10 m increments. Distance to the wall was read off sonar and
recorded on the audiotrack for the videotape. The number of S. similis sighted and
the time spent moving in each distance increment was noted and used to calculate
relative density as above.
Behavior
All database citations of sergestids from approximately 100 dives were
reviewed to examine behavioral patterns. Sergestes similis was observed for benthic
interactions such as touching, darting away from, or being captured by benthic
organisms and for apparent scavenging in the benthic detritus. Sergestids were also
observed when the RÖV held an approximately 25 cm screen-width view of the
bottom. Instances of apparent schooling and swarming were also recorded and
noted for proximity to the slope bottom. The speed of S. similis was calculated
several times by taking the ratio of the change in RÖV depth to the change in tape
time code as the ROV followed an organism’s descent.
Statistical Tests
Statistical tests for differences between mean densities for most of the
distributional data sets included standard parametric two-tailed t tests and
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. The two-sample t test assumes that both
samples come at random from normal populations with equal variances. Although
the two-tailed t test is robust enough to withstand considerable departure from
assumptions, the Mann-Whitney test may be much more powerful for those data sets
with smaller sample sizes (Zar, 1984).
