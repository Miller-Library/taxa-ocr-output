screen viewing width of approximately 25 cm were made on 4 dives. With this screen
width, many were observed simply skimming over the bottom, and 43 of 46 sergestids
to actually touch the bottom darted off (Appendix 5).
Out of the 100 dives analyzed, only six instances of sergestid schooling
behavior from 5 dives were noted (Table 10), and only three instances of what may
be considered swarms of S. similis were observed (Table 11). The largest "school"
consisted of four individuals swimming horizontally, and the highest density observed
for a "swarm" was greater than 100 sergestids per videoscreen with a wide angle
camera setting. All but one instance of schooling and swarming were within sight of
the benthos.
Descent speeds calculated for S. similis ranged from 0.04 to 0.105 m/s, with an
average of 0.075 m/s (Table 12). These speeds were measured at the H2O Column
site at various depths between 320 and 425 m. Although S. similis generally appeared
to have a random orientation both near the bottom and in the water column,
sergestids in the water column were often observed descending vertically.
