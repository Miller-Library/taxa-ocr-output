Table 10.
Noted Instances of S. similis Schooling Behavior. All noted sergestid sightings
03/09/89 - 05/14/91 were considered. These are the best examples of what may be
considered schooling, all near-bottom.
Table 11.
Highest Noted Relative Densities of S. similis. All sergestid sightings from 03/09/89-
05/14/91 were considered. The three listed observations had the video camera set for
wide angle viewing, as in all transects reported.
Table 12.
Descent Speeds Calculated for S. similis. These speeds were calculated by noting
change in depth reading on the ROV/change in time.
Table 13.
Results of Two-Sample, Two-Tailed t Tests. Comparisons were made between mean
densities for depth increments at the C4-CS and H9O Column sites, between mean
densities for horizontal transects paralleling the wall and at the H9O Column site, and
between mean densities for distance ranges up to 70 m from the wall for horizontal
transects perpendicular to the wall.
Table 14.
Results of Two-Sample, Two-Tailed Mann-Whitney Tests. Selected comparisons made
with t tests were repeated with this robust nonparametric test.
