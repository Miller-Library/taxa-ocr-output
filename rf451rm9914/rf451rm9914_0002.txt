Introduction
Sergestes similis Hansen 1903 is a major component of the upper mesopelagic
community of the North Pacific, ranging from Japan through the Bering Sea to the
Gulf of California (Krygier & Wasmer, 1988; Milne, 1968). Found off California in
Monterey Bay first in 1921 (Schmitt, 1921), it is one of the main species correlated
with the deep scattering layers in Monterey Bay (Barham, 1957). Sergestes similis has
an average length of 40 mm and is readily identified by its long antennae and red
abdomen (Omori, 1974). It matures in its first or second year and has a life span of
1-3 years (Nybakken, 1988; Omori, 1974). It spawns in Monterey Bay generally in
December-January and June-July (Vernberg, 1983; Omori, 1974).
Sergestes similis is classified as a strong vertical migrator (Pearcy et al., 1977),
ascending to within 50 m of the surface at night and descending to approximately 500
m by day (Judkins, 1972; Omori & Gluck, 1979). Rarely does it descend below 1000
m (Krygier & Pearcy, 1981). Although described as a "truly holoplanktonic" decapod
by Raymont (1983), S. similis may interact with the benthos due to the topography of
the Monterey Submarine Canyon. Öften, contact between midwater migrants and
the seafloor occurs on steep slopes where the depth is shallower than the usual range
of diel migration (Isaacs & Schwartzlose, 1965; Ömori & Ohta, 1981). Raymont
(1983) reports for S. similis that biomass is large in regions of upwelling with a steeply
sloping bottom, two characteristics of Monterey Bay.
A major problem in assessing micronekton distribution is patchiness, the
aggregation of individuals that may be caused by physical or ecological processes or
by behavioral phenomena (Hamner, 1988; Omori, 1983; Haury et al., 1978).
Patchiness on the fine-scale (meters to hundreds of meters), the ability of sergestids
to avoid nets, and the inability of nets to sample near-bottom all act to obscure
results of past studies on S. similis distribution (Robison, 1982; Omori, 1974). To
better examine the population of S. similis in the Monterey Canyon and its
interactions with the slope benthos, a visual study was conducted with a remotely
operated vehicle (ROV) owned by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI). Using a quantitative method developed to calculate relative densities, the
S. similis population near the canyon wall was compared to a site a mile more toward
the center of the canyon. The ROV also allowed for an in situ behavioral study of S.
similis. Benthic interactions as well as other behavioral characteristics of S. similis
were observed to note any influence of canyon topography on behavior.
