Vertical distribution of S. similis at night was at much shallower depths
(Figure 11). Five of twelve sightings of single organisms were in the upper 100 m
(Figure 14). One sergestid was sighted at 286 m. In Sergs/min, the density at the
H9O Column site at night was an order of magnitude lower than during the day
(Table 7, Figure 12). No statistical tests were conducted because only two night dives
were made.
Abundance of S. similis at 100 m from the canyon wall was compared to that
at the H9O Column site using horizontal transect results. Table 3 lists data for each
individual transect, and Table 4 shows the results for the transects overall and split
into two depth increments, 300-400 and 400-500 m. The average density results for
transects at the H9O Column site were first compared to those observed in the 300
500 m range during H90 Column dive descents and were found statistically to be the
same (Table 14). Although Figure 13 shows the density for H2Ã– Column transects
higher than for those paralleling the wall in each depth increment and overall, no
significant difference was observed between the mean densities (nor between mean
densities of the two depth increments at each individual site). Densities at the H20
Column site had the greatest range (0-11.321 Sergs/min) and eight of seventeen H2C
Column transects had no sergestid sightings (in comparison to two of seven transects
100 m from the wall).
Data for each of the 26 horizontal transects conducted perpendicular to the
wall are shown in Appendix 3. Twenty-five transects reached to 50 m and 7 reached
to 100 m from the wall. It appears qualitatively that the density of S. similis is
greatest at the canyon wall, reaches its lowest value at 50 m from the wall, and then
increases again to a second peak in the 70-80 m increment (Table 5, Figure 10).
Values for distances greater than 60 m are not, however, statistically manageable due
to sample size. Mean densities of distance increments up to 60 m from the wall were
compared, and a significant difference was found between the following distance
increments: 0-10 and 30-40 m, 0-10 and 40-50 m, and 20-30 and 40-50 m (Tables 13
& 14). Density values for the 90-100 m distance increment were combined with
those from transects paralleling the wall and found not to be statistically different
from density values at H90 Column site dives in the 300-500 m depth range (Table
14). The transects perpendicular to the wall were also split into two depth
increments of 340-420 and 420-510 m (Table 6). Although the densities are always
higher at the shallower depth increment (Figure 10), no significant differences in
densities between depth increments were observed.
Behavior
Ten dives from 03/28/89 to 09/24/90 at 4 sites had video footage of S. similis
interacting with benthic organisms (Appendix 4). Organisms touched varied from
crabs to holothurians to starfish. The greatest number of observed interactions were
with starfish, yet many of these close-up observations may be biased by attraction to
ROV lights. The number of sergestids to dart away from an organism touched was
noted, and 97 of 110 occurrences of touching a benthic organism were followed by
the darting "reflex" (Table 8). A starfish, sea anemone, and benthic fish were
observed capturing a total of five sergestids (Table 8). Five instances of sergestids
that appeared to be foraging among the benthic detritus were observed from two
dives at the North Wall and C4-C5 sites. In each case, the sergestid was calm, not
darting away from the benthos (Table 9). Observations of S. similis made with a
