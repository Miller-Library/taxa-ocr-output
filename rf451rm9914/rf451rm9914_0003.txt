Materials and Methods
Sergestes similis were recorded on betacam videotape footage taken by a DXC
3000 Sony Camera mounted on the ROV during dives from 03/09/89 to 05/14/91. All
tapes are annotated in a database for sightings of various organisms, including
sergestids. Each video frame is time-coded and correlated to hydrographic and
navigational data from the RÖV, including depth, salinity, temperature, and 09
Sergestes similis was observed at six dive sites in Monterey Bay (Figure 1).
Distribution
The two sites used to study S. similis vertical distribution were the C4-CS site,
located in the vicinity of the canyon wall with bottom depth approximately 500 m,
and the H9O Column site, approximately one mile from the wall site toward the
center of the canyon with bottom depth approximately 1000 m. Out of 80 dives, 38
were chosen to examine vertical distribution. Only those dives correlated with
hydrographic data and descending at similar times were examined. (As shown in
Figure 2, the fact that S. similis vertically migrates had to be taken into account.)
Using the videotapes and database, the number of S. similis sighted and the amount
of time spent by the ROV in transit with a wide angle camera setting was determined
for each specified depth increment for 15 C4-CS and 23 H9O Column dive descents.
Two night dives at the H9O Column site were also reviewed. Depth increments were
0-25, 25-100, 100-200, 200-250, 250-300, 300-350, 350-400, 400-450, 450-500, and 500
550 m. (At depths above 25 m, most of the time is spent launching or recovering the
ROV; thus the 25-100 m increment gives a more accurate picture of the upper 100
m.) Also noted for each dive descent were the greatest depth reached by the ROV
and the shallowest and greatest depth at which a sergestid was sighted. The ROV
did not exceed a depth of 520 m. Plots of relative abundance by depth as determined
by number of sergestids per videoscreen were prepared for each dive.
Relative density was calculated for each depth increment for each dive by
dividing the number of S. similis sighted by the number of minutes in transit. Density
in 4 sergestids/min (Sergs/min) was calculated for each dive overall and for each site
at each depth increment. The calculation procedure assumes that when the ROV is
moving with camera set for a wide angle view, the volume observed is sufficiently
similar at different times to compare densities using frequency of occurrence. The
method also assumes the sample size of observations is large enough to compensate
for differences in the speed of the ROV at different times. Relative density for each
dive and each site was also expressed as a ratio of the number of sergestids sighted to
the range of the depths at which sergestids were sighted (called "vertical patchiness
density") and as a ratio of the number of sergestids sighted to the greatest depth
reached by the RÖV. Each of these ratios have units in Sergs/m.
Relative density of S. similis near the canyon wall and at the H2O Column site
was also compared by conducting horizontal transects for varying lengths of time at
depths between 300-500 m on 11 dives. Seven transects paralleling the canyon wall
at 100 m from the wall (determined by sonar) and 17 transects at the H2O Column
site were completed. The depth, time, number of sergestids sighted, and time spent
in transit were noted for each transect, and density was calculated in Sergs/min.
Horizontal transects were also conducted perpendicular to the canyon wall to
examine changes in sergestid density within 100 m of the wall. Distance to the wall
