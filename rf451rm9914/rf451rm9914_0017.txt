overall density in sergestids/min for dives at each site over all depths, the mean f of
sergestids/ the mean greatest depth reached by the ROV per dive at each site, and the
mean f sergestids / mean depth range of sightings per dive at each site.
Figure 10.
Comparison of S. similis Density in Distance Increments from the Canyon Wall. This
graphs the results of 26 horizontal transects made perpendicular to the wall (up to 100
m from the wall). The shaded region shows results for all transects at all depths. The
transects are also separated into two depth ranges (340-420 and 420-510 m) and
graphed for further comparison.
Figure 11.
Line Graph of Depth Increment Density Totals for Day vs. Night Dives. Density, given
by total 4 sergestids / total min, is plotted for the CA-CS and H9O Column site day
dives and for the H9O Column site night dives. Night dive results come from two
dives in March 1989.
Figure 12.
Comparison of Total Densities at H90 Column Site: Day vs. Night Dives. (This figure
is constructed like Figure 10.) Night dive results come from two dives in March 1989.
Figure 13.
Comparison of Horizontal Transects Paralleling the Canyon Wall at 100 m Off vs. At
the H9O Column Site in the Center of the Canyon. The graph shows overall density
results for all transects as well as results for the transects split into two depth ranges
(300-400 and 400-500 m). Located under Table 4.

Night Dives at H9O Column Site. A plot (compare to Figure 4) for two night dives
03/09/89 and 03/22/89. Located with Table 7.
