INTRODUCTION
Annelids are well known for their capacity to regenerate
missing parts (Berrill, 1951; Abeloos, 1955). Some worms
are not only capable of regenerating new anterior and posterior
ends but they also undergo fission and employ this ability to
multiply asexually. This occurs in the genera <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Filograna : Exact'>Filograna</span> and
Salmacina of the family <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Serpulidae : Exact'>Serpulidae.</span> These two genera are
closely related; Filograna has an operculum, while an operculum
is lacking in Salmacina. Though Hartman (1969) has treated
Salmacina as a separate genus, numerous other authorities such
as Gee (1963), Day (1967), and Nelson-Smith (1967) treat
jalmacina as a subgenus of Filograna.
Regeneration and asexual reproduction have been studied by
Cresp (1964) in the European species <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Salmacina incrustans : Exact'>Salmacina incrustans</span> (Clap.).
Cresp has shown that when Salmacina is cut in halves it is
capable of regenerating both anteriorly and posteriorly. In
addition, the worms reproduce by transverse fission in the ab-
dominal region and undergo subsequent regeneration.
Berrill (1931), Berrill and Mees (1936), and others cited in
Berrill and Mees (1936) (Okada (1932), and Gross and Huxley (1935)
had previously shown that in regeneration of sabellids and
serpulids cut in the abdominal region, regeneration by the anter-
ior half is a relatively simple process. It involves formation
of a new pygidial region and later addition of new abdominal
segments in the normal manner. Regeneration by the posterior
half, however, is more complex; this involves the growth of two
or three new anterior segments followed by the reorganization of
a number of existing abdominal segments into thoracic segments.
The process is more one of metamorphosis than of regeneration.
Such a transformation of abdominal into thoracic segments must
occur in asexual reproduction is <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>S. incrustans,</span> but Cresp (1964)
does not include any of the details of abdominal reorganization
and it is not clear just how reconstitution of the new thorax
takes place.

<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Salmacina tribranchiata : Exact'>Salmacina tribranchiata</span> (Moore, 1923) is abundant in the
shallow waters of Monterey Bay. Studies of asexual repro¬
duction in this species were conducted at Hopkins Marine
Station of Stanford University in April and May, 1976, with
the purpose of comparing events here with those in S. incrustans
and of clarifying the process by which new thoraxes were formed
in posterior reorganization. Subsidiary observations relating
to systematics and rate of tube growth were also made.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Clusters of tubes of S. incrustans several inches across
were collected at thirty foot depths in the kelp <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>(Macrocystis)</span>
beds off Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. They
were maintained in good condition in running seawater aquaria
at temperatures of 12-15° C. Individual worms were extracted
from their tubes by leaving portions of a colony overnight in
stagnant seawater at room temperature. Under the mildly hypoxic
conditions generated the worms left their tubes in large numbers.
This method was preferred to anesthetizing the worms in magnesium
chloride, and then removing them, due to a high mortality rate
which resulted from the latter procedure. The extracted worms
were then maintained in finger bowls placed in running seawater.
All observations reported were made on living worms mounted on
slides and observed under a compound microscope.
TAXONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Hartman (1969) and Blake (1975) in their respective keys to
California polychaetes, identify <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>S. tribranchiata</span> as a non-
operculate serpulid. However, the taxonomic description by
Hartman (1969, p. 771) includes a diagram, by Fauvel (1927), of
a swollen branchial filament tip from S. incrustans, described by
Hartman as an operculum. Though several thousand specimens of
S. tribranchiata were examined in this study, no operculum or
swollen tentacle tip was observed.
Taxonomic descriptions of S. tribranchiata (Figure 1) are
not consistent either: Berkeley et al. (1952) reported five to
eight thoracic segments, while Hartman (1969) states there are
Asexual Reproduction in Salmacina

eight. In contrast to these observations, it was found in this
study that the number of thoracic segments varied between eight and
eleven with a modal value of nine (Table 1). All segments
bearing setae were counted as chaetigers, including the peri¬
stomial segment with its characteristic collar setae. A larger
variance was observed for the number of abdominal segments.
Hartman (1969) reported that the number varied from twenty-four
to twenty-seven, while in this study the number of setigerous
abdominal segments ranged from fourteen to thirty-three with a
modal value of eighteen (Figure 2). Neither the pygidium nor the
unsetigerous region immediately posterior to the thorax, which
is up to twice as long as the first abdominal segments, were
counted as segments.
MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION
S. tribranchiata has been reported to reproduce asexually
in a manner analogous to that of S. incrustans (see Hartman 1969).
In the present study it proved possible to divide the process of
fission and regeneration into a series of stages, each marked by
distinguishing features. The following stages are based on the
microscopic examination of several hundred worms removed from
their tubes.
Stage A. Worms in this stage have no clear indication of
imminent division. Some worms at this stage exhibit an opaque
region in the posterior portion of the abdomen, the region which,
in budding, will become the new worm and sometimes, in the
region anterior to the segment where fission will take place.
Stage B. The first indication of imminent budding consists
of constriction in a single whole segment posterior to the thorax
(Figure 3). The particular segment undergoing constriction varies,
ranging from the sixth abdominal chaetiger to the thirteenth
with a mode at segment seven (Figure 4). The appearance of red
pigment distributed transversely on the constricted setiger is
another characteristic of stage B. Of the individuals sampled
(Figure 4), ninety percent were observed with the red pigment.
Asexual Reproduction in Salmacina
Page 5
J. W. Peabody
The actual amount of pigment is highly variable.
Posterior to
the constricted segment, and sometimes anterior to it as well,
there is an opaque region as was found in stage A.
Stage C. There are two hallmarks of stage C: (a) The buds of
the primordial tentacles of the new individual appear dorsally
on both sides of the midline; (b) both capillary chaetae and
uncini are shed from the future prostomium, followed shortly by
their loss from the next posterior segment (the future collar
segment).
Stage D. <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Collar setae</span> begin to emerge just below the bud-
ding branchiae. As they elongate, their basal expansions become
more pronounced (see Berkeley et al., 1952, Fig. 268), and they
take on the appearance characteristic of mature collar setae.
The abdominal uncini on the first thoracic segment posterior to
the collar begin to disappear; as this occurs, or immediately
thereafter, the new notosetae on this segment appear. Already
evident on them is the bladed edge characteristic of thoracic
capillary setae.
General Aspects of Stages E-H. The conversion of the abdom-
inal chaetae into their thoracic counterparts proceeds in a reg¬
ular manner during the next four stages. The process initiated
in stage D continues until the conversion is complete: (a) the
old abdominal uncini fall off, (b) the new thoracic notosetae
appear, (c) the new uncini appear, and (d) the original capillary
setae are lost. The individual stages are discerned and defined
by the number of externally completed thoracic segments. Two
segments are completed in stage E, four in stage F, six in stage
G, and eight or nine in the final stage, H. The most salient
feature of this regular process is that both the abdominal neuro¬
setae and the thoracic notosetae can be observed at the same time
during reorganization. The new uncini appear slightly translocated
toward the ventral side relative to the position of the original
uncini. Furthermore, the new thoracic setae are added starting
at the ventral and progressing towards the dorsal side. Since
this process occurs on more than one segment at a time, a gradient
can be seen in the length of rows of new thoracic uncini, the ant¬
erior segments nearing completion of the conversion while the
Asexual Reproduction in Salmacina

posterior segments are initiating it. Finally, some behavioral
phenomena are characteristic of theselate stages. Violent con¬
tractions occur which are localized at the junction of the parent
and offspring. Independent movement increases as the connection
becomes tenuous, evidently facilitating separation.
Stage E. In this stage the bud has two completed thoracic
segments and at least one new abdominal segment has regenerated
in the parent. It is difficult in living animals to determine
exactly how many new abdominal segments are formed on the parent.
or whether a pygidial bud is formed first. The violent contrac-
tions mentioned above make it difficult to observe the connection
from the proper orientation, and the segments at the junction of
bud and parent are deeply recessed. The formation of new abdominal
segments on the parent continues in subsequent stages.
Stages F-H. The actual connection between parent and bud in
stages F-H presents another problem. The connection is no longer
simply through the prostomium but now is located peristomally in
the ventral portion of the collar. At this time it is difficult
to say if the ventral lobe of the collar has formed, though the
fact that it is undivided (unlike the dorsal collar) in the adult,
suggests that it does not develop completely until separation
occurs. The unnatural proximity of the dorsal lobes of the collar
is further support of an incomplete ventral collar,
Branchiae continue to elongate and pinnules begin to form; by
stages G and H, they are clearly visible along the axis of the
growing tentacle (not shown in Fig. 4, G and H). It is not until
separation of bud and parent that the pinnules spread apart.
Another development accompanies the reorganization of abdominal
chaetae during budding; as the tentacles become larger and as new
thoracic segments are externally completed, there is a corresponding
and parallel development of the collar. As it extends posteriorly
it forms the voluminous thoracic mantle. The growing collar is
pushed in abnormally relative to its configuration in an adult,
apparently due to the physical constraints of the junction between
parent and offspring, and it becomes more pronounced in the later
stages (Fig. 4, G and H).
The prostomium and peristomium grow out dorsally as the budding

worm elongates, as observed by Cresp (1964) in S. incrustans.
Consequently the offspring becomes increasingly separated from
the parent. Finally in stage H, the only connection appears to
be along the intestine. On one occasion material expelled from
the anus of a bud in stage G.
Once parent and bud are separated there is further development:
In the parent the pygidium forms a functional anus, and the former
connection to the bud seals leaving a prominent grey-white scar
just dorsal to the anus. Internally the thorax and abdomen com¬
plete their development in the offspring and as this occurs the
internal opaque tissue mass disappears.
Frequency of Occurrence of Stages A-H in Colonies. It seemed
desirable to time the rate of bud development, but individuals
removed from tubes (by any method) and individually maintained
in seawater containers did not thrive, nor did worms placed in
glass tubes. A more circuitous method was therefore used.
Several samples of colonies were isolated, the worms removed,
and each individual was classified according to the budding stage
to which it corresponded. The results are plotted as percentages
in Table 2. Stage I (following stage H) was added for newly budded
worms. If budding is asynchronous, if it goes on all the time,
and if the time spent in a particular stage is proportional to
the number of worms in that stage at a given moment then it is
possible to gain an idea of the relative duration of the stages.
Three-quarters of the animals examined were not budding at
all. Of the worms which were budding, those at stage B predom¬
inated, while the next two stages showed a marked decrease in
numbers. Relatively few individuals were observed in the final
stages.
To check the assumptions that budding was asynchronous and
aperiodic, samples of colonies were examined on different dates.
As is apparent from Table 2 there was no appreciable difference
between samples.
DISCUSSION
The stages outlined for S. tribranchiata cannot be compared
Asexual Reproduction in Salmacina
Page 8

in detail with events in S. incrustans, since details are not
available in Cresp (1964); nevertheless, the overall process
appears to be quite similar.
The replacement of old abdominal chaetae by new thoracic
chaetae follows a slightly different sequence than that reported
by Berrill (1931, p. 499) for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sabella pavonina : Exact'>Sabella pavonina.</span> He reports,
"The original setae and uncinigerous hooks in each segment drop
out as their bases and muscles atrophy, while at the same time
new setae and uncini appear..." This description appears to
differ from the step by step process observed in S. tribranchiata
In S. incrustans the process of setal replacement happened too
rapidly to be observed, according to Cresp (1964).
While the tabulation of numbers of individuals found at each
budding stage does not give absolute durations of the stages, it
does appear to provide information regarding the relative rates
of each stage. The relatively greater duration of stage B might
indicate that though very little change is observed externally,
internally there may be extensive alterations occurring. This
is supported by the observation that an opaque region develops
in the posterior portion of the parental abdomen just prior to
this stage. The rapidity with which the final stages E-H occur
concurs with the observations of Cresp (1964); he reports that
they happened too fast for him to record.
The possibility that asexual reproduction may show some
periodicity has not been ruled out since colony samples examined
represent a range of only four days. Lunar or seasonal variations
are not excluded.
Although visually the gut appears to be continuous up to
stage H, it is difficult to determine if there are any obstructions
along the internal passage, particularly at the junction of parent
and bud. The fact that material was extruded from the pygidium
by a bud in stage G certainly suggests a continuous gut. An
intact gut would permit the adult to continue feeding with possible
nutritional benefits to both the progenitor and bud, since feeding
could continue throughout the budding process.

TUBE GROWTH RATE
Tube growth rate was measured as a part of the study.
An intact colony which had been maintained in a laboratory
aquarium for two weeks was sprayed with a seawater jet to
remove detritus, and placed in a strong solution of methylene
blue and seawater for 3-4 hours. The water was cooled to
approximately ambient seawater temperature to prevent worms
from evacuating their tubes. Colonies were then returned to
normal seawater. New additions to the tubes (white) were
easily distinguished from older tubes (blue). At irregular
intervals new growth increments were measured with a dissecting
microscope and ocular micrometer. Results are shown in Figure 5
and Table 3.
There was one remarkable finding. If the mean values of tube
growth over the given time intervals are converted to their log,.
values and replotted, a nearly linear set of points emerges
with a correlation coefficient (r*) of 0.994 (Figure 6). A
comparison of the colony before and after staining affords a
possible explanation. After standing in the solution of methylene
blue the worms were kept in normal seawater where there was no
disturbance due to water flow or other animals (previously
removed with the jet of seawater), which live among the calcareous
tube masses. The possible effects of methylene blue on tube
growth represent another consideration. Further studies over
a longer period of time, with the proper controls to test these
factors, might afford some plausible explanation.
SUMMARY
1. The serpulid worm S. tribranchiata lacks an operculum,
and possesses eight to eleven thoracic segments (mode = 9) and
fourteen to thirty-three abdominal segments (mode = 18).
2. Asexual reproduction in S. tribranchiata occurs by
transverse fission and subsequent regeneration in a fashion
analogous to that in the related species S. incrustans.
Regeneration of the posterior bud involves transformation of
former abdominal segments into new thoracic segments.

3. The first external indication of budding (stage B) is
the constriction of a single whole abdominal segment, usually
abdominal chaetiger seven, but the range observed includes
abdominal chaetigers six to thirteen. Red pigment is usually
concentrated along this segment.
4. In budding stage C, the rudiments of the primordial
tentacles appear and the setae and uncini are shed from the
future prostomium and peristomium.
5. The emergence of collar setae, the shedding of abdominal
setae on the first uncinigerous thoracic segment, and the growth
of new thoracic notosetae characterize stage D.
6. Abdominal segments are converted to thoracic segments by
a regular process: (a) Loss of abdominal uncini, (b) growth of
thoracic notosetae, (c) formation of thoracic uncini, and (d)
loss of original abdominal setae. Within each segment the new
thoracic setae are added starting at the ventral and proceeding
toward the dorsal side. Along the body of the bud, changes occur
first in the anterior segments and last in the posterior segments,
forming a gradient.
7. As each new thoracic segment completes its develppment
externally, the thoracic mantle extends to the completed segment.
8. Abdominal regeneration in the parent accompanies the above
development: At least a pygidium and three new chaetigers are
added before separation of bud and parent. Separation is accom¬
panied by violent contractions localized at the junction of
parent and offspring. The guts of parent and offspring appear
to be functionally continuous until bud separation.
