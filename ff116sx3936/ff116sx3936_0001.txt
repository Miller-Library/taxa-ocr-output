Yee-2
SUMMARY
1. Suction recording electrodes were used to study
electrical activity in the radial nerve cord (RNC) of
the brittle star, Ophiopteris papillosa. In agreement
with results described by Tuft & Gilly (1984), the
fastest axons (class I) exhibited Cae independence.
Slower axons (class II) depend on Cae' for propagation.
2. Electrical activity can be recorded from the
hyponeural as well as the ectoneural surface of the RNC.
3. Simultaneous recordings from ectoneural and hyponeural
surfaces of a single segmented ganglion indicate that
the faster compound action potentials elicited by a brief
electrical shock are preferentially measured from the
hyponeural surface. This activity is probably caused by
class I axons. These axons are hypothesized to be
located most abundantly in the ectoneural tissue, near the
hyponeural border.
4. The axons responsible for the fast action potential
run along the RNC uninterrupted by chemical synapses for
at least 9 mm and possibly longer.
5. The electrical activity measured in response to
stimulation of the tip of Ophiopteris arm with the tube
foot from a predatory asteroid is very similar in
conduction velocity and lack of Cae' dependence to
that elicited by purely electrical stimulation.
