Ophiopteris papillosa two functionally distinct classes
of axons have been previously described (Tuft & Gilly, 1984).
Class I axons, believed to be the largest in the RNC, have
a low threshold and conduction velocity of over 1.00 m/s
at 1900. These axons depend on Na for propagation and do
not appear to require Ca2'. Class II axons were characterized
by a conduction velocity of 0.55 m/s and no Na' requirement.
A requirement for Ca2t for propagation was suggested by
these authors.
The radial nerve cord of Ophiopteris papillosa
consists of a chain of segmental ganglionic swellings
running from the oral disc to the tip of the arm.
Pentreath and Cottrell (1971) describe the nerve cord
of Ophiothrix fragilis, a similar ophiuroid. "It
is generally accepted that both the ganglia and their
connecting nerves consist of two superimposed systems,
a thick ventral ectoneural, and a thin dorsal hyponeural
system (Hyman, 1955). The former is presumed sensory
and motor, the latter purely motor. Branches from the
ecctoneural tissue serve the podia and spines, while
branches from the hyponeural tissue supply the interver-
tebral muscles." It is assumed that the neuroanatomy of
Ophiopteris papillosa is similar to that described for
Ophiotrix.
