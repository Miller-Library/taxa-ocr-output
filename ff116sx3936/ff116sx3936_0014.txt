the hyponeural electrode is not directly related to motor
function. Moreover, the fastest compound action potentials
recorded from the hyponeural side of the RNC display Cae
independence, characteristic of class I axons seen with an
ectoneural electrode. No hyponeural pathway is known
from anatomical studies to extend for distances greater
than one segmented region, but the published account of
this is somewhat vague (Pentreath & Cottrell, 1971).
While one could hypothesize Cae-independent giant
hyponeural axons which extend for distances of lcm or
more, or that some of the largest class I axons are actually
hyponeural fibers, such speculation does not seem necessary.
Rather, we propose that the fastest electrical activity
measured by an electrode on the hyponeural surface of the
RNC is actually due to the largest ectoneural class I axons,
which run along the dorsal surface of ectoneural tissue
and are in close proximity to the hyponeural region (See
Fig. 4).
Anatomical evidence consistant with this proposal
exists. Large axons (up to 8 u) in the RNC of Ophiothrix
are described by Brehm (1977) using electron microscopy
techniques. These axons are scattered deep within the
extoneural portion of the RNC and are not found in the
hyponeural nerve cord.
Furthermore, Pentreath & Cottrell (See their Fig. 7,
1971) indicate that the largest axons in the ectoneural
tissue of Ophiotrix do, in fact, lie just ventrally to
the hyponeural tissue as proposed here. These authors
