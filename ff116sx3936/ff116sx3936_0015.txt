reported that those axons were actually hyponeural in
origin, but their reasons for stating this are unclear and
convincing evidence is not presented.
If the fastest of the class I fibers are indeed
localized along the dorsal edge of the RNC near the
ectoneural/hyponeural boundary, the significance of such
close proximity must be questioned. Perhaps these axons
are in some way involved in communication between the
two tissues. As discussed above, this communication would
not seem to be a direct activation pathway to the motoneurons
innervating the intervertebral muscles.
Are Class I Axons Involved In Sensory Integration?
Finally in this study, we were concerned with discerning
the function of the class I axons. Since no apparent
motor output accompanied electrical stimulation, it was
hypothesized that the very fast spikes caused by class I
axons might serve more of a sensory function. This idea
is supported by comparison of electrical stimulation and
stimulation of the RNC by a tubefoot of Pycnopodia
helianthoides. Ophiopteris papillosa exhibits an
escape respons from Pynopodia characterized by a
stereotypic arm-jerk followed by movement of the body
away from the stimulus (Burkhart, 1984). Electrical
activity in the RNC caused by the tubefoot stimulus
greatly precedes the motor responses and propagates at
at a velocity characteristic of class I axons. It is
