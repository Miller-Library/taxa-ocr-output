(47420) pulled to a final diameter of 150 - 200 microns
using the heat of a soldering iron. The electrode measured
the difference in voltage sensed between two Ag: AgCl
wires, one inside the barrel of the syringe, and the
other wrapped around the polyethylene tip. The signal
recorded from the RNC was amplified through a Tektronix
Type 122 Low Level Pre-Amp with low/hi pass filters set
at 1 KHz/ 8Hz. Records were photographed off a
Tektronix 5111 storage oscilloscope.
Electrical activity of both ectoneural and hyponeural
portions of the RNC was measured. In all cases "windows"
of length 1-2 cm were made by removing ventral plates to
expose a segment of the RNC. Unless otherwise indicated,
the stimulating electrode and recording electrode were
positioned in the same "window" over a distance varying
from 4 - 20 mm. Conduction velocity in this report is
defined as the interelectrode distance divided by the
latency from the onset of the stimulus pulse to the
peak of the recorded spike in question.
For ectoneural recording the electrode was positioned
over a ganglionic swelling and slight suction applied,
until spontaneous activity of the RNC appeared. When
hyponeural activity alone was recorded, the RNC was
severed in a region close to the oral disc. Ectoneural
nerve roots leading laterally to the podia and spines
were then gently cut away over a length and the RNC was
