with those due to the electrical stimulation.
Stimulating the tip of Ophiopteris arm with a tube-
foot of the predatory asteroid Pycnopodia helianthoides
evokes a vigorous behavioral escape responseof the arm
(Burkhart, 1984). Electrical recordings made from the
moment of chemotactile (i.e. with a tubefoot) or electrical
stimulation clearly both show fast compound action potentials
of similar amplitude, wave form and conduction velocity,
An example of recordings made sequentially from the same
site of both means of stimulation are shown in Fig. 3.
While an exact correspondence in the two records
does not exist, class I - like activity is present in both,
For this reason, we hypothesize the involvement of class
I axons along the sensory pathway activated by the tubefoot
simulus. Furthermore, the activity elicited by the tubefoot
shows the same sort of Cae independence characteristic of
class I axons (Burkhart, 1984).

Results described in this paper confirm and extend
findings on Ophiopteris papillosa (Tuft & Gilly, 1984)
and adds new information of the function of the giant
axons in ophiuroids.
Are chemical synapses involved in class I axon transmission?
Brehm (1977 has suggested an average length of 4.2 cm
for axons in Ophiotrix which displayed a conduction
