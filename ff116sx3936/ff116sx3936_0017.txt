ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I wish to thank Chuck Baxter, Mark Denny, William Gilly
and Freya Sommer for making Bio 175H a possibility, for their
patience and enthusiasm for teaching. Thanks to Brad Jones,
Peter Barnett and Todd Scheuer for advice. Thanks to Freya
Sommer for collecting the animals and instilling in me a greater
appreciation for invertebrates. Cheers to my class for the entire
course and the all-nighters in the last week.
I am most grateful to Commander Wm. F. Gilly for his
ingenuity, humor, wisdom and willingness to teach a bit of
electrophysiology to a kid who in the beginning of the quarter
didn't even know what a banana plug was.
