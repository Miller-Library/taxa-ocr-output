order to compare the activity evoked by the two methods
of stimulation.
All experiments were conducted in NSW unless otherwise
indicated. Ca“-free artificial sea water (ASW) contained
470mM Nacl, 10mM KC1, 60mM MgC12, 10 mM TRIS, 10mM EGTA.
Final pH was adjusted to 7.8 and osmolality approximately
980 osmol/Kg H20.
In order to change the bathing medium during an
experiment without disrupting the electrode attachment,
solution in the chamber was first slowly drained. The
new solution was then carefully added to the dish,
covering the entire animal.
All experiments were conducted at 12.5-1600.
RESULTS
Electrical activity very similar to the multi-component
action potentials described by Brehm (1977) and Tuft &
Gilly (1984) was also recorded in this study. Figure
1A shows a record of presumably class I axon activity
with a conduction velocity of about 0.4 m/s at 1300.
Class II activity is also seen at a conduction velocity of
0.19 m/sec.
The characteristic conduction velocity of class I
axons as measured by Tuft & Gilly (1984) was 1.39 m/s
(+ .14 SD) at 19°0. The characteristic conduction
