velocity of the first detectable sign of electrical activity
in this study at 14-14.500 was 0.53 m/s (+.20 SD, N - 23)
for seven arms. This value is similar to the 0.38 m/s
average given by Brehm (1977) for another species of
ophiuroid at 15Â°0. It is assumed that this fast activity
is due to action potentials in the class I axons.
SENSITIVITIES OF CLASS I & CLASS II AXONS TO CA REMOVAL.
Removal of Cae from the bathing medium surrounding
the ophiuroid did not affect the activity of class I axons
but eliminated activity of class II axons. Figure 1B
shows the activity of class I axons after an animal
had been dissected in Ca2t-free ASW and the nerve bathed in
the medium for a total of 49 minutes. Activity with a
conduction velocity of.44 m/s is clearly present.
Following restoration of NSW, class I activity persists,
and class II axons activity returns (Fig. 1A).
In Ca2'-free ASW bathing media, the earliest detectable
electrical activity exhibits a characteristic conduction
velocity of 0.43 m/s (+.02 SD. N=8) for two different
arms. This value is close to that cited above for
natural sea water. This rapidly propagating activity is
therefore identified with class I axons.
COMPARISON OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY RECORDED FROM
ECTONEURAL VS. HYPONEURAL SURFACES.
Pentreath and Cottrell (1971) report an anatomical and
functional separation of the RNC of Ophiotrix fragilis into
hyponeural and ectoneural tissue. Measurements from
