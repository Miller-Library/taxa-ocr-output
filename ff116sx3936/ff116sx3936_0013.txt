swelling where a thin layer of collagen separates hyponeural
from ectoneural tissue. Considerable intermingling of the tissues
occurs in interganglionic regions (See Fig. 1, Fig. 2 Pentreath
& Cottrell, 1971).
Due to the relatively large tip diameter of the suction
recording electrode (150 - 250 u) in comparison to that of the
RNC itself (150u for hyponeural, 625 u for ectoneural in a
ganglionic region), the electrically visible volume of nerve
over which a seal has been placed hyponeurally probably contains
both hyponeural and ectoneural tissue. As such, the neural
activity measured by an electrode positioned on the hyponeural
surface is likely to contain activity of both hyponeural and
ectoneural axons.
A second argument for assigning an ectoneural location to
the fastest class 1 axons is based on a consideration of the
functional aspects of the two tissues. The hyponeural layer of
the RNC is reported by Pentreath & Cottrell (1971) to be of
purely motor function. In the ganglionic regions, hyponeural
motor neurons send out large diameter (up to 12 u) processes of :
about 300 u length to directly inervate the intervertebral muscles,
and are thus responsible for the arm flexing by the ophiuroid. These
large motor axons exit the ganglion dorsally through holes in the
ossicles.
Despite the large size of these axons, stimulation of the RNC
of Ophiopteris with electrical shocks that excited class I axons
did not elicit any obvious motor response of the intervertebral muscles.
This suggests that the fast electrical activity recorded by the
