6. The runctional role of class 1 axons is discussed.
These fibers are suggested to be involved in a sensory
pathway of some sort, rather than a motor output pathway,
INTRODUCTION
Knowledge of echinoderm nervous system function is
limited, largely due to small neural units and lack of
centralization. Furthermore, nervous system tissue is
virtuallyembedded in a complex connective tissue-ossicle
matrix. Ophiuroids provide a useful preparation for
studying general echinoderm nervous system due to the
presence of relatively large axons and quite accessible
nerves. Brehm (1977) has described axons in the radial
nerve cord (RNC) of Ophiotrix fragilis of a size much
larger than that seen in most echinoderms (78 um diameter
vs. K1 um). Cobb & Stubbs (1981) reported axons in Ophiura
texturata to be up to 20 um in diameter.
Electrical activity evoked by brief electrical
shocks in the ophiuroid RNC consists of rapidly propagating
compound action potentials due to activation of "giant"
axons (Brehm, 1977). This activity is especially apparent
because it has a low threshold and yields discrete
spike-like voltages.
Little has been done to study the electrophysiological
characteristics of the ophiuroid nervous system. In
