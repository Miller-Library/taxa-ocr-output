velocity of 0.38 m/s. This conclusion was based upon the
following of the largest spikes of a train along the RNC.
Tuft & Gilly (1984) felt that synapses were not involved
in class I axon transmission in Ophiopteris over a distance
of at least 1.5 cm based on the very rapid conduction velocity
and tentative lack of Cae' dependence for transmission.
In this study, we hypothesize a non-interrupted length
of at least 1 cm for class I axons based upon studies
of Cae independence. Class I fibers maintained their
electrical activity over a recording distance of 1 cm in
CaÂ°"-free ASW indicating that in this length, the axons
are not interrupted by chemical synapses. Characterization
of class II axons based upon 0 Cae' studies are not
as clear. Because the activity of class II axons is eliminated
by the removal of Ca2', it is possible that they are
interrupted more often by chemical synapses, perhaps in
every segmental ganglion as proposed by Cobb & Stubbs (1981).
Whether or not electrical synapses are involved in any way
in transmission for either axonal type remains unknown, but
there would seem to be no reason for requiring this.
