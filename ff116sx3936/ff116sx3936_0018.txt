SUMMARY OF FIGURES
1A. Class I axon and class II axon activity as recorded in NSW.
1B. Class I axon activity as recorded in Cae-free ASW.
Two records of electrical activity measured simultaneously
2.
from ectoneural and hyponeural surfaces.
Comparison of RNC activity elicited by purely electrical
3.
stimulus ys. chemotactile stimulus provided by a tube foot
of Pycnopodia helianthoides.
Hypothetical model showing anatomical location of class I
fibers within the RNC based upon electrophysiological data.
