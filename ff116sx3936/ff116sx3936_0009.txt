the hyponeural side of the RNC in response to electrical
stimulation resulted in reproducible electrical activity
similar to that recorded from the ectoneural surface.
The characteristic conduction velocity for all ectoneural
recordings made was 0.53 m/s (+.20 SD, N-23from 7 arms)
and for hyponeural 0.56 m/s (+.06 SD, N=12 from 3 arms).
When both ectoneural and hyponeural activity were
recorded simultaneously from the same ganglion, the first
sign of electrical activity inevitably appeared first in
the hyponeural recording (See Fig. 2). In no case did
simultaneously recorded ectoneural and hyponeural activity
show a striking correspondence in individual spikes.
Thus, each electrode must record from alimited volume of
nerve near its tip. The exact location of active units
is not certain however, and this will be discussed later.
COMPARISON OF ELECTRICAL STIMULUS VS. CHEMO/TACTILE STIMULUS.
Behavioral response corresponding to electrical activty
of the RNC of Ophiopteris papillosa have not been studied.
Attempts in the present experiments to correlate any form
of motor output with electrical shocks exciting RNC activity
were not successful. Tubefoot retraction occasionally could
be stimulated and mucous secretion seemed to increase with
stimulation, but activation of the vertebral muscles which
move the arm could not be produced.
In light of these negative results, we sought a more
physiological method of stimulating class I axons in the
RNC in order to compare the associated electrical response
