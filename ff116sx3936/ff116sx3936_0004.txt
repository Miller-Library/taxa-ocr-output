MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimins of Ophiopteris papillosa were collected
subtidally using SCUBA from the Monterey Bay near
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, Ca. Animals
were maintained in holding tanks in running natural
sea water (NSW) at 1500.
In order to expose the radial nerve cord, an animal
was turned upside-down and placed in a sylgard floored
dish. The oral disc and arms of the animal were restrained
using U-shaped pins. Two parallel cuts were made on the
ventral plates (ossicles), close to the base of the tube
feet. Then, the layer of material immediately beneath
the ossicle was cut using a scaple, and the ossicles
were individually plucked off of the arm. Unless otherwise
specified, all dissections were carried out in natural
sea water.
A bipolar stimulating electrode made of fine Pt
wires was painted with nail polish to expose only the
very tips of the wires. The electrode was placed on
top of the RNC, generally straddling a ganglionic
swelling. Tektronix Type 162 Waveform Generator and
Type 161 Pulse Generator were used to produce the
rectangular pulses (.5- 2 msec duration) used to
stimulate the RNC.
Recording electrodes were made from a 1 ml disposable
syringe fitted with a tip of Intramedic Polyethylene tubing
