then lifted sightly and folded over itself, thereby
exposing the hyponeural surface. The recording electrode
was then again positioned over a ganglionic swelling and
recordings made as previously described.
For simultaneous recordings from ectoneural and
hyponeural surfaces, the RNC was exposed as for hyponeural
recording, but a suction electrode was first attached to
the ectoneural surface of a selected ganglion, and the
nerve was lifted up a few mm by this attachment. Another
electrode was then applied to the exposed hyponeural
ganglion surface.
Experiments were also carried out stimulating Ophiopteris
RNC with a tube foot of Pyonopodia helianthoides, a
predatory asteroid. A freshly procured tube foot was placed
on the end of a hypodermic needle attached to the movable
breaker of a d.c. relay. A toggle switch simultaneously
activated the relay which moved the tube foot several
millimeters to hit the ophiuroid arm and triggered a
sweep on the storage oscilloscope allowing the accompanying
electrical activity of the RNC to be recorded. For these
experiments, two "windows" were prepared to expose the RNC.
The recording electrode was placed in the window closer
to the oral disc; the stimulating electrode was placed in
a window near the tip of the arm. Electrical stimuli were
delivered until activity of class I axons was reliably
recorded. Then, tubefoot stimulation was carried out in
