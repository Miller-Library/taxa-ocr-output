Are the most rapidly conducting class I axons ectoneural?
In this study, electrical activity measured from the
hyponeural surface of the RNC was recorded. In fact,
the most rapidly propagating axons were preferentially
seen when recording from the hyponeural surface. There
is some question, therefore as to the anatomical location
of the large axons underlying these rapid action potentials.
Although a suction electrode as used in the present
experiments must sample activity in a prescribed volume
of RNC near its tip, the extent of that volume relative
to the diameter of the RNC is not certain. Thus, while
an electrode may be positioned on the hyponeural surface,
recordings made there need not reflect only hyponeural
activity. It is believed that the fastest phase of the
compound action potential seen by the hyponeural electrode
is actually due to class 1 axons as described by Tuft &
Gilly (1984) which may be located in the ectoneural
portion of the RNC as they proposed.
One argument behind this idea involves the geometry
of the RNC and the position of the suction recording
electrode. We assume in this study that the neuro-
anatomy of Ophiopteris is similar in nature to that
of Ophiothrix described by Pentreath & Cottrell (1971).
Thus, the hyponeural tissue is a thin layer lying dorsally
to the ectoneural tissue. The most pronounced separation
between the two tissues occurs in the ganglionic
