F.A.A. in Metridium Senil

Chromatography revealed several ninhydrin positive spots
which corresponded with R values of standard solutions of: leu¬
cine, taurine, aspartic acid, valine, gluatamic acid, proline,
threonine, glycine, serine, and lysine. The following pairs of
am no acids could not be resolved chromatographicly: isoleucine
and leucine; proline and hydroxiproline; and glycine and serine.
The F.A.A. in different Tissue Fractions
The different tissue fractions were seperated during the course
of thawing frozen animals. The ectoderm was taken to be the first
layer on the column of the anemone to thaw. It is easily removed
with scalpel and tweezers. The mesoglea content of this sample is
Paction
not known. The tenntacles and oral discwas taken as the upper por¬
tion of a horizontal section through the column at the base of the
tenntacles and includes oral disc and mouth. Some mesentaries and
ectoderm were unavoidably included in this fraction. Muscular tis¬
was seperated from the mesentaries by scrapping the retractor mus¬
cles free fromm mesentary tissue. Gastrodermal tissue taken to be
exclusivly mesentaries. Tissue samples were dried in 100°C oven and
ground by mortar and pestal. Extraction same as above.
Table 2 presents results and shows significant differences
between F.A.A. levels of different tissues. Student t test shows
significant difference between all tissue fractions except between
ectoderm and muscular tissue which are similar. Gastrodermal tissue
shows the highest concentation of F.A.A. with tenntacles and oral
disc next highest. Ectoderm and muscular tissue had the lowest values,
