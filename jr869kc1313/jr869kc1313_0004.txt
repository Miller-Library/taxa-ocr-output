Methods and Materials
All animals were collected from the floating docks in Mon¬
ter arbor. Montere California.
Results
F.A.A. levels in Natural Populations
Eight animals were blotted dry and weighed. The animals were
immediatl frozen. A one gram sample of each animal was homogenized
in a glass tube and teflon homogenizer with four milliliters of sev¬
enty per cent cold ethanol. The homogenate was allowed to stand for
twenty four hours at 5° (before centrifugation at 10,000 rpms to
remove ethanol insoluable materials. The supernatant was removed and
the pellet washed by resuspension in two milliliters of 70% ethanol
followed by centrifugation. The supernatants and their washings were
filtered through Whatman #1 paper. Six samples of each extract were
andlysed using the ninhydrin technique of Moore and Stein (1952).
Qualitative analysis of individual amino acids was accomplished by
two demensional ascending paper chromatography employing Butanol¬
glacial acetic acid-HoO, 100:40:60, followed by phenol saturated
with H9O with detection with 2% ninhydrin spray.
Most animals showed similar levels of F.A.A. pool concen¬
trations. There are no significant differences between any values
of F.A.A. in the animals of the sample with the exception of animal
A which is significantly different from all other animals. Student
t test performed,P .05. The mean value for the sample was 94.4 M.
Replicates from the same anemones showed no significant difference
in values and indicates a high degree of reproducablity of extraction
and measurment methods.
