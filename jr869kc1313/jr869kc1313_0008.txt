F.A.A. in Metridium Senile
page 7
Kim Suelzle
The differences in the levels of F.A.A. in specific tissues
are in accordance with several previously published reports. Schlicter
(1974) found a much higher concentration,by anorder of magnitude,
in gastrodermal tissue as compared to ectodermal tissue in the sea
anemone ,Anemonia Sulcata.Ferguson (1967) found similar differences
in tissue concentrations in the starfish, Henricia Sanquiolenta.
A possible explaination tissue differences may be related to
the digestive and absorbtive function of the gastrodermal tissue.
Ectodermal tissue must rely heavily on diffusion of F.A.A. from the
gastrodermis. Indications are thar this rate of diffusion is quite
low. The result is that there are fewer F.A.A. available to the ecto¬
dermal cell to incorporate into their F.A.A. pools.
Another possible explaination for the low levels of F.A.A.
in E to dermal tissues relates to osmotic regulation. The ecto¬
dermal tissue may be more suseptable to osmotic stress than Gastro¬
dermal tissue. Experiments have shown that movement of F.A.A. out
of the cells in response to osmotic stress may result in considerable
Ke
loss of F.A.A. to the environment.loweconcentrations in the most
stressed tissues could prevent any large scale loss of F.A.A. to the
environment.
in the anemone nemen sata
Schlicter (1974) showed thatthe majority of uptake of dissol¬
ved amino acids from the surrounding medium takes place in the cells
of the ectoderm. Lower concentrations of intracellular F.A.A. in
these tissues lowers the concentration gradient for transport of ex¬
tracellular F.A.A. into the cells.
