Chromatoraphy revealed a very large concentration of taurine in
F.A.A. pool of Metridium Senile.
Summary
1) Metridium Senile taken from natural environmental conditions
show no significant differences in the F.A.A. pool concentration
between different animals
2) Gastrodermal tissue of Metridium Senile has a significantly highÂ¬
er F.A.A. pool concentration than does tissue from the tenntac
which contains significantly concentrations than either muscular
tissue or ectodermal tissue which have similar concentrations.
Fed Metridium Senile show higher concentrations of intracellular
F.A.A. than starved M.S.
4) F.A.A. pool concentration varies in proportion the salinity
of the surrounding medium.
