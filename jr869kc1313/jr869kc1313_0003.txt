Introduction
High concentrations of unbound intracellular free amino
acids have been described in a wide variety of marine invert¬
ebrates. Concentrations are found to be much higher than either
vertabrates of terrestrial invertebrates, Awapara (1962). These
free amino acid, F.A.A., pools appear to have several functions.
Stephens (1968), Potts (1958), Shaw (1958). and Lange (1963,1964)
have shown the concentration and individual constituents of F.A.A.
pools in a variety of marine invertebrates change as a result of
osmotic stress which suggests a possible osmoregulatory role for
intracellular F.A.A. Shick (1975) has shown that the levels of in¬
tracellular F.A.A. in polyps of Aurelia Aurita Scyphistomae increase
with feeding which suggests the F.A.A. pool may serve as a tempor¬
ary intracellular storage form of Amino acids for use in synthesis
as well as catabolism. Within an individual organism different tis¬
sues have been foundtto have radicly different concentrations of
F.A.A. Schlicter (1974) showed significantly higher levels of F.A.A.
in the cells of the gasrodermal tissue than in the cells in the ecto¬
dermal tissue of the sea anemone, Anemonia Sulcata, which suggests
the pools may serve different functions in different parts of the
animal.
The study reported here was designed to assess the function
of the free amino acid pool of The sea anemone,Metridium Senile.
Four aspects have recieved particular attention. One deals with the
variation in F.A.A. pools between different animals in the natural
environment. Another deals with differences between F.A.A. pools of
four different tissuesof a same animal. Also studied were the ef
fects of feeding and osmotic stress on F.A.A. levels.
