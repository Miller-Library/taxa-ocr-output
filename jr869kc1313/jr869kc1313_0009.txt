F.A.A. in Metridium Senile

The magnitude of the differences between F.A.A. concentrations
between starved and fed animals is somewhat lower than found in sim¬
ilar studies with other marine invert brates. Shick (1975) found
differencs between F.A.A. concentrations in starved and fed animals
was approximately fivefold. A possible explaination for the low
values observed in this study maybe related to the time period be
tween the last feeding and the time of extraction. Shicks values re¬
present values for animals extacted within twentyfour hours of the
last feeding. Studies have shown that there is an initial increase
in F.A.A. concentration within twentyfour hours of feeding, with with
the concentration dropping to a lower level after this time.By ex¬
tracting seventy two hours after final feeding it appears what is
being measured is the increase in this lower baseline level.
The salinity data indicates the response of the F.A.A. pool
to osmotic stress. STephens (1969) observed a similar response in
the brittle star, Ophiactis sp.Changes in the concentrations of
individual amino acids can not be detected by the methods employed
in this study. Actual concentrations of individual amino acids are
known to vary as a result of environmental conditions while the tot¬
al ninhydrin positive composition of the pool remains constant. Tau¬
rine and glycine have been shown to be moved out of the cell prefer¬
entially to other constituents of the pool in response to osmotic
stress. This situation could prove beneficial to the organism in
that more important structural and metabolic amino acids could
be retained in the tissue while the more expendable amino acids
i.e. taurine and glycine could fullfl the osmoregulatory functions,
