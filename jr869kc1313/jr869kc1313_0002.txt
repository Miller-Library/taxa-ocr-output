Abstract
1) Metridium Senile taken from natural environments show no sig¬
nificant differences beteen animals in free amino acid pool
concentrations.
2) Gastrodermal tissue of Metridium Senile has a significantly high¬
er free amino acid pool concentration than does Tenntacular tis¬
sue which has a higher concentration than either muscular or
ectodermal tissue which have similar concentrations.
3) Fed Metridium Senile show higher intracellular free amino acid
concentrations than do starved Metridium senile.
4) Free amino acid pool concentrations in Metridiun Senile vary
in direct proportion to the salinity of the surrounding medium.
