70% instant ocean. One animal one half was placed in 125% instant
ocean and one half in 70% instant ocean. All samples were kept at
14°C. After ten hours all animals were removed from water and dried
in 100°C oven to remove the influence of differences in intracellular
water concentrations. Extraction and analysis as before.
Results show that F.A.A. concentration varies in proportion
to the salinity. Increased salinity resulted in higher F.A.A. con¬
centrations. Lower salinities resulted in lower F.A.A. concentration.
Samples placed in 125% salinity had an average value of 25% higher
than samples in 100% salinity. Samples placed in 70% salinity had
an average of 20% lower concentration of F.A.A. than samples in 100%
salinity. Student t tests were performed on all pairs of values.
Allshowed significant difference, p2.05, except for two animals.

Discussion
Values for F.A.A. concentrations in animals taken from the
natural environment show surprizing consistancy. Shick (1975) noted
a variability of an order of magnitude in natural populations of
Aurelia Aurita polyps. I suspect that the lack of variability found
in this study is due more to my sampling technique than any inher¬
ent characteristic of the specie. Animals were taken from sample
sitesvery close in proximity thus providing a vec homogeneous en¬
vironment amoung sample animals. Samples taken from entirely differ¬
ent environments could be expected to have substantialy different
concentrations. To make any conclusions as to intra specie level
a much larger sample would have to be taken.
