Table 3 gives the relationship of these concentrations relative to
the values for the gastrodermal fraction.
Chromatography did not reveal gross differences in the comp¬
osition of the F.A.A. pools in the different tissue fractions.
Effects of eeding and Starvation on the F.A.A. Pool
Ten animals were maintained for two weeks in running seawater
from which 90% of the particles 44and larger had been removed by
filtration. At the end of this period five of the animals were fed
2 ml of squid homogenate every three days. After three weeks of feed¬
ing F.A.A. levels were assessed in these five starved animals and
five fed animals. Extraction was carried out seventy two hours after
the last feeding.
The results are shown in table 4 and indicate F.A.A. levels
in tissues of fed animals were slightly higher than star animals.
However student t test performed on the data failed to show a sig¬
nificant difference, p.05(.10
The Effect of Salinity on F.A.A. Pools
Ten animals were cut in half and allowed to recuperate for
three days. All halves were reattached and opened during this period.
All animal halves were placed in 100%"instant ocean" for twenty four
hours to provide a common osmotic baseline.One half of an animal
was used as a control for the other half in subsequent experiments.
For four animals one half of the animal was placed in 100% instant
ocean and the other half placed in 125% instant ocean. For one ani¬
mal both halves were placed in 100% instant ocean. For four other
animals one half was placed in 100% instant ocean and one half in
