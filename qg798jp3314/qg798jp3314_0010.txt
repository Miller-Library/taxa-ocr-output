do not make it to the membrane may be "reabsorbed" by the cell, perhaps in endosomes,
where the K' channel protein is broken down. This could result in a lower detectable level
of protein in immuno-labeling.
The above hypothesis may also account for the presence of abnormal current seen
in most of the control cells recorded from. It is possible that whether the microtubules are
intact or not, Ã  population of KZA containing vesicles simply diffuse to the surface
membrane, where KZ4 protein might be inserted into the membrane in a manner different
than those channels that are delivered by microtubules as described above. Therefore many
untreated cells expressing KZ4, have a low, underlying level of abnormal current
expression normally masked by the current produced by properly inserted channel protein.
In demecolcine treated cells, very few channels, if any, are transported to the membrane
and inserted properly, resulting in the expression of small, abnormal currents.
Even though the above hypothesis is questionable, and can only be validated with
further research, a clear result still emerges. Cells treated with demecolcine express a
lower number of functional KZ4 channels. A link between ion channel expression and
microtubule stability has been suggested by the experiments presented in this paper.
supporting the hypothesis that microtubules have a function in determining neuronal
excitability. The dynamic nature of microtubules, their ability to quickly form complex
networks, and change distribution might have implications on the way in which
information is processed by each individual neuron, and in turn, in the entire central
nervous system.
