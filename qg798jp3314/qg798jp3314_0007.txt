A portion of the sames cells used for the precipitation above were removed from the normal
medium and placed in methionine free Graceâ€™s medium (Life Technologies, Inc. Grand
Island, NY) for 1 hour at room temperature. 150uCi of PSmethionine was added and
the cells incubated for 3 hours and chased in the normal medium.
Results
Electrophysiology
It was found by clamping 12 control cells that 58.3% of the cells showed outward K
current similar to that seen in naturally occuring KVI-type channels (table 1, figure la). Of
the 16 demecolcine treated cells, only 38.25% showed current (table 1). Three of the
demecolcine treated cells showing current displayed kinetics similar to those in untreated
cells. The rest of the cells showed abnormal channel kinetics defined by lack of delay in
activation and the absence of outward current during 250 ms pulse (figure lb.). In the 7
control cells that showed outward current, the average density (G./C) of the channels was
1.01120.533 nS/pF, whereas the average density in demecolcine treated cells was
0.39320.2 nS/pF. When subjected to Student's t-test, the difference between these values
was significant at the 95% confidence interval.
It is important to note that in control cells showing low channel density, abnormal
current traces similar to those seen in demecolcine treated cells were also observed. Only
three treated cells, however, had normal current, and none showed G/C values above
626 nS/pF.
Immuno-flourescence
Results obtained from immuno-flourescent microscopy of the treated cells showed an
obvious differences in labeling intensity relative to control controls. Further it was seen
