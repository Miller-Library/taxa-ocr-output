was filtered at 10 kflz using an 8-pole bessel filter and sampled at a rate of 2-20 kklz. The
external solution contained 20 mM KCI, 130 mM Nacl, 10 mM Cacl, 10 mM MgCl., 5
mM HEPES, 5 mM MgSO,, and 5 mM Glucose at a ph of 7.2 and osmolarity equal to the
internal solution.
Data Analysis
Recordings were first qualitatively judged to possess Kt current by observing the presence
of normal" channel kinetics, increased rate of activation and inactivation with increased
voltage steps . For our purpose, cells that did not display these properties were assigned a
K conductance value of zero. In cells that showed the presence of normal current, tail
currents were measured to assess the level of K: conductance (Gy). Voltage was first
stepped 420mV for 5 ms to fully activate the K: channels and then stepped to a series of
levels (140,-120,-100, and-80 mV) for 73 ms. The amplitude of this inward tail current
immediately following the pulse was measured and plotted as a function of the
repolarization voltage in order to estimate the K: conductance of the cell (G. - %y in a lV
plot). Gx was normalized to cell surface area dividing by the capacitance of the cell (C).
which was measured by integrating the area under the current trace for a-10 mV step for s
ms. Values for G C (conductance density) thus serve as an indicator of functional Kt
channel expression at the plasma membrane..
Immuno-flourescence
Cells were cultured on 12 mmn diameter circular glass coverslips in a 24 well culture dish.
At the end of the 8 day course of the experiment, the cells were fixed 100% methanol at O
C for 6 minutes. They were then treated for 30 minutes in 0. 1% TritonX-100 in PBS
(C.O8M Na, HPO, 0025M Nakl, PO, and O. IM NaCl, pH 7.5), and blocked for 1 hour
in PBS containing 5% dry milk at 4Â°C. The primary antibody was anti-KZ4, a rabbit
polyclonal antiserum directed against a KZ4 fusion protein (yet unpublished) and used at
1.100 dilution in O.1% milk-PBS solution. The cells were incubated in the primary
