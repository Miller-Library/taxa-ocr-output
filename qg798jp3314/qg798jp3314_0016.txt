Current Traces Seen in Demecolcine Treated Cells. a. Shows the current traces
resulting from 250 ms voltage steps (—40,0, 10,20, and 40 mV) in a KZA expressing Sf9
cell kept in culture for 8 days at 18°C. b. Shows Sf9 cells also expressing KZ4, but
incubated for the last three of the eight days in 50 uM demecolcine.
Table 1. Conductance, Resting Potential, Capacitance, and Channel density
for all cells recorded. Gy and V, were estimated as the slope and X-intercept
respectively of the I/V curve described in Materials and Methods. Cells under the heading
1e  7aemeoleme were incubated for one day aster infection at 28.C and treated with 50 ub
demecolcine for 7 days. Similarily, the cells headed 128 44183demeedene were incubated
after infection at 28°C, but were kept in normal medium at 18?C for 4 days, and then
treated with demecolcine at 18°C for only 3 days.

identified with anti KZ4 polyclonal antibody, followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-
rabbit secondary antibod
