antibody overnight at 4°C. Cells were then washed 3X in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at
4°C in 1:500 goat anti rabbit antibody conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.,
Eugene, OR). Coverslips were finally mounted with SlowFade Component B (Molecular
Probes). The slides were viualized and photographed on a Zeiss Axioskop flourescent
microscope using a 40X and 100X oil immersion objective.
Immuno-Precipitation
Antibody labeling
A solution containing Sf9 cells infected with KZ4 was centrifuged for 1 minute at 13,000
rpm, and the pellet was mechanically lysed by grinding it into solution. Denser portions of
the lysate, including cell membranes, were isolated by spinning the solution again for 30s
at 13,000 rpm and removing the supernatant. Resuspension of the pellet was performed in
200 ul HBS solution (25mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) of 1% CHAPS. CHAPS
was used because it is a detergent that effectively solubilizes lipids in the lysate while
maintaining strong protein interactions present in the cell. Primary anti KZA antibody was
added in solution at 1/250 and solution was incubated in a LABQUAKE rotator at 4° C
overnight. IX 10° beads of sheep anti-rabbit-coated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Corp.
Great Neck, NY) were added and incubated for 1 hour in lysate solution. The magnetic
beads were isolated by holding the tube next to a magnet and aspirating the supernatant.
Beads were then washed 3X with 1 ml of 1% CHAPS in HBS. Precipitated protein was
eluted by suspending the washed Dynabeads in sample buffer and incubating for 10 min at
80° C. The eluted protein was seperated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon
blotting paper, and immunoblotted for tubulin with monoclonal anti o-tubulin N. 356
developed in mouse (Amersham Corp.).
