Materials and Methods
Sf9 Cell Culture
Sf9 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained at 28° as described elsewhere
(Summers, et al 1987.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ug/ml penicillin/
streptomyocin, and 5 ug/ml Fungizone (Detomaso, et al. 1993) Sf9 cells were maintained
at 28° C at a density of 1-4 X 10° cells / ml in volumes ranging from 50-250 ml.
Uninfected cells were split every 3 days. For infections, log phase high viability cells
(98%, as determined by trypan blue exclusion) were centrifuged for 10 minutes and
resuspended at a density of 1X10 cell/mi in medium at room temperature. Viral stock was
added at a multipliticity of infection of 5-10. After 1 hour incubation, cells were dilluted to
1.5-2 X10° cells/ml with medium.
It was found that optimal expression of potassium current in the KZA infected cells was
produced by incubating the cells at 28°C for 1 day after infection and moving the cells to
18°C. Maximum current was found between days 5 and 8 at 18°C (unpublished
observations).
Electrophysiology
Whole cell voltage clamp was performed using fire-polished glass pipettes (1-3 MQ) filled
with an internal solution containing 50 mM KCl, ImM MgCl,, 5 mM HEPES, 50 mM K¬
glutamate, 5 mM EGTA, 20 mM K- aspartate, 60 mM KF, at a pH of 7.5 and osmolarity
of 320 mOsm. Experiments were performed at a temperature of 20° C. A List EPC-7
voltage clamp (Medical Systems, Garden City, NY) operating at low gain with series
resistance compensation was used. Linear ionic and residual capacity currents were
subtracted using a p/4 method deliverered at the holding potential of -100 mV. The data
