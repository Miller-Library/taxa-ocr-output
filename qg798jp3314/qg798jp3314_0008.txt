that the labeling of cells cultured for 3 days in demecolcine (12844183demecdne) was
brighter than that of cells treated with demecolcine for 7 days (1287demecoldne)
In addition to the differences in total level of immunoreactivity, more subtle
differences in protein distribution were observed between the experimental and control
cells. Tight, bright rings were seen outlining the control cell, (figure 2a.), whereas cells
incubated in demecolcine showed less dense staining around the periphery. In the treated
cells, the stain is far more diffuse throughout the cell (figure 2b)
Immuno-precipitation
Results from the immuno-precipitation experiment show that a-tubulin is precipitated with
the KZA channel protein. The protein composing the visible band (figure 3a) has been
labeled with anti o-tubulin monoclonal anti-mouse primary antibody. A protein within the
correct size range for tubulin, 53-57 kDa (figure 3b) is observed. Two controls were
performed in order to assure that first, KZ4 was precipitated, and second that tubulin was
not precipitated independent of KZ4. The first control, a radioactively labeled immuno
precipitation prepared from the same cells used for the antibody probed precipitation,
shows that KZ4 is indeed precipitated by the anti KZA antibody (figure 3c). The second
control, Ã  non-infected Sf9 culture, immunoprecipitated, and blotted alongside the
experimental cultures, showed no indication that tubulin was immuno-precipitated. This
suggests that only KZ4, and proteins connected to KZA were precipitated with the primary
antibody (figure 3a).
