percent, as in figure 8, and averaged at 18.319.2 percent.
Although there were measurements of very large facilitation, the
majority of recordings were smaller, thus the small average.
During long trains of stimuli, amplitudes tended to decrease
again toward the end of the train. Also, the second of the two
consecutive trains always began with a post-synaptic potential of
lower amplitude than the last response of the preceding train,
except in cases toward the end of the life of the tissue when the
train would begin with a particularly large spike and then
continue normally from there (Figure 9). Average decrease in the
amplitude of the spikes as measured from the last peak of the
first train to the first peak of the second train was 0.025t0.012
V/s.
Latency was recorded from the stimulus point to the beginning
of the resulting spike and averaged 8.410.6 ms. The latency of
the first spike was consistently at least 0.6 ms faster than the
remaining train, which had uniform latencies.
Two drops of 0.2mM curare, a neurotransmitter block, in a
50/50 mix of distilled water and sea water were applied to the
column. Recordings were taken at intervals of 30 seconds
beginning immediately after applying the drug for 14 minutes. The
signal emitted by the electroplaque column dropped sharply within
minutes after the curare was dripped into the ringer solution
(Figure 10a,b,c).
Conduction velocity of the nerve was also recorded by placing
the two electrodes 1.5 mm apart on a living nerve and then
activating the nerve with the stimulus and recording the latency
