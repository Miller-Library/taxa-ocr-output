Figure 1. This is a comparison the capacities of three different
size rays. Experiment 1 is the average peak voltage generated by
the ray, Experiment 2 is the average number of spikes per train
generated by the ray, Experiment 3 is the average time interval
between spikes in the ray.
Figure 2. This graph is designed to demonstrate the downward
trend of the top voltage of each string as compared to the
increase number of spikes in the associated string. Solid
box is th 19 cm ray, emptly box is the 17 cm ray, crossed box
is the 16 cm ray.
Figure 3. This graph demonstrates clearly the effect of
curare on the voltage amplitude of the electroplaque column
over time. The interval without data points reflects a
mechanical failure in the recording instrumentation.

ray.
Figure 5. A fluctuating whole animal shock train generated by the
16 cm ray.
