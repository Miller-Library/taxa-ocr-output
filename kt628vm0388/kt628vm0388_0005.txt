Conditioning
In this experiment, the goal was to condition the ray to an
electric stimulus (performed in collaboration with Lara
Rosenthal). A Grass S44 stimulator was used to generate a 10 Volt
impulse at 100 Hertz for 1 second. An electric probe was
constructed from a long wooden pole and two silver/silver chloride
electrodes were taped to the end. Immediately upon cessation of
the electric stimulus (conditioned stimulus or CS), the ray was
thumped on the wing with the probe (unconditioned stimulus or
UCS). These episodes were repeated every two minutes for a period
of thirty minutes and then CS was presented alone. The intent was
to ascertain if the ray would learn to associate the conditioned
stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus. On later trials, the
S was applied to the ground next to the ray, to provide a
control.
Alarm Shock Measurement:
This experiment was performed as an attempt to measure the
voltage and current generated by the Torpedo during alarm shocks.
A 31 x 38 om table of aluminum screening was constructed and
soldered to a length of Teflon coated 26 gauge wire which was
soldered to a 47 ohm resistor. Another electrode was constructed
with a 13 x 20 om piece of copper tape coated circuit board, with
an insulating wooden handle. This was soldered to an identical
length of wire without the resistor and both were run to a Nicolet
3091 digital oscilloscope.
Signals were recorded differentially
across the resistor on channel B of the oscilloscope. The
