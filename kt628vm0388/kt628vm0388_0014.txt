he curare experiment was performed for interest sake,
substantiating the biology/viability of the tissue. It identifies
that the mechanisms operating during the electric shock are
synaptic in origin and involving the neurotransmitter,
acetylcholine. The sharp fall in voltage amplitude with no data
points in the curare test is the result of mechanical failure and
was cured by jiggling a cord. However, the points on either side
of the fall are accurate and therefore, I accept the validity of
the test.
Summary
It is to be concluded, therefore, that 1) within the scope of
this experiment, rays cannot be conditioned to react to an
electric stimulus, 2) all shocks emitted by viable Torpedos are
made up of strings of spikes, 3) voltages can be recorded from a
Torpedo suspended in the air, 4) isolated columns of living
electric organ tissue can be stimulated to generate voltage
strings at a frequency of at least 80 Hertz, 5) facilitation and
depletion of neurotransmitter do occur in this tissue and have a
cancelling effect on each other.
