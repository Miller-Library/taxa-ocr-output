subsequent peaks increase in height. It seems, however, that with
long trains of stimuli, facilitation is countered by synaptic
fatigue, possibly resulting from depletion of neurotransmitter.
Therefore, the size of the peaks does not increase steadily to the
end of the train, but instead it grows to a maximum and then
decreases slightly until the end of the train. The first peak of
the next train always has a lower amplitude than the last peak of
the first train, in reliable tests. This indicates that the
facilitation does not carry over short breaks in stimuli bursts.
We also see less facilitation in the second train, indicating that
the synaptic fatigue carries over the short interval between
stimulus trains.
Firing a train of spikes may have advantages over giving off
one single blast with the mechanism used in the ray. Since it
seems that facilitation is an integral part of the shock
mechanism, it would stand to reason that one isolated spike could
not develop enough voltage to stun a fish or warn an intruder.
Facilitation may be necessary to build up enough voltage in the
electric organ itself so that the external spike string is as
potent as it is. On the other hand, perhaps facilitation is
necessary to compensate for synaptic fatigue.
It is interesting to note that the latency from the stimulus
to the peak is very regular. This is in contrast to the shock
pattern elicited from the whole animal. The time intervals
between peaks in the animal are variable, and therefore probably
reflect voluntary control by the ray.
