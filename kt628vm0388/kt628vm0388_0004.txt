observed facilitation, the augmenting of shock voltage due to
increased transmitter release, possibly in response to build up of
excess calcium in the terminal site. Since the organs of the two
species are similar, it is conceivable that facilitation also
occurs in the Pacific electric ray. This study focuses on the
warning shock, its accurate measurement, and the characteristics
that make up this uniquely evolved organ in the torpedo ray.
Materials and Methods
A total of fourteen rays were used in these experiments.
The first six rays were placed in a 109 x 225 x 44 am tank with
fresh, unfiltered flowing sea water run through a de-embolizing
column. This tank was enclosed in a tarpaulin shed designed to
emulate the lighting at thirty feet below the surface, the natural
habitat of the Torpedo. The bottom of the tank was covered with a

round holding tank with no sand and no covering.
Each ray was marked with small multicolored beads sewn to the
tail, in order to identify individuals. The rays were left alone
for one week and then small Boccaccio rock fish were introduced to
the tank for feeding purposes. The intention was to wait for the
ays to begin feeding and by that action, exhibit habituation to
the tank.
Upon expiring each ray was dissected in order to familiarize
the experimenters with the anatomy of the rays.
