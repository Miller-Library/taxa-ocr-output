subjects and it is not appropriate to derive a formula relating
the two parameters.
If one thinks of each electrocyte in a column as a battery
then it is apparent that the cells are in series in an electric
circuit. The sea water completes the circuit. Since potential
adds in a series arrangement of batteries, it follows that the
more batteries in a series, the more voltage would be generated.
Following this logic, voltage will depend on the number of
electrocytes in the column, and presumably, the thickness of the
electric organ. The thickness of the animal certainly increases
with length from wing to wing, so it is possible to speculate that
the voltage in a very large ray, say one meter in diameter, would
be very large indeed.
Sea water has a low resistance, about 25 ohm/cm, so that a
thin film of water surrounding the ray would probably short
circuit the current so that most of the electricity would not
travel through the resistor. Therefore, the voltage was measured
across a known distance in sea water and the amperage was
calculated fran these values using the standard equation: VIR
(voltage-currentxresistance). This is not altogether accurate
since the area over the electric organ from which the current was
recorded is not known. Therefore, only a small amount of current
generated by the electric organ was recorded. After experiencing
the shock first hand, I guess that the amperage is something on
the scale of household electrical systems, 5-15 Amperes, at least
two orders of magnitude greater than that measured.
