As the data indicate, it is possible for an individual ray to
generate shocks of varying voltages, within a train and between
trains. Although this seems intuitive for a living organism, as
opposed to a signal of mechanical origin, it might be expected
from the isolated column experiment that the shock would follow
the pattern of increasing voltage along the spike train. However,
as the data show, this is not the case.
While it is possible that the method of recording the voltage
may have caused same errors, it is unlikely that the voltage is
inaccurate since each section of the electric organ should be
giving out equal voltages, providing that the width of the
electric organs is uniform. Therefore, the measurements were
always accurate for at least some part of the electric organ. It
is possible that the variances within the trains is indicative of
the activation of different parts of the electric organ in
sequence, or it is possible that the ray is able to turn off some
of the cells in a stack in order to produce a smaller voltage.
Perhaps this turning off of cells is involuntary, due to synaptic
fatique or some unknown factor.
Likewise with the varied trains, it is unclear whether the
ray voluntarily controls the train length, or whether the cells
shut down at some threshold of fatigue.
Single Column Recording
It is clear that synaptic facilitation occurs in the isolated
columns of the electric organ. As seen in the results, the first
peak of a spike train is smaller than the second, and the
