oscilloscope was set to save the screen when triggered by the
rising phase of the shock.
The experiment was run at least five times on each of three
rays in the tarpaulin covered tank by placing the ray on the
aluminum screen and applying the copper paddle to one electric
organ. Pictures were taken of the saved screen with a Tektronix
C-5B Oscilloscope camera. Measurements were taken from the rays
suspended over the water on the screen so that the current would
not be lost to the relatively highly conductive sea water.
In order to record the current generated by the ray in one
electric organ, the stimulus pole was rerigged so that one
electrode was coiled at the tip of the pole while the second
electrode was taped 1.35 cm above the tip. The signal was
recorded differentially on the Nicolet oscilloscope.
Single Column Recording:
In this experiment, the electric organs were dissected out of
the ray and single columns of electrocytes were isolated with
their activating nerves. A suction electrode was applied to one
end of the column and run to the Nicolet 3091 digital
oscilloscope. Another suction electrode was applied to a large
nerve innervating the electrocyte column and run to the Grass S44
stimulator. Stimuli was applied to the nerve at 12 Volts for 0.5
ms and the summed neuromuscular junctional potentials were
recorded on the oscilloscope.
Upon establishing a response, a train of stimuli (0.5 ms, 12
Volts) was applied to the nerve at 80 Hertz for a brief interval,
