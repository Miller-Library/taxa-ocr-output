Abstract
This paper is devoted to characterizing the electric organs
in the Pacific electric ray, Torpedo californica. These rays do
not show signs of conditioning to electric stimuli. It is
possible to record the amplitude of the voltage generated by the
ays' electric organs and to record post-synaptic potentials from
isolated living electric organ tissue. The neuromuscular junction
potentials are capable of following nerve stimulation at
frequencies in exc
ess of 80 Hertz. These isolated column
recordings show that facilitation occurs in the neurotransmitting
mechanism that produces the shock.
