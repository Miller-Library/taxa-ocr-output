regular latencies. Length of shock strings varied from ray to ray
and seemed to correlate with the size of the ray (Figure 1).
The first peak of each series of impulses, in all but one
case, reached the highest voltage. The voltage amplitude
subsequently dropped in all cases in a smooth curve, although in
trains greater than ten impulses, the voltage fluctuated later in
the train (Figure 4,5).
Peak voltage varied between rays but there was also some
relation to the size of the ray (Figure 1). The largest voltage
recorded was 36.74 Volts, from the largest ray. It also seems
that the amplitude of the peak voltage is correlated with the
length of the train, within the trials of each ray (Figure 2).
For example, the smallest ray, 16 om measured from wing tip to
wing tip, generated a train of only three spikes with a peak of
18.84 Volts, while the longest train from that ray, 28 spikes,
generated only 9.98 Volts.
Amperage recorded from animals under water averaged
0.038t0.025 amps for the 16 cm ray and 0.13710.117 amps for the 17
E ray.
Single Column Recording:
Upon ascertaining that the tissue was alive , recordings were
taken during 80 Hertz trains of stimuli (0.5 ms in duration, 12 V
amplitude) applied to the nerve. The resulting post-synaptic
response frequently displayed marked increase in peak amplitude
during the stimulus (Figure 8). The increase in amplitude of the
post-synaptic potential increased by between -6.6 percent to 700
