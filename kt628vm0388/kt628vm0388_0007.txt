254.5153.3 ms, followed by a short rest, 109.03t42.3 ms, and then
another brief train, 195.8149.6 ms, was applied at the same
frequency. The amplitudes of the first two peaks and last peak
during each train was recorded in order-to ascertain whether there
was any change in the amplitude of the post-synaptic potential.

Conditioning
After pairing the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned
stimulus (UCS) for approximately 30 minutes, a single CS without
the USC elicited no response. When the UCS was applied to the
ground beside the ray, a shock was elicited similar to those
elicited by thumps to the wing. This only occurred on the
stimulus immediately following a true thump, and on no subsequent
stimuli. At times, the ray did not respond to the CS/UCS pairing
with a characteristic shock train. This seemed to happen toward
the end of the testing period.
Alarm Shock Masurement:
This experiment produced accurate voltage amplitude
measurements on the three rays.
Warning shocks produced by the
rays in these trials usually consisted of long trains of brief
spikes (Figure 4), the trains averaging 19.36t14.3 spikes in
length with a latency between the first two spikes of 13.112.1 ms.
The time between individual peaks in a single shock train was very
regular although some trains consisted of two phases of differing
-6-
