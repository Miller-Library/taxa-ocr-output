Introduction
he possession of electric organs by fresh water as well as
salt water fish is well documented. Electric fields are used by
fish for various purposes, including electrolocation and prey
capture (Kalmijn 1966). The Electric eel, (Electrophorus
electricus) is a common species that is able to use its electric
organ to capture prey (Bennett, 1971). A similar type of electric
organ is found in the Pacific electric ray, Torpedo californica.
The organs are composed of specialized muscle cells, called
electrocytes, arranged in columns (Bennett, et al. 1961). Each
cell in a column is innervated on the ventral side by numerous
nerves which simultaneously discharge, releasing the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synapse. This opens ion
channels in the cell wall, creating a massive influx of ions into
the cell. Simultaneously, the resistance of the dorsal membrane is
lowered. The sum of all these mechanisms generates current
(Aidley 1978, Bennett 1970). Shocks as large as 50 Volts and 50
amps have been recorded (Fong, 1981).
Torpedos can use their electric organs for two purposes, as a
warning to intruders, and as a means of capturing prey. Although
these seem to be separate activities, they may in fact be two
different aspects of the same action. Each electric organ is
innervated by three large trunks, as in Narcine, which is also a
torpedinid (Bennett, 1971). These large trunks branch into
smaller nerves which branch profusely and terminate on the ventral
membrane of the electrocytes. Each electrocyte is innervated by
-2.
