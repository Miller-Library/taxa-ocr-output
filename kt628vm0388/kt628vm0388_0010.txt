from the stimulus to the action potential. The measured value is
2.27 m/s.
Discussion
Conditioning:
It is apparent that the ray used in the conditioning
experiment did not become conditioned to the electrical stimulus.
It did, however, become sensitized to the mechanical thump of the
stimulus pole. It may be that the visual presence and the
actually mechanical thump of the pole where overwhelming stimuli,
such that the ray became conditioned to the UCS rather than the
CS. The ray also would periodically not respond to the stimulus
at all, i.e. it would emit no shock. In those cases, the ray may
have become habituated to the UCS, and the visual presence of the
pole. However, this was not tested substantially.
It is unlikely that the ray cannot detect the electric
stimulus at all, since it is well documented that elasmobranchs
are capable of detecting electric fields. Further testing of the
ability of these rays to detect electric fields is warranted.
Alarm Shock Measurement
It is apparent that Torpedo is capable of generating at least
36 Volts of electricity with its electric organs. Upon viewing
figure 1, it seems that the average peak voltage of each ray is
linearly related to the size of the ray. The sampling pool for
this experiment is rather small due to a dearth in experimental
