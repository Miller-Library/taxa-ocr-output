Vessel Anatomy/Diameters
Each head was dissected extensively to follow all vessels of interest. One
orbital rete was extracted from each specimen and sectioned. Vessel diameters
were measured both superficially and in cross section using an optical
micrometer.
Diameters of the red muscle vein were obtained from cross sections. To
estimate the relative amount of red muscle at a given body length, the red
muscle of successive steaks was isolated and weighed, adjusting for width of
the steak.
RESULTS

Cranial Anatomy
Cranial anatomy was found to be tailored to the presence of an orbital
rete on each side of the cranium. (Refer to Figure 2 for a diagrammatic
representation of the arterial system.) Both arterial contributors to the rete
arise from the first efferent branchial artery. At its origin, the pseudobranchial
artery is at least as large as this source. After passing laterally over the
hyomandibular cartilage and then between the cranial wall and the quadrate
process of the jaw, an average diameter above 2 mm was measured. (Vessel
diameters reported here are a consensus from the three specimens. See Figure 3
for individual results) No curvature is apparent until the vessel has reached the
spiracular pocket, where it successively branches into five to seven vessels that
curve dorsally, forming the pseudobranch plexus. These 1.5 mm vessels
quickly return ventrally, converge in an analogous fashion, and continue as one
vessel of diameter 2.5 mm. After approximately four large curves, this vessel
divides and begins the orbital rete, the cohesive meshwork of winding
arterioles lying within the orbital sinus (Fig. 4). Proceeding anteriorly, the
