A previous study found lamnid sharks to have a range of vessel
diameters for the orbital rete from 600-800um to 150-300um, posterior to
anterior. The vessels of one 114 cm porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) ranged
from 750 um to 300 um in the pseudobranchial plexus (Block & Carey, 1985).
Corresponding diameters for the three salmon shark specimens were generally
larger, at least at the posterior end, with LD1 diameters ranging from 1220 +
310um to 300 + 70um, LD2 from 2180 + 650um to 490 + 50um, and LD4
from 1220 + 260 to 300 + 120. Though LD1 and LD2 were, larger sharks than
the porbeagle (15 and 30 cm longer, respectively), LD4 was 22 cm shorter.
It is customary to link larger vessel size with diminished capacity for
heat exchange. However, other variables such as overall rete size or vessel wall
diameter were not taken into consideration. Additionally, there is a tradeoff
between heat exchange and unwanted oxygen exchange that depends on vessel
diameter. (Carey, 1982). Finding an optimum balance for heat exchange may
depend on unmeasured factors such as blood velocity or possible temperature
effects on hemoglobin (Carey, 1982).
The cranium can receive heat from a variety of locations. The red color
of the eye muscle has been noted by Wolf et al. as an indication of increased
oxidative fibers. These aerobic eye muscles probably contribute heat directly to
the orbital sinus in which they lie (Wolf et al., 1988). Nearby jaw muscle was
also observed to be red and of considerable size, perhaps helping warm the
general area. The brain itself is metabolically active, potentially heat-producing,
and drained by the cerebral veins which lead to the sinus. Finally, the red
muscle vein of L. ditropis may add a degree of endothermy to the cranium by
bringing heat directly from the warmest region of the bodyâ€”the swimming
musculature (Wolf, et al. 1988). There is little reason, other than to provide
heat, for the venous net surrounding the brain to be of such significant size. It
