was confirmed that the red muscle vein exists only within regions of
considerable red muscle, supporting its proposed purpose of transporting
thermal energy only from the warmest region of the body.
It will not be long before morphometric information on L. ditropis will
be supplemented by cranial temperature readings and information on the
extent of ambient thermal preferences. Three Pop-Up-Tags will be deployed
on salmon sharks in Alaska in June of 1997.
CONCLUSTONS
It is believed that the cranial, orbital rete, and red muscle vein anatomy
of the three salmon shark specimens, in combination with previous reports of
a warm body, are more than sufficient to indicate that Lamna ditropis has a
high degree of endothermy in the brain and eye.
