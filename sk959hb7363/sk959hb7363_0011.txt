Figure 1: Top: LD2 before dissection. Bottom: Injection of the right
pseudobranchial artery with red latex.
Figure 2: Arterial system of the L. ditropis cranium: Diagrammatic outline of
the arterial system as it pertains to the orbital rete. Note that colors
designate temperature, not arteries and veins. Blood from the efferent
branchial arteries enters the orbital rete via the pseudobranchial artery and
the anterior carotid artery. There it is warmed by counter-current heat
exchange with venous blood (not shown).
Figure 3: Diameters of the stapedial and pseudobranchial plexus of the orbital
rete, posterior to anterior. Note that a decrease in vessel size is associated
with an increase in the number of arteries. Error bars denote standard
deviation of the sampled vessels. In areas with only a single cross-sectional
vessel, the S.D. reflects repeated measurements of the same vessel within one
cm.
Figure 4: Top: Dissection exposing right orbital rete of LD2. Bottom:
Doubly-injected left orbital rete extracted from LD2. PP pseudobranchial
plexus; SP stapedial plexus; PA pseudobranchial artery; OA optic artery; AE
arterial exit to anterior and posterior cerebral arteries; VE venous entry from
cerebral veins.
Figure 5: Radiograph of LD2 with jaws and excess tissue removed. Note
prominent left and right pseudobranchial plexus of the orbital retia.
