pseudobranchial plexus; SP stapedial plexus.
Figure 7: Pertinent measurements from LD2 and LD4 radiographs.
Figure 8: Top: Cross-sections from LD4 pseudobranchial plexus, posterior
(left) to anterior (right). Bottom: close-up of LD2 cross-section, showing
thick arterial walls connected by a sparse net of tissue. Venous blood (blue
latex) is unencumbered by vessel walls.
Figure 9: Diameters of the red muscle vein before and after entering the neural
canal of the spinal cord. S.D. bars reflect repeated measurements of the vein
within one cm. Amount of red muscle is an arbitrarily scaled measure of the
quantity of red muscle at the corresponding point where the vessel diameter
was taken.
