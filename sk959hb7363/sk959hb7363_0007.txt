The orbital rete lies completely within the orbital sinus (Block, personal
observation). This cavity is of greatest size near the eye and extends posteriorly
beside the rete. to eventually join the jugular vein (Burne, 1923). Venous
injection of the sinus via the myelonal vein was unsatisfactory.
Red Muscle Vein Anatomy
The red muscle vein was found to begin posteriorly only after the red
muscle had reached a significant size, and to enter the neural canal anteriorly
before the red muscle tapered away â€” at about the level of the last gill slit (Fig
9). Its diameter steadily increases to about 3.5 mm just before entering the
neural canal and joining with the myelonal vein. This vein follows the neural
canal into the cranium, at which point it joins the net of veins covering the
brain and finally drains into the orbital sinus.
DISCUSSION
Previous examination of 18 species of sharks has shown that warm
brains and eyes occur only in sharks that have an orbital rete (Block & Carey,
1985). The presence of a well developed orbital rete in Lamna ditropis therefore
strongly suggests that it is warming its brain and eyes. The rete is positioned
to intercept cool, oxygenated blood from the gills before it is distributed in
the cranium. In the rete, the high surface area afforded by the dividing and
coiling arterioles is well suited for counter-current heat exchange. Venous
blood flowing in the opposite direction is unencumbered by vessel walls,
bounded only by the mesentery encircling the rete. By having this stream of
warm venous blood pass directly over the arterioles while a separate stream fills
the remainder of the orbital sinus, a system of double insulation is
approximated. Isolation and efficiency of heat exchange may be increased by
this arrangement.
