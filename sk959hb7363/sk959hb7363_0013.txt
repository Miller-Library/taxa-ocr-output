ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Numerous people have contributed immensely to this Hopkins research
project. I sincerely thank my advisor, Barbara Block, for her enthusiasm,
expertise, and confidence that I could fit 50 slides into a 15 minute talk. Beth
Condie was an incredible lab partner and I was lucky to have her help. I would
like to thank Dr. Tom Williams and his veterinary staff for allowing me to take
x-rays of an unlikely pet. I greatly appreciate the additional help of Henry
Mollet, Chuck Farwell, Carol Reeb, Ellen Freund, Heidi Dewar, Chris Patton,
and the Hopkins Marine Station staff.
