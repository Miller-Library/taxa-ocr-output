number of vessels approaches 100, and the diameters progressively decrease to
0.4 mm. Within a given cross section, vessels show little variation in size and
are evenly distributed, except at the beginning of the rete where diameters are
large.
The second tributary of the orbital rete begins as the efferent hyoidean,
arising from the efferent branchial artery below the pseudobranchial origin.
This artery travels across the basal plate in small curves, occasionally doubling
back on itself, with a relatively constant diameter near or below 1.5 mm. At the
orbital fenestra it divides. The internal carotid passes through the cranium into
the brain, while the stapedial branch passes into the fenestra and quickly
divides. The rete it forms lies between the pseudobranchial portion of the
orbital rete and the cranial wall. It is similar to, but smaller than its neighbor,
with vessel diameters decreasing to 0.35 mm at the anterior end.
Small arteries leave the rete for the eye, eye muscle, and mandible, but
the majority of blood (estimated by cross-sectional vessel area) leaves via a
gathering of arterioles at the far anterior end of the rete. These become the
cerebral arteries that, along with the internal carotid, supply the brain.
Ventro-dorsal and lateral x-rays of the brain precisely illustrate the extent
of the orbital rete, since the surrounding tissue remains undisturbed
(Figs. 5 & 6). The largest rete measures 9.5 cm from the beginning of the
pseudobranchial plexus to the anterior end. Figure 7 contains additional
measurements from the radiographs.
Vessels within the orbital rete are bathed in venous blood. That is,
arterial blood is only separated from venous blood by the media and adventitia
of the arterial walls, though they are relatively thick. A sparse web of tissue
connects arterial walls to one another or to the thin mesentery that
encapsulates the rete (Fig. 8).
