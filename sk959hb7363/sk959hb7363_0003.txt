(Carey et al., 1985). Recent research has confirmed these anatomical findings
and additionally identified an extensive kidney rete (Condie, unpublished).
These retia minimize the heat losses associated with breathing through
water. Since water has 1/40th the oxygen content and 30 times the heat
capacity of air, blood sent to the gills to be oxygenated also reaches thermal
equilibrium with the water (Carey, 1982). Retia function as virtual thermal
barriers, transferring heat away from unoxygenated blood before it is cooled in
the gills. Counter-current heat exchange maximizes efficiency to near 97% (for
the bluefin tuna, Carey, 1982), allowing fish like L. ditropis to maintain
observed temperature elevations. The accompanying advantages are potentially
great. The salmon shark almost certainly benefits from an expanded thermal
niche and increased aerobic capacity (Block & Finnerty, 1994).
No temperature measurements have been taken in the cranial region of
the salmon shark, but there is reason to believe fish would warm their brains
and eyes as well. Critical functions including nerve transmission, learned
behavior, and visual acuity are likely affected by temperature (Linthicum &
Carey, 1972). In addition, specific anatomical features for both preserving and
contributing heat have been associated with endothermy of the brain and eye.
It is hypothesized that determining the presence of these key morphological
features will afford an estimate of the salmon sharkâ€™s cranial endothermy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three salmon sharks were obtained for study, hereafter referred to as
LDI, LD2, and LD4. LD1 and LD2 were captured in gill nets by the Monterey
Fishing Company, while LD4 was found beached in Monterey Bay. All had
localized handling wounds but were otherwise in excellent condition, showing
