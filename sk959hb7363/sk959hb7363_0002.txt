ABSTRACT
Geographic range, extent of red muscle, supra-hepatic rete size, and
limited temperature measurements have placed the salmon shark, Lamna
ditropis, as the warmest of the lamnid sharks. Yet its anatomy has remained
largely undescribed, and measurements of brain or eye temperatures in
particular have not been taken. In this study, three specimens were examined
to determine if the morphological requirements for a warm brain and eyes are
present. In addition to local heat-producing red muscle of the eye and jaw,
other notable features were found. A well-developed orbital rete lies within a
venous sinus on both sides of the cranium. Cool, oxygenated blood from the
gills can pass through the dividing vessels of this exchanger before reaching the
brain or eyes. Since venous blood in the sinus flows opposite the arterial
blood, counter-current heat exchange can occur. A vein originating in the red
swimming muscle potentially contributes to the warmth of the venous sinus
by supplying blood directly from the warmest part of the shark. Before
collecting in the orbital sinus, this red muscle vein bathes the brain in warm
blood. These morphological data suggest the salmon shark has a significant
capacity to warm the brain and eyes.
INTRODUCTION
Temperature measurements have shown that the salmon shark (Lamna
ditropis, Hubbs and Follet, 1947) is one of very few fish and only seven sharks
able to elevate its body temperature above that of the surrounding water.
Differences of 8 to 11 Â°C between body core and ambient waters have been
measured (Smith, 1983), lending credence to the theory that the extent of the
red muscle, muscle retia, and supra-hepatic rete indicate degree of endothermy
