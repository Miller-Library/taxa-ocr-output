Latex Injections
Radio-opaque latex was used as an aid in dissection and visualization.
All injection was accomplished using Microfil Injection Compounds MV-120
(blue) and MV-130 (red). The suggested component ratios were modified
slightly to extend working time past ½ hour.
In order to inject the arterial system of the cranium, a window was
opened large enough to expose the pseudobranchial artery where it is closest to
the skin — at the point where it passes laterally over the hyomandibular
cartilage (Fig. 1). For LD1, 8 mL of latex were sufficient to inject the entire
cranium from one side. (Volumes exclude losses in the syringe and catheter,
but may include leakage.) LD2 and LD4 required injection from both sides,
requiring 8.5 and 3 mL for the former and 7.2 and 1.8 mL for the latter.
The venous system was injected from the origin of one of the two red
muscle veins in LD2 and LD4, using 38 and 8 mL of latex, respectively. The
second red muscle vein remained uninjected in LD2 and was back-injected
with 2 mL of latex at the point of its entry into the spinal cord.
Radiographs
The heads of LD2 and LD4 were x-rayed after decapitation. LD2 was x-
rayed again after removal of the jaws, and again after removal of excess tissue.
