Discussion:
Continuous bright light recording
The continuous bright light recording in the controlled environment of the
chilled seawater tank provides data on the free-running period of the colonies, the
endogenous cycle which occurs when environmental time cues (Zeitgebers) are
removed. This data shows a strong endogenous cycle of behaviour, but does not
support à free-running circadian behaviour. The periods ranging from 17-39 hours,
though, can incorporate Riise’s observation of a 27 hour period.
Additionally, as is suggested in Table 1, the periodicity should be judged on the
basis of anthocodia retraction, or secondarily, capitulum contraction. The duration of
time between anthocodia retraction and capitulum contraction is virtually constant in an
individual, and the period judged by anthocodia retraction is very rhythmic. However,
the periods judged by anthocodia extension are only vaguely periodic, agreeing well
with the observation that the anthocodia retraction is coordinated and simultaneous,
while anthocodia extension is more individual lacking evidence of central control. The
durations of expanded and closed postures seem to be substantially more variable than
the periodicity judged by the anthocodia retraction, but do corroborate Riise's finding
of a 60:40 time ratio between expanded and closed postures.
Bright light treatment, while providing free-running oscillation data, has the
disadvantage of adding photic stress as well as thermal stress to the colonies. In other
creatures, continuous bright light has been show to lengthen periodic behaviour cycles,
(Parker, 1974), and a similar alteration may be occuring here.
