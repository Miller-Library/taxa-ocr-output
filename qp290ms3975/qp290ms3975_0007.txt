The conditions of this experiment were designed to duplicate light conditions
for the shallower members of A. ritterii, as well as a shallow-water relative, A.
grandflorus, which inhabits depths of 20m-200m off the South African coast [Nutting,
1908]. A. grandflorus could use light change as a Zeitgeber to perform a circadian
rhythm, and were this true, A. ritterii could show a similar behaviour despite its lack of
exposure to light change. The data for this experiment, though, does not support any
change in periodicity for A. ritterii.
Feeding study
These organisms, from Riise's assessment, are filter feeders, ingesting small
planktonic species. Because of the well-documented circatidal planktonic migration
rhythm, and additionally because feeding can form a common Zeitgeber, observations
were recorded under a periodic feeding schedule. Once again, because of the depth of
habitat, A. ritterii are not exposed to the planktonic migration to any significant degree.
This data, as with the LD 12:12 cycle, showed no change in the periodicity for A.
ritterii.
â€¢ Juvenile study
This study showed the same behaviour as seen in the adults under constant
bright light, but with a markedly shorter period than that found in any of the adults.
