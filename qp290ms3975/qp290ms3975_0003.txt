using controlled environmental stimuli. My research supports only part of Riise's
supposition: individual colonies of A. ritterii have a very precise endogenous rhythm
of anthocodia contraction/expansion, but the free-running rhythm, the cycle displayed
in the absence of environmental time cues, is highly variable between individuals and
does not necessarily approach a diel or tidal periodicity. My attempts to alter the
periodicity of the colonies were not successful, leaving the endogenous rhythm even
more intriguing.
