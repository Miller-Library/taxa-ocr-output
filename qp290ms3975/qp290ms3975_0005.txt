Results:
The results for the constant light recording are detailed in Table 1. Notable is
the wide range of periods, from 16.8 hours to 38.8 hours, as well as the precision of
the rhythm, with variation in individual colonies of only. 45 hours to 1.46 hours.
The alternating periods of bright light and dark (LD 12:12), the periodic feeding
study, and the mechanical stimulation did not succeed in altering the periodicity of the
Anthomastus colonies. The colonies maintained roughly the same periods as in the
constant bright light, and hence, this data has not been repeated.
The data for the juvenile has been included in Table 1 to facilitate comparison.
Notable is its much shorter periodicity of 7.7 hours, as well as the precise time-
measuring, varying only .52 hours.
