Materials and Methods:
The set of experiments discussed below were undertaken with a set of ten
separate colonies obtained using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI) remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Samples were obtained from depths
between 670m-700m, at a site near Soquel Canyon (37°12N, 122°03W). The
colonies were then placed in a large tank with continuously flowing seawater chilled to
5°C. Observations were recorded using time-lapse video recording. The series of
experiments are detailed below:
Continuous bright light recording.
Alternating bright light/dark periods (LD 12:12)
The colonies were left in bright light and dark for alternating periods of 12
hours each. Light period observations were done using time-lapse video
recording; dark period data were recorded by direct observation at 2 hour
intervals using red light.
Feeding study
The colonies were fed three to four drops of homogenized krill approximately
every 25 hours.
Mechanical stimulation
Using forceps, the colonies were triggered into retracting their anthocodia. This
stimulation was done every 24 hours.
• Young colony study-continuous bright light
This study employed a colony which had settled approximately three months
prior, and had three autozooids.
