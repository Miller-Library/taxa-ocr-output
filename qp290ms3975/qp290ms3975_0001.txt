Abstract:
Endogenous rhythm study on deep sea organisms has been very limited in the
past. In this light, he suggestion by Riise of a circadian or circatidal rhythm in the soft
coral Anthomastus ritterii becomes extremely interesting. The purpose of this study
was to verify this hypothesis as well as to entrain the creatures to a controlled thythmic
stimuli. The data collected does not verify that hypothesis, but interestingly enough,
does point to an endogenous rhythm. The colonies appear to be quite periodic, but
follow a highly individual cycle, with period times ranging from 16.8 hours to 38.8
hours. The cycle seems to be unperturbed by controlled environmental cues such as
light, feeding, and mechanical distrubance. Study of a juvenile with a radically shorter
period of 7.7 hours suggests important changes in development with respect to this
periodicity.
