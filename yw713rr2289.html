TAKEN NEAR MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA; RELATION TO LOCAL SEWAGE
OUTFALLS
HENRY HOWARD STIBBS
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, California
Ascidians are known to concentrate such heavy metals as
titanium, vanadium, niobium, and chromium in levels that tremen-
dously exceed the concentrations of these elements in the surround-
ing seawater (Webb, 1939; Bertrand, 1950; Carlisle, 1958; Le-
vine, 1962). Chromium is a common constituent of industrial
sewage, and it may at times constitute part of domestic sewage.
Monterey, Bay, California, has a number of both industrial and
domestic sewage outfalls. Using atomic absorption spectropho-
tometry, a study was made of the chromium content of ascidians
living in the Monterey area to determine the chromium levels
present in different species and to see whether intraspecific
variations in chromium content might be correlated with the lo-
cations of selected sewage outfalls.
MATERIALS and METHODS
Eighteen species of ascidians were taken from the follow-
ing four locations near Monterey: the floats at the marina in
Monterey harbor; the rocky shore by the Hopkins Marine Station
in Pacific Grove; the rocky shore at Point Pinos, Pacific
Grove, 50 to 100 feet from the opening of the city sewage outfall;
and the rocky shore south of the mouth of the Carmel River,
2
500 to 1000 feet from the opening of the city of Carmel
sewage outfall. No ascidians were found living less than 50 feet
from the Pacific Grove outfall and 500 feet from the Carmel
outfall, although the rocks nearer to the outfalls appeared,
but for the sewage, very suitable for ascidian habitation.
Living solitary and colonial ascidians were picked clean
of gross extraneous material and placed in finger bowls
filled with millipore-filtered seawater to allow the gut to
clear. The water was changed 2-3 times daily and the bowls
maintained at about 14°0. The intestines of the ascidians were
usually empty of feces within 48 hours, but some of the smaller
ascidians (e.g., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Clavelina huntsmani : Exact'>Clavelina huntsmani)</span> closed their siphons in
filtered seawater and never thoroughly evacuated. The large
solitary ascidians (e.g., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Styela : Exact'>Styela,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ciona : Exact'>Ciona,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ascidia : Exact'>Ascidia)</span> gener-
ally proved much hardier than the smaller colonial species.
After the ascidians were removed from the filtered seawater,
all external adhering material was picked and scraped from
the tunics as thoroughly as possible. An approximate wet
weight was obtained, then the ascidians were either chopped up
by hand or ground for several minutes in a Waring blendor. The
chopped or ground samples were placed in 50 ml beakers and
dried for 12-18 hr at 110°C to constant weight. A dry weight
(to the nearest mg) was obtained for each sample. Samples were
then ashed in a muffle furnace at 450°C for 8-12 hrs (24 hrs
at 475°C for some samples, see Table 1) and weighed again.
Aliquots of the ashed samples (usually O.5 g) were taken,
weighed (to the nearest mg) in 15 ml beakers, and 3 ml of aqua
261
regia were added to each beaker. Samples were heated to
dryness over a steam bath. Next, 2-3 ml of cold, concen-
trated (30%) hydrogen peroxide were added to each beaker, and
the samples were again completely evaporated over a steam bath.
Finally, 3 ml of aqua regia were added to each sample and this
evaporated as before. All samples contained distinct crystals
of digested material at this time.
Samples were redissolved in 10 ml of O.1 N HCl (prepared
with deionized distilled water). This solution was poured
into a 50 ml beaker. An additional 10 ml of the O.1 N HCI
was used to rinse the 15 ml beaker, and this was also added
to the 50 ml beaker. This 20 ml of solution, which often
contained considerable undigested material, was filtered through
5 Whatman filter paper to remove macroscopic suspended mater-
ial and larger pieces of sand and unidentified micaceous grit.
An additional 5 ml of O.1 N HCl was used to rinse the 50 ml
beaker and was filtered with the rest of the sample.
The 25 ml of filtrate representing each sample was col-
lected in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask and tested for chromium
using a Perkin-Elmer Model 303 atomic absorption spectropho-
tometer equipped with a three-slot burner head and an air-
acetylene flame. The detection limit of this instrument is
about 0.004 ppm chromium and the sensitivity (concentration
needed to produce 1% absorption) was sometimes as great as
0.0713 ppm chromium. Standard solutions, containing 1, 5, 10,
15, and 20 ppm chromium, were made up using a Beckman stock
solution of 1000 ppm chromium (prepared especially for atom-
ic absorption procedures), diluted with the same O.1 N HCI
solution that was used in making up the samples. Working
curves, showing absorbance (derived from per cent absorp
tion) plotted against ppm chromium, were used in determining
concentrations of chromium in the samples. Appendix 1 shows
one of the working curves obtained from the chromium standards.
Fresh standard solutions were made up and tested prior to ana-
lysing each group of ascidian samples. Since each 0.5 g ashed
aliquot was dissolved in 25 ml of solution, the sample concen-
trations read off the working curves were multiplied by 50 in
order to obtain values in parts per million per gram of ash.
Since glassware at the Hopkins Marine Station is cleaned
with a solution of potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid,
all of the beakers, flasks, and pipets used in these experi-
ments were submerged in a solution of concentrated nitric and
sulfuric acids for 15 minutes, then rinsed 6 times with tap-
water, in order to prevent any chromium contamination.
Control samples were prepared and tested for chromium to
ascertain that no contamination was occurring at any stage of
sample preparation. Tapwater, deionized water,aand the O.1 N
HCl (the "blank") were all tested with the spectrophotometer
and found to lack chromium. A 50 ml beaker was spared the usual
washing with concentrated acid and filled with 25 ml of the
0.1 N HCl; this control, which might have shown contamination
resulting from the washing procedure at the Hopkins Marine
Station, also exhibited no chromium content when tested. One
beaker was run through the gamut of sample preparation proce-
dures and found to contain no chromium. Finally, the aqua re-
2d
gia was tested and it, too, showed a lack of chromium.
Neither the acid solution used in washing the glassware
nor the concentrated hydrogen peroxide were run through
the spectrophotometer, however.
Samples of sewage effluent were obtained from local
sewage treatment plants (Monterey, Pacific Grove, and Car-
mel) and analysed for chromium using the method of additions.
In this procedure, matrix interference is obviated by adding
increasing amounts of chromium to a series of sewage samples;
the atomic absorption readings are plotted against the
chromium additions (Figures 1-4), and the line connecting
the points extrapolated to the abscissa. The distance of
this intersection to the left of the zero point of additions
on the abscissa represents the chromium concentration in the
unadulterated sample.
RESULTS and DISCUSSION
Monterey sewage sampled on May 29, 1970, contained
approximately 0.008 ppm of chromium (Figure 1). No chromium
was detected in the sewage effluents of Pacific Grove and
Carmel (Figures 2 and 3). Seawater taken from the east shore
of the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove contained
0.095 ppm of chromium (Figure 4). The open ocean contains
about 0.00005 ppm of chromium (Goldberg, 1963).
Chromium levels found in the eighteen species of ascidians
tested are tabulated in Appendix 2 and summarized in Table 1.

the highest levels of chromium. These genera are all members
of the Order <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplousobranchia : Exact'>Aplousobranchia;</span> this fact is of particular
interest, since the ascidians showing high levels of vanadium
fall mainly in the Order <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phlebobranchia : Exact'>Phlebobranchia</span> (Webb, 1939; Bertrand,
1950). Within Orders and Families of ascidians there is consid-
erable variation in the tendency to concentrate chromium. How-
ever, all samples of Eudistoma species contained relatively
high concentrations of chromium, whereas samples of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Amaroucium : Exact'>Amaroucium</span>
species were consistently lower. The levels found in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Eudistoma ritteri : Exact'>Eudistoma
ritteri</span> (zooids plus tunic) are somewhat lower than those ob-
tained by Levine (1961), who found 72-144 ppm (dry weight) for
whole zooids, and 100 ppm for zooid abdomens only.
It is apparent (Table 1) that chromium levels in ascidians
taken near sewage outfalls were generally lower than those in
ascidians collected in an area considered unpolluted (Mussel
Point, Hopkins Marine Station). In the case of the ascidians
taken from the region of the Carmel outfall (indicated by an
asterisk in Table 1), it is possible that the low levels reflect
a difference in procedure. These animals were prepared in the
same general way as the others, but were ashed for 24 hours
at 475°C instead of the usual 8-12 hours at 450°0, and the
low chromium values here may be due to vaporization of some
chromium-containing component of the ash. Since these values
appear abnormally low, they are not considered further here.

Point Pinos generally tend to contain less chromium than do those
on Mussel Point by the Hopkins Marine Station. It is possible
that this tendency is due to the higher concentration of chromium
in the seawater off Mussel Point. Water here, however, was not
compared to seawater in other localities. It is also possible
that Pacific Grove sewage effluent has some influence on the
ability of Point Pinos ascidians to concentrate chromium. Al-
though it has been shown to lack detectable amounts of this
heavy metal, Pacific Grove sewage effluent flows into the ocean
as fresh water 1-2°C warmer than the seawater at Point Pinos.
Furthermore, in the period of the present study this sewage
at the outfall itself was found to contain residual chlorine
levels up to 45 ppm. Perhaps one or more of the components of this
sewage lowers the chromium-concentrating capacity of the Point
Pinos ascidians. Another possibility is that the plankton con-
sumed by the ascidians is being affected by the sewage. While
the exact mechanism by which ascidians concentrate heavy metals
is still debatable, it has been suggested that since chromium
exists in such low concentrations in the open ocean, ascidians
may acquire this metal in a preconcentrated form in their
plankton meals (Levine, 1962).
SUMMARY
1. Eighteen species of ascidians taken near Monterey, Cal-
ifornia, were analysed for chromium content using atomic absorp-
tion spectrophotmetry.
2. The highest values (ppm dry weight) were found in the
genera Eudistoma <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>(E. psammion,</span> 152.5; <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E. ritteri,</span> 25.6; <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E.
molle,</span> 15.0), Synoicum, (Synoicum par-fustus, 83.6), and
Ritterella <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>(R. pulchra,</span> 69.6; <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>R. rubra,</span> 45.2). All are mem-
bers of the Order Aplousobranchia. The lowest value was ob-
tained in Styela montereyensis (1.59 ppm dry weight). Seawater
taken by the Hopkins Marine Station yielded a value of 0.095
ppm.
3. The chromium content of ascidians found near local
domestic sewage outfalls was often lower than that of ascidians
found in less polluted areas. The chromium concentration in
three different samples of domestic sewage effluent (ranging
from 0.000 to 0.008 ppm) was much lower than that in seawater
from Monterey Bay.(0.095 ppm).
