is effected by dilution with sea water. The hypochlorit
effect on sperm appears to be slightly reversible if the
sperm are treated with sodium thiosulfate before fertilization.
However, this apparent reversibility could result from
removing a chlorine effect on the egg-sperm association
at fertilization. Irregular fertilization with centrifuged
control sperm make testing this effect directly more
difficult.
The effect of a given treatment on fertilization b
different dilutions of sperm is of great interest and also
of ecological importance. Thus, exposure of sperm to O.19 ppm
available chlorine (Table 4) shows the percent fertilization
success at 0.33%, 0.19% and 0.033% sperm concentrations
to be 94, 45 and 7 respectively. As seen in Table 1,
a similar relation between inhibition level and sperm
concentration was observed at appropriate unchlorinated
sewage concentrations. This effect is far greater than
the respiratory dilution effect described by Tyler and
Tyler (1966); it is typical of results obtained using other
fertilization inhibitors as discribed by Metz (1966).
I interpret this sharp reduction in success as the requirement
for a fiven level of "inactivation factor" per sperm
before fertilization is affected; thus, any slight increase
in inhibitor concentration or decrease in sperm concentration
would affect fertilization once this critical level is
