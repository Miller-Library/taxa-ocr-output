reached. The reversibility effect noted above for
unchlorinated sewage is consistent with this interpretation.
Further tests of the usefulness of hypochlorite and
thiosulfate in rate studies, such as performed by Baker and
Presley (1969) to elucidate intermediate steps in
fertilization, need to be performed. Neutralization of
hypochlorite can be effected with sodium thiosulfate.
which in turn has no effect on eggs, sperm or fertilization.
These characteristics of the hypochlorite â€” thiosulfate
pair suit them particularly well to rate studies of
fertilization; preliminary work is promising in the regard.
The finding that a 1000 fold dilution of heavily
chlorinated domestic sewage can significantly reduce sea
urchin fertilization is of great ecological interest.
Under such conditions of chlorination the presumably safe
dilution of sewage nutrients and noxious components of
1 to 100 is unacceptable for successful fertilization ir
sea urchins.
