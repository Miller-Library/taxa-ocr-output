sewage, can affect fertilization. As such, chlorinated
sewage could have drastic ecological consequences.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Gametes were obtained by intracoelomic injection of
0.5 M KCl. Eggs were collected in sea water; seminal
fluid was collected dry. Sewage was obtained fresh at
9:00 AM each day. Eggs and/or sperm were treated in
various sewage or hypochlorite dilutions prior to insemination;
treatment time was 5 minutes unless otherwise stated.
Sperm concentrations of 0.33%, 0.10% and 0.033%, all
of which are sufficient for 100% fertilization in control
suspensions, were used for most experiments. Fertilization
success was determined after 20 minutes by scoring
presence or absence of the hyaline layer; samples of
approximately 200 eggs were counted.
In studies to determine the sensitivity of the
fertilization process to hypochlorite, aliquots of a
fertilized suspension were removed at intervals and
treated two seconds with sodium hypochlorite before the
addition of excess sodium thiosulfate. Temperature was
held at 15Â° C.
Available chlorine was assayed in sewage and
hypochlorite solutions using an iodometric method, adding
a known amount of sodium thiosulfate to the sample and
