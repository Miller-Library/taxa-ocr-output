INTRODUCTION
External fertilization is widely used by marine
organisms and may be especially susceptible to environmental
pollution. In the present study the effects of primary
treated sewage from Monterey, California and Pacific
Grove, California were observed on fertilization in the
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Tests
were run with unchlorinated sewage from both cities and
chlorinated sewage from Pacific Grove only. (Sewage from
these two cities is almost exclusively domestic waste;
few industries contribute to the effluent.) The inhibition
of fertilization by unchlorinated sewage is minimal when
compared to the striking inhibition caused by the heavily
chlorinated Pacific Grove sewage.
The action of chlorine on fertilization proved to
be of central interest, and tests using sodium hypochlorite
showed that this was the active inhibitory agent in
chlorinated sewage. Low concentrations of hypochlorite
rapidly (within one second) inactivate sea urchin sperm,
but do not affect the egg. Concentrations as low as O.04
parts per million (ppm) available chlorine, which
corresponds to a 1000 fold dilution of heavily chlorinated
