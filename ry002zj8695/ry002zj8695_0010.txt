ABSTRACT
Unchlorinated sewage is a relatively mild fertilization
inhibitor.
Chlorinated sewage is a very strong fertilization
inhibitor, and a concentration of available chlorine as
ow as 0.04 ppm can reduce fertilization.
The primary effect of both chlorinated and unchlorinated
sewage is on the sperm.
4) The effect of unchlorinated sewage is partially reversible.
The sodium hypochlorite â€” sodium thiosulfate pair is
potential tool in rate study determinations of fertilization.
