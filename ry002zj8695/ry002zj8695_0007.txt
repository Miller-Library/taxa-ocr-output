hypochlorite was made possible through neutralization
of the unreacted hypochlorite by addition of excess
sodium thiosulfate, an agent with no observable effect
on eggs, sperm or fertilization. Exposure of sperm for
1 second to 1.9 ppm available chlorine greatly reduces
fertilization as shown in Table 6: Table 7 shows a
preliminary study in which gametes were exposed for two
seconds to hypochlorite of concentration .76 ppm at
different times after insemination. The results show
that the sensitivity of the fertilization process to
hypochlorite becomes markedly reduced by 40 seconds after
insemination; more stringent work remains to be done.
Of ecological significance is the observation that
the potency of chlorinated sewage or a hypochlorite solution
as a fertilization inhibitor drops with time as shown in
Table 8. Bubbling air through fresh sewage dilutions for
three hours did not hasten the decompostion.
DISCUSSTON
Tests show that the effect of unchlorinated domestic
sewage on fertilization is relatively slight, especially
when compared to the effect of chlorinated sewage. Sperm
are considerably more susceptible than are eggs. The
inactivation is partially reversible with unchlorinated
sewage (providing lethal levels are avoided); reversibilit
