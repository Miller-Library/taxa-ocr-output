titrating the unreacted remainder with iodine solution
using a starch indicator. A disparity between known
hypochlorite concentrations and the available chlorine assay
values was found. This could be due to decomposition
of the hypochlorite or the result of reaction of the
hypochlorite with the sea water to which it was added.
Chlorine levels cited here are available chlorine values
as assayed.

As shown in Table 1, unchlorinated Monterey sewage
inhibits fertilization strongly at a concentration of 10%;
inhibition is less complete at 5% concentration. No attempt
was made to restore osmotic balance of sewage dilutions.
Unchlorinated Pacific Grove sewage is generally weaker as
a fertilization inhibitor. The composition of the sewage
is sufficiently variable to make the numbers in Table 1
typical rather than absolute; the concentration of sewage
sufficient to yield a given inhibition level may vary by
a factor of 1 from day to day.
That the effect of unchlorinated sewage is on the
sperm or the egg-sperm interaction is shown by experiments
in which eggs and sperm were separately treated. Eggs
were treated ten minutes in 10% sewage, washed and then
fertilized with untreated sperm. Fertilization success
