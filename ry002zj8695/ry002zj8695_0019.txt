TABLE LEGEND
Fertilization success after 5 minute
TABLE 1:
treatment of sperm in dilutions of Monterey and Pacific
Grove sewage is given in per cent values. Fertilization
with unwashed sperm was in sewage dilution; washed sperm
were used to fertilize in fresh seawater.
Drastically lower fertilization success is
TABLE 2:
seen with dilutions of chlorinated sewage (42.5 ppm
available chlorine). Treatment of the sewage with
sodium thiosulfate markedly reduced the inhibition of
fertilization.
TABLE 3:
Comparison of the inhibitory effect of the
same dilutions of chlorinated sewage (11.0 ppm available
chlorine) and hypochlorite in seawater (12.8 ppm available
chlorine) shows hypochlorite to be the major fertilization
inhibitor in chlorinated sewage.
Eggs treated in a 2% dilution of a hypochlorite
TABLE 4:
solution (38.5 ppm available chlorine) show no inhibition
after treatment and washing; sperm treated in lower
concentrations of hypochlorite solution show great
reduction of fertilization capacity
