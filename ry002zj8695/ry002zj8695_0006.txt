effects vary accordingly.
Further evidence of chlorine as the dominant inhibitor
in chlorinated sewage is seen in Table 3. In this
experiment hypochlorite was added to sea water to a level
comparable to that found in sewage. A sodium hypochlorite
solution of 12.8 ppm available chlorine was a slightly
better inhibitor than sewage with 11.0 ppm chlorine.
That the effect of chlorination is primarily on the
sperm and not the egg is seen in Table in which treated
ggs were inseminated with untreated sperm and vice versa.
Morphological study of treated sperm (5 minutes at 0.19 ppm.
indicates an increased tendency for the flagella to fall
off and the occasional presence of an unidentified fiber
of very small diameter attached to the sperm head. Whether
or not the acrosome is caused to evert is as yet unknown.
Adding sodium thiosulfate to sperm suspensions exposed
to 0.04, 0.08 and 0.21 ppm available chlorine for 5 minutes
and then fertilizing eggs with this sperm results in
improved fertilization success as shown in Table 5. This
could indicate some reversibility effect on the thiosulfate
teated sperm; I favor the alternate hypothesis that
hypochlorite might also have a deleterious effect of the
sperm-egg interaction.
An experiment was done to determine how long it takes
hypochlorite to inactivate sperm; very short exposure to
