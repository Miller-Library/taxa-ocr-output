was 100%. Attempts to wash treated sperm by centrifugation
at 3K rpm and resuspension in fresh sea water were
sporadically successful in that control sperm did not
always yield 100% fertilization. As shown in Table 1
when control sperm survived the treatment, fertilization
success for the centrifuged sperm was comparable to that
of unwashed treated sperm, further substantiating that the
effect is essentially on the sperm. Incubating sperm
for longer times resulted in corresponding lower fertilization
success.
The inactivation effect resulting from unchlorinated
sewage treatment can be partially reversed after treatment
by diluting the suspension with fresh sea water. A O.33%
sperm suspension treated 5 minutes in 5% sewage gave 7%
fertilization success. The same sperm, diluted 1:3 after
treatment gave 32% success despite dilution.
The far more drastic effect of chlorinated sewage
from Pacific Grove is shown in Table 2. As seen, even
0.2% chlorinated sewage is more detrimental to fertilization
than 10% unchlorinated sewage. That this is due to the
chlorine is supported by the additional data in Table 2;
when chlorinated sewage is treated with sodium thiosulfate
which reduces OCl to C1", the strength of the sewage as
an inhibitor falls to that of unchlorinated sewage. Chlorine
levels in the sewage vary from 15 to 45 ppm; the inhibition
