Four strains in the Pseudomonadacea family, and one in
the Enterobacteriacea family were found on the Pachygrapsus crassipes
embryos. Six strains from the Pseudomonadacea family were isolated
from the Pagurus samuelis embryos; three strains from the
Pseudomonadacea family, and one from the Enterobacteriacea family
were isolated from the Hopkinsia rosacea embryos.
Anti-fungal Properties
None of the 18 isolates inhibited hyphae growth. The
hyphae growth proceeded right up until the edge of the bacterial streak
in each case.
A problem with the L. callinectes culture obtained from
the ATCC was an association of bacteria with the culture. Growth of
the bacterial contaminant was apparently stimulated with any
perturbation of the fungal culture, i.e., when agar plugs were cut from
it, and transferred to new plates. It is difficult to ascertain whether the
contaminant may have affected the results.
Response to Antibiotic Treatment
Ten of thirteen of the strains showed sensitivity to
ampicillin, and thirteen of eighteen strains to penicillin G (table 3).
Some strains showed greater sensitivity than others, but any
noticeable inhibition is recorded as positive.
Effects of Removing Bacteria with Antibiotic
While seven of the eight strains isolated from
Pachygrapsus crassipes may have been sensitive to penicillin in the
antibiotic disc assay, penicillin did not reduce the bacterial density on
the Pachygrapsus crassipes egg surface. Using DAPI to stain the
penicillin G-soaked embryos, and comparing them to stained control
embryos, showed little difference in the density of bacteria on the
surface. As on the control embryos, the bacteria grew in patchy and
string-like colonies. This observation prompted a quantitative
