eighteen strains were streaked 5 mm away from the hyphae in order
to determine whether any of the isolated strains inhibited the growth
of L. callinectes. It was concluded that if the hyphae growth continued
to extend to the bacterial streak, then there was no inhibition (Figure
Bacterial Strain Response to Antibiotics
Each bacterial strain was used to inoculate 3 ml of agar.
The liquefied agar was immediately poured over solidified agar. Discs
containing antibiotics were placed on the overlay. The commercially
manufactured ampicillin discs contained 10 mcg of ampicillin. The
penicillin G discs were prepared by soaking filter paper discs in a 1 g/L
solution of penicillin G for one hour. Growth was checked at 48
hours. In the case that penicillin G inhibited bacterial growth, a
circular zone of inhibition was observed surrounding the disc (Figure
2). Bacterial growth that covered the plate, including the area of the
plate immediately surrounding the discs, marked a lack of inhibition,
a negative result in Table 3.
Antibiotic and Fungal Treatments
Eggs from five specimens of ovigerous Pachygrapsus
crassipes were examined microscopically, and those from different
mothers were found to be in various stages of development. The
female with embryos at the earliest stage of development was chosen
to be used experimentally.
These embryos had completed
gastrulation; the blastomeres were numerous, and there was a slight
withdrawal of blastomeres from one section of the capsule, revealing
perivitelline space. They lacked early appendages, heartbeats, or eye
spots. It was determined that they were approximately 5 days into
development (Hiatt, 1947)
Sterile tweezers were used to remove a cluster of
approximately 200-300 eggs from the female. Altogether, four clusters
were removed. Each cluster was placed in a separate vial within
separate beakers, filled with 900 ml of UVSW. The sides of the vials
