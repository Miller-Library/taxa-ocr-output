the penicillin G- treated were dead. 29% of the
penicillin+L.callinectes-treated were dead. None of the L.callinectes-
treated were dead. Development was not retarded in any case, in
those that remained alive (figures 3 - 6).
On day 13, 25% of the control embryos were dead, 42.5%
of the penicillin-soaked were dead, 45% of the penicillin+L.callinectesÂ¬
treated were dead, 17.5% of the L.callinectes-treated were dead.
Development appeared retarded in the penicillin+L.callinectes treated
embryos.
By day 18, 30.5% of the controls, and 73.3% of the
penicillin- treated were dead, and essentially all of the
penicillin+L.callinectes, and L.callinectes -treated were dead (98.7%
and 99.5%, respectively).
Discussion
The embryos of the three invertebrates under
investigation in this study were shown to host a number of Gram
negative, rod-shaped bacteria. The bacteria were seen in dense
coverage over as much as 50% of the surface of Pachygrapsus crassipes
embryos. The bacteria were identified as Pseudomonadacea and
Enterobacteriacea. They did not inhibit growth of Lagenidium
callinectes on agar. Seven of the eight Pachygrapsus crassipes strains
were sensitive to penicillin-G. After treatment with penicillin G,
Pachygrapsus crassipes embryos suffered from colonization by more
protozoa, diatoms, and worms than control embryos receiving no
treatment. Their mortality rate increased dramatically.
The question under scrutiny in this investigation was
whether the bacterial guests of the embryo protect it from unwanted
parasites, or if these bacteria are only parasites themselves. Microbial
protection of embryos has been reported for the shrimp, Palaemon
macrodactylus, which, like Pachygrapsus crassipes, broods its eggs
externally. In that study, however, it was shown that the bacteria
produced an anti-fungal compound, 2,3-indolinedione (Gil-Turnes et.
al, 1989). Similarly, the bacteria found on Homarus americanus
