For this study, the antibiotic-sensitive strains of bacteria
may have been preventing epibiont infestation. Their removal
prompted the explosion of various protozoa and diatoms. The fibrous
masses covering the penicillin G-Lagenidium callinectes-treated
embryos could be a type of fungus, or the egg masses of a predatory
worm. Indeed, evidence of a parasitic nemertean, Carcinonemertes
epialti, has been reported on Pachygrapsus crassipes embryos (Roe,
1979). However, Carcinonemertes epialti is pigmented, unlike the
observed in this study. Its egg masses are as thick in diameter as the
worm itself, also inconsistent with these findings.
It can be hypothesized that symbiont strains were those
sensitive to penicillin G, and their elimination meant an opportunity
for pathogenic strains to exploit the embryo. The fact that penicillin
treated embryos have higher mortalities and retarded development
supports this hypothesis.
In conclusion, while it may be true that the bacteria
themselves stress the developing Pachygrapsus crassipes embryo by
their own oxygen and nutrient requirements, it is likely that they
protect the embryos from more demanding parasites, capable of
harming the embryo to a greater extent.
