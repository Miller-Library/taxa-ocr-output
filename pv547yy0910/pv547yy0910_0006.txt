were made of Nytex mesh, which allowed water to flow through, but
prevented the embryos from escaping. Each beaker was aerated by a
tube connecting to an air filter system. The first cluster received no
treatment. The second cluster received 90mg penicillin G (0.1g/L) for
6 hours on the first day of experimentation, and 6 hours the next. The
third cluster was treated in the same way as the second, and in
addition, was infected with L. callinectes. The fungus had been grown
up on agar, and agar plugs approximately 0.5cm on a side, thick with
fungal hyphae, were placed in the vial containing the embryos. The
beaker holding the fourth cluster was infected with L. callinectes, only.
Results
Observation of DAPI stained embryos
Colony forming rods of several shapes and sizes were
observed by fluorescence microscopy, using oil immersion. The rods
formed long strings or patches. They covered the surface of the egg
itself, and had also colonized the fibers binding the eggs together. The
bacterial cover was not uniform, but patchy. The rod-shaped bacteria
formed small colonies of ten to fifteen cells, and larger colonies of
approximately fifty cells. Rods also formed colonies in long strings.
Identification of Bacterial Isolates
The bacteria that grew on Ã–ZR agar were identified to
family. The tests performed on the strains are presented in Table 1.
Gram-negative, aerobic strains were tentatively placed in
the family Pseudomonadaceae (Table 2). Furthermore, if the colonies
were pigmented yellow or orange, the strain was classified as being in
the flavobacterium or cytophaga genera. If the strain was aerobic and
gram negative, but lacked pigment (white or tan) it was classified as
being in the alteromonas or xanthomonas genera (Hayes, et.al, 1979).
Gram negative facultative anaerobes were tentatively placed in the
Enterobacteriacea family.
