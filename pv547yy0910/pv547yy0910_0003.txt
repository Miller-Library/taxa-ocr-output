suffered greater infestation by fungi, protozoa and diatoms when
bacterial growth was inhibited.
Materials and Methods
Organisms
Ovigerous crabs (Pachygrapsus crassipes and Pagurus
samuelis), and nudibranchs (Hopkinsia rosacea) were collected from
the rocky shore at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA. The
specimens were stored in running sea water aquaria at 15 degrees
Celcius. Äfter several days, the nudibranchs produced an egg ribbon.
Visualization of Bacteria
Use of the DNA specific stain, DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-
phenyl-indole), allowed visualization of bacteria on the invertebrate
embryos. DAPI (1 mg/ml stock solution) was diluted 1 to 1,000 in
ultraviolet filtered sea water (UVSW). The embryos were soaked for
10 minutes in the stain, were rinsed three times in UVSW, and
observed under the fluorescence microscope under oil immersion.
Isolation of Bacteria
Embryos were collected from each species, and bacteria
were isolated. To isolate surface strains from Pachygrapsus crassipes
and Pagurus samuelis, embryos were held with tweezers and dragged
along the surface of "ÖZR" agar (15g DIFCO 2216 marine agar, 1g
tryptone, 1 g yeast extract, 5 mg ferric citrate, 1 L sea water). A second
procedure was used to isolate other strains that might be within the
egg sheath beneath the surface. Embryos were homogenized in sterile
sea water and diluted ten-fold. This second procedure was used for
the H. rosacea eggs, additionally.
In the attempt to isolate strains of each morphological
type, each colony of distinct morphology that appeared on the agar was
chosen for isolation, in the attempt t. Eighteen strains were selected in
