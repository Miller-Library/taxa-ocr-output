assessment. Äfter a ten-fold dilution, the density of colonies from the
penicillin G-soaked embryos was 7.1x10° colony forming units
(cfu)/ug, compared to 3.8x104 cfu/ug for the control (Table 3). The
penicillin+L. callinectes treatment resulted in 4.6x10° cfu/ug, and the
L. callinectes treatment showed 1.2x10° cfu/ug (Table 4).
Embryos were examined for development, mortality, and
number of epibionts 10, 13, and 18 days after the experimental setup
(corresponding to days 15, 18, and 23 of embryo development, since
embryos were taken from their mother approximately 5 days into
development). In the assessments on days 10 and 13, only 10-20
embryos per treatment comprised the sample. On day 18, all
remaining embryos were examined (100-300 embryos per treatment).
Epibionts
While fungal hyphae were not observed on the
penicillin G or penicillin G+L.callinectes-treated embryos 18 days after
the initial penicillin soaking, many other epibionts appeared heavily
on the penicillin G-treated egg surfaces. By 10 and 13 days into the
treatment, diatom and protozoan activity was high on the eggs
receiving penicillin G. Eighteen days after the start of the treatments,
the eggs were thickly covered with masses of fibers, made up of
smaller, round bodies. This could be an egg mass or a fungus
(apparently not Lagenidium callinectes).
Several transparent worms crawled the surface of the
embryos receiving the L.callinectes -treatment. Besides this change,
the surfaces of eggs in the control treatment and the L.callinectes
-treatment remained as clean at 18 days into the treatment as they had
been at the start of the experiment. They hosted only a few protozoa.
Mortality
Discoloration indicated a dead embryo. In dead embryos,
either the cells were orange, or the extracellular fluid was pink. In the
first assessment, 10 days after the start of the experiment, 50% of the
sample of embryos taken from the control group were dead. None of
