Abstract
Bacteria were observed on the embryos of Pachygrapsus
crassipes, Pagurus samuelis, and Hopkinsia rosacea. Strains that grew
in culture were isolated, and were identified as Pseudomonadaceae
and Enterobacteriaceae. There were eighteen isolates: eight from
Pachygrapsus crassipes, six from Pagurus samuelis, and four from
Hopkinsia rosacea. None of the strains showed anti-fungal activity
against Lagenidium callinectes. The role of the bacteria isolated from
Pachygrapsus crassipes embryos were studied in greater detail.
Embryos treated with penicillin G, which was effective against seven
of the eight strains of bacteria, had a higher mortality rate, and a
greater likelihood of being infested with other microbes. This finding
suggests a defense role for the bacteria.
