total: eight strains were chosen from the Pachygrapsus crassipes
embryos, strains 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 19, and 20, six from the Pagurus
samuelis, strains 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and four from H. rosacea,
strains 15, 16, 17, and 18. Pure cultures were obtained after two to
three streakings.
Bacteria Identification
Colony characteristics on ÖZR agar were noted with
respect to color, edge continuity, and general texture. Gram staining
was performed on each isolate. Live cells were examined for motility.
The strains were defined as strict aerobes or facultative
anaerobes based upon their growth being strictly on the agar surface or
additionally, beneath the agar at a depth of greater than 2 cm.
Fermentation of glucose was ascertained by a pH change. The strains
were grown up in a medium containing a pH indicator; acid
production caused a color change.
Strains were tested for the presence of catalase, an
enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of peroxides formed in the cell
during respiratory metabolism, and for the presence of cytochrome C
(oxidase test). A result of the cell's breakdown of tryptophan is indole
accumulation. This property was recorded, also.
The methyl red test was done to detect the compound
acetoin, indicative of a distinct fermentation pathway leading to the
product 2,3-butanediol, in which acetoin is the immediate precursor to
butanediol. Cells were examined for H»S production, and nitrate
reduction, additionally. The results of all these tests are presented in
Table 1.
Testing for Anti-Fungal Properties Among Isolates
A competition experiment was established to ascertain
whether Lagenidium callinectes growth was inhibited by the various
bacterial species, L. callinectes was grown on ÖZR agar, and a plug
removed and transferred to a fresh plate of ÖZR agar. Hyphae grew
out from the plug after several days, at which point, each of the
