The activity pattern of the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1851)

at Pacific Grove, California, is the subject of this article. Field studies were
carried out to follow the locomotory and feeding activities of individuals of
T. funebralis to determine how much of each animal's time was spent in each of
these activities, and when and under what environmental conditions they occurred.
Field observations of Tegula funebralis in this study were carried out in the
tide pools on the N.E. side of lussel Point at Pacific Grove, California. The
intertidal substrate herd is composed of granite cutcroppings and boulders;
depressions are filled with coarse sand and shell fragments. The vegetation is
primarily Gigartina (Agardhii and leptorhynchos), Peyssonnelia, Ralfsia, and a thin
green algal film. Any heavy surf is broken up before it reaches this area by an
offshore granite reef. Inshore ocean temperatures varied from aboût 11 to 14°0
during the period of observation, 25 April to 1 June, 1963.
Four individual Tegula funebralis were chosen to followy in detail. Their sizes
are given below.
