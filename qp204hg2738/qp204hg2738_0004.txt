were found on the tops of rocks, and the single individual whe remained on a vertical
surface was well protedted by Gigartina. However, many snails start to climb
vertical rock faces as soon as the incoming tide submerges them. They follow the water
level,and hence tend to cluster on the tops of rocks submerged at high tide,and in
belts around the sides of rocks not wholly submerged at hégh tide. This tendency
to climb with the tide is borne out by the increasing percentage of time spent on

vertical and horizontal rock surfaces at times when therare submerged. They then

This(Characteristic)massing of Tegula funebralis on submerged horizontal surfaces
is less(tæ during the day than at night, however. Fig. 3 shows the results of an
experiment, conducted in a cloudy day, in a greenhouse aquarium. This aquarium was

(3 large, 2 medium, and 3 small and 3 minute) were individually marked and placed
in the aquarium. Observations were made at half hour intervals and displacement ut

the field noted. Each bar represents the sum of the number of times animals were o
observed to have moved upward and downward in a 2 hour period. There appears to
be a correlation between time of day and the upward vs. downward movements of
T. funebralis. The figure indicates a slight but definite downward activity about
