sunrise and a corresponding upward activity about sunset. This situation is
nobce
borne out by observations in the field where one can observe large numbers of
the animals on the submerged horizontal surfaces at night but fewer during the
day.
On the sample field record (fig. 1) it is apparent that feeding took place
only when the animals were wet. These and all other field observations on
feeding are shown graphically in Fig. 4, which records the percentage of each
animal's total feeding time which was spent under each degree of immersion.
Most of the time when the animals are feeding they aressubmerged. About one
third of feeding activity occurs while the animals are awash. Feeding activity
out of water onlu occurs immediately following the awash state and is negligible.

In general, in the low tide situations typical for the individuals followede

no activity/was present. In contrast, during much of the time the animals
were submerged or amash, they were either moving or feeding or both. There is
an important exception to the above generalizations, however. This occurs
in the special case of the high spring tide. Fig. 5 shows field observations
nade during two spring tides, both over 5 feet. In each case feeding and other
activity ceased during the peak of the tide. The only locomotion shown occurred
when the snail was washed loose and forced to move to regain the rock.
