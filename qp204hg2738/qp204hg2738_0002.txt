figure made from reflector tape to the shell and (b) by cementing a wire eyelet
to the shell and attaching a 10 cm length of brightly colored thread to this, making
the animal visible even though buried among algae, rocks, or other snails. These
animals were replaced in the same tide pool area from which they had been collected
be
at approzimately 3 feet above mean lower low water, and observed for periods at
frequent intervals.
In organizing the notes taken from these observations, a system for graphing

the information was developed so that important relationships could be more readily
seen. Fig. 1, which covers a complete tidal cycle, is representative of my findings.
It represents a systematic diary of the activities of the animals which could be
followed, and of some of the environmental conditions. Data are recorded as follows.

(Ã ) The exact times of actual observation, are shown by a black line at the top of
Fig. 1.
(b) Meteorological conditions and surf indicate the approximate conditions of sky and
sea during the period of the observation.

(c) The symbols for locomotion indicate occurence of this activity. When at the
beginning of a peroid of observation a given animal occupied a different position
than that noted at the end of the previous observation, locomotion was indicated as
present but not observed.
(d) Feeding activity is also indicated in Fig. 1. It was never easy to det
