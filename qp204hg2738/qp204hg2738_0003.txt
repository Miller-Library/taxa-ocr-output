exactly when the animals were feeding and when they were not. Preliminary studies
of animals in laboratory aquaria revealed several different techniques for determining
presence or absence of radular motion and these were used as indications of feeding

in the field. When ebserving Tegula funebralis from above, the mouth area fan-be-

a profile of the mouth area is exposed, the movements of the buccal mass produce a
indentation anteriorly on the head at each stroke. Where conditions did not permit
observing the above actions I sometimes had to depend on the rhythmic halting locoÂ¬
motion or rhythmic motion of the shell characteristic of a feeding animal, of on
rhythmic motion of an algal substrate as an indication.
(e) The position symbols show the relative position of the snail on the rock substrate.
(f) The degree of immersion symbols show whether the smail was continuously
submerged, awash, or out of water entirely.
(g) Height of tide is a graphis representation of the tidal curve, based on tide table
predictions and application of the one-quarter-one-tenth rule.

One of the first relationships noted was the lafge numbers of animals on submerged
horizontal rock surfaces at high tide. Fig. 2 shows the behavior of three individuals,
indicating their positions onhroeks under various conditions. When out of water
they tend to occupy such sheltered spots as under rocks and in crevids, which Mad
offer some protection from dessication. As shown in Fig. 2, no animals out of water
