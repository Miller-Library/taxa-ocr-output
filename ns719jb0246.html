Doty (1946) correlates intertidal zonation with
critical exposure time and suggests that an organism's
upper limit is determined primarily by its ability to with-
stand the stresses which such exposure imposes; the more
resistant an organism is to temperature and salinity varia-
tion, dessication, and other factors resulting from exposure,
the higher it can exist in the intertidal. Many species
of barnacle inhabit the upper intertidal zones and consequent-
ly might be expected to be resistant to these same stresses.
Since barnacles are poikiotherms, it is reasonable
to suspect that their body temperature would closely follow
the temperature of their substrate. Indeed,Suzuki and Mori
(1963) reported that the shell surface and the body tempera-
ture of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tetraclita squamosa japonica : Exact'>Tetraclita squamosa japonica</span> remained the same, but
this temperature was always slightly lower than that of the
barnacle's substrate because of the cooling effect of evapo¬
ration of mantle cavity and body water. This evaporation
would be expected to increase the salinity of the mantle
cavity fluid.
It appears then that under normal conditions of
exposure high intertidal barnacles would be subjected to
salinity extremes due to (1) fresh water from precipitation
and consequent runoff and (2) high mantle cavity salinity
due to evaporation resulting from high midday temperatures.
It is, therefore, expected that these organisms might show
adaptations to extreme salinities.
This expectation has been in part confirmed by
Borusk and Kreps (1929), who showed that <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. balanoides</span> (L)
and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. crenatus</span> Brug. can exist for three weeks in fresh
water in a state of 'salt sleep', a state in which all cirral
activity ceases, the opercular plates are closed, and res¬
piration is maintained at a low level. Furthermore, Barnes
and Barnes (1958) reported that B. balanoides feeds normally
in 60% to 90% sea water, opens but does not feed in 50% sea
water, but closes in salinities of 25% or less. Barnes (1953)
has shown that the nauplii of the same species remain healthy
and active within a range of from 18'oto 300 (approx. 50% to
90% sea water). However, they cease movement in 6 %0 (approx.
20% sea water), and die in one hour in 3%0 (approx. 10% sea water).
Barnes and Barnes observed that B. balanoides exhibited a beha-
vioral response to exposure by extruding the mantle cavity water.
However, they did not consider the question of tolerance to high
salinity as important.
The present study is an investigation of the effect
of salinity on the adult and early-stage embryo of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus glandula : Exact'>Balanus glan-
dula</span> Darwin (1854). This species occurs intertidally from about
mean high high water (approx. + 10 feet) to the lowest high low
water (approx. + 1 foot), thus spanning several intertidal zones.
Since <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. glandula</span> is found up to + 10 feet, it would be expected
to have a high tolerance to the temperature and salinity extremes
which might occur during its normally long periods of exposure
(up to two days).
The results of this study indicate that Balanus glan-
dula exhibits a remarkable tolerance to salinity extremes. The
adult barnacles are able to withstand exposure to salinities of
0%6 to 300% sea water, while the developing embryos show somewhat
less tolerance, dying when subjected to salinity below 50% sea
water or above 200% sea water. Field observations suggested
the normal occurence of increased mantle cavity salinities under
natural conditions of exposure. No behavioral adaptations as
noted by Barnes and Barnes were observed.
Temperature
To determine whether the temperature of the mantle
cavity of B. glandula followed that of its substrate, a popula-
tion attached to granite rock approximately eight feet above
mean lower low water was monitored for temperature changes in
the following manner. A hole was carefully made in the side
of large specimens from the uppermost limits of the population
and a Yellow Springs Tele-thermometer (Model 43 TD) small ani-
mal microprobe inserted so that the probe entered the mantle
cavity under the body. The hole was sealed with wax, effectively
enclosing the probe inside the mantle cavity. At the same time,
a small surface probe was taped to the shell adjacent to the
microprobe and an air temperature probe attached so that it was
at least a centimeter above the rock surface. The three probes
were connected to a switch box which in turn was plugged into
the Tele-thermometer. The temperature was monitored every five
minutes for periods of 2 to 8 hours during both day and-night.
The results, illustrated in figure 1, show that the
mantle cavity temperature follows the shell surface temperature
rather closely. The two temperatures remained within 5 degrees
C. of each other and ranged between 8.9°0. and 38°0.; note that
on May 3 and May 4 the barnacle temperature was somewhat higher
than the surface temperature; however, since it was difficult
to get the surface probe flush with the shell, the strong wind
which occurred on these days could well have influenced these
results by cooling the area adjacent to the shell so that the
surface probe was actually recording the air temperature. In
conditions of extreme exposure during midday in the summer or
at night during the winter, the barnacles could well experience
even harsher conditions.
To check the field data, a similar test was run under
laboratory conditions where ambient temperatures could be con¬
trolled and extended beyond those encountered in the field. In
this as well as all following experiments involving adult barna-
tilus
cles only animals attached to the shells of the mussel My
californianus were used so that the basal plates remained intact
and the animals would not be subjected to injury. The same pro-
cedure was used as in the field experiments except that tempera-
ture changes were induced by immersing the animals in 9°0. sea
water, 14"C. sea water or by exposure to room temperature or the
heat from a 60 watt bulb.
Figure 2 shows the results of this experiment. Again,
the barnacle's temperature followed the shell surface temperature,
although the internal temperatures tended to lag slightly behind
those at the shell surface. Nevertheless, the barnacle's tempera¬
ture changed quickly, in one case falling 14.2'0. in five minutes.
Exposure to high temperature might be expected to raise
the salinity of the mantle cavity fluid, as suggested by Suzuki
and Mori (1963). To test this possibility the mantle cavity fluid
was removed by inserting a syringe through a hole made in the shell
and the salinity determined with a refractometer (A0, 0-30 C.)
before and after 16 hours exposure to the heat generated by a
60 watt bulb. Initial mantle salinities were 47Zwhile the final
reading was 51.7%. This increase suggests that higher salini-
ties would be produced under harsher conditions. Thus the bar-
nacles might be subjected to high mantle cavity salinities during
periods of midday exposure, suggesting wide salinity tolerance
limits for both adults and embryos.
Adult Tolerance Limits
Specimens of Balanus glandula which were attached to
mussels were cleaned, other species of barnacles removed, and
the excess mussel shell broken away. The specimens were placed
in a pan of sea water to induce cirral activity; the shells were
numbered and the number of active and inactive barnacles noted.
Barnacles not showing activity were considered to be dead and
were not included in the subsequent experiments. At least fifty
"active" barnacles were utilized for each experiment. These
were placed in a refrigerator pan containing well-aerated water
of the desired salinity. Salinities were determined with an
AO refractometer and a Gemware hydrometer. A standard curve was
made for the refractometer by taking readings of 50%, 100%, and
200% sea water and adjusting these to the reading of a sample
of "Normal water". The hydrometer readings were converted by
means of standard tables. The pans were covered to prevent evapo-
ration and aerators inserted through holes in the cover to pro-
vide continuous aeration. These pans were floated in refrigera-
ted sea water, keeping the solutions at a constant temperature
of 9° to 10°0. At intervals of 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours, ten
5.
barnacles were removed from each of the test solutions and placed
in aerated sea water (13°to 16°0.) for two days. The barnacles
were then removed from the shells and placed under a dissecting
scope. They were considered to be alive if they reacted to the
light or to a prod with a dissecting needle.
Figure 3 indicates the results of these experiments
and shows that the adults can withstand exposure to salinities
ranging from 0% to 300% sea water. The one animal which died
in the 125% sea water solution was not considered to be signi-
ficant since there were no observed mortalities in solutions of
90% or 150% sea water.
Embryo Tolerance Limits
The two ovigerous lamellae were removed from each mature
adult, one was cut in half and the other left intact. The length
of the clear outside covering of the embryo and the length of
the embryo itself were measured with an ocular micrometer under
a compound microscope. The lamellae were then placed in aerated
beakers containing water of various salinities. The beakers
were floated in refrigerated sea water at a temperature of 9 to
10 degrees C. The lamellae were removed after 1, 4, 24, 48,
and 72 hours and measured as before and the percent of lysed or
crenated eggs noted.
Unlike the adults, the embryos appear to be sensitive
to salinities below 50% and above 200%, as is shown in figure
4. Since the results for the intact and the cut lamellae are
essentially the same, it is evident that the elastic sac surroun¬
the lamella provides no protection to the eggs. Also the eggs
never behaved as osmometers; essentially they either resisted the
osmotic stress with no apparant volume change or they lysed.
Salinity of the Mantle Cavity Fluid
Since the adult can withstand distilled water, it seems
probable that the animal may be excluding water by closing the
opercular plates. The opercular plates remain open in fifty
percent sea water, but there is no feeding; in 25% sea water
the opercular plates close tightly. To investigate the efficacy
of this behavior in excluding the ambient salinity, the
mantle cavity fluid of B. glandula was sampled in the following
manner. A hole was made in the shell and the mantle cavity fluid
removed with a small syringe. The mantle cavity fluid from seve-
ral barnacles was pooled so that there was enough fluid to use
in the refractometer. The animals were placed in aerated beakers
containing water of various salinities and these were floated
in refrigerated sea water maintained at 8°to 10°0. After 1,
A. 24, 48, and 72 hours, the salinities of the mantle cavity
and of the test solution were determined.
In 10% to 50% sea water, where the opercular plates
were closed, the mantle cavity fluid remained significantly more
saline than the test solution. In 125% to 200% sea water, where
the barnacles were actively feeding, the mantle cavity salinity
rose to that of the test solution. The method utilized is not
precise since it is impossible to avoid getting blood and small
amounts of eggs and tissue in the sample; likewise, the presence
of excretory products might increase the refractive index of the
fluid. This could account for the variability in the salinity
readings. Notwithstanding, the mantle cavity salinity and the
external salinity were different enough in the lower salt solu-
tions to strongly suggest that the barnacles were able to exclude
surrounding water by closing their opercular plates.
Discussion
Both field and laboratory experiments tend to substan-
tiate the close correlation of ambient temperature and barnacle
mantle cavity temperature. Since water remains in the mantle
cavity, even after two days of dessication, a hot day could con-
cievably raise the salinity of this fluid significantly. B. glan-
dula seems to have the capacity to withstand very high salini-
ties: the adults can survive in 300% sea water, while the embryos
can withstand up to 200% sea water. In the embryos, the sac
surrounding the ovigerous lamellae does not appear to provide
protection since there is no volume change or difference in the
rate of lysing between intact and cut lamellae. It is suggested
that the presence of the clear outside covering of the embryo
is the most likely means of protection. The mechanism by which
adults endure these high salinities is not known. However, the
properties of the animal's exoskeleton might be involved in main-
taining this high tolerance.
The embryos are less tolerant to low salinities; how-
ever, it seems that they would never be subjected to salinities
of less than 50% sea water, for the adult barnacles close their
opercular plates at salinities lower than this, completely sealing
themselves from the environment by this means.
High salinities, on the other hand, may be unavoida-
ble when the organisms are subjected to high temperatures. Eva¬
poration of the shell water and the consequent transfer of man-
tle cavity water to the shell as well as direct evaporation from
the mantle cavity might occur even though the opercular plates
were closed. It is not surprising, therefore, that B. glandula
has adapted to high salinities by some mechanism other than oper-
cular closure.
The adult and brooded embryos of Balanus glandula can
withstand the salinities normally imposed by exposure in the in-
tertidal. Their distribution would not be limited by salinity
unless the extreme conditions were so persistant as to cause
starvation, an excessive accumulation of waste products, or in-
hibition of larval settlement and development. The high tolerance
of B. glandula to salinity is one factor enabling it to inhabit
the highest intertidal zone.
Summary
1. The mantle cavity temperature of Balanus glandula closely
follows its shell surface temperature.
Adults can withstand from 0% to 300% sea water; they exclude the
lower salinities by closing the opercular plates, effectively
sealing themselves off from the surrounding water.
Embryos can tolerate from 50% to 200% sea water.
Salinity does not appear to be a limiting factor in the dis-
tribution of Balanus glandula.
