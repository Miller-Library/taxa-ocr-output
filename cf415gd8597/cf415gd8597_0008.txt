low water on May 8 from the sheltered cove on the Boatworks
Beach.
The results are shown in Fig. 5. The difference between
average numbers of animals above the sand in light and dark
periods is significant at the 99.998 level for the entrainment
period, although there is no obvious consistent anticipation
of the light or dark periods. A continuation of oscillations
in activity corresponding to the zeitgeber (Aschoff, 1965) is
apparent, although the differences between number
s above sand
during the day and at night is not significant.
Additional experiments with numbered individuals showed
fairly regular circadian rhythms in several individuals.
However, these data were not complete enough to offer an
entirely accurate picture of an individual's activity.
Aquaria experiments with a simulated tide were set up as
well. Data suggests a response to low water levels but,
due to insufficient controls and a presence of too many envir-
onmental variables, results for these experiments were somewhat
irregular.
Mating Behavior
In attempt to determine whether the number of mating pairs
was greater under conditions of light or conditions of dark-
ness, control data for the constant darkness experiment
(Fig. 4, top) were analyzed. Mean values of pooled data for
numbers of mating snails in total light and total dark periods
were compared using the Yates correction for Xe. The dif-
ference in numbers of mating pairs at night and during the day
