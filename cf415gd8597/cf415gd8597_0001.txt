The burrowing snail, Olivella biplicata (Sowerby, 1825),
inhabits the intertidal and adjacent subtidal zones on sandy
shores along the wastern coast of North America. Edwards (1969)
noted that the animals tend to burrow under the sand surface
when exposed to light, and, in experiments with light gradients,
found that larger snails tend to cluster at lower light levels
than smaller snails. David Phillips of Hopkins Marine Station
had also observed that Olivella tend to be out on the sand
surface at night and burrowed below it during the day, and
suggested that a biological clock might be involved (pers.
comm., 1972). The present study has been undertaken to further
investigate this response to light and to examine the possibility
of circadian
rhythms in Olivella biplicata. All
studies were carried out in the period April - June, 1972, on
populations available at low tide at the south end of Monterey
Bay, California.
