FTELD STUDIES
An initial field study was carried out to see whether
more snails were on the sand surface at night than during the
day. Observations were made on consecutive days at low tide
in three areas: 1) the exposed portion of the beach (Boatworks
Beach) between Mussel Point and Point Alones, Pacific Grove,
2) a sheltered sandy cove on this same beach, and 3) the beach
just east of Fishermans Wharf (Wharf #1), Monterey. The
populations observed were always those covered by approximately
one foot of water at the time of observation. At each
sampling period, a 0.25me sheet metal quadrat frame was
pushed into the sand in two different places in each area,
and the numbers of animals above and below the sand within the
frame were recorded. Illumination during night studies was
provided by a five-battery flashlight shielded by two layers
of red cellophane.
The results are shown in Figure 1. The snails found
ranged from 1.5 to 3.Ocm in shell length. At least 50% of the
observed populations were below the surface at any one time.
Almost the only individuals found above the sand surface in
direct light were mating pairs, suggesting that the stimulus
of mating may supercede the stimulus to light. Excluding
mating pairs, data from three daytime readings (April 22, 23,
and 24) and three nightime readings (April 24, 26, and 27) were

pooled and averaged; the dillerence between mean percentages
of animals above the surface at night and during the day was
significant at the 998 level. The small samples found at
