DISCUSSION
The erratic burrowing behavior of Olivella biplicata and
lack of equipment permitting continuoys monitoring of activity
make the investigation of the existence of a circadian rhythm

in this organism diiricult. In spite of these factors, both
field studies and experimental results indicate a definite
light:dark periodicity in the activity of Olivella biplicata.
Retainment of these oscillationsunder conditions of constant
darkness, after being subjected to a light: dark regime, sug-
gest the presence of a circadian rhythm.
The existence of an endogenous biological clock in Oli
vella biplicata, as well as in other intertidal organisms,
could be of considerable ecological importance as suggested
by J.T. Enright (1970). Although environmental stimuli re-
present the dominant determinants of most behavior, an endogen-
ous rhythmic pattern could
provide the organism with
a temporary inertia in times of environmental dis
ruptance.
the selective advantage of this behavior can be inferred, al-
though the behavior of this particular organism appear
s to be
tremely complex.
