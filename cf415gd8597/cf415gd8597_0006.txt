this experiment be repeated, I suggest using a shallower layer
of sand on the bottom, and perhaps providing each snail with
a trailing marker which would project above the sand,
Experiments with circadian rhythms:
The presence of a fairly consistent rhythm of activity
with respect to light and dark suggests the possibility of a
biological clock. Several experiments were set up to test for
the presence of a circadian rhythm and to attempt entrainment
by an artificial light-dark cycle.
Constant darkness
Two sea water tanks, both provided with approximately
three inches of sand from the area of sample collection and

with continuous flows of fresh sea water, were set up in a
darkroom with alternating periods of light and darkness. The
light period for both tanks corresponded approximately to that
of a normal day, with lights on at 0800 and off at 2000 hrs.
Each tank received 70 Olivella, collected at lower low water
on April 30 from the protected sandy cove on the Boatworks
Beach. After 6 days, one tank continued as a control, with
alternating 12 hr periods of light and dark, while the other
was left in constant darkness. Observations were continued for
another 6 days. During the entire 12 day period tanks were
observed at intervals, both day and night, and at each observation
the number of animals at the surface (both mating and single
animals) was recorded.
The results are shown in Fig. 4. For the first 6 days,
both tanks show clear daily cycles of activity correlated with
