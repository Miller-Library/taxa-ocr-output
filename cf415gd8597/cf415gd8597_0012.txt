Figure 1: Light; dark activity of Olivella biplicata at low
tide on sandy beaches. Surf conditions and day:night cycle
are illustrated
raphically. Black bars represent the number
of individuals above the sand and white bars are mating pairs,
Time and tidal height at each observation are indicated.
Figure 2: Day:night activity of 1000 Olivella on a simulated
outdoor beach. Day and night are indicated graphically, with
cross hatch being dusk or overcast conditions. Black bars
represent numbers of snails on the sand surface.
Figure 3: Comparison of locomotor activity of Olivella in
light and dark. Top: illustration of tank labyrinth used in
the experiment. Bottom: Time after introduction of 25 snails
to Box 1 is shown horizontally. The solid line represents the
total number of snails above the sand surface at times of ob-
servation. Dashed line is the number of snails in Box 1
when observed. The numbers of animals in Boxes 2, 3, and 4
are represented by vertical bars (Box 2- black, Box 3- white,
Box 4- cross hatched.
Figure 4: Test for a Circadian rhythm in Olivella biplicata.
Time and light:dark periods are indicated horizontally. In-
dividuals above are indicated by black bars; mating pairs are
represented by white bars. Top: control (alternating 12
hour periods of light dark), bottom: experimental tank
