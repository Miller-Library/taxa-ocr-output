Locomotor activity in light and darkne
The larger numbers of animals above the sand surface at
night suggests greater, or at least more wide-ranging, locomotor
activity during darkness. To see whether this was the case, a
comparative study of displacement under conditions of light and
dark was made. Fifty individuals were collected at lower low
water on May 8 at the sheltered cove of the Boatworks Beach.
These were divided between two aquaria, one with constant
flourescent illumination, the other kept in darkness. Each
tank was covered on the bottom with sand to a depth of three
inches, and was partitioned into a labyrinth of four compartments
or boxes, incompletely separated by vertical sheets of glass
(Fig. 3, top). All animals were initially placed in Box 1 of
each tank, and their subsequent positions were checked at
intervals over the next three hours. In the lighted tanks,
animals could be detected by the positions of their siphons
above the sand, In the dark tanks it was necessary to locate
the burrowed animals by "feel".
The results indicate clearly that displacement with time
was greater in the dark tanks than in those in the light. The
number of animals remaining in Box 1 after 3.5 hrs was significantly
greater (958 level) in light than in the dark. The experiment
suggests that, in darkness, not only are more snails found on
the sand surface, but their locomotor activity is greater.
There is some possibility that "feeling" in the dark tanks
stimulated these animals to greater movement, and that the
greater displacement here might be due in part to this. Should
