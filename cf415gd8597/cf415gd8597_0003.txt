Additional observations were made on a population of 1000
Olivella biplicata, 1.5 to 3.Ocm in shell length, taken on May 2
from Monterey Harbor and maintained on a simulated beach composed
of two tons of sand in an outdoor tank, 15.5 x 9.5 x 2ft. at
Hopkins Marine Station. This beach had a slope of approximately
8' and the tank received a constant flow of fresh sea water.
Low tide was simulated by slowly draining and refilling the tank
every day between 0800 and 1400hrs; at low tide (1100 hrs.) the
tire beach was uncovered. The daylight low tide was unfortunate,
since it introduced another environmental variable during daylight,
but was unavoidable since the tank was also in use by other
investigators. Observations began one week after introduction
of Olivella to the tank, and were continued at varying intervals
over a six day period.
The results of this study are displayed in Fig. 2. The
difference between the number of animals at the surface during
daylight (0600 - 2000 inclusive) and those up at night, pooling
data for the whole period, is statistically significant at the
99% level. However, this includes the combined effects of
light and low tide during the day vs high tide and darkness at
night. By excluding all daylight observations taken after
0800 and before 1400, day vs night high tide conditions can be
compared. "Using these data, the difference between the average
mber of animals up during the day vs those up at night is
still significant at the 99% level. There seemed to be differences
