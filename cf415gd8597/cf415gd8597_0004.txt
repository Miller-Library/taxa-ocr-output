in activity between sunny periods and periods of fog or dusk
on May 9(0800 and 1600), May 10( 1800 and 1600), and May 16
(0800 and 1200). These suggest the orthokenetic light response
postulated by Edwards (1969). Were this experiment to be
repeated, more useful data could be obtained by a) elimination
of tidal vatiations, and b) setting observation times at
critical periods, eg. noon, midnight, and one hour before and
after sunrise and sunset.

LABORATORY STUDIES
In order to quantify the effects of light on activity of
Olivella biplicata and to determine the existence of a biological
clock, several laboratory experiments were undertaken. In all
experiments, animals were kept in 17.5 x 10.5 x 10 in. aquaria,
supplied with fresh running seawater at about 1'C above ambient
sea temperature. Simulated daylight was provided by four
General Electric flourescent lights (F48712 Cool White, High
Output), suspended 16 inches above the aquaria. Animals were
xamined periodically; readings in darkness were made in red
T7
light using a Starlite Illuminator with link and variable
transformer (A0 - model 865, 115 VAC, 60 cycles, 2.75 amps)
set at 5.5v, using a G.E. (1480) bulb screened by a Corning
filter, number 243(minimum transmission at 610 nm, midpoint
at 630 nm, peak at 660 nm). This light source was shown in
preliminary tests to have no effect on the activity of the
subjects. All animals used were 1.5 to 3.Ocm in shell length.
