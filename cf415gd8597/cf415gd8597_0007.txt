differs significantly (98% level, using the Yates correction
for X and excluding mating pairs). The dark period, in this
and subsequent analyses, was considered to include observations
from 2100 to 0800 hrs and the light period from 0900 to 2000 hrs.
since readings at 0800 and 2000 hrs were made just as the lights
went on or off. There is some evidence that the animals
anticipate the dark period; comparison of average numbers of
animals above the sand at 1200 and 2000 hrs during the entraining
period was significant at the 97.58 level. For the animals in
lank 2; during the period of continual darkness, the graphs in
Tig. 4 reveal a fairly clear retention of day-night oscillations
in activity, coinciding with those of the controls. However.
a greater number of animals are at the surface 0900 - 2000 hrs
than in the control, and day-night differences between the
numbers of animals above the surface at day and those on the
surface in the preceeding night, are significant at the 958
level only for May 15 and 17.
