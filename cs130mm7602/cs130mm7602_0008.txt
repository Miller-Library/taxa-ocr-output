tentative.
Velocities above were calculated for the traces in figure 7B only,
The distance from stimulus to recording site was not measured for the
experiment in figure 7A, making calculationsof velocities impossible.
However, by inspection, one can see that tactile and tube foot stimuli
evoke action potentials with nearly the same velocity in this case.
Cat Free Experiments - Persistance of Fast Electrical Activity Following
Tube Foot Stimulation
In light of the possible role of involvement of the "giant" class
1 axons in tube foot stimulation results, several experiments were car¬
ried out using a Car free medium. Activity of class 1 axons is not
abolished by Ca" removal, whereas that of slower axons, and chemical
synapsis is. (Brehm,1977; Tuft & Gilly, 1984; Yee,1984)
My first Ca' free experiment was a behavioral one. One of the
legs of a large Ophiuroid was placed in a dish of Car free sea water,
The rest of the animal was in a seperate dish of normal sea water. Once
the anesthetized leg had stopped spontaneous movement, It was stimulated
with a tube foot, There was no reaction. The other legs, when individ¬
ually stimulated, caused the whole animal (except the anesthetized leg)
to react by moving violently.
Next, I set up an isolation chamber experiment for electrical re¬
cording as pictured in figure 1, The dissection had two ganglia exposed
distal to the recording site, and the isolation chamber was filled with
Ca“t free sea water. In figure 84, traces 1 - 3 show recordings of
electrical activity following a tube foot stimulation taken prior to
application of Catt free sea water. Trace 4 is a control. Traces 5 -
9 show stimulated recordings made at the times indicated following the
change to Ca free sea water. Traces 10 and 11 were taken after the
