As one can see, the variability in conduction velocity is much larger
for the tube foot stimulus than for electrical shocks, However, on the
average, itis very fast, and nearly the same as for electrical stimulas
tion. The most rapidly propagating activity due to electrical stimula¬
tion of Ophiopteris nerve has been reported to be about 1.40 m/sec at
19°0 (Tuft & Gilly, 1984) and 0,5 m/sec at 14°C. These authors identify
this activity with large class 1 axons. The conduction velocity given
above for tube foot (0.5 m/sec) and electrical (0.42 m/sec) stimulation
at 13 - 15°0,suggest that class 1 axons underly activity recorded in my
experiments due to both modes of stimulation,
East R.N.C. Electrical Activity Due To Needle Vs, Tube Foot Stimulation
Yigure 7 shows results of two experiments testing the difference
between fast nervous activity generated by a purely tactile (syringe
needle) stimulus and by a stimulus using Pycnopodia tube foot. In figure
7A the top trace shows the result from a stimulus using a syringe needle,
The next trace shows a control experiment in which the tube foot stim¬
ulator was set to hit the water close to,but not on the leg of the
Ophiopteris. The third trace shows the result of tube foot stimulation;
the recorded activity is similar to that seen with needle stimulation,
From the bottom experiment, (fig. 7B) one finds the conduction velocity
of the tube foot stimulation to be 0.41 m/sec. The conduction velocity
of both needle stimuli is 0.33 m/sec. These conduction velocities were
calculated using a 17 mm distance from stimulation to recording site.
This could have varied by as much as + 3 mm due to difficulty in stim¬
ulating the leg tip in exactly the same place from trial to trial.
Although the conduction velocity for the tactile stimulation seems to
be slower than that for tube foot stimulation, this must be regarded as
