Figure 1. Experimental set up for recording from isolated portions
of the ophiuroid leg which can placed in Ca+ free sea water,
Figure 2. Initial escape response following stimulation by tube
foot.
Figure 3. Leg jerk behavior
Figure 4. Behavioral latency of leg jerk, The line on the graph
was fit by eye.
Figure 5. Tube foot vs, electrical stimulation, The experiment was
done at 13 - 15°C, the electrical stimulus was a 30V 0.5 msec shock,
The electrical traces have a 7amsec delay, while the t 'foot traces
have an 8 msec delay imposed nearly entirely by inertia of the relay,
Figure 6. Chemical stimulation using Pycnopodia homogenate.
Figure 7. Needle va, Tube foot stimulation, Two experiments are
represented. In each case, activity was recorded from a single site,
Temperature was 13 - 15°c.
Figure 8. Ca+t free results. The Ca+ free medium had a ph of 7.78,
and osmolarity of 981.
