Introduction
The ophiuroid Ophiopteris papillosa is a natural for neuroethological
studies. Ophiopteris is an extremely mobile ophiuroid which exhibits a
variety of interesting behavior. The R.N.C. is fairly easy to dissect
and animals are easily maintained,
The greatest problem encountered in the study of ophiuroid nervous
systems is the size of the nervous units. Brehm(1977), and Cobb & Stubbs
(1981) have found axons up to 10 - 20 u in diameter. These are much larg¬
er than most echinoderm axons, yet they are still quite small, Therefore,
extracellular suction electrodes have been used to record neryous actiy¬
ity, and analysis of activity in single neurons has not yet been possible
Work by Tuft & Gilly (1984) and Yee (1984) has shown that some of these
"giant" axons are Ca independant, rapidly conducting axons, Tuft &
Gilly refered to these axons as "class 1" axons, and showed them to have
a conduction velocity of 1.40'm/sec at 19°c. Yee found a velocity of
0,5 m/sec at 14°c.
This paper concerns the general integratory mechanisms under¬
lying an escape response in Ophiopteris. This escape response is exhib¬
ited when the ophiuroid is stimulated by the touch of Pycnopodia.
Methods
Extracellular recording methods were employed for the neurophysio-
logical part of this study. This was done with glass suction electrodes
drawn to a tip diameter of about 0,2 mm. These glass electrode tips
were fitted to the end of a syringe. One of the Ag:AgCl electrode wires
was placed inside the syringe, the other was wrapped around the outside
of the glass electrode tip. Differential recordings were made with a
Textronix type F 122 preamplifier with hi/low pass filters set at 8 Hz,
1 KHz,
