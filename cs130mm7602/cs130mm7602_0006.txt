homogenate was dropped onto the tip of a leg which was being recorded
from. This was at time 0, From the beginning of the trace to time 0,
very little spontaneous activity is evident. There is a brief period
of noise lasting about 1 second which ocurred during stimulation. Fol¬
lowing stimulation, there is a general increase in nervous activity
which becomes most dramatic at 5 - 7 seconds, The activity then tapers
off until the second stimulation, After this stimulus there is, once
again, a brief period of noise, immidiatly followed by intense nervous
activity. Following both stimulations, behavior, in the form of violent
thrashing motions of the legs occured. The cause of the delay in activ¬
ity in the second case is unclear and will be discussed later,
Fast Activity In The R.N.C. Due To Chemo/Tactile Vs. Electrical Stimu¬
lation
Stimulation of Ophiopteris leg by a tube foot or a stainless steel
needle ("chemo" vs "tactile" stimulation) results in electrical activity
very similar to that seen in response to brief electrical shocks applied
directly to the radial nerve chord. In the experiment illustrated in
fig. 5, electrical activity was recorded at a single side 21 mm proximal
to the site of electrical stimulation, and about 29 mm proximal to the
site of tube foot stimulation, near the tip of the leg. Three record¬
ings of each type of stimuli were obtained. The conduction velocities
are as follows (electrical vs, tube foot in each case):
0.43 m/sec vs. 0.36 m/sec (fig, 54),
0.43 m/sec vs. 0.52 m/sec (fig. 5B), and
0.41 m/sec vs. 0.63 m/sec (fig. 50).
The mean value for electrical stimulation is 0.42 m/sec; that for tube
foot stimulation is 0,50 m/sec,
