exist, These cells may be receptive to other sensory input as well.
In particular they may also be mechanoreceptors. Other starfish
including Pisaster ochraceas, and Patira miniata were not able to
elicit an escape response.
A major question which now exists is why bother to have rapidly
transmitting axons when behavior is propogated down the arm at a rate :
nearly twenty times slower? Also, how is this slow propogation ac¬
complished? The most logical theories seem to me to be ones involving
either chained reflexes or sensory feedback - böth being quite unusual
for an escape response. The mechanics of leg movement may require
such unusual pathways. The need for rapid conducting axons maybe
to synchronize the other arms or to ready the animal for an escape.
The differences in delay times preceeding increased nervous activity,
following a chemical stimulation (fig. 2.) may be accounted for by
hypothesizing that the first stimulation "primed" the animal for the
second one,
Finally, work by Smith (1950) and Kerkut (1954) has shown that
"pacemaker" centers within the nervous system are important in the
coordination of behavioral responses. These studies also suggested
that there are discrete centers which control locomotorygbehavior,
(cited by Pentreath & Cobb, 1972) With more work and newer techniques,
I think some of these "discrete centers" may be discovered and in
particular, a center controlling the coordination of escape locomotion
may be found. Indeed, one element of this "escape center" would
appear to be the class 1 axons extending down the nerve chord.
