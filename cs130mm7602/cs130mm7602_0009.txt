isolation chamber had been refilled with normal sea water, It is un¬
clear why the activity in traces 6 - 8 is reduced, but activity is
clearly present in 9. These results show that the very rapid trans¬
mission of information down the ophiuroid R.N.C. following chemo/
tactile stimulation can persist for a distance of at least two ganglia,
and probably much farther. This finding is consistent with the proposed
involvement of class 1 axons.
Conclusions
1. There is an escape response in Ophiopteris papillosa which
results from stimulation by the tube feet of Pycnopodia.
2. The escape resonse does not habituate,
3. The first visible response by Ophiopteris occurs after about
240 msec.
4. An initial wave of behavior travels down the leg at a velocity
of about 0.059 m/sec following stimulation with Pycnopodia tube feet.
5. The "leg jerk" does not require integration in the circumoral
nerve,
6. An escape ersponse can be evoked by purely chemical stimulation,
a weaker response is evoked through tactile stimulation.
7, Action potentials are evoked by both tactile and chemosensory
components.
8. The nervous units conducting these action potentials appear
to be the same as the class 1 axons studied by Tuft & Gilly (1984)
and Yee (1984). That is, they are the most rapidly conducting axons
and are probably uninterupted by chemical synapses for distances of
several centimeters,
