Discussion
Similarities between action potentials generated ty tube foot stim¬
ulation, and electrical stimulation indicate that similar, if not the
same, axons are being used to rapidly transmit information down the R.N.C,
in both cases. These axons are the fastest, and probably the largest of
Ophiopteris axons. Work done by Yee (1984) using electrical stimulation
indicates that these axons may run on the dorsal edge of the ectoneural
tissue of the nerve chord, and probably transmit sensory data. My studies
are in agreement with this, as I was definitely stimulating activity
via sensory pathways, and recording from the ectoneural portion of the
nerve chord. Therefore, giant class 1 axons mediate the rapid conduction
of sensory information, and are sensory interneurones.
Other data concerning the similarity of conduction pathways for
sensory and electrical stimuli involve the Ca free experiments. Ca
free media did not block transmission of sensory data, or fast electrical
activity (Yee, 1984; Tuft & Gilly, 1984)
At this point it is unclear whether or not Ca+ is required to get
sensory data into these hypothesised sensory interneurones; however,
behavioral data indicate that it is. In other words, chemical synapses
may be involved in the transmission of sensory cell data to the sensory
interneurone. This hypothesis may add specialized sensory cells to the
list of fine structures in echinoderms. According to Pentreath and Cobb
(1972), The evidence so far available confirms the hypothesis that epi¬
thelial cells are in part sensory in function, only rarely showing even
the simplest specialization, and that they are receptive to most stimuli
(i.e. mechanical, chemical, light, etc.). I believe a chemosensitive
cell specialized to react to some chemical component of Pycnopodia must
