by frame analysis of the videotape, The velocity of the behavior was
followed by comparing each drawing to the initial drawing, and mapÂ¬
ping out the evident displacement of the leg. The delay time to first
observable movement was calculated by averaging 20 experiments.
To test the difference between tactile and tube foot stimulation,
the animal was first placed in the middle of a rectangular container,
Following stimulation, the ophiuroid would locomote to the side of the
dish, The time taken to locomote to the side of the dish was recorded
for 10 trials using a metal probe as a stimulus, and for 10 trials using
a Pycnopodia tube foot as a stimulus. Similar trials were made using
tube feet from other starfish (Patiria miniata and Pisaster ochraceous),
but these did not result in escape responses.
Results
Ophiopteris shows a response to Pycnopodia tube feet on virtually every
body surface. The leg tip is the most sensitive spot, When the tip of
the leg is stimulated with a tube foot, the ophiopteris will almost
always exhibit a "leg jerk" response. (fig. 2. leg jerk) This response
does not appear to habituate, even after more than 100 stimulations,
given about ten seconds between stimulations. A single leg severed from
the body still exhibits the "leg jerk" response,
The "leg jerk" is propogated down the leg in the form of a wave of
behaviour, (fig. 3.) This behavior pulls the leg tip away from the
stimulus quite rapidly, Figure 3 shows the change in position of the
leg relative to the initial leg position following tube foot stimulation.
The behavior is followed through 1630 msec. Twenty such responses were
videotaped and an attempt was made to discover the average time before
an initial response was detected, there was a good range of uncertainty
