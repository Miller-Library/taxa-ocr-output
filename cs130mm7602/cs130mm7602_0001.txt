Abstract
The brittle star Ophiopteris papillosa exhibits an escape response
to the predatory asteroid Pycnopodia. Stimulation of Ophiopteris with a
tube foot of Pycnopodia evokes action potentials in the radial nerve
chord (R.N.C,), Furthermore, recordings of these action potentials are
similar both in velocity and amplitude to activity evoked by electrical
stimuli of the R.N.C. itself. Also, the axons mediating these action
potentials appear to be independant of external Ca' ions and to run
uninterupted by chemical synapses for at least several millimeters,
These axons are probably transmitting sensory information, as tube foot
stimulus is a sensory stimulation. In addition, the velocity of action
potentials in these axons are about 17 times faster than propogation
of the apparent motor output.
