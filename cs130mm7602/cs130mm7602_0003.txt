The tube foot stimulator consisted of a tube foot placed at the
end of a bar which was attached to the movable breaker of a D.C, relay,
At the click of a switch, a sweep on the ocilloscope was triggered, and
the relay was simultaneously activated to pull down the bar upon which
a tube foot hadobèen placed, The tube foot would then (in the ideal
situation) strike the tip of the leg which was being recorded from,
A refrigeration unit ranpbèneath the preparation to maintain a
temperature of 13 - 15°0. This helped keep the preparation fresh, and
standardized temperatures,
Ca free experiments used the same set up; however,the portion
of the leg which was being recorded from was placed in an isolation
chamber. The isolation chamber consisted simply of a vial cap, and
plasticine clay which made a relatively water tight seal around the
leg. (See fig. 1.)
The animal was placed upside down and restrained with pins that
went around the leg and into a substrate of Sylgard gel. The ophiuroid
was then dissected simply by removal of segmental arm plates on the oral
surface.
Behavioral observations were made by stimulating the tip of the
leg with a Pycnopodia tube foot. The Ophiopteris in question was
usually in a horizontal position in a glass or plastic container,
a natural habitat, Ophiopterus is frequently found in a crevice in a
vertical position, with only the leg tips protruding out.
To study the time course of the "leg jerk" response, the animal
was videotaped as it was being stimulated by a Pycnopodia tube foot,
The results were then drawn onto an acetate sheet, directly off the
video screen. (See fig, 3.) The time course was followèd in a frame
