as to when the leg was stimulated, and as to when the first movement
occured, The-average response time was 242 msec, - 94 msec (S.D., N=20),
Figure 4 shows the velocity at which the leg jerk response in fig
8, propogates down the leg. The behavioral propogation is fairly con¬
stant at about 0.059 m/sec for the first 3.5 cm. It then decreases
greatly. Following the "leg jerk", the ophiuroid will exhibit a fairly
stereotyped pattern of whole body responses, In this, the two legs
opposite to the one stimulated pull back, dragging the whole animal away
from the site of stimulation. (fig. 2, locomotion) These two legs are
reextended and may pull back for one or two more cycles. At this point
the animal will use a great variety of forms of locomotion, seemingly
with no clear preferance.
In experiments comparing escapes from a tactile stimulus (probe)
to escapes from tube foot, the average time spent in locomotion follow¬
ing stimulation was 52 seconds for tactile vs, 31.7 seconds for tube
foot. The escape speed from tube foot stimulus was 1,6 times faster
than it was for tactile stimuli.
At times the Ophiopteris will feed on the surface film of the water,
with all tube feet on the feeding leg extended, Stimulation of a single
tube foot with a Pycnopodia tube foot results in contraction of the four
tube feet adjacent to the one stimulated, and the five tube feet on the
opposite side of the leg. The rest of the tube feet remain extended,
Poking a single tube foot with a metal probe resulted in only that tube
foot contracting, This shows another difference between tactile and
tube foot stimul:.
