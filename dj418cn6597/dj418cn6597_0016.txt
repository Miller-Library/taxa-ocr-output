Adults (see fig. 11)
The only previously described P. pugettensis
adult is the female (Holmes, 1900; Rathbun, 1918;
Wells, 1928; and Schmitt et al, 1973). Males found
during the present study differ from females in
Adult
numerous respects. females are characteristically
adult
translucent and soft shelled, males are brown and
hard shelled. Females have rounded smooth chelae and
legs with short trailing hairs, males have flattened
legs with longer trailing hairs and their chelae
are angular and sculptured to fit the contours of the
front of the carapace. Female chelae are not sculptured
to fit the front of the carapace. Males are characteristically
smaller than females. There are at least five molts
female and three in the
male (see
in the
fig. 12). Specimens have been deposited in the Allan
Hancock Foundation, University of Southern California,
and the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco.
Eight males were found outside of tunicates, in
our collecting bags and,aquaria where specimens of
tyela were kept. No free-living males were found
except these which were on or with specimens of Styela.
Only one female was found outside a tunicate and that
was in a stagnant bowl inadvertently left for several
days -- all tunicates in the bowl were dead; four males
and a female crab were found outside of the tunicates
