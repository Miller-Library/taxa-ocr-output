ascidian behind the pocket containing the crab were
reduced in both size and number). Where more than
one crab was present in the tunicate, each crab had
its own hole; one crab occurred in the usual position
while the additional crab was located either at the same
level in the atrium on the opposite side of the pharynx,
or lower down in the atrium on the same side as the first
crab.
The position of the crab in the host, and the
neat hole in the pharyngeal wall of the tunicate,
strongly suggested thatt the crab was feeding on the
mucus rope formed at the ascidian dorsal lamina.
S. montereyensis is a suspension feeder, like all
ascidians, and collects food particles by passing surrounding
water through mucus nets. These nets, which line the
pharyngeal cavity, are secreted by the endostyle, then
passed across the gill slits on both sides of the pharynx
until they reach the dorsal lamina where the sheets from
each side are rolled together into a rope and passed down
to the ascidian esophagus (see Jørgensen, 1966; Fiala¬
Médioni, 1978; Flood and Fiala-Médioni, 1979). To test
whether the crab might be feeding on this mucus rope,
phytoplankton marked with "Aquadag" colloidal graphite
or powdered carmine was pipetted into the region of the
oral siphons of submerged, feeding tunicates. Each of
25 subtidally obtained Styelas was fed for 10-15
minutes. For an additional 15-45 minutes each ascidian
was submerged in seawater containing a less concentrated
