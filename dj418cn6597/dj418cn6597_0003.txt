this one running along the length of the endostyle. By
dissecting the tunicate in this manner the crab, in the
atrial cavity, is minimally disturbed; when incisions were
made down either side of the body laterally or on the
dorsal side, the crab usually became active and broke
through the pharyngeal wall into the pharyngeal cavity
of the tunicate. Perhaps this type of action accounts
for at least some of the reported instances of pea
crabs being found in the pharyngeal basket of ascidians
(e.g. Fay and Johnson, 1971).
Crabs found in dissections were removed from the
tunicate, measure with an ocular micrometer, and kept
in running seawater in individual compartments of ice
cube trays fitted with screened plexiglass tops. They
were fed Artemia naupli intermittently, we are uncertain
whether or not they were eaten.
In tunicate and crab feeding experiments, phytoplankton
suspensions (Chaetoceros gracilis and Isochrysis galbana),
colored black with "Aquadag" colloidal graphite or
red with powdered carmine, were used. Tunicates
used in feeding experiments were placed in 10% formalin
and seawater overnight and then dissected.
Various methods of anesthesia were tried in the
course of the dissections. The most successful procedure
was to "tranquilize" the tunicates first in a solution
of menthol in seawater for several minutes then place
