Peters and Rothman
Hopkins natural history notes:
1) Approximately 350 Styela montereyensis were
collected from the subtidal sites marked on the
following map.
2) Styela were found to have excellent regenerative
abilities, healing damage to the pharynx, mantle and
tunic. Many radical operations were performed with
a low mortality rate, one Styela had its tunic removed
from siphons to stalk, and survived for two weeks,
at which time it was sacrificed.
Taking advantage of the Styelas ability to survive
severe trauma, the authors sewed several windows into
tunicates. A longitudinal incisison was cut through the
tunic, then the mantle, or the mantle and pharynx were
cut, again longitudinally. The window was then sewn
into place using 000 stainless steel sutures. The
window was made of 1/8 inch plexiglass with 1/32" holes
drilled in its perimeter at 1/2" intervals. The window
provided a clear view of the interior ofthe tunicate.
The tunicates operated on survived for at least two weeks.
This method is workable, but has several disadvantages,
it is time consuming, care must be exercised to avoid the
gonads on first incision or they will obsturct the window,
and the amount of force necessary to sew through the
tough tunic may disrupt the tunicate's internal order.
