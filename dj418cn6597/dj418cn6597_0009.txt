mixture of the marker and plankton, finally the animal
was killed in a 10% formalin 90% seawater solution.
Subsequently the tunicates were dissected and the
pharynxes opened. The mucus rope was usually well
stained, appearing bright red or black dependent upon
the marker used. Nine P. pugettensis were found
within these ascidians, and all were carefully removed.
Six crabs had the mouthparts and chelipeds stained
with the colored mucus, and one was found clutching the
mucus rope. Of the above six crabs, three contained
dyed food particles in their cardiac stomachs.
P. pugettensis does not leave the host to forage,
or even move about much within the host atrium, as
indicated by the pocket created by the tissue strands
and blood vessels encircling the crab.
The hole in the ascidian pharynx was always small
and almost always well healed, indicating the injury was
not recent, and that the crab was not actively eating the
pharyngeal tissue. Tunicates containing some of the
larger crabs often showed additional scaring of the
pharyngeal wall directly next to the body of the crab,
but never another hole. S. montereyensis, in the lab,
were able to completely heal holes cut in the pharyngeal
wall within 1-2 weeks. Further, the crab was always
