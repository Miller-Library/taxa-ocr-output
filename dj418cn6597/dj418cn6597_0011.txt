Christensen and MoDermott, 1958; Silas and Alararswami,
1967). An examination of crab mouthparts shows no
obvious adaptions for filter feeding, and it seems
unlikely that the crab could get sufficient quantities
of particulate food through the network of the pharyngeal
basket, even on occasions when the mucus sheet is not
being secreted. It would seem far more advantagous for
the crab to take advantage of the highly efficient
filtering and collecting mechanisms of the tunicate.
by simply stealing portions of the mucus rope as it is
being passed back to the ascidian esophagus.
The pea crab obtains both food and shelter from
S. montereyensis. The food-robbing process probably
produces only a small loss
to the ascidian
host. Further stress may be placed on the host by
disrupted tissue strands and blood vessels, the hole
in the pharynx, slight damage to the dorsal lamina, and
some disruption of the gonads. The reduced testes would
be expected to reduce the tunicates reproductive fitness.

Pinnotheres pisun
for
in the mussel Mytilus edulis, and Christensen
and MeDermott (1968) for Pinnotheres ostreum in the oyster
Crassostrea yirginica. However, this may be relatively
insignificant in Styela, since testes are very numerous
and those on the opposite side and below the crab appear
unaffected. Additionally the ovaries appear undisturbed
