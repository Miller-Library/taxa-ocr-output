abdominal plate. A brooding female removed from
the tunicate
often brushed away the excess eggs
with her legs and chelae, regardless of the developmental
state of the eggs. The remaining eggs under the abdominal
plate developed and hatched normally.
Expectant females were placed in quart jars in a
seawater bath, following the methods of Irvine and
Coffin (1960) who were successful in raising the larva
of Fabia subquadrata. When larva hatched they were
divided into groups of 30-50 and placed in individual
jars in the seawater bath. Depth of water in the jars and
seawater bath was 15-20cm. Temperature of the bath was
10-15°0 during the course of experiment


Larva were fed Artemia nauplii and had their water
changed daily. All larval measurements were made
using an ocular micrometer.
Developement
The eggs of P. pugettensis hatched directly to
an advanced zoea stage. There was no free protozoea.
Amolt occurred after 10-12 days to a second zoea
stage. At 21-24 days this second zoea moltéd to a
megalops stage. At 28-30 days this megalops molted
to the first juvenile crab instar.
