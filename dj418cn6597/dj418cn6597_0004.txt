them in MS 222 (Ethyl m-aminobensoate, methanesulphonic
acid salt 98%, Aldrich) diluted 1:2000 for five to ten
minutes. This method, however, never completely relaxed
the tunicates. Neither menthol nor MS 222 seemed to have
any effect upon the crab.
Distribution
In the course of the study, 222 subtidal and 25
intertidal Styela montereyensis were collected. In
the subtidal tunicates, 73 Pinnotheres pugettensis were found;
49 were females, and 24 were identified as males.
However, sex identification of the smallest individuals
was difficult. Eight male P. pugettensis were found
outside of S. montereyensis in collecting bags and
in which S
vela were kept.
aquaria The overall infection rate of the subtidal
Styela population was 32.9%. No crabs were found in
intertidal S. montereyensis.
In order to obtain an accurate and useful measure
of tunicate size the authors compared body volume and
body length. Measurements of the stalk were omitted
because its length was highly variable and did not
correlate well with body size. When body length is
plotted against body volume it becomes apparent that
the variance in body volume is less then that for
body length, (see Fig. 1). Consequently body volume was
used as a measure of tunicate size.
