crabs legs were held closely against the body; not
grasping the tissues of the ascidian. Connective tissue
ascidian
strands and blood vessels joining the mantle to the
pharynx were interrupted by the presence of the
crab, but these same tissues in the area surrounding
the crab remained intact, thus the crab was maintained
in position in a sort of pocket. P. pugettensis was
found in either the left or right side of the atrial
cavity, but always with the mouthparts and chelae
within 3mm or less of the dorsal lamina, and facing it.
A crab on the right was positioned as in fig. 5a, a
crab on the left was rotated 180 degrees. Crabs
positioned dorsally in the atrium were oriented with the
mouth in the closest proximity to the dorsal lamina of Styela
(see fig. 5b).
A consistent feature of S. montereyensis containing
P. pugettensis in the atrium was a hole in that part of
the pharyngeal wall located close to the mouth of
the crab (see fig. 6 and 7). This hole was 1-3.5mm
in diameter, its size positively correlated with the
size of the crab. The hole appeared well healed, the
edges were smooth, and the blood vessels of the pharynx
were fused and diverted around the hole. Slight damage
was occasionally observed to the dorsal lamina in the
region next to the hole. (Additionally, when the
crab infecting a tunicate was large the testes of the
