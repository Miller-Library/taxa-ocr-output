females that were collected free-living. No free-living
females were collected or observed by the authors.
The sizes of the adult females, their gross morphology,
and their locomotory limitations make it hard to envision
them free-living. Silas and Alagarswami, 1967, in a review
of the literature find no evidence for free-living
adult female Pinnotheres. The male being smaller and
more motile might perhaps leave the host to breed,
explaining the large number of males found outside of
tunicates, though no breeding behavior was observed.
Summary
The commensal pea crab Pinnotheres pugettensis
inhabits about 33% of the subtidal population of its
ascidian host, Styela montereyensis, in southern Monterey
Bay, California. No pea crabs were found in intertidal
S. montereyensis. Of 247 tunicates dissected 62 contained
one crab, four held two crabs and one tunicate contained
three crabs. There was never more than one adult female
P. pugettensis per tunicate. The crabs Iive in the
in the anterior third of the atrial cavity of the tunicate,
and feed by reaching into the pharyngeal cavity, through
a small well-healed hole situated dorsally in the pharyngeal
wall, and taking pieces of the rope of mucus and trapped
food particles rolled up by the ascidian dorsal lamina,
We saw no evidence of filter feeding by adult P.
pugettensis. Eggs hatch as advanced zoeae, which molt
to a second zoeal stage in 10-12 days, to a megalops at
20-24 days, and to the first juvenile instar at 28-30
