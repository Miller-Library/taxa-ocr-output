Several female crabs removed from tunicates were placed
in screened boxes with S. montereyensis. They attempted
to re-enter the tunicates. In one test, seven out of
eight females chose the oral siphon and one chose the
atrial siphon. In another experiment two females suceessfully
entered a tunicate already containing another female; both
intruders entered the oral siphon and were found one day later in
the pharynx. When females were placed in a box with the
ascidian Ciona intestinalis they ignored the tunicate,
but climbed on a Styela montereyensis when offered.
Only two males from nine trials successfully reentered
a tunicate; they entered the atrial siphon. Of the
cases of double and triple infestations, males were
found with males, males with females, but no females
with females were found.
Discussion
Pinnotheres pugettensis passes through two zoeal
stages and a megalops stage. It is not known at which
stage the crab invades the host. Phototactic response
decreases at each successive larval stage, suggesting
that, though possibly dispersed during the first zoeal
stage, the larvae tend to settle towards the bottom and
therefore toward their potential host. The relatively
advanced first zoea and the short larval cycle of 28-30
days also suggest that P. pugettensis larvae
