tend to remain in the micro-habitat of their host. No
megalopae were ever seen inside a tunicate. This does
not exclude the possibility that a megalops may enter
and then molt into a juvenile crab, but megalopae and
the one first stage juvenile instar collected did not appear
attracted to Styela when placed in close proximity with
the host.
Only one crab, tentatively identified as a male, was
found in the pharyngeal cavity of a Styela. On close
examination there appeared to be no hole through the pharyngeal
(carapace 0.9 x 1.0
wall into the atrial cavity. This crab was larger,than
the first stage juvenile instar (carapace 0.58 x 0.69mm).
but was the smallest crab found in a tunicate and the
only one not found in the atrial cavity. It was also
smaller than the smallest crab feeding hole found in the
pharynx of any Styela (1.0 x 1.0 mm). Perhaps one
of the juvenile instars is the first invasive stage,
entering the tunicate first through the oral siphon and
then breaking through the pharyngeal wall into the atrial
cavity where it takes up residence. This might also
explain the formation of a pocket by the invading crab,
and the tendency of adult females removed from the host to
reenter through the oral rather than the atrial siphon.
Very small males (2.8 x 2.8 mm) were found in Styela
with feeding holes, while most males found outside the
tunicates were relatively large (4.0 x 4.Omm to 6.4x 6.4mm).
There is one report of a male found free by F. A. Pitelka
on the holdfasts of the sea grass Phyllospadix (cited in Schmitt,
et al, 1973); Rathbun (1918) also reports two
