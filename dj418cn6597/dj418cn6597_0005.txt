No statistically significant difference in body
volume was found between intertidal and subtidal
populations of Styela (Student's t-test, p-.02). An
Rx C contingency test showed the difference in P.
pugettensis infection rates between subtidal and
intertidal Styela populations to be highly significant
(pÂ£.01). Some caution, however, must be exercisized
when interpreting these results; 19 of the intertidal
Styela were collected at Wharf no. 2, but none of the
six subtidal tunicates found at the Wharf contained
P. pugettensis. The difference in infection rates may
be due to some other factor than differences in tidal height.
Of the infected tunicates 62 contained one crab,
four held two crabs, and one tunicate contained three
much
adult
crabs. Male crabs were generally,smaller thangfemales.
Males had an average carapace width of 4.Omm (SDt1.6imm).
The smallest male had a carapace width of 1.Omm and
carapace length of 0.9mm; the largest male was 6.8mmx 6.Omm.
Female crabs had an average carapace width of 8.2mm
(SDt1.5mm). The smallest female had a carapace 5.2mm x 5.2mm,
while the largest was limmx iimm.
There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.35)
between crab carapace width and body volume of the
tunicate (see Fig. 2). This positive relationship
between host size and crab size has been found in other
Pinnotheridae (Pearce, 1966a; Christensen and MeDermott,
