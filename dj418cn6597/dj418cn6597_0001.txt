Introduction
The pea crab Pinnotheres pugettensis (Holmes, 1900)
is known from Departure Bay, B.C. and Puget Sound,
Washington, where it occurs in the ascidians Halocynthia
aurantium, H. hilgendorfi igaboja and Ascidia paratropa,
and from Monterey Bay, California where it was recently
discovered in the ascidian Styela montereyensis (Dall,
872) by C. C. Lambert (Garth and Abbott, 1980). The
range of P. pugettensis may extend even further south;
a pea crab was found in one S. montereyensis collected
at Pt. Loma, California (Fay and Johnson, 1971).
Pinnotheres taylori
Pinnaxa faba, and Fabia subquadrata, however
have also been reported from Pacific ascidian hosts
(Schmitt, et al, 1973).
Pinnotheres pugettensis has not been extensively studied.
Very little is known of its occurrence, it position in
and relation to the host ascidian, its methods of feeding,
and its developement. The present research was undertaken
to try and answer some questions in these areas, using
the P. pugettensis population in S. montereyensis
from southern Monterey Bay.
The ascidians studied often harbored the notodelphyid
(Iiig)
copepod Pygodelphys aquilonaris, known on this coast from
studies in Washington, (e.g. Illg, 1958; Dudley, 1966).
Some notes on its occurrence in S. montereyensis in
Monterey are included.
