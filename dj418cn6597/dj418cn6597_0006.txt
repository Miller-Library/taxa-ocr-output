Peters and Rothman
1958 ; and Silas and Alagarswami, 1967). This
correlation is better (r = 0.56) if the few cases
of multiple infections are omitted. The rate of
infection varied with tunicate body volume; additionally,
as volume increased, fewer males and more females
were found (see fig. 3).
The infection rate of subtidal S. montereyensis
by the copepod Pygodelphys aquilonaris was 30.2%.
No copepods were found in Styela taken intertidally.
An Rx C contingency test showed the difference between
the intertidal and the subtidal infection rates to be
highly significant (pÂ«.01). However, subtidal Styela
at Wharf no. 2 lacked copepods, just as they lacked
pinnotherid crabs. The infection rate with P.
aquilonaris varied with the size of the tunicate (see
fig. 3). Multiple infections were fairly common; the
largest number of copepods within a single host tunicate
was 15 (see fig. 4). Copepods were found only within the
ascidian pharynx.
Position and feeding of crab in host
Of the total of 73 Pinnotheres pugettensis found
in Styela montereyensis, one crab was found within
the branchial basket, while 72 were located in the
anterior third of the atrial cavity. The ventral
surface of the crab was always in contact with the
pharynx, the dorsal surface towards the tunic. The
