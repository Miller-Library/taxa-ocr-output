Peters and Rothman
Materials and Methods
Specimens of S. montereyensis were collected between
April and June 1980. Subtidal collections were made from
depths of 15 to 35 feet in kelp beds at Mussel Pt.,
and
Pacific Grove;,Pt. Alones and Wharf no. 2, Monterey,
sing SCUBA. Intertidal collections were made by hand
at Pescadero Pt., Monterey Peninsula, as well as at
Mussel Pt. and Wharf no. 2. Specimens were kept alive
in tanks at Hopkins Marine Station, where they were
suspended from styrofoam floats by plastic clips clasping
the base of the stalk. Aquaria were supplied with
running seawater at 10-15Â°0, a temperature generally
within three degrees of ambient local ocean temperatures.
Tunicate body volumes were measured by immersing the
body (but not the stalk) of the contracted specimen
in a 100 ml graduated cylinder of seawater and noting
displacement.
S. montereyensis shows no external evidence of
presence or absence of a pea crab. After initial trials,
all tunicates were dissected by making a longitudinal
slit through the tunic from the base of the oral
siphon at the anterior end down to the beginning
of the stalk. The tunic was pulled aside to reveal
the translucent mantle, within which a crab if present,
could usually be observed. The mantle and the pharynx
were then opened with a cut similar to the first incision,
