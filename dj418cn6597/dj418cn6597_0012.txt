by the presence of a crab. No evidence was found in
S. montereyensis of severe enlargement of the mantle
or atrial cavity toaccommodate individual crabs as
aurantium from
shown for Halocynthia (-Tethyum)
Puget Sound infested with P. pugettensis(see Wells, 1928).
In our estimation, the damage sustained by S.
montereyensis is relatively minor. No quantitative
measure of food taken was made, but the S. montereyensis
containing crabs were not significantly smaller than
S. montereyensis without crabs. In general the
destruction appeared much less severe then that caused
by the behavior of some other commensal crabs, particularly
those infecting bivalves, Fabia subquadrata, Pinnixa faba,
P. littoralis (see Pearce, 1966, 1966a; Anderson, 1975) and
Pinnotheres ostreum (see Sandoz and Hopkins, 1947;
Christensen and McDermott, 1958)
Larval Stages
Twenty living gravid females were obtained from
tunicate dissections in the course of this study. Eight
of them subsequently hatched larvae. Immature eggs were
maroon in color, changing to orange as they developed,
and then to a light tan 4-5 days prior to hatching. One
ovigerous female (9.0 x 9.0 mm) contained approximately
2700 eggs. Developing eggs overflowed the sides of the
