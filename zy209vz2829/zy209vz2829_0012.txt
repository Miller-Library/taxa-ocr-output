factors can correspond to clines in the allozymes responsible for dealing with these factors.
Mitochondrial haplotypes often also follow this cline (reviewed in Palumbi 1994). If one species
of Nucella is better adapted to certain environmental condition(s) in a particular location, natural
selection could prevent the other species from being able to establish a population. It is then
possible that the patterns observed in COI could be reflecting this selection.
Genetic structure is evident over small geographic ranges in Nucella in central California.
Further collection of snails in the zone of overlap between the two species will hopefully shed
light on what is responsible for the distribution of each species - whether it is determined by an
environmental gradient, or if physical barriers are the major factor, or if distribution is the result
of random migration events in the past. Additional geographic locations would also allow the
determination of whether Nucella species follow either the isolation by distance or stepping
stone models. In order to examine these questions, more snails will be collected between
Soberanes Point and San Luis Obispo at various distances apart to continue to determine the
small-scale genetic structure of these two species.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Stephen Palumbi for his guidance and all of his time, as well as for
collecting snails. An additional thank you to the entire Palumbi lab for all of their help and
support, and especially for teaching me new lab techniques. And to Peter Marko, thank you for
the technical advice and the help with identifying snail shells.
