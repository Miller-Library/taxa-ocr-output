DISCUSSION
Both N. emarginata and N. ostrina were found in central California, as expected based on
previous work (Marko 1998, Marko 2003). Even though it is the southern of the two species, N.
emarginata was found at the two northern sites at Hopkins Marine Station and Point Joe, while
N. ostrina was found at the two southern sites at Soberanes Point and San Luis Obispo. A brief
glance at the phylogenetic trees suggests, and the results of bootstrapping confirm, that all four
of these locations are genetically distinct populations (P + 0.0001). This result is expected, since
Nucella populations are very isolated from each other. Although low larval dispersal does not
always lead to genetic differentiation over distance (McFadden and Aydin 1996), isolation
between populations is also observed in other low dispersal species, including some copepods
(Burton et al. 1979) and some corals (Hellberg 1994). Rather than releasing larvae into the
ocean where they can be carried hundreds of kilometers away as many marine invertebrates do,
Nucella lay egg cases in which the embryonic snails develop before emerging as juvenile snails.
Individual snails then do not move very far during their lifetime (see West 1986 for snail
movement over a 4 month period). Gene flow is thus very limited between separate populations
and the genetic structure of a population is determined almost entirely by local egg production.
Laboratory studies also show that little or no hybridization occurs between the two species
(Marko, pers. comm.), which would further reduce the possibility of genetic mixing of
populations.
Each geographic location additionally only has one of the two species. However, there
are two possible exceptions. First, one snail from Hopkins Marine Station (E7) clusters with the
snails from Soberanes Point. It is possible that this individual is actually an N. emarginata with
