(HMS) in Pacific Grove (36°37’N, 121°54’W), thirteen snails were collected in the wave
protected area near the pilings and twenty-one snails were collected in a wave exposed area. At
Point Joe (JOE) (36°36’N, 121°57W2), six snails were collected in a wave exposed area, five
snails were collected in an area with moderate wave exposure and two snails were collected in a
wave protected area. At Soberanes Point (SÖB), eight snails were collected from a wave-
exposed area near the USGS benchmark (36°22’30"N, 121°52’30“W). In San Luis Obispo
(SLO) (35°20’N, 120°43’W), seven snails were collected in a wave protected area in St. Luis
Harbor, near Pismo Beach. The shell morphology of snails was examined and shell coloration,
shell texture, the number of whorls, angular vs. rounded "shoulder", and the presence of an
adapical tooth were recorded. Snails were additionally photographed. Äfter the examination of
shell morphology, snails were placed in an isotonic solution of magnesium chloride (MgCl) for
30- 60 minutes in order to relax their muscles. A snail was considered to be relaxed when it no
longer withdrew into its shell when touched. A small piece of foot-tissue was then biopsied.
Tissue was digested and DNA was extracted using the Nucleospin Tissue Kit (Machery-
Nagel/BD Biosciences).
PCR and Sequencing. A 463 bp fragment from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c
oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Several
previously published COI primers were tried, including the universal primers COla and COlf
(Palumbi), the universal primers 1490 and 2198 (Folmer 1994) and the Nucella canliculata COl
primers COIM-L and COIM-H (Sanford 2003). These primers, for the most part, did not result
in successful amplifications, so new primers were designed from published N. emarginata and N.
