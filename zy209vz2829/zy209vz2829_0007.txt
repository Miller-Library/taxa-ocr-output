between populations. All sequences were additionally compared to published sequences for N.
emarginata and N. ostrina (Genbank accession numbers AF076536-AF076560) to determine
which species were present within a geographic location. Following the “cleaning" of sequences
and the preliminary analysis using Sequencher"" 4.1, the consensus sequences were transferred
to PAUP“4.Ob10 (PPC) to create phylogenetic trees based on a parsimony analysis. Consensus
sequences were also analyzed using heap big Power Mac (program by S. Palumbi) to calculate
variation within and among geographic locations, as well as the corresponding Fsr value. The
Fsr value was calculated by dividing the variation within a population by the variation between
the populations and subtracting this answer from one. A bootstrap analysis was then performed
to calculate P-values.
RESULTS
Morphology. Shells from both N. emarginata and N. ostrina exhibited a wide range of
morphologies (Fig. 1). Shell colors ranged from light (white, various shades of gray, and tan) to
dark (black, brown, and maroon). Some shells additionally had stripes. Certain morphs of both
species had smooth shells, but only N. emarginata exhibited a highly knobby shell. Both species
had between four and six body whorls and could have either angular or rounded shoulders. The
presence of an adapical tooth was only observed in N. emarginata.
PCR and sequencing. Performing PCR with the universal primers 1490 and 2198
(Folmer) yielded no amplification products (Fig. 2). PCR with the universal primers COla and
COIf (Palumbi) either yielded no amplification products or products with multiple bands (Fig.
3). PCR with the primers COIM-H and COIM-L (Sanford) yielded good amplifications about
55% of the time (Fig. 4), but the corresponding sequences contained ambiguous bases at several
