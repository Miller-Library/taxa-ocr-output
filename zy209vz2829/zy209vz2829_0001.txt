Abstract. The cryptic gastropod species Nucella emarginata and Nucella ostrina are distributed
along the northeastern Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja, California. N. emarginata is found
primarily in the south and N. ostrina is found primarily in the north, with their ranges
overlapping in central California. Snails (7- 34 individuals) from four locations in the overlap
zone were collected and their population structures were studied using an approximately 500 bp
fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Contrary to what
might be expected, analysis showed snails from the southern locations of Soberanes Point and
San Luis Obispo are both N. ostrina (the northern species), while snails from the northern
locations at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove and Point Joe are both N. emarginata.
Although populations in each location are fairly homogenous, small amounts of variation do
exist within each population (i.e. some polymorphisms are present). Of particular note is the
variation that exists between snails collected from a wave exposed area at Hopkins Marine
Station and snails in a wave protected area on the other side of the same point. Despite this intra-
population variation, each location forms a genetically distinct group. Further sampling in
central California will give more insight into the distribution of Nucella over short geographical
distances and will hopefully elucidate more of these speciesâ€™ evolutionary histories, as well as
possibly helping to determine what factors are important in Nucella distribution.
