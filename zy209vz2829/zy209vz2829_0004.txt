reproductive isolation caused by a biogeographic boundary, possibly at Point Conception. The
current overlap of species in central California could then be the result of northward range
expansion by N. emarginata.
This study focuses on a closer examination of the distribution of Nucella in central
California, from Pacific Grove to San Luis Obispo (approximately 240 km away). We examined
the population structure by looking at cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COl), a mitochondrial
gene involved in the electron transport chain during respiration. COl is highly conserved across
species, so variations within this locus can give insight into evolutionary relationships.
Polymorphisms within this gene additionally provide a reliable method for distinguishing
between N. emarginata and N. ostrina. The use of COI therefore allows the determination of the
distribution of species along the central California coast. The genetic structure of these
populations can be used to provide additional information about the evolutionary history of
Nucella, as well helping to explain what causes the observed distribution. It can be tested
whether sharp changes in genetic structure occur at biogeographic boundaries (see Avise 1992)
or if there is some other physical boundary responsible for the shift. It would also be possible to
determine if the distribution of Nucella in central California is dependent on other factors, such
as temperature, salinity or wave exposure gradients. In the future, if shifts were observed in the
range of either of these species, it could then be possible to relate these changes to climate
change or to changes in other environmental factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection and DNA extraction. Nucella species were collected at four different
sites along the California coast between April 23 - May 24, 2003. At Hopkins Marine Station
