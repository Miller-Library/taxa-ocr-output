dilution) was added to a reaction mix consisting of 16.4 uL ddH2O, 2.5 uL 1OX PCR buffer, 2.5
uL dNTPs (8 mM), 1.25 uL each primer (10 mM) and 0.3 uL AmpliTaq polymerase. The PCR
profile consisted of a 2 min incubation at 94°C, followed by 36 cycles of 94 °C for 30 sec, 60 °C
for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide.
The products of successful PCR amplifications were then prepared for sequencing as
follows: PCR product (5 uL) was added to 2 uL Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP), 1 uL
Exonuclease I (EXO) and 0.5 uL dilution buffer and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min,
followed by 80 °C for 15 min. This reaction removes excess dNTPs and primer dimers. SAP
product (2 uL) was then added to 6 uL ddH2O, 1 uL Big Dye, 1.5 uL 5X buffer, and 0.5 uL
primer (10 mM). This reaction mixture was then cycle sequenced for 25 cycles of 96°C for 10
sec, 50 °C for 5 sec, and 60 °C for 4 min in order to add fluorescent dye to the nucleotide bases.
After cycle sequencing, DNA was precipitated with 40 uL of 75% isopropanol for 15 min and
then pelleted by spinning at approximately 3200 rpm for 1 hour. Excess isopropanol was
removed by inverting the opened tubes and spinning them at 700 rpm for 2 min. Samples were
resuspended in 20 uL of High Dye, heated at 96 °C and then sequenced using an ABI3100
Genetic Analyzer.
Analysis of sequences. Sequences were viewed using Sequencher"" 4.1. Both the
sequence of bases and their corresponding chromatograms were examined and sections of
sequence with unclear chromatograms (i.e. where obvious, individual peaks were not present)
were removed. The forward primer and reverse primer sequences for each snail were compared
and then combined into a single consensus sequence. These consensus sequences were aligned
by assembling them into a contig and then were examined for polymorphisms, both within and
-6-
