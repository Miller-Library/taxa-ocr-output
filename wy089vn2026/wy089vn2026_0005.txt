(192-205) of rabbit Serca 2 were synthesized and used to immunize four rabbits. Serum
IgG purification was performed using ImmunoPure Affinity Pak protein A columns
following the instructions provided (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Two affinity columns were
made by immobilization of the 5 mg of the synthesized peptides provided by Research
Genetics using a EDC/Diaminodipropylamine Immobilization Kit and the included
protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 1 ml of the IgG fractions from the protein A columns
followed by 2 ml of PBS (phosphate buffered saline) were applied to the appropriate
affinity column and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The columns were
washed with an additional 14 ml of PBS after which the antibodies were eluted with 0.1
M glycine pH 3.0. 1 ml fractions were collected and their absorbance at 280 nm was
monitored to determine the protein peak. Peak fractions were pooled, brought back to
neutral pH and stored at -80Â°C until use.
Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blots
Heart SR microsomes, HSR, and LSR fractions were run on 7.5% or 3-12% SDS
polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli, 1970. Gels were either stained
with Coomassie blue or blotted onto PVDF membranes which were subsequently blocked
in 5% nonfat milk, 0.2% Tween, and 0.02% NaAzide in PBS for 1 hour. Blots were
incubated in 1:750 SERCA 2 antibody overnight at room temperature. Blots were washed
3x in PBS and subsequently incubated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody/alkaline
phosphatase conjugate diluted 1:1000 for 1.5 hours. Blots were developed with
BCIP/NBT.
