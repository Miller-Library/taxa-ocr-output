Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake in heart SR preparations was measured
using the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2 and a Shimadzu RF 5301
spectroflourophotometer. SR microsomes were added at a final concentration of 1.5
mg/ml to a cuvette containing 1.4 ml calcium transport buffer (95.0 mM KCl, 20 mM HÂ¬
MOPS, 7.5 mM NaPyrophosphate), 5.0 mM creatine phosphate, 0.01 mg/ml creatine
phosphokinase and 1.5 uM fura-2. Extravesicular calcium was monitored as a ratio of
the fura-2 fluorescence emission intensity at 510 nm at excitation wavelengths 340 nm
and 380 nm. Calcium uptake was initiated with the addition of 2.5 mM MgATP and
allowed to proceed to equilibrium. Subsequential 15 nmol additions of CaClz were added
to the cuvette to load the vesicles. At the end of the experiment, 1 mM CaClz was added
followed by 20 mM EGTA.
Results
Purification of sarcoplasmic reticulum
The homogenate, microsomal, light sarcoplasmic reticulum (LSR) and heavy
sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) fractions of bluefin and yellowfin ventricle were run on a
3-12% SDS-PAGE that was stained with Coomassie blue (Fig. 2). The homogenate
retains contractile filaments, as evidenced by the band at the 207 kDa molecular weight
marker, myosin. In the microsomal, LSR, and HSR preparations, the band at 207 kDa is
less dense, demonstrating the removal of contractile proteins during the purification
process. Also in these fractions, there is an enrichment of a band at about 110 kDa,
which, from previous work, has been shown to be SERCA 2 (Brandl et al, 1986).
