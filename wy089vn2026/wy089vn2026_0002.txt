of calcium in muscle cells that plays an important role in cardiac muscle contractility by
regulating intracellular calcium concentration. (Fig. 1) (Tibbits et al, 1992). Release of
calcium from the SR through the ryanodine receptors initiates muscle contraction
whereas uptake of calcium by an SR CaATPase (SERCA) results in muscle relaxation.
Cardiac cells have a unique isoforms of these proteins (Brandle et al, 1986; Franck et al,
1998).
Mammals rely primarily on SR release and uptake of calcium during the
contraction and relaxation cycle (Tibbits et al, 1992). The primary reliance of SR stores
of calcium in mammals creates a shorter diffusion distance for calcium. This permits an
increased rate of relaxation of the heart, a higher heart rate, and thus, an increased cardiac
output. With an increased cardiac output, mammals and birds can deliver oxygen to their
tissues at a higher rate, sustaining their high metabolic rates. This suggests that the high
metabolic rates of mammals are correlated with the reliance on SR calcium cycling in
heart cells.
In contrast to mammals, in most fish, tension is developed primarily through
calcium derived from the extracellular space. Calcium entry into the cytoplasm is
mediated by the plasma membrane voltage gated channel, or dihydropuridine receptor
(DHPR) (Tibbits et al, 1992). Calcium is removed from the heart by a plasma membrane
calcium ATPase (PMCA) and the sodium-calcium exchanger during relaxation of the
heart. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is thought to play minor role in the cardiac
contraction and relaxation cycle. The decreased use of the SR in calcium cycling may
explain the lower cardiac outputs and metabolic rates of fishes.
