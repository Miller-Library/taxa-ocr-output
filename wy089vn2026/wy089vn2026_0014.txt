Table I. Rate of calcium uptake in BFT fast twitch and slow twitch muscle and BFT and
yFT atrium and ventricle SR vesicles. 75 nmol of CaClz were added to BFT fast twitch
SR vesicles. The concentration of protein was 0.5 mg/ml. 15 nmol of calcium were
added to BFT slow twitch muscle and BFT and YFT atrium and ventricle SR vesicles.
The concentration of these proteins was 1.5 mg/ml. Ti/ is the amount of time required
for the SR to take up half the amount of calcium added.
