contraction and increase the contractile power of the heart. Investigation into the role of
other calcium cycling proteins may provide insight into the ability of bluefin tuna to
maintain their cardiac outputs in both cold and warm waters.
Calcium uptake assays show that bluefin white muscle SR sequesters calcium
more quickly than slow twitch or heart muscle. There are more SERCA pumps in white
muscle than red muscle. White muscle also has the SERCA 1 isoform of the pump while
red muscle and cardiac cells have the SERCA 2 isoform (Brandl et al, 1986). The white
muscle in tuna swimming muscle must contract quickly to generate the power necessary
to for tuna to swim at exceptionally high speeds. Red muscle and cardiac muscle cells,
on the other hand, contract more slowly with their smaller diameter and their high
concentration of mitochondria. Although uptake of calcium by the SR in tuna hearts is
slow, the uptake is ATP mediated, suggesting that tuna hearts use SERCA 2 as a means
of removing calcium from the cytoplasm.
Conclusions
The existence of SR in tuna cardiac cells is a factor in explaining the high cardiac
outputs and metabolic rates of tuna. Calcium cycling in the SR is crucial in determining
rates of contraction and relaxation. Tunas, the athletes of the fish world, have the ability
to coordinate the release and uptake of calcium by the SR and deliver oxygen to their
working muscles in a wide range of ambient temperatures. How tunas evolved this
extraordinary ability and the physiological mechanisms that allow them to do so is an
interesting question. The uptake of calcium by SERCA 2 hints at the paramount role of
the SR in contributing to their high metabolic rates. Further research possibilities include
an investigation of the role of other calcium cycling proteins, such as DHPR, the
