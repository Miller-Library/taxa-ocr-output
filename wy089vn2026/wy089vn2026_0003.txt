Because tuna maintain the high heart rates necessary to sustain their high cardiac
outputs and metabolic rates, I hypothesized in this study that the tuna myocyte has an
internal SR with calcium ATPase and calcium release channels. A tuna that is able to
maintain a high metabolic rate may have an increased reliance on SR calcium cycling,
which permits a higher heart rate and cardiac output. Examination of the SR in teleosts
has been done mainly on salmonids (Tibbits et al, 1991); however, little work has been
done examining calcium cycling in tunas. It has been shown that skipjack tuna heart
derives a large portion of its calcium required for contraction from the release of calcium
from intracellular SR stores (Keen et al, 1992). Moreover, rates of relaxation and
contraction in yellowfin tuna hearts have been shown to be impaired by ryanodine, a
natural plant alkaloid that blocks SR calcium release, suggesting that SR calcium plays a
role in initiating contraction (Shiels and Farrell, 1999). In this study, we examined the
presence of sarcoplasmic reticulum with calcium ATPase and calcium release channel in
two species, the yellowfin tuna and bluefin tuna.
Methods and Materials
SR isolation
Wild tunas were obtained in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans during routine
collections. Tissues were freeze clamped after the fish were caught on hook and line and
sacrificed by pithing. Additionally, tunas were maintained in captivity at the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center as described by Altrinham and Block, 1997
For purification of sarcoplasmic reticulum from the tuna hearts, between 3.5g and
30.0 g of liquid nitrogen freeze-clamped tissues from bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) or
yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) heart muscle was homogenized using a Tekmar
