to 380 nm, is high. Upon addition of ATP, the amount of calcium in the extravesicular
space decreases as the SR sequesters calcium. Upon the addition of CaCl, the amount of
calcium in the extravesicular space quickly increases and then declines back to baseline
as the SERCA 2 pumps are activated. The rates of uptake of calcium by the SR can be
calculated given the known amount of calcium added. The experiment is repeated with
bluefin and yellowfin atria and ventricles. (Fig. 6) Bluefin fast twitch muscle SR
sequesters calcium at a rate of 3.2 nmol Ca“/mg/s. Bluefin tuna slow twitch muscle SR
sequesters calcium at a slower rate of 0.094 nmol Ca“/mg/s. Bluefin atrium SR
sequesters calcium at a rate of 0.020 nmol/mg/s and bluefin ventricle SR sequesters
calcium at a rate of 0.014 nmol/mg/s. Yellowfin atrium and ventricle sequester calcium
at an identical rate of 0.012 nmol/mg/s (Table 1).
Discussion
In this study, I have shown the presence of proteins associated with the
sarcoplasmic reticulum in tuna atrial and ventricle tissues. I have examined the content
of SERCA 2 and found it slightly higher in the atrium in both tunas. The results may
indicate that the high metabolic rates of the tunas are correlated with the presence of
sarcoplasmic reticulum and the machinery for calcium cycling.
In mammalian and avian lineages, the metabolic rates require high cardiac
outputs, which are enhanced by the short diffusion distance for calcium from the internal
SR stores to the contractile filaments. This allows for an increased relaxation rate, heart
rate, cardiac output, and delivery of oxygen to the demanding muscles. In the classic
view of fish, tension generation relies primarily on extracellular calcium, thus
lengthening the diffusion distance and decreasing fish heart rates. Tunas are powerful,
