Fig 1. The heart cell. Calcium from the extracellular space enters the heart cell through a
voltage-gated channel, DHPR. This causes calcium induced calcium release by the
ryanodine receptors in the SR membrane. Tension can then be generated by the
contractile filaments. During relaxation of the heart cell, calcium is removed by plasma
membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA), the sodium-calcium exchanger, and SR calcium
ATPase (SERCA). (from Tibbits et al, 1992).
Fig 2. Purification of sarcoplasmic reticulum. A 3-12% SDS gel was loaded with
different fractions of the SR isolation preparation in YFT and BFT ventricle. The
homogenate contains the contractile filaments. Microsomes, light SR
and heavy SR fractions are enriched in SR.
Fig 3. Western blot with a SERCA 2-specific antibody. Tuna hearts express SERCA 2.
Fig. 2A indicates that BFT and YFT ventricle have SERCA 2, as evidenced by the bands
at 110 kDa. Fig. 2B indicates that YFT atrium and ventricle have SERCA 2, as
evidenced by the bands just below the 118 kDa molecular weight marker.
Fig. 4. A comparison between bluefin and yellowfin atrium and ventricle. SERCA 2
(110 kDa), myosin (200 kDa), and ryanodine receptor (576 kDa) can be
visualized on this 3-12% SDS gel. Tuna hearts have SERCA 2.
Fig 5. Calcium uptake by BFT fast twitch muscle SR. Uptake of calcium by BT fast
twitch muscle SR is ATP mediated. The amount of calcium in the extravesicular space
decreases when ATP is added and the SR sequesters calcium. When CaClÂ» is added, the
extravesicular calcium increases is followed by an immediate sequestration of calcium by
the SR.
