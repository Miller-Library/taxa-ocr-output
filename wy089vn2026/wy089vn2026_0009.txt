highly metabolic, endothermic fishes that maintain high muscle temperatures through a
wide range of ambient temperatures. The heart, at ambient temperature, somehow fulfills
the high oxygen demand of the working tuna muscle. The use of an internal specialized
structure, such as the SR, could explain how tuna maintain a cardiac output high enough
to supply oxygen to the swimming muscles.
Tuna atrium may have more SERCA 2 than ventricle. Densitometry shows that
the ratio of SERCA 2 in bluefin atrium to bluefin ventricle is 2.5 + 0.7 (n-2), which
correlates with the faster rates of calcium uptake in bluefin atrium than bluefin ventricle.
Bluefin atrium SR sequesters calcium at a rate of 0.020 nmol/mg/s and bluefin ventricle
sequesters calcium at a rate of 0.014 nmol/mg/s. Moreover, the ratio between yellowfin
atrium and ventricle is 1.5 + 0.2 (nâ€”4). The ratio between yellowfin atrium and ventricle,
which is not as high as the ratio between bluefin atrium and ventricle, is reflected in rates
of uptake; yellowfin atrium and ventricle SR sequester calcium at an identical rate of
0.012 nmol/mg/s. The calcium uptake assay may not be sensitive enough to detect
differences in rates of uptake in yellowfin heart SR.
The greater amount of SERCA 2 in tuna atrium and ventricle, and the faster rate
of uptake by the bluefin atrium than ventricle, can be explained by the roles of the
different chambers in the cardiac cycle. The atrium contracts and ejects its volume of
blood into the ventricle; the ventricle subsequently contracts and must sustain its
contraction against a load. While the ventricle must be able to sustain its contraction, the
atrium must contract and relax quickly before the ventricle contracts. The speed of
contraction of the atrium is critical during cardiac contraction whereas the force
