homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 0.3 M sucrose
and 20 mM potassium-piperazine-N, N’-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid (K-PIPES), pH 7.6,
and a protease inhibitor cocktail containing 1.0 M pepstatin A, 1.0 mM iodoacetamide,
0.1 mM phenylmethylesulfonylflouride (PMSF), 1.0 M leupeptin, 1.0 mM benzamidine,
0.1 M aprotinin, and 6.0 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The protease inhibitors were re-added to
each buffer at every step of the procedure. Äfter homogenization the slurry was
centrifuged for 20 minutes at 2600 g (4670 RPM) in a Sorval SL5OT rotor. The
supernatant was passed through two layers of cheesecloth, and the crude microsomes
pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 g (35,000 RPM) for one hour in a Beckman Ti50.2.
The pellets were resuspended in the resuspension buffer containing 0.3 M sucrose and 5
mM potassium-piperazine-N, N'-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (K-PIPES), pH 7.3. A
portion of the resulting microsome preparation was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -
80°C until use. The remaining material was layered on top of discontinuous sucrose
gradients (2.0 ml 45%, 3.0 ml 35%, 3.0 ml 25%) containing 0.4 M KCl, 0.1 mM
NazEGTA, O.1 mM CaCl, and 5.0 mM K-PIPES, pH 6.8, and centrifuged 16 hours at
23,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Heavy SR (HSR) membrane vesicles were
recovered from the 35%-45% interface and pelleted at 100,000 g. Light SR (LSR)
membrane vesicles were recovered from the 30-35% interface and pelleted at 100,000 g.
Vesicles were resuspended in 200 mM sucrose and 5.0 mM K-PIPES, pH 7.0, frozen in
liquid N», and stored at -80°C until use.
Calcium ATPase (SERCA 2) antibody production and purification
Isoform specific antibodies were raised against a peptide of SERCA 2 by
Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The peptide corresponding to amino acids
