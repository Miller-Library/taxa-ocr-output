Tunas are the athletes of the fish world. They are endothermic, maintaining high
metabolic rates that are approximately 3-5 times those of other active teleosts (Brill and
Bushnell, 1991) and more like those of small mammals (Keen et al., 1991). The anatomy
of tuna allows them to keep their swimming muscles warm. Tunas have a retia mirabilia,
a system of countercurrent heat exchangers composed of a masses of intertwined arteries
and veins that prevent heat loss and shunt metabolic heat back to the tissues (Carey.
1973). The result of increased temperature in their muscles is increased power output of
the swimming muscles. While their swimming muscles are maintained at high
temperatures, their hearts are at the ambient temperature. Tuna sustain delivery of
oxygen to their tissues though a wide range of temperatures. The thermal niche of the
more tropical yellowfin tuna is between 12° and 28° C while that of a bluefin tuna is
between 2 and 30°C (Block, pers. comm).
Tuna hearts produce high cardiac outputs to sustain delivery of oxygen to their
swimming muscles. The maximum cardiac output of yellowfin tuna is 97.6 mls/kg/min
(Blank et al, 2001) whereas the maximum cardiac output of a rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) is 17.6 ml/min/kg. (Kiceniuk and Jones, 1977). The regulation of
cardiac output in tunas has been suggested to be primarily through heart rate (Farrell et al,
1992). Tunas have heart rates that exceed 120 bpm (Farrell and Jones, 1992) and have
been measured as high as 240 bpm (Kanwisher et al,1974). The heart rates of tunas
exceed those of other lower vertebrates. A high heart rate may be a prerequisite for high
cardiac output and concommitant oxygen delivery to their powerful swimming muscles.
Calcium cycling, which is necessary tension generation in the heart, is essential to
contraction and relaxation of the heart. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is an internal store
