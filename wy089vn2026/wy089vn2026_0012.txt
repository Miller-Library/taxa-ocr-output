ryanodine receptor, and myosin ATPase, which may contribute to the high cardiac
outputs of tuna.
Acknowledgements
Towe an incredible amount of gratitude to my advisor, Barbara Block, for her
dedication and excitement about my project. I thank her for sparking my interest in
research and for contributing to my critical thinking on this project. l’ve learned a little
bit about what science is about and couldn’t have done it without her. I had never
thought as tuna as amazing organisms until I met Barb! I also am so grateful to Jeffery
Morrissette for the amount of work and time he invested in this project. I thank him for
answering all my questions and being a wonderful teacher and I could not have done this
without him. 1 want to thank Jason Blank for also being an incredible teacher and for his
willingness to drop everything to help me. I thank him for furthering my excitement
about physiology. l’ve learned so much about being in a lab, research, and science from
these two gentlemen. l’d also owe a special thanks to everyone in the Tuna Research and
Conservation Center for their wonderful help.
