Western blot
To determine if the band at 1 1OkDa was SERCA 2, a Western blot analysis was
conducted using a SERCA 2 specific primary antibody (Fig. 3). A band appears at 110
kDa in yellowfin tuna atria and ventricles and bluefin tuna ventricles, confirming the
presence of SERCA 2 in these tissues.
Densitometric comparison of bluefin and yellowfin, atrium and ventricle SERCA 2
A band at 110kDa appears in all lanes in 3-12% SDS-PAGE comparing bluefin
and yellowfin atrium and ventricle microsomal fractions (Fig. 4). A thin band at about
500 kDA also appears on the stained gels, demonstrating the existence of the ryanodine
receptor in tuna heart. Previous work has demonstrated that the molecular weight of the
fish ryanodine receptor is 576 kDa (Franck et al, 1998).
Densitometry performed on the SDS gels using NIH Image suggests that tuna
atrium has more SERCA 2 than ventricle. The ratio of SERCA 2 band intensities
between bluefin atrium and bluefin ventricle is 2.5 + 0.7 (n-2). The ratio between
yellowfin atrium and ventricle is 1.5 + 0.2 (nâ€”4). Densitometry also suggests that
yellowfin and bluefin tuna heart have similar amounts of SERCA 2. The ratio between
yellowfin atrium and bluefin atrium is 1.5 + 1.0 (n-2). The ratio between yellowfin
ventricle and bluefin ventricle is 0.9 + 0.2 (n-4).
Flourimetry
SR vesicles take up calcium when ATP is added to the cuvette containing BFT
fast twitch SR vesicles, creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, mitochondrial
inhibitors and fura 2 (Fig. 5). At t =O, ATP is absent in the cuvette and the level of
calcium in the extravesicular space, as evidenced by the ratio of fluorescence at 340 nm
