generated in the ventricle is critical. An increased amount of SERCA 2 in atrium may
permit faster uptake of calcium into the SR and faster relaxation rates.
There is not a substantial difference in the amount of SERCA 2 between bluefin
and yellowfin hearts. Densitometry shows that the ratio of yellowfin atrium and bluefin
atrium is 1.5 + 1.0 (n=2). The ratio between yellowfin ventricle and bluefin ventricle is
0.9 +0.2 (n=4). The similar amounts of SERCA 2 between the two species of tuna can
be explained by the following: Both bluefin and yellowfin tuna live in warm waters for
part of the year. This period, where muscles are warm and demand an abundance of
oxygen, sets the maximum limit of oxygen delivery to the tissues. For the heart to
deliver oxygen to warm, highly demanding swimming muscles at 30°C, both yellowfin
and bluefin tuna hearts must have high frequency contractions. Thus, both species have
the calcium cycling machinery necessary to deliver these high frequency contractions;
both species are equipped with high amounts of SERCA 2. How bluefin tuna can
maintain their high metabolic rates and high cardiac outputs to sustain their aerobic
performance necessitates fürther research. Perhaps the SERCA pumps are at a high
concentration in cold waters and are pumping just as much calcium into the SR in cold
waters as they do in warm waters. Other proteins in the calcium cycle may be
responsible for high bluefin tuna cardiac outputs through a wide range of temperatures.
Instead of increasing heart rates to maintain a high cardiac output to deliver
oxygen to their swimming muscles, perhaps bluefin tuna rely on an increased stroke
volume to supply their high cardiac outputs. This could be caused by the surface
membrane voltage gated channels (DHPR), which may let calcium into the myocyte for a
longer period of time. An increased flow of calcium into the cell would sustain the
