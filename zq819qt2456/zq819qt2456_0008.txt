The Radula Sac
The short arm of the radula sac consists of an outer epithelial layer about 7.5u
thick, a layer of connective tissue and an inner epithelial layer about 125u thick. The
ligament sac takes up a large part of the short arm. Another large portion is filled with
cells about 25u long, with basal or central nuclei. These cells have diffuse contents that
stain light blue with methylene blue (Fig. 5C), and form a thick layer that folds onto
itself. The teeth in the short arm are usually in close contact with this cell layer. Some
of the teeth are positioned in random directions, but a majority of them face with their
points towards the proboscis, and all of the teeth entering the proboscis point this way
(Fig. 5A). The space around the teeth contains a mixture of granular, cellular and
unidentifiable material, some of which appears to be similar to material in the venom
duct (Fig. 5E, F). Similar material also fills a majority of the teeth, especially those
entering the proboscis (Fig. 5A).
The teeth are enveloped by muscle as they travel through the proboscis. As the
connection forms, the sac and the proboscis are in close contact on many sides, and folds
of the proboscis wrap around the sac. The teeth enter into the proboscis tip first, and more
then one tooth in the passageway can be seen (Fig. 5A)
The long arm of the sac was studied not in detail, although individual teeth were
examined. Teeth at the blind end were less developed, and generally had less discrete
matter in their lumen than teeth from the short arm (Fig. 6).
