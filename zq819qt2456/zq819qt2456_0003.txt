holds its proboscis inside of its mouth, but when prey is sensed, through chemoreceptors
in its osphradium, (Spengler and Kohn; 1995), it extends the proboscis and begins to
search for food. When the cone finds its prey, it will sting forcefully by inserting the
tooth and injecting the venom.
The anatomy of the venom apparatus has been characterized for several species.
and there is a general model for how the venom is made and injected through the tooth
(Endean and Duchemin, 1967; Songdahl, 1973; Hinegardner, 1958, Freeman et al.,
1974). Specific peptide components of the venom are thought to be made as pro-peptides
in the posterior region of the venom duct near the muscular bulb and then undergo
posttranslational modifications to form mature venom peptides as they move down the
duct (Bingham et al. 1996). It has been hypothesized that the muscular bulb provides the
force to move the venom through the duct into the proboscis (Olivera, 1997). This idea
has been questioned, however, because the muscular bulb does not appear to be capable
of providing sufficient pressure to inject the venom (Songdahl, 1973). It is more likely
that the proboscis itself provides the force to inject the venom (Kohn, et al. 1999). The
hollow tooth is presumably held at the tip of the proboscis by a sphincter muscle, and in
some species it has been reported that the tip of the tooth can be seen before the sting
(Kohn 1956). In some cases the cone continues to hold onto the tooth after the injection
and then uses it to pull the prey into its mouth.
The main contemporary thrust of Conus research is focused on purification and
characterization of specific peptides in the venom. These efforts have primarily
employed tropical Conus species, because they are large and their venoms, especially
those of the piscivorous species, are lethal to mammals including humans (Kohn,1998).
