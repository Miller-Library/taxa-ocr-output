two mass spectrometers; a Voyager Elite and a Voyager DE STR (PE Biosystems,
Framingham, MA) equipped with delayed ion extraction. A pulsed nitrogen laser
(337nm) was used as the desorption/ionization source, and positive-ion mass spectra were
produced using both linear and reflectron mode. Mass calibration was preformed
externally using either bovine insulin (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) or a previously calibrated
spectrum obtained from Aplysia bag cells.

The Venom Duct
The venom duct is a thin convoluted tube connecting the muscular bulb and the
proboscis. Although the entire duct was not analyzed completely, it was examined in
several places as indicated in Fig. 20.
As the duct leaves the muscular bulb (Fig. 2A) it is an orange pink color, about
250u in diameter, and the wall is composed of 3 distinct layers. There is an outer
epithelium overlaying a muscular layer. A layer of relatively large cells (60u wide x 40u
tall) surrounds the lumen, which consist of some granular material as well some diffuse
non-cellular content (Fig. 2A).
About one third of the way to the proboscis the duct grows to about 375u in
diameter, changes color to creamy white, and also changes morphologically (Fig. 2B).
There is still an outer epithelium, although it is much thinner, and this covers an
extremely thin muscular layer (Fig. 2B). The cells of the inner layer are much larger,
about 75u tall and 60u wide, and are densely packed with granules of different kinds,
There is still a central lumen, and this is packed with granules. It is difficult to
