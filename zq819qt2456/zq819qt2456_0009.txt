Physiology
Contents of the venom duct and radula sac were also characterized in terms of
their neurotoxic activities. Previous work on in C. californicus has indicated the
existence of a peptide that specifically inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels in
cephalopods and not in gastropods (Bingham et al. 2000). Duct venom isolated without
any chemical extraction in the present study also inhibits sodium channel activity in squid
neurons (Fig. 7B). Fig 7A shows that both outward (top panel) and inward (middle
panel) sodium currents were inhibited by the tooth venom.
Mass Spectrometry
Results from the reflectron MALDI mass spectra, which requires more
concentrated samples and greater instrumental optimization, but provides greater
accuracy, are shown in Fig 8. Linear mode operation gave similar results, but these data
are not shown. Region 1, the most posterior region examined (level 1 in schematic of
Fig. 8), shows only one peptide, with a molecular weight of 2993-2995, that occurs
elsewhere in the duct and none that co-occur in the radula sac (Fig. 8A,B,C). Region 2
and region 3, the mid and anterior regions of the duct, have many peptides in common
(Fig. 8B,C). They also share at least three peptides with those found in the tooth (Fig.
8B,C,D).
