Abstract
Like other members of its genus, Conus californicus has a highly evolved venom
apparatus with which it injects paralyzing venom into its prey through a modified radula
tooth. Although much research is being conducted on the venom itself, relatively little is
known about the biology behind the snailâ€™s ability to inject the venom. The venom duct,
radula sac and teeth were characterized in terms of anatomy, physiology and chemistry.
The passageway between the venom duct and proboscis is a complex branching structure
lined by a unique secretory cell type. Evidence from a combination of all methods used
suggests that there are similar active peptides in the teeth as in the duct, leading to the
possibility that the teeth are pre-loaded with venom.
