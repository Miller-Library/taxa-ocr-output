The Venom Duct
The anatomy and chemistry of the venom duct of C. californicus is in general
agreement with previous studies of other Conus species (Hermitte, 1946; Endean and
Duchemin 1967; Bingham et al. 1996). The posterior or muscular bulb end of the duct
has a distinct morphology, the peptides in this region are larger than those in more
anterior regions, and is not as active physiologically. This supports the current
hypothesis that a pro-peptides in the venom is manufactured in the posterior region and
then undergo post transitional modifications as they moves towards the anterior region of
the duct (Olivera, 1997; Endean and Duchemin, 1967,)
How the venom gets from the duct where it is made to the tip of the proboscis has
not been discovered. None of the current literature describes the passageway from the
duct into the lumen of the proboscis. The most prominent feature of this region is the
appearance of cells containing granules that stained purple. These cells appear in the
wall of the duct just before it enters the proboscis and line the passageway for the venom
through the proboscis wall.
Although the purple cells appear to be secretory, the identity of the putative
product is unknown. There are several possibilities. The cells may simply secrete some
sort of mucus, which might act as a carrier for the venom flow. Another possibility is
that some enzymatic material is secreted that could activate the venom peptides. Secreted
enzymes could also possibly help break down tissue at the injection site and allows the
venom to exert its effects faster or more efficiently.
