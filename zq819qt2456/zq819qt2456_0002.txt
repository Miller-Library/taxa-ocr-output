Introduction
Snails of the genus Conus have long been of interest, both for their unusual shells
and unique predatory hunting strategies, which employ a battery of peptide neurotoxins
to paralyze their prey. A typical gastropod has a row of chitinous radular teeth that it
uses for scraping food. The cones have modified their teeth into a combination of
miniature harpoon and hypodermic needle that is used one at a time to inject venom into
the prey. Each species has a unique tooth structure with varying size, shape, and number
of barbs, and the differences in the teeth constitutes a basis for phylogenic classifications
of Conus (Kohn et al., 1999
Although there are several hundred tropical species, Conus californicus is the
only temperate species to inhabit the ocean off of the Pacific coast from the Farralone
Islands, California to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California (Hanna and Strong, 1949). C.
californicus, like all Conus species, is predatory, but it is unusually omnivorous
compared to many typical tropical species, many of which have highly specific feeding
habits (Kohn, 1966; Nybakken, 1970).
In all cones, the venom apparatus consists of a muscular bulb connected to a long,
highly convoluted venom duct (Fig.1). The teeth are made in the radula sac, which
consists of a short and long arm. The radula sac enters the proboscis slightly anterior
from the venom duct, i.e. towards the tip of the proboscis (Fig.1C). The teeth are formed
in the long arm of the radula sac, and mature teeth are thought to be stored in the short
arm until use (Marsh, 1977). The teeth of C. californicus are about 1 mm long with a
basal and an apical opening and five barbs (Kohn et al. 1999). When resting the cone
