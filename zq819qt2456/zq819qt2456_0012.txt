gap, but it is unclear whether this is real cavity or an affect of the fixation process (Fig.
4). Small channels can be seen entering into the passageway around a finger of the
proboscis lumen and it is presumed that the venom exits through these (Fig. 4
Further studies need to be done in order to better determine the nature of this
complex passageway. Nevertheless, it is clear that the passageway through the proboscis
is not a straight large diameter tube.
The Radula Sac and Teeth
The literature to date characterizes the teeth as being hollow and empty when they
are ready for insertion to prey. (Kohn, 1998; Marsh 1977). Marsh (1971) reported that
the teeth in the short arm of the radula sac for several Australian species of Conus were
free from cellular debris, and speculated that the salivary glad duct could be responsible
for this clearing. The teeth of C. californicus, however, are full of different types of
granules and cellular debris. This is true for teeth in both arms of the sac, and especially
for the teeth entering into the proboscis. The content of the teeth looks very similar to the
content of the sac outside of the teeth. In some cases, as in Fig. 5D, clusters of granules
that stain solid blue with methylene blue are found in the wall of the radula sac, and
similar individual granules inside teeth as well. These granules are similar to ones in the
venom duct. Although the exact nature of these individual granules is unknown.
similarities in their morphology suggest that they may contain similar peptides.
Two other lines of evidence support this idea. First, examination of an individual
tooth using MALDI revealed that some of its peptides were indistinguishable from those
