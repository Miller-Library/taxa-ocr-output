unambiguously visualize the border between these cells, and between these cells and the
lumen. The anterior end of the venom duct looks similar to the middle section, except it
has grown to 475u in diameter.
At the site where the venom duct enters the proboscis musculature it narrows to
125u in diameter and is lined by cells about 25u tall with large basal nuclei (Fig. 2D).
Cells with visible boundaries that contain granules can be seen, and these granules often
appear to be segregated into different types within individual cells.
In addition, a very distinct type of cell appears in this region that is filled with tiny
granules stained dark purple by methylene blue. These cells surround the duct as it
passes through the proboscis (Fig. 3-4). As the duct crosses the proboscis, the lumen
becomes very narrow, about 20u wide, and is mostly filled with small granules that do
not stain with methylene blue. Light and dark blue granules from the lumen of the duct
outside of the proboscis can be seen entering into the passageway but seem to disappear
where the lumen branches (Fig. 3D,E). The white granules continue in the channel,
however.
The passageway branches about 250u into the proboscis (Fig. 3E, F) and the two
channels cross an ambiguous area before they exit the proboscis between folds of the
epithelium that lines the proboscis lumen (Fig. 4). These epithelial cells have well
defined basal nuclei. In the area where the venom duct exits, these folds extend further
into the proboscis wall (Fig. 4B), and the epithelium appears to merge here with the
purple cell layer that comprises the wall of the venom duct. There is a central finger that
has purple cells lining both sides, and two flanking fingers where purple cells only line
the side facing the duct.
