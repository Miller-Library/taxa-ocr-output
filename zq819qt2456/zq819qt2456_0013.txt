in the venom duct. The peaks in the 3131-3133 MW range in Fig. 8, are of particular
interest. Bingham et al. (2000) have characterized a venom duct peptide of this
molecular weight that is thought to be the peptide with sodium-channel blocking activity.
Physiological tests also indicate the presence of a specific sodium-channel blocker
in material isolated from both the venom duct and the teeth (Fig. 7). Although the effect
of the tooth venom is not as strong as the duct venom samples, it nevertheless exists. The
discrepancy is probably only due to the fact that the teeth sample was extracted from 5-6
teeth with an estimated total volume of several nL, where as the venom duct sample was
prepared from a whole duct with an estimated volume of several mL. Further
experiments are needed to quantitatively compare the potency of material from the two
source
Results from this study provide strong evidence that the radula teeth of C.
californicus contain some of the same peptides as those normally found in the venom
duct. Furthermore, one of these peptides acts to inhibit sodium channel activity. These
data are thus contrary to the widely held view that the teeth are completely empty tube
and act only as a passive delivery device. Whether or not these data are relevant to other
Conus species remains to be established. It is also unclear what role the seemingly small
amounts of toxins stored in the teeth might actually play in the hunting process.
Additional studies are needed to structurally identify the peptides in the teeth, to
determine the biological activity of these peptides and to elucidate the source of these
peptides and the mean by which they are packed into the teeth.
