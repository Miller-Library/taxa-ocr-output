This study provides a description of the general anatomy of the venom apparatus
in C. californicus with the specific aim of elucidating the anatomical pathways by which
the venom and teeth enter into the proboscis. The study also examined the composition
of both the venom duct and the teeth using anatomical, physiological and chemical
means.
Material and Methods
Histology
Specimens of C. californicus were collected from Monterey Bay. Some were
kept in an aquarium with water at ambient temperature, and others were held at room
temperature. Three animals were relaxed in 2% magnesium chloride in order to dissect
out the venom apparatus. Tissue samples were immediately fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde,
80% filtered sea water and 100 mM HEPES, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and
embedded in Spurs resin. Only two of the three samples infiltrated well, and sections
0.5u to 2 u thick were cut on an ultra-microtome with glass knives, stained with
methylene blue in 0.1 N NaÃ–H, and examined on an Olympus BH-2 microscope.
Physiology
Individual teeth were manually removed from the short arm of the radula sac in
filtered seawater. They were then broken up using a hand homogenizer in 50 uL of
filtered seawater, and added to 0.2 ml of external recording solution (see below) yielding
