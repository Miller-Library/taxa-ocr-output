A final possibility is that these purple cells could be secreting a unique venomous
peptide not found elsewhere in the system. Bingham et al. (1996) suggested the
existence of such a unique peptide in milked venom samples of C. striatus, which they
felt was not the result of a posttranslational modification of a peptide in the venom duct.
The location of these purple cells puts them in a position to be the source of such
peptides. Further studies on these purple granules need to be done in order to determine
what they are secreting and what role they play in the venom apparatus.
The branching of the passageway also raises some questions. It is difficult to
follow any one branch as it travels through the proboscis, leaving a gap in the
understanding of the passagewayâ€™s structure. However, significant insight has been
gained. The passageways after branching are very small, only about 1Ou across at its
widest point, yet this appearance of the passageway lasts through more than 100u of
sections. This suggests the passage is not a cylindrical duct, but rather a flat channel that
is much bigger in one dimension than the other. How many of these channel there are is
still uncertain.
The branching also could suggest that some sorting of granules goes on in the
passageway to ensure that only mature peptides are passed into the proboscis lumen. The
venom that the snail injects is much simpler than the venom found in the duct in regards
to the number of peptides. Perhaps the complex nature of the passageway acts like a
sieve to permit sorting of venom components on a basis of granular size or some other
feature of individual peptides.
The area between the branching point of the passageway branches and the
proboscis lumen is also nebulous. In my sections a large cavity-like area appears in this
