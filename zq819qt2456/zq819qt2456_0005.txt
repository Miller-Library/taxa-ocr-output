a final concentration of 0.022 teeth per uL of solution. Venom from the duct was
manually extruded onto a piece of parafilm, mixed with 0.5 ml of external recording
solution in a 1.Sml microcentrifuge tube, homogenized by quickly vortexing for 20
seconds and heated to 95° C for 5 minutes. Äfter a brief centrifugation (4 min at 13,000
rpm), the supernatant was diluted 1:5 with external recording solution for testing activity.
Voltage dependent ionic currents were recorded form squid giant fiber lobe
neurons using conventional single-electrode, whole-cell patch clamp. Linear (i.e. not
voltage-dependent) ionic and capacity currents were removed online with a standard P/4
technique. The holding potential was-80 mV. Temperature is indicated in the legend to
Fig. 7.
External and internal pipette solutions were designed to eliminate K+ currents by
eliminating K from both solutions. The external solution was composed of 480 mM
Nacl, 10 mM CaClz, 20 mM MgCl, 20 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM Hepes at pH 8. The
internal solution was composed of 100 mM sodium glutamate, 50 mM NaF, 50 mM
Nacl, 300 mM tetramethylammonium glutamate, 10 mM NazEGTA, 25 mM
tetraethylammonium chloride, and 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.8.

The venom apparatus was dissected out and shipped to University of Illinois on
ice. Individual portions of the tissues were dissected in isotonic NaCl, and placed in
2,5dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) on a MALDI target. Mass spectra were obtained using
