I would like to thank my advisor, Chuck Baxter, for his
helpful suggestions and the loan of various equipment. and
Alan Baldridge for providing much enthusiasm and
encouragement and repeatedly pointing me in the right
direction. Thanks to John Lee, Mark Denny, and Khosrow
Lashkari for their collective attempts to explain acoustics
to me; to Marianne Reidman for her advice and the loan of
her very helpful book; and to Ken Norris and the members of
his lab for allowing me to use the Multigon. I am

sonogram equipment.
