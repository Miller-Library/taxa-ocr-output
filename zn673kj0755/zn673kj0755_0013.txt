observe at least one case of aggression and/or competition
between most of the possible combinations of rumbling roles:
between two attendants, between an attendant and rumbler.
between two rumblers, and between a rumbler and a seal not
participating in the behavior at all. While two or more
attendants never fought during bouts, they frequently fought
between bouts, though never to the extent of drawing blood.
For example, during one morning observation session I
noticed that one attendant was consistently head-thrusting
and scratching a second attendant. As the session
continued, the more aggressive attendant was frequently the
only accompanying seal.
When I returned to observe in the
atternoon, the same rumbling seal was performing and the
more aggressive attendant was still accompanying, but the
sther attendant never again appeared.
Un a separate occasion I observed a seal which
consistently had attendants. One of these attendants twice
performed a rumbling episode while the one it had been
attending was at the surface. However, this attendantÂ¬
turned-rumbler vocalized alone, while the original rumbling
seal soon returned to perform more episodes and was still
attended by the thers of the group.
Humblers were also aggressive at times. On one
occasion I observed an unattended, vocalizing seal roll onto
its stomach, look around, spot another rumbling seal about
15 teet away, and approach this second seal as if to become
an attendant. Instead it began to scratch at the thrat of
