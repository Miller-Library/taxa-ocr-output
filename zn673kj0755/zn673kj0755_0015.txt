onto his back and began swimming upside-down at a fairly
rapid pace. Occasionally as he swam he rumbled, which was
quite different from the basically stationary pattern I had
seen betore. He swam in a wide circle without surfacing or
righting himself, eventually arriving back at the original
site to which the female had returned. He righted himself
as soon as he saw her and they began playing again.
This
pattern was repeated twice, after which the male hauled out.
DISCUSSION
There is a wide variety of evidence to suggest that the
rumbling behavior is linked to mating. A somewhat similar
behavior known as ballooning is performed by a closely
related species, the spotted seal, Ehoca largha, exclusively
during its mating season (Beier and Wartzok 1979).
Ballooning is a male behavior in which the seal lies on the
bottom of the tank on his stomach and retracts his head so
that the thoracic region appears swollen. No vocalizations
appear to e associated with the behavior. However. this
same study also shows that the spotted seal des haye
underwater vocalizations which occur only during the mating
season, though Stirling (1973) found no such vocalizations
Tor the ringed seal, Fhoca hispida. Evelyn Hanggi (personal
communication), recording underwater vocalizations of harbor
seals at Foint Lobos. California, has heard only the
rumbles, and variations on them, and has found that they are
