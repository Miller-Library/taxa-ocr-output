only become a birthing area in the past few years. The site
has a granite and sand substrate predominated by Phyllospadix
and algal growth; makimum depth is approximately ap m. In an
etfort to insure that all portions of the site were surveyed
adequately, it was divided into six manageable regions.
Ihis notation also allowed me to document the approximate
location of any observed behaviors.
All observations were made while snorkeling during
daylight hours, with notes recorded on underwater paper
mounted on a plexiglass clipboard. Observations were
conducted after dark on only three pecasions for reasons of
visibility and personal safety. In addition, the seals are
reported to be night foragers and therefore absent from the
haul-out area at this time (Osborn 185). I saw no seals in
the water or on the haul-out during my night sessions.
