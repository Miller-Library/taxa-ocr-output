Diurnal patterns:
Prequency of sleep observations was related to tidal
Height, the greatest frequency occurring at mid-tide, rather
than time of day (Figure 2).
Note on pupE:
All above results reflect only the activities of seals
at least one year old; no pups were observed sleeping in
this manner. Instead, pups floated at the surface with the
back exposed and head and tail underwater. They maintained
this posture for minutes at a time and were often easily
approached while doing so.
DISCUSSION
In summary, we see that the underwater resting behavior
of harbor seals does meet the definition of sleep as
outlinedlearlier. The seals maintain a characteristic prone
Posture amongst the surf grass for up to seven minutes at a
time and, presumably during deeper stages of sleep, are not
easily aroused by the observer or other seals.
he seals were observed to sleep underwater most
frequently at mid-tide levels. This result is surprising
for two reasons: (1) it has been hypothesized that harbor
seals sleep in water as a result of being forced off the
