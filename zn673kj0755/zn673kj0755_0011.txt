sound, like a pop, followed by a low frequency rumbling roar
which lasts approximately three to five seconds. Sonograms
Ot three separate vocalizations made by two unattended seals
are very similar and show that the band of maximum energy
occurs between 150 and 200 Hz, with no harmonics (figure 4).
The seal may rumble several times while still on its
back. I will refer to each discrete period which the seal
spends on its back as one rumbling bout; therefore, the seal
may perform several vocalizations per bout. During the
vocalizations the swelling of the throat and chest
decreases, though there is not necessarily an accompanying
release of bubbles. In fact, there are generally few
bubbles, if any, released during the vocalizations.
Unce the seal completes this rumbling bout, it returns
to its upright position, briefly scans the area visually.
and then either rolls over to perform another bout in
appruximately the same location or completes the entire
rumbling episode by swimming to the surface. I define an
episode as that perind of time from the first rumbling bout
to the time when the seal either returns to the surface or
escapes my field of vision. On average a seal will perform
approximately three outs per episode( -.2
bouts/episode, range 1 to 7 bouts/episode, S.D. - 1.47
bouts/episode. n - 71). In addition, frequently the same
seal will perform a long series of episodes per obeervation
period, always returning to the same spot to vocalize.
