FORT II: RUMBLING
INTFODUCTION
Renouf and Lawson (1987) found that adult harbor seals
play socially only during the mating season, which extends
from April through June in California (Bonner 1990). Ralls
et al (1985) hypothesize that phocids are considered one of
the least vocal pinnipeds because most of their
Vocalizations occur underwater; they note that yocalization
rates are probably greatest during the mating season and
that sezually mature males are the most vocal animals. Yet
the best documented underwater activities of the harbor seal
are the clicking vocalizations thought to be associated with
echolocation (see, for example, Schevill, Watkins and Hay
1953; Renouf 1989). During my studies of underwater sleep,
I noticed a previously undescribed underwater vocalization
behavior, which I refer to as "rumbling". performed
exclusively by males and possibly associated with
reproductive behavior.
MOTERIALS AND METHODS
Vocalizations were recorded with a hydrophone and a
Sony portable recorder. Sonograms of the vocalizations were
produced on the Multigon Industries Uniscan II. Vided
recordings were made on two separate occasions using a Super
