FART I: SLEEF
INTRODUCTION
While precise definitions of sleep are difficult, the
behavior can be recognized in mammals according to four
criteria (Campbell and Tobler 1984): (1) a characteristic
posture, (2) maintained quiescence, (3) a raised threshold
Of arousal, and (4) reversibility of the behavioral state.
There is no standardized method of distinguishing between
"drowsiness" and "sleep"
Captive gray seals have been described as sleeping at
the surtace of the tank with the nostrils clear of the
water, then sinking below the surface for up to four minutes
betore rising again to breathe (Ridqway et al 1975).

Bottling and sinking underwater in the same location for 68
minutes continucusly. However, the behavior of the seal
onme it is underwater, including the four sleep criteria
previously discussed, have never been described,
