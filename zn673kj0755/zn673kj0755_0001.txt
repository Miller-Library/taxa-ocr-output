Ihis study of the underwater behavior of harbor seals
at Hopkins Marine Life Refuge comprises two papers: Fart I
considers aspects of aquatic sleep patterns, while Fart II
describes an underwater vocalization behavior, referred to
as "rumbling".
Harbor seals were found to sleep in the shallow waters
near their haul-out. In the majority of cases a seal slept
in a prone position amongst the surf grass. Sleep was most
frequently observed at mid-tide levels. Fups were obseryed
in aquatic sleep only at the water's surface.
Rumbling is a highly stereotyped behavior involving
both vocalizing seals (rumblers) and hon-vocalizing
attendants. The low-frequency vocalization is performed by
males only and in a localized portion of the study site.
Attendants, also males, participate in the behavior by
situating themselves alongside the vocalizing seal so that
their heads are in close proximity. It is suggested that
this behavior is linked to reproductive activity.
