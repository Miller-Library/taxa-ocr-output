Due to the general wariness of the animals, few
behavioral studies have focused on the underwater activities
of free-ranging harbor seals, Ehoca vitulina (see, for
example, Venables and Venables 1759; Sullivan 1781; Allen
1785: Renouf and Lawson 1787). The seals of the Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge, Facific Grove, California, have become
acclimated to human activity on shore and in the water.
While snorkeling I was able to observe patterns in
underwater sleep and also noticed a highly stereotyped
underwater vocalization behavior, hereafter referred to as
"rumbling".
MATERIOLS AND METHODS
The study was conducted from April 25 to June 4, 1990
and consisted of approimately S hours of underwater
observation. Figure I illustrates the study site, located
in the area of Hopkins Marine Life Hefuge between Ogassiz
Heach and Seal Racks. I chose this site because it is a
reasonable area to observe over the time designated for this
study and because it is immediately adjacent to pne of two
groups of racks used as a haul-out by the approkimately 100
harbor seals resident to the refuge. The zeal population
consistsof bath sexes of all age classes, though it has
