episodes, consisting of a combined total of 116 bouts.
during a one hour and forty minute period.
Rumbling behavior was observed during 15 of 25 separate
Observational sessions. On nine of these 15 occasions the
Fumbling seal was accompanied by at least one other seal
during one or more bouts. Though I could only consistently
identify four rumbling seals for the duration of the study,
it is possible that a total of up to thirty different
individuals were observed rumbling.
By my definition, an accompanying or attending seal may
assume any of a wide variety of body postures as long as the
following criterion is met: an attending seal alighs itself
alongside the vocalizing seal so that their heads are within
a tew inches of each other, if not in actual physical
contact. This posture is held only for the duration of an
individual bout; between bouts the accompanying seal often
swims away. Of the 358 bouts observed 68.47 (n-245) were
umattended, 24.97 (n=89) had one attendant, 6.17 (n=22) had
two attendants, and 0.67 (n-2) had three attendants. During
any one observational period, the members of a rumbling
behavior group remained consistent: that is, the same
Fumbling seal would have the same attending seals, though
not all of those attendants would necessarily be present at
all times. However, determining whether these groups
remained constant across
observational
periods was
difficult.
Although there was generally very little antagonism
amongst the seals involved in rumbling behavior. I did
