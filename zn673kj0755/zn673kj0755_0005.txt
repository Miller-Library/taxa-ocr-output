remained in a characteristic sleep posture for at least ten
seconds, including those animals which may have been
more
properly described as "drowsy". Occasipnally a seal would
adopt such a posture for the required time but would moye
its head alertly as if looking for something in the water:
these instances were not recorded as sleep.
RESULTS
Festure:
In 887 of all recorded observations (n=42 of 48) the
sleeping seal was lying prone on the substrate. There were
a tew cases of a seal lying on its side or back. On four
occasions a seal was observed rolling back and forth in the
surge. In all cases the body was fully extended, with the
foreflippers resting at the seal's side.
Site:
Seals were found sleeping in thick patches of
Fhyllospadix in 757 of all cases (ne of 48). The grass
provides excellent camouflage as it moves with the surge and
is swept over the seal. In about half of these gmassÂ¬
covered cases (5, n-19 of 3o) the seal was actually wedged
under something, a rock ledge or a railroad tie, which had
grass growing on or arpund it. The remainder of
observations found the seal sleeping on shorter vegetation
or on the open sandy substrate.
