I was unable to identify individuals well enough to
determine whether each seal has its own preferred, specific
site.
Arousal:
It was not uncommon for my approach to awaken a
sleeping seal. However, often times the result was merely
that the seal would open its eyes and look around slowly.
apparently not awaking completely. Frequently then the seal
would remain in place. On many occasions I was able to swim
very close to a sleeping seal without eliciting any
response. Similarly, I often observed other seals to swim
within a foot of a sleeping seal without causing any
disturbance. The average underwater sleep duration was
about 1.5 minutes (x-1.6 min., n-35, range 10 seconds to 7.3
min.).

in 527 of the total observations where the data was taken
(n-12 of 23), the seal sank rather than swam to the
substrate. This sinking from the surface to the substrate
was achieved without any discernible motion of the fore- or
hindtlippers and without releasing bubbles. The motion
appears to be consistent with previous observations of
sinking and resurfacing, mentioned earlier. Seals surfaced
for air immediately upon leaving the sleep site in 877 (n=20
