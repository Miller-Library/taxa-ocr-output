individual discrete bouts of behavior for analysis.
HESULTS
There are two possible roles played by male harbor
seals involved in rumbling behavior, both illustrated in
figure 3: the vocalizing seal and non-vocalizing
attendants. Vocalizing seals are not always attended.
The
age of the males involved is unknown, but in the majority of
observations the rumbling seal had a pronounced swelling
along the penile line, indicative of a certain degree of
sexual maturity. In addition, all but three isolated
observations occurred in an approximately 100 sg. m. region
of the study site immediately in front of one end of the
haul-out (see figure 1). The behavioral pattern seemed to be
distributed through daylight hours and not related to the
tidal cycle.
In the stereotypical pattern of rumbling behavior, as a
seal swims towards the substrate and arrives within a few
feet of the bottom, it rolls onto its back so that it reste
parallel to the substrate, upside down. Its throat and
chest region swell and its head begins to lift slightly
while the tail remains in place. Suddenly there follows a
full body contraction similar to that made by a person with
a severe cough. This motiom results in a loud burst of
