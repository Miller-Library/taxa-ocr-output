INTRODUCTION
A question of fundamental importance to the biologists that study
the intertidal zone concerns the impact of the resident and visiting
fishes on the community. Most intertidal studies are carried out while
the tide is out and thus predatory or browsing activities of fishes,
especially the nearshore forms that move in with the tide, is not generally
appreciated. Dietary studies done on tidepool and coastal species yield
some information but a focused community approach is really required to
resolve the problem.
A number of studies on the diet and abundance of nearshore fishes
of California can be found throughout the literature. Limbaugh (1955)
described the habits of the fishes found in Southern California kelp
forests. Quast (1968a-c) examined the diets and population sizes of the
kelp associated fishes found at two sites in Southern California and one
site in Baja California. Miller and Geibel (1973) researched the various
fish populations in the kelp forest off the Hopkins Marine Station, the
site of this study. Finally of importance, Feder, Turner, and Limbaugh
(1974) studied the relationship between the kelp plant Macrocystis pyrifera
and the fishes inhabiting its forest in Southern California. In
addition, there have been studies carried out on the tidepool fishes
specifically. Mitchell (1955) analyzed gut contents of tidepool fishes
on the Palos Verdes Penninsula in Southern California.
This study focused on the species in and adjacent to the intertidal.
