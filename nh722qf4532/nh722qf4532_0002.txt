these predators have upon this zone. The intertidal algal turf is a
region only periodically available to open water fishes and it thus seems
possible that a less-exploited food supply can be found there. Observations
show a large number of fish moving into the intertidal at high tide
despite often surgey, churning conditions which would seem to make it an
inhospitable environment. In addition, the large population of resident
tidepool fishes must exert a substantial predatory effect on the intertidal
algae and resident invertebrates. This study takes a habitat approach
investigating both the permanent residents and the larger invaders of
the intertidal zone to get an over-all picture of the impact of fish on
this rich algal dominated community.
