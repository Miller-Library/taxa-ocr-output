Eighty percent of all food items were from the intertidal and
seventy-five percent of the specimens had four or more different intertidal
species present in the gut. The most common foods were the crabs, found
in 100% of the stomachs, also tiny fish and shrimps were important.
The many species of intertidal algae found show their extensive intertidal
feeding. Endocladia muricata, one of the highest growing marine algae
was found in the gut of one larger specimen.
Actual feeding was never observed, but the fish was most often
seen lying motionless against the bottom presumably waiting for prey to
appear. Their mottled coloration blends extremely well with the algae-
covered rocks, an unwary potential prey invertebrate could easily oversee
this cryptic fish. During surgey periods the cabezon wedges itself
into rock crevices for protection where it can withstand the turbulance
and remain in the intertidal to feed.

Twenty-eight specimens were collected, sixteen with a dipnet and
twelve using hook and line, all were taken from tidepools. The standard
lengths ranged from 3.7 cm to 14.0 cm. This is the most abundant
tidepool fish in the study area, usually several can be found living
under any tidepool rock. The transect abundance figures are extremely
deflated because of the sculpins' small sizes, inconspicuous coloration.
and lack of movement. However, a trained eye should be able to spot
several sculpins within a square meter of sandy intertidal substrate.
Approximately 90 of their food came from the intertidal, the rest
is most likely taken as part of the drift that washes inshore. Overall,
