Two specimens of the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) were taken
very near the intertidal zone. Their guts were entirely filled with
fish remains. These fish are very prominent in the deeper kelp beds
and most likely do little feeding in the intertidal.
Two grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) were speared in the low
intertidal. Only some crab parts and polychaetes were identified from
their highly digested gut contents. This fish too is a common inhabitant
of the kelp beds and most likely has little to do with the intertidal.
One black prickleback (Kiphister atropurpureus) was caught on
hook and line from a tidepool. Its gut contained several species of
intertidal algae, some bryozoa and a Tricolia pulloides snail on an
algal frond. The diet and habitat of this fish seems very similar
to that of the monkeyface-eel, although it does not appear to be as
abundant in the study area.
One striped kelpfish (Gibbonsia metzi) was also caught by hook
and line from a tidepool crevice. Its gut contained an isopod and a
Pachycheles rudis crab. These fish were often seen hiding among the
bases of Phyllospadix and algae in very shallow water and feeding on the
invertebrates in these low intertidal forests.
