which were located on the algal fronds. This bryozoa was present in
nearly 60% of the specimens yet always in very small ammounts. In all
seven species of intertidal algae were found in the guts. Not a single
subtidal species was found implying that all of the monkeyface-eels
feeding occurs in the intertidal.
Although this species has a primarilyherbiverous diet, the specimens
were caught using mussel for bait. As the meat was dangled at the
mouth of a cave the monkeyface-eel inhabitant stuck its head out, grabbed
it, and quickly retreated to its cave
Other Fishes
Several other species were dealt with but to a much less extent
than the preceding fishes. They will be dealt with briefly.
Four specimens of the kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus),
all females, were speared in the intertidal or close by in very shallow
water. They were occasionally observed in the transect area, present
17% of the time, with an abundance of O.24 individuals.
Crabs composed a good part of their diets and in each case several
small eels and fishes had also been consumed. There were in addition.
a few intertidal species, though the sample number is very small, and
percentages could not be determined. Kelp greenlings were usually
observed swimming very close to the bottom searching for food.
Four rainbow surfperch (Hypsurus caryi) specimens were speared in
shallow water. This species was never actually observed in the intertidal.
it usually inhabits deeper water. They are also very shy fish, not
comfortable around divers, much like the pile surfperch. Their diet
consisted mostly of amphipods and isopods.
