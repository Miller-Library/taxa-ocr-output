DISCUSSION
The three surfperches examined appear to have an important impact
on the mid to low intertidal. The black and striped occupy a very
similar feeding niche while the pile surfperch differs from these two
species significantly. The bulk of the diets of the black and striped
surfperches comes from the algal turf community. By pulling off chunks,
they obtain a great deal of polychaetes, sipunculids, small gastropods,
amphipods, isopods, and tiny crabs. This procedure results in an intake
of unwanted algae and sand. It is assumed that algae is not the desired
foodstuff since most algal pieces are expelled after a mouthful is taken
and becomes part of the drift.
It is interesting to speculate on the impact this feeding method
has on the intertidal turf. Assume thirty mouthfuls are taken a day per
fish, each consisting of approximately 2 cm of turf area. Consequently,
about 60 cm" is pulled off each day by one fish. Intertidal fish density
estimates for fishes closely associated with the intertidal show
approximately one black or striped surfperch every 3-6 meters of shore
length. Imagine the extent of turf removal over a few months or even
weeks. Perhaps these fish are the gardeners limiting the growth of the
algae, their exclusion from an area may result in lush algal growth.
Invertebrate grazing upon algal fronds may have only minor impact on
the algal forest when compared to the fishes' activities.
Although the pile surfperch is often seen foraging with black and
striped surfperches within the intertidal, this species is exploiting
a quite different resource. The low presence of algae and associated
