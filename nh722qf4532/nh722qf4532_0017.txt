Large monkeyface-eel specimens often had entire blades of Iridaea
cordata and good-sized clumps of Gigartina papillata in their gut.
These large algal pieces must have been pulled off the intertidal
turf to eat. If this fish was scavenging from the drift the guts would
probably contain substantial quantities of subtidal algae species as well.
These species may be important trimmers of the intertidal algae.
Larger blades and fronds of algae are abundant and easier to obtain
than the short "well-pruned" plants.
A 30 cm monkeyface-eel could easily consume 225 cm of mature
Gigartina papillata a day. These fish are known to be territorial, often
living in a particular cave for several years. At this rate of feeding.
one of these fish would very soon deplete the nearby algae surrounding
its home. Since no unusually bare patches were observed near monkeyface-
eel caves, it is assumed that most feeding occurs away from their home,
This may be an excellent species to test for dietary sufficiency of
algae on aquarium specimens along with enzymatic studies to see if
herbivory is truly the mode of feeding in this species. The previous
suspected herbiverous species (opaleye, zebraperch, and halfmoon)
have been placed in doubt (Quast 1968b).
In closing, this study has demonstrated the significant roles
that tidepool and nearshore fishes play in intertidal ecology and has thus
established the need for further study in the field. Different environments,
seasonal variations, and diurnal cycles are among the essential elements
for follow-up investigations on the fishes of the diverse intertidal
community.
