habits of the senorita it seems to have no preference for feeding
intertidally since its nearshore abundance could provide a much higher
intertidal density than was actually observed.
The cabezon primarily comes to the intertidal to feed on crabs.
Crabs were often removed from the gut with their legs and claws all
present and neatly folded indicating that they were captured by surprise,
probably because they did not perceive the cryptic cabezon. This fish
exerts a similar effect on the intertidal crabs such as Pachygrapsus,
by invading their environment only at high tides like the pile surfperch
does to Pagurus.
The tidepool fishes inevitably occupy extremely important niches
in the food chain of the intertidal. They are the top predators for at
least half the tidal cycle. Without doubt, if the wooly sculpin was
excluded from the intertidal the entire community would change drastically
The difference in diet between large and small wooly sculpins
can be simply explained by their different mouth and body sizes. A long
slender worm would be a far more practical prey item for a young sculpir
than would a bulky crab or limpet, which are preferred by the adults.
The general small size of wooly sculpins allows them to remove invertebrates
from algae without taking large quantities of it into their stomachs.
The most important algal feeders seem to be the monkeyface-eels
and the pricklebacks. By observing the fullness of the guts it appears
that these are herbiverous organisms which require large quantities of
plant material to obtain sufficient nutrition. Although bryozoa was
frequently encountered it never seemed to be abundant enough to provide
adequate food energy to fuel these large fishes.
