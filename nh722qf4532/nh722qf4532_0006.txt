Black Surfperch
(Embiotoca jacksoni)
All eighteen specimens were collected by spear, the standard
length size range was 21.0 cm to 27.5 cm. This was one of the most
frequent visitors to the intertidal, present in 100% of the transect
observation periods. An average of three specimens were present during
each period, the adults being three or four times more common than the
juveniles
Its principal foods were polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, gastropods,
crabs, and algae, however the algae consumed was most likely incidental,
taken for the invertebrates found on its fronds. This fish definitely
feeds a great deal intertidally because 70% of all specimens had at least
three seperate intertidal species in their guts. In addition, between
sixty and seventy percent of the food items found came from the intertidal.
A great deal of its foraging seems to have occurred among Phyllospadix
blades since 75% of the specimens examined had this plant in their guts.
In the field, the black surfperch was observed nibbling at low
intertidal Phyllospadix that was encrusted with bryozoa, mouthfuls were
taken approximately every thirty seconds. Another common feeding
technique noted several times begins with the fish taking a mouthful
from the sand bottom or algal turf. It chews for a few seconds then
expells sand and bits of algae from its mouth, presumably retaining
invertebrates to swallow. In spite of the expulsion of sand from their
mouths, most of these fish had large quantities of sand in their guts.
sometimes comprising up to 90% of their entire gut material.
