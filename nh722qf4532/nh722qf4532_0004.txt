Gut Analyses
Within a week after its collection, each preserved intestinal
tract was sliced open and the partially digested food material was
examined under a dissecting microscope. Estimates were made of stomach
fullness. The food material was then identified as precisely as possible
to major group and when appropriate to genus and species, using Light
(1975) and Abbott and Hollenberg (1976) as references. Make note that
the entire gut was examined, not just the stomach, because in most cases
there was identifiable material found beyond the stomach.
Transect Fish Observation Study
A twenty meter long transect line perpendicular to the shore, was
chosen in a gently sloping area of the intertidal zone in the Hopkins
Marine Reserve. This became the site for a study on intertidal densities
and feeding habits of several fish species. The designated region included
ten meters to either side of the transect line making a total transect
area of 400 square meters stretching along twenty meters of coastline.
Twelve observational high tide dives were made in the area each one
lasting for approximately twenty minutes. A clipboard with plastic-
coated paper was used to record numbers of each species of fish observed
within the area. Notes were also taken on the foraging and feeding
behavior of the fish sighted.
