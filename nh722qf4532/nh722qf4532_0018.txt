SUMMARY
1. Studies were done on exploitation of intertidal food resources by
resident intertidal species and inshore movement of the nearshore
fishes. Presence of intertidal food items in the gut contents of
several nearshore fishes suggest extensive feeding occurs in the
intertidal during high tides.
2. Gut content analyses of tidepool fishes implies that most if not all
of their feeding occurs intertidally. Wooly sculpins were the most
common tidepool species and consumed a wide variety of food items.
The monkeyface-eel appears to be herbiverous and consumes large
quantities of intertidal algae.
Observations and gut content examinations of the black and striped
surfperches show they obtain tiny invertebrate food items by picking
off the algal turf.
The pile surfperch concentrates its diet on large visible food items,
primarily hermit crabs and gastropods.
The feeding activities of the black and striped surfperches and the
monkeyface-eel result in tearing and trimming of the algal turf and
thus have substantial impact on the intertidal community.
