turf invertebrates indicates the pile surfperch is not foraging on the
algal turf. Instead it appears to be a selective visual feeder on larger
snails and hermit crabs. Sandy and bare rocky substrates are favorite
feeding locations. Hermit crabs were found both in and out of shells
along with an abundance of broken shell pieces in the gut which indicates
their ability to crack shells in their mouths and throats, Quast (1968c).
The impact the pile surfperch has upon the intertidal zone differs
significantly from that of the black and striped surfperches, since its
feeding does not involve incidental algal pruning. The pile surfperch
is definitely an important predator of the tidepool-inhabiting hermit
crabs. Larger hermit crabs in tidepools have little to fear because
of their size and protective shell. However, once the tide comes in these
fish predators appear, forcing the hermits to take cover. This may be
a primary reason why the hermit crabs often come up with the tide to
inhabit the shallowest, most protected water possible, Prohaska (1979).
The senorita does not directly affect the intertidal as much as
the surfperches do, however its scavenging carries over into this
zone at high tides. This species avoids fast-moving, large prey items,
and is described as a picker on small, slow, or immobile forms. Bryozoa
occurred most frequently in its diet in this study. The high occurence
of fish remains may come from scavenging activity or feeding on the smaller
juvenile rockfish. The most practical method of feeding for this species
with its tiny mouth is to pick at their food material working over
bottom and algal substrate. This fish is even known to feed on zooplankton.
