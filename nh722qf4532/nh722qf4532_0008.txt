or (Paguridae), this significantly differs from the foods of the black
and striped surfperches. Approximately sixty percent of their food
came from the intertidal and ten of eleven specimens had at least one
intertidal food item. This species also has the typical perch mouth
but with teeth slightly sharper than the black or striped surfperches.
This fish was never observed nibbling from the algal turf, instead
it often hovered over sandy areas. A favorite hideaway while not in the
intertidal is underneath the kelp canopy where schools often aggregate.
Kelp Rockfish
(Sebastes atrovirens)
Nine specimens were collected by spear, the size range of standard
lengths was 20.5 cm to 30.0 cm. The kelp rockfish was never observed
in the intertidal transect area, however it commonly was found in very
shallow water of nearby locations.
Interestingly, nearly 60% of the fish taken had empty stomachs, and
none had over 20% of their guts filled. The principal identifiable
foods were tiny fish, gastropods, and shrimps. Quast (1968c) also noted
this high percentage of empty stomachs and speculated that perhaps
they were suffering from malnutrition. Larson (1972) instead proposed
that their diet of primarily soft-bodied organisms passes through the
gut very quickly so that there is little accumulation.
This species was most often seen swimming very close to the bottom.
On occasions they were found hovering vertically head-down near a shallow
water kelp plant, appearing much like a kelp blade.
