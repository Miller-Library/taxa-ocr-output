they consumed a wide variety of foods, dominated by crabs, gastropods,
and polychaetes. However, there was significant difference between the
foods of the small and large members of the species. The small fish
ate far more polychaetes and isopods than the larger fish. The large
fish in turn, consumed many more crabs and limpets. In fact, 80% of
the large specimens had one or more of the limpets Collisella scabra
and Collisella digitalis in their guts while not a single specimen
under 9.9 cm standard length had recently eaten a limpet. Their rows
of fine, sharp teeth and strong fleshy jaws are apparently well designed
to remove these limpets from rocks.
Wooly sculpins are speedy swimmers, and use this to their advantage
in their technique of feeding. They too lie motionless, camoflauged
against the bottom waiting for prey to appear, once they spot their
victim they dart out and grab it before the crab or worm knows what has
happened, this procedure was noted on several occasions.
(Cebidichthys violaceus
Monkeyface-ee
Seven specimens were collected by hook and line, one was captured
using a dipnet, all were found in tidepools, under rocks, or in caves.
The standard lengths covered the widest range of any fish studied, from
12.0 cm to 37.0 cm. Quantitative transect abundance studies were very
difficult to perform since this fish is rarely visible in the open
water, at most a head may be seen hanging beneath a rock. The frequency
of capture by hook and line however, suggest its great abundance in pools,
The monkeyface-eel has a very unique diet, consisting almost
entirely of algae. The only animals present were bryozoan colonies
