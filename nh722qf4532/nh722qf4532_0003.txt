MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of Specimens
The period of collection for specimens to be used in gut analyses
lasted from April 23 to May 28, 1979. All fish were taken from very
shallow water (eight feet or less) between the Monterey Cannery and
the northwest corner of the Hopkins Marine Reserve (see Figure 1 for
collection sites). Three methods of collection were employed. The larger
fish, those not left in tidepools at low tide were speared while skin
diving using a pole spear. Spearing was an ideal method of collection
because fish could be taken directly from either the intertidal zone
or from water very near shore at low tide. Care was applied in not
depleting any population from a particular area.
The larger tidepool fishes were taken by poke-pole fishing. A ten-
inch monofilament leader with a number 6 or 8 size hook was attached to
the end of a fishing rod, mussel was used for bait. By dangling the
baited hook into crevices and between rocks reasonably large fish were
captured from pools at low tide. Smaller tidepool fish were collected
with a twelve-inch diameter dipnet. Catching the quick-moving sculpins
was often difficult unless they were in a shallow pool.
Following collections, the fish identifications were made with
references to Miller and Lea (1972), Gotshall (1977), Bolin (1975).
Fitch and Lavenberg (1975). Bane (1971), and Roedel (1953). Then the
entire intestinal tract of each fish was removed and preserved in 85%
isopropyl alcohol.
