(Oxyjulis californica)
Sennorita
Sixteen specimens were collected by spear with a standard length
size range of 14.0 cm to 19.6 cm. The senorita is an extremely abundant
fish in shallow waters and commonly enters the intertidal. It was observed
in 75% of the transect observation periods, averaging 2.9 fish at a time
within the 20 x 20 meter intertidal transect area.
Its diet consisted of bryozoa, algae, fish and in smaller quantities
gastropods, isopods, and shrimps. Roughly one-half of the food found in
the gut was found intertidally, there was also a very high sand content.
The teeth on this fish are tiny but very sharp and the mouth projects
forward from their pointed snout.
These fish were often seen picking at algae and the sand bottom,
a well known habit of the senorita. Limbaugh (1955) says they "feed on
most any animal protein, continually picking at small objects on the
bottom, on plants, other fishes, or from the water itself." Once in the
field, a senorita was seen that picked up a Tegula funebralis snail,
dropped it, picked up another one and swam off with it.
(Scorpaenichthys marmoratus)
Cabezon
Five specimens were collected by spear and three by hook and line,
standard lengths ranged from 14.2 cm to 30.0 cm. The cabezon was found
both in tidepools and subtidally, entering the intertidal at high tides.
It was observed in the 20 x 20 meter quadrat only 42% of the time.
averaging 0.5 individuals per time period. Juveniles were far more common
than adults, however, several large fish up to 40 cm in length were found
in very shallow intertidal water.
