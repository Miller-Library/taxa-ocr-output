(Embiotoca lateralis)
Striped Surfperch
All sixteen specimens were taken by spear, the standard length
range was 21.0 cm to 29.0 cm. The striped surfperch was observed in
83% of the transect observations, averaging 2.5 fish per time period,
juveniles were rarely encountered.
Polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, gastropods, crabs, and algae
dominated their diet as in the black surfperch. Between seventy and eighty
percent of their food came from the intertidal. Furthermore, 57% of
the specimens had three or more intertidal species of invertebrates
or algae in their guts. The mouth structure is very much like that of
the black surfperch with short, stubby teeth.
The sane feeding behavior employed by the black surfperch of spitting
out sand was noted in the striped surfperch, except that the quantity
of sand expelled seemed to be noticeably less. Often the striped surfperch
was observed foraging side by side with the black surfperch and the
pile surfperch in the intertidal.
Pile Surfperch
(Damalichthys vacca)
The eleven specimens were collected by spear, their standard
length size range was from 12.5 cm to 29.5 cm. The pile surfperch
was always found in the intertidal, appearing 100% of the days of the
transect study in an average number of 3.3 fish per time period,
juveniles composed one-fourth of this number. It was however, the
shyest member of this family and usually left the area immediately as I
entered the site, so this figure may actually be substantially larger.
The diet was composed primarily of gastropods and hermit crabs
