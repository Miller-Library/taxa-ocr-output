INTRODUCTION
Although chitons are abundant along California shores,
studies of their food and feeding have been limited largely
to species of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mopalia : Exact'>Mopalia</span> (e.g. Barnawell, 1960; Boolootian, 1964).

examine the diet of the chiton <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyanoplax hartwegii : Exact'>Cyanoplax hartwegii</span> (Carpenter,
1855) in different habitats. I also include a few notes on
the slit formula of the plates of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. hartwegii.</span>
Intertidal Habitats of Cyanoplax hartwegii.
Cyanoplax hartwegii on the Monterey Peninsula, California,
is found in the mid and upper intertidal zones. Three
general habitats where large numbers of C. hartwegii were
present were studied.
First, at approximately the +2.0 ft. tide level, C.
hartwegii was most common underneath the brown alga <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia fastigiata : Exact'>Pelvetia
fastigiata</span> (J. G. Agardh) DeToni on otherwise nearly bare
rock in an area of low wave action. Here <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia : Exact'>Pelvetia</span> covered
approximately 70% of the rock area, providing a shady and
moist environment even during daylight hours and at low tide.
Because of shading by algae and by other rocks, only about 5%
of the rock was exposed to sunlight at low tide. Pelvetia
was by far the dominant alga; small amounts of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia occidentalis : Exact'>Hildenbrandia

using Smith (1944) and were verified by Dr. I. A. Abbott.
The digestive diverticulum was not extensively examined since
several dissections yielded only blue green algae and yeast
cells.
Specimens of Cyanoplax hartwegii were identified as
such on the basis of size, color, shape, insertion plate
slit formula, and comparison with museum specimens of C.
hartwegii and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyanoplax dentiens : Exact'>Cyanoplax dentiens</span> (Gould, 1846) identified by
Allyn G. Smith and kindly provided by the California Academy
of Sciences. Average insertion plate slit formulas (11-1-11
for C. hartwegii, 11-1-10 for <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dentiens)</span> proved unreliable
for identification. In specimens conforming to C. hartwegii
in all other respects, numbers of slits ranged 9-12 in the
head valve and 8-11 in the tail valve (Fig. 1). The formula
11-1-10 occurred most often, which is the slit formula
given for C. dentiens.
SSULTS
The results of the gut content analyses of 65 Cyanoplax
hartwegii from the various habitats are shown in Figures 2
and 3.
Since <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pelvetia : PartialExact'>Pelvetia made</span> up 70% of the plant cover of the
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pelvetia : PartialExact'>Pelvetia habitat,</span> it is not surprising that the 18 Cyanoplax
hartwegii taken here ate large amounts of this alga. Pelvetia
occurred in 89% of the digestive tracts and comprised the bulk

of the material in each individual. Hildenbrandia occidentalis,
and Petrocelis franciscana were found in much smaller
quantities in many individuals.
In the crevice habitat where Pelvetia was absent,
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Cyanoplax hartwegii : PartialExact'>Cyanoplax hartwegii ate</span> moderate amounts of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia : Exact'>Hildenbrandia,</span>
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Petrocelis : Exact'>Petrocelis,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endocladia : Exact'>Endocladia,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cladophora : Exact'>Cladophora</span> spp. The relative
quantities of these algae in the digestive system varied in
the 17 individuals examined, but for the population as a whole
they occurred in roughly equal amounts in the total gut content.
In the tidepool habitat the 30 Cyanoplax hartwegii
examined displayed a more varied diet. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina leptorhynchos : Exact'>Gigartina leptorhynchos</span>
appeared in many <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Cyanoplax : PartialExact'>Cyanoplax here,</span> but many other algae were
present in small quantities, including crustose corallines.
Even when <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina : Exact'>Gigartina</span> and crustose corallines were present in
the Pelvetia habitat and crevice habitat, they were not eaten.
Thus, it would appear that there is a preference for Pelvetia,
Hildenbrandia, Petrocelis, Endocladia, and Cladophora spp.
when these are present.
In the gut of C. hartwegii, larger algal species (e.g.
Pelvetia) and encrusting algae (e.g..Hildenbrandia) appear
in very small pieces indicating feeding by rasping. However,
algae with slender branches or highly dissected blades (e.g.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endocladia muricata : Exact'>Endocladia muricata,</span> Gigartina leftorhynchos) appear in the
gut much larger pieces, reminiscent of algal fragments found

SUMMARY
1. Stomach contents were examined in 65 specimens of Cyanoplax
hartwegii taken from three different intertidal microhabitats
near Monterey, California.
2. In the Pelvetia bed habitat, Pelvetia made up 80% of the
total diet, while in the higher crevice habitat, the algae
Hildenbrandia, Endocladia, Petrocelis, and Cladophora spp.
comprised 90% of the diet and were eaten in relatively
equal amounts.
3. In the high tidepool habitat, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. hartwegii ate</span> a much
wider variety of algae.
Gigartina and Hildenbradia together
made up 40% of the diet. Crustose corallines and Gigartina
occurred in all habitats examined, but were eaten by Cyanoplax
only in the tidepools.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Isabella A.
Abbott for technical help in all aspects of the gut content
analysis and identification of algae. My appreciation cannot
be measured. Her guidance in all areas of the study, and her
insight and beauty as a sincere, warm human being made my time
at Hopkins Marine Station an experience I will never forget.
