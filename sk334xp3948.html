THE VICINITY OE A SEWAGE OUTFALL
AT CARMEL, CALIFORNIA
Introduction
For years, the standard method for an assay of
pollution has been a test for the presence of coliform
bacteria, under the assumption that these indicate the
presence of other, more harmful bacteria. While this
test may be useful from a public health viewpoint, it
fails to indicate the presence of sewage itself, which
these studies show, may contain more materials harmful
to the environment than coliform bacteria themselves.
An ideal test or "indicator" of pollution should meet
two criteria:be obtainable at all types of outfall areas
and be repeatable. The coliform test conforms to the
first, but is variable on repetition. This paper will
suggest a new type of indicator, that of varying algal
distribution around an intertidal outfall area, as a
helpful measure of the extent of total pollution. It
must be emphasized that this is a correlational study,
and that to be entirely accurate, further field and
laboratory tests would have to be run on the algae in
question to verify that it is the effluent that is re
sponsible for the distributional differences.
Douglas Grey
Comparitively little has been done concerning the
distribution of marine algae, especially around an outfall
Doty (1949) summarized the tidal effects on algal vertical
distribution and did some work in the Carmel area, before
the present outfall was built. His work, however, includes
only conspicuous genera and covered such a wide range of
coastline that this could not be used as a control. Ricketts
and Calvin (1939) give transects in much more detail, but do
not cover polluted areas that surround an outfall.
The Carmel outfall, Carmel, California was chosen as
the sample study area. It is situated on a rocky point
just south of the Carmel River mouth and about one mile
north of Point <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lobos : Exact'>Lobos</span> State Park. There are rocky inter-
tidal areas (see fig. 1) within 1000 yards to the north
and most of the way to Point Lobos to the south. There
was an ideal gradient of natural population densities
of marine algae.
Mapping and Current Studies
In thepreliminary tests, I was one of a group of five
students at Hopkins Marine Station studying the Carmel
putfall area. The initial research, that of mapping the
area around the outfall and studies of ocean currents in
the Carmel Bay, was a necessary prerequisite to all of
our individual projects. Using a measured line and compass
the immediate outfall area was mapped (fig.2) showing in
detail, rocks, tidepools, etc., 150 feet to either side
Douglas Grey
of the outfall pipe. A map (fig. 1) of a larger area was
obtained from the California State Department of Parks and
Recreation which showed the area from Mission Point (approx.
2000 feet north of the outfall) to Point Lobos (approx, one
mile south of the outfall).
Following this mapping, an extensive current study was
done of Carmel Bay south of the Carmel River. Both fluor¬
escein dye packets and 12 plastic bottles filled with fresh
water were used for each run. The dye packets were helpful
around the immediate area and the bottles were more useful
for the offshore currents. The dye packets were thrown into
the water and followed up to 1/2 hour, while the bottles
were dropped in a pre-determined pattern and sighted from
several reference points at 15 to 30 minute intervals. The
bottles were recovered after two to three days, if possible.
Figures 3A-E give the results of the current studies.
Around the outfall, there is a general flow towards the
beach, which then turns north, circles back toward the
ocean, and then heads directly south. The offshore currents
go directly south and gyre offshore from Monastery Beach.
ur current studies showed that the effluent missed the
rocks just south of the pipe, going far enough offshore,
but being carried back into shore by the gyre. This was
verified by the results of our chemical tests, this
station giving consistently lower concentrations of the
effluent constituents than stations further south, The
recovery percentages were 33% for the first current study
and 58% for the second.

Chemical Analyses
Chemical analyses of the effluent at selected
stations around the outfall area (fig. 4) were then
made for later comparison to the algal distributional
studies. Tests were made for eight parameters. Micro
gram-atom concentrations per liter were calculated for
phosphates, nitrites, and nitrates by standard methods
(Strickland and Parsons) as well as milliliters of
dissolved oxygen per liter using Winkler titration
(Strickland and Parsons). Salinity was measured with
a refractometer, and hydrogen sulfide and chlorine
were determined by iodine generation and thiosulfate
titration with a starch endpoint. Temperature was meas
ured with a standard centigrade thermometer.
The results ofthe chemical tests are summarized in
figures 5-8. The first station "A" is at the sewage plant
itself, and, after that, the stations correspond to the
geography, going from Mission Point at the north, through
the outfall area, and down to Point Lobos to the south.
The concentrations obtained through the tests verified
the direction of currents as studied. The values of
nitrites, phosphates, hydrogen sulfide, and chlorine
were all at their highest values at the plant, and show
gradual dilutions going south, with apparently no effluent
going to the north.
Douglas Grey
There were differences in the rates of dilution
of the constituents, phosphate and salinity diluting
the fastest, while nitrite and chlorine residues were
detectable in measurable quantities at North Point
Lobos. The nitrite given off by the outfall is oxidized
to nitrate, and these describe reciprocal curves on the
graphs. As previously stated, the low values at station
E, just south of the outfall, are explained by the cur-
rent pattern, showing the effluent missing the station.
Algal Distribution
Marine algal distribution was studied both quali
tatively and quantitatively. The qualitative aspect
was studied through the use of transects, imaginary
Lines running from the highest growth of marine algae to
mean lower low water. All algae within 1/2 ft. on either
side of these lines were noted on a cross-sectional map
of the rocky intertidal area being studied. If an alga
looked unhealthy, this too was noted. Transects (fig.9)
were taken both north and south of the outfall area,
ranging from Mission Point to Point Lobos.
The quantitative distributions were obtained using
wooden squares 1/2 meter on a side, the area studied
each time being 1/4 meter2. All marine algae within
the square were noted and again, if there was a definite
structural injury to the plant, this was also noted.
Douglas Grey
The selection of these distributional squares was not
random. Areas of five "characteristic types" (described
below) were chosen at each of eight transect stations
(excluding 3 and 5):
3-4 feet above mean lower low water
horizontal
inshore
direct sun
2-3 feet above mean lower low water
vertical
not facing waves
2-3 feet above mean lower low water

facing waves
inshore
3-4 feet above mean lower low water
horizontal

Wost algae were identified in the field, but some
were taken into the lab and identified there.
The data from the transects are contained in fig.10A-J
The cross-sectional map appears at the top, the species
found are listed on the left margin, and their approxi
mate area of occurrence indicated with either half or a
full bar, relative to subjective population count.
Figure 11 shows the distribution of algae in these
transects and is a summary. A bar is placed in the appro
priate transect column showing occurrence. The length of
the bar is proportional to the population present in the
275
Douglas Grey
transect. The species are arranged with the species
occurring furthest away from the outfall listed first
and those occurring mainly at the outfall listed last
The empty bars indicate noticeable physical damage to
the algae, e.g., little side-branching, dryness, or
stunted growth.
The transects provide useful information concerning
the presence and qualitative abundance of marine algae
at various transect locations. These have an advantage
over the distributional squares because they cover a much
larger area and provide a more general idea of algal
distribution around an outfall area relative to tidal
height and wave exposure. Their primary value is contained
in their summary
The "V-shape" of the summary table in figure 11 in
dicates varying tolerance of marine algae to the effluent.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Codium fragile : Exact'>Codium fragile,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gastroclonium coulteri : Exact'>Gastroclonium coulteri,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Postelsia palmaeformis : Exact'>Postelsia
palmaeformis</span> all appear in transects at a great distance
from the outfall. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia occidentalis : Exact'>Hildenbrandia occidentalis,</span> on the
other hand, appears in every transect, being extremely
dense at the outfall area. The algae listed between
these exhibit a gradient of resistance between algae
like <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Codium : Exact'>Codium</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia : Exact'>Hildenbrandia,</span> suggesting the hypothesis
that marine algae do have varying resistances to effluent
constituents, ranging from the type of alga affected at
ven small concentrations of effluent (which may be cal
Douglas Grey
culated from the results of the chemical tests) to
others which may withstand that same concentration of
effluent.
Tables 12 A-E show the results of the distribu
tional squares. Each species is followed through one
of the five types of locations, plotting the area
covered versus the distance from the outfall. The para
meter of area covered is assumed to be equivalent to the
suitability of the environment to growth of the alga.
These should quantify what was hypothesized by figure 11
and should give evidence supporting the use of certain
types of algae as indicators. These tables contain only
algae whose gradients seem significant. The entire list
of species appears in the appendix.
Concerning the individual species, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina : Exact'>Gigartina</span> canal
iculata, appears to be the most sensitive to any concen¬
tration of effluent, since it occurs only on the seaward
side of Point Lobos. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Leathesia difformis : Exact'>Leathesia difformis</span> and Postelsia
palmaeformis exhibits slightly higher tolerance, their
first appearance still 4000 feet south of the outfall.
Both <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina canaliculata : Exact'>Gigartina canaliculata</span> and Leathesia difformis are
common throughout the Monterey area. Both the articulated
and crustose corallines show a tremendous gradient (fig.12 B).
Mission Point, one of the control areas, shows crustose
coralline covering an area of over 2000 cm. This value
drops to zero behind the outfall and again rises to over
1600 cm2 at South Point Lobos, the seaward transect.
Douglas Grey
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gelidium : Exact'>Gelidium</span> spp.in three of the five population distributions
showed a similar gradient.
Hildenbrandia occidentalis shows a reverse gradient
(fig. 12 B) going from a control value below 100 cm, up
to 2250 cm in an area near the butfall, and back doun to
80 cm? in the control area on the opposite of the pipe.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porphyra lanceolata : Exact'>Porphyra lanceolata</span> shows this same gradient, but not
with the same dramatic figures.
The distributional squares show a correlation between
distance from the outfall and total number of species in
the square. (fig. 13) There exists a direct relationship,
i.e., few species close to the outfall and more species
as the distance increases. The exception to this, distri¬
bution type V in figure 12 E could be explained by the
higher intertidal organisms having less direct exposure
to the effluent. Organisms living closer to the lower
low water level are more constantly washed by effluent.
One correlation for further investigation is that
between the chemical concentrations found at various
locations and the algal distribution in those same
areas. If one could begin his tests on the effects of
algal viability of the effluent at the next higher
concentrations than was detected at the area where an
alga first occurred in the distributions, it might be
possible to ascertain exactly what constituent or con-
stituents are limiting its environment and at what
concentrations.
Douglas Gre
As for the use of any of these types of algae as
indicators, much more research would have to be done,
at different outfalls, under different conditions, and
over longer periods of time. The algal distributions
presented here do exhibit gradients which might imply
their use as indicators. The corallines, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endocladia muricata : Exact'>Endocladia

<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Egregia menziesii : Exact'>Egregia menziesii,</span> Hildenbrandia occidentalis, and
Porphyra lanceolata all show signs of being possible
candidates for indicators of damage, but this study was
of only one outfall. To formulate conclusions, more
work must be done.
Douglas Grey
Conclusion
Both the current studies and the chemical studies
verified that the effluent is traveling south, along
the coast. There are measureable amounts of some com¬
ponents of effluent up to 4000 feet to the south of the
outfall. There is a difference in the rates of dilution
between constituents, this unexplained.
The algal distributions show effects up to that same
4000 feet to the south, with some algae appearing only
utside this distance (Gigartina canaliculata). The algae
show varying tolerances to the effluent, appearing at
different distances from the outfall, corresponding to
different concentrations of effluent. Indicator algae
must be verified at different locations, but this will
be a start. Concerning the Carmel outfall, this dis-
tributional study with additional studies will provide
a baseline measure of change through time.
Douglas Grey
Summary
Both transects and distributional squares may be used
to ascertain algal distribution.
Marine algal distribution around an outfall area shows
2.
distinct variations, dependent on the direction of
effluent flow.
There exists a varying resistance to the effluent in
different species, and within the same species.
The gradients shown by species of algae may lend them¬
selves to use as pollution indicators, but more work
must be done to minimize the variables of this study.
