this time lobserved and recorded behavior of the fish in pool 3 as the water both
filled and drained the area.
t e
On 11 days, from May 22 to June 4,1 snorkeled at a high tide height of 1.2 to
1.3 mrelatwe to mean lower low water so that ! could reach my hand into the pools
and accurately assess If Individuals were present or not. After pools were thoroughly
checked, lobserved the area between the tidepools and the outside area up to 1
meter In permeter and recorded presence of fish and behavlor. Distance from
original pool of capture was estimated using a waterproof slate which was 15 cm in
length (See Appendix 3).
RESULTS:
Low Tide Observations:
The population of tagged individuals generally declined over the course of
the study perlod as is reflected in Figure 3, with a maximum number of 17 on the first
day that all pools were sampled to 8 on the last day of observations. Individual pools
tended to vary in their decline, with pools i and 4 maintaining the same population
as the frst day observed.
Fidely
Fidelity to the tidepool of firstrelease is shown in Table 1. Out of the 31 tota
number of fish tagged, 21 individuals were observed for 4 days or more and were
Included in the fidelity calculation. Ofthe 21 fish, only 3 were found to have a 50% or
