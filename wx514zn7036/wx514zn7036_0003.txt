MATERIALS AND METHODS:
STUDY STTE:
Field work was conducted in an area of protected rocky intertidal at Hopkins
Marine Station, Callfornia (Figure 1). The experimental study site consisted of 5
tidepools of varying dimensions In covering an approximately 4 X 4 m square area
(Figure 2). Pool number 6 indicated on the map was not sampled but was only
observed for the presence of tagged indlviduals. The pools varled in physlcal
dimension and topographical characteristics, and height ranged from +0.62 m to
41.08 m relative to mean lower low water. These pools proved to be particularh
suitable for my study because of the abundance of  n relative to
other cottid specles. In addition, all of the pools that were sampled were free of large
cracks and crevices in which the experimental fish could possibly hide, so that on
each experimental date my low tide counts of individuals were accurate and
complete. Dimensions and characteristics of each of the pools are presented in
Appendix 1.
CAPTURE, TAGGING, AND RELEASE:
All pools were cleared of fish on the low tide before dally observations began,
and on each lowtide observation Icaught and tagged all new fish present. Because
each tidepool was small enough to capture the fish using onty a dip net and my
hand, I did not need to use anesthetic in my capturing technique, thus minimizing
disturbance to both the fish and the pool itself. Individuals were brought back to the
lab, and tagging occurred within several hours after capture. The fish were briefly
anesthetized with 2 drops of 202 Oulnaldine diluted in isopropyl alcohol in
approximately 250 ml of sea water to determine length and specles. Loose
following a similar method suggested by Willlams (1957) and Green (1971), tagged
