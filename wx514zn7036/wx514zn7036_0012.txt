their pools. Observations made at times of tidal moyement in and out of the area
elucldates aspects of the behavior of the cottids as their small world is suddenty
expanded to a vast subtidal terrain. At these tansitory times, l observed the fish
closely following the surface of the water, as if they were waiting until the very last
moment when they could either exit the pool or enter it, and they were prepared to
cope with both the forces of the waves and the possibility that they would get
stranded without water for a short period of time In return for the possible benefits
they recelved from reduced predation risk, feeding andlor engagement other
unknown activities. I larger cottids Inhabit the tidepools and perhaps take advantage
of their benefits at high tide because their own size prevents them from surviving
there at low tide, it could be that the smaller cottids equally participate in a
downward vertical shit to explolt the resources that can be galned there without
competition or predation from larger fish.
Although littie is known about the behavior of Chxxxtus ana at high tide
and the reasons for frequent movement of individuals over long distances, t ls clear
that these fish do not stay in their original tidepools at high tide and are particularly
good enough homers to find a specific tidepool again at low tide and reside in it on a
farrly regular schedule. These results, therefore, support an alternate definition of
homing in htus anai for its behavior does not seem to fit elther a pattern of
faithful homing or exploitation of any of a set of pools in a home range. Instead,
Clixttus anats may alternate between onty one or to pools in an area that it
considers its "home", and may reside there until the need for resources causes it to
temporarily leave the area and return at a later time. Fidelity to these pools may alse
be important in partitioning the resources of small refuge pools without overloading
them. Much additional work needs to be done in the area of possible navigational
ability and mechanisms of homing, however, and future observations of individuals
during the tidal change may prove to be useful in elucidating much of the behavior of
chxus anis that remains unknown.
