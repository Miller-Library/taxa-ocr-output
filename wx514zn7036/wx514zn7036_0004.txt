Individuals of each pool using 1 or 2 colored embroidery beads of unique
combinations sewed midway into the caudal musculature just posterior to the second
dorsal fin. Becovery from the anesthetic occurred within minutes after the fish was
returned to fresh sea water. Individuals were kept in aquaria until the next low tide te
allowtime for acclimation to the beads before releasing them back into their pool of
capture. When released, all fish showed normal swimming behavior and appropriate
color change to their surroundings, so l assumed the effects of Quinaldine and
tagging to be minimal. To test my tagging method, Ibeaded 10 fish and kept them in
aquaria for 22 days. During this time perlod, onty 1 fish lost its beads due to
inadequate knotting, and this happened on the 15th day of observation. Feeding
behavior and swimming motions did not at all seem to be altered by the tagging
technique. During the course of my tidepool observations, however, recovered
many individuals that had a large tear in their caudal muscle, indicating that these
were previously tagged individuals that had apparently lost their beads. In these
instances 1 noted the length of the fish and retagged the individual anterior to the
previous tag. In addition, Iperformed fin clips on the one or both of the pectoral fins
in unique combinations to aid in the identification of individuals when beads were
lost. On several occaslons found a fish that had already been tagged twice, and
retagged the fish a third time in the dorsal musculature. In previous studies that
followed fish over a substantial period of time, data on individuals was severel
limited because tag loss was substantial. However, my sample size was a suitable
number to use the length of the fish in combination with the day in which it was
caught to identify those fish that had lost their tags and retag them. A total of 31 fish
were tagged over 15 days of observation from May 18 to June 4.
