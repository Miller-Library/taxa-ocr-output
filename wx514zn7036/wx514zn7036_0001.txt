ABSTRACT:
Daily movement patterns of and pool fidelity in the intertidal fish
anzis was determined. Individuals showed a high degree of fidelity to a specific
tidepool and the majority appeared in their pools on an every day or every other daÂ¬
basis. However, almost 25% of the time the cottids sheltered at some unknown
location at low tide. I was also found that individuals of this species do not stay in
their tidepools at high tide and are shown to be able to return to their pool of first
capture over considerable distances.
INTRODUCTION:
It has been shown of many different organisms found in the intertidal zone
that Individuals within a species can locate a particular area of the intertidal and
repeatedly come back to it during the time of the tidal cycle that is most adaptive for
its suvivability. The chiton M masa is known to occupy a particular
homesite at low tide but moves away from it and back along the same pathway at
times when it is submerged or awash. Similarly, the limpet Collisella scabra returns
regularly at low tide to a specific area of a rock which closely matches the contour of
its shell. However, homing ability is not necessarily consistent among all
invertebrates, for Collisella digitalis shows no homing response in some areas, and
in other areas it returns to a particular homesite only up to 54% of the time (Morris
Abbott and Haderlie, Hvo). Several species of intertidal fish have exhibited the ability
to appear in the same tidepools over wo different low tides when they have been
seen at considerable distances from the pools in which they had last been observed
I was suggested that navigational cues were used to bring the fish back to their
"home" pools and assured them safe refuge at low tide (Williams, 1954). However, a
