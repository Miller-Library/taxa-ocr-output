Pool C. The fish that was missing from Pool C was the smallest individual captured,
measuring 2.7 cm in length (See Appendix 5).
Mid Tide Observations:
RRTTAY
Ontwo occasions lwatched Area A next to tidepool 3 as the tide level moved
lower than this point. Ofthe 7 fish that were subsequently observed to be in the pool
when it was completely isolated, 1 saw 4 individuals of Pool 3 in this area
approximately 20 cm away from the lip of the pool. The surge was high as the waves
moved Into this area, and at times the fish were no more than 2 cm under the water.
At one time the surge moyed out so quickly as to leave one individual standed
without water for several seconds until the next wave came in. At this time the fish
moved towards the lip and eventually down into the pool. Actlviy seemed to be
directed to moving slowly down into the pool with each lower surge, and occasionally
saw some of the fish exhibit a feeding behavior on some neighboring algae. On
one instance  saw a tagged fish from Pool 3 Inhabiting Pool 4. Before the pools
were isolated, however, the fish moved from Pool 4 into its original pool and
remained there till the next high tide.
lalso observed the tide as Itcame In over Pool 3 and flooded Area A. As the
water moved higher, individuals tended to orient themsewes vertically with thel
heads up on the sides of the pool, and with every surge they moved higher on the
rock and closer to the surace. As was observed during the tansition as the tide wert
out, the fish tended to remain only 2 to 3 cm underneath the surface of the water unti
the pool was flooded enough so that they could move into Area A. 5 of the 7
individuals observed at the previous low tide, all within 3.1 to 3.5 cm, were the first
fish out of the pool and they were seen in Area Aas soon as t had been covered with
