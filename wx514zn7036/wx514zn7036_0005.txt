Pools were examined dally when exposed by low tide from May 18 to June 4.
On each occasion lobserved each pool for approximately 10 minutes without pool
disturbance, recording each fish that! saw.I then made a thorough search of my
pool using the handle of the fish net to observe all those fish that were previousy out
of view. All new fish were caught and tagged or retagged as was needed. For a
detalled account of daily observations and releases, see Appendix 2.

Fldelly to a glven pool was determined by the number of times a fish was
seen in its original pool of capture divided by the number of low tides
observed from the first sighting of the fish to the last and reported as a
percentage. Fish that were observed for 3 days or less were not used in the
fidelity calculations, for a fish that was seen 3times in its original pool of
capture but was seen only over a total of 3 days would show 100 % fide lit
when, In fact, the amount of time It was observed was not enough to say the
individual was 100% partial to Es pool.
DEPR
Several tests were done to determine fideliyy of fish to an area by tagging
and displacing fish. Icaught and tagged 5 fish from 2 pools, Pool A and Pool
B, 50 cm away from each other and 16m away from my area and,
released them into Pool 2. On another occasion Iperfonned the
displacement experiment on 3 more individuals from a pool 18 m away, Poo
C. Individuals varied in length from 2.7 to 5.2 cm.
MT-TARe
On two occasions lobserved the tide coming in and the tide going out over a
40X 40 cm area, which lcalled Area A, located between pools 3 and 5 (Figure 2). At
