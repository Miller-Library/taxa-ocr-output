over a similar period of time (K. Jensen, 1989), the population decline observed ma
not be due to the tagging disturbance but can possibly be attributed to the longer-
term Intertidepool migration suggested earlier. To determine this, however, periods
of dally observations would need to be continued for more than bo weeks and a
greater area of tidepools assessed for appearance of individuals.
High tide data shovs that members of the Catis anats species cleart
do not inhabit their tidepools at high tide and the majority of them do not reside in the
area one meter adjacent to these areas. Ir the fish are not in their pools nor are in the
immediate vicinity, they must move to areas greater than one meter away, suggesting
that perhaps mechanisms of homing are used to direct individuals back to their
primary pool of residence. Results from the displacement experiments clearty
support the presence of navigational ability sufficient to carry out homing, for within
one tidal cycle, individuals as small as 2.8 cm were able to successfully return to the ir
respective pools over 16 meters even though the pools themselves were separated
only by 50 cm in distance. It would seem plausible that an accurate homing
mechanism serves a key evolutionary purpose in these intertidal fish, for if they are
accidentally swept away from their pool of residence or bavel conslderable distances
In search of food or other attractants, it would be adaptive to have a mechanism to
bring them back to a familiar area of the intertidal so that they are not caught above
water or arbirarlly rind a tidepool that may not be physically advantageous (le
presence of predators, minimal algae cover, insufficient oxygen levels, etc.). In
addition, homing permits the exploitation of a larger area of the intertidal, anc
movement patterns associated with the tidal cycles, weather, and seasons may
necessitate homing as the fish search over a greater area for food resources.
The surprising Invasion of cottids larger than 10 cm in length in places that
were inhabited by identified fish raises questions as to the behavior and
whereabouts of the tagged individuals if they were not within immediate distance of
