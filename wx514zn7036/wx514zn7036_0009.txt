water. The same fish that ! had seen move from Pool 4 to Pool 3 as the tide went out
swam over the bordering rock and again exited Pool 3 into Pool 4. Activity was
conslderable, with the fish actkely moving up with the water as well as feeding at
areas not accessible to them at low tide. Upon looking into Pool 3 at this time, also
noticed à large, newfish present that had not been there before at the low tide.
High Tide Observations:
RRTIKY
At high tide, the fish within one meter from the edge of the pools were all
sitting very stationary on horizontal rock faces or sometimes positioned obviousyy in
shallow cracks In the granite.I saw minimal movement at this time, and lwas even
able to snorkel directly over the fish without apparent disturbance. did not see fish
hidden in the algae or beneath rocks or debris, but saw them instead siting in
exposed areas of the study site. On 10 of the 11 high tide observations made,
discovered one or more large sculpin » 10 cm in length in the bottoms of the pools,
and once lobserved an eel blenny in Pool 3. Surfperch were also seen swimming in
the area over my study site.

The number of fish inside the pools at high tide was exceptionally small. On
any given day, the percentage of fish out of their pools was consistently over 80%,
with 3 occasions of 100% vacancy (See Table 2). Most of the fish, ranging from 4224
missing on one occasion to 91% on another, disappeared from the entire study area,
and a maximum of 7 and a minimum of 1 individual seen on any one day. Of the one
third that remained, 95% were seen within 50 cm of their pool of first capture. Fish
