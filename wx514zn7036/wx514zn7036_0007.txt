lower fidelly to a particular tidepool, and 18, or 86% of the population, had a greater
than 60% fidelity to the tidepool in which they were first captured. Length varied with
fidelly, with the fish In the 4.0 to 4.9 cm range showing a 9125 fidellt while those In
the 5.0 to 5.9 range showed onty 56% fidelit (Figure 4). One must note, however,
the small sample size of those in the 5.0 cm range, for 3 out of the 6 tagged fish in
this length range were never seen more than 4 days and were thus excluded from
the calculations.

Because watched the pools on a dally basts, could ascertain distinct
movement patterns among individuals (See Figure 5). Over the course of the study,
only 3 fish were seen In any of the other 4 experimental pools. On each occasion,
however, never again saw that individual in the pool of its first capture, suggesting
that it had perhaps relocated to a different pool entire ly. 4 individuals each missed 2
consecutive lowtides at the beginning of my observations, but then returned to ther
original pools and appeared there on an every day, every other day basis. Only one
fish missed 3 low tides in a row, and this individual also returned to a regular
schedule of every day appearance at low tide. The great majority of the fish, or 67%6,
however, were never gone from their pool for more than a day, with some individuals
appearing consistently every day such that lalmost expected to see them on each
observation. One of these indlviduals showed an exceptional 100% ridellty by
Inhabiting the pool every day for each of my 12 low tide counts (See Appendix 4).

On the next low tide after the displacement experiments were performed, all
tagged individuals were gone from Pool 2. Upon examination of Pools A, B and C,
observed 100% return of beaded fish in Pools A and B, and 2 of the 3 returned to
