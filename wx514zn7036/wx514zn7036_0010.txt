inside the pools ranged in length from 3.5 to 5.5 cm and 4 individuals were seen
twice each in their respective pools.
DISCUSSION:
Fromthe above resutts it ls apparent that over a course of 18 days, a majorit
of Chtus anais individuals have a high fidelity to specific tidepools and
regularly return to them at low tide. From the resutts of the displacement studies
observed fidelly to a tidepool was not due simply to the fact that those fish were
replaced there at low tide after capture; hence, the appearance of an individual tice
at Ã  certaln tidepool Indicated that other factors affecting fidellty were Involed. Upon
comparing these findings with those of Richkus (1978),was surprised to discover
the remarkably small percentage of fish that missed more than 1 consecutive day
away from the original pool of capture, for he reported that samplings in bo week
intervals showed a low percent of recapture of tagged individuals in their original
pools, and he further demonstated a rise in this percent recapture as he sampled al
pools In the area. It is interesting to note that ! found only 3 individuals out of 31 that
appeared in any one of the other 5 pools observed, comprising only 14 % of the
population, as opposed to the 67% of tagged fish that appeared only in their original
pools and occaslonally moved elsewhere out of the study site for no more than one
low tide. These findings suggest that the daily movements of individuals over an
approximately two-week perlod follovs a markedly different pattern than those
reported for the same specles in a different habitat, sampled biweekly. An alteration
of the earlier schematic due to these new findings suggests that, on the time scale
observed, the majority of individuals have either one or more pools to which they are
faithful outside ofthe study area, or they have a series of pools in which they reside
only bansienty in addition to their primary pool of residence (Figure 6). As it has
