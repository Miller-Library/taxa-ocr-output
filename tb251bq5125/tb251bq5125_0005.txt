Effects of Mechanical Stimulation, Vibration, and Current
Efforts were made to reduce the vibration experienced by the experimen¬
tal populations to a minimum. To dampen out vibration, the table upon
which the cold room set ups were maintained was mounted on four heavy
gage foam rubber pads (l6xl6x5 cm). In the incubator experiment the
door was not opened during the entire experiment. Foot traffic in
the vicinity of the cold room and incubator was kept to a minimum.
Even with these efforts there were variations in the amount of vi¬
bration experienced by the experimental populations due to locational
differences as well as positional differences on the same table.
The relative intensity of vibration experienced by each popula¬
tion was ranked. In the cold room this was done at the end of the ex¬
periment by having two imparfial witnesses visually rank the intensity
of ripples seen on the water surface in each finger bowl or flask when
one of us stomped hard in the middle of the cold room floor. We were
the only ones to enter the cold room during the course of these experi¬
ments and did so one at a time. In the incubator experiment, the air¬
mix fan produced a fairly constant low intensity, high frequency vi¬
bration.
To test the effect of current on feeding activity a stirring rod
with plastic paddle on the bottom was suspended from and rotated by a
small motor mounted on a ring stand. The current-producing paddle was
inserted in a submerged conical compartment with baffles that directed
a smooth lamilar current up the sides of the 4 liter beaker and back
down into the conical compartment. The paddle rotated at 60 rev/min
(Figure 7). A food supply (diatoms in sea water solution) was
dripped into the beaker through a capillary tube at the rate of 5.0510
cells/min (=.5 ml/min). Water was siphoned out of the beaker at the
same rate via another capillary tube.
