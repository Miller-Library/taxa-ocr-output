INTRODUCTION
Intertidal organisms experience two extreme environmental con¬
ditions that oscillate regularly and predictably with the tides. Ex-
posure presents several dangers: desiccation, predation, osmotic stress
in the form of rain, and wide temperature fluctuation. In contrast, sub¬
mersion necessitates coping with different predators and wave shock
while attempting to feed. Though these changes are drastic, their time
course constitutes a schedule to which adaptation may be selectively ad¬
vantageous. Animals with predictive endogenous tidal clocks can ready
themselves for changes in conditions and can avoid inappropriate activ¬
ity when exogenous cues are ambiguous.
Adaptations in the form of tidal rhythms are expressed in several
marine and maritime species as indicated by studies of the crabs Car-
cinus maenas (Naylor, 1958) and Uca pugnax (Brown, Brown, Webb, Bennett,
and Shriner, 1956) and the isopod Excirolana chiltoni (Enright, 1972),
among others. Documented tidal rhythms in sessile organisms are not as
common, although Mytilus californianus and Mytilus edulis have been
shown to possess a filtration rate rhythm (Rao, 1954). Feeding activ¬
ity in intertidal organisms could understandably be aided by endogenous
tidal rhythms, which would allow the animals to capitalize on the pre¬
dictability of a food supply provided by the rising tide.
Circatidal feeding rhythms in two intertidal barnacles, Chthamalus
dalli (Darwin, 1854) and Chthamalus fissus (Pilsbry, 1916), are docu-
mented in the present paper. Under constant conditions these barnacles
show higher feeding activity at high tide and lower activity at low
tide. Results are presented as evidence for the rhythm and as indica¬
tions of factors having an effect on the rhythm, such as vibration and
habitat differences.
