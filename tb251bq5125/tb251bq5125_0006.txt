The methods for the constant condition experiments with C. dalli
have been mentioned. Identical experiments were conducted with C.
fissus, the only difference being that the plain sea water experiment
was performed in the incubator rather than the cold room.
Individuals. Our first analysis of individuals was done on 10
barnacles, 9 C. fissus and 1 C. dalli collected from site two. These
animals were analyzed for activity/ non activity and for number of
feeding movements per minute. Counts were made for one minute on the
hour for 18 hours.
A second survey of feeding activity in individuals was undertaken
again using animals from site two. Feeding of 4 C. dalli and 5 C.
fissus kept under constant conditions in filtered sea water was scored
at periods corresponding to high and low tides. The animals were
scored as either active or inactive for the first 10 seconds of each
of the first five minutes starting at and just following high and low
tides.
RESULT!
Demonstration of an Endogenous Feeding Rhythm. The results of
the 80 hour continuous study are shown in Figure 1. The percent of the
population feeding ranges from a low of 07 (12:36 a.m.,5/29) to a high
of 55% (10:36a.m.,5/31). Chi-square tests comparing the summed popu¬
lation frequency feeding (instantaneous number feeding) during read¬
ings corresponding to the exact times of high tides with readings
corresponding to the exact times of low tide shows significant differ¬
ences (P—.005). The period of the oscillation is approximately 12
hours. Counting was by method A.
Effects of Reversing Tidal Regime. Figure 2 shows the graph of
the population receiving a reversed exposure/submergence regime and
compares it with the population that received no change in schedule.
