Carlson/Roux-8
Animals 3,4,5, and 6, all C. dalli, were generally active under con¬
stant conditions during hightide periods while animals 1,2,7,8, and 9,
are much less predictable. This result is in agreement with data from
whole populations. Animals 4,5, and 6, all C. dalli, were densely
packed neighbors and to a large extent their behavior was synchronous.
The same is true of animals 7 and 8, both C. fissus.
DISCUSSION
A circatidal feeding rhythm, which continued undiminished for the
80 hour experiment under constant conditions, was found in Chthamalus.
Using the preliminary phase of a periodogram analysis (Enright 1965),
i.e. by finding a period which maximizes variance, we estimated the
period to be between 11.5 and 12.5 hours. Several free runs under con¬
stant conditions indicate that the period may be slightly less than 12
hours. Exact determination of the period will require further experi¬
mentation where feeding activity is monitored continuously rather than
at 3 hour intervals as was done in this study.
Not all of the data presented support the correspondence of feeding
and high tide. In Figure 1 both plots have periods of presumptive low
tide where a high percentage of animals are feeding. The plot for the
filtered sea water experiment also has a period of presumptive high
tide with a low percentage of animals feeding. These two experiments
were carried out simultaneously in adjacent areas, about 4 inches
apart. At 12:20 p.m., May 30, the cold room was entered to adjust the
apparatus for the filtered sea water experiment. It is possible that
the discrepancies in data are the results of perturbations which
occurred at this time. One should note that the oscillations are irreg¬
ular for about 1.5 periods just after 12:20 p.m.,May 30, but that the
"correct" feeding/tidal relation soon returns and persists throughout
