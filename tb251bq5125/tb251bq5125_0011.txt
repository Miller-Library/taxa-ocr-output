in still water. The only two intertidal barnacles examined in their
study, Balanus cariosus and Tetraclita squamosa, were maintained in
moving water. One would not expect a tidal rhythm to be adaptive for a
deep water barnacle and it appears that the experimental conditions were
inappropriate to detect a rhythm in the intertidal species examined.
It is suggested that for the species studied an endogenous
tidal rhythm would be of greater advantage for feeding than an opening
response to being wetted. Attempting to feed on matter delivered by
exceptionally high splash could result in the loss of reserve internal
moisture should an animal repeat extension of the cirri after the water
recedes. Also, moistening by rain water would be harmful if the barn¬
acle responded by attempting to feed. Alternatively, physiological
preparation for a time when the animal would be submerged for several
hours would reduce the risk of desiccation and perhaps conserve energy
and materials.
Though further experimentation is needed to determine the reason
or reasons for differences observed between species and/or locations,
the higher variability of the exposed environment of C. dalli may
account for a more tightly regulated rhythm. Because there is more
chance of an exceptional wave during periods of exposure it is likely
that mechanisms have evolved to optimize feeding ability during the
more dependable periods of submergence.
The rigidity imposed by fixed locations may influence tidal
rhythms in animals like barnacles, which experience the regularity
and severity of the tides with greater consistency than mobile organ¬
isms. It seems likely that sessile animals would develop more finely
tuned rhythms because of limitations of other methods of coping with the
environment.
Further experimentation with various sessile intertidal organisms.
