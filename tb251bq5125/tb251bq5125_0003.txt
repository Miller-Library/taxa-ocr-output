normal exposure/submersion regime of the animals were studied, and
those groups upon which the effects of currents were studied, all groups
were submerged in still sea water.
Two methods were used to measure feeding activity. Method A was
to enter the cold room and make counts visually with a hand-held mag-
nifying glass. Method B was to record the animals' activity using a
Sanyo Model + VC 1130 video tape camera and a Sanyo Model #VCord II
video tape player/recorder and to subsequently analyze the tape. A
20 mm Bolex extension tube was used to increase the magnificaion of the
camera. Both counting methods offered certain advantages. With
method A, we had a larger field of view and could therefore assess the
activity of a larger population. Method B offered the advantage that
we could record the activity of the barnacles and later have an un¬
biased researcher, without knowledge of the state of the tide at the
time of the reading, make the counts. Such a strategy of analysis re¬
duced the effect of reasearcher subjectivity. The videotape afforded
better magnification than the magnifying glass and was therefore better
suited for studying individual Chthamalus. The counting method used is
indicated along with the results of each study. An animal was scored
as actively feeding if the cirri moved out of the operculum during ob¬
servation.
Demonstration of an Endogenous Feeding Rhythm. Temporal fluctua-
tions in feeding during conditions of constant submersion in calm water
were documented and characterized by placing the barnacles, C. dalli,
on a plastic stand within a 4 liter beaker of sea water such that the
animals were approximately 4 cm from the surface. Counts of the number
of animals feeding were made every 3 hours for 80 hours. This experi¬
ment was repeated using filtered sea water instead of plain sea water.
