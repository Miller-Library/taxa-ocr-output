FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Two populations under constant conditions exhibit tidal rhythms
throughout an 80 hour study. N (normal sea water)-54, N (filtered sea
water)=45. Shaded bars indicate periods that experimental populations
would have been submerged in their natural environment. Arrows indicate
time of experimental disturbance (see Discussion, p. 7).
Figure 2. Plot of reversed tidal regime against undisturbed schedule
under constant conditions in normal sea water (see also 'normal sea
water' Figure 1). N (reversed)=73, N (normal)-54. Shaded bars indi-
cate periods that the reversal regime population would have been sub-
merged had the reversed schedule been continued. Both populations were
constantly submerged.
Figure 3. Graph of data from experiment studying effects of current.
N =140. Dotted vertical line on left indicates small gap in time of
data collection, and the time axis shifts slightly. The shorter dotted
line on the right indicates period where no data was taken, here the
time axis does not shift. Arrow on the left indicates time when current
was turned off, right hand arrow indicates return of current. Shaded
bars indicate periods that the population would have been submerged in
its natural environment.
Figure 4. Comparison of species in normal sea water. N (mixed)=112
with 927 C. fissus and 87 C. dalli, N (C. dalli)-54. Shaded bars indi-
cate periods that experimental populations would have been submerged in
their natural environment.
Figure 5. Comparison of species in filtered sea water. N (mixed)-65
with 807 C. fissus and 207 C. dalli, N (C. dalli)-45. Shaded bars indiÂ¬
cate periods that experimental populations would have been submerged in
their natural environment.
