difficult except at the population level.
Results of the second analysis of individuals indicate that
neighboring barnacles are similar in the time course of their be¬
havior. The implication here is that there is a group effect, that
neighbors may affect one another's behavior. This possibility is also
suggested by the observation that often there are'islands' of near syn¬
chronous activity within a large population under constant conditions.
We found that the species we studied, C. dalli and C. fissus, are very
sensitive to even weak currents. The group effect described could re¬
flect a phenomenon where the currents produced by an animal's cirral
activity prompt its neighbors to feed.
Generally, experimenters working with barnacles store and observe
the animals in environments where fresh sea water is continually pro¬
vided and some sort of aeration system is present to insure sufficient
oxygen tension. The introduction of water and the aeration process
produce water currents and vibrations. Even low levels of such mechan¬
ical stimulations may override or otherwise change a tidal rhythm, as
shown in this study and by others (Enright, 1965). Therefore, it is
not surprising that this tidal rhythm has not been previously dis-
covered. Southward and Crisp (1965) analyzed several species of barn¬
acles under conditions of constant temperature and low illumination
for activity rhythms in feeding. They did detect semi-regular oscilla¬
tions between feeding activity and inactivity. However, in no species
was this oscillation shown to exhibit correlation with the tidal cycle,
the only exception being a single specimen of Eliminus modestus which
showed an increase in activity just prior to high water as one would
expect if tidal periodicity was a factor in behavior. It is interest-
ing to note that Southward and Crisp analyzed only deep water barnacles
