Effects of Reversing the Normal Tidal Regime. In the laboratory,
a population of C. dalli was subjected to a reversed exposure/submerÂ¬
gence regime. The barnacles were submerged in a 165 x5 cm circular
finger bowl for 6.2 hours during the time of actual low tide and then
exposed for the 6.2 hours centered around the time of actual high tide.
This cycle was repeated for two tidal cycles, approximately 50 hours,
after which the barnacles were placed back in the finger bowl under
conditions of constant submergence, light intensity, and temperature.
Feeding activity was assessed every three hours for 36 hours.
