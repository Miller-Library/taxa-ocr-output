ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We enthusiastically and gratefully thank Dr. Robin Burnett for
his round-the-clock support, energy and advice. His insight and curios¬
ity about our animals stimulated us in our efforts. Our thanks also go
to Mr. John Kono for his help in construction of equipment and to Dr,
Eugene Haderlie at the Naval Post Graduate School for his help in iden¬
tification of barnacle species. We are grateful to Lawrence W. Harding,
Jr. for being there when we needed him. And to everyone at Hopkins,
faculty, staff and students, go our thanks for their constant support
and love of good times. Lastly, we acknowledge all those who routed
us out of our sleeping bags for our middle-of-the-night readings and at
other times made staying up all night almost enjoyable.
