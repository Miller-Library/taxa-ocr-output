Figure 6. Plot of activity of 3 individuals over an 18.5 hour period.
Measurements were made in extensions per number of seconds active in
one minute.
Figure 7. Diagram of the setup in an experiment studying effects of
current. Barnacles are on a rock supported by plastic mesh. Diatom
culture is dripped in through capillary tube (see Materials and Methods,
p. 4, for details).
Table 1. Comparison of quality of rhythm with amount of vibration reÂ¬
ceived during experimentation for 6 populations.
Table 2. Plot of activity of 9 individuals in 5 minute segments at
times of high and low tides. Shaded bars at the top indicate high tide
periods, white bars indicate low tide periods. A'+' indicates feeding
activity, a '-' indicates inactivity for the first 10 seconds of the
minute indicated at the bottom of the table.
