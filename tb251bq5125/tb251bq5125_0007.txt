Carlson/Roux-7
The Chi-square test shows significantly higher activity (Ps.005) dur¬
ing periods when the barnacles would have been submerged had the re¬
versed schedule been continued. The two curves are near inverses of
eachother. Counting was by method A.
Effects of Mechanical Stimulation, Vibration, and Current.
Table I relates the quality (amplitude and regularity) of rhythm with
amount of vibration undergone during experimentation. A general trend
is indicated, clearest rhythms having received the least vibration.
Figure 3 shows the results of an experiment testing current
effects. Chi-square test shows differences between high and low tides
to be insignificant. Extremes of activity ranged from 727 to 977.
which is an elevated range in relation to other experiments. Counting
method B was used here.
Species Differences. Figure 4 compares a population of C. dalli
with a mixed population of 807 C. fissus and 207 C. dalli. (The mixed
population was tested in the incubator using method B, C. dalli in the
cold room using method A). C. dalli shows a more distinct rhythmicity
than the mixed population. A second comparison is made in Figure 5.
Method A was used to count both populations. These experimental popu¬
lations were under identical conditions, this time in filtered sea
water. Again, the rhythm is clearer and more persistent in C. dalli.
Individuals. Throughout the first analysis of individuals all of
the subjects analyzed were active during all readings. However, it
must be noted that we observed them for a full minute and did not break
that minute into segments. Therefore, an animal active for 60 seconds
was scored the same as one active for 10 seconds. Graphs of the rate of
cirral extension also failed to give evidence of any periodicity (Fig.6).
Table 2 gives the results of the second analysis of individuals.
