the experiment (3 periods).
After reversing the periods of exposure and of submergence there
was a phase shift in the feeding rhythm of a population of C. dalli.
What cue was responsible for this induced phase shift is not yet known.
We and others (Crisp and Southward, 1961) have shown that currents do
strongly affect the feeding behavior of barnacles. In our studies it
has also become apparent that vibration may have a profound effect on
feeding behavior. It is possible that current and vibration consfitute
the same stimulus to a barnacle. These two factors and the state of
being submerged stand out as the most probable factors involved in the
entrainment of this rhythm. All three of these factors were present
at the appropriate times in the reversal experiment. Further experi¬
mentation is required to determine which factor(s) was (were) respon¬
sible for the phase shift observed.
Our results (Figures 4 and 5) suggest that there are species¬
specific differences in the rhythmicity of feeding for C. dalli and C.
fissus. However, it must be pointed out that all of the C. fissus in
the study were obtained from site two, which differed radically from
site one in physical characterisfics (see Materials and Methods).
Furthermore, some C. dalli individuals from site two did not reflect
the rhythm. The apparent difference in behavior between C. dalli and
C. fissus could in fact be a reflection of a difference in the habitats
from which the animals were collected. Transplantation experiments
where C. fissus individuals are moved to site one and C. dalli indivi-
duals moved from site one to site two with subsequent analysis of
rhythmicity may ultimately give an answer to this question.
Not only does there appear to be a species difference in the ex¬
pression of this tidal rhythm, but individual differences are also
apparent. The data of Figure 6 show that individual variation in time
and rate of feeding can be great and may make resolution of the rhythm
