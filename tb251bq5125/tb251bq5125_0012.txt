Carlson/Roux-12
(other barnacles, tunicates, sponges, hydrozoa, colonial worms, etc.),
may reveal existence of other tidal rhythms,
SUMMARY
1. Experiments conducted at Hopkins Marine Station, Mussel Point,
Monterey Bay, California, have revealed that the intertidal barnacles
Chthamalus dalli and Chthamalus fissus exhibit tidal feeding rhythms
under conditions of constant temperature , constant light and constant
submersion.
2. For both species of barnacle, the period of the rhythm is between
11.5 and 12.5 hours.
3. It appears that C. dalli shows a clearer rhythm than C. fissus.
However, this has yet to be ascertained unequivocally and could be a
product of differences in collection sites.
4. Vibration, water currents, water volume and temperature are facÂ¬
tors which can modify the character of the feeding rhythms.
5. The phase of the rhythm can be shifted by experimentally reversing
the time course of the periods of exposure and submersion.
6. Clearest and most persistent rhythmicity was observed with maximum
water volume and mimimum vibration,
