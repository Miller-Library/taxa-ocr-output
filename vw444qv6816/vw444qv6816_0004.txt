a preselected landmark just above the heart. The hearts were
recorded for a time encompassing about twenty reversals.
The selected environmental manipulations were performed
exclusively on Clavelina huntsmani. A Clavelina often shares
its circulatory system with one of two asexually budded indi¬
viduals. This complication was avoided with the selection of
animals which lacked fully developed buds. Temperature mani¬
ulations were performed by setting a coiled copper tube coated
with nail polish in the finger bowl with the animal. A circul¬
ating cooling unit pumped antifreeze solution at various reg-
ulated temperatures through the coil. This system was also
used to keep the seawater at ambient ocean temperature (12.5°C)
during other environmental manipulations. NaDH and HEl were
used to adjust the Ph of the seawater. The low salinity sol¬
ution consisted of 20% distilled water and 80% seawater. For
high salinity, 2.69 of Nacl was added to 100ml seawater. For
injury studies, animals were stabbed with a sharp, pointed
scalpel through the branchial basket Imm below the oral
siphon. The injury test was repeated on animals anesthetized
with procaine. Procaine was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
and was used at a concentration of 0.125 mm.
