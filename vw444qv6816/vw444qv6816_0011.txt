numbers per period at lower temperatures because a heart beating
more slowly would be less prone to fatique. Also, the occas¬
ional absence of slowing before a reversal and the variable
nature of the beating pattern before reversals strongly sug¬
gest that other factors must be involved in heart regulation.
The fact remains, however, that a regular pattern of heart
reversal can be observed in living specimens from all six
species.studied. This regularity seems primarily dependent
on the absolute number of beats, rather than on time or heart
rate. Thus, it is logical to conclude that an endogenous,
number-dependent regulatory mechanism exists in the tunicate
for the control of heart reversal. However, fluctuations from
regular patterns of reversal, such as those caused by injury,
suggest that this "heartbeat counter" is also succeptible
to influence from other regulatory mechanisms.
Une type of heartbeat counter mechanism that has been
suggested is the back-pressure theory (Haywood and Moon, 1953).
Une can see how buildup of pressure on one side of the body
during a period of unidirectional beating might depend on the
number of beats that have occurred. The mechanism of pressure's
effect on reversal is postulated to be an inhibition of the
active pacemaker on the venous end of the heart because blood
pressure decreases there. This lower rate then facilitates
a reversal. However, the idea that low pressure induced in¬
hibition causes a lower heart rate is contradicted by the
observation that severe bleeding in the animal caused neither
a directional preference nor slowing of the heart rate. (Figure 5
