These deficiencies led me to perform in vivo heart rate and
reversal pattern recordings for six species of ascidians.
hese six (Ascidia ceratodes, Ciona intestinalis, Perophora
annectens, Clavelina huntsmani, Botrylloides sp., and
Botryllus sp.) were chosen to provide a variety of sizes and
morphological characteristics as well as a broad taxonomic
representation. Also, more detailed experiments testing the
reaction of the heart in the tunicate (Clavelina huntsmani)
to changes in temperature, Ph, salinity, and injury were per¬
formed. Such variations were selected as representative of
a few of the environmental challenges that a Clavelina, living
on intertidal rocks, might encounter.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
tach animal was allowed to relax in a clear finger bowl
filled with seawater at 12.5°C, which is ambient temperature
for the Monterey Bay, Ca. Then, in each living tunicate,
the beating heart was viewed via transmitted light with a dis-
secting microscope. The tunics of all species studied exceot
Ascidia ceratodes were transparent enough that the heart could
be thus viewed. Since only a few of the Ascidia were clear
enough for such observation, the rest had a small window cut
above the heart for easier viewing. The cut animals were
allowed to stabilize for 24 hours before the recordings the
recordings were made.
A polygraph chart recorder moving at Imm per second was
Used to record heartbeat. A manual switch induced a spike on
either side of a baseline (upward indicating a pharyngeal beat;
dounward for a visceral beat) every time a propagation passed
