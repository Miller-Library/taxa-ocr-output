ABSTRACT: 1. The bidirectional hearts of the
tunicates Ascidia ceratodes, Ciona intestinalis,
and Clavelina huntsmani showed preferred dir-
ectionality in number, rate, and period of
beating.
2. Each species tested demonstrated a charact¬
eristic reversal pattern, but there were large
individual variations from the species averages.
3. Temperature affected both rate and period
of beating, but it did not affect number of
beats per period.
4. Salinity changes and injury had significant
effects on the cardiac function of Clavelina
huntsmani. Changes in Ph had no effect.
5. Heart rate slowed just before reversal in
all six species tested.
6. There are at least five different types of
heartbeat reversal.
7. An endogenous counting mechanism seems to be
a major means of regulating reversal.
INTRODUCTION
The tubular hearts of ascidians have fascinated research-
ers since the early 1800's. (Kuhl and v. Hasselt, 1822) The
heartbeat consists of peristaltic contractions propagating
along the length of the thin muscular tube. Periodically,
the direction of the contraction reverses so that the pro¬
pagations travel alternately in the "visceral" direction
(toward the base of the animal) and in the "pharyngeal" dir¬
ection (toward the pharynx).
Many studies have been reported concerning the causes
of this heartheat reversal and the possible regulation of it.
There are at least three reasonable theories which attempt
explaining this phenomenon. The first is the pacemaker fatique
