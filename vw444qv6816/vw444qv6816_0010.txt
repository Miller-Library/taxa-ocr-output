hearts beating with directionality preferences would be coun¬
terproductive. Also, the back-pressure theory (Haywood and
Moon, 1953) would suggest that this evenness is synchron¬
ized through the colony by means of pressure induced reversals.
Ubservations of natural fluctuations in the three recorded
parameters (number per period, reversal frequency, and rate
of heartbeat in each direction) as well as the environmental
effects on these living animals indicate that the regulation
of heartbeat reversal in tunicates is much more complexxthan
past investigators have suggested.
Pacemaker "fatigue", as mentioned in the introduction,
is a leading theory for cause of reversal because both ends
of an isolated heart showed alternate periods of beating and
resting even when the heart was bisected. As mentioned in the
results, the most common type of reversal in the living animal
involved slowing, a pause, and then reversal. The consistency
of this observation supports pacemaker fatique as a dominant
cause of reversal. However, "fatique", if it is defined in
the classical sense, (a decreased ability to function due to
repetative action) cannot directly cause heartbeat reversal.
The reason for this is that, over a wide range of temperatures,
the beat and reversal rate of Clavelina huntsmani changed dra¬
matically, but the numbers of beats per period remained nearly
constant. Thus, a period seems to be defined by a particular
number of beats regardless of how rapidly the heart is beating,
(See Figures 24 and 28) This is contrary to the "fatigue"
theory which would have predicted thetheart to beat for larger
