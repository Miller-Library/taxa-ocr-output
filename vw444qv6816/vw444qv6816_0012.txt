The only change observed was an increase in reversal freg¬
uency to establish a new, regular pattern, where the back-
pressure theory predicts that a decrease in blood pressure
should have slowed at least the pharyngeal pacemaker (nearest
the cut) if not both pacemakers.
Manipulations of salinity (Figure 4) were observed to have
significant effects on both the heart rate and reversal pat¬
tern, but, again, the effects on reversal pattern were far more
dramatic. It is possible that the salinity fluctuations effec¬
tively caused blood pressure changes (due to osmotic stresses)
which might affect heartbeat. However, the time course of such
an effect as well as the osmotic gradients would be too com¬
plicated to determine. Also, possible effects of salinity
changes on muscle and nerve action potentials or on the heart's
contractile machinery might further complicate the situation.
The most interpretable of the salinity results was the fact
that high salinity consistently had a much more dramatic
effect on heart function than did low salinity. This seems
ecologically significant in that a Clavelina huntsmani living
on an intertidal rock is more likely to encounter salinities
much lower than seawater's (eg. rain) than much higher salin¬
ities. Thus, the ability of the heart to cope better with low
salinities can be interpreted as a possible ecological adapt-
ation.
Two observations discounted any important influence of
the force of body contraction on heart reversal. First,
spontaneous body contractions occurred in all six species
without any noticable effect on the heart. Second, there was
