the patterns of reversal (B-E) occurred progressively less
frequently.
DISCUSSION
The overall species averages of visceral vs. pharyngeal
humber, period, and rate of beating showed that the most sig¬
nificant differences between the six tested species were in
rate of beating and period between reversals. The differ-
ences between the average number of beats per period for each
species were much less pronounced. For instance, Clavelina
huntsmani and Botrylloides beat, on the average, the same
number of beats in the visceral direction, but their visceral
heart rates differed by more than a factor of two.
Ihe differences between the rate and perind between rever¬
sal averages for these six species can be partially ex¬
plained in terms of morphological differences. For instance,
an inverse correlation exists between the average size of a
species and the average heart rate. The three smaller species,
(Perophora annectens, Botrylloides, and Botryllus) had heart
rates almost double those of the larger species, (Ascidia
ceratodes, Ciona intestinalis, and Clavelina huntsmani).
Also, the three smaller species were colonial tunicates with
common circulatory systems. The maintenance of the high blood
flow rates observed in common blood vessels in the test probably
demanded faster beating from the individual hearts.
The colonial blood systems hight also have been responsible
for the lack of directionality preference of heartbeat in
Perophora annectens, Botrylloides, and Botryllus. If even dis-
tribution of blood throughout the colony is to be maintained,
