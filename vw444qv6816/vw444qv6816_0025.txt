Figure 4. The effects of high and low salinity on heart rate
and reversal pattern in Clavelina huntsmani.
A represents the normal pattern in seawater of regular salinity.
B shous the plot of rate vs. time for the some organism in low
salinity seawater. Heart rate was not significantly altered,
but reversal frequency increased.
E shous the rate vs. time plot for the same organism in high
salinity seawater. After a long visceral period of beating at
the normal rate, both the rate and frequency of reversal
changed dramatically.
