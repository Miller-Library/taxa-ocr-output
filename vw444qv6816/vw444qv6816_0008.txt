Ihen, the unresponsive animals were injured with a scalpel,
again in the branchial basket. There was no body contraction
upon injury, but again, there was severe bleeding. Like
the unanesthetized animals, the heart rates were unaltered,
but the frequency of reversal increased.
Detailed Study of Reversal Types.
In all six species studied, there was usually a noticable
slowing of the heart rate just before reversal. Figure 6
illustrates this phenomenon in a sample Clavelina huntsmani,
where the reciprocal of the inter-beat interval (ie. the
instantaneous frequency) is plotted vs. beat number for a
period of unidirectional beating. There is a clear slowing
of heart rate between beats 300 and 500 after which a reversal
occurred.
This slowing, however, was not the only pattern of beat¬
ing associated with reversal. Figure 7 illustrates five
different types of reversals that were observed. The draw¬
ings are actual tracings of the actual polygraph recordings
made on sample Clavelina. Classification of the different
categories depended on whether the heart slowed before rev¬
ersal, whether there was a reversal pause (when the heart
stopped for about 5 seconds before reversal), and whether bi¬
directional beating (beats that started at both ends and col¬
lided in the middle) was associated with reversal. As shown
in Figure 7, the most common pattern consisted of heartbeat
slowing, a reversal pause, and then takeover by the other
pacemaker. There was no noticable difference in the way this
occurred at either end of the heart. As indicated in Figurer?,
