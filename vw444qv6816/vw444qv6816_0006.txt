Environmental Effects on Heartbeat of Clavelina huntsmani
Ihe observation of sudden changes in the heart reversal
patterns in all six species brought out the question of whether
such variations were random or induced by some unseen change
in the environment. Clavelina huntsmani was chosen for tests
on potential environmental influences because, although some
of these factors have been studied before, little work has
been applied to Clavelina huntsmani or to living samples..
Temperature had a clear effect on the rate of heartbeat
and the rate of reversal. The animal whose rate and period
of beating as a function of temperature is shown in Figure 24
demonstrated that as temperature increased, the heart rate also
increased dramatically. At the same time, the reversal freg¬
uency proportionally increased so that the number of beats in
each direction remained relatively constant over the entire
range of temperatures, as shown in Figure 28. Both ends of
the heart were similarly affected because there was no sig¬
nificant change in relative directionality. The fact that
number remained constant while period fluctuated demonstrated
that the number of beats may be the factor controlling the
occurrence of reversal.
Ph, on the other hand, had no significant on the number,
rate, or period of beating in either direction. (Figure 3)
Figure 4 illustrates the reversal pattern of another animal
in three different salinities. In low salinity, the frequency
of reversal increased, but the heart rate was not dramatically
altered. (Figure 48) The average ratio of the number of beats
