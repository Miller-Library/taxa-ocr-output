Figure 5. A) The effects of injury on rate and reversal
frequency of the heart in Clavelina huntsmani. Both bar
diagrams from A are from the same animal. The second was
recorded after the animal was stabbed in the branchial basket
with a scalpel. The heart rate did not change, but the reversal
frequency increased with two irregular reversals.
B) The effect of injury on rate and reversal frequency in a
Clavelina huntsmani anesthetized with procaine. An increase
of reversal frequency, similar to that of 5A can be sean.
