ACKNOULEDGEMENTS
I wish to express my sincere thanks to the following
people who made this project possible:
The entire faculty and staff of Hopkins Marine Station,
especially Dr. William F. Gilly whose patient support and
instruction, along with his technical assistance, helped
me immeasurably to properly apply my research efforts.
Al Vitale, with whom much of the comparative heart study was
performed.
