beating, and rate of beating for the six species of tunicates
observed. The species means were calculated from the indi¬
cated number of animals for heartbeat in each direction over
the entire period of observation. These calculations showed
that Ascidia ceratodes beats longer, faster, and preferentially
in the pharyngeal direction. Ciona intestinalis and Clavelina
huntsmani also showed directionality in number, period, and
rate, but these two species were biased toward the visceral
direction. Unlike the first three species, Perophora annectens,
Botrylloides, and Botryllus did not show significant direc¬
tional preferences.
Figure 1 illustrates bar diagrams of average rate vs. time
of beating. This gives an overall view of the reversal pattern
of an individual selected from each species whose direction¬
ality pattern roughly matches the species average. The diagram
for Ascidia ceratodes in Figure 1 demonstrated some of the
fluctuations in rate and reversal pattern that could be observed
in the individualssamples. Of the six species, Ascidia ceratodes
showed the greatest variability in number of beats and periods
of beating. Ciona intestinalis, on the other hand, had the
had the most regular pattern with almost no fluctuations in
any of the animals recorded. The other four species had
characteristic reversal patterns, but there were sporadic
deviations from them.
Spontaneous body contractions were observed during the
recordings in all six species. Although these contractions
usually involved a dramatic compression of the animal's form,
it was never seen to affect the heart rate or reversal pattern
in any way
