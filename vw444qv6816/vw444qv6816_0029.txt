Figure 6. Fluctuations of instantaneous heart rate before
reversal in Clavelina huntsmani. The rate (which is the
reciprocal of the inter-beat interval for each beat) is
plotted for every fifth beat as a function of the number of
beats which have occurred. A dramatic drog in heart rate from
beats 300 to 500 can be seen. A reversal occurred after the
last recorded beat.
