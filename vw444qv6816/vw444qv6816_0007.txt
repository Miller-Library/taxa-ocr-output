in the visceral vs. the pharyngeal direction did not signif¬
icantly change in low salinity. In high salinity, both the
ratepof beating and the reversal frequency were more sig¬
nificantly altered. Figure 40 shows that the heart beat for
an unusually long period in the visceral direction before
reversing. Its rate then slowed, and the beat became irregular
and spasmodic.
Uhen a Clavelina was injured with a scalpel, the zooid
contracted violently down inside the tunic and remained there
for over an hour. During this time, the heart rate was the
same as in the animal before injury, but the reversal frequency
increased. The pattern of reversal could become very irreg¬
ular, but in general, a regular but shorter reversal pattern
was the dominant feature as shown in Figure 5A. In order to
test whether mechanical agitation of the heart due to branchial
contraction following stabbing might be directly responsible
for the rapid heart reversals, and to question whether ner¬
vous pathways might be involved, the stabbing experiment was
repeated on animals paralyzed by 0.125mM procaine. (See Parker,
1981) Comparisons of "normal" heart recordings(ie. without
stabbing) before and after procaine anesthesia revealed that
procaine did not affect the heart's rate or reversal pat¬
tern for at least the first two hours of exposure. Exposure
to procaine for over three hours, however, caused serious
arhythmia in the heart. This effect was not studied in detail.
Figure 5B shows the reaction of a procaine anesthetized
animal to the stab insult. The animals used for the insult
experiments were exposed to procaine for one hour, after
which their pral siphons were no longer responsive to probing
