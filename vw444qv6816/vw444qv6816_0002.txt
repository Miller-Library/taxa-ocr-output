PONEC
theory which proposes that a pacemaker region at each end of
the heart periodically fatigues. Thus, uhen one end fatiques,
the "rested" end begins beating. This idea is strongly suo¬
ported by the experiment in which the heart was removed from
the body of a Ciona and cut in half. Millar (1953), Ebara (1954).
Krijgsman (1956), and others showed that each half of the
heart had alternate periods of beating and resting, sug-
gestive of fatigue. On the other hand, proponents of the
second theory, the back pressure theory, contend that while
the heart beats in one direction, pressure increases on its
arterial side and decreases on its venous side. The decreas¬
ing venous pressure is thought to deactivate the dominant pace¬
maker so that its rate decreases and reversal can occur. (Haywood
and Moon, 1953) A third theory suggests that reversal is caused
by an active competition between the two pacemaker regions to
control beat direction. Periodically, one end subdues the
other end by iniating beats at a higher frequency.
Although the research on the tunicate heart is exten¬
sive, there are certain areas in which it is deficient. For
instance, much of the work done so far has concentrated on
Ciona intestinalis and a few other species. Few inter-
species comparative studies on rates of beating and reversal
of the heart have been done. Also, much of the analysis has
been done on excised, cannulated hearts so that the natural.
in vivo heart patterns are not clearly defined for some species.
