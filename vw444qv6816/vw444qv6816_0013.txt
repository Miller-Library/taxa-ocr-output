no significant difference in the way procaine paralyzed animals'
hearts reacted to injury (even though there was no body con¬
traction) when compared with the reaction of unanesthetized
animals which had violent body contractions. (Figure 5)
Evidence for the pacemaker competition theory (Loeb, 1900)
came from observations of occasional reversals without the usually
associated decrease in heart rate. This suggests a more forcible
taking over of the heartbeat by the inactive pacemaker. A
more dramatic example of this is that, occasionally, bi¬
directional beats (beats that started at both ends of the heart
and collided in the middle) preceded reversals even in the
absence of beat slowing or any indication of "fatique". (Figure
bD and 6E) However, this type of reversal occurred so seldom
in comparison with the regular pattern that pacemaker compet-
ition must play a relatively limited role in regulating heart
reversals.
In summary, the most logical explanation for periodic
heartbeat reversal in Clavelina huntsmani is the presence
of an endogenous, number dependent regulatory mechanism or
counter, succeptible to modification by other influences such
as pacemaker competition, pressure changes, and possible ner¬
vous control. The existence of a number dependent reversal
regulator for more species of tunicates is also consistent with
the data in Table 1, where the number of heartbeats per period
has smaller inter-species differences than do reversal fre¬
quency or rate of heartbeat.
