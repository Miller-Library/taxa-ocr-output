he eggs were washed three times with sea water by
jecantation and resuspension. They were fertilized
addition of one or two drops of sperm suspension
one drop of sperm fluid in 10ml. sea water.) (1,3)
then transferred the embryos to small perti
dishes or flasks which contained sewage dilutions. SAt
different intervals they were examined microscopicall,
or general morphological attributes. To measure the
ate of skeleton growth, I removed a few drops from
each culture, placed them on a depression slide, and
added several drops of Clorox. After about a minute
the skeletons could be measured. I always measured th
distance from the top to the end of the postoral arm.
(Figure 1
To keep the temperature constant, I placed the
etri dishes on a tray which floated on the sea table
water. The temperature remained between 15 and 18Â°c.
Several times I changed the water in the petri dishes
of the older plutei. This was done by removing about
half the water with a syringe, avoiding the embryos,
and adding fresh water or dilutions of sewage. Daily
the plutei were fed one or two drops per petri dish
of algae from a culture obtained from Ralph Hine-
gardner. (These same algae are known to sustain sea
urchin embryos through netamorphosis. (4) Where
antiblotic solutions were used, streptomycin and pen-
cillen were added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml
The sewage was obtained from the Honterey treat
each.
