ment plant. The algae were grown in a medium which
was half the concentration described by Guillard and
Ryther. (2
ESUITS
The stages of development were defined in terms
of gross morphological changed. These are shown in
gures 2, 3, and 4. The first stages (71-14) are sim
lar to those described by Karnofsky and Simmel. (5)
The times of the first cleavages were not
effected by the sewage. No effects from sewage were
observed for about ten hours, after which retarded
development or abnormalities were seen in 5% and 10%
sewage. (Figures 5,6) The abnormal embryos were of
varying shapes and were darker than controls. They
didn't die, but remained approximately the same size
and continued to swim for several weeks
In one trial run using sand dollars I observed
that chlorinated sewage from Pacific Grove had a greater
effect than unchlorinated Nonterey sewage. Thus,
in a 10% dilution, the eggs never divided. In exper
iments with sea urchins and starfish gametes a relat-
vely low concentration of chlorine can completely block
fertilization. (7,9)
To determine the rate of development more
precisely, I measured the skeleton lengths. Embryos
grown in 14 sewage grew slightly faster than those in
sea water, but those in 5% and greater sewage dilutions
