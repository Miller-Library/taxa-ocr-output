ments to see if the groups were significantly different.
The skeletons from 14 sewage were statistically either
the same or longer than those from sea water. (In one
case they were shorter, however.) But after they had
been growing for 100 hours, the skeletons were longer
in the sea water controls. The embryos from 2% sewage
were never consistantly different from those in sea
water. (Figure 11)
My observations point to some experimental
conditions that must be kept constant in order to
observe sewage effects. First, the embryos should not
be too crowded. The type of container is significant.
The embryos died after a week in 125ml. flasks, but
hey survived in the petri dishes. Temperature and ph
must be constant. Addition of antibiotics did not
correlate with health or rate of development.
DISCUSSION
From my observations, I conclude tha concen-
trated sewage (5%) adversely effects the development
of embryos, but that lower concentrations may slightly
nhance growth, at least during the first 100 hours
The effects of temperature may also have
