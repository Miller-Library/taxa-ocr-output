INTRODUCTIO
For many years cities around the Monterey Bay
have been dumping their sewage into the ocean, but
no one has studied the biological significance of this

rate of development by timing morphological changes
and measuring lengths of skeletons. The sewage didn't
seem to harm the embryos in dilutions less than 5%.
In fact, they often grew slightly better in 1% sewage
than in sea water. However, development was either
slower or abnormal in 5g and greater sewage concen-
trations. Several other factors, including the temp-
erature, type of container, concentration of embryos,
and natural variation of eggs, were also found to effect
the rate of development.

he adult sand dollars and sea urchins were
ollected and kept in an aquarium with sea water and
aeration. Shedding of gametes was induced by intra-
coelemic injection of O.5M KCl. Eggs were collected
y setting the animal over a beaker filled with sea
water; sperm were collected "dry" with a pipett.
