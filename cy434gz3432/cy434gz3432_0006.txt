significance in field conditions. Thus, the temp.
erature around the outfall was found to be several degrees
higher. Also, the sewage contains organic and inorganic
nutrients which might be beneficial at low concentrations
explaining the initial slight enhancement in dilute
sewage. (8) Many factors, including various metals,
proteolytic enzymes, and dyes, are known to produce
exogastrulation, one of the abnormalities found in 5/
sewage. (5,6) The sewage may certainly contain some
of these factors. The osmotic differences in the higher
sewage concentrations may also have caused retardation.
Finally, the chlorine probably has strong effects. In
comparing development and fertilization, the latter is
a more sensitive process, particularly to chlorine.
Working with Pateria, Rotkis found that once eggs were
fertilized, they reached the blastula stage, a result
which agrees with my data. (9) However, though the
embryos look normal, are all the systems working properly'
Will embryos raised in sewage be able to undergo meta-
morphosis? These questions suggest further research.
SUMIART
The effects of sewage on sand dollar and sea
urchin development were studied. Time required to reach
different morphological stages and rate of skeleton
growth were used as parameters. Studies were also
arried out on culture conditions necessary to raise
embryos beyond the pluteus stage. The development was
