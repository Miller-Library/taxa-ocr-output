The estimated error for voltage readings is se= .002 for both trans¬
ducers.
Manometer
Manometry was used to estimate the lift force on the model. An
inverted, sloped manometer (Vogel, 1981) was filled with corn oil with
a measured density of p =.912 10° kg m23. One pressure probe was
stationary beneath the fish on the lateral line. The second probe
measured the constant mainstream water pressure. Values were recorded
for flat and fins up postures. For more information on manometry,
see Vogel, Life in Moving Fluids.
Inclined Plane
Static friction coefficients, M., were measured with an inclined
plane apparatus (figure 4). Values were calculated from an average
angle of slippage, 6, using the equation - tan 0. (This is
g. - mg sin e and Fy = mg cos 0. Sub¬
derived from Fg - Fy. E
stitution results in P= tan 0.) The plane had an acrylic plastic
surface to mimic the flow tank floor and all measurements were made
while the apparatus was submerged in sea water.
Experimental Procedure
The rheotactic behavior of live sand dabs was observed in the flow
tank, with careful note of current velocities. Fish were centered in
the tank and oriented in the desired direction. Speeds were increased
in 5 cm s4 increments with a minimum of 5 minutes between changes.
