Manometry
The pressure difference between the flat posture and the fins
up posture was measured to be AP = 2.59 N m2. For a plan area
A = 7.5 10 Â° m2 the lift reduction from the fins up posture was
thus predicted to be F = .019 N.
Static Friction Coefficient
Sand dabs freshly anesthitized in MS 222 had a calculated static
friction coefficient of M-.30. This value is similar to that of
freshly killed plaice where M, -.2 to .4 (Arnold and Weihs, 1978).
A, for the model was much higher due to the nature of the silicone
rubber and perhaps, the absence of mucus. Values averaged M,=.84
for the flat posture and M,- .75 for the fins up posture.
DISCUSSION
Lift and Drag
Simple observation suggests that sand dab rheotaxis alters the
interaction of drag and lift: A model in the fins up posture slips at
35 cm s+ while the same model in the flat posture slips at 30 cm s 1.
An anesthetized fish slips around 20 cm s1,
Hydrodynamic analysis supports this conjecture. The lift reduction
produced by the fins up posture increases the effective weight, W, and
thereby frictional force. Since the drag force is unchanged the fish
effectively postpones slippage (figure 12). From equation (5), the
model in the flat posture with head to tail flow, U. - 20.7 cm s'i
