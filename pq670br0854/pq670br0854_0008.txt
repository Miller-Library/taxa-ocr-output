dab delays the separation point and results in relatively low pressure
drag (Blake, 1983). Blake, 1983 suggests that for a streamlined object
most of the drag is a result of skin friction drag.
Total drag force can be calculated from the equation
Fa - 1/2 Ca.Ap U2
where F, is the total drag froce, C the drag coefficient,? the density
of sea water, Ag the plan area and U is the flow speed. When the
total drag force exceeds the frictional force the fish can no longer
remain in place and slips downstream. The slippiay threshold can be
calculated from the equation
Fa -MsW,
(2)
where Lis the static friction coefficient and W is the effective
weight of the fish.
Since the streamline shape of the sand dab is also an aerfoil, a
lift force is created. This force directly opposes the submerged weight
(figure 7) such that
W - Wo - Fy.

where W, is the submerged weight and Fj is the lift force. The lift
force is defined as
Fi - 1/2 C(.Ap U2,

where Cj is the lift coefficient.
Combining equations 1-4 one can solve for the slipping velocities,
