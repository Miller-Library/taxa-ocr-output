SUMMARY
(1) Sand dabs exibit a behavioral response to flow.
(2) The rheotactic response is characterized by the fins up posture
where posterior anal and dorsal fins are raised, the body arches in
this same region, a water channel is created on the dorsal side, and
there is a slight upward cambering the length of the body.
(3) This posture change reduces lift by a factor of four, while drag
forces are unchanged. The result is an increased slipping velocity.
(4) The slipping velocity prediction for live sand dabs suggests that
either a) M.is larger or highly variable for the live fish. b) the
drag force and coefficients are slightly high. c) the observed slip¬
ping velocities are too high, a result of the velocity gradient of
the flow tank.
(5) Drag and lift coefficients are not constant over a Reynolds number
range of Re = 104 to Re = 105.
(6) For head to tail flow the fins up posture is hydrodynamically favor¬
able. For opposite flow the flat posture is the most effective. The
sand dab feels essentially equal forces in either flow direction.
(7) The proposed mechanism for lift reduction is an increase in flow
beneath the body thereby decreasing the pressure beneath the fish.
