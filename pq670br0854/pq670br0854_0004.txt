The model was 17.1 cm. in length and slightly more dense than the
live fish (P = 1.062 10° kg m2). The blotted mass was m = 48.7g
and the submerged mass m,- 1.8 g. Maximum width measured from anal to
dorsal fin was w - 8.3 cm.
Transducers
Twotransducers were used to measure forces on the model sand dab,
Both the drag and lift transducers were made of acrylic plastic and
designed to rest in the top portion of the flow tank (figures 2 and 3).
The model was attached to a double-cantilever beam. Any force applied
to the model resulted in a proportional displacement of the beam. These
displacements were sensed by a linerly variable differential transformer
and recorded on a voltmeter. After weight calibration the drag trans¬
ducer had a linear regression line with the equation F, = 1.180 V - .002,
r 7 .999 where Fy is the drag force and V is the voltage reading. The
lift transducer yielded the equation Fj = 2,25 V + .002, also with r».999;
Fj is the lift force. Since measured lift forces approached zero the
adjusted equation Fj = 2.32 V was used for voltage readings less than
or equal to.008 V.
The model was mounted to the moveable beam with a screw to allow
easy removal and posture adjustments. When attached to the transducers
and lowered into the tank, the model was inverted with its ocular side
down.
Use of the transducers required velocity adjustments due to the
constriction of flow by the transducer. The speed adjustment for the
drag transducer was U = 1.27 U, and U = 1.25 U, for the lift transducer.
Uo is the original mainstream velocity and U is the adjusted velocity.
