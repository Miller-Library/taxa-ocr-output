MATERIALS AND METHODS
Flow Tank
Experimentation was done in a flow tank similar to that described
by Vogel and LaBarbera, 1978 (figure 1). A constant flux of sea water
kept the temperature in a range of 13 to 15 C. Tlow speeds reached 106
cms. These mainstream speeds were measured by timing fluorescein dye
over a one meter distance.
Live Fish
Sand dabs were caught with hook and line and kept in a sandy bottom
holding tank, receiving a constant supply of sea water. The temperature
was 10 to 12Â°C. The sand dabs were fed freshly killed fish three times
weekly. Fish length ranged from 16.5 to 21.0 cm. The fish densities
were calculated from the equation (where mis the mass in air,
mthe submerged mass and o is the density of sea water. The average
fish density was 9-1.055 x 10 kg m-3.
Model Fish
Models were made of silicone rubber imbedded with wire for rigidity,
A sand dab was killed in a water bath containing a high concentration
of MS 222, resulting in minimal physical alterations of the fish. The
fins were carefully spread and pinned down, and the fish was then frozen.
Parafin wax was poured over the prepared fish forming the mould. A
layer of silicone rubber was applied, followed by five wires and the
final layer of rubber. Aluminum foil fins backed by fine wire were
used to replicate dorsal and anal fins.
