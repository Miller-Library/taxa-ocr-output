reduction is hypothesized to be increased flow speed beneath the sand
dab. The flow originates primarily from water channels along the dorsal
and anal fins. The raised fins serve as the outlet channel where water
exits from beneath the body. Fluorescein dyes used to study currents
support this theory.
A manometer confirms the increased flow during the fins up posture
The measured drop in force of F =.019 N during the fins up posture is
evidence of a decrease in pressure beneath the fish. From Bernoulli's
principle it follows that flow velocity must increase. So the rheotaxis
is merely a hehavioral reaction to reduce lift by increasing flow beneath
the body.
The manometer result of F =.019 N is less than the transducer
measurement of F - .025 N for lift reduction from the fins up posture.
The difference is explained by rough manometer procedure. Only one
point beneath the fish was measured, that being under the arched section
on the lateral line. This point is posterior to the center of lift and
should theoretically yield a smaller value.
The sand dab has developed a clever hehavior to increase slip
speed for head to tail flows. But wave surge is bidirectional. To
remain in place on the bottom with flow from tail to head, the sand dab
doesn't raise his fins. C =.014 for the flat position. This value
is not significantly different from the Cq -.016 calculated for the
fins up posture in head to tail flow.. Sand dabs theoretically could
combat the bidirectionality of wave surge then, by subtle changes in
posture. For head to tail flow the fins up posture is best and for
the reverse flow the flat posture is most advantageous. Since no single
flow direction is hydrodynamically preferred, the sand dabs can avoid
constant reorientation to changing flow directions.
