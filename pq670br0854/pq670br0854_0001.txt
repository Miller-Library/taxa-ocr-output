ABSTRACT
Pacific Sand dabs exibit postural change when introduced to flow,
The rheotaxis and the underlying hydrodynamics are not well studied for
flatfish. No known values for lift or drag exist. In this study force
transducers were used to measure drag and lift on the sand dab, and
corresponding drag and lift coefficients were calculated. The lift is
remarkably variant with altered posture anddrag is virtually unchanged.
It is this four fold lift reduction for head to tail flow that enables
the sand dabs to stay in place in currents up to 402 to 50% faster,
The sand dab is equally efficient with flows in the opposite direction;
this is essential to accommodate the bidirectional surge. A mechanism
for lift reduction, or more importantly for increased slipping velocity,
is proposed.
INTRODUCTION
The Pacific Sand dab, Citharichthys sordidus is a bottom dweller
in ocean depths from 30 feet to 1600 feet. The flatfish is well designed
for sea floor inhabitation and would prefer to stay camouflaged on the
bottom. At depths of 30 feet with wave height of 10 feet and a period of
10 seconds, wave surge can reach surprising velocities of V = 150 cm s-l.
Surge of this magnitude means sand dabs are exposed to significant flows
with dislodging potential. Sand dabs exibit a rheotaxis or reaction
to water flows in an attempt to withstand larger flow speeds. Arnold,
