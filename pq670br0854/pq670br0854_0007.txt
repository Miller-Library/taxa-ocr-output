cambering along the length of the body. Also the fins up posture
creates a water channel along the length of the dorsal side. The flow
originates from a small adjustment of an anterior portion of the
dorsal fin. A natural channel exists on the ventral side. This channel
results from the inability of the anal fins to contact the substrate.
This posture is the most intruiging behavior as these changes cause
significant flow redirection enabling the fish to stay stationary longer.
Flows moving from tail to head elicit a different series of reactions
from the sand dabs. No burying movements are observed and the fins up
posture is never noted. Some fish also slip slightly sooner when flow
moves from tail to head. Neither arching nor cambering is observed
as the flat posture appears most beneficial for remaining in place.
THEORY
Hydrodynamics
Rheotaxis suggests that as flows increase fish alter their posture
to postpone slippage. Sand dabs orient randomly when placed in the
flow tank and with the initiation of flow, do not appear to prefer one
flow direction to the other. Arnold and Weihs, 1978 theorize that the
head to tail flow is hydrodynamically advantageous based on the decreased
drag force on the streamlined body. But lift force is probably greatest
in this orientation, and the resultant slipping speed is an intricate
balance between these two forces.
The current initiates a drag force on the fish in the direction
of flow. This drag is the sum of pressure drag and skin friction drag.
