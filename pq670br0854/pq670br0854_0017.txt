Figure 1. Flow tank made of PVC pipe and acrylic plastic. The
filters are used to facilitate laminar flow. See Vogel and LaBarbera,
1978.
Figure 2. Drag transducer. The model is attached to a double¬
cantilever beam. Any force acting on the model results in displace¬
ment of the beam, and is recorded by the linearly variable differential
transformer.

Figure 4. Inclined plane apparatus used to measure the frictional
coefficient of live and model fish.
Figure 5. Sand dab reactions to flow.
Figure 6. Fins up posture. Characterized by raised fins, arched
body, dorsal side water channels, and an upward cambering of the
body.

Figure 10. The lift coefficient is not constant. Postural change
results in a drammatic change in the lift coefficient.

Figure 11. Drag is unchanged with flow direction and posture. Lift
shows signigicant change with both flow and posture.
