Similar observations were recorded for the model sand dab.
Transducer measurements varied with model shape and distance from
transducer. Precautions were taken to consistently mimic the rheotactic
response with the model. It was found necessary to remove all air
bubbles trapped between the model and the transducer apparatus.
The drag transducer was tested with a 1/2 inch in diameter cylinder.
The drag coefficient was C = 0.58. Recorded values for similar shaped
cylinders are C = 0.48 to Cq = 0.75 (Hoerner, 1965).
BEHAVIOR
Sand dab Rheotaxis
Sand dabs undergo a remarkable series of behaviors when introduced
to flow (figure 5). When no flow exists sand dabs typically settle on
the tank bottom, head raised up to 2 cm off the substrate. As head to
tail flow begins the head is lowered. With increasing flow most fish
commence burying movements. This behavior consists of rapid body un¬
dulations coordinated with anal and dorsal fin beating. In addition
to being used as a settling device while on sand, it appears to help
extrude water from beneath the fish. This results in increased surface
area in contact with the substrate. The burying movements seem to ac¬
complish results similar to the "posterior fin-beating response" described
by Arnold, 1969.
As flow increases, dorsal and anal fins are raised into a fins up
posture (figure 6). This entails a characteristic raising of the poster¬
ior portion of the anal and dorsal fins. This is coupled with a notice¬
able body arch directly above the posterior region and a slight upward
