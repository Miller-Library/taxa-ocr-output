Since C, and C, have never been quantitatively determined for sand
dabs, only rough comparisons can be made to shapes of known coefficients
(figure 14). Drag of an asymmetric semi-ellipsoid body with its blunt
end facing the flow depends on its fineness ratio or ratio of length
to thickness. For minimum drag the optimum value is between 10 to 15
(Blake, 1983). For sand dabs the ratio is between 12 and 13. The
corresponding minimum drag coefficient is C, -.03 for the semi-ellipsoid
body. Drag coefficients for the model sand dab range from C = ,O1
to C -.045.
Arnold and Weihs, 1978 estimated Cj and C, for plaice (Pleuronectes
platessa L. ) and concluded that C was 10 to 20 times Cq. But in
doing so it is necessary to assume that  is constant for Re » 10',
This assumption is invalid for sand dabs as both Cq and C vary over a
small Reynolds number range of Re = 104 to Re = 10°. The sum is also
not constant. The actual ratio of lift to drag in sand dabs is 1/10 th
that theorized for plaice.
A partial explanation for the difference stems from basic geometry.
The plaice has a larger aspect ratio, ratio of width to length, than
does the sand dab. However the former results in increased lift (Blake,
1983). This accounts for a fraction of the ten fold difference. The
remaining difference is most probably due to the assumption of a constant
- value. Empirical evidence (figures 9 and 10) shows this assump¬

tion to be invalid in sand dabs and perhaps flat fish in general.
Lift Reduction Mechanism
It is well substantiated that rheotaxis reduces lift force, and
therefore increases the slipping velocity. The mechanism behind lift
