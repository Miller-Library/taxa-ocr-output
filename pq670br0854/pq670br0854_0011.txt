(Cg and C, values at Reynolds number Re = 6.5 «10“ , the approximate
slipping velocity of U = 30 cm s1). For the same flow direction in
the fins up posture Ug = 26.8 cm s1.
Is the model a good simulation of live sand dabs? Plotting
frictional force and drag force as a function of flow speed (from
equation (5) with Mg-.30 for the live sand dab) U - 16.6 cm si
(figure 13). This value is one-half the value observed. The low
prediction is explained in three ways. (1) g was calculated for
anesthitized fish and found to be Us -.30. It is likely that
conscious fish can physically increase  through fin use and general
body conformation. As already mentioned, burying movements increase
surface area in contact with the substrate, and perhaps increases the
value of A.. This directly increases frictional force and delays
movement. (2) Although the model is a good replica of sand dab shape
it does lack mucus. Daniel, 1981 reported that skin friction can be
reduced up to 502 in turbulent or pulsed laminar flows. Since skin
friction is an important component of total drag in streamline objects,
mucus is likely to decrease total drag. A decreased drag means an
increased U.. Together, these two changes could shift the slipping
speed into the observed range. (3) The observed slipping velocity
may also be at fault. The flow tank creates a substantial boundary
layer. The measured mainstream flow was the value observed at the
slipping speed. The actual flow speed acting on the fish is less than
mainstream flow due to this velocity gradient. Hence, the observed
U. is greater than the calculated value from equation (5).
