obtainable. U, can then be calculated and compared to the observed
values. This serves as a check for the C and C, calculations.
Since lift and drag forces increase by the square of the flow
velocity, a small flow increase results in a large combination of forces
acting on the fish. If the sand dab wishes to remain stationary, any
posture change that can reduce either lift or drag force is quite ad¬
vantageous.
RESULTS
Lift and Drag
The fins up posture results in a significant reduction in lift
force (figure 8). The decline in lift is roughly 4 fold at all
velocities. The drag force is not significantly changed by altered
posture. The lift force is on the average, two times that of the drag
force in the flat posture at all flow speeds. However with the fins
up, the calculated lift is one half that of the drag force.
Lift and Drag Coefficients
The calculated drag and lift coefficients both vary over the
Reynolds number range of 10’ to 10°. No substantial change in C
resulted from a change in posture (figure 9). C on the other hand,
dropped drammatically during the fins up posture to nearly 25% of
the flat posture value (figure 10).
Flow direction had no effect of C at a speed of U - 30 cm s i
(approximate slipping speed) (figure 11). C however, shows substantial
change with flow direction.
