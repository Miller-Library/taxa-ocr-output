1969 observed similar behavior in plaice and Arnold and Weihs, 1978
studied the hydrodynamic factors underlying the rheotaxis in plaice.
Empirically measured values of lift and drag force, and in particular
the lift and drag coefficients, remain unknown for flatfish. The
combination of streamline and aerfoil shapes make sand dabs a unique
hydrodynamic study, and proves to help explain the function of the
rheotaxis.
