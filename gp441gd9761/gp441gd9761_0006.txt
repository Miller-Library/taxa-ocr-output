months old at death. Both readily accepted fish which were offered to
them. Each could have taken up DDT from its mother's bloodstream
while still in the womb, from the mother's milk, and from fish which
it may have caught itself.
The DDE levels found in this analysis are some of the highest
reported to date. Risebrough found 3.3 ppm total DDT residues in the
liver of a Brandt's cormorant (1967), 211 ppm total DDT residues in
the fat of a Western gull (1967), and 59.3 ppm total DDT residues in
the whole body of an Ashy petrel (1969). Most of the birds used in
my analysis were extremely emaciated, having little or no body fat.
This suggests that they had been sick for a prolonged period before
death and were unable to feed. This in turn suggests chronic poisoning
or illness. As the fat was used up while the birds were alive, the DDT
residues contained in the fat would have been released and deposited in
other areas of the body. This would have caused the levels I found in
the livers to be higher than if the birds still had a normal amount of
body fat.
Some of these DDE levels probably approach or exceed lethal doses.
No conclusive statement can be made, however, until IDgo's are
determined for the species analysed. In addition, DDT levels in birds
collected in Monterey Bay while still alive would be valuable.
