Great differences in DDT levels can be obtained from different
organs within the same animal (e.g., Keith and Hunt, 1966). The liver
provides a good general index of DDT level and was chosen for analysis
in this study. Whole livers were homogenized before sub-samples were
taken to insure a random sample of the liver. One sample of sub-
cutaneous fat of a loon was used, and a mature ovary of another loon
was used. Duplicate samples were run on the livers of the first two
birds analysed, a cormorant and a gull, in order to check the
reproducibility of the method. These duplicate samples deviated by
less than 10%; thereafter only one sample from each tissue was analysed.
Samples were digested and extracted using the method of Stanley and
LeFavoure (1965), and were analysed quantitatively for DDT and its
analogs with a Beckman GC h gas-liquid chromatograph using a 3 OF 1
column on 80-100 mesh chromosorb W and an electron capture dector. All
chemicals and glassware were checked for possible DDT contamination.
DDE is the only analog reported because the chromatograph
column was unable to separate the DDT and DDD peaks sufficiently from the
DDE peak to be accurately quantitated. In all cases, however, the
combined DDT and DDD concentrations were insignificant in relation
to the DDE concentrations.
