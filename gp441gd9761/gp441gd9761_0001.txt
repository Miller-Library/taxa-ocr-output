Casual observations by bird watchers in the Monterey Bay area
have indicated an increase in the number of dead birds found along the
beaches during the past year. During the time period of September, 1968.
to May, 1969, regular walks along a stretch of beach near Moss Landing in
Monterey Bay were conducted by James Norris of the Moss Landing Marine
Laboratories in an attempt to d√©termine rate and cause of deaths of birds.
Preliminary results of these walks are that, oflO birds found, 37%
were oil-covered, 11% were shot, and 49% died of unknown causes.
Monterey Bay is situated in an agricultural region where a great
amount of pesticides is used. Parathion (o,o-diethyl o,p-nitrophenyl
phosphorothioate) is the major pesticide used in Monterey County, with
DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane ranking second.
During the past fifteen years at least 125,000 pounds of technical grade
DDT has been used each year, sprayed on lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower,
and young tomatoes (Scott, 1969). The Monterey Bay area is drained
