Results and Discussion:
The results of the analysis are summarized in Table I.
Since the Brandt's cormorant, the Western grebe, and the Arctic
loon are reported to feed mainly on fish and small amounts of
crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic insects and plants (Palmer, 1962).
it might be expected that their levels of DDT residues be approximately
the same. This is not the case. A possible explanation of the
variations among the three species could be differences in ability
to metabolize and excrete DDE. Differences could also be related to
migratory habits.
Map I (Palmer, 1962) shows the migratory routes of the cormorant,
grebe, and loon. The cormorant is a permanent resident of the west
coast of the United States, and is constantly exposed to high pollution.
The Western grebe winters on the west coast, but breeds in the summer
months in fresh water lakes in the northern United States. Many lakes
are contaminated with DDT from insect control spraying, and grebes
feeding there will ingest food which is possibly more contaminated
than on the west coast. The Arctic loon winters on the west coast.
but breeds north of the Arctic Circle. DDT levels are probably low
this far north, explaining the low levels in the loons.
The much higher level of DDE in the sub-cutaneous fat of the loon
as opposed to the liver of the same bird shows the insecticide's
tendency to concentrate in lipid-rich tissues. The loons were the only
birds analysed which contained sub-cutaneous fat. This may be another
explanation for the low DDE values in their livers, since much of their
