The loon ovary analysed was much lower in DDE than the liver of the
same bird. This agrees with the findings of Keith and Hunt (1966).

and other materials floating on the surface of the water (Palmer, 1962).
The surface of the water receives the aerial fallout of insecticide and
has unique physical-chemical properties which could enable it to
temporarily retain the water-insoluble chlorinated hydrocarbon components
(Risebrough, 1969). This may account for the extremely high DDE levels
in the two petrels.
The large variation in DDE concentrations in the two gulls may be
explained by their feeding habits. Gulls are opportunistic feeders, and
eat almost anything from garbage to fish. Their DDE levels may be
largely a function of where they feed and what they feed on. Differing
migratory habits may also be a factor in causing the different levels in
the two gulls. Map II (Robbins, Bruun, and Zim, 1966) shows the
migratory routes of the two gulls. The Western gull is a permanent
resident of the west coast, but the Ring-billed gull breeds during the
summer months in mountain lakes of southern Canada, where there may be
less DDT pollution than on the west coast.
The differences in DDE levels in the two sea lions may be explained
by the way they obtained their food before dying. The Steller sea lion
had been born prematurely, so its only source of DDT was through the
placenta from the mother. The California sea lions were at the stage of
being weaned from their mothers. The larger one had been tagged by
biologists of the University of California at Santa Cruz and was eleven
