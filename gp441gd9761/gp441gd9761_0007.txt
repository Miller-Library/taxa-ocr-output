Summary:
Pesticidal pollution of Monterey Bay, California has been
suggested as the cause of an unusually large number of bird deaths
reported in the past year. Analyses were performed on a series of
dead or dying birds and mammals taken from the Monterey Bay area.
Concentrations of DDT and its analogs DDD and DDE were determined by
gas chromatography. Results were as follows: 107, 105, and 155 ppm
DDE in livers of three Brandt's cormorants; 192 and 292 ppm DDE in
livers of two Western grebes; 2.35 ppm DDE in the liver and 121 ppm DDE
in the sub-cutaneous fat of an Arctic loon; 1.25 ppm DEE in the liver
and O.61 ppm DDE in the ovary of a second Arctic loon; 373 ppm DDE in
the liver of a Fork-tailed petrel; 112 ppm DDE in the liver of an
Ashy petrel; 805 ppm DDE in the liver of a Western gull; hl.5 ppm DDE
in the liver of a Ring-billed gull; 1.2 ppm DDE in the liver of an aborted
Steller sea lion pup; and 3.94 and 89 ppm DDE in the livers of two
immature California sea lions.
