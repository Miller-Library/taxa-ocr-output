extensively by the Salinas River, the Pajaro River, and Elkhorn Slough.
Early in 1969 heavy rains caused the Salinas River to flood low-lying
farmlands in the Salinas Valley, and it almost certainly leached
quantities of pesticides from the soil, which were carried by the river
into Monterey Bay.
Many of the birds and mammals of Monterey Bay are fish-eaters.
Pesticides are transferred and concentrated in organisms as the food
chain is ascended and may reach the fish-eating birds and mammals at
the end of the food chain in high concentrations. Studies by Risebrough
(1967, 1969), Wurster (1968), and Keith and Hunt (1966) have indicated
the high levels of pesticides and their adverse effects on birds and
other California wildlife.
In order to determine whether the bird deaths were caused by
contamination with DDT residues, selected birds and mammals of
Monterey Bay were examined for concentrations of DDT and its analogs
DDD 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)ethane and DDE1,1-dichloro-
2,2-bis (chlorophenyl)ethene
Materials and Methods:
A list of birds and mammals analysed and locations and dates of
collection is contained in Table I. Birds were collected by James Norris
of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, by Verne Yadon of the Pacific Grove
Museum of Natural History, and bymyself. The Steller sea lion was born
prematurely and found by Dr. G. Victor Morejohn of the Moss Landing
Laboratories; the larger California sea lion was found by Ralph Nonella
Resen
of the Pacific Grove Marine Refuge Unit; and the smaller California sea
lion was found by members of the Hopkins Marine Station.
