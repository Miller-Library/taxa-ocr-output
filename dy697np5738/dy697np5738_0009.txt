3. The first external indication of budding (stage B) is
the constriction of a single whole abdominal segment, usually
abdominal chaetiger seven, but the range observed includes
abdominal chaetigers six to thirteen. Red pigment is usually
concentrated along this segment.
4. In budding stage C, the rudiments of the primordial
tentacles appear and the setae and uncini are shed from the
future prostomium and peristomium.
5. The emergence of collar setae, the shedding of abdominal
setae on the first uncinigerous thoracic segment, and the growth
of new thoracic notosetae characterize stage D.
6. Abdominal segments are converted to thoracic segments by
a regular process: (a) Loss of abdominal uncini, (b) growth of
thoracic notosetae, (c) formation of thoracic uncini, and (d)
loss of original abdominal setae. Within each segment the new
thoracic setae are added starting at the ventral and proceeding
toward the dorsal side. Along the body of the bud, changes occur
first in the anterior segments and last in the posterior segments,
forming a gradient.
7. As each new thoracic segment completes its develppment
externally, the thoracic mantle extends to the completed segment.
8. Abdominal regeneration in the parent accompanies the above
development: At least a pygidium and three new chaetigers are
added before separation of bud and parent. Separation is accomÂ¬
panied by violent contractions localized at the junction of
parent and offspring. The guts of parent and offspring appear
to be functionally continuous until bud separation.
