DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
comparison, was smooth. Of eight animals tested, seven chose the marine
asbestos and one showed no movement toward either substrate; this result
was significantly different from random (p(.05; chi-squared test).
Glass plates of three textures were arranged in pairs as in the
previous experiment. The substrates tested were the three combinations of
smooth, semi-rough and rough glass adjacent to each other. Two adjoining
smooth plates served as a control (Table 1). The textural combinations of
glass substrata indicated no preference for a roughened substrate over a
smooth.
Modes of Attachment
Four factors possibly aid in pedal attachment of Anthopleura elegan-
tissima: 1) Nematocysts, 2) Substrate conformation, 3) Suction, and 4) Ad-
hesion.
Nematocysts
Frozen longitudinal sections 48 microns thick were cut from the pedal
disc of A. elegantissima with the International Cryostat, Model CTI. The
sections were then placed on slides and stained with neutral red for
histological observation. Fewer than twenty nematocysts were observed in
each of four complete sections. The nematocysts, all undischarged, were
found in the ectodermal, mesogloeal and gastrodermal tissues.
Forceful removal of an anemone from a glass slide left behind damaged
tissue which was investigated microscopically. An average of eight nema-
tocysts were found in each of sixteen random fields 144 microns in diameter.
with less than.7 nematocysts discharged per field. In contrast, an
anemone removed by tapping a glass slide left no remnant tissue behind.
Only two nematocysts were found in sixteen random fields of this preparation.
Individual anemonies were subjected to turbulent and still water condi-
