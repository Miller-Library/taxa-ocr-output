DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
taken with the aid of the apparatus of Figure 2. A film of the mucus was
spread between two perpendicular microscope slides by rubbing the pedal
disc across the base slide. Sea water was used as a comparison. Film
thickness of sea water and mucus was controlled by placing a constant
weight of 500 grams on the top slide for two minutes prior to measurement.
line connected the top slide to the plastic weight bag at the oppocite end
of a pulley system. The tensile strength of each film (surface area 6.45 cm*)
was recorded as the weight required to pull the top slide off the secured
base slide. Gram weight, in the form of water in the plastic bag (buret-
controlled), was then converted to units of tensile strength (force/unit area).
Recordings of tensile strength present means of 9025.88 dynes/cm for sea
water, and 10,994.23 dynes/cm for pedal mucus. This difference in the
means is significant (Student's t-test: p (.02).
DISCUSSION
A survey of local intertidal Anthopleura elegantissima revealed none
attached to loose gravel and shell fragments. Observations on abilities
of anemonies to attach to various substrates likewise demonstrated A. ele-
gantissima's inability to attach to a loose gravel-shell substrate. Success-
ful attachment to porous screen indicates that large scale suction involving
the pedal disc acting as a single raised cup does not occur. On screen,
the rim of the pedal disc is unable to maintain a pressure differential
due to the substrate's porousity. If suction is a mechanism in attachment,
the cups must be numerous and small, each in contact with an individual
strand of screen material.
Tests on selectivity of marine versus non-marine substrates suggest
that the chemical composition of the substrate is involved in preferential
attachment. The roughened texture of the marine over the non-marine
