DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
from the outer edges inward. The pedal disc was found to be composed of
tiny finite portions of tissue which stretched and snapped free as detach-
ment proceeded.
METHODS and RESULTS
Abilities to Attach to Various Substrates
Anthopleura elegantissima's capacity to attach to the following sub-
strates was tested: 1) Marine rock, 2) Cemented gravel and shell fragments
(cemented in paraffin wax), 3) Loose gravel and shell fragments, and 4) Porous
screen (3 meshes/mm). Anemonies of the same clone were used to prevent
genetic variations and possible aggresion. The anemonies were placed upside-
down on each substrate in aquaria supplied with running sea water. Recorded
was the time elapsed until the anemone was attached in an upright position.
The eight Anthopleura elegantissima on marine rock settled most rapidly,
with a range of seven to thirty-five minutes in attachment time. The four
anemonies on the cemented gravel-shell substrate ranked second in settling
ability, the range being one and one-half to four hours. Settlement on
the screen also occured, although the attachment time was longer, extending
from forty-five minutes to ten hours for eight anemonies tested. None of
the four anemonies on the loose gravel-shell substrate were able to attach.
Substrate Selection
Submerged anemonies were placed along the line of contact of two
rectangular plates of differing materials. The substrate selected by an
anemone was taken as the material on which it was found after twelve hours.
First considered was the choice of marine versus non-marine substrata.
Two asbestos plates were used, one soaked for several months in the inter-
tidal waters, and the second unsoaked. The intertidal asbestos appeared
roughened by the build-up of organic materials. The unsoaked asbestos, by
