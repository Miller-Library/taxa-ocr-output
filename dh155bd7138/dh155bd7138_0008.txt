DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
that pedal mucus is significantly more cohesive a substance than sea water.
Considering the subprocesses of cohesion and adhesion in attachment, a more
cohesive material can create a firmer attachment, adhesive and substrate
effects held constant. As different thicknesses of film create different
strengths of cohesion, optimal spacing of the pedal disc and its mucus rela-
tive to the substrate may be operating in attachment. Such substrate con-
formation in adhesion may therefore play a dominant role in attachment,
SUMMARY
1) Four factors possibly aid in pedal attachment of Anthopleura elegantis-
sima: 1) Nematocysts, 2) Substrate Conformation, 3) Suction, and 4) Ad-
hesion.
2) The pedal disc mucus is significantly more cohesive a substance than
sea water.
3) Optimal spacing of the pedal disc and mucus in substrate conformation and
adhesion may play a dominant role in attachment.
4) Large scale suction involving the pedal disc acting as a single raised
cup does not occur.
5) The pausity of nematocysts in the pedal disc suggests that their role in
attachment can only be minor.
The chemical composition of the substrate may be involved in preferenÂ¬
6)
tial attachment.
