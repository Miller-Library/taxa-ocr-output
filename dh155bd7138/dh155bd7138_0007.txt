DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
material may also indicate the anemone's preference for an irregular
substrate providing a large surface area for maximum pedal substrate con-
formation. Microscopic observations of the base of anemonies settled to
screen support the theory of substrate conformation as an attachment
mechanism.
Studies of substrate preference utilizing degrees of roughened glass
appear to de-emphasize the importance of substrate conformation. The tex-
tural combinations of glass substrata indicated no preference for a roughened
substrate over a smooth. Glass being an artificial substrate for an anemone,
selection behavior cannot be considered analogous to behavior on natural
substrates.
The abundance of nematocysts in the anemone's tentacles and verrucae
relative to the few observed in sections and scrapes suggests that the
role of nematocysts is minor in the pedal disc. Subjected to turbulent
water, the tentacles have the capacity to initiate the attachment process,
The pedal disc, however, did not initiate attachment in the thirty-six
observed trials. While these studies cannot negate the involvement of
nematocysts in pedal attachment, it appears that their role in attachment
can only be minor. The pausity of nematocysts in the pedal disc tends to
support the concept of their minor importance.
Suction, as an attachment mechanism in A. elegantissima, is an un-
answered question. If musculature is involved in creating suction, and if
a calcium-free solution relaxes all musculature, the anemone would be
expected to release if suction is solely involved. Substrate conformation
cannot be operating on a smooth glass plate. The firm attachment does not
exclude suction as a mechanism, but suggests that suction alone cannot be
operating in attachment.
Studies on the cohesiveness of pedal disc mucus and sea water demonstrate
