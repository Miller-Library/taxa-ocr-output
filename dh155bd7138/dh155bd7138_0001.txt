DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
INTRODUCTTON
Ellis, Ross and Sutton (1969) demonstrated evidence for an adhesive
mucus substance on the pedal disc of the swimming anemone Stomphia coccinea.
Settling is apparently associated with the expulsion and discharge of adhe-
sive nematocysts of the pedal disc (microbasic p-mastigophores).
No previous study has been published on the mode of attachment of
Anthopleura elegantissima. I herein report on experimental findings pertaining
to mechanisms of its attachment.
GENERAL LABORATORY OBSERVATIONS
The muscular apparatus for locomotion, as described by Pantin (1952)
for Metridium, is essentially the same as that responsible for peristaltic
waves in the column. According to Pantin, a wave of contraction of circuÂ¬
lar ectodermal muscle-fibres runs assymetrically inward from the rear edge
of the foot, causing release of the substratum. At the same time, down-
ward peristalsis in the column forces water into the foot causing expansion
there. The front edge of the foot thus advances after the pedal wave has
traveled across it.
In this investigation, an animal was placed on its side in a water-
filled glass dish. Verrucal and minor pedal disc attachment were observed.
The tentacles displayed sweeping movements across the substrate, and some
apparently attached to the glass. Different lobe-like portions of the
pedal disc became affixed to the glass as the anemone assumed an erect
posture.
Detachment was observed with the aid of the dissecting microscope
adjusted such that the animal was seen from below. Tapping the substratum
with a blunt instrument induced the pedal disc to peel off gradually
