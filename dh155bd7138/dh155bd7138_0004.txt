DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
tions to compare modes and rates of attachment. The apparatus simulating
turbulence consisted of a siphon delivering two liters of sea water per
minute into the base of a round plastic 500 ml container. The container,
open at the top, was in a constant state of overflow and caused the experiÂ¬
mental animal to be continually tossed and turned. The still water environ-
ment was established by converting a similar plastic container into a
revolving drum. Oriented sideways and connected to a small motor, the con-
tainer revolved smoothly at 1.2 rpm. Water and anemone entered and left
through a corked hole at one end of the otherwise sealed drum. Attachment
time was recorded, time O being that time the anemone, dropped into the
water of each container. Attachment time was defined as the time at which
continuous attachment was observed for a minimum of ten seconds. In the
revolving drum, an anemone attached when it stuck to the side wall, revolving
with it.
In the turbulent environment, the anemone's mode of attachment was
difficult to ascertain due to the rapid tossing and tumbling action of the
animal. Attachment was accomplished entirely by the tentacles or by the
side of the anemone (Tentacles: 40%; Side: 60%; n - 36). Side attach-
ment may have involved tentacles, verrucae, pedal disc, or a combination
of the three. The pedal disc never served as the sole site of attachment
in the turbulent water environment. In the still water conditions of the
revolving drum, each animal fell to the bottom oriented on its side with
the plastic wall of the container moving slowly underneath. No tossing or
turning of anemone was observed. In a side orientation, the surface area
of verrucae in contact with the substrate far exceeds that of the tentacles
or pedal disc. The attachment rate of anemone is dramatically faster in
the still water environment than in the turbulent, as demonstrated in
Figure 1.
