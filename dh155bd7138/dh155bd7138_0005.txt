DeMont: Attachment in Anthopleura elegantissima
Substrate Conformation
Pedal disc tissue of A. elegantissima both molded to and wrapped
around individual fibers of the 3 mm mesh screens. Random movement of
suspended particles inside the molded lobes of pedal disc was observed
with the aid of a microscope.
Submersion of an attached anemone in calcium-free sea water for
several hours relaxes all musculature (Ross, 1960 and Williams, 1975). Des-
pite such relaxation, the anemone maintains firm attachment.
Suction
In a suction cup mechanism on smooth substrate, contraction at the
rim conceivably draws the center of the cup up from the substrate, reducing
the inner pressure relative to that of the surroundings,
Anemonies attached firmly to glass plates were subjected to reduced
atmospheric pressures (-707 mm mercury) in a vacuum chamber. A submerged
anemone with a pedal surface area of 6.45 square em at a pressure of -707 mm
would theoretically require approximately 500 grams of weight to be hung
normal to it before detachment would occur. Such a calculation assumes
that perfect suction is involved in attachment.
One hundred grams of weight was hung normal to an inverted anemone of
pedal surface area 6.5 cm in such a vacuum. The weight hung from a thread
passing through the lower column. At the reduced pressure of -706 mm, firm
attachment was observed.
Adhesion
Indirect observations implying adhesion as a mode of attachment are
presented in earlier sections of the paper. The cohesive intermolecular
forces of mucus to mucus and adhesive forces of mucus to substrate are
sub-processes in such a mechanism of attachment (Nachtigall, 1974). Direct
comparison of the cohesive strength of pedal mucus and sea water was under-
