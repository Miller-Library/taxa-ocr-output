Females w/ Eggs vs. Females & Hales (Fig. 4) reveals that 5
males in tide pool water exposed to 0.5 grams crude oil survived 8 days
and when exposed to 1 gram of crude survived only 3 days. The group of 3
females with eggs and 2 females with no eggs exposed to 0.5 grams of
crude survived10 days. Females with and without eggs survived around 6
days when exposed to 1 gram of crude (weather or not they were in tidal or
filtered water or if the crude had first been weathered 3 days before
addition).
The Male and Female, 24hr Light, Mineral OII Cover (Fig. 5) is a
repetitive experiment in tide pool water that shows two sets of females
living 4 days, twice as long as the two sets of males that lived 2 days in
tide pool water.
In the Crude OiI Cover vs. Hineral Oil Cover in 24 hr Dark (Fig.
6) the life of animals in filtered sea H20 with a mineral oil cover in the
dark is almost triple that of the tide pool H20 with mineral oil samples.
Similarly, in the Crude & Mineral OII, 12hr Light/Dark Cycle (Fig. 7)
both the males and females survive almost twice the time 12-13 days
when covered with mineral oil if they are in filtered seawater.
Cleaning Reagents:
The addition of shoreline cleaners is often performed in con junction
with steam cleaning. Although steam was not tested with all the
solutions, boiling hot water added to a sample caused complete mortality
within 7 days (Fig. 10).
