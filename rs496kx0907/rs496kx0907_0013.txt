ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
would like to express infinite thanks to Alan Baldridge and Chuck
Baxter. I would also like to thank the companies who generously donated
their products; Texaco Inc, Exxon, Hydro-Tech, and A & V Inc. Thanks also
to Terri Shaw and the students of Bio 175H for their support and to the
copepods who gave their lives for my experiment.
