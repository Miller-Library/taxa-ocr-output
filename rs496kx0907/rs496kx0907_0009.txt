0.05ml Nokomis with or without Ig crude killed the samples by the 2nd
day. 0.00 Iml Nokomis with ig crude killed the sample in 6 days (one day
beyond just Ig crude) and the same amount without crude killed the
sample in 7 days.
Nutri-Bio 1000 (Fig. 14): O.0Iml of Nutri-Bio 1000 killed the
samples with or without Ig crude in at least 15 minutes. Ig crude and
0.001ml Nutri-Bio 1000 resulted it absolute mortality by the 4th day.
DISCUSSION.
I. californicus' survival is inversely proportional to the amount of
crude it is exposed to (Dorit 1977, Barnett and Kontogtannis 1975).
Figure 2 shows T californicus living about 10 days when exposed to 0.59
of crude and about 5 days when exposed to ig crude. When the oxygen
exchange was blocked by a 0.Sml crude oil cover the sample died within
4-5 days. When mineral oil was used (crude oil without impurities), total
mortality took 6-7 days (Fig. 7). These results are identical to the
findings of Barnett and Kontogiannis (1973) and reillustrate the fact that
I. californicus is affected by the physical as well as the toxic elements
of crude oil and that an experiment performed on S animals in Jml tide
pool water yields the same experimental results as tests on 50 animals in
20ml of tide pool water. The fact that T californicus survived about
twice the time, 12-13 days when covered with mineral ofl when they were
in filtered seawater (Fig. 7) is probably due to the lack of other oxygen
