2 adult females without eggs in 3ml of tide pool water (in a Sml jar), kept
in alternating 12hr light and dark cycles (normal indirect sunlight) at
15â€¢c.
The crude oil used in this experiment was provided by the Texaco Inc.
fields in San Ardo, California. This heavy, tar-like oil (sp. gr. 0.9799)
consisted of 75% naphthenes, 17.3% paraf fins, 6.5% aromatics and 2.27
sulphur (Texaco Inc. R1350 Crude 011). Weathered crude was prepared by
placing 60ml of San Ardo crude on 600ml sea water in an evaporat ing pan
exposed to sunlight and no rain. This oil was collected after 24 hours and
72 hours (1 and 3 days), losing 50% of its volume by evaporation in the
first 24hrs and 60% by the 3rd day (Wheeler 1978). Mineral oil was used
to examine the physical effects of crude oil in the absence of toxins since
mineral oil is essentially crude oil without impurities (Stecher, 1968).
When 0.5 ml crude or mineral oil were added to the samples, the oil
naturally positioned itself on the water surface, and blocked gas exchange
between the air and water. Otherwise, only 1 and 0.5 grams (about 0.1
and 0.0Sm1) of crude were weighed then added on the end of a toothpick (to
hold the substance in the water column and to prevent it from rising and
disturbing the surface gas exchange).
