the lcm* surface and 3ml of tide pool water in the samples. Since about
five US gallons per acre of Exxon's two open water dispersants Corexit
9527 and 9550 and MAR-LENS SLICK-A-WAY are normally added to spills,
after conversion, O.Iml of the solutions (about 2 drops) were added per
sample. A mixture of O.Iml Corexit 9527 diluted with 1Oml seawater was
also prepared, according to the reccomended use, and 0.Iml of this
solution was tested. 1.24 ml of Corexit 9580, a shoreline cleaner (one
gallon is normally added to 100 square feet in undilute form) was added to
the samples as well as a smaller amount, 0.Iml Corexit 9580. O.3m1
Corexit 7664 (normally added as a 1-3% solut ion to 10 to 15 square feet)
was also tested. 0.05 and 0.001mI NOKOMIS 3-F4 were tested, equivalent
to seawater dilutions of 1:15 and 1:100. Finally, O.0Iml and 0.001ml of
Nutri-Bio 1000 were also evaluated, equivalent to sea H20 dilut ions of
1:10 and 1:100.
RESULTS:
There were about 10 females (with no eggs) and 2 males per 5ml
bottle (about 2 antmals per mi) left in the splash pools overnight. In the
jars from the laboraory populat ion there were about 8 females (one with
egg) and 3 males per bottle (about 2 per ml). In my analyses of stressed
(small) high splash pools 1 found about 33 animals per 12m1 pool, 15 of
which were females with eggs, 15 females without eggs, 2 males, and
some small juvenile females, together averaging about 3 animals per ml.
