that are detrimental when combined with Corexit 7664 but the physical
properties that affect the organisms.
Further tests of cleaning reagents might include generat ional studies
where the organisms' fitness could be measured against the number of
eggs per clutch since when female T californicus are exposed to toxins
the number of eggs per clutch decreases (Vittor 1971 and observations).
An experiment that could analyze this without disturbing the organisms
would be an important measure of toxicity. Generational and
recolonization investigations could also be conducted if even smaller
fractions of the cleaning reagents were used on larger populations and
studied for a longer period of time.
If a spill cannot be prevented from reaching the shore, political haste
must not cause early or unnecessary cleansing since the natural
degradation of the oil and the cleaning of the surf are usually the best
cleaning options, both economically and environmentally (API, 1985).
Highly toxic cleaning reagents should not be used on living ecosystems and
should only be used post mortem if their negative effects can be shown not
to inhibit habitat restoration.
