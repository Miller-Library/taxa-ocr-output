has grown. So has the need to evaluate the ecological effects of the
current cleanup procedures beyond the anecdotal (Foster, Tarpley and
Dearn 1990). As a result, I chose to do a comparative study on the effects
of dispersants, fertilizers, and detergents. I tested Corexit 7664, 9550,
9527, and 9580, SLIK-A-WAY, Nokomis 3-F4, and Nutri-Bio 1000 with and
without crude oil fractions on the marine organism Tigriopus californicus.
I californicus, a harpacticoid copepod, in its natural environment of
high splash pools on rocky coasts must cope with the severe environmental
fluctuations in salinity, oxygen, temperature, availability of food,
population density, and buildup of toxins (Haderlie et al., 1978). 7.
californicus can also be easily maintained in laboratory conditions that
are almost identical to the original habitat, overcoming the problems of a
gap between the experimental and natural system (Foster, Tarrpley, and
Dern 1990). To devise a stable and easily replicable experimental system
for bioassay tests, I reviewed the studies of Kontogiannis and Barnett
(1973 and 1975) and Dorit (1977), and experimentally established
standards for container size, number of test animals, sex, type of medium
and light cycles. I also investigated questions raised about the differential
survival of male and female T. californicus with and without eggs when
exposed to a variety adverse conditions (Dorit 1977).1 evaluated the
effects of different crude oll fractions in 24hr light, 24 hr dark, and
reqular 12hr light and dark cycles, in tide pool and filtered water to
establish the best parameters to create repeatable and significant
