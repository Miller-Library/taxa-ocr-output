requiring organisms in the filtered water.
From his experiments, Dorit (1977) proposed that females with eggs
survive longer than females without eggs when exposed to crude ofl
fractions. I was unable to find evidence for this in repetitive experiments
using females with and without eggs (Fig. 3). In fact, males showed a
much greater sensitivity to crude oil fractions than females. Exposed to
I gram of crude, the female samples out lived the male samples by twice
the time (Fig 4). Likewise, the mineral oil in 24hr light tests (Fig 5)
showed that out of the organisms subjugated to higher temperatures and
oxygen deprivation, the two sets of females lived 4 days, twice as long as
the two sets of males. It was previously noted that in the juvenile stages,
female T. californicus had a better chance of survival than males (Vittor,
1971). This may be due to the fact that they are copulating with larger
males and thereby avoid being preyed upon by other T. californicus(Burton
1985). Yet, since adult males are the first to die when exposed to adverse
environmental conditions and since females can have 15 to 20 consecutive
broods after a single copulation (enough to last the rest of their 90 day
lifespan), rendering males relatively useless (Vittor, 1971), it is to the
population's advantage to have lesser numbers of males when under stress.
This would explain the sex ratios (1adult male:15 females) in the stressed
splash pools. It is also interesting to note that under the starving and
oxygen deprived conditions in figure 7 the male population crashed, but not
completely. Perhaps males are also more sensitive to changes if their
