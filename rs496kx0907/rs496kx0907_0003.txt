experimental conditions to properly test a variety of oil spill cleanup
techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Tigriopus californicus used in this study were collected from a high
splash pool west of Loeb lab at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
California. They were kept in a 100ml container filled with tide pool
water at 15° C with alternating 12hr light and dark cycles for at least a
week before being tested. To determine the best experimental density and
sex ratio, 5ml jars were placed within both the laboratory and field
populations overnight. Äfter removal, these samples were sexed and
counted under a dissecting microscope. Samples were also collected with
a sterile pipette from small (3Om1), naturally stressed pools (Vittor
1971) in the field. The T. californicus from the laboratory population were
tested in different container sizes, varying conditions of light, and tide
pool or filtered water. The only food avatlable was the unicellular algae
and bacteria contained in their water. They were placed in in Sml flat
bottomed jars to facilitate counting. The jar samples tested in 24hr
darkness were wrapped in tin foil and placed under soup bowis with
sufficient space for air circulation. They 24hr light samples were placed
under an incandescent light and were subject to slightly higher
temperatures. The final experimental samples used to analyze the cleanup
reagents and crude oil controls consisted of 3 adult females with eggs and
