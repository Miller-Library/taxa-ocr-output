Corexit 7664 (Figs. 8 &9): O.3ml Corexit 7664 by itself was mildly
toxic, killing all the samples within 12 days. When O.Sml crude oil was
added to 0.Jml Corexit 7664, the sample died overnight. Otherwise, O.3m1
Corexit 7664 prolonged the life of the 1g (0.1m1) crude samples from 5 to
15 days and the sample with a 3 gram tar ball from 7 to 11 days. The
sample with ig mineral oil and 0.Jml Corexit 7664 also died on the 15th
day.

9550 and 9527 (Fig. 10) proved to be much more detrimental to 7.
californicus. O.Iml of Corexit 9527 killed the sample within 15 minutes
and 0.00 Iml killed the sample in 4 days. 0.Iml of Corexit 9550 with or
without Ig crude killed the sample in 3 days. 0.1 ml of Corexit 9550
killed the samples within 15 minutes. 0.001 Corexit 9550 also killed the
samples within four days.
Corexit 9580 (Fig. 11): 1.24ml of the shoreline cleaner Corexit 9580
blocked the air/water interface and killed the sample in 2-3 days.
(Absolute mortality due to mineral oil blocking gas exchange occurs in
about 5 days). O.Iml of Corexit 9580 (not enough to block surface gas
exchange) and Ig crude killed the sample in 5 days (the same as ig crude
alone) and just O.Iml of Corexit 9580 killed the sample in 8 days.
SLIK-A-WAY & Nokomis (Figs. 12 & 13): O.ImI SLIK-A-WAY with or
without Ig crude killed the samples within 1Sminutes and 0.001m1
SLIK-A-WAY with or without ig crude killed the samples by the 2nd day.
