ABSTRACT:
In this experiment ! compared the toxicities of Exxon Corexit 7664
9550, 9527, and 9580, SLIK-A-WAY, Nokomis 3-F4, and Nutri-Bio 1000,
with and without 1 gram of crude oil, using the splash pool copepod
Tigriopus californicusas a test organism. Investigating T. californicusas
a test organism revealed that males are more sensitive than females to
change, that the organisms' survival is inversely proportional to the
amount of crude in their environment, and that they survive longer in
filtered water than in tide pool water when no outside air is available
These preliminary studies resulted in the final sample of 5 female 7.
californicus ( with eggs), in 3ml tide pool water, in a 12hr light/dark
cycle, at 15°C, with and without 1 gram crude oil to test the cleaning
reagents.
INTRODUCTION.
Since the Torrey Canyon and Santa Barbara spills in the 60's when
toxic dispersants were used to remove oil from the rocks and in the
process irreversably damaged the environment (Smith 1968), more
"environmentally safe“ cleaning reagents have been developed, but
evidently not perfected. Äfter the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, public
awareness about the tragic effects of oil in the environment and the
ineffectiveness, costliness, and destructiveness of clean-up procedures
