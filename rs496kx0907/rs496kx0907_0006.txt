The test Light, 0-24hrs (Fig. 1) describes the experimental controis
for 5 females (3 with eggs) in tide pool H20. The points where the
population increases are due to the appearance of juveniles. In the
laboratory condition of alternat ing12hr light and dark cycles the organism
survived over 30 days with a 608 reduction in its original population.
Exposed to 24hr light, the entire sample died in 7 days. Exposed to 24hr
darkness, the sample died in 30 days.
The Repetetive Crude Oil Fractions (Fig. 2) show that three
separate experiments under the same experimental condition respond in an
almost identical and repeatable manner. When exposed to 0.5q crude
sample T. californicus lived about 10 days as opposed to its 5 day suryival
when exposed to Ig crude. When exposed to a 0.Sml crude oil cover the
samples died in 4-5 days and died in 6-7 days when covered with the same
amount of mineral oil.
The Repetitive Female Crude (Fig. 3) shows that two sets of 5
females with no eggs in tide pool water, exposed to 1 gram of crude died
in 7 days. Two sets of 5 females (3 with eggs), exposed to the same
conditions died in 6 days. Two sets of 5 females (all with eggs) in the
same conditions died on the 6th and 7th day (although the early mortality
in one sample may be due to the fact that on the fifth day the oil had
broken loose and formed a cover over the surface). Overall, no difference
was seen between the organisms with or without eggs when tested with !
gram of crude oil.
