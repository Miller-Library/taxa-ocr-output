epinephrine, then stepping up concentrations, and then ending with another
wash at 0 mM epinephrine. The current and the command voltage were
measure on tape recorder (Tanberg Instrumentation Recorder, Series 115).
The information was then digitized.
Measurements in the Pleurobranchea pedal ganglion:
Before the experiment, a dose response calibration was done with
creatine sulfate serotonin. Concentrations of 10-8 to 10-3 serotonin were
tested. Between each serotonin concentration, the baseline was again
established by returning the electrode to a pool of without serotonin. The
difference was measured directly off of the oscilloscope screen. A suction
electrode was used to attach to a nerve bundle so that Grass SD9 Stimulator
could stimulate the whole cluster. A microelectrode was placed in one of the
ganglion's nerves to measure activity. The carbon-fiber microelectrode was
placed under a group of cells. The four track tape recorder was used to
record the responses of the current and command voltage for the carbon
fiber microelectrode and the membrane potential which were transferred to a
chart recorder for analysis (Gould Recorder 220). During the experiment the
table was tapped.
Testing NIE-115 neuroblastoma cells:
This experiment was done on a patch clamp set-up (List-Medical Patch
Clamp LM-EPC 7 amplifier and LIM-EpC 7 5/n 583644 headstage) and was
filtered at 3khz (Frequency Device, 902 LPF). A DAT tape recorder (Sony
High Density Linear A/D D/A tape recorder) was used to record the
amperometry data at +.6V. The same type of oscilloscope was used. A
gravity perfusion system was used to change concentrations. A calibration
