There are two troughs, the first smaller than the other. Figure 5B is graph of
computer subtraction the baseline from the after oxidation trace of three
different epinephrine concentration's voltammogram and shows these other
peaks very well.
To eliminate leak and capacitance currents a baseline was subtracted
from the voltammetric traces. Voltage and current were digitized (the
computer programs used were Clampex version 4.10 with Amp and Clampfit
Version 5.5 from Axon Instruments on an ZTS 386 computer with the A/D
input designed by Stuart Thompson) and the base OM epinephrine was
subtracted from the curve with the various epinephrine concentrations. This
was done by starting with the minimum point taking one whole cycle of the
curve to get the two traces in the same phase.
The level of the current corresponds almost directly to the
concentration. Figure 6 shows this with the current trace both before and
after a SmM increase in concentration. The epinephrine calibration was done
this way. The plot of concentration and current is Figure 7A. The plot of the
log of concentration and log of current is Figure 7B. The best fit linear fit for
this line (Cricket Graph 1.3) was y-5.43 + 0.86x which makes the power law
for this relationship y- 269153.47x0.86 (x-M, y-PA). Figure 7C is a plot of
log of concentration and log of current for serotonin. This line has a slope of
y=3.17 +0.14x (Cricket Graph 1.3). This was the best serotonin calibration
that was obtained. It was preformed before the Pleurobranchea experiment.
Figure 9A shows the cyclic voltammetry during the Pleurobranchea
experiment. This change occurred without stimulation. Figure 9B shows a
trace from the same experiment. The jump in amperometry corresponds to a
physical shock. The jump was 400 pA and decayed back down to the
baseline.
