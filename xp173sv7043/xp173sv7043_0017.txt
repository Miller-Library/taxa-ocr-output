Figure Legend:
Figure 1-The oxidation of the catecholamines occurs by this general
two electron process which is shown here with epinephrine.
Figure 2-The microelectrode is given a potential by the amplifier. At
an adequate potential, the fiber oxidizes the epinephrine in contact
with it. This results in two electrons being transferred to the carbon
filament which is detected by the amplifier and recorded as higher
current.

a microelectrode.
Figure 4-A picture from a carbon-fiber microelectrode of a display of
the voltage and current on the y axis and time on the x axis. The
voltage is a triangle wave which correspond to the potential of the
carbon-fiber. The current is the current flowing through the carbonÂ¬
fiber. The upper trace shows the background current. The lower
trace shows the current while oxidation is occurring.
Figure 5-A) An xy plot of voltage and current, voltammogram. The
inner trace is the background. The outer trace is in the presence of
25mM epinephrine. The additional current is from oxidation of
epinephrine. B) This is a voltamogram with the background
subtracted. There are three different concentrations here. The
electrode shows no change at O.0lmM epinephrine. O.ImM shows a
