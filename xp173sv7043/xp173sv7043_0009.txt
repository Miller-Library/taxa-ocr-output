Figure 9A does not give quantitative data, because a voltammetry
calibration was not done before the experiment. However it does raise and
answer some interesting questions. First it does not correspond to any of the
nerve stimulation that were given to the ganglion. It was a completely
spontaneous event, independent of activity in the one cell of the cluster whose
membrane potential is measured on the lower trace. However the current
trace is not ambiguous. It shows a dramatic increase in current and a very
definite peak at the raising positive voltage. No apparent harm was done to
the cells when shaken for the cell with the current clamped microelectrode
continued to spike normally. Figure 9B gives more quantitative data but has
more questions about it's validity. The signal was triggered by shaking the
table, but the signal is what was expected for release during amperometry.
Based on the calibration in Figure 7C 90 uM serotonin would give this
response.
The mouse neuroblastoma showed this same pattern, but in a more
controlled fashion. After the carbachol, which is not oxidizable, was added to
the NIE-115 cells the current rose dramatically from baseline by 1.6nA and
then slowly decayed as seen in Figure 10. When carbachol was added
without cells there was no change in the baseline. What is remarkable is the
slow time of the rise if what is measured is vesicle release. However, The
carbon-filament used was long and lay over a cluster of the cells. Therefore
the data represents the sum of the release from a number of cells which
would account the slow overall release. The calibrations were off and
epinephrine, not norepinephrine, was used, but the concentrations recorded
should correspond to norepinephrine levels between 1 and 100 UM.
