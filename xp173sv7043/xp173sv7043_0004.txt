Materials and Methods:
Electrode Fabrication:
The carbon-fiber electrodes were made by a standard method.
(Fishman, 1992). The carbon-fibers were spread onto a clean piece of paper.
Figure 3A is a picture of carbon-fibers. Smoother paper worked better. A
single fiber was separated with the finger tips. Multiple fibers were be fairly
easily visually distinguished from single ones. Two fibers together can be
separated by rolling at the tip or the middle. Fibers were selected that were
as long as or longer than the capillary tubes. A vacuum pump (Air Cadet,
Model No. 7530-40) was attached to a glass capillary tube (Work Precision
Instruments, Cat No TWISOF) and used to aspirate a single carbon filament
whose tip was overhanging the paper 2mm. The far end of the fiber was held
to prevent the whole fiber from being sucked in. Using the vacuum pressure,
the fiber was brought all the way through the capillary tube.
The capillary tube was then pulled in an electrode puller (David Kopf
Instrument Vertical Pipette Puller, Model 700C, modified by Professor
William Gilly) with heat set at 47. The carbon-fiber that separated the two
electrodes was cut and the electrodes were removed. The next step was to
dip the tips into epoxy (Epo-tek 301) for ten minutes while it filled the tip.
Four hours in the oven (NAPCO, Model 5830) at 65Â°C was adequate to dry
the epoxy, making a working electrode, Figure 3B. There was a differences
between different electrode pullers. The Narishiga PE-2 would not pull
electrodes that would fill with epoxy after pulling.
Electrodes were painted with silgard and then heated until dry. The
electrodes made this way worked normally and were made much more
quickly.
