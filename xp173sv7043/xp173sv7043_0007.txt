was done for epinephrine both at the beginning and the end of the
experiment. The effects of 1 mM carbachol alone were also tested. The
electrode was positioned with a very long carbon filament so the carbon
filament was resting on a group of NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells
which had been raised in culture (Mathes, 1992). The cells were kept normal
external saline (Mathes, 1992). Carbachol was then added.

Testing electrodes:
The behavior of typical carbon-filament microelectrode under cyclic
voltammetry is shown in Figure 4 if it is viewed with both current and
voltage on the Y axis and time on the Xaxis. The voltage trace is the triangle
wave. The current is the trace showing the curve. Each microelectrode will
show a different current trace, but the basic shape should be the same. It
should show extremes at both ends of the current trace. It should also show
another peak as the current increases past zero in the presence of an
oxidizable substance, as it does in the lower trace of Figure 4.
A working electrode in cyclic voltammetry should look like Figure 5A
if it is graphed xy with current the y axis and voltage the x axis, a
voltammogram. Each electrode again has a different basic shape. The bettei
the electrode and the slower the scan rate the thinner the leak and capacitance
is, which causes open middle to be reduced. A functional electrode also has
to show another peak when an oxidizable material is added that should be at
the positive side of the increasing voltage, the upper right of the curve. The
peak increases and moves to the right as the concentration increases. At high
concentrations, as the 25mM in Figure 5A, other differences can be seen.
