Introduction: Carbon-fiber microelectrodes are, and have been for years,
used in electrochemistry. The method has great potential for looking at
biological problems because it has fantastic speed, within milliseconds, and
sensitivity, detection down to 100 nM (Wightman, 1981). It has even be used
to measure single vesicle release (Chow et al., 1992 and Wightman, 1991).
The technique takes advantage of the fact that amine-comtaining
neurotransmitters are easily oxidizable. All catecholamines for instance,
oxidize in a two-electron process, shown for epinephrine in Figure 1.
Because the two released electrons are constant, they are, theoretically, a
measure of the amount of oxidation that has occured. The carbon-fiber
electrode takes advantage of this on a small scale and uses a 8 micron
diameter carbon-fiber. As shown in Figure 2, when the voltage potential of
the electrode, as locked in by a patch clamp amplifier, is above the oxidation
potential of the neurotransmitters, which is different for each substance, the
carbon filament oxidizes the neurotransmitter. The higher above this the
oxidation point the potential is set, the greater the rate of oxidation at the
electrode surface.
When a range of set voltages for the carbon-fiber is scanned, a leak and
capacitance base current causes a fluctuation of current, higher when it
increases and lower when it decreases. Above +1 V water is oxidized causing
a large peak. To determine the exact current for a disk shaped electrode
which is totally irreversible (assuming low concentration so that the oxidized
product diffuses away before being reduced) the equation for the current can
be solved to:
i= Covl2k
