The last step was to cut the carbon-filament very close to the end of
the glass of the capillary tube. A razor blade was used to cut the carbon
fiber. This was done immediately before experimental use.
Testing the microelectrodes:
The electrodes were tested in vitro. Baselines were tested in distilled
water with 150 mM NaCl. A ground, a bare silver/silver chloride wire, was
put into the solution. The electrode was connected to a headstage (Warner
Instrument Corporation, 5C-501) of patch clamp amplifier. The output
current was filtered (Frequency Device, 902) at 20 hz. The command voltage
was provided by Exact, model 119 Function Generator. Constant potentials
for amperometry were provided by a de current source. The current and
voltage were viewed on a Nicolet 3091 digital oscilloscope. Electrodes were
simply put into the pools with varying known concentrations of
neurotransmitter for testing. To prevent premature oxidation, the solid
compounds were stored in a freezer in a light opaque container. When the
epinephrine and serotonin solutions were measured out, they were added to
150 mM NaCl solution that had been bubbled for 1 minute with 99.999% N.
(Liquid Carbonic) and sealed with Parafilm. As soon as the compound was
added it was again bubbled with N2 and sealed. For a portable N2 source,
balloons were filled with N2 and fitting with a rubber tubing adaptor and a
needle.
Epinephrine dose response calibration:
The electrodes was positioned in the bath and solutions were changed
by using the profusion device. The carbon filament was kept at +.5V and
tested at a range of concentrations. The order was: baseline with O mM
