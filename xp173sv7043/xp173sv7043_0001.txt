Abstract: Carbon-fiber microelectrodes were used to electrochemically
measure concentrations of oxidizable neurotransmitters, serotonin,
epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The electrodes consisted of a carbon
filament surrounded by a glass capillary tube. The carbon filament was
connected to a patch clamp amplifier to set the filament at a certain voltage
and to measure current flow, which increased during oxidation. This was
done both with a triangle wave, cyclic voltammetry, and a set potential of +5
Calibration curves were done with known
and .6V, amperometry.
concentrations of both epinephrine and serotonin in vitro. In vivo recording
were performed in Pleurobranchea pedal ganglion and NIE-115
Neuroblastoma cells. Epinephrine behavior was close to theory with a one to
one relation between increase in I and [Epil, but the response to 5-HT was
not as strong. The electrodes measured 90 uM (400 pA by amperometry
release of serotonin from the Pleurobranchea pedal ganglion. Readings were
also taken from NIE-115 cells which showed 1 to 100 uM (1.6nA)
norepinephrine release after stimulation with carbachol, a non-oxidizable
analog of acetylcholine.
