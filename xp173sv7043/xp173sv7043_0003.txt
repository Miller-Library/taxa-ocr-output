v1/2 is the scan rate and because i = C dv/dt for any capacitor, like this
electrode, the higher the scan rate the higher the background current from
capacitance. Co is the concentration of oxidized substances. K is a factor
that takes into account a number of different factors, such as the geometry of
the carbon-fiber surface and the nature of the oxidation reaction occurring.
The relation to current and concentration in this equation is direct for any
given voltage (Bard and Faulkner, 1980, 222). When the carbon-fiber is set
at a certain potential, the situation is similar to when one particular voltage of
the whole range scanned in cyclic voltammetry is examined. Concentration is
important because the only way new oxidizable molecules get to the carbon-
fiber surface is by diffusion which is driven by the concentration.
Not all catecholamines are the same, and serotonin presents a special
difficulty because its oxidized form creates a film over the electrode which
reduces the electrodes sensitivity (Wightman, 1988). It can be reduced by
scanning at very high scan rates (200V/s) which unfortunately also involves a
lot of background current, making it difficult not to saturate the patch clamp
amplifier.
The next part of this study was to use the microelectrodes to measure
neurotransmitter release in biological systems. Two systems were chosen.
First, The pedal ganglion of the Pleurobranchea is believed to secrete
serotonin (Rhanor Gillette, personal communication) which is supported by
the production of serotonin by the pedal and abdominal ganglia (Wilbur,
1985), and the NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells, which contain
norepinephrine (Herken, 1982).
