Acknowledgements: I am going to make this section all together too long
because I will attempt the impossible and thank all those who deserve it. I
will undoubtedly forget some of those who need it (like Mom who is always
forgotten at times like this) I apologize profusely, the mistake was not because
I have forgotten your contribution but is entirely the fault of my sleep debt.
First for the scientific thanks, both Rhanor Gillette, Rob Swezey, and
Harvey Fishman gave me scientific aid when I requested it. In fact, Harvey
Fishman saved my life and gave me the key that allowed me to get it
working. I would like to thank them all for helping a lil' undergrad as he
floundered his way through his project. I would also like to thank Gilly for
the stream of equipment he lent me (even after I started breaking his stuff)
The first person who needs to be thank is Stuart, who if he had any
sense, would have kick me out of his lab the first time I walked in the door or
at least when I screwed up with the electrode puller after he spent 15 minutes
telling me not to screw up. Thanks for giving me a change to screw up again
(and again, and again....). Stuart was also "totally key" in getting both the
technical and theoretical aspects of this project working. Sorry I didnâ€™t listen
and follow more than I did.
Sam Wang needs to be thanked not only for scientific help, but more
importantly for trying to give me an education in bad music and helping me
keep my sanity. I also would like to thank you for not just doing this project
yourself (although you would certainly have done a better job). I pray that
you'Il find your blonde (my addition) tortured artist very soon.
Iwould also like to thank Chris for getting me to experience first hand
how gross coffee really is and showing me the terrors of married life and
those totally killer NIE-115 cells.
