Now for the random thanks. My housemates and lab partners need to
be thanked to putting up with my insanity-"overwork leads to all forms of
5
s. 1 d like to thank Coke giving me the calories and caffeine to
metal disorder:
survive this quarter. I'd like to thank my body for putting up with all the
terrible things l've been feeding it. Most important lâ€™d like to thank 107.1
rocks and 94.5 who I listed to almost continually (except 5 hours for sleeping
some Garth Brooks, Right Said Fred, and a little Debbie Gibson). To them I
owe for holding what little sanity I have left together. I shall miss 107.1 more
than anything else about Monterey.
My final thanks is to my father. All those nights of reading me to sleep
from Crucible: The Story of Chemistry had some effect after all. Thanks for
making me what little of a scientist I am.
