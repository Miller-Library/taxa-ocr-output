Discussion:
The major finding of this study is that electrochemical detection of the
catecholamine neurotransmitters serotonin, in Pleurobranchea pedal ganglion,
and norepinephrine, in NIE-115 neuroblastoma cells, is possible.
The first lessons is that there are four basic types of electrodes.
Diagrams of the first two types are in Figure 8. Electrodes of the first type
were broken. The current saturated in the direction of the voltage, positive
for positive voltages and negative for negative voltages, except around zero
where they changed. The second group (8B) were electrodes that had no
carbon-filament exposed. They showed a flat trace until the oscilloscope gain
was increased to the maximum and then showed a parallelogram trace with a
negative current. The third group showed normal voltammograms, but
showed no response to epinephrine. The fourth group were functional
electrodes which showed normal voltammograms and showed an increase of
current with epinephrine. Occasionally the functional electrodes would show
a trace like the third trace on Figure 8. This was simply a problem of the
gain being too high (.5pA/mV instead of .IpAlmV) for that particulai
electrode. Higher gains often gave even more problems because of
mismatched impedance between the electrode and the headstage.
The calibration for epinephrine is very promising. Figure 7B has a
slope near 1,.86. This is close to theory. Even so I would advocate a dose
response calibration before and after each experiment to see any deviations
from normal because each electrode is different and use changes its response.
As the electrodes are used they get dirty (Fishman, 1992) which reduces their
sensitivity. The response of a dirty electrode would be less current change for
a given concentration change which is what was observed.
