potentials. The conventional pathway-action potential, calcium influx, and
then secretion—is bypassed. This shows that the calcium influx may be
sufficient to get norepinephrine release.
The concentration of transmitters released in these systems has not
been measured before. Both concentrations are in uM range and localized in
a very small area. This is a very powerful signal even taking into account the
artificial nature of the stimulus. Wightman reported total concentration of
catecholamine release from bovine chromaffin cells of 10 uM (1991).
Serotonin receptors have very high affinities, upper nM concentrations, for
serotonin (Wang and Peroutka, 1988). This means that there would be a huge
detection of these signals. Again I must state that these concentrations are
high, but the exact level I am unsure of, because the calibration for the two
experiments were poor.
I would like to stress that these results are largely suggestive. They
raise some interesting questions about the biological systems which were
observed. However, they were done in this study to examine the behavior of
the carbon-fiber microelectrodes in biological systems. In this respect, they
were complete successes. The phenomena exhibited, whatever their cause,
were very much what was expected for both voltammetry and more
important amperometry in two different systems.
There several areas yet to be explored. Reliable dose-response
calibrations is needed before anything else. The technique of cutting the
carbon-fiber very close to the glass or polishing the surface also needs to be
improved to improve detection. Now that this procedure is working, the
options are almost endless.
