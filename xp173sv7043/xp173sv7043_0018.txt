very distinct peak. ImM has a very large response. In fact, the
current has saturated the amplifier so the top of the peak is
flattened.

concentration.
Figure 7-A) A graph of the amperometric current vs. concentration of
epinephrine. B) A graph of the log the concentration and log of the
current for epinephrine with the baseline subtracted. It has a slope
of .86. C) This is a graph of the concentration and log of the change
in current for serotonin. It has a slope of .14.
Figure 8—A) is the xy plot of voltage and current for a broken
electrode. The current saturates the amplifier for almost the entire
trace. B) An xy plot for an electrode with the carbon-fiber missing or
covered. The current is very small and negative, and the curve it
makes is a very angular shape. C) A normal electrode at too high
gain. When the gain is reduced the trace looks like Figure 6A.
Figure 9—Electrochemical measurement of serotonin in pedal
ganglion of Pleurobrachea A) The trace is the current with cyclic
voltammetry. The first half shows the baseline current flow. Then, a
change occurs and the current increases and changes its shape. Next,
the gain of the amplifier was turned down to prevent saturation.
After the change, an additional peak can be seen that corresponds to
oxidation at the carbon filament. B) The increase in amperometic
