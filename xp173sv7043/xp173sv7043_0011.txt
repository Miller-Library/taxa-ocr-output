Figure 7C is more troubling. The response to serotonin is much worse
than expected. The slope is a seventh of the theoretical value. It has been
stated that after being oxidized serotonin forms a film over the carbon-fiber
(Wightman, 1988). Again this dirtying of the carbon-filament surface results
in the slope of the log graph less than one. The value, .14, indicates a very
dirty electrode. This loss of sensitivity with corresponds with experience
with serotonin during other attempted calibrations. For example, an electrode
started with strong response of 900 pA from 10-3M, and yet when the
calibration was finished, the electrode showed no change at 10-2M.
It is difficult to know exactly what compound's oxidation is being
recorded using this technique. But I feel secure in the correct identification of
the compounds in these experiments. In the Pleurobranchea experiment, the
first trace is serotonin. It is released without any outside disturbance of the
cell, and it is a single clean peak in the oxidation which suggest that only one
oxidizable species is involved. The amperometric measurement is more
difficult to identify as secreted serotonin. Although is seems very unlikely, it
could be simply the result of cells being lysed and spilling their oxidizable
contents onto the electrode. However, the cyclic voltammetric measurements
clearly show that the cells are able to release serotonin. If the electrode really
had broken into a cell, the oxidation would occur more rapidly, and the decay
should have been slower if it was trapped in the cell's contents.
Norepinephrine occurs in NIE-115 cells ten times as much as the
other catecholamines found, dopamine and serotonin. Therefore it seems
likely that it is the major component of the release.
The release that is linked to carbachol is without action potentials, so
this release occured without spikes. Carbachol is detected by the muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors which in this preparations does not cause action
