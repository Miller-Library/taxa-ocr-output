current corresponds to a mechanical stimulation. The voltage of the
electrode was +.6V.
Figure 10â€”Two digitized scans overlaid. The lower is the baseline
current done with the electrode in the bath resting on the NIE-115
neuroblastoma cells with a holding voltage of +.6V. The second,
higher, is current after carbachol was added.
