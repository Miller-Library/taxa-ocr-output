increases from .006 at 40 my to .027 at 100 my, whereas K.,
remains relatively constant (Fig. 4). In wild-type channels, K.,
decreases slightly from .00023 at 60 my to .00018 at 100 my, and
Ky increases from .021 to .029 over the same range(Fig. 5).
Discussion
It is clear from the results of this study that a histidine at
position 351 is necessary and sufficient to confer pH sensitivity to
toxin block in SgkviA channels. This is likely due to the fact that at
low pH histidine is a positively charged residue, whereas glycine is
always neutral. However, it is also possible that steric differences
between histidine and glycine could account for the differences in
pH-sensitivity.
Results obtained in this study also seem to indicate that
tityustoxin blocks SgkviA channels by a mechanism similar to that
shown by other scorpion toxins, at least in the H351G mutant.
Changes in Kp, Kan, and Kay values are consistent with those found
using charybdotoxin. Goldstein and Miller graphed the Ky values of
charybdotoxin binding to Shaker channels by use of the same log
scale that was used in this paper (Goldstein and Miller, 1993). In
their data the K, increases by about a factor of .063-.079/my
