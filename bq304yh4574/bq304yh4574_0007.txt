less was blocked at pH 6 (fig. 2 D). Similar resusits were obtained
in one other experiment.
Voltage Dependence of Toxin Binding
The Kp of toxin binding was calculated at each voltage using the
equation:
Ko - ioxinl Toxin/(contro + toxin)
Where lg represents the current when no toxin is present after a
500 ms pulse and lgn represents the current in the presence of toxin
after a 500ms pulse. The K, of toxin binding increases as voltage
increases, as is shown in fig. 3. The increase in K, is similar in both
the wild type and H351G channels.
Change in Ke and Ke rates
The time constant (t) of current increase in the presence of toxin
was measured by fitting a single exponential to the curve. Using the
1= 1/(Kltoxin) + Kor)
equations,
and Ko- KoKon
it is possible to solve for Kgg and Kan. It was not possible to fit an
exponential to current traces from voltage steps below 40 my for
the H351G. Using wild-type channels, exponentials could not be
fitted to voltage steps below 60 mv. In H3516 channels, K...
