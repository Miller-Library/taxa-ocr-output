Fig. 1- Upper trace is Kt current before tityustoxin aplication.
Lower trace is Kâ€œ current in the presence of tityustoxin. The
current in toxin reaches a maximum much more slowly. A single
exponential was fitted to this slow rise between the arrows. 10
nm P15A tityustoxin was used.
Fig. 2- (A) H351G at pH 8.2. The top trace is the control current, the
bottom trace is the current in the presence of tityustoxin. (B)
H3516 at pH 6. The amount of current blocked by tityustoxin is
similar to (A). (C) Wild type channels at pH 8. In the presence of
toxin, current reduction is similar to H351G channels. (D) Wild type
at pH 6. Almost no current is blocked by tityustoxin. In all cases
50 nM tityustoxin was used. The H351G traces are from a 500 ms
voltage step to +40 mv. The wild type traces are from a 500 ms
step to +30 mv.
Fig. 3- Wild-type Ky values are the average of three experiments.
H351G Kp values are the average of 5 experiments. Kp's are graphed
as the log of the ratio of the K, at each voltage divided by the K, at
0 mv. The Kp of toxin binding increases with voltage in both wild
type and H351G channels.
Fig. 4- Average of five Ka, and Kgy rates of tityustoxin acting on
H3516 channels. Ka and Kgy are graphed as the log of the ratio of
Kopof at each voltage divided by Kepr at 40 mv.
Fig. 5- Average of two Ka and Kgn rates of tityustoxin acting on
wild-type channels. Ko and Kgr are graphed as the log of the ratio
of Konof at each voltage divided by Kpof at 60 mv.
