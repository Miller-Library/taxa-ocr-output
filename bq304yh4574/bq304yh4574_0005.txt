loxin was diluted in the same solution used in the bath to a
concentration of 100, 50, or 10 nM. Solution changes were made by
injecting 1.5-2 ml of the new solution into the bath while a vacuum
removed the previous solution. Complete solution change could be
done in under a minute, and leak generally improved during this
period.
Currents were recorded during 50 and 500 ms pulses to -40,-20.
0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 my in toxin free-solution. The toxin
solution was then washed in, and currents were again recorded for
the same duration and voltages.
Time constants were obtained by fitting a single exponential to
the slow rise of current traces in toxin. The exponential was fit
from the time at which the control current reached a maximum to
the time at which the current in toxin reached a maximum (Fig. 1).
This was done to avoid problems caused by rapid activation of the
unblocked current.
