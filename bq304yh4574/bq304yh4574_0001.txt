Abstract
Tityustoxin block of wild-type and mutant SgkV1A channels from
Loligo opalesceus neurons was studied in Xenopus oocytes using the
two electrode voltage clamp method. The mutant channel was
created by replacing a histidine residue at position 351 on the outer
vestibule with a glycine. Wild-type channels show greatly reduced
sensitivity to tityustoxin block at pH 6. The glycine mutant's
sensitivity to tityustoxin was not pH-dependent. Block of both the
wild type and mutant channels proved to be voltage dependent. Kp
values ranged from 14 nm at 0 my to 70 nm at 100 my for both
channels. K rates of H351 channels were not effected by voltage,
whereas Ka rates of wild-type channels decreased slightly with
voltage. Kg rates increased as voltage increased in both types of
channels. Results suggests that a charged residue on the toxin
enters the channel pore when tityustoxin blocks these channels,
making the toxin sensitive to the membrane voltage.
