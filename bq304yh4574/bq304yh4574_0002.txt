Introduction
Tityustoxin is a small peptide of 30 amino acids found in
scorpion venom and has been shown to be a potent K“ channel blocker
(Werkman et al. 1993). Though much is known about other scorpion
toxins, both functionally and structurally, tityustoxin is relatively
new and unstudied. Understanding tityustoxin better can help in
underständing the structure of the channels they bind to.
Scorpion toxins have become important tools in understanding ion
channels because they provide a rough map of the channel. Scorpion
toxins can bind to channels at 8 or more positions. By knowing
exactly which toxin residues bind to which channel residues, and
what the structure of the simple toxin peptide is, a general map of a
channel can be made. Fixing 8 or more residues in space sets
dimensional limits on proposed structures of the channel.
A great deal of work on understanding the structure and blocking
mechanism of charybdotoxin, another scorpion toxin closely related
to tityustoxin, has already been done. The accepted mechanism for
charybdotoxin block is that the peptide binds to the outer vestibule
of the channel and a lysine at position 27 enters the pore, thus
