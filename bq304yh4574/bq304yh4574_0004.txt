changes over the biological pH range. DEPC treatments were used to
chemically alter the histidine residue, but did not conclusively show
that histidine is responsible for pH sensitivity to tityustoxin. This
paper will show more convincingly that this is in fact true by using
a mutant channel in which this histidine is replaced by a glycine.
Materials and Methods
SgkviA channels containing a G87R mutation where expressed in
Xenopus oocytes by cRNA injection as previously described by
Rosenthal and Bezanilla(1997). After 2-3 days currents between 5¬
30 uA could be recorded from wild type channels. Currents from
H351G mutants were a little smaller. Currents were recorded by the
two electrode whole cell voltage clamp method using p/4 leak
subtraction. Only oocytes that had a small leak (under -0.2 uA at -
60 mv holding potential) and stable K“ currents of at least 4-5 uA
were used.
Electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl, and the external bath
solution was either ND-96: 96 mM Nacl, 2 mM KCI, 1 mM MgCl,, 1.8
mM Cacl,, and 5 mM Hepes or a solution containing 90mM Nacl, 10
mM KCI, 2 mM Cacl,, 5 mM MgCl,, 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.15. For the
pH-dependence experiments, solutions of 85 mM Nacl, 10 mM KCl, 2
