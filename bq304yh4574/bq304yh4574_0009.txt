compared to .072/my for tityustoxin acting on SgkvlA channels.
However, Goldstein and Miller only showed data from -20 to 20 my.
it is not known how the Kp of charybdotoxin changes above 20 mv.
Goldstein and Miller also showed that Kg of charybdotoxin increases
with voltage by about a factor of .079/my, while Kay remains
constant. This is similar to the results found in this study with the
H351G mutant. The apparent decrease in Ka, in the wild-type
channels is likely due to the small sample size of wild-type
experiments; this anomalous result merits further investigation.
The similarity between results presented in this paper and those
found for charybdotoxin suggest that tityustoxin is binding to
SgkviA channels by the same mechanism by which Charybdotoxin
binds to Shaker channels. In this model, the peptide binds to the
outer vestibule with lysine-27 entering the pore, inhibiting ion flow.
At more positive membrane voltages, the voltage drop across the
membrane and Kt ions trying to exit the channel force the toxin
peptide off the channel. This increases the Kp and Ky values at that
voltage.
