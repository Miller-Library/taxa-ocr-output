SqkviA Channels
SqkviA is a K“ channels cloned from a CDNA library prepared
from the stellate ganglia of Loligo opalescens (Rosenthal et al.
1996). It was previously shown that this channel shares many
homologous regions with Shaker B channels including the outer pore
region. A point mutation was made to the channel at position 351 by
replacing a histidine with a glycine. This position is homologous to
position 425 in ShakerB, a proposed binding site for charbdotoxin
(Goldstein and Miller, 1992). In all experiments both the wild-type
and H351G channels were used.
pH-dependence of block by tityustoxin
pH-dependence of toxin block was shown by comparing Kt current
before and after application of 50 nM tityustoxin at pH 8.2 and pH 6.
The effects of toxin on H351G channels showed no detectable pH¬
dependence. At pH 8.2, 51.4% of the current was blocked. Similarly,
at pH 6, 57% of the current was blocked. (see figure 2 A,B) However,
the wild-type channels did display pH-dependent block by toxin. 57%
of the current was blocked at pH 8.2(fig. 2 C), whereas only .05% or
