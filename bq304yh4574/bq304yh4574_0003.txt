blocking ion flow (Mackinnon and Miller, 1988). It is plausible that
tityustoxin blocks by the same mechanism due to similarities in the
peptide structure. However, there are structural differences in the
proposed binding regions of these two toxins which could lead to
different blocking mechanisms. The primary purpose of this paper is
to determine whether tityustoxin blocks by the same mechanism as
other scorpion toxins or if some other mechanisms needs to be
invoked.
A secondary goal is to show that a histidine at position 351 of
SgkviA channels is necessary for the pH dependence of tityustoxin
block of these channels. It has previously been shown that changing
the homologous site in Shaker channels (position 425) from wild
type phenylalanine to histidine causes the channel to become pH
sensitive to charybdotoxin binding. Changing pH from 7-5.5 causes
the channel to become 200 fold less sensitive to charybdotoxin
(Perez-Cornejo et. al, 1998) It has also been shown by previous
spring students, Sky Pittston (1996) and Uma Sanghvi (1997), that
tityustoxin block of the wild type SgkviA channels in squid neurons
is pH dependent. It was hypothesized that a histidine at position
351 is responsible for this pH dependence because its charge
