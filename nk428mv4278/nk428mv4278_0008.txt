The rate of tetrazolium reduction due to G-6-P
dehydrogenase remains constant in all stages studied.
This implies that there is a continuing synthesis of this
enzyme during oogenesis. If therewere no synthesis, the
concentration of enzyme would be diluted with yoke and
cytoplasm during the growth process. Thus the rates
from a decreasing concentration system corrected for
optical pathllength would decrease. Conversely, constant
readings imply that there would have to be increasingly
more enzyme present to prevent dilution and result in
the production of an equal amount of color per unit volumn.
The data for succinic dehydrogenase is not as obvious.
When the standard deviations are carefully considered
it is seen that the 70 and 110 micron stages are very
similar, and that the upper limits of the 9Ou stage could
correspond to the lower limits of the other two stages.
It is therefore possible to state with some reservation
that the succinic rate remains almost constant during
the period of development studied. By the same argument
used for G-6-P dehydrogenase, the results imply that
succinic dehydrogenase, and therefore mitochondria, are
also being produced at a steady rate during development
from 70 to 110 microns in diameter.
Summary:
1. A simple new microphotometric method was developed
for studying the rate of tetrazolium reduction in single
oocytes.
