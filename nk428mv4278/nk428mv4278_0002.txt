Introduction:
Although much is known about RNA activity in
developing oocytes, (2,3,4) little is known about the
activity of enzymes. In most organisms the oocytes are
embedded in tissue and cannot be obtained free from
contaminating cells. One of the advantages of marine
annelids is that oocytes from most stages of development
can be found free in the coelom. Nevertheless it is
difficult to obtain enough oocytes of the immature
stages for standard enzymatic determinations. In order
to overcome this problem, a simple photoelectric system
was developed to measure the rate of reduction of
tetrazolium salts resulting from enzyme activity in
single oocytes of Cirriformia spirabrancha. The results
indicate that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and
succinic dehydrogenase are both being synthesized at
a steady rate during oogenesis.
Instrumentation:
A block diagram of the microphotometer used is
shown in figure 1. The basic unit was a trinocular Nikon
microscope, Model STR, and an American Optical spot lamp
with voltage selector, Model 350. A Sola constant voltage
transformer, Cat. 30807, was used to reduce electrical
noise. Light passed through a Klett +66 filter with a
transmission band from 640 to 700 mu. A pinhole diaphragm
