Beer's Law prompted consideration of the optical
path length of the absorbing medium. The optical path
length in this case is the oocyte diameter while the
absorbing medium is the formazan impregnated cytoplasm.
Although it is questionable whether the oocyte test
situation is a pure application of Beer's Law, the rates
and their standard deviations have also been computed
with this correction factor considered, and the results
of this appear in the "corrected rates" columns of
Tables 1 and 2.
Taking standard deviations into account the data
shows that the activity of G-6-P dehydrogenase remains
constant throughout the period of development studied.
Succinic dehydrogenase apparently follows the same
pattern, although the results are a little less conclusive.
Discussion:
Tetrazolium Methods:
Tetrazolium salts are excellent dyes for histochemical
studies of enzyme activity. Methods have even been
developed to extract the tetrazolium from incubated
tissues in order to determine spectrophotometrically
enzyme activity. (5) Thus it is evident that tetrazolium
reduction can be used for enzyme rate studies in oocytes
provided substrate, temperature, and pH all remain
constant.
Scattering Effect:
Since the amount of scattering due to oocyte
