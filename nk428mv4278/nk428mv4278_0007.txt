cytoplasm changes little if at all during a 15 minute
run, any change in readings is primarily the result
of absorbtion by the blue formazan. A minor scattering
effect may be caused by the deposition of the formazan,
but this is likely to be consistent. Thus the relative
relationships in the results would still hold. Visual
observations indicated that scattering by the cells was
not very extensive.
Linearity of the Rate Curve:
Although the slope was determined for each trial,
this slope generally had to be extrapolated from the
section of tracing from 4 to 12 minutes. Within this
time period the tracing was straight, ignoring minor
noise, approximately 70% of the time. At the beginning
of each run when the trinocular was opened, the recorder
needle would move to its highest value. The slope from
this point would decrease rapidly for about two minutes
and then remain constant in the interval from 4 to 12
minutes. After this the line would begin to level off,
indicating reduced rate. This may result from deposition
of formazan around the sites of enzyme activity. It is
possible that the initial steep drop could be an equilibration
effect or actually the best measurement of enzyme rate.
Since this high rate was not consistently present, and
when present had a variable slope, the slope lines were all
extrapolated from the 4 to 12 minute segment, and therefore
still hold their relative relationship.
