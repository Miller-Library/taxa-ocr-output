2. When corrections were made for the different
optical path lengths of these eggs, the results showed
that the tetrazolium reduction by the activity of
G-6-P dehydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase were
very nearly constant in all stages. Constant enzyme
activity in different stages of development implies
constant synthesis of G-6-P dehydrogenase and succinic
dehydrogenase over the course of oogenesis.
3. Future application of this method may be very
helpful in studying enzyme activity under a variety
of conditions, especially for material not available
in large amounts.
