yielding little color even after 40 minutes of incubation.
Larger 80u oocytes present in the same dish under the
same conditions showed very obvious color production.
High G-6-P dehydrogenase activity was observed in both
large and small eggs, with intense color production
clearly visible in the first 20 minutes.
Quantitative Observations:
Three sets of control recordings were made. An open
field, a sample of incubation solution alone, and eggs
incubated in sea water, all showed consistent behavior
with no voltage change. This indicated that any drop
in recorded voltage during the test runs would be due
only to color production in the egg.
Ten runs were made for each size egg for each enzyme.
Figure 2 shows a typical recorder tracing picturing the
voltage drop resulting from the enzymatic activity. These
records were analysed by two different methods to determine
the rate of reduction of the tetrazolium salts. In the
first method the rate in microvolts per minute was
measured from the voltage drop during the interval
between five and ten minutes. In the second the rate
was determined from the line which best approximated
the slope of the tracing, generally straightest in the
interval from 4 to 12 minutes. The averages and standard
deviations were determined for the ten runs, and the
results are listed in the uncorrected rates columns of
Tables 1 and 2.
