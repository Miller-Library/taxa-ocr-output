which reduced the field to 40 u at 400X was placed
over the filter. Incubation chamber slides filled
with several eggs could then be placed on the
microscope stage and positioned so that the center
of the egg completely covered the field.
The light sensing device, an Internation Rectifier
silicon photovoltaic cell, SiM, was attached to one
end of a stiff rubber tube with inner diameter of 1.0
inches. The end of this tube with the photocell attached
was fitted to a light tight metal box. The tube and
box were then affixed over the trinocular attachment.
The output of the photocell was amplified and recorded
by a Sargent Recorder, Model SRL.
With the trinocular prism closed the output voltage
was zero. With the prism open open field readings were
in the range of 1.7 millivolts + 0.2 mv. depending on
the room lighting. Measurements were made with red
light since the color produced by the formazan product
of the tetrazolium dye is blue. The combination of
red light and silicon cell was ideal since the maximum
spectral responce of the photocell was between 600
and 900 mu.
