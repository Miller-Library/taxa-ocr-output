three developmental stages used were 70, 90, and 110
microns, the last of which represents maturity.
Incubation Proceedure:
Freshly collected oocytes were placed in a depression
slide and quick frozen on dry ice in a solution of sea
water containing 5-7% PVP. The eggs were thawed after
five minutes, and samples of 10 to 20 eggs were placed
in a chamber whose walls were made from 2 coverslips
sealed with vaseline. This chamber had a depth of greater
dimensions than the largest diameter egg used. To these
chambers were added two drops of either G-6-P dehydrogenase
or succinic dehydrogenase incubation solutions prepared
according to Barka and Anderson.(1) The Sargent recordings
were started at the exact time the incubation solutions
were added. Eggs and solution were mixed, covered, then
sealed with vaseline. The chamber was placed on the
microscope, an egg chosen, focussed, and centered over
the diaphragm, and last,the trinocular was opened. The
time interval between addition of solution and the
opening of the trinocular averaged 2.0 minutes. Photocell
outputwas recorded until the total elapsed time was
15.0 minutes. All runs were made at 24.0 + 0.5Â°0.
Results:
Qualitative Observations:
Qualitative observations of dye formation showed
that in the smallest oocytes, 50u, succinic dehydrogenase
activity only reduced a small amount of tetrazolim,
