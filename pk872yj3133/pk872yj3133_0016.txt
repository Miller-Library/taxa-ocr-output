Head Structures of Pherusa
Summary
Pherusa papillata is a sand-dweller inhabiting a U-shaped burrow. It
is a surface deposit feeder ingesting inorganic and detrital matter. Sand
particles are picked up and sorted by two highly mobile palps. Muscular
lips shovel in the particles brought to it by the palps.
The highly modified anterior setae of the first three setigerous segments
create a protective cage within which, when open, the retractile head lies.
The setae form a grid, du- to a mesh created by the specific arrangement of
the setae, which is effective in keeping sand particles from entering the
enclosed cavity. The grid adjusts to different sand sizes, preventing sand
from entering and disruption of the strong ciliary currents of the head which
are important for feeding and respiration. When the head is retracted the
setae close tightly acting as an operculum and protecting the anterior end.
