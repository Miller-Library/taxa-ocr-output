Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
The head lacks setae and papillae. Located on a dorsal, semicircular
ridge are sight, blunt-pointed branchiae (Fig.21). They are ciliated, creating
a current that moves anteriorly, away from the head. When extended, they show
no motile of contractile abilities. On a worm 5.2 cm long they are 0.45 cm in
length and 0.04 cm in diameter.
The palps, whitish in color, have a ventral groove with a lobed margin;
in the groove a ciliary current accompanied by a film of mucus moves toward
the head. Dorsally each palp bears another ciliated tract, in a slight
depression whose current moves away from the head. The palps are highly
mobile and are able to contract and extend considerably. They move about on
the surface of the substratum, picking up sand and loose detrital material in
the ventral groove and transporting it towards the mouth. Some particles are
dropped along the way; the lips bordering the ventral groove can flex out-
ward (Fig.22) allowing the particles to drop. The rest of the particles are
carried further and are dropped at the base of the palps, forming a "sand-pile'
(Fig.23) on either side of the mouth. There is no connecting groove between
the palps and lips.
Dorsal to the palps is a small triangular lobe bearing four cresent-
shaped eyespots.
There are three lips; two large, protruding median lips and a puckered
ventral lip. They are a light orange-pink color. A small membrane connects
the lips to the outer branchiae. The lips exhibit muscular movements (Fig.24).
The median lips move outward and upward as the ventral'lip moves downward and
outward. Then the median lips move back, as does the ventral lip. This is
accompanied by downward peristaltic movements along the base of the lip,
reminiscent of swallowing.
