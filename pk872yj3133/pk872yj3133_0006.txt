Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
In a neurosetal bundle there are four hooked bristles arranged in a vertical
line which project out perpendicular to the body wall (Fig:17). They are all
of different lengths, the longest being the most dorsal, the sizes progressively
decreasing ventrally, and the shortest being the most ventral. The lengths
range 1.4-.8mm for a 5.2 cm worm. They are shorter and thicker (0.48 mm)
than the notopodial setae. Both types of striations are present, but the
transverse intervals decrease distally (Fig.18). The setal tips are not flexible
possibly related to the fact that transverse wedges interrupting long striations
are absent. Internally the bases are again spirally arranged (Fig.17). The
farther up the spiral, the shorter and more ventrally located the seta is
externally. Small straight setae are present at the bases of the neurosetae.
Schlieper (1927) mentions their possible role as remnant aciculae. The
neurosetae can retract, rotate, and move back and forth. They are less responsive
to disturbences than the notosetae.
In the first 10-12 setigerous segments, both sets of setae are directed
forward (Fig.19). Thereafter the setae begin to point posteriorly. The
notosetal fans are oriented vertically in the same anterior segments and then
become oriented horizontally (Fig.20).
Head Structures
The prostomial and peristomial structures have fused together without
a boundary to form the head. Spies (1975), for Flabellidermata commensalis,
makes the distinction that the prostomium bears the eyes, dorsal lip, the
nuchal organs (a sensory structure), and palps, while the peristomium bears the
median and ventral lips, the nepridiopore and branchiae. Hartman (1969) makes
no distinction.
