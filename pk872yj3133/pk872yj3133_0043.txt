Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
Pherusa papillata
The range the palps extend to is shown. The
Fig. 36 :
arrows indicate the mobility of the palps while the
dashed line indicates the area foraged the most
frequently by the palps.
Lateral view of the head and of the range of

the palps. In cl-aring an area of detritus and
small sand grains, the palps create a slight
depression around the head. A small ridge of
large sand grains forms immediately next to the
head, having been rejected by the sorting mechanism
of the palps.
The direction in which the head points changes

frequently. The arrows indicate the direction of
the setae after the head has rotated. Head rotation
reaches a point, marked by the dashed line, that
it does not go beyond, indicating some type of
restriction placed on the head by the position
of the worm's body in the sand. Reaching this
point the head reverses. Note that a back and forth
rotation is occuring, not a continous movement in
one direction and then back again.
