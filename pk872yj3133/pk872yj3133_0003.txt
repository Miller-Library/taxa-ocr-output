Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
I.K. Be
Gross External Morpholog
The body of Pherusa papillata is cylindrical and tapers posteriorly (Fig.1).
Dimensions of all specimens are given in Table 1. The average length was 4.5 cm.,
average diameter .25 cm., and the average number of segments was 71. There was
not a strong correlation between size and number of segments. The body surface
is soft and papillated, with a light distribution of small sand grains embedded
in the body wall at the bases of papillae. The sand grains are most densely
distributed at the dorsal surface of the head region, where the papillae are
largest and most concentrated, but even here the embedded sand does not form
a definite crust. Papillae are absent in the segment boundaries, making ex¬
ternal segmentation fairly clear.
The body is olive green in color with the exception of the first three or
four setigerous segments which instead are orange in color and lighter ventrally
than dorsally. The main body color blends with the color of the sand, offering
some possible camouflage value.
In cross section the worm is eliptical with the dorsal surface rounded and
the ventral side slightly flattened (Fig. 9). Occasionally the anterior third
of the body exhibits bulges, and a dark green or a whitish color can be seen
through the body wall. Spies (1971) mentions that green ovaries and white
testes are present in mature individuals. A pulsating vessel can be seen
through the dorsal body wall, sending green-pigmented blood anteriorly. The
setae of the first setigerous segment are greatly elongated and directed for¬
ward, forming the cephalic cage characteristic of the Flabelligeridae. The rest
of the segments have shorter simple straight notosetae (Fig.2) and simple hooked
