Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
I.K. Berzins
Introduction
Species of the family Flabelligeridae, a group of sedentary marine
polychaetes, show some unique specializations at the anterior end. The head
and its appendages are fully retractile, and when extended are still encased
in a large "cephalic cage" of anteriorly directed setae. Day (1967) and
Hartman (1969) offer general accounts of the family. Two large German monographs.
Gunther (1912) on Flabelligera diplochaitus and Schlieper (1927) on Pherusa
(Stylaroides) plumosus, provide good anatomical and morphological accounts of
the species concerned, but do not contain many details on behavior and function.
Spies (1971 ยง 1975) begins to account for a variety of functions associated
with feeding, respiration, excretion and sensory perception in the worm
Flabelliderma commensalis and mentions several other species of flabelligerids
for comparison, but presents primarily further morphological information. A
functional understanding of the complex anterior end of flabelligerids is still
far from complete.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional morphology
of the head structures of a flabelligerid, Pherusa papillata (Johnson,1901),
and to investigate some aspects of the relationships between these head
structures and the life habits of the worm. The species is well known to
systematists (e.g. Hartman, 1969), but little is known in detail of its structure
and behavior.
