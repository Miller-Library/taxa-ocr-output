In addition to burrowing and crawling motions, the animals can swim, with
an upward spiraling motion.
An interesting response occured when worms, exposed on the surface and for
some reason not burrowing, contacted a Diopatra tube. A worm contacting the
tube immediately begin to burrow next to it or to wrap itself around the base
of the tube. In the natural habitat from which Pherusa was collected, Diopatra
ornata builds vertical tubes which project deep into the sediment. This
stabilizes the bottom substrate, and may create a preferable environment for
sand dwellers such as Pherusa papillata, which feed on the surface and do not
have strongly consolidated tubes. It would seem advantageous for Pherusa to
be able to dectect the presence of Diopatra tubes, and to burrow near them.
