Body Position
In laboratory situations the worms formed U-shaped burrows with the head
and tail at the surface (Fig.39). The body is greatly elongated compared to
its length when out of the sand. The worm, while rotating its exposed anterior
portion, appears to be twisting the body; it apparently does this only so far
in each direction for there is not a complete rotation of the head at the
surface.
At the posterior end,assmall mound ofldefected sand e√∂f thessame size

which lacks detritus and small sand grains. The burrow is not strongly
consolidated, though a small amount of mucus is produced by the worm which may
line the tube to provide some support, When removing worms from sand, no
strongly formed tube was found and the animal was not surrounded by a thick
mucus coat.
Within the tube, the worm moves its tail up to the surface and retracts
it. The anterior end occasionally withdraws into the sand, the particles of
sand collapsing the opening of the burrow. In laboratory burrows where portion
of the body was visible, pressed against the side of a glass bowl, the worm
moved within the burrow by slight peristaltic and sinusoidal waves, with
some twisting.
A more complete picture of movement in the burrow was not obtained but
in worms fully exposed at the surface of the sand locomotory movements were
observed. Peristaltic waves and lateral undulatory waves moved anteriorly;
at the same time neurosetal hooks were projected outwards with the hooked tips
pointing downward and posteriorly, acting as anchor points for the passing
waves. The head was usually retracted and the cephalic cage closed but
occasionally both were extended. The setae of the first chaetiger were not
