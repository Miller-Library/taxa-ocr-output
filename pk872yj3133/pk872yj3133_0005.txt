Noto- and Neuropodial Setae
Each setigerous segment (excluding the first three chaetigers) has two
bundles of straight, fine, simple setae dorsally and two bundle of shorter,
thicker, simple,hooked setae ventrally(Fig.9). Parapodia are poorly developed,
and are present only as slight bumps. The notosetae in each parapodium numbered
5-9, the specific count being constant on individual worms. On a worm 5.2 cm.
long they averaged 1.7 mm. in length with shafts about .19 mm. in diameter.
They are a light yellow color and are marked with longitudinal and transverse
striations, the transverse intervals increasing in length distally (Fig.10).
Near the attached end the transverse striations form thin, fine lines (Fig.11)
as described by Schlieper (1927) but at the tips they become wedged shaped (Fig.12)
as Gunther (1912) describes them. The tips of the setae are very thin and
flexible, suggesting the wedge shaped transverse marks represent interruptions
of the longitudinal (themselves internal fibrils?) increasing setal flexibility.
Externally the setae are arranged in an open fan pattern (Fig.13), each seta
projecting out from an individual opening. The fan arrangement results from the
internal spiral positioning of the attached setal bases (Fig.14). The spiral
is not a symetrical arc but is rather elongated in one direction (Fig.13, the
solid line). Regularly interspersed between the bases of the notosetae are
fine straight setae, with faint transverse striations.They have hooked roots,
as compared to the straight roots of the longer notosetae, and do not project
beyond the body wall. The notosetae are non-retractable and move back and forth
as a result of body motion (Fig.15). The notosetae may play some type of
sensory role, for when lightly touched, the segments bearing the disturbed setae
contract (Fig.16). The two nipple-like papillae close to the setal bases, if
they are neural structures, may also be involved.
