Head Structures of Pherusa papillata

When portions of the dorsal surfaces of several of the anterior segments
are exposed, notopodial setae of the second and third chaetigers are spread
open keeping the area free of sand (Fig.35). This area has the large club¬
shaped papillae in high concentrations.
When the setal cage is expanded and the head extended, the palps extend
along the substratum under and well beyond the edges of the cage (Fig.27).
Though the palps can move in many directions and their range is large, they do
most of their foraging in a limited area (Fig.36, shown by the dashed line).
A lateral view (Fig.37) shows that a slight depression is created around the
worm where the palps have foraged. This is cleared of detritus and small sand
particles. A small ridge forms around the head (Fig.37) built up by larger
particles which were brought in by the palps but have been rejected. Worms
were frequently observed to retract their heads, close up their anterior setae
and use these anterior setae to sweep the immediate area. This removed the
built-up ridge and may have uncovered some buried detritus and sand suitable
for ingestion. Watching one worm for a period of four hours, this sweeping
motion occured at intervals averaging 13 minutes. Also, while sweeping, the
worm often shifted the direction of its head (Fig.38) enabling the palps to clear
the feeding radius for a full 360°. The worm never fully rotated; reaching
a certain point in rotation, the worm reversed and turned in the other direction,
A restriction is placed on the rotation of the head by the position taken by
the remainder of the body.
Frequent contact between sand and setae fof the cephalic cage inhibits the
settlement of organisms on the setae; vorticellid ciliated protozoans were found
growingeon the setae only within the cavity, on the medial surface of the setae,
