ingestion of surface particles, therefore any ingested particles would have
to be from the natural sands. The bowl was not covered. The fecal pile that
formed contained few natural sand grains, only detrital material with minute
sand grains. The worm spent part of the time with its head at the surface
and part of the time submerged. It was considered possible that the palps
could be extended even with the worm submerged. The setae forming the cephalic
cage do close when the anterior end withdraws into the sand, but once below
the surface the setae may open and clear an area to allow the branchiae, the
major respiratory organs (Spies, 1971), to extend. To account for the detrital
matter found in the feces, the worm may have used its secondary feeding
mechanism (page 9) in the sand and at the surface. While at the surface, the
palps did not pick up the larger crushed beads, but they were waved about in
the water as though to catch detritus particles in suspension.
Additional Observations
The following observations of behavior and responses to stimuli are
fragmentary but provide some interesting leads for future work.
The worm is extremely sensitive to light. A bright light concentrated on
the head resulted in withdrawl below the sand. A light shined on the underside
of a petri dish containing a worm, caused the worm to turn over with its
dorsal side down. Changing the position of the light source, so that it shone
from above, caused the worm to flip back.
When placed on sands of different size-grades, the worm burrowed sooner
and faster in the larger particle sizes. However, with coarse sand the "scoop
intervals (the intervals between sweeping motions of the head and setae, page 12)
were much shorter, a matter of seconds as compared to minutes for the smaller gizes.
