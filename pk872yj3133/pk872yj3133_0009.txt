Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
The Cephalic Cage
When extended, the head is surrounded by the elongate setae of the first
three setigerous segments, notably those of the first (Figs.4,25). Setigers 1-3
show a progressive increase in size, and their setae undergo considerable wo
modification. On each side of each somite the dorsal and ventral setal bundles
are drawn closer together. The neurosetae are straight, like the notosetae,
and all setae bear longitudinal and transverse striations. Both noto- and
neuropodial setae increase in number and length progressively as one moves an
anteriorily. The longest setae from the first segment of a worm 5.2 cm long
were 0.76 cm. The fourth setigerous segment had four hooked neurosetae and
five straight notosetae. The second and third segments bore six straight
setae in each setal bundle, and the first setigerous segment had ten straight
notosetae per bundle and seven straight neurosetae. The notosetae here are
up to .029 cm in diameter but the neurosetae still remain larger. The notosetae
of the second and third segments are slightly longer than the neurosetae but in
the first segment the situation is reversed.
The setae of chaetiger one show a precise arrangement. The shortest and
finest setae are located laterally; setae become progressively longer as one
moves dorsally and ventrally creating a cage-like structur√© (Fig.25826). The
dorsal most and ventral most setae begin to shorten but only slightly. The
tips of the setae are very fine and flexible. The dorsal setal tips curve
downward and the ventral setae curve inward. As a result, the characteristic
cephalic cage is formed by the first segmental setae. It is semicircular in
a cross-sectional view and is open ventrally (Fig.27). When expanded, the
setae create an encaged cavity in which the extended head apparatus lies.
The branchiae do not extend beyond the tips of the setae, they lie totally
