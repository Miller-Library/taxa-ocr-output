Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
I.K. Berzins
Materials and Methods
The study was done at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in
Pacific Grove, California during April and May, 1976. Specimens were collected
subtidally roughly 1,500 ft. to the east of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, at an
average depth of 30 ft. The worms were found in the loose, small-grained sands
associated with well developed (high vs. low density) Diopatra ornata communities
which were located at the outer edges of kelp (Macrocystis) beds. The worms
were collected by hand, with a dredge and by taking shovelfuls of sand, which
were transported to the laboratory in plastic bags.
A binocular dissecting microscope and a hand lens were used to observe
live specimens. Carmine red and graphite particles were used to indicate ciliary
currents. For anatomical study, worms were relaxed in equal parts of seawater
and of a MgCl, solution isotonic with sea water. Some specimens were fixed in
Bouin's' solution prior to dissection. Fine anatomical details were observed
under a compound microscope.
The majority of living worms were kept in the laboratory in uncovered
plastic pans filled to a depth of 4-5" with sand taken from the collecting
areas, and provided with running sea water at a temperature of about.1200.
Several worms were kept in seperate glass bowls. Altogether 32 worms were
collected.
