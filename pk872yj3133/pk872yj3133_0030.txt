Pherusa papillata
Tables 3 & 4 :
Sand sizes were obtained by using six
Tyler-Standard screens of mesh sizes 2.362.
1.397, .991, .495, .246 and .125 mm.
Krranged in this order on a Cenco-Meinzer
Sieve Shaker, sands were sorted and were grouped
into catagories by what had accumulated between
screens. One liter of dried sand from the
collecting areas was used.
Examination of the gut contents of two
worms from the field were compared with
mall samples of sands from the collecting
areas to determine further selectivity.
