Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
A worm in a natural position in the sand is able to protrude the lips into
the pile of material deposited by the palps, shoveling and scooping it into the
mouth. To check if the worms were actually ingesting the sand, the contents
of worms freshly collected from the field and of worms that had been kept
for several days in the laboratory were made. The guts were always filled with
sand. The average dimensions of the sand ingested were 0.24 x 0.18 mm, with
an occasional large particle (1 mm). Comparing the sizes and types of sands
available in the field to what is in the gut, it is apparent that a selection
process is occuring, with the palps and perhaps the lips providing the sorting
mechanism (Tables 3-4). Fecal matter consisted of sand, detritus, and sometimes
setae. It was occasionally expelled as pellets enclosed in a very delicate
mucus membrane, but usually it was loose.
The forward current created by the branchiae removes water from the region
ventral to the head. Replacing this a flow of water passes from dorsal to
ventral between the branchiae (Fig.21); suspended detritus is thus brought in.
Some of it is carried out again by a strong current created by the ciliary fringe
of a small red-colored ridge on the ventral side of the head posterior to the
branchiae. Some of the suspended detritus brought in is carried by a small
ciliary path starting between the bases of the two palps and leading into
the mouth. This may be a secondary feeding mechaniwm. A few of the worms eg
collected had palps of different sizes, one being shorter than the other. In
the laboratory, one worm place in a dilute solution of MgCl automized both
palps. Regeneration to a functional condition occured within three weeks.I
Loss and regeneration of one or both apparently occurs in nature. Animals le
lacking palps can ingest sand with the lips but they may also rely on this
secondary feeding mechanism.
