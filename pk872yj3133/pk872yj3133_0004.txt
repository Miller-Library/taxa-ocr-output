Head Structures of Pherusa papillata
neurosetae (Fig.3). The head (Fig.4), formed by the fusion of the prostomium
and peristomium, bears eight green branchiae, two fleshy palps, eyespots and
three large protruding lips. It is retractable and can withdraw deeply into
anterior body somites. When everted the head is surrounded and enclosed by the
long setae of the first setigerous segment. Posteriorly, at the tip of the tail,
is a dorsally positioned anal opening. More detailed considerations of partic¬
ular structural elements on body regions appear below.
Papillae
The papillae covering the body vary in size, density, shape and distribu¬
tion (Table 2, Figs. 5-8). Dorsal papillae are larger than those in correspond-
ing on the ventral side, and all the papillae decrease in size posteriorly.
Anteriorly, the papillae are oriented forward, posteriorly they point back. The
number of papillae per unit area at a given level on the body is greater ventrally
than dorsally and the density of papillae also increases posteriorly in the
tapered portion of the body. Wart-like papillae cover most of the body, while
the elongate and nipple-like papillae are located primarily in close proximity
to one another at the bases of setae. Especially prominent are the two
nipple-like papillae at the base of each sheaf of notosetae (Fig.7). The first
three setigerous segments have especially long, club-shaped papillae in high
densities. Spies (1971) mentions the presence of possible nerve fibers in the
club-shaped papillae and notopodial papillae in Flabellidermata commensalis.
The papillae may be serving as sensory structures, but their specific functions
were not obvious in the present study.
