DISCUSSION
At least two factors appear to affect movement of
Lottia: position relative to sea water level and the
intensity of wave force.
My observations show that
Lottia prefer to move when they are .8m to 1.Om above
tidal level. The lack of activity at levels higher
than 1.bm above sea water level maybe due to the need
for Lottia to be in a water splash zone while moving
(Abbott, 1956). If they aren't, then movement is
minimal to avoid desiccation. In contrast at levels
of .5m above SWL and below where wave activity is the
greatest individuals showed significantly less move¬
ment.
Also on days where the wave force was highest
individuals had a large decrease in total movement.
Therefore animals appear to be adjusting their behaivor
in response to the wave force environment.
A difference in tenacity was observed between
moving and stationary individuals with moving indi-
viduals adhering less well.
However, even the low
tenacity exhibited by Lottia when crawling far exceeded
the forces generated by waves during my observations.
This is not surprising when one considers such
factors as fatigue which could reduce tenacity, and
increased suseptibility to dislodgement due to terri¬
torial interactions and periodic awkward positioning on
substrate formations.
