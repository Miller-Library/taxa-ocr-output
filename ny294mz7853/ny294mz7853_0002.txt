INTRODUCTION
Lottia gigantea inhabits rocks exposed to surf in
the intertidal zone (0.0 to 1.5m above MLLW) (Hewatt,
1937).
These animals characteristically move during high
tide and are stationary at low tide. (Hewatt, 1937.
Abbott 1956, Stimson 1976). However, the organisms are
subjected to maximal hydrodynamic forces at high tide
therefore, in this respect high tide is not an optimal
time for crawling. I wanted to examine whether these
hydrodynamic forces were great enough, relative to
Lottia's ability to adhere to the rock, to cause the
animals to restrict their crawling behavior.
