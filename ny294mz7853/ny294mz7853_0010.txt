SUMMARY
Crawling behavior in Lottia gigantea is affected
by position relative to sea water level. Greatest
movement occurs while limpets are .8m to 1 m above
tidal level. Animals .4 m above MLLW and lower
(where greatest wave activity is occurring) and
levels greater than 1.5 m above MLLW (areas of
possible desiccation stress) showed limited move-
ment.
Increased wave force inhibits total movement of
Lottia during high tide.
Significant differences exist between the tenaÂ¬
cities while clamped down and crawling.
4.
A safety factor of 9.0 was determined by comparing
the minimal force of crawling vs maximal observed
forces.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I would like to thank DA. Mark Denny, Tom Hahn and
Mark Shibata for their assistance during the quarter.
Especially Dr. Denny whose influence I found conducive
for good learning.
