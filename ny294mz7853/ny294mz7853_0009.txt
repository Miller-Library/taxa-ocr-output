It would be interesting to examine crawling again
comparing tenacity before and after high tide to see if
any reduction in adhesion occurred due to fatique.
Other future studies would be to epoxy plates across
their shells thereby increasing drag or using videotape
from a position horizontal to the Lottia and examine
behavior during wave action.
