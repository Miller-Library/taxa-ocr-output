The average tenacity for stationary Lottia was
1.38 x 10Â° N/m2 (Sp+ 2.4 x 104N/m2) while moving indi-
viduals tenacity averaged 3.9 x 10' N/m2 (SD 7.5 x 10
N/m"). Observed wave forces were compared to limpet
tenacities. The minimum observed crawling adhesion
2.82 x 10' N/me was used in the comparison.
The
maximum calculated hydrodynamic force is

with Cpmax and Crax set at the maximum lift and drag
coefficients determined in flow tank (Fig. 3). max is
the largest calculated field measurement. The safety
factor is 9.0.
