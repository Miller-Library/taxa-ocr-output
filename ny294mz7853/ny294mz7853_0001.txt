ABSTRAC
The crawling behavior of Lottia gigantea was
studied. Animals moved most when.8m to lm above tidal
level with a decline in movement observed by limpets at
levels below .4m SWL. Animals moved less when the
wave-induced velocities were higher. Animals adhered
less well while crawling, but even then could resist
forces nine times those exerted by the observed waves.
