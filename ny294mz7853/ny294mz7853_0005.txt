ing spring scale was then attached to the clip and the
limpet was pulled from the rock at a 45° angle to the
substratum. This angle was chosen because it approxi¬
mates the direction of the vector sum of the forces of
lift and drag felt by a limpet in moving water.
Tenacities were measured for twenty Lottia.
Before testing, ten were hand touched on the apex until
they were firmly clamped down. The other ten were
pulled while crawling.
IV Determinations of Lift and Drag Coefficients
Coefficients of lift (Cp) and drag (Cp) were de¬
termined in a flow tank similar to that described by
Vogel (1981). Lift and drag forces were measured for
three different Lottia shells using lift and drag
transducers. Flow speeds varied from 0.0 to 3.58 m/s
recorded values of lift, drag, and water velocity were
used to calculate C, and Cp.

Where Fy and Fp are the actual forces measured at
velocity u, S, is area projected laterally of the
shell, Sp is the basal area of the shell, and p is the
density of seawater.
