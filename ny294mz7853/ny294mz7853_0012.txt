FIGURES LEGEND
Figure 1: Distance moved per 1/2 hours as a function
of position relative to SWL.
Figure 2:
Velocity vs Distance moved per day,
Increased velocity (proportional to force)
results in lower total distance moved.
Figure 3:
Maximum lift and drag coefficients of three
lottia shells (apex orientated at 90Â° to
flow) with velocity ranging from 0.0 to 3.5
m/s.
