Observation of Crawling Behavior:
This study was conducted in the intertidal zone of
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. The
study area was established on a vertical rock face
which extends twenty-meters from the shoreline in a
northwesternly direction. Two separate square grids
(3/4m by 3/4m) each composed of sixteen points, twen¬
ty-five om apart were painted onto the vertical surface
of rock using fluorescent paint. This rock is inhabi-
ted by numerous Lottia gigantea ranging in size from
3.5 cm to 7.0 cm. A wave height scale of six incre¬
ments, 50 cm apart was labeled in the area between the
sites. The lowest mark was 1.0 meter above MLLW.
Due to the exposed nature of the sites, observa¬
tions of limpet movement were conducted from the shore
with the assistance of a telescope (25x). Field re¬
cordings were made on five days (May 6, 7, 11, 16 and
17). Sixteen Lottia (eight in each site) were labeled
by painting flourescent numbers on their shells. A dot
was painted over each animal's apex so recordings would
be from a uniform location.
The distance individuals moved was determined by
periodically recording the position of each individual
