RESULTS
In figure 1 movement in a 1/2 hour period is
compared to an individuals height above tidal level.
Lottia are most active when .8m to 1.0m above tidal
level. At the higher and lower elevation (relative to
tidal level) activity declined. The decrease in move¬
ment at the highest levels can be explained by the
organisms being outside the splash zone thus avoiding
desiccation. Limpet movement in dry regions increases
the likelihood of body fluid loss, hence possible
desiccation. In the lower regions wave interaction
appears to have significantly decreased movement.
Using hy as an indicator of average wave height
an average water velocity at the site was calculated
for each day. The square of the velocity is propor¬
tional to the force exerted on the experimental.
Lottia.

Figure 2 compares u to total distance moved for
all individuals for each day of observation. There is
a significant negative correlation (b = -6.3, N - 5, r'
- .97). Lottia moved less at higher water velocities,
presumably because of the hydrodynamic force exerted on
it.
