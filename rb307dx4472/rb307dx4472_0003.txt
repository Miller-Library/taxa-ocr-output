Menge (1972, 1974) studying Leptasterias in the Puget
Sound region has found that they eat most in late summer and
least in the winter. This might be due to winter storms as
well as immobilization of the females due to brooding. Lep
tasterias also respond to light, feeding more at night.
He has also analysed their diets, including prey eaten
and calories of prey consumed. He states that prey is
chosen selectively and varies with their habitat. The food
eaten by Leptasterias around the Monterey Bay area was not studied,
so their regular diet was not necessarily used for the following
experiments. In fact the prey items were rather randomly
chosen for their abundance and ease of attainment. Since the
object of the experiments was only to try to find the criteria
for different foods being selected any combination of foods that
would be eaten was fine, as long as there were sessile and moÂ¬
bile foods and there was a definite preference for certain foods.
The lack of knowledge of their regular prey proved no problem
The question that originally sparked enthusiasm for a
detailed look at foraging patterns and prey selection in
Leptasterias was that of why a starfish, an animal with
limited perceptual abilities, would often pass over numerous
prey items while foraging when it seemingly had no assurance
that
it would find something better with further wandering. Is it
possible that starfish are able to optimize prey selection?
Does their behavior suggest that they can recognize different
environments and prey densities and forage accordingly? If
they can forage in a selective and optimal manner, what are
the components of this behavior - learning, instinct or a
combination of factors?
