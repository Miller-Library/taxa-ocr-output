ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank my advisor, Chuck Baxter, for
his constant assistance, without which I would have been
stumped many times. And also for his enlightening bits of
information that often opened up new doors in how to approach
and understand a problem or result. Those I have worked near,
exchanged ideas with and received help from in the lab also
have my warmest thanks.
