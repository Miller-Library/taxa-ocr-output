ABSTRACT
Prey selection and foraging patterns are two very im¬
portant behaviors for Leptasterias hexactis. In order to try
to understand these behaviors more fully studies would have to
be done in the lab where Leptasterias could be closely mon¬
itored and their environment manipulated. This should be done
in the most natural circumstances and with the least amount
of disturbance to the asteroids to preserve their usual patterns,
Clay plates with different prey items to select from and
different distributions of prey were suspended in a 80 1 tank.
The plates were large enough, it was hoped, to represent an
area of rock that would normally be occupied by the Leptasterias.
The starfish were never handled but could be observed while
foraging and selecting prey. A flat sea table was also used
and again the animals were observed but not disturbed.
Data obtained from these and smaller finger bowl exper¬
iments has revealed something about the frequency of eating,
movement associated with the density of food in the environ¬
ment, and that Leptasterias might possibly recognize different
prey densities and choose prey accordingly. It is strongly
suspected that prey selection has a component of learning
involved in the behavior. The Leptasterias also seem to op¬
timize food choices. Comparisons of calories per individual
prey per hour to consume show that the prey with the highest
caloric yield are chosen. This is dependant however on
the environment, what prey are present and the relative sizes
and densities of the prey.
