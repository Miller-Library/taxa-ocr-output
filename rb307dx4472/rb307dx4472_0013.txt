but takes a long time to catch or eat the calories per hour to
consume the prey may make it not worth catching. C. pelta is very
high on the scale caloricly but it has an effective escape
response from starfish that makes it hard to catch if not
trapped, which is virtually impossible on the flat vertical clay
plates used in the experiment. So C. pelta were never seen eaten.
L. planaxis although not as high in calories as limpets are
easy to catch if they are in the search range of the asteroid
and not too hard to consume so they seem to be preferred after
the more catchable limpets.
Many starfish will subsist on B. glandula as a food source
if it is abundant and there is a lack of more preferred prey that
is easy to catch. The B. glandula won't escape and the starfish
can stay and eat its fill.
T. funebralis not only has a low caloric value but also
has an effective escape response. They were never seen eaten
in the sea table or on the plates by Leptasterias. The Pisaster
did eat T, funebralis in the sea table when B. glandula was
predominant, but the Pisasters move faster than Leptasterias
and also can handle larger prey items, making T. funebralis
a more caloricly feasible food.
