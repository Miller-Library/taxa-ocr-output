Fig. 1 & 2) Number of prey remaining in food bowls over a
12 day period. The foods preferred will be consumed the
fastest. So order of preference is limpets, L. planaxis,
T. funebralis and M. californianus. Two seperate experiments
were run.
Fig. 3) The first block shows the number of each prey item
that was maintained on the plates. The second block shows
the number eaten out of all the prey items that were ever on
the plate. The replaced prey as well as the original are
included.
L - limpets (C. digitalis, C. scabra, C. paradigitalis)
PL - Littorina planaxis
B - Balanus glandula
M - Mytilus californianus
T - Tegula funebralis
Fig. 4) Shows what food is eaten and how often by the
starfish on the plates. Number of meals, total calories for
all meals and calories per day are shown for each starfish.
B - Balanus glandula
D - C. digitalis
PD - C. paradigitalis
S - C. scabra
M - Mytilus californianus
PL - L. planaxis
Fig. 5) See fig. 4 for key. Shows what food was eaten and
how often by the starfish in the feeding bowls. Number of
meals, total calories for all meals and calories per day are
shown for each starfish.
Fig. 6) Bars represent the largest percentage of time, out
of the complete time the experiment was run, that the starfish
remained in one area. Data was from the sea table experiments,
one with abundant limpets and the other with B. glandula.
P - Pisaster ochraceus
L - Leptasterias hexactis
