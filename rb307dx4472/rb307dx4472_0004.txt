METHODS
The determination of what Leptasterias chooses to eat,
when to eat and where to eat required a number of different
experiments. Five different experimental procedures are
described below. They were used to answer specific questions
as well as yielding data that was eventually combined to show
differences in patterns due to different environments.
1. Six small finger bowls, each 10 cm in diameter, were
filled with between 15 and 25 potential prey items and one
Leptasterias. The prey items included L. planaxis, C.
digitalis, C. scabra, T. funebralis and M. californianus.
The bowls were kept in running sea water and checked once
a day. Any empty shell was noted for that day and re¬
moved. This set up was used to test food preferences.
As the animals slowly ate their favorite foods, they were
left with less and less desirable prey to chose from.
The order, in which they ate the foods, should serve as
an indicator of the preference for that food. Since all
food was in such a small space, it was assumed to be
equally detectable and thus food choices were by preference
rather than chance.
One small bowl, with four Leptasterias in it, was filled
only with M. californianus. The question addressed by this
experiment was to see if providing Leptasterias with only
one food source for a certain period would make them
ingestively conditioned to the M. californianus and come
to prefer it over other food. After conditioning the
animals for 19 days, they were transfered to four seperate
bowis each containing M. californianus, L. planaxis and
C. digitalis. All bowls had running sea water and were
checked daily.
Three Leptasterias were released into a 801 tank (1m X 2.2m
X .4m). Water was constantly running except at a low tide
once a day from approximately 8 AM to noon. The lighting
was constant and the temperature, taken at intervals over
two weeks, was constant at 15'C f .25°. These Leptasterias
served as a set of "hungry" starfish and were used as
