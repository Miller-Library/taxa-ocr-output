presented in figure 3. Below is a description of the distri¬
bution of the prey, pertinent facts about the size of the prey
and the size of the plates with the number of star'on each.
Plate 1- Abundant B. glandula and large M. californianus.
This food is easy to capture but takes a long time for
handling and eating. In fact the M. californianus proved
to be too large (over 3cm) for the Leptasterias to
handle efficiently. Two Leptasterias were on the plate
which measured 30cm X 90cm. This plate was meant to
represent an abundance of sessile organisms in patches.
2- Again abundant B. glandula and large M. californianus.
Plate
Only one Leptasterias was on this plate which measured
30cm X 60cm. This plate was meant to represent an abun¬
dance of sessile organisms well dispersed.
3- One small patch of B. glandula and small M. califor
Plate
nianus. This plate was meant to be sparsely populated.
Two Leptasterias were on this 30cm X 90cm plate.
4- One small patch of B. glandula and small M. cal¬
Plate
ifornianus. Two Leptasterias were on this 30cm X 90cm
plate also. This plate was suppose to be abundant rela¬
tive to plate 3.
Plate 5- Small to medium M. californianus (small less than 1 cm,
medium 1 to 2cm)oon this plate. It measured 30cm X 180cm
and contained two Leptasterias and two Pisaster. The
plate was meant to represent very abundant conditions.
The Leptasterias used were collected from two places,
Yankee point and Pescadero point. The sizes ranged from three
centimeters to seven centimeters with the average at 4.8 centi¬
meters. The Pisasters used came from many different areas
around Hopkins Marine Station. They ranged in size from four
to seven centimeters with an average of 5.3 centimeters.
