Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
Abstract
Pagurus samuelis is found consistently higher than Pagurus granosimanus in the
rocky intertidal of China Point in Monterey Bay . The adequacy and availibility of Tegula
shells to P. samuelis and P. granosimanus was studied to investigate the possibility of
competition for shells as a mechanism of maintaining tidal height segregation. The
investigation was done in three portions: a mark and release study of live snails to
directly find the rate of supply of new shells, creating a shell adequacy index using crab
weight and shell diameter, and a comparison of the shell adequacy of P. samuelis and P.
granosimanus where they co-occur and occur separately. Although the mark and release
study yeilded no mortality after six weeks, data from the shell adequacy index suggests
that large P. samuelis and P. granosimanus are not shell limited. The interspecifc
competition for shells was not significantly different from intraspecific competition,
and therefore does not play a major role in maintaining tidal segregation.
