Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
The introduction of new shells to the hermit crab population is very
slow and could not be measured in six weeks. Wilber and Herrnkind (1984)
marked and released snails in the salt marshes of Florida and found the rate of
new snail shells into the hermit crab population, but the mortality rate of the
T. funebralis is too low to measure directly in six weeks. Further study with a
larger number of tagged snails and a longer time period are needed to
determine the actual rate of introduction of new shells.
The shell distributions of the protected and semi-protected areas
suggested that larger hermit crabs are shell limited because hermit crab shell
distributions were skewed to larger shells than Tegula spp. distributions (Fig.
5-6), but the shell adequacy ratio versus shell diameter plot (Fig. 11) indicates
that the crabs needing smaller shells are more shell stressed than crabs
needing larger shells. Bertnessâ€™s (1981b) studies indicated that larger crabs
are more successful in fights for shells than smaller crabs, so the presence of
small crabs in the 15-20 mm shells in this study are indicative of an abundance
of large shells. If there were a shortage of large shells, the smaller crabs
would have been evicted by larger crabs.
The distribution of Tegula spp. seems to contradict the findings of the
shell adequacy vs. shell diameter plot, but the number of hermit crabs and
Tegula spp. collected differ by one order magnitude, so even a very slow
mortality rate of the Tegula spp. could keep the P. samuelis and P.
granosimanus well supplied with shells.
Another possible explanation for the discrepancy is that predators may
prefer certain sizes of Tegula spp. skewing the availability of one size over the
others. Fawcett(1984) noted that the Pisaster giganteus preferentially eats
larger snails. The crab, Cancer is known to break off pieces of shell in
