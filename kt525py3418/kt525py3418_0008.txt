Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
preying on shelled animals, and this type of predation if selective would
reduce the relative availability of a shell size class.
Interspecific competition
Comparisons of mean shell adequacy ratios of P. samuelis and P.
granosimanus in areas of overlap and non-overlap indicate that the strength
of interspecies competition for shells is not significantly different from the
strength of intraspecies competition for shells (Fig. 12-13). If interspecific
competition were a major factor of segregation of P. samuelis and P.
granosimanus, the shell adequacy ratios in areas where the two species coÂ¬
occur would be lower than shell adequacy ratios in areas where the two occur
separately, but that trend is not in the data. Although the mean adequacy ratio
of both species is not significantly different, the mean shell adequacy ratio of
both P. samuelis and P. granosimanus actually increases when found together
indicating that shell adequacy improves in the zone in which both species co-
occur.
Wave action affects on shell adequacy
The proportion of hermit crabs with shell adequacies greater than one
in the exposed and semi-protected areas are not significantly different, but a
greater proportion of the P. granosimanus of the protected area have shell
adequacy ratios less than one than P. samuelis. The number one was used as
the arbitrary cut off point at which to compare those shells that were in
"poor" shells and "good" shells, but their was no method for checking the
exactness of the shell adequacy index.
