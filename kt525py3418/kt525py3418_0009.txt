Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
helping me answer the question and introducing me to the nitty gritty details
of research and writing scientific papers..
I would like to thank Edwardo Martinez for getting up for early morning tides
and making collecting entertaining, and for making the days "exciting"
Thank you to Alan Lam and Jill Snively for continual moral support
throughout the quarter, and making it one of the most memorable.
