Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
Introduction
Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanus are hermit crabs found
along the western coast of North America. Bollay (1964) reported that P.
samuelis was found consistently at higher tidal height than P. granosimanus.
More than 80% of the animals of both species of reproductive size are found in
shells of species of Tegula (Bollay 1964). Because both species of hermit crab
utilize Tegula spp. shells and Bollay reported that almost no empty inhabitable
shells were in the intertidal, it was hypothesized that the distribution of P.
samuelis and P. granosimanus is being maintained by interspecies
competition.
Competition can determine the way, where and how organisms live.
Vance (1972a) defined competition as "when two or more organisms seek a
common, necessary resource which occurs in insufficient supply to meet their
combined needs," and demonstrated that shell competition between Pagurus
granosimanus, Pagurus hirsiuticulus and Pagurus beringanus on the
Washington coast species affects the composition of a community and can be a
major limiting resource
A constant supply of shells are a necessary resource for hermit crabs.
The basic function of hermit crab’s shells is protection (Vance 1972b), but
inadequate shell size can decrease resistance to desiccation (Taylor 1981) and
predation (Vance 1972b), decrease fecundity (Bertness 1981b), and slow down
growth rate (Markham 1968). A constant supply of shells is needed so that
hermit crabs can move into adequate shells as they mature.
Although there was not enough time to investigate, all components of
competition, an investigation of shell competition and its potential influence
on intertidal segregation of P. samuelis and P. granosimanus was done in the
