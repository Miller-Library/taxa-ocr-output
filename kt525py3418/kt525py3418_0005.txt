Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
granosimanus in overlap and non-overlap areas were analyzed by Z-factor
ANOVA t-tests assuming unequal variances.
Results
Mark and Release Study
Äfter six weeks, the mark and release study yielded no mortality in
marked T. funebralis. Ten days after released, only 50 of the original 191
marked snails found after searching for an hour, and no marked hermit crabs
were found.
Between site comparisons
The population distribution of the crab body weight show that the P.
samuelis is slightly smaller than P. granosimanus at each area (Fig. 2-4). The
modal weights of the crabs are the same in the protected and semi-protected
areas, but in the exposed area the modal weight of the P. samuelis is larger
than P. granosimanus.
In the protected area, shell utilization patterns of both species of hermit
crab were skewed to larger shells than Tegula spp. and were significantly
different (Fig. 5). In the semi-protected area, the shell utilization patterns of
both P. samuelis and P. granosimanus were skewed to larger shells than Tegula
spp. and were also significantly different (Fig. 6). In the exposed area, shell
distributions of all three species were not significantly different (Fig. 7).
The equations from the shell adequacy indices are In crab weight -
3.1088 + 0.2020 x In shell width (p«0.001, r2-0.85) for P. granosimanus and In
crab weight = 3.1437 + 0.3159 x In shell width (p20.001, r2-0.89) for P. samuelis.
These slopes were significantly different (F= 18.87, p20.001).
In the protected area, P. samuelis and P. granosimanus have the same
modal shell adequacy ratio (Fig. 8), but the proportion of P. granosimanus in
