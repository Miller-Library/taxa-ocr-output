Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
Monterey Bay in May and April. Three aspects of shell resources were
examined: the rate of supply of shells, adequacy of hermit crab shells in
overlap and non-overlap zones and comparisons of shell adequacy in
different wave exposure sites.
Methods and Materials
Mark and Release
A mark and release study of live T. funebralis was done to determine the
supply rate of new shells into the hermit crab population. Specimens were
collected from a 0.25 m2. The T. funebralis shells were wiped with a paper
towel and allowed to dry. Then, a spot of enamel model paint (Testor) was
painted onto the shell, and after enamel dried, the snails were released into the
field.
Population studies
To determine the relationship between Tegula sizes and the shells that
hermit crabs occupy, collections were made from three locations in the rocky
intertidal zone off of China Point in the Monterey Bay in the months of May
and April (Fig. 1). Three locations were chosen for their varied wave action;
they were rocky areas by Agassiz Beach (protected), Hewett Transect (semiÂ¬
protected), and West Beach (exposed). All three locations had large algae
covered rocks surrounded by a loose substrate and sea grass.
At each site, quadrats were sampled every two meters along a transect
line running perpendicular to shore from -O.5 m (MLLW) to determine
vertical distribution of hermit crab species in each area. At the protected and
semi-protected areas, T. funebralis were collected from within a 0.25 m2 area,
and hermit crabs were collected for up to half an hour or until 50 hermit crabs
were collected. At the exposed area, the first 50 Tegula shells - indiscriminate
of whether it was a snail or a hermit crab - were collected.
