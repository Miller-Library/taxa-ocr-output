Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
In lab, maximum basal diameter of shells of the crabs and snails were
measured using venier calipers. Äfter blotting dry naked hermit crabs with a
paper towel, live body weight was measured.
A shell adequacy index was generated as described in Vance (1972a). In
a glass tank 9.5" x 12" x 17.5" with sand, Pelvetia, and constant circulation of
cold sea water, 50 P. samuelis were given five days to select an preferred sized
shell from 274 Tegula spp. shell. Then, live body weight of the crab and
maximum basal diameter of shells were measured. A linear regression was fit
to the logarithms of body weight and maximum basal diameter. The same
procedure using 56 P. granosimanus and 194 Tegula spp. shells was used to
determine a shell adequacy index for P. granosimanus.
The shell adequacy ratio was defined as maximum basal diameter of a
hermit crab’s shell in the field divided by the maximum basal diameter of the
calculated preferred size as estimated by the shell adequacy index. Shell
adequacy ratios less than one indicate that the shell a crab occupied in the
field was smaller than its preferred shell, and a shell adequacy ratio greater
than one indicate a crab occupied a shell greater than its preferred shell.
Differences between population size distribution were analyzed by non¬
parametric Kolmogorov-smirnov tests (Sokal & Rohlf, 1981), and Pearson chi¬
square tests were used to analyze shell adequacy ratios.
Interspecific competition
To investigate interspecies competition, hermit crab data from the semi¬
protected and protected areas were combined and resorted into areas where P.
samuelis and P. granosimanus co-occur and areas where they occur
separately. The exposed area data was excluded because of the difference of
collection method. The combined shell adequacy of P. samuelis and P.
