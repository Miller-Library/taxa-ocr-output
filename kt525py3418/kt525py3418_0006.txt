Kim, C. Shell adequacy of hermit crabs...
the protected area with adequacy indices less than one is significantly more
than the proportion of P. samuelis with adequacy indices less than one
(p=0.026, chi-square). In both the semi-protected and exposed areas, the
proportion of P. granosimanus and P. samuelis with adequacy indices less
than one were not significantly different (p-0.557 chi-square, p-0.620 chi¬
square respectively) (Fig. 9-10).
In a shell adequacy ratio versus maximum basal diameter of all data
combined, both P. samuelis and P. granosimanus were in the 0.8-1.2 range (Fig.
11) In both hermit crab species the animals with shell adequacies greater than
1.2 are in shells larger than 15 mm, and the hermit crabs with shell adequacies
less than .8 are in shells smaller than 15 mm.
Interspecific comparisons
Mean shell adequacy ratios of P. samuelis and P. granosimanus in areas
where they co-occur and where they occur alone are not significantly
different (p-O.O8ANOVA, p=0.06 ANOVA respectively) (Fig. 12-13).
Discussion
The shell adequacy of a hermit crab’s shell affects its resistance to
desiccation, protection against predation, its fecundity, and its growth rate,
making shells a common and necessary resource for P. samuelis and P.
granosimanus. Although further exploration is needed, but data suggests that
large P. samuelis and P. granosimanus are not shell limited. Shell adequacy
ratios imply that Interspecific competition between P. granosimanus and P.
samuelis around China point in the Monterey Bay area is not a major
contributor to the segregation observed in the field, and that wave action may
affect shell availability and adequacy of P. granosimanus and P. samuelis.
