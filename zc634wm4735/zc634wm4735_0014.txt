Further Research
To elucidate the effect of a high fat diet on tuna physiology, one
suggestion for further research is a longer treatment duration and a larger
sample size. There are other questions that need to be pursued to determine the
effect of high dietary fat content on the metabolism of a captive yellowfin tuna. In
a captive tuna, what amount of fat ingested is actually absorbed? What amount
is immediately utilized and what amount is stored? And how does this compare
to the fat utilization of wild tuna? And finally, is the threshold at which excess
calories are stored as lipid or glycogen similar in captive tuna as compared to
wild tuna?
The study of fat utilization in yellowfin tuna is pertinent to their feeding
strategy. Especially in the wild, where seasonal variations in prey availability and
nutritional content compound the bioenergetic gamble that yellowfin tuna play,
there is potential for diet to influence metabolism and other physiological
processes.
