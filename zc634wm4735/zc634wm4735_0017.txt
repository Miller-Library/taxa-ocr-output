Acknowledgements
This project was dependent on the generous help of many
workers from Hopkins Marine Station and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium, to whom I owe much gratitude. I would especially like to
thank my advisors, Dr. Barbara Block and Chuck Farwell, for their
quidance, Ellen Freund for her advice and the use of her equipment,
Heidi Dewar for the use of her minilog probes, and Doug Fudge for his
patience and technical support.
