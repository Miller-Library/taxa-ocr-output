Figure 1: Caloric composition (kcal/100g) of different size classes of
squid, smelt and sardines. Results from bomb calorimetry
analysis.
Figure 2: Total calories and caloric composition of Low Fat and High
Fat Diet treatments in kcal/kg/day.
Figure 3: Results from the Closed-system respirometer for Low Fat
and High Fat Diets are plotted as oxygen consumption to activity
(or swimming velocity). Two fish, short yellow and black base,
were repeat trial subjects across the change in diet. (Each
individual fish is identified by tag description.)
Figure 4: The average oxygen consumption and swimming
velocity for each diet treatment from the Closed-system
respirometer.
Figure 6: Results from Closed-system respirometer are compared with
previously published results (Dewar and Graham, 1984)
collected in a water tunnel where swimming velocity could be
controlled. The average fork length of Diet-manipulated fish was
54.2 cm.
Figure 6: By using T2 as an Open-system respirometer for over 36
hours and subtracting out baseline (non-absorbtive, inactive
respiration, oxygen consumption demonstrates the sharp
increase after feeding (absorbtive state) that gradually returns to
baseline values for both Low Fat (LFD) and High Fat Diet (HFD).
Duration may be too short to observe full return to baseline in
HFD.
Figure 7: Stomach Temperature measurements for the Low Fat and
High Fat Diets demonstrate a significant difference between preÂ¬
and post-feeding (LFD p=0.003; HFD p=0.05) but no significant
differences between diet treatments (pre-feed p=0.91; post-feed
p-0.80).
