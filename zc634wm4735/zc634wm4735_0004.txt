substrate concentration suggests a change in the metabolic cost of digestion
and storage as different substrates follow different biochemical pathways
(Schmidt-Neilsen, pgs. 145-150, 157-159). By increasing the lipid content but
maintaining a low total caloric value, the effect of a high fat diet on tuna
metabolism can be determined. Oxygen consumption and internal heat
increment are two indicators of metabolism (Schmidt-Neilsen, pgs. 178 - 179)
and can be measured using respirometry (Cech, pgs. 335 - 336) and minilog
temperature probes to gauge any effect of diet treatment.
Materials and Methods
At the TRCC, yellowfin tuna, caught off of Southern California, have been
successfully maintained in captivity. One tank, T2, (29,000 gallons) holds
twenty-eight experimental fish for Hopkins Marine Station. The water
temperature is kept at 21-22Â°C and the tunas are fed roughly 3 - 4% of their
body weight (Chuck Farwell, personal communication), three times a week. Body
mass was estimated from fork length measurements:
Weight = 0.0000407752 fork length?3.02
Eight smaller fish (mean mass = 3.55 kg, mean fork length = 56.51 cm),
designated as respirometry fish, were marked with yellow tags for identification.
Diet manipulation
To determine the effect of a high fat diet on tuna metabolic rate, two diet
treatments were designed. The composition of the low fat diet (LFD) was a
continuation of the regular TRCC diet - 82% squid and 18% smelt by wet mass.
