lo correct for any increase in oxygen consumption due to increased
activity, runs were videotaped and swimming velocity was measured as time in
seconds it took a fish to swim a marked distance on the tank (average of ten
passes).
Open-System Respiromety
12 was used as an Open or Flow Through respirometer to measure
oxygen consumption of the entire population of fish in the tank (Cech, pgs. 347 -
348). A monitoring system (Program Logic Control), installed in each tank at the
TRCC by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, provided data on the levels of dissolved
oxygen in the out-flowing water of T2. The values were subtracted from in¬
flowing oxygen levels to calculate oxygen consumption. In-flowing oxygen levels
were approximated from the relationship drawn between temperature and
dissolved oxygen. Appendix 1. In-flowing water, from the Monterey Bay
Aquarium water tower, was assumed to be 100% saturated (Chuck Farwell,
personal communication) and oxygen levels were calculated accordingly,
dependent on water temperature.
Whole tank respiration was calculated using the following equation
(Gooding et al., 1981):
Vo2 (mg 021 kg per hour) = (102 inl -102 outl)* Flow
N* mass“ (1-exp(-Elow ' time)
volume
Flow = rate of exchange
volume = tank (109,765 liters)
Time = 1 hour
N = number of fish
mass = mean body mass of fish (4.9 kg)
