The high fat diet (HFD) was composed of 100% sardines. Twenty-five
specimens each of squid, sardines, and smelt were weighed to calculate
average mass. To correct for a large variation from mean mass, squid and
sardines were separated into different size classes. Five specimens of each
group were sent to the Michelson laboratories for bomb calorimetry analyses
which measured total caloric content (kcall100 g) and percent fat, protein, and
carbohydrate. Based on these values and biomass of tank, treatments were
modified to keep total calories constant across diets (28 kcallkg/day) while
differences in fat content (LFD « 1%; HFD = 8%) could be manipulated. At 21 -
22°C, the calorie level was low enough to ensure a minimal growth rate over
experiment duration (Chuck Farwell, personal communication).
Consideration was taken in food preparation to account for size
differences of fish. Food was cut into pieces suitable for the smallest fish in T2 to
ensure that all fish were eating.
Closed-System Respirometry
A Closed System respirometer (Gooding et al, 1981, Cech, pgs. 343-345)
was used to measure routine metabolic rate of tuna under the different diet
treatments. An oxygen probe (Yellow Springs Instrument 5739 probe, attached
to a YSl 52 Dissolved Oxygen Meter) measured dissolved oxygen within the oval
tank (1,237 L). To minimize errors due to gas exchange at the waterlair
interface, all air bubbles were removed before sealing the acrylic lid to the
closed-cell foam gasket. Oxygen data was logged in spreadsheet form on a
computer.
