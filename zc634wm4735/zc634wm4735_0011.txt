Discussion
By using oxygen consumption and stomach temperature as indicators of
metabolism, it was determined that no significant difference could be measured
between diet treatments. When an analysis of variance (ANÖVA) was
calculated, the variation within groups was found to be the majority of the total
variation of individual respirometry trials and thermal excess measurements.
Because of such a large variance within groups, the power of these statistical
analyses is very small (Sokal and Rohlf, pgs. 260-265). A larger sample size will
increase the sensitivity of statistical tests in determining whether the insignificant
differences are actually due to no effect from treatments or if the difference is too
small for detection without a high power test.
There was a trend in the whole tank respiration that indicated a
longer period of elevated oxygen consumption after a HFD feeding that could
indicate a higher oxygen consumption during digestion for a HFD. This trend in
post-feeding oxygen consumption (n = 1) can not be accepted as representative
without further trials. Because of the ambiguities due to variables such as small
sample size, gas exchange at the air and water interface, and outside stimuli,
the results of a high fat diet change on the metabolism of a captive yellowfin
tuna are inconclusive
Digestion of different metabolites are only few of many variables that will
influence metabolism, or the total use of energy in a system. Öther variables
that will affect the rate of energy utilization in a captive yellowfin tuna include
activity levels, oxygen availability, body size, hormones, and temperature in an
