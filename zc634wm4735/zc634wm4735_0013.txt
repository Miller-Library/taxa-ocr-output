of oxygen consumed on the high fat diet which may be offset by the fact that
more energy is being expended on the low fat diet to store excess calories as
fat. As a metabolite, fat contains twice the caloric content as protein or
carbohydrate (fat = 9.4 kcallg, protein = 4.3 kcallg, carbohydrate = 4.2 kcallg).
But, it also requires less energy to convert dietary fats than proteins or
carbohydrates into lipid stores (Schmidt-Neilsen, pg. 179). This is one
reasonable explaination for the insignificant results measured.
It is possible that the lack of any measurable differences in oxygen
consumption or stomach temperature may be due to the short length of the diet
treatment. The duration of the high fat feedings (5 weeks) may have been too
brief to elicit a physiological change in tuna metabolism. If there was a change,
the difference may have been too small for the sensitivity of the experiment and
statistical tests to quantify.
Data from free fatty acid assays of blood serum (Fletcher, 1997), sampled
from T2 at the end of each treatment, does indicate a physiological effect of the
increase in dietary fat content. As compared to samples taken from the low fat
feedings, levels of free fatty acids increased in samples taken after a 36 hour
fast after the 5 weeks of high fat feedings. This would suggest that more free
fatty acids are available both for storage and utilization and may influence the
metabolism of the captive tuna at levels of food stuff oxidation and energy
storage in lipid accumulation. Again, we must consider the multiple factors that
cause an increase in free fatty acids concentrations in blood serum, including
increased activity and starvation. (Stryer, pgs. 634 - 640)
