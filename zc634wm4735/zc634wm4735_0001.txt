Tuna Metabolism and Physiology in Captive Yellowfin Tuna (Thunnus
albacares
Abstract
At the Tuna Research and Conservation Center, in Monterey
California, captive yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares ) demonstrated an
increase in lipid accumulation and mortalities when fed a high calorie and
high fat diet. To determine what influence a high fat diet has on tuna
physiology, one tank (T2) holding 28 fish was designated for diet
manipulation while oxygen consumption and stomach temperatures were
used to measure changes in metabolism. No significant differences in
metabolic rate were measured between diet treatments. The low fat diet (LFD;
Â«1% fat content in kcal) was composed of squid and smelt while the high fat
diet (HFD; 8% fat content in kcal) only included sardines. Samples were sent
away for bomb calorimetry analysis and based on these values, an equivalent
total caloric level (28 kcal/kg/day) was maintained between diets. Individual
respirometry trials were performed in a Closed-system respirometer. Three
trials were run for each diet treatment and swimming velocity was measured
for each run to calculate standard metabolic rate (LFD: 135.70 +/- 42.79 m,
02/kg/hr; HFD: 147.54 +/- 8.89 mg 02/kg/hr; p-0.80). Whole tank metabolic
rate was measured using T2 as an Open-system respirometer with help from
the dissolved oxygen monitoring system (Program Logic Control) operated by
Monterey Bay Aquarium. Stomach temperature was measured by minilog
temperature probes and no significant difference between diets was measured
(pre-feed: p=0.91; post-feed: p-0.80).
