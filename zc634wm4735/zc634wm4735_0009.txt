the Bureau of Standards thermometer.

Diet Analysis
Based on data from the bomb calorimetry analysis, the total caloric
content and percent composition of different food types was shoun to vary
greatly towards a higher percentage of fat in sardines. Figure 1. The LFD was
composed mainly of squid and smelt while the HFD was composed only of
sardines. Though each diet was of equivalent caloric value (28 kcallkg/day), the
LFD was 1% fat (s1 kcal of fat/kg/day) as compared to the HFD which was 8%
fat (2.56 kcallkg/day). Figure 2.
Closed-system Respirometyy
Rate of uptake (mg O2/ kghr') was averaged from the last six runs of each
trial. Table 1. Differences in activity between fish were corrected for by graphing
oxygen consumption as a function of velocity (body lengths/second). Velocity
was measured as both centimeters per second and body lengths per second.
Oxygen consumption increased with increasing swimming speed. Figure 3. A
regression was calculated for each trial (due to erratic behavior and swimming
speeds, one trial from each treatment was discarded from the comparison (n -
2)) and extrapolated to O swimming speed (cm/s) to obtain standard metabolic
rate (LFD : 135.7 +- 30.26 mg OÃ¸/hr.kg; HFD : 147.54 +- 6.29 mg O2/hr.kg) A
comparison across diets shows no significant differences due to treatments (p =
