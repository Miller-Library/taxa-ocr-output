0.80). Table 2. The trial averages from each diet were combined and expressed
as oxygen consumption against swimming velocity which shows no difference
between the two treatment levels. Figure 4.
The results from each individual trial was also compared to previously
published results by Dewar and Graham, 1994, taken in a water tunnel where
swimming speed could be controlled. The values for these six trials were lower
than others at equivalent swimming speeds. Size may be influencing results
(mean fork length = 54.2 cm: Dewar and Graham mean fork length (largest size
class) = 51 cm). Figure 5.
Open-system Respirometyy
The LFD returns to baseline metabolic rate at approximately 34 hours
after feeding while the high fat feeding does not return to original level before 36
hours after feeding. Figure 6. The ratio of the area under each curve for HFD
and LFD whole tank respiration is 1.003. The high fat feeding shows a trend
towards a longer recovery period or longer duration of elevated oxygen
consumption.
Stomach Temperature Measurements
Though pre-feeding and post-feeding measurements within each diet
were statistically different, LFD and HFD means of the thermal excess
measurements were not significantly different. (LFD pre-feed: 0.26 +/- 004 ?C
thermal excess; LFD post-feed 0.46 +-0.03 °C; HFD pre-feed = 0.26+/- 0.025
•C. HFD O.44 +0.02 °C) (p value 0.08) Figure 7.
