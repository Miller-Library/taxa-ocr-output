Approximately 36 hours after a feeding, a yellow tagged fish was netted or
captured in a sling from T2, placed in the respirometer and allowed to recover
from any handling stress for about three hours. Outside stimuli were controlled
by shielding the tank with a black curtain and keeping the noise level to a
minimum. Before the high fat trials, a blue gel was placed over the light that
illuminated the tank to further decrease stress levels.
Six trials were run (n = 3 per diet treatment). Metabolic rate was
measured by stopping flow through the tank and allowing the dissolved oxygen
level to fall over time (60 minutes). Oxygen level was maintained above 80%
saturation at all times. Between runs, flow to the tank was restored for 30
minutes and the dissolved oxygen levels were allowed to return to at least 90%
saturation to avoid stressing the fish (Cech, pg. 345). Total trial duration
averaged twelve hours for each fish. The first two runs of each trial were
disregarded due to the elevated rate of oxygen consumption attributed to stress
of capture and placement in the respirometer.
A regression was calculated from dissolved oxygen level as a function of
time for each trial using the last six runs - the first two runs ignored due to
interfering stress response. The slope of the regression was used to calculate
rate of oxygen consumption:
Vo2 (mg Olkg per hour) - slope * time' volume
mass
mass = body mass of fish
time = trial duration - 60 minutes
volume = tank volume - 1,237 liters
