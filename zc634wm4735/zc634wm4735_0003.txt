stomachs is large enough (280%) to suggest that yellowfin tuna are feeding on a
diet with adequate lipid content, as most fish species are higher in fat content
than other prey, such as cephalopods (Chuck Farwell, personal communication)
A study in sled dogs suggests that a high fat diet will increase the plasma
concentrations of free fatty acids, especially after exercise. Äfter a high level of
aerobic activity, the levels of free fatty acids in blood have been shown to
increase in actively training sled dogs (Reynolds et al., 1994) and in another
fish, the Arctic Char (Barton et al., 1995). Both studies suggest that an increase
in free fatty acid concentration in circulating blood promotes uptake and
oxidation especially in animals with high energy demands.
At the Tuna Research and Conservation Center (TRCC) in Monterey,
California, it has been a challenge to design a diet that fits the nutritional needs
of confined yellowfin tunas. Initially (September, 1994, to March, 1995), the
tunas were fed a diet of squid, sardines, and anchovies (total calories = 80
kcallkg/day) twice daily. This diet, high in both fat and calories, resulted in an
increase in lipid accumulation (in muscle tissue) and related mortalities. By
decreasing fat content and total calories fed, a decrease in intra-muscular lipid
accumulation and mortality rate was demonstrated (Perla, unpublished - 1995).
Currently, the diet consists of 82% squid and 18% smelt by wet mass and is low
in both total calories and dietary fat content (total calories = 28 kcallkglday, fat
content « 1%).
The low fat diet fed to captive yellowfin tuna at the TRCC could result in a
decrease in the availability of lipid metabolites to use and store. This change in
