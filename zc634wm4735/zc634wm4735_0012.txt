abbreviated list (Jobling, pgs. 121-145, Schmidt-Neilsen, pgs. 177-218). Even a
post-feeding increase in oxygen consumption and thermal excess is due to
multiple factors such as the energy dependent processes of metabolite
degradation, storage of excess calories, and to a small extent, mechanical work
of digestive organs (Carey et al., 1984).
Ã„fter an increase in dietary fat intake, there are three possible ways in
which we may expect metabolism to change; it may increase, decrease or
remain constant. The metabolic rate of the captive tuna may increase due to the
higher energy cost of fat oxidation and the availability of high energy metabolites
circulating in the blood stream, promoting the use of lipids rather than glycogen
as fuel. Since the degradation of fatty acids is dependent on low ATP levels,
high activity levels may increase the energy spent in oxidation which in turn may
increase metabolic rate (Stryer, pg. 628 - 629). Metabolism may remain constant
due the higher vield of energy from fat; it requires the oxidation of less fat than
other metabolites to gain an equivalent amount of energy (Schmidt-Neilsen, pgs.
178-180), Finally, there is a possibility that metabolism will decrease due to the
lower energy cost of converting ingested fat into free fatty acids (Jobling, pgs.
66-68) in comparison to protein or carbohydrate being first degraded into
intermediates (Acetyl Coenzyme A) and then converted to free fatty acids
(Lehninger, Nelson and Cox, pgs. 642-685).
Since the metabolic rate remained fairly constant across treatment levels,
then the lack of measurable difference could suggest that an equal amount of
total energy is being metabolized on both diets. This would increase the amount
