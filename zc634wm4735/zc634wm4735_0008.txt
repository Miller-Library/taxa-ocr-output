Background metabolic rate was subtracted and a comparison of post-feeding
increase in oxygen consumption made between diets. Feeding event was plotted
as hour Ã– and the areas under each curve were used to approximate total
oxygen consumed.
Stomach temperature measurements
Minilog temperature probes were used to record stomach temperature.
The probes were inserted into pieces of food, either sutured into the mantle
cavity of a squid or into a piece of sardine, to insure ingestion upon introduction
to the tank. The tuna would periodically evacuate their stomachs and the probes
could then be retrieved from the bottom of the tank and the temperature
measurements downloaded. Temperature probes recorded measurements at 3
minute intervals and remained in the fish for a mean duration of 2 days. The
maximum time between ingestion and evacuation was 6 days.
The stomach temperature measurements were converted to thermal
excess by subtracting the temperature measurements recorded from a minilog
probe suspended in the tank to record ambient water temperature. Fluctuations
in water temperature, due to the heating system, did not affect the internal
temperature of the fish immediately (Heidi Dewar, personal communication). A
lag period of 24 minutes, between changes in water and stomach temperatures,
approximated a best fit.
Calibrations
All oxygen probes were calibrated against Hach Winkler titrations which
are accurate to 0.2 mgll. Miniloggers and all other temperature probes used
