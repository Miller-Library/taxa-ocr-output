A number of algae available to Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson,
1862) for food contain a high concentration of D-galactose in the form
of O-D-galactopyranosides of glycerol (1) and polysaccharides. The
possession of the necessary enzymes for the conversion of galactose
into glucose would facilitate the use of those algae as a food source.
Such a system has been found in yeast, bacteria, in the mammalian liver,
and blood (2,3,4,5,6). The reaction is catalyzed by uridine diphosphate
glucose epimerase (UDPG epimerase). To show the existence of a similar
system in P. samuelis, two steps were necessary. The first involved
finding the important sites of glycogen deposition in the animal and the
amount of turnover of glycogen at these sites. The hepatopancreas and
abdominal muscle were selected for examination, because of their acces-
sability in the animal. Finally, carbon-14 labelled glucose and gal-
actose were used to determine the existence of UDPG epimerase, and also
to determine the rate of glucose incorporation in glycogen synthesis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
All crabs used for the glycogen determination were collected
from a ten-yard square area on the grounds of Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, California, with the exception of the animals used for
the starvation experiment, which were collected at Point Pinos, a few
miles from the station. The hepatopancreas and the large abdominal
muscle were removed within one hour of collection and were dehydrated
in acetone overnight. The acetone was evaporated and the tissue homo-
genized in 107 trichloroacetic acid (TCA), 0.5 ml. TCA for every 50 mg.
