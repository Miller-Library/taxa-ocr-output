would serve to maintain the blood sugar level while also increasing the
concentration of glycogen in the muscle. The results of this experi-
ment point to this sort of mechanism in P. samuelis.
The labelling experiments suggest the presence of a system
which ultimately leads to the conversion of D-galactose into glycogen.
The small difference between the glucose and galactose incorporation
results suggests a sparing effect by the unlabelled glucose in the crab
ringers solution.
SUDRART
The glycogen levels for the hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle of
Pagurus samuelis are between 0.327 and 6.77 and between 0.0647 and
0.58% of dry weight, respectively.
During starvation the mean percent glycogen by dry weight decreases
from 2.47 to 1.37 in the hepatopancreas and increases from 0.27 to
1.27 in the abdominal muscle.
The presence of UDPG epimerase or similar mechanism for the conver-
sion of D-galactose into D-glucose is suggested.
