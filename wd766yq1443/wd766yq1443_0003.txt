of dry tissue. This was centrifuged at 4000 rpm and 3-5° C. for 15
minutes and the supernatant was drawn off with a capillary pipette.
The precipitate was washed with one-half the previous volume of TCA
and recentrifuged. One volume of 957 ethanol was added to the com¬
bined supernatant and the glycogen allowed to precipitate in the re¬
frigerator overnight. It was redissolved in water for the determination
of total carbohydrate.
Carbohydrate was determined by the method of Dubois, et al
(7), and was based upon a standard curve prepared between 10 and 100
micrograms glucose per milliliter of water.
For the labelling experiments, the hepatopancreas from two
crabs were dissected, minced with cuticle scissors, and divided into
two portions. To the first was added 0.02 microcuries of D-glucose-
1-C-14 and to the second was added 0.02 microcuries of D-galactose-2-
C-14. Both portions of tissue were incubated for one hour in 1 ml. of
crab ringers solution (8) at 13° C. After incubation the tissue was
dehydrated in acetone and homogenized in 0.5 ml. of 107 TCA. To aid
in the precipitation of glycogen, 2.5 mg. of glycogen were dissolved
in the 0.5 ml. TCA used to wash the precipitate. 1.0 ml. of ethanol
was added, and the precipitation allowed to occur overnight. The gly¬
cogen was then dissolved in 1.0 ml. water and the precipitation with
alcohol repeated two more times to purify the product. The final pre-
cipitate was dissolved in 2ml, of water and the carbon-14 content determ-
ined with a Nuclear-Chicago gas flow counter, model D-47 with mica win-
dow, and equipped with scaling unit model 161A.
