RESULTS
Table I summarizes the glycogen determinations run on normal
crabs. The hepatopancreas was found to contain more glycogen than the
muscle, although great variability was obtained for both tissues.
The results of the starvation experiment are shown in Table
II. A significant decrease in hepatopancreas glycogen from those values
shown in Table I was observed.
Only low activity was encountered in the labelling experiments.
The net counts above background were 13.8 cpm for glucose incorporation
and 28.4 cpm for the galactose experiment. However, the glycogen was
highly purified and a sufficient number of counts were taken to make
these figures significant. The crab ringers contained an equivalent
amount of non-labelled glucose
DISCUSSION
The variation found in glycogen concentration in the hepato-
pancreas and the mean concentration agree with similar observations
made on other decapod crustacea (9). The variation has been found to
be a result of physiological changes during the molting cycle (10).
The starved crabs have demonstrated a similar reaction as
that of starved vertebrates (11), where the energy yielding materials
tend to be concentrated at the site where they are required. Normally,
glycogen is continually being broken down in the muscle at the expense
of free glucose in the blood. This in turn would draw upon reserves in
the hepatopancreas. When these reserves diminish, as during starvation,
the concentration of free glucose instheeblood also decreases. In ver-
tebrates, a net decreased consumption of glycogen in the muscle tissues
