like tolerance to desiccation, must play an important role
in choosing a limpet's habitat (Branch, 1981).
One author points out that desiccation times in the lab
are generally longer than any time that is seen in the field
(Underwood, 1979). This is certainly true for the C. digitalis
tested in my lab. They survived up to 116 hours without water
and it is rare that they would be subjected to this length of
exposure in the field. During their 20 hours of exposure.
these limpets performed well. Death seemed to occur in the
limpets at about 20-257 total weight loss but the most these
limpets experienced during one 20 hour exposure was 10-157 weight
loss. However, during period 5 when the limpets were exposed
for longer than 20 hours, these limits were clearly approached
by Group .5 limpets. Following repetitive exposure with only
a minimal amount of water, the effects of cumulative stress
became evidently detrimental to these limpets.
In thinking about what could happen in nature, one could
imagine a period of time in which high intertidal limpets re-
ceived only one half hour of water daily and then suddenly re-
ceived less or no water for a period of time. Kills reported
in the field were often preceded by warm weather, or,more....
importantly, low surf, and usually involved those limpets at
the upper limits of their ranges (Wolcott, 1973). Limpets
in these cases seemed to have overestimated their tolerance to
a series of exposures. Windless weather and low surf would
provide little or no water in which to recover.
It is also possible to imagine limpets receiving no water
for a period of time and then suddenly receiving 2 to 4 hours
of submergence by either high tides or wash by waves. If the
