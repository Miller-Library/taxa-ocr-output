INTRODUCTION
The high intertidal limpet, Collisella digitalis, has
often been cited for its remarkable ability to withstand long
periods of desiccation. Research done by Wolcott (1973) reveals
that this limpet can survive a loss of 80% total water when
desiccated under moderate conditions. Information such as
this is useful when comparing C. digitalis' tolerance to desic
cation with lower intertidal limpets and trying to explain
limpet zonation. However, often in the field, it is not just
one day or one short stretch of days with unusually warm weather
and/or low low tidesthat cause kills, but a series of days of
moderate stresses that accumulatively weaken the organism
(Branch, 1981). C. digitalis is certainly found in areas where
it could be subjected to these types of stresses,
With this in mind, it should be pointed out that along with
C. digitalis' remarkable ability to withstand long periods of
desiccation, it must also possess an equally remarkable ability
to recover safely and rapidly from water loss. Experiments
were designed to examine the patterns of water balance with
sets of repeated desiccation stress of 20 hours followed by
different periods of submergence for recovery. The time course
for equilibration of the osmotic concentration of the body
fluids after a desiccation stress was also evaluated. Equili-
bration was monitored for two sets of limpets, one continuously
submerged and another removed to air after .7 hours of subÂ¬
mergence.
Little research has been done in assessing recovery time.
