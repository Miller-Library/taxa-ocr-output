Weight loss vs. time of period 1 and Group 4/ period 5.
W/W(i) represents the fraction of the initial weight at
any given time. Each period of weight loss follows a 4
hour submergence. (correlation coefficient, r2 (period 1) -
79, r2 (period 5) = .93).
2. Weight loss vs. time of period 1 and Group 4/periods 3 and
5, showing, the progression of weight loss over.5 exposure
periods (r(period 3) -.97).
3. Weight loss vs. time of period 1 and Group 2/period 5.
Period 5 weight loss follows a 2 hour submergence. (r2 period
5 -.97).
4.Weight loss vs. time of period 1 and Group .5/period 5.
Period 5 weight loss follows a .5 hour submergence. (r2 period
5 = .97).
5. Weight loss vs. time of period 1 and Groups .5, 2, and 4/
period 5 with extended time to show significant difference
of period 1 and Group .5/period 5.
6. Osmotic equilibration of digit
lis with sea water after
a 13-15% total weight loss. Removal of half the population
from sea water occurred at .7 hours.
