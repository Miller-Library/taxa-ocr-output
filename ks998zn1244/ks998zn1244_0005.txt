All limpets were submerged for 4 hours before the first
period of exposure. Following this, the limpets were exposed
for 5 periods of desiccation with different submergence times,
Group .5 limpets were submerged .5 hours after each 20 hour
desiccation period. Group 2 limpets were submerged 2 hours
after each 20 hour period. Group 4 limpets were submerged
4 hours after each 20 hour period. Group O limpets were not r
submerged following the first submergence until 116 hours after
the exposure.
The limpets were submerged by placing the petri dishes
in a bath of running sea water. Following each submergence,
the dish and the limpet were blotted dry and weighed on a
Mettler balance to one hundredth of a gram. The initial
weight W(i) was the weight of the limpets following the first
submergence. During the time of exposure the limpets were
weighed periodically until the next time of submergence,
Period 5 was the last exposure period for Groups ,5, 2.
and 4. Weight loss of limpets was then followed for 60 hours,
After 116 hours of desiccation, Group 0 limpets were submerged
in water and their weight gain was measured over 24 hours.
Weight loss for each group was analyzed by taking the
fraction of weight left after a period of time, W/W(i), where
W(i) is the initial weight at time O of the first period of -
exposure. Since heat absorption and hence, evaporation rate,
is proportional to the surface area of the limpet (Branch, 1981).
W/W(i) was then normalized with respect to the total surface
area (Total surface area - Trr2 + h2 + Ir2). This method takes
into account the perimeter of the shell through which water is
