lost (Wolcott, 1973). The method is:
) (Normalized) - Wo - aw
3/W(i)
Wo is the weight of the limpet at time O at the beginning of
each exposure period, AW is the water weight loss, S, is the
average surface area of the limpets and Si is the surface area
of a given limpet. The mean of this W/W(i) was then determined
at each time and plotted,
Since weight loss during period 1 was the same for all
groups, their rates were pooled together. Using least square
fit, the values for the slopes (rate of desiccation) for the
exponential weight loss were determined. Slopes for period 1.
pooled and by group, are given in Results.
Experiment 2:
Limpets of similar sizes were collected at Pt. Pinos.
Monterey County, California, and desiccated to 13-15% total
weight loss. At that time mantle and body water was collected
from 6 limpets to determine osmolarity. The limpets were then
submerged in a bath of running sea water for .7 hours. Body
and mantle water samples were collected again from 6 limpets.
Half of the population was then removed from water and left at
room temperature. The other half was left in the sea water,
Samples were collected periodically from both populations for
10 hours.
Mantle water was extracted by gently squeezing the foot.
Body fluid was obtained by slitting the bottom of the foot and
extracting fluid with a microhematocrit capillary tube, These
