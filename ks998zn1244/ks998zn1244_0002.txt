ABSTRAC
This study focused on the temporal pattern of recovery from
desiccation stress in the high intertidal limpet, Collisella
digitalis. Experiments were done on the effects of cumulative
desiccation on groups of limpets with different submergence
periods in between exposure periods. Results showed that
limpets submerged for : .5 hours between repeated desiccation
periods had an increased rate of weight loss after a series
of 5 exposures. Limpets submerged for 4 hours between stresses
exhibited weight gain during the experiment while 2 hours
of submergence resulted in no significant weight changes.
When limpets with a desiccation stress of 157 weight loss
were allowed to equilibrate with sea water, a period of 2
hours was required for osmotic equilibration of the body
fluid. More prolonged submergence of desiccated individuals
results in an overshoot of weight recovery at osmotic equiliÂ¬
bration. The data suggests that not only does recovery
time play an important role in determining the upper limits
of the intertidal distribution of C. digitalis, but may also
determine the lower limits as well.
