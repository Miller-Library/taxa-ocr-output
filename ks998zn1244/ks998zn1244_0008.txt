Limpets submerged for .5 hours/20 hours (Figure 4) showed
a significant increase in the rate of weight loss during period 5
(mj-.010f.0007 (group .5 alone)/.0093 t.001 (pooled), mg-.0174.0023).
Weight at time 0/period 5 was slightly lower than t-o /period 1:
limpets, on average, weighed .984t.013 x lower than their initial
weight, W(i).
Figure 5 compares the pooled weight loss of period 1 for
all groups, including Group 0, and the extended time of period 5
of Groups .5, 2, and 4. The rate of desiccation of Group ,5 is
clearly greater than the other groups as described above. The high
standard deviation of the mean of this group can be accounted
for by 2 limpets that had died as their time of exposure increased.
This, too, was evaluated as a sign of accumulative stress. The
rate of weight loss of period 5 of Groups 2 and 4, as discussed:
above, are not significantly different from period 1.
Group O limpets that were placed in sea water following
hours of desiccation showed increases in weight up to 1.0574.016 x
their original weight after 10 hours submergence,
Experiment 2:
Osmolarity for limpets following 13-157 total weight loss
was high as expected (1450 mOsm/1 H20). Following .7 hours of
submergence, mantle water was 970 mOsm/1 H90 (sea water) and
body water osmolarity had dropped to 1100 mOsm/ 1 H20. The
body osmolarity of the population removed from sea water staved
at around 1100 mOsm/1 H20 and the mantle water rose to 1150 mOsm/
1 H20.
The body water of the population in sea water kept dropping,
but had not reached sea water osmolarity at 1.3 hours. Body osmoÂ¬
