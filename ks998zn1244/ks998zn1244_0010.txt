cations, exhibited a bloating of 1.06 x their original weight.
One author attributes this process ofswelling to a rapid intake
of water through the gut in Notoacmae scutum and suggests that
this form of uptake allows a more rapid recovery to normal
volume (Webber 1969). Possibly the bloating is due to the
high concentration difference between body osmolarity and sea
water at the time of submergence. In either case, the rapid
weight gain would seem to add a second stress. In the field.
this swelling could create a loss of tenacity on the substrate
(Boggs, 1985). Since the lower limits of C. digitalis do not
seem to fall below an intertidal height where more than 4 hours
of submergence are experienced daily, it would appear that
digitalis' lower limits are being set by this factor, a sug
gestion first made by Hoffman (1976).
The weight gain of Group 2 did not significantly rise or
fall below the initial weight. This group would have had time
to both equilibrate and regain lost water. Their rate of weight
loss did not change from one period to the next, and, unlike
Group 4, this group did not experience the excessive swelling
of Group 4. The 2 hour period of submersion would appear
close to the ideal time for these limpets following 13-157
total weight loss. In fact, a study done on another mid inter-
tidal' limpet, Patella vulgata, showed that after 1.9% water
loss, it took 1.8 hours for the species to recover water (Davies,
1969). With only a slight loss of water, these limpets took
nearly the same time to recover as the digitalis in the previous
experiments where water loss was five to ten times as great.
It is unclear whether this recovery time included osmotic
equilibration, but it certainly suggests that recovery time,
