APPRECIATION
In preparing this study I owe many thanks to many people:
Dr. William Gilly for entrusting me with his sacred Osmometer
and spatulas, Dr. Mark Denny for the use of his computer and
his enthusiasm all along, Mr. Thomas Hahn for his help in
collecting limpets and improving my vocabulary, Mr. Peter
Thompson for his analytical abilities and high tolerance /
rapid recovery to my abuse, Charles Baxter for his suggestions
and patience and chili, and all those other spring class
whim-pets that made 175H really worth it.
