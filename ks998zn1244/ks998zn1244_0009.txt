larity equilibrated with sea water between 1.3 and 2.3 hours
after submergence. After this time, body osmolarity dropped
slightly below sea water osmolarity.
DISCUSSION
It is helpful to think of the groups as occupying different
positions in the intertidal, starting with Group 4 in the lowest
position, Group 2 in the middle, and Group .5 in the highest.
Presumably as one goes higher into the intertidal, time for
recovery decreases and chances for longer periods of desiccation
increase (Davies, 1969). Above the level of the low high tide
to the neap high tide, there is not much difference in the
increased exposure time for desiccation but this study shows
there to be a great impact in the different, times of submergence
with respect to water and salt balance. In assessing recovery.
it is important to look at both the way the limpets regain weight
after a period of exposure and how theyosmotically equilibrate
after a certain weight loss. Without the full time for recovery.
one would expect a gradual increase in weight loss.
Group .5 nicely supports this prediction. If sea water
equilibration time lies somewhere between 1.3 and 2.3 hours.
than Group .5 did not have quite enough time to either equilibrate
or regain the weight lost over a series of exposures. This, in
turn, had a marked effect on the final period of prolonged expo-
sure when the rate of weight loss was significantly increased.
Although 4 hour submergence is enough time in which to
equilibrate with sea water, Group 4 appears to regain too much
weight during this time. The limpets, following repeated desic-
