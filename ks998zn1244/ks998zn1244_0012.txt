rate of water gain is rapid and uncontrollable, than the bloating
could also become dangerous. The problems associated with des¬
iccation could entail new problems with recovery. When Group O
limpets were finally submerged following 116 hours of exposure,
none exhibited rapid and normal recovery. They swelled up to
1.05x their original weight within 4 hours and did not return
to normal weight until approximately 15-20 hours after submer-
gence. Most of the limpets seemed severely weakened; by this
I mean that none of the limpets left their petri dishes when
placed in the water, as is normal, and four out of six of them
died two days later. It appears as though simply submerging
the limpets for a long period of time after an extensive exposure
does not lead to recovery. Rather, there seems to be an ideal
time of water submergence for C. digitalis which could further
explain their ranges in the intertidal zone,
More experiments of this type are needed to support these
findings. Limpets could be stressed for longer periods of time,
Osmotic and volume equilibration with sea water also needs
further testing because of the problems associated with deter¬
mining osmolarity of viscous body fluids. However, these
observations do tend to support the idea that an interactfon
between desiccation tolerated and recovery time is important
in determining the intertidal position of C. digitalis (Branch
1981, Davies 1969). It appears that C. digitalis has developed
a unique recovery ability which not only dictates how high they
are found in the intertidal, but how low as well.
