samples were centrifuged to settle out particulates and the
osmolarity of the supernatant was determined with a Precisions
System Microsmometer that utilizes freezing point depression.
RES
Experiment 1:
Figure 1 depicts theweight loss of Group 4 following 5
days of repeated 20 hour exposures with 4 hour submergence
time. As expected, rate of weight loss is high during the
first few hours and then begins to level out with time (Wolcott
1973). Least square fit values reveal the slope (Rate of desicÂ¬
cation) for period 1 to equal .011f.0013 (group 4 alone) /
.0093f.001 (pooled) and the slope of period 5 to equal .Ollt.0019,
Rates of desiccation, thus, were not significantly different,
There is a significant difference between W/W(i) at time O for
each period: limpets at time O in period 5 weighed an average of
1.056:.026 x their original weight, W/W(i).
The pattern of weight loss for Group 4 is shown in Figure
2. Weight gain during their 4 hour submergence showed a gradual
increase over successive periods of exposure. Period 3 shows the
limpets gaining, on average, 1.017t.0075 x their initial weight.
Figure 3 shows that the 2 hour submergence group (Group 2)
also changed little in the rate of weight loss between periods
I and 5 (mj-.0084.0005 (group 2 alone)/.00932.001 (pooled),
m5-.0091.0012). Unlike the limpets in Group 4, these limpets
showed little fluctuations from their initial weights, W(i),
at the beginning of each period.
