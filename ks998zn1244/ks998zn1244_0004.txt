but its importance is cited by several authors (Branch 1981
Davies 1969). Results from this study reveal that there seems
to be an ideal recovery time for a given total weight loss and
that longer submergence time does not necessarily result in
better recovery. Perhaps the time it takes C. digitalis and
other limpets to recover is more important in determining loca¬
tion in the high intertidal than had previously been emphasized.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiment 1:
Forty limpets were collected at Still Water Cove, Monterey
County, California, and placed in separate plastic petri dishes
two days before experimenting began. During this time, all
limpets received, on average, three hours of submergence daily
to insure that none were stressed due to desiccation. The
limpets were separated into four groups of ten (Groups O. .5
2, and 4). All groups had limpets of similar sizes, ranging
from a mean radius of 9.8 mm. to 13.3 mm (Mean radius - limpet
length + width/2).
A period of exposure of 20 hours was selected to approximate
times of exposure normally found in the field when C. digitalis
is wet only by the high high tides. To simulate a desiccation
stress, experimental limpets were placed in air circulated by an
electrical fan and under lamps that maintained the temperature
at about 21°C. These conditions are not abnormal for the high
intertidal limpet and were not expected to cause any other harm
(i.e. heat stress) to the limpets.
