digitalis, at low tide, on dry vertical intertidal rocks tend to
orient with the head pointed downward and to the right (facing
toward 3 to 6 o'clock). When splashed by a rising tide they turn.
either right or left, and move about; no marked orientation
tendency appears. On receding tides activity decreases and limpets
again come to rest and tend to orient toward 3 to 6 o'clock.
Changes in orientation reflect changes in direction of movement.
Percent of animals moving, and average distance moved increase
with increasing duration of the period of wetting. The population
shows a net movement upward during higher high water periods, or
during storms, and downward during lower high water periods; this
tendency is more marked for high tides occurring in daylight than
at night. Some animals display homing behavior. ---Author.

At Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, Acmaea
digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833 is abundant on granite rocks
above the Endocladia-Balanus zone (see Glynn, 1965). Pre-
liminary observations showed that these limpets tend to
orient with their heads facing downward on vertical or
nearly vertical rocks during periods of low water. No pre¬
vious studies on orientation in Acmaea digitalis have been
found. However, in studies on ciliary currents of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lottia gigantea : Exact'>Lottia

in the distribution of populations over extended periods
of time (Frank, 1965).
In the present study an attempt was made to deter-
mine the orientation and movements of Acmaea digitalis
on vertical rocks at various stages of the tidal cycle.
and to gain some insight into the factors influencing
them.

FIELD STUDIES ON ORIENTATION
An initial field study was carried out to determine
the orientation tendency of Acmaea digitalis on vertical
surfaces at low tide. Acmaea digitalis were observed on
one large vertical rock, and the orientation of 136 lim¬
pets was recorded in terms of the position on a clock
toward which the head of each was pointing. Animals with
their anterior ends straight up were recorded as 12 o'clock,
those with heads straight down at 6 o'clock, etc. The re¬
sults, shown in Figure 1, reveal a clear tendency, at low
tide, to orient with the head downward from 4 to 7 o'clock.
Later observations on other populations, including those
in movement studies, confirm this tendency (Table 1).
Young <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea scabra : Exact'>Acmaea scabra</span> (Gould, 1846) on vertical surfaces
appear to show a similar tendency, though detailed obser-
vations are lacking.
Upon finding an orientation tendency at low tide, the
next step was an investigation of orientation during a
tidal cycle. All the following field observations on or¬
ientation were made on one vertical granite rock face (see
Table 4, rock 1). On this rock surface 152 <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea : Exact'>Acmaea</span> digital-

is were individually marked. The shell of each limpet was
painted with a patch of yellow paint upon which an ident-
ifying number was marked in India ink. Each limpet's or-
ientation was recorded approximately every 3 hours during
lower low water (LLW), lower high water (LHW), higher low
water (HLW), and the intervening mid-tides, on 3 successive
days. No reading was taken at higher high water (HHW) due
to heavy surf.
The results, shown in Table 1, clearly indicate that
changes in orientation take place during the tidal cycle.
The net change in orientation for each individual be-
tween successive observations was then computed, assuming
that rotation in each case was accomplished by turning the
minimum number of clock units necessary to account for the
change (Figure 2). During the first tidal cycle the pop-
ulation showed more rotation upward with a rising tide and
more rotation downward with a receding tide, but this was
not repeated in the next two tidal cycles.
The general activity of the population, as measured
by the sum of the up and down rotation, and by the per
cent of the population rotating (Figure 2), shows a peak
associated with each high tide. The decrease in the height
of these peaks of activity from one recorded high tide to
the next is associated with a slight decrease in the heights
of successive LHWs, and a resultant decrease in both the
number of animals being effectively wetted and the dura¬
tion of the period of splash. Also, during the first re-
corded LHW a fog bank blocked the sunlight, while on later
29

LHWs direct sunlight dried the rock surface sooner. The
results shown in Figure 2 suggest that activity of the
THE
population is proportional tofdegree of wetting of the
limpet population and the rock surface at high tide.
Since at some LHWs the whole population was effect¬
ively wetted and at others only the lower limpets re¬
ceived significant splash, for subsequent high tide stud-
ies the population on the rock face was divided into
groups; a high group ranging from about 14 to 18 feet
above mean LLW, and a low group located 9 to 12 feet above
mean LLW. Hourly observations were made during a HHW and
a LHW period. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure
3. The amount of rotation and the per cent of the popu-
lation rotating is clearly related to the amount of splash
received. The graphs in Figure 3 perhaps explain the dif¬
ferences in rotational activity shown by the limpets during
the three successive tidal cycles portrayed in Figure 2.
In Figure 3, in the low group of limpets at the high tide
at 2000 hours, about 30 animals were rotating; as a group
they rotated a minimum of 105 clock units. Similar high
amounts of rotation occurred all during the splash period.
These results, combined with the results on direction of
rotation presented in Figure 2, show that orientation and
direction of rotation tend to be random during the time the
rock is thoroughly wetted. This tendency toward random or-
ientation was also apparent from watching the limpet move-
ments during periods of splash.
For the limpet population to shift from a primarily
T
Alan C. Miller
head downward orientation at low tide to a more random,
orientation on the rocks during high tide requires that
some limpets rotate upward. To check whether there was a
tendency for them to turn upward toward the right (counter-
clockwise) or upward toward the left (clockwise), the
data from Table 2 were used as follows. The limpet popu-
lation was divided into left-oriented animals (limpets
facing clock directions 7 to 11) and right-oriented an-
imals (limpets facing clock directions 1 to 5). The limp-
ets facing 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock were divided equally
between right and left facing groups. The mean direction
of orientation and standard deviation were calculated for
both left and right facing groups for each period of ob-
servation shown in Table 2. The results are given in Table
3. Some tendency to turn upward at the beginning of the
observation period and downward toward the end is indi-
cated, but there is no clearcut preference for either a
clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. Standard deviations
are largest and show most variation during periods when
the rock was splashed, reflecting the rather random or-
ientation of the high and low Acmaea digitalis populations
during the two tidal cycles. Rotational movement was great-
est during HHW, and greatest for the low group of limpets
which received the most splash. As the water level dropped
and splash declined, activity of the population decreased
and the per cent of limpets with heads oriented downward
and toward the right, in the directions of 4 to 6 o'clock.
increased.

While it is established that on vertical rock surf-
aces Acmaea digitalis populations tend to orient with
heads directed downward and to the right during periods
of low tide, neither the selective advantages nor
the causes of this behavior are er
irely clear. The
limpet Lot
gantea orients much as does A. dig:
talis
at low tide, and Abbott (1956) has suggested that with the
head down, water run-off coming down the rock from waye
splash would help clean the nuchal cavity of waste ma-
terials. He also points out that water trapped in the
mantle groove as the tide recedes would drain toward the
anterior end, thus keeping the head and ctenidium wet
while the limpet is exposed at low tide. Abbott also
suggests that an orientation with the head down and to
the right might be slightly more advantageous than with
the head down and to the left, since in the former case
water running down the rock would tend to reinforce the
existing ciliary currents in the nuchal cavity.
In Acmaea, as in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lottia : Exact'>Lottia,</span> the anal opening lies on
the right side of the nuchal cavity, so waterrun-offon
the rock could easily help remove the waste materials
from a limpet orientated toward 3 to 5 o'clock. Orien-
tation toward 7 to 11 o'clock may present more of a
problem since the feces would have to travel a greater
distance through the mantle cavity to get out. However.
29
Alan C. Miller
according to Yonge (1962), and my personal observations,
the ctenidium is flexible enough to be moved from one side
of the mantle cavity to the other, carrying with it fecal
material. This could transfer the fecal material to the
opposite side where it could be washed out if the limpet
were oriented to the left on the rock face. With reference
to Abbott's suggestion about retaining water around the
anterior parts at low tide, it was noticed that when the
first splash covered A. digitalis facing downward on a
dry, vertical surface, most animals raised their shells
posteriorly and extended the mantle for less than a minute,
permitting water running down the rock to flow under the
shell toward the head. This activity occurred on successive
splashes and slowly decreased; then the limpet usually
moved. Animals facing upward on the rock sometimes raised
the fronts of their shells at the first signs of water
run-off, permitting water to run about the head.
Almost nothing is known of the factors acting as
immediate causes of particular responses and behavior
patterns in <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Acmaea : PartialExact'>Acmaea
gitalis.</span> Although limpets clamp
down more tightly on rock surfaces in reaction to light
rom a flashlight at night and to a shadow cast in the
day, the present studies, showing that downward orien-
tation can occur at night as well as during the day,
suggest light is not a primary factor here. Laboratory
experiments involving geotropism have not been carried
out. Hewatt (1940), in tests with Acmaea scabra, found
that geotropism did not seem to be a factor in homing
29
Alan C. Miller
ability. There is certainly a good correlation between an
increasing exposure to splash and an increase in activity,
the latter resulting in a more random orientation on the
rocks. Likewise, the decline of splash during a receding
tide is correlated with increasing downward orientation.

FIELD STUDIES ON MOVEMENT
Observations made during the orientation studies
suggested that changes in orientation during the period
of wetting might be associated mainly with vertical
movements. To determine whether this was the case, 25
Acmaea digitalis on vertical granite rocks were watched
during night high tides and 25 during day high tides.
Rocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used in these observations
(see Table 4). A spot of paint was placed on the rock
surface in front of each limpet's head and also on the
peak of its shell; both spots of paint were marked with
matching numbers in India ink. During the watches the
vertical and horizontal distancesbetween the anterior
portion of each limpet and its spot of paint on the rock
were recorded every ten minutes.
Two of the fifty individual movement paths are shown
in Figure 5. The movement paths showed that moving animals
were almost always oriented with the anterior end of the
shell pointed in the direction of movement, but a change
in orientation sometimes occurred with relatively little
forward movement (Figure 6). Data on movement and rotation
29
F1G

of limpets, collected on nine different watches, are
presented in Figures 7 and 8; data are grouped for each
thirty minute interval for each watch.
The complex relationships between the various var¬
iables shown in Figures 7 and 8 are best considered in
relation to specific questions. These are considered be¬
low, and pertinent data are summarized in Figures 9 th
ough 14.
First, is there a direct relationship between amount
of movement and amount of rotation? A scatter diagram
(Figure 9) of the data presented in Figures 7 and 8 in¬
dicates that there is a general relationship, but the cor¬
relation between movement and rotation is not a strong one.
Second, is there initial movement upward (i.e., move¬
ment in the direction of 10, 11, 12, 1, or 2 o'clock with¬
in the first 30 minutes of motion) by the limpet population
in either day or night? Such an upward movement might help
explain a tendency to rotate upward as movement commences
on a rising tide. In order to supplement the data from
Figures 7 and 8, another similar watch -thogePen

andeed was undertaken on rock 3
(Table 4), except the movements of the population were
recorded for only the first hour of the wetting period
during a LHW and the following HHW. The data from these ob-
servations, presented in Figure 10, show that 50% or more
of the limpets do show an initial upward movement. No sig-
nificant difference between day and night is demonstrated.

Third, is there a final movement downward, corres¬
ponding with the tendency to orient head down at low tide?
The final individual movements and orientations for the 50
limpets depicted in Figures 7 and 8 are presented in Fig¬
ure 11. Most limpets do exhibit a final movement downward
associated with a final head down orientation. Of those
whose final movement was upward, some only changed direc¬
tion from, say, 6 to 4 o'clock. While this is an upward
movement, the final orientation is still down, explaining
why fewer limpets had a terminal head up orientation than
exhibited final movement upward.
Fourth, does the percent of limpets which moved
during a given high tide increase with increasing dura-
tion of the period of wetting? Data from the 9 watches in
Figures 7 and 8 are plotted in Figure 12; they show that
the per cent of animals moving does tend to increase as
the period of wetting gets longer. The longer wetting
periods occurred at night, so one can't adequately compare
the results obtained during night and day.
Fifth, are there relationships between the amount of
time spent moving, the distance moved, the duration of
wetting, and the time of day? Data for individual limpet
movements appear in Figure 13. The results show that the
distances moved and time spent moving tend to increase
as the wetting periods get longer. Distance moved is
roughly proportional to time spent moving. The animals
were generally wetted for longer periods at night, so
it is difficult to contrast the day and night results.

Six, do limpets tend to move more rapidly, on the
average, during high tides at night than during high
tides in daylight hours? The average rates of movement
for all of the individual limpets used to obtain data
for Figures 7 and 8 are summarized in Figure 14. The
average rates for day and night differ by only 0.1 mm/min.
In a "t test" applied to these results, t=1.31 with a
probability of .10-.20 that the null hypothesis that
there is no difference between day and night rate of loco¬
motion should be rejected. Therefore, the difference is
not statistically significant. The higest rate encountered
TIME
at anyAin these studiés occurred during an uncompleted day¬
time watch when one limpet moved 13 mm/min during a 5 minute
period. However, raves of locomotion well above average
(i.e., 5-8mm/min) for short poriods on the part of individual
limpets were more commonly observed at night than during the
day.
It was noticed in some watches that a majority of the
population of limpets moving showed a net vertical displace¬

ment either upward or downward..
Two hypotheses which might
account for this behavior were proposed: (1) local limpet
populations may show a net upward displacement during HHW,
and a net downward displacement during LHW; (2) the net dis¬
placement of the population upward or downward during a high
tide may differ according to whether it occurs during the day
or night. Sixty A. digitalis on vertical rocks 1,6,7,8,9, and
10 were individually marked and their positions recorded before

and after each period of high water for several successive
days. The per cent known to have moved to a new position
(homing limpets and non-moving limpets had the same posit¬
ions) and the per cent showing a net upward displacement
at each LHW and HHW period are recorded in Figures 15 and
16. The results clearly show that the per cent of limpets
moving and showing an upward displacement consistently
increases during HHW and decreases during LHW. Two factors
which might be responsible for this behavior, duration of
the period of wetting and time of the high tide, are con-
sidered below.
Is there a correlation between duration of the per-
iod of wetting and the net upward (or downward) displace¬
ment of the population at high tide? Actual duration of
II
splash was not measured, but the periods of HHW and LHW
were arranged in order of decreasing height of the tide
(as actually measured on the tide guage operated by the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, about one mile from the
observation site). The per cent of the population showing
net vertical displacement upward and downward (Figure 17,
top), and the amount of vertical displacement upward and
downward (Figure 17, bottom) were calculated for each high
tide. While the method used to establish relative duration
of wetting periods did not take into account variations due
to differences in turbulence, the results show that, in
general, the higher the height of high water, the larger
the per cent of the population exhibiting a net upward dis¬
300

placement. The amount of vertical displacement upward also
tends to be greater during the longer periods of wetting and
lower during the more brief wetting periods. The tendency of
the population to respond as it does, moving up or down
depending on the height of the tide, appears to provide a
mechanism by which the population is maintained at a favor-
able level on the rocks.
Conspicuous upward vertical displacements may occur
during periods of unusually heavy surf. One such instance
occurred on rock 9 (see Table 4) between LHW on Sept. 18 and
71
LHW on Sept. 19; during a storm, 9 of 10 limpets observed
moved up on the rock an average distance of 33cm (range -
4-78cm). These observations are similar to those of Frank
(1965) who found that a population of Acmaea digitalis on
the Oregon coast moved higher on the rocks during the winter
an action apparently related to heavy surf caused by winter
storms. However, in the present case the marked upward move-
ment was observed to occur in less than 24 hours.
Is there any difference in vertical displacement
tendencies during high tides at night as opposed to those
during theday? Pertinent data from the population shown in
Figures 15 and 16 have been summarized in Figure 18. The
tendency to move upward during HHW and downward at LHW is
much more marked when the high water occurs during the day.
The differences in behavior at LHW and HHW would probably
have been more marked had it not been for two circumstances.
First, rough surf occurred during the last two watches in
Figure 16, for both HHW and LHW, causing
30
Alan C. Miller
14
longer than usual periods of wetting and also causing the
population to move upward on the rock. Second, the height of
LHW in the last watch was about 5 feet, and that of HHW only
about 6 feet, so the poriods of wetting were of nearly the
same duration for both high tides. It was only during LHW
periods with a maximum height of 4.4 to 3.0 feet (Figure
17) that tendency toward a downward displacement with little
upward displacement became marked.
Approximately 25% of the limpets observed in the course
of the present study showed a tendency to home, i.e., re-
turn to a specific position and orientation on the rock.
Galbraith (1965) reported finding homing in A. digitalis
on relatively smooth rocks bearing ridges and numerous
small depressions. Millard (1966) likewise found some A.
digitalis homing on granite rocks at Pacific Grove.
Villee and Groody (1940) also noted this tendency but
preferred not to call it homing behavior. Frank (1965),
in Oregon, reported no evidences of homing.

SUMMARY
1. At low tide Acmaea digitalis on dry vertical rock sur-
faces remain in place and tend to orient with the head
pointed downward and to the right (facing toward 3 to
6 o'clock).
2. When wetted by a rising tide, many limpets start to move;
they tend to turn upward, either to the right or lef
orientation of the population becomes more random as
movements increase,Movement either up or down on the
rock face may occur.
3. On a receding tide, as splash lessens, limpets on vert¬
ical surfaces show decreased activity and again tend to
orient facing downward and to the right.
4. In general, the longer the period of wetting at high
water, the larger the percentage of the population
which moves, the longer the period of movement, the
greater the amount of body rotation, and the greater
the distance moved by the population.
5. The limpet population tends to move upward on the rocks
at periods of higher high water, and downward at periods
of lower high water. The tendency is more marked for
high water periods occurring during daylight hours.
With rough surf, the limpet population as a whole
moves upward on vertical rock faces, and comes back
down during ensuing periods of calm weather.
6. Approximately 25% of the A. digitalis observed showed
homing behavior.

those obtained at night are shown in Figure 8. Height
of the population boxes (N) shows the total number of
limpets watched in each tidal period; the darkened
area in each box shows a cumulative total of the num-
ber of these limpets which have moved at all at each
successive per
iod during the watch. The triangular
tidal diagrams show only the time and height of the
tidal peak and the points of initial and final splash.
For each tide all limpets were at approximately the
same level, and were subjected to the same conditions
of splash.

(bottom), in relation to height of tide. Figure 18
shows per cent of population moving up or down
(top), and total net displacement up or down (bottom),
in relation to time of day for all LHW and HHW
