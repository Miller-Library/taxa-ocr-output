Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
3. A. iricolor and A. semimaculata are apparently carnivorous
scavengers. Fecal pellet contents revealed 65% digested animal m
material and 15% sulphur bacteria.
4. L. zonata and L. erecta are herbivore, ingesting predomin-
antly red algae in "bites" as revealed by fecal pellet analyses.
5. Both Arabella species live in individual systems of semi-
permanent mucus burrows next to the site of attachment of the PhylloÂ¬
chaetopterus tubes and clusters of tunicates. The worms do not share
burrows, and do show aggressive territoriality.
6. The Lumbrineris species live in a system of semippermanent
mucus burrows in the sand under Phyllospadix roots. Evidence from
behavioral studies indicated that the worms are probably browsers.
No aggressive behavior was seen.
