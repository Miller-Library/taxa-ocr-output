Feeding and behavior of polychaetes

pendent of the burrows of other arabellids. This correlates well with
their territorial behavior.
Within sand filled aquaria each L. zonata constructed an inter-
connected system of burrows throughout the sand. Most sets of burrows
had at least one opening to the surface. These worms often used pre¬
existing burrows, and in so doing frequently encountered one another.
No aggression between lumbrinerids was ever noticed. The worms either
turned around, backed up or burrowed in another direction. In con¬
trast, two L. erecta placed in the same sand filled aquarium establish-
ed U-shaped burrows with both ends open to the surface. During the
observed two week period, both L. erecta spent about 95% of the
time in the top one third of the sandy layer. Occasionally each worm
nosed around on the surface or burrowed some distance, but generally
both remained in or returned to the site of the original burrow.
Reproduction and Regeneration
Spawning behavior was seen once in L. erecta. Eggs were visible
through the the body wall. They appeared to be shed through the body
wall. They appeared to be shed through ducts between the pre-and post¬
setal lobes of the parapodia. The eggs, when shed, were loose, not
contained in gelatinous masses.
Up to 70% of arabellids collected whole showed evidence of pos¬
terior regeneration; a lighter pigment in the posterior 30-40 setigers.
Noting this, a small-scale regeneration experiment was started using
A. iricolor. Six whole worms were selected. From four the anterior
40 setigers were excised, from the remainder the last 40 setigers
were removed. After one week all the posterior ends had died. At
the end of four weeks a presumed pygidial bud had formed on one worm.
