Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
lumbrinerids present varied inversely with the number of Cirriformia
spirabrancha.
The rare occurrence of A. iricolor, A. semimaculata and L. erecta
intertidally suggests that the bulk of the populations are subtidal.
At the wharf Donat (1975) found A. iricolor and L. erecta subtidally
to -1.5 meters. He did not find any A. semimaculata.
FOOD HABIT
The second part of this study involved investigating the dietary
differences between the four species by analzing fecal pellet contents.
To do this, freshly collected specimens were brought to the lab,
cleaned, and separated by species and collection sites. Groups were
placed in finger bowls of fresh sea at 12-14°0. and, after varying
time intervals, fecal pellets were collected from each bowl and mounted
in glycerine. Examination under a compound microscope (and consulta¬
tion with faculty members) permitted identification of the contents.
Approximations to within 10% were made for the percentage content of
each constituent in each fecal pellet. These results were then used
to calculate the mean percent content of each constituent for each
species. Complete results are found in Figures 3 and 4 and Tables 2
and 3.
Both species of Arabella show lipid, well digested animal material,
and sulphur bacteria in their feces. The percentage of sulphur bacteria
was significantly different between the species in the marina collec-
tion, though sample size was small. However, the sulphur bacterial
content for A. iricolor from both habitats was not significantly dif-
ferent. Percentage detritus was at a consistent minimum with small
variance. Both species had no animal hard parts in their feces.
