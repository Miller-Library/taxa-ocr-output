Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
of worms in glass bowls filled with sea water; other observations
were made of worms in narrow, glass sided aquaria.
Distinct locomotory behaviors were observed and seemed to be the
simple subunits of more complex behaviors which included feeding,
territoriality and search behavior. The different behaviors noted are
defined and discussed in the following paragraphs. Separate sections
on lumbrinerids and arabellids are included only where striking dif-
ferences were noted.
Locomotor activity of any sort in arabellids and lumbrinerids is
accompanied by the secretion of mucus from the anterior end of the
animal, presumably the prostomium. The mucus is pulled back poster-
iorly by parapodial movement as the worm moves, coating the entire
body. The rate of secretion and movement of mucus varies with worm
activity. Permanent or semi-permanent burrows are constructed when the
mucus adheres to the substratum, usually either sand or silt, main-
taining and open passageway.
All locomotory behaviors subsequently described involve setal
movements, therefore mention of setal types and their use is here
made. Both lumbrinerids and arabellids have limbate setae. They
appear throughout the length of the body in arabellids, but in lum-
brinerids they occur only anteriorly, with hooded hooks appearing
posteriorly. Limbate setae are well adapted for a mucus tube existence.
They hold the tube sides firmly, and also perform well in locomotion
outside of the tube. The hooded hooks of the lumbrinerids are ex¬
tended perpendicularly when the animal is alarmed, holding it tightly.
in its tube. Arabellids show a similar response in alarm, both in
and out of the tube. The body contracts and coils to hold its posi¬
tion within the tube.
