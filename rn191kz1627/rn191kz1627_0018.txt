Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
For L. zonata the contents of fecal pellets varied widely, both
between collection groups and among worms of the same collection group.
Even consecutive pellets from a single worm showed high variability.
But in all cases the fecal content was primarily plant material, the
majority consisting of red algae. It is interesting to note that
Hildenbrandia and Peyssonellia were found in the pellet contents.
These are encrusting algae which the worm had to scrape off the sub-
strate to ingest. Cross-sections of algae in the pellets suggested
that plant material had been bitten or scraped off, rather than taken
in as detritus.
Arabellids are generally considered to be carnivorous (Pettibone,
1963; Day, 1967). The well digested animal material, the presence of
sulphur bacteria, (very common on decaying animal material in the sea,)
and the lack of hard parts in the feces further suggest the worms are
carnivorous scavengers. Arabellids were never seen to eat carrion in
the lab, however. The consistently low percentage of detritus in the
gut indicates a high degree of selectivity towards preferred animal
foods.
L. zonata is unquestionably herbivorous, in complete contrast to
earlier literature which names all Lumbrineris species as carnivores
(Pettibone, 1963; Day, 1967). Although the worms live among Phyllo-
spadix roots, where a wide variety of both animal and plant matter is
available to eat, they appear to be feeding selectively on red algae.

E BEHAVIOR
During our various investigations, several types of behavior were
noted. Some observations were made, under a dissecting microscope,
