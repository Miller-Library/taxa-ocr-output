Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
Feeding and proboscis eversion.
Polychaetes of both
families have well developed, hard jaw parts used in feeding.
(Figure 5.) Proboscis eversion and subsequent behavior was observed
on several occasions in the laboratory. In proboscis eversion, the
prostomium is raised, the circular muscles of the first two segments
are relaxed, and the circular muscles in segments 3, 4 and 5 conÂ¬
tract, forcing the pharynx out. As the pharynx protrudes, the jaw
parts spread out laterally, until, at full extension, the jaws are
fully open. This eversion is accompanied with a slight backward
movement. Next comes a forward lunge, closure of the jaws, and in-
version of the proboscis. The worm retracts quickly, tearing off a
piece of whatever it has bitten. This general action, used in feed-
ing in both families, and in territorial behavior in arabellids, was
seen on six occasions.
The basic action may be modified in two ways. In one method,
seen once in A. iricolor,tthe jaws were fully everted and the worm
was seen to scrape them along Phyllochaetopterus tubes. In the other
method, seen twice in both A iricolor and lumbrinerids, the pro-
stomium was partially everted, exposing the forceps (maxillae 7)
and several of the other plates. The forceps opened laterally, g
grabbing and ripping off pieces of food material.
Attempts were made to elicit feeding responses in both lumbri-
nerids and arabellids using potential foods, both whole and ground.
No feeding responses were seen. Mangum and Cox (1971) noted a feed-
ing response elicited by homogenates of possible food items. A
similar method was attempted with tubiculous arabellids, but no
discernible feeding response was seen.
