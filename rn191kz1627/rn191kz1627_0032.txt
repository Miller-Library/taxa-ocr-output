Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
a similar, though more extensive tube system beneath the Phyllo-
spadix roots. The animals are unquestionably herbivores, which ap-
pear to ingest their food in sizeable "bites." At least occasionÂ¬
ally they scrape encrusting algae such as Hildenbrandia and Peysso-
nellia from the rocks. This information, derived from fecal pellet
analysis, in conjunction with one observation of feeding and a
knowledge of jaw parts, leads one to conclude that the worms are
browsers, emerging from their tubes to take in living plant material
and detritus from the immediate vicinity.
A comparison of the distribution, feeding and observed behavior
of the four species studied reveals striking differences in many
respects. With regard to habitat, both arabellids were mainly found
in a subtidal environment, in protected burrows in calm water. Both
lumbrinerids were found intertidally, L. zonata being much more
abundant than L. erecta. Possibly L. erecta is primarily subtidal.
As striking a difference was seen in feeding. Arabellids are
carnivorous scavengers and defend their home grounds. Lumbrinerids
are browsing herbivores and do not defend territories.
SUMMARY
1. Arabella iricolor and Arabella semimaculata were found in
moderate numbers in Phyllochaetopterus tube communities at wharf
72 and the Monterey marina and in tunicate clusters at the marina.
Infrequently an A. iricolor was found in Phyllospadix roots at
Mussel Point. in the low intertidal zone (O to -2 ft.).
2. Lumbrineris zonata was found abundantly intertidally (O to
-2 ft.) at Mussel Point. L. erecta was found more rarely in the same
habitat. Neither species was found at the wharf or marina.
