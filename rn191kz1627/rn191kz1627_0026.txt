Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
Many lumbrinerids collected had small regenerated pygidia and
posterior segments.
24 Hour Behavioral Observation
To better observe the behavior and general "living habits" of
the arabellids and lumbrinerids, narrow glass sided aquaria were
set up to simulate their respective natural habitats while allow-
ing us to see them. For the arabellids, three aquaria, 35 cm.x
30 cm. x 2 cm. were loosely filled with Phyllochaetopterus prolifica
tubes and the related small organisms obtained from the collection
site at the marina. A similar aquarium, only.4 cm. thick, was
filled with fine sand for the lumbrinerids. All aquaria were main-
tained with fresh running sea water at 12-13° C. and kept under a
dark cover to minimize behavior related to light sensitivity.
Systematic observations, which would be statistically treatable,
were made over a 24 hour time period. It was hoped that these ex-
tended observations would allow observations of low frequency behav¬
ior, activity as related to time of day, correlations between behav-
ior and possibly periodicity. A check sheet was devised to record
location, orientation and behavior for each worm at five minute
intervals. (Table 4.)
The gathered data were initially averaged to note the amount of
time each worm spent engaged in each activity. Hourly averages of
activities were also plotted over time to detect any trends in act¬
ivity as correlated to time of day or periodicity. No plots of this
sort yielded any meaningful correlations so time periods were grouped
in four hour blocks. In this analysis the midday shift for both
Arabella species was shown to be significantly more active than
