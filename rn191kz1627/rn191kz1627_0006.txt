Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
Collections were carried out in three different habitats: the
rocky shores near Hopkins Marine Station at Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove; the marina at Monterey Harbor; and commercial wharf 2 at
Monterey, California. Phyllospadix roots were collected by hand
from the sandy channel on the east shore of Mussel Point at low tide.
Phyllochaetopterus tubes and clusters of tunicates were gathered from
wharf pilings and from floats at the marina by hand or using skin or
SCUBA diving. Worms were separated from the substratum in the field.
They were stored in the laboratory in running sea water at 12-13° c.
Results of the study are summarized in Table 1.
Arabellids were found almost exclusively at the wharf and marina,
subtidally. A few A. iricolor but no A. semimaculata were found in
Phyllospadix roots. Arabellids in Phyllochaetopterus tubes and tuni-
cate clusters usually were situated at the site of attachment.
Lumbrinerids were found only intertidally in Phyllospadix roots.
No lumbrinerids were found at the marina or wharf. L. zonata popula-
tions vary greatly from place to place within the low intertidal zone
(O to -2 ft.). The worms were found only in sand or coarse shell frag¬
ments in and under Phyllospadix roots, not in plain sand in beaches or
in any algal holdfasts.
It has been reported by Donat (1975) that both lumbrinerids and
arabellids occur in Phyllochaetopterus tube communities at the wharf.
Our collections were not substantial enough to comment about this
finding.
Although populations of other organisms present at the collecting
sites were not counted, it is our impression that under Phyllospadix
roots where the available space may be limiting, the number of
