Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker 20
Locomotory Behavion
1. Burrowing in all species studied involves forward peri-
staltic movement of the anterior portion of the body, directed by
the prostomium. The parapodia in the mid and posterior portions are
extended monotaxisally and provide anchorage.
2. Reverse peristalsis is a rapid reversal of the burrowing
movement. It is often seen when a worm receives an aversive stim¬
ulus anteriorly.
3. Crawling is a ditaxic "walking" motion. It is used in
preburrowed tubes or on the surface of a substratum.
4. Backing up is essentially crawling in reverse.
5. Turning around involves bending the body double and crawl-
ing with the parapodia making a "U" turn within a mucus burrow.
6. Nosing around is an exploratory movement performed by
worms especially when they protrude the anterior end out of the burrow.
A worm iifts its prostomium and first few segments off the substratum
and moves this portion slowly side to side in a "searching" manner.
7. Ventilation (?) or side-to-side movement is a lateral
undulation of the body within a burrow. It appears to be accomp¬
lished by forcefully extending the setae and parapodia out laterally
on one side while retracting them on the opposite side. The action
occurs in waves traveling along the body so that if at any instant
the worm was frozen it would look like a sine wave.
Defecation
Feces are eliminated in discrete pellets.
Defecation was rarely observed under natural conditions. However,
L. zonata in its burrow was once seen to back up till the anus was
at the burrow entrance and to defecate outside of the burrow.
