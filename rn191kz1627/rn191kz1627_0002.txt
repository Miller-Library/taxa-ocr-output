Feeding and behavior of polychaetes
P. Mark, E. Whitaker
and they form the subjects of the present study.
Arabella iricolor (Montagu, 1904) is cosmopolitan, occurring in
rocky habitats and sediments. It is thought to be a predator (Hartman,
1944; Pettibone, 1963; Day, 1967). Pettibone (1957) states that juve-
niles have been found parasitic in the body cavity of Diopatra ornata.
A. semimaculata (Moore, 1911) occurs from W. Mexico north to W.
Canada and is also thought to be predatory. (Figure 1.)
Lumbrineris zonata (Johnson, 1900) and L. erecta (Moore, 1904)
are burrowers in sandy sediments (Hartman, 1944). Members of the
genus Lumbrineris are considered to be carnivorous, although it is
not known whether they are predators or scavengers (Pettibone, 1963;
Day, 1967). (Figure 2.)
Hartman (1944, 1968), Dales (1962), Pettibone (1963), Day (1967),
Richards (1967) and Fauchald (1970) have looked at taxonomy, distriÂ¬
bution and selected aspects of behavior in representatives of the two
families. Yet beyond casual observation and conjecture, very little
is known of the similarities or differences in the Arabellidae and
Lumbrineridae beyond anatomical details. We studied distribution,
feeding and selected behavior of A. iricolor, A. semimaculata, L.
zonata and L. erecta in the interest of making comparisons in some
aspects of their natural histories. All studies were carried out
at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove,
California, in April and May, 1976.
DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIE
The first step in the comparison was to investigate a variety
of habitats and note the occurrence and distribution of each species.
