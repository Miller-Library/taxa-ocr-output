Territorial Behavior
On several occasions throughout the study arabellids were obser-
ved displaying territorial behavior in protecting the home areas right
around their burrows. To facilitate study and elicit more aggressive
displays, both species of arabellids were introduced into glass capil-
lary tubes where they established themselves for several days. Any
attempt to manipulate the worms or tubes to optimize aggression were
not successful.
A general behavioral sequence based on five occurrences is postu¬
lated for territoriality. Three of five times a free living worm
wandered to within four to five cms. of an established tubiculous
arabellid. Continued movement of the invader and the home worm
brought both worms to within about one cm. of each other. At about
this distance theyworms seemed to sense one another and withdrew a
short distance. Then, only the home worm everted its jaws and made
a well aimed lunge at the other worm. After the lunge, which may or
may not culminate in an effective bite (one of five times the attack
caused a tear in the body wall of the trespassing worm,) both worms
withdrew, after which the invader left.
Tubiculous behavior
Overall observations were made on the tubiculous living habits
of all species.
Each arabellid placed in narrow aquariumcontaining a cluster of
Phyllochaetopterus tubes established a semi-permanent system of mucus
burrows with multiple openings to which it returned after foraging.
Worms in the same aquarium never shared burrows. Indeed, all ara¬
bellid burrow systems seemed to be completely autonomous and inde¬
