Feeding and behavior of polychaetes

The polychaete families Arabellidae and Lumbrineridae are very
similar externally. Both lack prostomial appendages and have verm-
iform body shapes. The two families are assigned to the super-family
Eunicida on the basis of similarities in jaw anatomy and nephridia
(Hartman, 1944; Dales, 1962). Both Hartman (1944) and Dales (1962)
have hypothesized that some of the superficial similarities of these
families could be due to evolutionary convergence. However, Day
(1967) further emphasizes their basic relationship by making them
sub-families of the family Eunicidae. He makes this assignment based
on jaw characters and the presence and number of prostomial appendages,
branchiae and dorsal cirri.
Similarities between the groups at the family level are obvious,
but there are also differences, especially in setal types, in jaw
structure, and in the presence or absence of eyes. Arabellids often
have eyes, and they have limbate setae throughout. They are reported
as essentially burrowing, predaceous and carnivorous, but some species
have been found to be endoparasitic in other worms during their juve-
nile stages (Pettibone, 1963; Day, 1967). Lumbrinerids have hooded
hooks in posterior body segments and usually lack eyes. They are
considered to be chiefly carnivorous and burrowing (Pettibone, 1963;
Day, 1967).
According to Hartman (1968) there are 12 species of Arabellidae
(four in the genus Arabella) and 20 species of Lumbrineridae (eighteen
in the genus Lumbrineris) in Californian waters. The species Arabella
iricolor, A. semimaculata, Lumbrineris zonata and L. erecta (Figures
and 2) proved to be readily available in Monterey Bay, California,
