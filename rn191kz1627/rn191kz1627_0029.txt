DISCUSSION
Several features of A. iricolor and A. semimaculata discovered
in the course of this investigation contribute to a picture of the
life of these worms.
Arabella iricolor and A. semimaculata are tubiculous worms that
live in large numbers in wharf piling and harbor float communities.
The tubes are made by peristaltic burrowing and consolidated with
mucus. Arabellids have limbate setae adapted for grasping a mucus
tube.
The worms forage for their food during the day, merely extend¬
ing their anterior ends or entirely leaving the burrow and returning
to the same burrow for the bulk of the day. Tube systems are auto¬
nomous and worms do not share burrows. In fact, territorial protec¬
tion of tube and foraging area have been observed.
In the daylight feeding expeditions the worms selectively eat
animal carrion. Differences in the diet of A. iricolor and A. semi¬
naculata are statistically significant and may be indicative of
parameters that separate two worms that live in the same habitat and
are by all indications very similar.
Based upon fecal pellet contents, behavioral observations in the
laboratory, and observations made on Phyllospadix root clusters when
the worms were collected, a living "pattern" for L. zonata can be
reconstructed. The system of burrows constructed in the sand aquar¬
iums supports the idea that in natural conditions the worms have
