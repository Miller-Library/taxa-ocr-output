Direct cell count was also used as a measure of the standing
crop of netplankton (» 20 microns) and to provide data for deter-
mining community composition. Preserved samples of 100 ml were
placed in Nessler tubes and allowed to settle for 24 hours.
Ninety ml were then drawn off with an aspirator, and a 2 ml
aliquot was counted under an inverted microscope using the tech-
nique of Untermöhl (Lund, et al, 1958). The technique proved
adequate ( +
5%) for those phytoplankton larger than 20 microns,
but the fractionated chlorophylla values indicate that a sig-
nificant amount of nannoplankton was overlooked in the direct
counts.
Results
The levels of primary production and standing crop along
the study transect for each cruise are presented in Figures 3-7.
During the entire study, the standing crop and productivity in-
creased from deep water to CalcOFI 1, and decreased inshore of
CalcOFI 1. In addition, the data on corresponding cell density
supported the difference in standing crop between the nearshore
stations. Figure 8 presents the numbers of cell per liter at
each station for each week of the study. Although some of the
differences in cell numbers between the Hopper and Nearshore
are small, the percent contribution to each sample by the nanno-
plankton has been underestimated by direct count. Addition of
the total nannoplankton fraction would make the cell count results
a more significant index of the total standing crop.
The general increase in productivity from week to week is
shown in Figure 9. This graph also illustrates the consistent
