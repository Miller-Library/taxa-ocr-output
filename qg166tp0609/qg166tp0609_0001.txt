Abst:
Phytoplankton productivity, standing crop, and community
composition were investigated along a 15 km transect in Monterey
Bay from deep water to the extreme nearshore (30m from beach)
during a five week study in April and May, 1972. Consistent
and significant decreases in productivity and standing crop were
observed at the extreme nearshore station as compared to a station
200m offshore. Community structure remained relatively stable
during the period of study. Several hypotheses are offered in
an attempt to explain the observed nearshore decrease.
