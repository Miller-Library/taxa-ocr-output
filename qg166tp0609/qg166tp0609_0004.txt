Nuclear Chicago scalar (model 161A) equipped with a model D47
gas flow chambor with a micromil window. Rates of carbon
fixetion were calculated after averaging duplicate light
bottle values. Mean coefficient of variation between duplicate
light bottles was 8.7+2.0 (95% confidence limits). The method
of 140 labeling has been shown to be a dependable tool for
determining relative rates of photosynthesis in marine phyto-
plankton (Doty and Oguri, 1958).
Samples for chlorophyll analysis were also drawn from the
water samples, and chlorophyll, and phaeopigment concentrations
were found using the flourometic method of Strickland and Parsons
(1968). Samples were fractionated into netplankton and nanno-
plankton size classes by passing one of two replicates through
a 20 micron net filter prior to filtration thorugh a Whatman
GF/C glass filter. The other replicate was filtered directly
through the GF/C filter. Two ml of a 1 MgCo3 solution was
used to coat the filters.
The flourometric technique gives a measure of chlorophyll,
present in any given water sample, and gives good comparative
standing crop estimates as long as the species compositon remains
relatively stable between stations. While standing crop values,
using chlorophyllg as an index, may give a mistaken impression
of the absolute standing crop (different phytoplankters may
contain varying amounts of chlorophyll per unit volume), they
are still a valuable index of standing crop between sampling
stations, particularly during a period which shows no major
changes in phytoplankton community composition.
