Methods
Measurements of primary productivity and standing crop
were made at four stations in Monterey Bay over a five week
period from April 20 to May 16, 1972. The positions of the four
stations are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The deep water station.
CalcOFI 3, is located over the Monterey Submarine Canyon in
about 900 meters of water; CalcOFI 1, the bell buoy adjacent to
Hopkins Marine Station, is in about 40 meters of water; and the
two nearshore stations are located in the lee of Cabrillo Point.
one at the fish hopper, about 200 meters off the beach, and the
other in the area between the rocks flanking the Agassiz back
beach cove of the Marine Station, about 30 meters offshore.
The water depths at the Hopper and Nearshore are 20 meters and
10 meters, respectively.
Water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles from
a skiff at the two nearshore stations from  meter depths.
Samples at CalcOFI 1 and CalcOFI 3 were collected from 0, 5.
15, and 30 meter depths in Van Dorn bottles (Van Dorn, 1956)
during weekly cruises. All samples were collected prior to
1000 PST. Two light bottles and one dark bottle were drawn
from each sample, inoculated with Naplco3, and incubated under
flourescent light (about 0.06 langley/min) for 3 hours at sea-
surface temperature (Doty and Oguri, 1958). Following incuba-
tion, the bottles were filtered through .45 micron Millapore
HA filters. The filters were then rinsed with about 15 ml of
filtered sea water, dried in a dessicator, then counted on a
