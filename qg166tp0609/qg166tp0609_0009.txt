Lewin and Chen (1971) also indicates that inshore diatoms are
not as efficient in utilizing available iron. If the benthic
algae are either using or concentrating minor nutrients, the
inshore populations of diatoms could be suffering a nutrient
deficiency and not turning over as fast as under normal nutrient
conditions.
It can also be speculated that bacterial activity could
increase as a phytoplankton population moves to shallower water.
The presence of benthic algae, increasing waste products from
intertidal and bentic animals, and increasing amounts of detritus
could all lead to a larger bacterial population in the nearshore
waters. How these bacteria might affect the photosynthetic
efficiency or the productivity of a cell is open to speculation.
The most attractive hypothesis to explain decreased prod-
uctivity and standing crop nearshore is that of photodegradation
of chlorophyll. The growth inhibition of diatoms in response to
high light conditions has been noted by Epel and Krauss (1966).
The role of chlorophyllase in chlorophyll degradation is a
source of controversy at present (Yentsch and Moreth, 1970.
Barrett and Jefferies, 1971), but there is the possibility that
the bleaching of cells due to higher mean light levels in
shallow water activates the membrane-bound chlorophyllas to
degrade the chlorophyll to phaeophytin within the living cell.
Conversely, under certain conditions photodegradation could
be minimized in a community which had moved inshore as the top
10 meters of a highly stratified water column. The ability of
a high-density population to shade itself and thereby lower the
