drop in productivity between the Hopper and Nearshore, and in
some cases, between CalcOFI 1 and the Hopper.
Pulses within an upwelling period are often observed, and
the standing crop data shown in Figure 10 illustrates the dif-
ferent responses of the inshore stations to a strong upwelling
pulse on May 9. Nearshore is located inshore of a large Macro-
stis bed, while Hopper is located slightly offshore of the
same bed. The presence of the kelp bed may help create differ-
ent inshore environments for phytoplankton within short distances.
The differences in density of cells between the Hopper and
Nearshore can also be illustrated by calculation of the biomass
at each station as shown in Figure 11. These biomass figures
revresent averages of fractionated chlorophyll, data for the
whole study multiplied by a conversion factor to determine
biomass (Strickland and Parsons, 1968).
The vertical distribution of the standing crop refiects the
changing conditions which can occur within a period of general up-
welling and nutrient rich waters. This is presented graphically
in Figures 12-16.
The analysis of the phytoplankton community composition is pre-
sented in Tables 1-3. The composition of the community at any one
station changed only slightly during the five week study, and none
of the observed differences indicated a major shift in the types of
phytoplankters present. In general, the community present at
CalcorI 1, Hopper, and Nearshore on any one day was relatively
uniform, as expressed by genera present and percentage component
of the total community. The decrease in cell numbers on May 16
reflects the tailing off of the spring bloom in the Monterey Bay,
