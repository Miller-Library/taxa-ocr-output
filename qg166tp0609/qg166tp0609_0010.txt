depth of the mean light intensity could prevent photoinactivation
as the community moves into shallower water. Stratification
wheih occurred at CalcOFI 1 on May 15 is a good illustration of
this. Figure 17 presents the vertical density layers, showing
the thin layer of low density water from O to 5 meters in depth.
In order to make any generalizations about the relative
production rates at nearshore stations it will be necessary to
compile information throughout the annual cycle of hydrog:
raphic
conditions in the Monterey Bay. Phytoplankton populations could
fferent relationships between deep and shallow
possibly show d
water stations as the community composition changes during the
year. The absolut values of productivity and standing crop would
surely change but the relative values should stay the same.
Some variation in productivity and standing crop may be a
result of "patohes" or bands of phytoplankton, formed by local
current systems. Aerial photographs taken over Monterey Bay
during the fall season have shown bands of high chlorophyll
concentrations in the surface waters. However, this is considered
to be much more likely during the stratified conditions occurring
in the autumn months than during the period of study.

1) A significant decrease in productivity and standing crop
was observed between inshore stations which were 30 m. 200 m.
and 600 m from the shore, respectively, with the largest and
most significant change occurring from 30 meters to 200 meters
offshore.
