One factor which could influence the productivity and
standing crop is the breakdown of the phytoplankton as a result
of physical contact with the rocky shore, the shallow bottom,
or the sandy beach. The increase in the ratio of phaeophytin
to chlorophyll, could be the result of cell damage followed by
bleaching. Yentsch (1970) has suggested this as the principal
mechanism of chlorophyll degradation following cell fracture.
The physical breakdown of cells could account for some portion
of the reduction in standing crop and productivity. However,
the increase in phaeopigments in the shallow water could also
be a result of increasing contributions of benthic algal detritus
and wastes from intertidal animals. The digested food products
of a large filter-feeding population could contribute signif-
icantly to levels of phaeophytin, either by those animals in
the immediate area or perhaps by animals "upstream" of the study
area.
The presence of benthic algae in the shallower water may
also influence the productivity and standing crop of a phyto-
plankton population. A comparison of phytoplankton biomass
with that of the benthic algae illustrates the enormous amount
of benthic material present in the immediate vicinity of the
study area. Blinks (1955) gives the total biomass of nine major
benthic algae as 15 kg/m, while the biomass of phytoplankton
may reach 500 mg/m2 only under peak bloom conditions. Ryther
and Kramer (1961) demonstrated that an inshore species, Skele-
tonema costatum, requires 10 to 20 times the amount of minor
nutrients, e.g. iron, as offshore species. Recent work by
