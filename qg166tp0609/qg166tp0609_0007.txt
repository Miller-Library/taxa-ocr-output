Discussion
The significant decrease in primary production, with the
accompanying decreases in standing crop and direct cell counts
over the period of study indicate that extreme nearshore phytoÂ¬
plankton populations are exposed to conditions not normally
encountered by pelagic diatoms. The statistical significance
of the productivity decrease is P-.06; considering that two
additional parameters are also exhibiting the same trend, the
results become quite striking.
A complex system of hydrographic and biological factors
is operating in the shallower nearshore waters, possibly
providing different environmental conditions within a very
narrow spatial framework. Phytoplankton standing crop in the
open ocean is limited primarily by grazing of zooplankton and
limiting nutrient levels due to stratified water columns. It
is possible that zooplankton grazing is reducing the phytoplankton
population in extreme nearshore areas, however, the depth of
the water column at the inshore stations makes this a remote
possibility, since much of the zooplankton biomass need deeper
water for daily vertical migration.
Table 4 presents the ratio of phaeophytin to chlorophylla
for the five weeks of the study. The nearshore area consistent-
ly showed an increase in phaeophytin with respect to chlorophyll.
This ratio is often used as an index of grazing pressure on
phytoplankton, extreme nearshore areas, however, are affected
by many other factors creating phaeophytin, and grazing may
quantitatively be the least important.
