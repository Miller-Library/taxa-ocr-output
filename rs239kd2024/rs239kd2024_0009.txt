animals show the radius of extended tube feet to be approxiÂ¬
mately 0.46 mm., as oppose to 0.24mm in the prepared
specimens. The lumen volume calculated (3.5mm2) using this
value for ris actually larger than that of the relaxed
specimens, as required to be consistent with the classic view
of the operation of the tube foot.
Using the measured value of r-0.46 mm for the extended
foot, the strain calculated for the spiral fibers is 1.84,
Again, no explanation for this large extensibility is
immediately forthcoming.
Another artifact that could be present in this method
of sample preparation is again due to the fact that the
tube foot is stretched while there is no fluid in the lumen.
This could result in the detachment of the connective
tissue sheaths from the tube feet wall. If this is the case,
the radii measured on the prepared samples have no bearing
on the actual radii of the sheaths.
The second problem presented by the spiral fibers is:
(2) When a cylinder is pressurized, the hoop stress on the
cylinder wall is twice the longitudinal stress. (Wainwright
et al., 1976) (fig. 8) Consequently, for a cylinder
constructed from an isotropic material, the radius increases
at twice its rate of the length as the cylinder is pressurized.
Thus, if a cylinder such as a tube foot is to increase in
length rather than in girth, its circumferential (hoop)
stiffness must be at least twice that of its longitudinal
