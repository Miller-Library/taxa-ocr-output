Examination of cross-sections of tube foot stem under
the compound light microscope revealed 4 distinct layers.
Taken from the outside, these are:
(1) an outermost layer of cuticle;
(2) a layer of connective tissue sheath;
(3) a layer of longitudinally arranged muscular fibers
(4) a thin layer of ciliated epithelium that rests on
the lumen side of the muscle layer.
(fig. 1)
The thicknesses of layers 1-3, and the total wall thick-
ness of tube feet in the three states of extension were
estimated. (fig.1)
Examination with the polarizing light microscope (Aus
Jena, low power) showed the connective tissue sheath to
be composed of an outer and an inner layer. The fibers in
the outer layer have the same orientation as the fibers in
the muscular layer, and thus longitudinal. The fibers in
the inner connective tissye layer are oriented obliquely to
the longitudinal fibers in a right and left-hand double
spiral lattice.
The connective tissue layer is reported to be collagenous
by other authors. (Smith, 1946; Woodley, 1967) This is
consistent with the finding here that this layer stains with
Alcian blue.
Taking the relaxed specimens as the standard, the
measured radii and the observed fiber angles (6) can be used
