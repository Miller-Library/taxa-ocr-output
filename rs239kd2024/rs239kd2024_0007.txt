Discussion
The fiber angles in the inner layer of connective tissue were
observed to change when the tube foot was extended or
contracted, inconsistent with Smith's observation for
Astropecten irregularis that the fibers are circular.
(Smith, 1946) (fig.6) If the fibers were circular, the
fiber angles should not change as a function of extension.
and should remain at 90' to the longitudinal axis.
The presence of spiral fibers presents two problems
regarding the mechanism of tube foot extension:
(1) Clark And Cowey (1958), based on an analysis of
turbellarian and nemertean worms, show that the volume
enclosed by an inextensible spiral fiber wound cylinder
is defined by the equation:
Da sin e cos e
V=
(fig.7)
4 T
Thus, the volume is maximum when 6=54 44', and decreases
as 6 departs from this value. The relaxed tube feet of
P. ochraceous have a mean 6 of 42, whereas in the contracted
feet, 6=75, and in the extended ones, 6=6. Therefore,based
on this analysis, the volume of the tube foot will decrease
from the relaxed to the extended state. The lumen volume of
the tube foot was indeed observed to have decreased as the
tube foot is extended. (fig.6) However, this is inconsistent
with the accepted mechanism of the operation of the ampulla/
tube foot system. Tube foot extension is accomplished by
the contraction of the ampulla, forcing fluid into thelumen
Since fluid is incompressible, the lumen
of the tube foot.
