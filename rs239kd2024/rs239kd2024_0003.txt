Materials and Methods
I. Preparation of specimens
The tube feet of Pisaster ochraceous were in 3 states of
extention : (1) maximally stretched; (2) relaxed, and
(3) maximally contracted. For the stretehed and relaxed
tube feet, the starfish arm was relaxed in MgolÂ», and the
tube feet were amputated as close to the base as possible.
The extended tube feet were manually stretched to a point
where further extension would break the tube feet. They
were then pinned down and fixed with formaldehyde (37% in
sea water). The relaxed tube feet were pinned down and
fixed at their original lengths. Maximally contracted
tube feet were amputated from unrelaxed animals and fixed
without being pinned down.
Fixed tube feet were carefully dissected to expose their
layers. Dissection was made easier by soaking the tube feet
in a solution of 1M KOH mixed 1:1 by volume with glycerol.
(Woodley, 1967) After this treatment, the cuticle layer
and the internal longitudinal muscle layer were removed by
tearing them away with a pair of fine forceps. The outer
layer of connective tissue (composed of longitudinal
fibers) can also be partly removed by this manner,
II. Measurements
The tube foot, with the sucker removed, was slit along
its longitudinal axis, spread out, and mounted on a slide.
The specimens were viewed under the polarizing light
