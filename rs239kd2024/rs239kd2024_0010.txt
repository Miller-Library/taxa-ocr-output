stiffness.
For a fiber wound cylinder where the fibers are the only
elements resisting the internal pressure, the hoop stiffness
(Eg) and the longitudinal stiffness (Ep) are related to
the fiber angle (0):
EH= Ef sin e
E- Ef cos 0
Er=modulus of fiber along its axis
EH/E =2 if 0= 63° 26:
Eu/Er is larger than 2 if 0 is larger than 63° 26'.
The Eg and Ey, theoretical values for different extensional
states of tube feet are shown in figure 8. The contracted
tube feet exhibit fiber angles corresponding to a hoop
stiffness that is more than two times the longitudinal
stiffness. This indicates that the spiral fibers effectively
revent circumferential deformation only in the contracted
tube feet. Other structures must play this role in the
extended and relaxed tube feet, but the identity of these
structures is uncertain.
To summarize, this study has shown that the spiral
fibers allow the tube foot in P. ochraceous to extend by
being able to tolerate a large strain. Their role in the
prevention of circumferential deformation as the tube foot
is extended is only apparent in the contracted tube foot.
