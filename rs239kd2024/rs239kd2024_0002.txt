Introductio
Asteroid movement is primarily due to the operation of
tube feet. The tube feet are extended, attached to the
substratum, and then contracted, pulling the animal along
the substratum. The extension of the tube feet is accomplished
by the contraction of the ampulla, which forces the fluid
into the lumen of the tube foot. In order for there to be
an effective translation of this increase in volume to an
actual elongation of the tube foot, there must be some
structure preventing circumferential deformation of the tube
foot as the fluid volume inside the foot increases. At the
same time, this structure must allow the tube foot to extend.
In this study, the possibility is examined that the connective
tissue of the tube foot provides such a structure in
Pisaster ochraceous.
Tube foot morphology has been studied in detail by Smith
(1946), and the biomechanics of ophiuroid tube feet has been
analyzed by Woodley. (1979) However, no direct biomechanical
study has been done on asteroid tube feet. Clark and Cowey
have analyzed the fiber wound system in the basement
membrane of turbellarian worms and nemertean worms, (Clark,
1958) and the applicability of their findings to asteroid
tube feet will be examined.
