to calculate the length of 1 turn of fiber (L): L= 2wr/tano
(fig, 3) The number of turns of fiber (N) per relaxed tube
foot was estimated by N=length/L (fig. 2), N= 1.33.
The length of the fiber, D, was estimated by D-L/cos 6
(fig. 2) D=4.08mm.
If the fiber is assumed to be inextensible (D stays
constant at 4.08 mm when the tube foot is stretched or
contracted), the fiber angle can be predicted for the extended
and contracted tube feet by the relationship e-Sin" (2wr/D)
using 4.08 mm as D and the measured radius for each state as
r. (fig. 3) The predicted values of e did not agree well
with those observed (fig.4), indicating that D does not
stay constant. The new values of D which are consistent
with the observed e in the extended and contracted states
can be calculated using the observed 6 andr for each state.
(fig. 5) The strain on these fibers can also be calculated
as ln D'/D. (fig. 5)
Using the measured radii, lengths, and wall thicknesses
of tube feet, the lumen volume for each state of extension
can be calculated. (fig. 6) The lumen volume was observed
to have decreased when the tube foot was extended from a
value of 0.34mm2 to 0.25mm2. (fig. 6)
