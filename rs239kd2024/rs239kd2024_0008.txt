Tang
volume of the foot must increaseduring extension.
This seeming discrepancy can be explained in 2 ways:
(a) The fibers may be extensible to an extent greater than
expected, and the equation proposed by Clark and Cowey
therefore does not apply to this system. The strain on
the spiral fibers was calculated for extended and contracted
states, and was shown to be non-zero. (fig.5) The reported
value for vertebrate collagenous fibers is about 10%.
(Wainwright, et al., 1976) This agrees well with the strain
calculated for the contracted specimens of about 0.07. The
strain calculated for the extended tube feet (1.21) is
substantially larger than 102. The basis for this exten-
sibility is not clear. It may be conjectured however that
the fibers are kinked similarly to those in vertebrate
arteries (Wainwright, et al, 1976), and therefore allow
much more entension than expected. Further studies involving
electron microscopy are needed to verify this hypothesis.
(b) Although the actual measurements show that the lumen
volume does decrease, this could be entirely due to an
artifact introduced by the sample preparation. The tube
feet were extended by manually stretching them, whereas in live
animals, the tube feet areextended by pumping fluid in.
Thus, in a live animal, the cross-section stays circular as
the tube foot is extended, and the radius in the extended
tube foot is conceivably larger than the ones measured
in the fixed specimens. Indeed, observations in live
