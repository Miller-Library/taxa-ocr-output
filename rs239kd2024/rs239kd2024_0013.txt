Figure 1: Cross-section of tube foot, showing different
tissue layers and their dimensions at different
states of extension.
Figure 2
Schematic representation of an amputated tube foot
with the sucker removed.
Diagram only shows one
set of fiber in a double spiral system.
Figure 3:
A unit length of tube foot slit along the longitudinal
axis and unrolled out.

Figure 4:
Plot of radius vs. fiber angle of extended and
contracted tube feet. Solid line represents the preÂ¬
dicted values, assuming D remains constant at
4.08 mm; whereas the crosses, the observed values.
Figure 5:
Calculated D and strain for extended and contracted
tube feet.
Values reported are mean values in
units of mm.
extended tube feet: n-9, standard deviation (S.D.)
for D=2.36
contracted tube feet : n-10; S.D. for D-0.384
Figure 6:
Dimensions measured for tube feet at different
lengths.
Reported values are means in mm.
