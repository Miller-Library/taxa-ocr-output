microscope. The crossed fibers of the inner layer of
connective tissue were seen under careful examination, and
the fiber angle was measured as the angle rotated by the
stage between each set of fibers being at extinction.
In addition, the external dimensions of the tube foot
were measured with the use of vernier calipers. The thick-
ness of the sucker was similarly estimated, and the length
of the cylindrical portion of the tube foot obtained by
subtracting the sucker thickness from the overall length.
Since the tube feet were flat in the relaxed and extended
specimens, the diameters of them were estimated by squeezing
them between the calipers until the tube foot cross-section
was approximately circular. These measurements of radius
were confirmed by cross-sectioning tube feet of various
states with a freezing microtome; thickness of cuticle,
muscular layer, and connective tissue were measured from
these cross-sections.
