Abstract
In this study, the connective tissue sheaths in the tube
feet of Pisaster ochraceous were studied. The role played
by the spiral fibers in the inner layer of this sheath
during extension of the tube foot was also examined. This
was done by fixing the tube feet at various states of
extension, and by measuring the external dimensions and
the fiber angle of the fibers. These spiral fibers were
found to be extensible when the tube foot was extended or
contracted, and the value of strain for the extended tube
foot was very large. (1.84) The fibers were also found
to provide adequate hoop stiffness during the contracted
state to prevent circumferential deformation of the tube
foot.
