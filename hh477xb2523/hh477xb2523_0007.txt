coverage over the bottom of the three inch diameter finger bouls
in which the algal samples were placed. Complete coverage was
termed a large amount of sediment, partial coverage, moderate.
sparse coverage, small, and no sediment, zero. Figure 6 shows
a comparison of the mean numbers of individuals of the four most
abundant taxa per four square inch sample. The samples are ar¬
ranged in order of decreasing amount of sediment per sample.
For R. affine, significant differences (p=0.01) exist between
samples with large and small amounts of sediments for all four
taxa, and for G. papillata, between large and small and large
and zero samples. The figure does not present a comparison be¬
tween R. affine and G. papillata. Rather, it examines the dif-
ferences, within each algal species, between samples containing
different amounts of sediment. The data show clearly that, for
both algae, the number of animals present varies directly with
the amount of trapped sediment.
A direct comparison of the mean numbers of individuals
per gram dry weight of sampled material (algae plus holdfasts
and associated sediments) for the two plant species is shown
in figure 7. Significant differences (p-0.01) exist between R.
affine and G. papillata in the numbers of animals of the five
most abundant taxa, Nematoda, Copepoda, Barleeia haliotiphila,
Tricolia pulloides, and Lasaea cistula, Keen, 1938, per gram dry
weight of sampled material.
The fact that R. affine is more effective in trapping
coarser sédiment particles than G. papillata suggests the pos¬
sibility that it might provide a safer refuge than G. papillata
for larger animals, although the same mesofaunal taxa occur in
