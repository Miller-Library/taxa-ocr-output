and (b)Where differences exist, what factors are correlated with
these differences?
All studies were carried out in April and May, 1979, on
and about Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, within the
research reservation around the Hopkins Marine Station. Three
sampling areas were chosen, each with a good population of R.
affine but each exposed to a different degree of wave action
(figure 1). Area A is the least protected, as it faces the open
surf. Area C, protected by the rocky islets to the north, re-
ceived a moderate degree of wave action. Area B, located on the
lee side of a small offshore island, received virtually no wave
action. Degree of wave action was estimated by observing the
study sites at high tide on six occasions and counting the num¬
ber of waves breaking or impacting directly on or near the site.
Field sampling techniques were as follows. Standing
three feet behind the inshore border of the R. affine forest,
I established a benchmark and starting there, measured off a
square area two hundred inches on a side, with each side divi¬
ded into ten units, each twenty inches long. This provided a
square containing ten quadrats, each 20x20 inches square. With¬
in each sampling area, arandom numbers table was used to select
particular quadrats for study. It was desired to sample one
quadrat from the low, medium, and high regions of the R. affine
belt. After the first 20x20 inch quadrat was chosen, ran¬
dom coordinates were generated until a quadrat from each of the
other two heights had been selected. Positions of quadrats
chosen for study were marked by tying yellow plastic surveyors
tape to algae at the four corners. Within each selected quad¬
rat, a sampling frame was used, divided into one hundred 2x2
