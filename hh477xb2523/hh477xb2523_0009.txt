2. Although the same taxonomic groups of small animals are
present in R. affine and G. papillata, mesofaunal popula-

3. Populations of mesobiota in both plants appear to vary
most directly with the amount of sediment present.
4. No size differences exist between mesobiota in R. affine
and G. papillata.
