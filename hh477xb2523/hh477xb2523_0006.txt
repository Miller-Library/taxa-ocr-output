in suspension, and R. affine grows in such thick, even lawns,
that it appears to trap coarse sediments well even where the
surf pounds over the plants at high tide.
For G. papillata (figure 5) the situation is different.
The sampling areas are arranged in the order of decreasing mean
amounts of sediment per sample, and only the four most abundant
taxa are shown. In G. papillata, the mean amount of sediment
per sample did not correspond directly or inversely with the de¬
gree of wave action. Significant differences (p-0.01) exist be¬
tween sampling areas C and B in Nematoda, Copepoda, and Barleeia
haliotiphila and between sampling areas C and B in Tricolia
pulloides. The trend from high to low mean counts per sample
varies more or less with the amount of sediment per sample ex¬
cept in the case of Tricolia pulloides. However, area C, with
the greatest amount of sediment per sample, still has the high¬
est number of gastropods, and in addition, the mean number of
Tricolia pulloides per square is low in both areas B and A.
In general, the mesofaunal population of G. papillata seems to
vary directly with the amount of sediment present. For G. pap-
illata, area A, the most wave swept, has the lowest amount of
sediment per sample. Area C, which receives a moderate degree
of wave action, has the highest amount of sediment. A possible
explanation of this is that the sediment in area C, mainly sand,
is trapped more readily by G. papillata than is the sandy and
shelly sediment mixture common to area A.
In order to determine more directly the relation between
mesofaunal abundances and sediments, I made qualitative analyses
of the amount of sediment per sample by estimating the sediment
