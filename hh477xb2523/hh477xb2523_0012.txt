Percent composition of mesobiota by taxonomic groups;
based on 54 samples of each plant species. Total
numbers of individuals counted for R. affine, 2640,
for G. papillata, 1022.
Figure 1
R. affine: differences in populations of mesobiota
from sampling areas A, B, and C, arranged in descend¬
ing order of mean numbers of individuals per four
square inch sample, for all 54 samples. Vertical bars
show range, mean, and standard deviation.

G. papillata: differences in populations of mesobiota
from sampling areas A, B, and C, arranged in order of
decreasing amount of sediment per four square inch
sample, for all 54 samples. Vertical bars show
range, mean, and standard deviation.
For R. affine and G. papillata individually, com-

parison of mean numbers of individuals per four
square inch sample, arranged in order of decreasing
amounts of sediment. Vertical bars show range,
mean, and standard deviation.

Comparison of body lengths of animals associated with
R. affine and G. papillata. Vertical bars show range,
mean, and standard deviation. Numbers above bars
show the number of individuals measured.
