both plants. Figure 8 compares the sizes of the animals found
in R. affine and G. papillata. No significant differences in
size were found.
Figure 9 compares R. affine and G. papillata with re-
spect to the mean numbers of individuals per unit area for the
four most abundant taxa. Significant differences (p-0.001)
exist between R. affine and G. papillata in all three sampling
areas for Nematoda, in areas A and B for Copepoda, and in area
A for Tricolia pulloides. There is a significantly greater numÂ¬
ber of animals per sample in R. affine than in G. papillata.
Perhaps R. affine contains more individuals than G. papillata
because R. af
Fine grows in thick, even lawns which not only
trap sediments well but also offer a habitat better protected
against wave action and dessication. In contrast, G. papillata
is more sparsely branched, forms sparser patches on the granite
substratum, and does not trap sediments as well. Fine organic
detritus is found clinging to the blades of both algal species,
but more is probably trapped, along with sediments, by R. affine.
Detritus and associated microorganisms are probably a main food
source for Nematods, Copepods, and Lasaea cistula, three of the
most abundant taxa, and they may contribute, at least in part,
to the diets of other organisms present in the R. affine belt.
SUMMARY
1. The mesofauna associated with the red algae R. affine and
G. papillata, in the lower midtide zone, includes, in order
of abundance: Nematoda, Copepoda, Barleeia haliotiphila,
