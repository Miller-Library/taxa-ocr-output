inch squares. A random numbers table was used to choose par¬
ticular 2x2 inch squares within the 20x20 inch quadrat. If
R. affine was absent from one of the selected 2x2 inch areas,
coordinates for another square were randomly chosen until six
samples were taken from each quadrat. If six samples could not
be collected from the quadrat, a new quadrat was chosen. To
sample each 2x2 inch square, a plexiglas sampler (figure 2),
having an inside area of four square inches, was firmly pressed
onto the substrate at the site of the randomly selected square.
A foam rubber rim provided a good seal to the rock surface in
most areas. A rubber bulb and plastic tube were used to squirt
two to three ounces of hot (+30° C.) fresh water into the sam¬
pler to kill any animals that might otherwise escape during sam¬
pling. The water containing the small organisms was immediately
sucked back up into the plastic tube and deposited into a la¬
belled collection bag. The erect algae, including their hold¬
facts, and any sediments present were then removed with a sharp
knife and deposited in the same bag. In each of the three sam¬
pling areas, three 20x20 inch quadrats were chosen and six 2x2
inch samples of the R. affine forest were taken per 20x20 inch
quadrat for a total of fifty-four samples. In the laboratory,
the samples were placed in finger bowls and examined under a
dissecting scope. Counts were made of all animals present in
the size range 0.25-11 millimeters. The mesofauna of G. pap-
illata was sampled from the same sample areas, and from the same
20x20 inch quadrats previously sampled, using the same tech¬
niques. In cases where six samples of G. papillata could not
be taken from a marked quadrat, random numbers were generated
