One of the most common red algae of the rocky shore
in California is Rhodoglossum affine. Another red algal species,
Gigartina papillata, overlaps R. affine in its vertical range,
though it extends somewhat higher in the intertidal zone. To-
gether with other less abundant algae these species form a low
forest or turf in the midtide zone. The larger animals of this
zone are well known (e.g. Ricketts and Calvin, 1968), and the
community of smaller organisms inhabiting the Balanus glandula-
Endocladia muricata zone in the upper intertidal has been studied
in some detail (Glynn, 1965). However, the mesobiota of the mid¬
tide algal forest has received little attention. This biota is
the subject of the present investigation.
Studies were directed toward determining whether the
mesofauna of these algae forms a relatively consistent associa¬
tion or community. Specifically, the following questions were
asked. In the zone occupied by the main population of Rhodo-
glossum affine, (1)What animals occur on R. affine, what forms
on G. papillata, and in what numbers are they present? (2) Does
the mesofauna of R. affine differ from that of G. papillata?
(3)Is there a significant difference in the nature and abundance
of mesobiota in samples taken from low, medium, and high regions
of the R. affine belt? (4) Considering R. affine and G. papillata
individually with regard to the composition and numbers of the
mesofauna: (a)Do differences exist between the mesofauna popu¬
lations in different areas, exposed to different conditions?
