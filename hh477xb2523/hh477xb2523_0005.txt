of mesobiota. No significant variations were found. One pos¬
sible explanation of this is that the R. affine belt itself is
narrow in the study sites, on the average extending vertically
for about three feet in the lower midtide zone, from about mean
lower low water to approximately the three foot level. All
parts are submerged twice a day, and in a given area receive
roughly the same degree of turbulence and exposure to other en¬
vironmental factors. Since no significant differences were
found between means of samples from each 20x20 inch quadrat in
each sampling area, data from the three quadrats in each area
were combined and examined together.
In order to determine whether there were differences
between sampling areas A, B, and C in the abundance of mesobiota
associated with R. affine and G. papillata, pooled data for
the quadrats in each area were examined (figures 4 and 5).
In figure 4, for R. affine, only the four most abundant taxa
are plotted, and the three sampling areas, A, B, and C, are ar-
ranged in order of decreasing mean counts of individual organ¬
isms per four square inch sample. This order, A, C, B, also
corresponds with a decreasing degree of wave action in the sam¬
pling areas, and decreasing mean amounts of sediment per sample
of R. affine. Significant differences (p-0.01) occur between
sample areas A and B and also C and B in Nematoda, and between
sampling areas A and B in Tricolia pulloides. In general, high
mean counts per sample correspond to greater wave action and
larger amounts of sediment per sample. I did not expect to find
more trapped sediment in the region of a greater wave action.
However, perhaps the greater wave action results in more sediment
