to determine from which immediately adjacent 20x20 inch quadrat
the remaining G. papillata samples would be taken. All samples
of algae and sediments were dried for twenty-four hours on open
foil plates in an oven at 50° C. and then weighed on a Mettler
scale accurate to 0.Ol grams. Algae and sediments were dried
together as it was often difficult to completely separate the
two. Very small numbers of mesobiota might have remained at¬
tached to either the algae or sediments during the drying and
weighing processes.
The results obtained are shown in figures 3-9. The
major findings are indicated and discussed below.
Figure 3 compares the composition of the mesobiota of
R. affine and G. papillata, based on the pooled data of all
samples taken. No major qualitative differences occur in the
fauna associated with the two plant species. In terms of num¬
bers of individuals, Nematoda are the most abundant animals on
both algae, comprising 1/3 and 1/4 of the total fauna ofR. affine
and G. papillata, respectively. Copepoda make up approximately
1/5 of the fauna in both algae, and the small gastropods Tri¬
colia pulloides (Carpenter, 1865) and Barleeia haliotiphila
Carpenter, 1864, comprise between 1/6 and 1/10 of the mesobiota,
with the relative abundances of these snails reversed in the
two algae. Mites make up 1/10 of the G. papillata mesofauna.
Other forms are found in lesser abundance.
While the upper and lower boundaries of the R. affine
belt were not specifically examined, the samples from low, med¬
ium, and high regions within the main R. affine belt were stud-
ied for possible differences in the composition and abundance
