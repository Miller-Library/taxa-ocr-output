Introduction
The Cnidarian medusae Tripedalia Cystophora, found in the waters of Puerto Rico,
is a member of class Cubozoa. Cubomedusae are gelatinous organisms capable of bellÂ¬
pulsing locomotion but are unable to swim against strong currents. Members of class
Cubozoa (formerly included in the Scyphozoa) differ in several unique characteristics,
including their box shaped exumbrella, a more potent nematocyst toxin, and rhopalial
sensory stalks having complex eyes with cornea, spherical lenses and retinal cells
connected to nerve fibers (Yomatsu & Yoshida, 1976; Laska and Hundgen, 1982). T.
Cystophora is a smaller member of the class, having a noticeably cube shaped bell of
about one cm in diameter. Their rhopalial stalks are positioned on each "wall" of their
cubic bell, with the complex eyes facing inward, one upward and one downward. Each
rhopalial stalk contains two complex eyes, two eyes slits with rudimentary enlongated
lenses, and two simple ocelli (Stewart 1995). As their sixteen ocelli (light sensitive
organs) are adequate for directional light sensing by themselves, this study attempts to
provide stimuli that mimic images of potential behavioral importance in order to
determine the role of their apparently camera-type eyes. Given the elaborate design of
their complex eyes and their apparent high level of visually organized behavior
(Matsumoto, 1995, and Stewart, 1995), it remains to be determined whether or not
Cubozoans have more than mere directional light sensitivity, or in fact have image
forming eyes.
There has been much interest among researchers as to the presence of a complex eye
and no apparent brain or centralized nervous system; debate remains as to if and how the
