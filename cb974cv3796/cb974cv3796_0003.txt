medusae’s ganglionic nerve ring processes and responds to images so as to coordinate
image oriented behavior. Field studies of T. Cystophora in its natural mangrove habitat
have shown the medusae feeding by making "passes" through the light shafts caused by
the overhanging foliage and mangrove roots (Stewart 1995). The theoretical interest of
this study is the relationship between the behavior of T. Cystophora and the dynamics of
these light shafts, with particular interest as to the capabilities of their visual system.
Behavioral studies have shown that Cubozoans are attracted by light and bright objects,
and are repelled by darkness and dark objects, such as divers, seagrass beds, and wharf
pilings (Matsumoto, 1995 and Page, 19
Methods-
My Apparatus was designed to mimic a light shaft as it would occur in a mangrove
swamp. I placed a focused illuminator at one end of the long axis of a 60 * 30 * 30 cm
rectangular tank, one sixth of the way down the tank, as shown in Fig. 4. It produced a
tight cone of light, 2 cm in diameter at the top and 4 cm at the bottom, much like a light
shaft in sea or lagoon water. In all of my experiments, I videotaped the tank with a low
light camera as I turned the light column on and off; I used two diffuse red lamps
suspended high above the tank to provide ambient light. The lights were sufficiently
diffüse so that the medusae showed no sign of their characteristic phototactic response.
The tank was surrounded by neutral gray paper.
My method of observing preference was to plot the horizontal locations of the jellyfish
at regular intervals during a given trial, and then take the mean horizontal location for a
given time and compare the means over the time of the experiment. I did so by analyzing
