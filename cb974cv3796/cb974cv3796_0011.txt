Figure 1. The above graph shows the mean horizontal position of the cubomedusae vs. time, with
vertical lines at 180 sec and 300 sec to show when the light went on (180) and off (300). The spectra of
the filter are listed in the legend and representative lines are color matched to their respective wavelength.
The light was located at 50, represented by the horizontal line.
