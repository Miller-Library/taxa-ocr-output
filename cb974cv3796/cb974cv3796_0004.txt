the videotape of the experiment and plotting the positions off of the tape, using arbitrary
units of measurement such that the tank measured 300 of these units in length, so each
unit of displacement was 0.2 cm of the actual tank. As my goal was to link changes in
light to changes in behavior, I always had 3 minutes of darkness before 2 minutes of the
light cone followed by another 3 minutes of darkness; this was to allow them to
randomize, which they do quite significantly at the onset of darkness.
Methods: Color Preference
Firstly 1 tested the reactions of the cubomedusae to light shafts of different colors,
spanning from red to ultraviolet. To test the animalsâ€™ response to a given color, I would
place one of six 2"*2" filters on a small, transparent plexi-glass suspension bridge over
the tank such that the entire beam of the illuminator passed through the filter into the
water. The filters were of the following wavelengths: 380 nm (violet), 440 nm (blue),
480 nm (blue), 515 nm (green), 540 nm (green), and 700 nm (red) and all of the same
optical density, allowing 40% of the light to pass through. Then, I used a Mineralight UV
lamp to repeat the experiment with 254 nm and 365 nm UV light. The Mineralight UV
lamp was significantly more diffuse than the beam of the illuminator, so it was not
compared to the other colors. The Color experiments were all done in succession, on the
same hour in the same day.
Methods: Light Texture
My second experimental series studied the changes in the behavior of T.
Cystophora in response to changes in the texture of the light shaft; I am defining texture
in this case as local variations within the visual field at a given time. To test this, I used
