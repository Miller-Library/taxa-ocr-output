colors, the reaction was strongest for blue at 480 nm, followed by blue at 440 nm, violet
at 380 nm, green at 540, and red at 700 nm. Only blue at 480 nm was significant over
the other colors, p=0.034, and blue at 440 nm was almost so, p-0.052, given a double
tailed t-test with a alpha of 0.05. The mean horizontal displacement in response to the
short wave ultraviolet (254 nm) did not significantly change. The long wave UV (365
nm), however, elicited a change in mean horizontal displacement from 142 to 118 while
the light was on, with the lamp at approx. 70 (again, tank length 300), as shown in Fig. 2.
The light from the UV Lamp was significantly more diffuse than that from the
illuminator; it was not so much of a shaft of light as it was simply shining on that quarter
of the tank.
For the texture experiments, with the light at 50, the mean horizontal displacement of
the cubomedusae reached 108 for normal white light (Fig. 3). For the tube of Brine
Shrimp, the mean displacement reached 96. For the small cubozoans within the light
column, the mean displacement reached 69. The mean displacement without light was
141.
Discussion: Color Preference
Given the significant preference for blue at 480 nm, it seems that color of light
can influence the cubomedusan behavior. This may be due to blue shifted opsins; 480
nm is the wavelength of light which most readily penetrates sea water. This finding
would support the Sensitivity theory of vision, which says that an individual sees best in
what wavelengths are most available in a given visual system (Lythgoe, 1979). Given the
nature of the visual system of T. Cystophora, this could account for increased sensitivity
