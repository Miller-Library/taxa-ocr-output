to the location of light shafts at distances greater than one meter, through horizontally
scattered light which appear blue (Loew and Lythgoe, 1985). Further support for these
conclusions will require increased knowledge of the opsins of the cubomedusan eye.
Futher experiments in which order of light exposure is varied may show even more
conclusive behavioral preference, perhaps mimicking natural enviromental cycles and
wavelength distributions.
Again defining texture as localized differences in the visual field at a given time,
my texture experiments were tailored to examine degree of change in behavior to change
in texture. Although both the shrimp tube trial and the young cubomedusan light trap trial
were statistically significant over white light shaft alone, the nature of the increased
response is unclear; the stimuli clearly cause changes in mean position, but it could be
due to the texture of the light shaft or simply to increased intensity of horizontally
scattered light. The observed preferences may be representative of secondary
characteristics of the eyes, i.e. a movement response mechanism, image response
mechanism, etc., but better controlled stimuli will be necessary, with more clearly
defined visual signal characteristics. Further experiments which compare chemically
neutral objects that are moving within the light column and scatter as much horizontal
light as a more intense control light column might show actual preference.
There has been doubt that image formation is possible with the application of
optical theory to the cubomedusan complex eye; the spherical lens of T. Cystophora
would have to have a refractive index greater than that of any known biological lens
substance in order to form images given its distance from the retina (Land, 1981 and
Nilsson, 1989). However, the inferometric placement of their sixteen ocelli being
