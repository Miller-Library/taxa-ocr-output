sufficient to detect directional light sources, the presence of their complex eye system
implies higher function other than directional phototaxis. Given inward position of their
complex eyes, it is possible that by looking through their bell they create an effective
compound lens; although it is highly transparent, it may have regions with sufficiently
high refractive properties to accomplish this. Analysis of this could be conducted with by
testing the index of refraction of the regions of the bell; the use of a laser pointer was
suggested by Christian Reilly. If the eyes are not image forming, however, then perhaps
they are light detection mechanisms of a greater quality than the ocelli can provide,
perhaps infering distance to target quantities from inferometry. Given their apparently
heightened blue sensitivity, long distance light shaft detection (hence blue light) might
explain the need for complex eyes. Experiments to test their ability to sense shafts of
different colors at long distances (or at short distances and of low densities) might shed
light on this possibility.
Conclusions:
T. Cystophora demonstrated preference to blue light at 480 nm over several other
colors, but without knowledge of the opsins of the cubomedusan eye, the presence of
color vision or simply blue shifted opsins isn’t conclusive. Also, T. Cystophora’s
preference for visually “loaded" textural schemes of an analog of a mangrove light shaft
versus an empty light shaft may display image processing and response, or possibly only
an direct relationship between light intensity and strength of phototactic response.
