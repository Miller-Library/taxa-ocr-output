the same apparatus as in the color preference experiment, yet this time, altering the
texture of the illuminator’s light column so as to provide analogs to images and textures
from the cubomedusae’ s natural habitat. Firstly, I applied the cone of light alone (3 min
of darkness, 2 min of light cone, 3 min of darkness), as shown in Fig. 4. This was to
simulate a simple light shaft. Secondly, I placed a 30 cm * 3 cm diameter cylindrical
glass tube, capped at the bottom, densely filled with brine shrimp, in the path of the light
shaft, so that the light shaft was contained within the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 5. The
same 3/2/3 conditions were applied to this setup. This setup was an attempt to mimic the
rapid swimming motions of their copepod prey, Oithona nana (Stewart, 1995). Lastly, I
removed the shrimp column and subjected the cubomedusae to 3 min of darkness; upon
turning on the light, I injected directly down into the light column roughly 25 young
cubomedusae, the largest no greater than 2 mm in bell diameter, as shown in Fig. 6. I left
the light shaft on for 2 min, then subjected the cubomedusae to 3 min of darkness. The
young cubomedusae are highly phototactic and the illumator'’s light column acted as a
sort of trap, keeping the young cubomedusae within in for the length of the illumination.
The purpose of using young cubomedusae was to place bright reflective moving specks in
the light column, in order to simulate their copepod prey, potential mates, or simply other
feeding cubomedusae.
Results
For each of the six filter colors, T. Cystophora exhibited its characteristic
phototactic behavior, shown in Fig. 1. All such reactions (changes in mean horizontal
location) were statistically significant over no light (all p«0.01). As far as preference for
