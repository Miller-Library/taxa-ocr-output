Abstract
The purpose of my experiments was to test the behavioral response and capabilities of
the cubomedusan Tripedalia Cystophora to various visual stimuli; My hypothesis was
that the cubomedusae would respond more strongly (be more attracted to) color toward
the blue end of the visual spectrum as well as to reflective small objects within the water
that mimic their food sources. Lab Experiments showed that T. Cystophora did indeed
favor blue light (440 nanometers, 480 nanometers) over red light (700 nanometers) when
a tight cone of light of a given color was placed at a the end of a rectangular tank. Green
light was intermediatly favored (515 nanometers, 540 nanometers) as was violet light
(385) nanometers. Experiments also showed that T. Cystophora were attracted to long
wave Ultra Violet Light (365 nanometers) but not significantly to short wave Ultra Violet
(254). Also, in experiments testing preference for texture of the light cone, T. Cystophora
favored reflective bodies within the light cone (chemically neutral brine shrimp, small T.
Cystophora) over only the light cone. A uniform rising movement was also noticed upon
the onset of darkness.
