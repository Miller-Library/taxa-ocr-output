phosphorylation of the cyclin subunit, causing entry into
mitosis 4 5 6 7 8 The transition from metaphase to anaphase is
induced by the inactivation of MPF, which is itself caused by
cyclin degradation. As interphase is reached, cyclin degradation
ceases and its accumulation begins again. Many have shown that
blocking or inhibiting cyclin degradation during mitosis causes
cells to arrest in metaphase; one method used cyclin mutants
which were resistant to proteolysis.9
Less is presently known about the mechanisms for exit from
mitosis than for entry into mitosis. It has been shown that
cyclin degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin pathway 10
destruction box" in the amino-terminal of cyclin itself seems
necessary for its destruction. A cyclin phosphatase also seems
needed to deactivate cyclin; using okadaic acid or antiÂ¬
phosphatase antibodies to inhibit type 1 protein phosphatases
caused stabilization of histone Hl kinase and MPF activity. 11 It
was shown that cyclin degradation also seems regulated in some
way by odc2 kinase activity, creating a feedback mechanism in the
control of MPF activity. 12 A lag of 25 minutes until degradation
was observed.
In my experiments, using sea urchin eggs suspended in a ph
6.7 buffered sea water before the onset of mitosis, arrest at
metaphase was observed. Since cyclin degradation is required for
exit from metaphase, this lead to speculation that a pH sensitive
step was important somewhere in the pathway of MPF deactivation.
An MPF assay showed that, in fact, histone HI kinase activity, a
