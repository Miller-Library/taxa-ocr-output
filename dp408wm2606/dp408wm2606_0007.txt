forms. They did not migrate towards the poles but seemed to stay
attached to the end of the spindle microtubules. The beginning
of anaphase, or the separation of the kinetechores, could have
been reached, but without the normal depolymerization of the
microtubule fibers. Some of the other abnormal metaphase eggs
could be accounted for by the poorly developed mitotic apparatus
or the extra spindles.
Histone HI Kinase Activity Does Not Cycle
The Hl Kinase assay showed that MPF activity increased and stayed
at an elevated level in the eggs subjected to the pH 6.7 acetate
buffer sea water. Hl Kinase activity increased more rapidly than
the controls and remained at a high level as the controls cycled.
In all assays, Hl Kinase activity rises at the same time, or just
after, the controls. It then peaks at about 1.5x the highest
levels of the controls and stays close to this level for the next
couple of hours. Some fluctuations are present over all
experiments that seem similar; the peak rises very quickly, then
drops by about 20% only to rise again and then stay fairly level
for the duration of the experiment. (Fig 3, a-b)
It is noteworthy that HI Kinase activity remains high and
does not cycle like the controls, indicating that MPF was not
inactivated in the eggs that were in the acidic buffer.
Cytological observation revealed that in the controls, the
pro-metaphase stage in development corresponded to the peak in HI
kinase activity. (Fig 3,c)
