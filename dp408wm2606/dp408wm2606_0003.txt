direct measure of MPF, did not cycle but stayed at an elevated
level. It appears that some pathway for cyclin destruction is
very ph sensitive.
Materials and Methods
Animals
The sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus was used in all cell
cycle experiments. Spawning was done by physical disturbance
and/or injecting with .5 M KCl. Sperm was collected dry and kept
cold. Eggs were poured through a 90 nm mesh to remove impurities
and some of the jelly coat. Eggs were kept stirred in a 17' C
water bath until used. Fertilization was induced by diluting
sperm in sea water and adding to an egg suspension. Eggs were
kept stirred if suspension was above.1%. When suspending in
buffer solution, eggs were first centrifuged to allow pouring off
of sea water. Eggs were then resuspended in buffer solution.
Buffer solution
The buffer solution used was 50mM Pipes, 25mM Na Acetate, and sea
water. This solution was brought to desired pH and kept at same
temperature of eggs in water bath.
Cytological Observation and Fixation
5% aliquots of eggs were removed from sea water or acetate
buffer at desired times after fertilization and resuspended in a
1 ml KGE and Triton solution. A 100 ml KGE solution contained
7 gm K Gluconic Acid, 2.4 gm Glycine, 76 mg EGTA, 48 mg
MgCl2 (6H20) and distilled water and was brought to pH 6.0. A 1%
