arrest. (Fig 1, a-d)
To determine if pH was important for subsequent cell cycles,
developing sea urchin eggs were resuspended in acetate after
completion of the first cleavage. Again the pattern of slow
development and eventual metaphase arrest was observed;
developing eggs arrested at the metaphase/anaphase transition in
the two cell stage. (Fig 2, a,b)
Abnormalities Observed in Prolonged Metaphase Arrest
Cytological observation revealed some abnormalities in cell
structure and development in eggs incubated in the pH 6.7 buffer,
The most obvious difference was the mitotic apparatuses were not
as apparent as in the controls. The spindles seemed less
developed than controls; microtubules were shorter and less
abundant and the centers were not as far apart. Spindle
formation also took place at a slower rate than controls and
never became fully developed in most cells.
Another abnormality was the presence of one or two extra
microtubule centers in eggs that developed in buffer for a couple
of hours. Polyspermy was not present in these cells, especially
at the frequency of multiple spindles observed. Not all cells
contained an extra spindle. Cells with two spindles would
sometimes have elongated centrosomes,
Abnormal metaphase was also observed in many cells after
continued arrest in the metaphase position. The chromosomes
appeared to fan out and disperse but still retain their condensed
