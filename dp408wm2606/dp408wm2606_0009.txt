Hl Kinase assays. Cyclin could still be degraded while odc2
becomes active again, preventing development out of metaphase.
Another possibility includes the ubiquitin pathway being
directly affected by pH. If ubiquitin conjugation is somehow
prevented, cyclin will not be targeted for degradation and Hl
Kinase activity will not decrease. Also if the proteolytic
enzyme is inhibited by acidic pH, similar results might be
observed.
A Ca++ transient dependant Kinase may also be responsible
for the pH sensitivity in HI Kinase activity. It is thought that
a Ca+t transient signal at metaphase helps trigger the cell to
degrade cyclin and that Ca++ sequestration is very pH sensitive.
Inhibition of this signal could result, leading to sustained HI
kinase activity.
Any of the intermediate steps, or many of them, in any of
these given, or unknown, possibilities could exhibit a pH
sensitivity that might affect MPF activity. The results cannot
differentiate between any of these possibilities. In various
methods, experiments in the future might try to determine pH
effects on specific known steps of cyclin degradation and MPE
activity.
