Discussion
These results show that lowering the external pH in which eggs
are developing effects internal mechanisms in a profound way.
If
added before pronuclear fusion, it arrests sea urchin eggs at
this stage. If added after this sensitive time, it slows mitosis
considerably and eventually arrests mitosis at metaphase. The
explanation for this appears to be the prevention of inactivation
of MPF, since it has been shown that inactivation of MPF is the
signal that triggers onset of anaphase and continued progression
through mitosis. Since inactivation of MPF is caused ultimately
by the destruction of cyclin, acidic pH probably prevents this
destruction.
It was shown in starfish,10 that okadaic acid, a inhibitor
of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, prevented MPF inactivation
probably by preventing cyclin degradation. Other similarities
exist in the okadaic acid experiment and my experiment s results,
including pronuclear fusion arrest, prevention of normal spindle
and microtubule formation, as well as metaphase arrest.
This
correlation points to the cyclin phosphatases that are
responsible for oyclin degradation as possible candidates for ph
sensitivity.
Cdc2 kinase activity may also exhibit pH sensitivity.
If
the odc2 kinase protein can stay active in acidic pH without
being bound to the cyclin subunit, HI Kinase activity would
probably be observed. This might also account for the immediate
drop in activity followed by increasing activity observed in the
