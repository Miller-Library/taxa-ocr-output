Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Dr. Epel for being a very positive and
helpful advisor and for giving me many of the ideas and
explanations for my project and research. I am also very
indebted to Chris Patton, without whom the HI Histone assay would
not have been possible. Also thanks to Rob Swezey, for valuable
ideas, and the rest of the Epel lab for their help. I also want
to thank everyone at Hopkins for a wonderful and enjoyable
experience.
