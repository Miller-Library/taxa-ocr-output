External Acidic pH Causes Metaphase Arrest
And Inhibits Histone Hl Kinase Inactivation
In the Sea Urchin Embryo
Abstract
The development of sea urchin eggs in a 6.7 pH buffer causes
slowed progression through mitosis with eventual arrest in
metaphase and sustained levels of Histone HI Kinase activity.
pH sensitive step or a number of steps must exist in the
pathway for inactivation of MPF or histone HI Kinase, probably by
effecting the destruction of cyclin. The developing eggs were
arrested at metaphase because the signal for progression through
anaphase, MPF inactivation, never appeared.
Introduction
The cell cycle is now known to be largely controlled by the
phosphorylating activity of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF).1 2
Activation of MPF induces mitosis and deactivation of MPF is
required for the exit from mitosis. MPF has been shown to be
made up of two distinct subunits, cyclin and the odc2 molecule.3
Cdc2 is known to be a mitotic kinase that is activated by the
regulatory cyclin, whose activity and abundance follows the cell
cycle. During interphase, cyclin is synthesized and accumulates
until the beginning of metaphase. As cyclin levels rise, it
binds to the inactive un-phosphorylated form of odc2. Cdc2 is
then phosphorylated creating an inactive form of MPF. This preÂ¬
MPF is made active by dephosphorylation of odc2 and
