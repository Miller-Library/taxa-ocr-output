portion of the detergent triton was dissolved in this solution.
After 5 minutes, 20 ul of formaldehyde was added to each 1 ml
sample of eggs. The samples were then stored in the cold. In
order to determine proper stage in mitosis, a fluorescent dye
that stains DNA was used. Samples were centrifuged and KGE,
triton and formaldehyde solution was aspirated away. 1 ml of KGE
containing the fluorescent dye, DAPI, was added to samples. A
microscope equipped with fluorescent bulb and proper filters was
used to view eggs.
listone Hl Kinase Assay
Hl Kinase assay was performed according to Meijer and Pondaven
procedure with slight modifications. 13 The homogenization buffer
contained 60 mM B-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate,
25 mM Hepes, 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, .1 mM
Na Vanadate, and .1 mM potassium fluoride. Similar modifications
were made with the assay buffer: 1.1 ul protein kinase inhibitor,
8 mg histone in a 1 ml final volume.
Results
Incubating developing sea urchin eggs in the sea waterÂ¬
acetate buffer at pH 6.7, revealed two distinct periods of
sensitivity to this treatment along with a general slowing trend
throughout mitosis. The first period is before pro-nuclear
fusion; the second period is before metaphase.
