Development Arrests Before Pro-Nuclear Fusion
The first period of sensitivity exists in the first 30 minute
period after fertilization. Sea urchin eggs were removed from
sea water and resuspended in a pH 6.7 buffer at various time
intervals and subsequent development was followed. Aliquots of
eggs were fixed in KGE at various times to determine mitosis
progression. In cells where pronuclear fusion had not taken
place, the sperm pro-nuclei could be seen on its migration toward
the egg pro-nuclei. These cells would be arrested at this
position for several hours with no noticeable difference. No
spindles or asters were recognized in these cells. If pronuclear
fusion had already taken place, cells would begin developing at a
slow rate when resuspended in 6.7 pH buffer,
Development Arrests At Metaphase/Anaphase Transition
Suspending developing eggs in the buffer after 45 minutes, well
after pronuclear fusion, resulted in general slowing of mitosis
progression and eventual arrest at late metaphase. The slowing
of mitosis was always observed in eggs developing in low pH
buffers, but the amount of retardation varied with the batches of
eggs used. Other than this, the slowing of mitosis has a direct
correlation with the pH of the medium. This was demonstrated in
an experiment where the same batch of eggs were resuspended in
buffers of pH 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and 7.0, along with the control which
remained in normal sea water. The lower the pH, the slower the
eggs progressed in mitosis; eventually all reached metaphase
