INTRODUCTTON
The determination of metal concentrations in marine organ-
isms is becoming increasingly nécessary for ecological study
due to interactions of essential trace metals with toxic heavy
metals. The significance of trace metals in the marine biosphere
was documented many years ago (CORNEC, 1919; CLAPKE ARD WHEELER,
1922), and research in this field has flourished with the improv-
ment of analytical methods. Reviews by VINCGRALOV (1953) and
COLDBERG (1967) demonstrate increasing importance of heavy metals
in the marine environment.
The accelerated research in heavy metal analysis has led
to greater knowledge of the elemental levels in several marine
organisms (PROOKS AND RUNSBY, 1965; CULKIN AND RILEY, 1958;
—
BERTINE AND GOLDBERG, 1971; GRAHAN, 1972). However, the marine
environment being extremely complex, diverse, and in constant
flux, comparatively few organisms have been analyzed for their
elemental content.
The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the levels
of Ag, Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, and
Zn in the herbivorous gastropod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Olivella biplicata : Exact'>Olivella biplicata</span> (SOWERBY,
1925), the predatory gastropod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polinices lewisii : Exact'>Polinices lewisii</span> (GOULD, 1847),
and the predatory starfish <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pisaster brevispinus : Exact'>Pisaster brevispinus</span> (STIMPSON, 1857)

(these latter two species prey upon <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Olivella : Exact'>Olivella</span> (see EDMARDS, 1969));
2) to clarify the relationship of metals between the two trophic
levels; 3) to define the range and variability of metal con-
centrations within the same species with respect to geographic
location, and 4) to determine the difference in elemental con¬
centrations between certain tissues.

METHOD.
—
Olivella, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polinices : Exact'>Polinices,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pisaster : Exact'>Pisaster</span> were collected subtidally
on sandy beaches (Figure 1) and placed in plastic bags. In the
laboratory, the animals were placed in filtered sea-water
aquaria and allowed to purge themselves of sediments for a
minimum of twenty-four hours. The gastropods were boiled in
distilled water for three to five minutes. This procedure
allowed the soft parts to be easily separated from the shells
with a plastic fork or stainless steel forceps. Both the shell
and soft tissue were oven dried at 65 degrees Centigrade for a
minimum of forty-eight hours.
he starfish were dissected with stainless steel scissors
immediately after purging in sea-water. Part of one ray (not
including hepatic caecum or gonads), hepatic caecum, gonadal
tissue, and a combination of the pyloric stomach, cardiac stomach
and rectal caeca were dissected, placed in tared beakers, and
oven dried.
When dry, the soft parts were ground to a fine powder with
morter and pestle. The Pisaster ray homogenate contained
particles of about 0.5 centimeters across or smaller. The
gastropod shells were not ground. The Polinices shells were
separated into four parts: operculum, anterior, posterior,
and spire. The Olivella shells were digested whole.
Aliquots were weighed into tared beakers and digested with
70% or 90% nitric acid. Shells were digested with concentrated
hydrochloric acid. The samples were left at room temperature
Stanford Schwimer: Page 4
for one hour, refluxed for one hour, and evaporated to 5 ml.
Two to three milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide added drop¬
wise oxidized any remaining organic matter. One milliliter of
hydrochloric acid was added and'the samples were adjusted to
a final dilution (1%) with distilled water.
The samples were analyzed by atomic absorption. Reagent
blanks were run with each group of samples. Readings of less
than 2% absorption were discarded due to probable background
effects.
Means and 95% confidence intervals were determined using
the expression t VX/N, where Vx/N is the standard error of
the mean for NX30, and t is the Student's t value for N-1
degrees of freedom (ELLIOTT, 1971).


LESULPS AND DISCUSSION
Means and 95% confidence intervals for Olivella, Polinices,
and Pisaster soft and hard parts are listed in Table 1. Con-
centrations of aluminum, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese,
nickel, silver, and zinc for Olivella and Polinices soft parts,
and selected Pisaster tissues from different localities are
presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The results
are discussed individually for each element with respect to
geographical location, trophic level, and physiological parts.
Ba, Ca, k, Mg, Na, and Sr values are not discussed but are listed
in Table 1. All elemental values are expressed as Ag/g (ppm)
and ppm is used throughout the text.
Stanford Schwimer: Page 5
Aluminum:
Polinices had highest levels at Fisherman's Wharf (50.6 +
7.5 ppm) and Olivella had highest values at Elkhorn Slough
(Os.5 + 12.3 ppm) and lowest at Monterey Outfall (59.6 + 19.2
ppm). These values are similar to the 50 ppm level described
by VINCGRADOV (1953). The high values of Olivella at Elkhorn
Slough are probably due to the greater amount of clay particles
in suspension in this area.
Cadmium:
Y (1956) found cadmium levels in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mollusca : Exact'>Mollusca</span>
EULLIN AND RILE
of 3 ppm, and levels in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Echinodermata : Exact'>Echinodermata</span> of 1 ppm. Results indi¬
cate that these levels are consistent with Olivella (2.3 + 1.9
ppm -- 4.2 + 5.1 ppm) and Polinices (0.3 + 0.5 ppm -- 1.6 f
1.3 ppm). GRAHAM (1972) found cadmium levels in the gastropod
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula funebralis : Exact'>Tegula funebralis</span> (ADANS, 1854) at Fisherman's Wharf of 2.2
ppm. Pisaster hepatic caecum was found to have high Cd levels
(46.3 + 20.6 ppm) at the Monterey Outfall.
Cadmium is a known contaminant (NILSSON, 1970). Besides
being a general cytotoxic agent, cadmium competes with zinc and
copper for the same binding sites. Zinc and cadmium occur
synergistically in nature; these two elements are likely iso-
morphic in metallothionein (PASSOW, 1969).
Copper:
Levels of 4 ppm to 50 ppm (VINCGRADCV, 1953) are much
higher than copper levels in sea-water, 3 x 10-3 g/1 (GOLDBERG,
Stanford Schwimer: Page 6
1963), yet much lower than copper levels observed in experimental
animals. Fisherman's Wharf had the highest values of copper:
Olivella - 177.3 + 16.5 ppm; Polinices - 115.4 + 11.3 ppm.
GRAILIM (1972) and FITZ (1971) found copper concentrations at
Fisherman's Wharf in Tegula funebralis and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Emerita analoga : Exact'>Emerita analoga</span>
(STIMPSON, 1857) to be 175 + 9.C ppm and 71 - 90 ppm, respectively.
Pisaster had higher copper levels at Fisherman's Wharf than at
the Monterey Sewage Outfall. It is not known why these levels
are highest at the Wharf. Perhaps high copper values are re¬
lated to pollution from boats.
Copper, a highly electronegative metal, is classified as
a metallo-enzyme (BOWEN, 1966). This high electronegative quality
may act to destroy or deactivate enzymes. ADELSTEIN AND VALLEE
(1962) and UNDERWCOD (1971) cited that haemocyanin, an important
copper containing respiratory pigment in various gastropods
and other marine species, was a constituent in blood plasma.
On this basis one would expect to find this element concentrated
in gastropod soft parts.
Iron:
Olivella had the lowest iron levels (358 + 47 ppm) at the
Monterey Sewage Outfall, while Polinices levels remained equal
at both localities. These values, although lowest, are still
above the 200 ppm level for Mollusca and 300 ppm level for

<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Echinodermata : PartialExact'>Echinodermata specified</span> by VINOGRADOV (1953). CULLIN AND RILEI
1758) and Lit¬
(1958) show that <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Littorina littorea : Exact'>Littorina littorea</span> (LINNAEUS, 17
(171
torina littoralis (LINNAEUS, 1758), gastropods from the Irish
Sea, to have values within VINCGRADOV'S limits, 171 ppm and
Stanford Schwimer: Page 7
229 ppm, respectively.
Gastropod shells were found to be highest in iron at the
Fisherman's Wharf site. Olivella shells had mean values of 74.6
C.2 ppm, while anterior parts of the Polinices shell had a
value of 81.1 + 22.4 ppm. <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pisaster : PartialExact'>Pisaster data</span> suggested that the soft
parts were concentrating more iron at the Outfall, while the
ray was higher at Fisherman's Wharf. Iron is found in high
concentrations in clay, and so the high values may be natural
levels. The high values at Fisherman's Wharf could, however,
be attributed to the iron structures located there.
Iron, like many other elements, is essential for life.
As a metal-activated enzyme, iron is able to activate many oxi¬
dases involving molecular oxygen. However, iron is more common-
ly considered a metallo-enzyme, because it is more firmly bound
to a protein in constant stoichiometric ratios rather than
loosely held. One such metalloprotein, echinochrome, is found
in Echinoderm blood (CANNAN, 1927).
Lead:
Levels of lead were found to be greatest for Olivella at
Fisherman's Wharf (8.2 + 3.6 ppm) and Polinices (5.0 + 2.4 ppm)
soft parts. GRAHAM (1972) found the gastropod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Thais emarginata : Exact'>Thais emarginata</span>

(DESHAYES, 1839) to have levels of 9.8 + 4.0 ppm in lead at
Fisherman's Wharf. Olivella shells were lowest at the Wharf,
with highest values at Elkhorn Slough. Polinices shells also had
highest concentrations at Elkhorn Slough. Pisaster tended to
concentrate lead in the rays, Fisherman's Wharf being higher
than Monterey Outfall (30.9 + 4.3 ppm and 15.9 + 4.2 ppm,
Stanford Schwimer: Page 8
respectively). These high values for the shells and Pisaster
rays may be due to light scatter.
BOWEN (1966) classified lead as a very high potential
pollutant. Lead occurs chiefly as a contaminant, and can pro¬
duce toxic effects by combining with cellular membranes to altei
permeability (PASSOW, 1969). Cadmium and copper may also pro-
duce toxic effects by acting on membrane permeability (PASSON,
1969). Lead contamination is very high (0.07 - 0.35Ag Pb/ng
sea-water) in the marine environment (PATTEPSON, 1971). Soil
contains 10 ppm (BOWEN, 1966), and stated levels for Mollusca
and Echinodermata are 0.7 ppm and 187 ppm, respectively (VILO-
GRADOV, 1953). The highest input of lead into the biosphere
is mostly due to automobile exhaust emission.
kanganese:
Manganese has been reported at 60 ppm in Echinodermata and
10 ppm in Mollusca (VINCGRADOV, 1953). Polinices was found to
have the highest concentration of Mn at Elkhorn Slough (27.5 +
5.5 ppm), while levels in Olivella soft parts remained consistant,
as did levels in rays of Pisaster. Manganese levels in Pisaster
soft parts were very low (non-detectable —- 3.0 + 1.4 ppm).
Manganese is another element that is essential for life.
It is considered a metal-activated enzyme (VALLEE, 1955), and was
found to activate certain phosphate transferases and decarboxyl-
ases (BOWEN, 1966). Organically bound Mn is found in Mollusca

(VINCUMADEV, 1953), one of these proteins being pinnaglobin
(ECERI, 1963).
Stanford Schwimer: Page 9
Nickel:
Olivella bodies had highest concentrations at Fisherman's
Wharf (1.8 + 1.7 ppm), and Polinices was highest (1.9 + 1.5 ppm)
at Elkhorn Slough. These values compare with 4 ppm for Mollusca
(VINOGRADOV, 1953). Olivella shells were much higher than the
soft parts (16.9 + 2.9 ppm), and the same is true for Polinices
shells (16.2 + 8.4 ppm). Pisaster rays were found to have
higher concentrations than other tissues, however, these high
values may be due to light scattering caused by the large amounts
of calcium in the samples. Nickel affects several enzymes in
vitro- activation of arginase, carboxylase, trypsin, citritase,
and inhibition of acid phospotase- but is not necessary for
proper functioning.
Silver:
VINOGRADOV (1953) stated Mollusca levels as O ppm, and Echin-
odermata levels as 3? ppm. Since sea-water contains only 3x

10-44g/1 (GOLLBERG, 1963), these relative low levels are quite
high enrichment factors. Olivella bodies were found to be much
higher at Monterey Outfall than any other area (10.7 + 4.8 ppm).
The rays of Pisaster contained equal concentrations and were
higher than any other tissue. This high value in the rays may
be due to scatter. VEITH (1971) reported effluent levels of
many metals from the Monterey Sewage Cutfall, silver having a
concentration in the effluent of 25 ppm. This high input directly
into the biosphere could possibly explain the high Olivella values.
ffinity for
Silver, an electronegative metal, has a strong
imino, amino, and sulphydryl groups (ECWEN, 1966). These groups
Stanford Schwimer: Page 10
are most likely reactive sites on many enzymes, and hence silver
has the capacity to deactivate the enzyme. It follows that
silver is therefore a poison, by virtue of its reactivity with
proteins, especially enzymes. Silver competes with copper,
but probably does not inhibit the copper enzyme (CHRISTIAN ARD
FELDMIN, 1970).
Zinc:
Polinices soft parts had highest concentrations at Elkhorn
Slough (288 + 18 ppm) and Olivella bodies were highest at
Fisherman's Wharf (127 + 14 ppm). GRAHAM (1972) found zinc
levels in Tegula funebralis to be 198 + 7 ppm. These values
all correspond with those in VINCGRADOV (1953) of 200 ppm for
Mollusca and 25 ppm for Echinodermata. Pisaster displays an
interesting pattern as to zinc concentration. The Wharf site
was higher in all tissues except for the gonads. At the Outfall,
the gonads were excessively high, with values averaging 511.9
+ 28.1 ppm. Echinoderm gonads are known to contain high zinc
levels (personal correspondence, MARTIN). Those Pisaster collected
at the Outfall had less developed gonads than those from Fisher-
man's Wharf. This may be the reason why specimens from these
two localities differed in Zn concentrations. Another possibility
could be the high zinc effluent from the Monterey Outfall of
820 ppm (YEITH, 1971).
Zinc, a metallo-enzyme, is essential to most life forms
(EOWEN, 1966). Zinc can displace copper from a protein, and
hence act as an antagonist, or can compete in some proteins with
Stanford Schwimer: Page 11
cadmium for binding sites.
Trophic Magnification:
Much attention has been given to the problems of biological
magnification of DDT, DDE, PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls),
and other halogenated hydrocarbon concentrations (WOCDWELL,
1967; JOHNSON, et al, 1971; NIMTO, et al, 1971). Upon analy-
sis of Table 1, it seems evident that heavy metals do not con-
centrate through the trophic levels of the organisms studied.
SUMMARY
Although concentrations of heavy and trace metals are not
magnified through the studied trophic levels, this possiblity
may still exist. This is suggested from the high elemental levels
observed at Fisherman's Wharf (Cu and Pb), Monterey Sewage
Outfall (Ag, Cd, and Zn), and Elkhorn Slough (Fe). These
high values, possible consequences of pollution, should not
go unchecked. Much study is still needed as to toxicity, base
levels, and the possible biological magnification of heavy
and trace metals.
