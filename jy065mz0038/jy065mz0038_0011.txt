LABORATORY STUDIES
Fresh Acanthina punctulata and barnacles (Chthamalus
spp.) were gathered from the field before each experiment.
To test the response of Chthamalus to two known choline esters,
(benzoyl chloride and conbachol), a solution of 1 mg of choline
ester per l ml of sea water was used. Hypobranchial gland ex¬
tracts used consisted of 4 hypobranchial glands macerated in
50 ml of sea water. A whitish-green mucus was often secreted
from the hypobranchial gland when disturbed during dissections;
this mucus was added to the hypobranchial gland extracts. The
experimental control consisted of other tissue from the roof
of the mantle cavity, in approximately the same mass as 4 hypo¬
branchial glands, ground up in 50 ml of sea water. Injections
into barnacles consisted of 0.2 ml of extract; they were made
with a fine needle and a 1 ml syringe. When I injected the
solution in the tops of the barnacles, I waited until they opened
to feed and then gently touched the needle inside the mantle
cavity. For injections at the side of the operculum, I in¬
jected through the soft tissue lying between the opercular
plates and the walls of the barnacles.
LABORATORY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Laboratory experiments showed that when barnacles were in¬
jected through opercular plates with solutions of known choline
esters, paralysis occured within minutes after which the barnacle
responded slowly or not at all to probing. The toxin was long
acting, lasting anywhere from 3 to 24 hours. A group of control
barnacles, injected with seawater through the opercular plates,
