and the soft parts of the barnacle are consumed." MacGinitie
and MacGinitie (1968) make the same general observation. My
own observations, while incomplete, also indicate that Acan¬
thina punctulata uses its spine to help it feed on barnacles.
Four times, twice in the laboratory and twice in the field,
I have observed the use of the spine over the top of a barnacle.
Both times in the field, the action occured when the snail was
awash on an incoming tide. The Acanthina crawled upon a Chtha¬
malus, sat there for a minute or so with no apparent motion.
Then the Acanthina raised the anterior portion of its shell (its
foot still firmly on the side of the barnacle), and in a ham¬
mering motion, brought it down on top of the opercular scutes
of the barnacle. It then lifted its shell and repeated the
same motion. I was not able to see whether the spine was actually
separating the scutes and entering the mantle cavity of the bar¬
nacle. Nevertheless, once the spine was over the operculum
opening, it stayed in this position for approximately 2 minutes.
After this time period, the snail took its spine off the bar¬
nacle and settled over the prey in a feeding position. I let the
snail stay on the barnacle for 15 minutes, after which time I
lifted it up to reveal the proboscis everted between the opercular
openings. When the Acanthina was removed from the prey, the bar¬
nacle was left gaping open as if it were somehow paralyzed.
The same general behavior was observed in the labratory.
However, when the Acanthina lifted its shell up and gave the
hammering blow with its spine, it thrust the spine between the
