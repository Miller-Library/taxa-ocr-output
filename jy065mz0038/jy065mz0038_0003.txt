extended. With regard to condition of emersion, animals were
classified as dry (totally exposed above water), awash (water
was washing back and forth over the snail), or submerged (tot¬
ally under water). At low tide, numerous Acanthina were found in
Anthopleura elegantissima beds, or submerged in tidepools. A
snail in a tidepool that was being washed by the incoming
tide was still counted as being in a tidepool. In determining
feeding activity, I did not distinguish between drilling and
eating. An Acanthina on a prey species (e.g., another snail),
with a drill hole just beneath it, was counted as feeding. When
the prey consisted of barnacles, (e.g., Chthamalus spp., Balanus
glandula), feeding activity was harder to determine. If a snail
was poised over one barnacle and looked as though it could be
feeding, I carefully lifted the anterior portion of the snail
up to see if I could actually see the proboscis withdrawn from
the barnacle. Often I could. If I couldn't actually see the
proboscis withdrawn yet the barnacle underneath was gaping open,
I counted the snail as feeding. When any uncertainty existed, the
snails were counted as not feeding. If the snail was feeding, the
prey was marked with a small dot of fingernail polish so a de¬
termination could be made at a later time whether the snail was
feeding on old or newly caught prey.
Supplementary observations on feeding and movement were
obtained at eight high tides and eight low tides.
