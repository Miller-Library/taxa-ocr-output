Figure 1: Vertical distribution of the population of Acanthina
punctulata in a 15 by 20 meter rectangular study area at
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California.
Figure 2: Distribution of the population of Acanthina pun¬
ctulata on different types of surfaces in the study site.
Figure 3: Movement and feeding of 60 Acanthina punctulata
over a 25 hour tidal cycle.
Figure 4: Relation of number of new prey caught by Acanthina
punctulata to tidal height over a 25 hour period.
Figure 5: Summary of field observations during 8 high and 8
low tides. Lower portions of the graph indicate the number of
individuals of Acanthina punctulata observed for high and low
tides, and the conditions of emmersion or exposure. Top por¬
tions of the graph show the number of these individuals moving
or feeding for a given condition of the tide.
Figure 6: Feeding preferences of 70 Acanthina punctulata found
feeding in the field at the Mussel Point study site. Relative
abundances of prey species were subjectively determined on a
scale of 0 to 4 (0-none, 4-very abundant).

dalli to 0.2 ml injections of hypobranchial gland or control
