at low tide, crawl up onto the rocks and barnacles now washed
or covered by the incoming tide. The lower portion of Figure 3
shows that as the tide rises, the number of snails high on
rocks and barnacles 4.5 feet or more above mean lower low water
also rises, and then lowers again as the tide goes down. Figure
3 also shows that at low tide, when a majority of the snails are
in an exposed condition, there is little movement. Of the snails
moving during periods of low tide, almost all are awash or sub¬
merged. As the tide rises and more snails become awash or sub¬
merged, the number moving increases. This relation can be seen
across the 25 hour tidal cycle. Feeding occurs according to the
same pattern. The number of snails seen feeding increases as
the tide rises, and decreases as the tide falls. Interestingly,
of those snails feeding at low tide, a large proportion of them
are feeding on prey caught during the previous high tide, in¬
dicating that hunting occurs at high tide. This is shown more
clearly in Figure 4, depicting the number of new prey caught as
a function of tical height during the 25 hour study. A regression
line for the data points has a slope of .9 and a p-value less
than .Ol, showing that the number of new prey caught increases
significantly as the water level rises.
Supplementary data on feeding and movement, appearing in
Figure 5, show more movement and feeding at high tide than at
low tide; of the snails moving and feeding, most were either
awash or submerged.
My data show clearly there is a marked increase in activity
and feeding as the Acanthina punctulata population becomes awashed
or submerged by the incoming tide. This phenomenon was reporte
