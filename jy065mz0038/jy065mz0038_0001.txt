Acanthina punctulata (Sowerby, 1825) is a common predatory
prosobranch gastropod in the upper intertidal zone at Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California. It is very similar to Acan¬
thina spirata (Blainville, 1832), and the question of whether
the two forms represent distinct species is still open. Pre¬
vious work on both snails has been reviewed by Abbott and Haderlie
(1979). The main previous study of food and foraging in Acan¬
thina punctulata, by Menge (1974), was carried out at Santa
Cruz Island, off Santa Barbara. Systematic studies of its dis¬
tribution, diet, activity patterns, and predatory activity in
the Monterey Bay area, the nothern limit of its known geograph¬
ical range, are needed. This paper is a preliminary investigation
into these aspects. The function of the strange tooth on the
lip of the aperture of Acanthina's shell has long puzzled in¬
vestigators. Hewatt (1934) gave a detailed account of its use
to prevent closure of the operculum in barnacles, but other in¬
vestigators have not confirmed this. This paper presents my ob¬
servations on the use of the tooth in the predatory activity of
Acanthina punctulata.
Studies were carried out on Mussel Point, close to the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University. The study site
was an area 20 by 15 meters located in a relatively protected
place that was accessible at high tide. Bare rocks and rocks
bearing barnacles were prevelant in the study site; tidepools
and crevices, and beds of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegant¬
issima (Brandt,1835) existed amongst these rocks. Vertical position
