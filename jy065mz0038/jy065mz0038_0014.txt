mantle cavity and drip out near the spine. The spine may be
used to pry open or to hold open the scutes (or the corresÂ¬
ponding mantle flap lip) of the barnacle as poison is dripped
in, or it may be used as an applicator, applying the toxin to
the soft tissues or to the operculum opening of the barnacle,
The barnacles Chthamalus spp. and Balanus glandula pro-
vide relatively small amounts of food to a predator. From this
point of view, it would seem desirable for the gastropods to
have developed a relatively fast and effortless alternative
to drilling as a means for opening barnacles. The absence of
drill marks, and the obvious paralysis of the prey, and the
experiments performed, all suggest that Acanthina does have
such a means, and that it involves the hypobranchial gland and
the spine.
SUMMARY
1) Vertical distribution of Acanthina punctulata near
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, ranges
from 2 to 5 feet above MLLW, with the majority of snails in
the Gigartina papillata - Endocladia muricata zone, 2.5 to 4
feet above O tide mark.
Near Hopkins Marine Station, Acanthina punctulata were
distributed on 4 major substrates; rocks bearing barnacles,
sandy bottomed tidepools, in and among A. elegantissima beds
