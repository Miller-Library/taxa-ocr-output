the columella (Menge, 1974). My studies indicate that consum¬
ption of an individual snail takes anywhere from 2 hours to a
day depending on the size of the prey. Observations of Acanthina
feeding on meat removed from Littorina planaxis and placed in
a deep glass vial provided a good view of the extended pro¬
boscis. The proboscis is semi-transparent and the odontaphore,
radular sac, and esophageal tube could be distinguished. Meat
is detached from the prey in relatively large chunks and passed
rapidly along the esophagus.
A special attempt was made to observe the use of the mar¬
ginal spine of Acanthina punctulata. Paine (1966) studied sev-
eral species of Acanthina and reported no use for the tooth ex¬
cept perhaps as a brace or wedge when drilling through prey.
I have often seen the tooth wedged up against the inside lip of
the prey's operculum when Acanthina is drilling the shell of
another snail. Hewatt (1934) describes another use of the spine
in preying on barnacles. He says, "When attacking a barnacle,
the snail assumes a position above the opening of the barnacle
shell so that this spine is directly above the line of contact
of the closed scutes of the barnacle. The Acanthina usually takes
this position when the tide is out and the barnacle thus is
closed. When the water returns over the area, the natural re¬
action of the barnacle is to open up and begin the feeding act¬
ivities. As soon as this occurs, the snail quickly inserts its
spine into the opening between the scutes, the proboscis everted,
