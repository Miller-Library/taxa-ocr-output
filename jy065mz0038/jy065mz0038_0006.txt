by Glynn (1965) who states that at high water, more Acanthina
move up into the Endocladia-Balanus belt and commence to feed. J.L.
Menge (1974) in her study on the prey selection and foraging
activities of Acanthina punctulata at Santa Cruz Island, found
that the population there forages at low tide but sometimes
continues to feed over the high tide. It seems possible this
discrepancy could be explained by differences in physical nature
of the respective study sites. If Menge's site experienced more
wave action than my protected locality, this might have re¬
stricted foraging at high tide.
Figure 6 shows the diet of the Acanthina population in
relation to the relative abundance of the prey. The abundant
barnacles Chthamalus spp. and Balanus glandula, were consumed
most frequently. Unlike the Santa Cruz Island population re¬
ported by Menge (1974), a surprisingly large number of Acanthina
at Pacific Grove were found feeding on Tegula funebralis (A.
Adams, 1885), which were also abundant in the field. Most of
these captures occured near tidepools. Two smaller gastropods,
Littorina scutulata (Gould,1849) and Littorina planaxis (Philippi,
1847), were also consumed readily in the field. Littorina planaxis
normally exists in a zone above the Acanthina population; usually
the individuals preyed upon are those knocked down by wave action
into the zone of Acanthina. Its interesting to note that while
the limpets Collisella digitalis (Rathke, 1833), and Collisella
scabra (Gould,1846), were both very abundant in the study area,
none were observed being preyed upon. Acanthina in laboratory
