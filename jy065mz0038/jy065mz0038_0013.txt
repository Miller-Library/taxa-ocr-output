affect on barnacles.) Laboratory observations support this
hyphothesis. Often, after removing a feeding Acanthina from
a gaping barnacle, no bore holes or other indications of
physical damage could be observed around the opercular plates.
To substantiate this observation, 10 Acanthina (with spines on)
were placed in an aquaria with rocks and Chthamalus spp..10
other Acanthina with spines filed off were placed in an iden¬
tical environment. Qualitative observations a day later showed
the snails without their spines caused more damage to the bar¬
nacles than the control snails. Several barnacles being preyed
upon by spineless Acanthina showed damaged opercular plates
and possible indications of bore holes next to the opercular
opening. Damage to this extent was not seen on the control
barnacles being preyed upon by normal Acanthina. These ob¬
servations suggest that the spine is used in some way for a
more efficient predatory encounter with barnacles.
Looking at the anatomy of Acanthina, some observations
can be made as to how the spine might be related to the
poison secreted by the hypobranchial gland. Near the siphon
on the lip of the mantle fold, is a slightly protruding tongue
of tissue corresponding in position to the spine. This slight
protrusion is located near the anterior end of the hypobranchial
gland. Although no ciliary tract was found connecting the hypo¬
branchial gland with the spine area, it is possible that a
hypobranchial gland secretion could flow over the top of the
