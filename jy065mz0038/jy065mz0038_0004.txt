SULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results of the distribution studies are shown in
figures 1 and 2. In vertical distribution at low tide, (Fig¬
ure 1), the snails occured 2 to 5 feet above mean lower low
water (MLLW), with the majority at 2.5 to 4 feet in a zone
including some red algae (Gigartina papillata (J. Aghardi 1848),
and some Endocladia muricata (J. Aghardi 1847)). The snails
found at the 2 foot level were down among tidepools and the
ones found at 5 feet were high upon bare rocks covered with
scattered barnacles.
Figure 2 shows the types of substrata upon which Acan¬
thina punctulata were found. For example, of the total area
of 50 square meters examined, 49% was covered either with bare
rock or rock bearing Chthamalus or Balanus. A correspondingly
large number (105) of Acanthina appeared on this substrate. The
sandy bottoms of tidepools accounted for approximately 23% of
the total area sampled and a large number (89) of Acanthina
were found on this substrate. It is interesting to note that
while Anthopleura elegantissima beds accounted for only 3% of
the total area sampled, a comparatively large number of Acan¬
thina were present among the beds.
Figure 3 shows the activity of the Acanthina population
over a 25 hour tidal cycle. Under conditions of low tide, many
snails are exposed and dry. As the tide rises, these snails be¬
come awash or submerged by the incoming water. Snails which are
in the moist environments of A. elegantissima beds and tidepools
