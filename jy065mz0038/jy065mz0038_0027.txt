extract. Hypobranchial extract injections were given through
the opercular openings in 14 barnacles, and in the soft tissue
between the opercular and wall plates in 6 barnacles. Response
was determined on a scale of O to 5 (healthy to dead). Among
barnacles injected with hypobranchial extract through the o¬
percular plates, individuals 11 through 14 showed identical
responses of 4 (very sick) over the 24 hour tidal period. Con¬
trol individuals 1 through 6 had healthy responses over 24 hours.
