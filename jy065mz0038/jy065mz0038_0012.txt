showed no paralysis.
When a seawater solution of hypobranchial gland extract
was injected through the opercular plates of barnacles, a
paralyzing response was observed much like that noted for the
injections of choline esters. The results are, summerized in
Figure 7. The response of barnacles are observed at specified
intervals over a period of 24 hours. The barnacles' responses
to probing were graded on a scale of 0 to 5 (0-full, healthy
response, l-tight closure of opercular scutes but no clamping
down, 2-slow closure - couldn't close tightly, 3-very slow
closure - couldn't close at all, 4-no response at all to probing,
5=death - determined after 24 hours of no response). Individual
barnacles tested are listed along the Y-axis. Note that 4 in¬
dividuals (numbers 11 - 14) receiving the hypobranchial inject¬
ion through the top of the opercular plates had identical re¬
sponses. Six of the eight control barnacles (numbers 1 - 6) had
the same healthy response (graded 0). Qualitatively, the amount
of black shown in Figure 7 corresponds to the degree of paralysis
observed in a barnacle. Note the apparent recovery of paralyzed
barnacles around 4 to 6 hours after injection of hypobranchial
gland extract.
The results shown in Figure 7 suggest that Acanthina pun¬
ctulata could be using a toxic secretion of some sort from the
hypobranchial gland to paralyze the barnacles they prey upon.
(A toxin from the salivary glands is not excluded, but some
preliminary tests of salivery gland extracts showed no toxic
