wall plates and the opercular plates of the barnacle. It re¬
peated this motion twice (the first time, the spine didn't
reach the opercular opening and slid down the side of the bar¬
nacle). The snail stayed in this position for 2.5 minutes, and
then took its spine out and settled over the barnacle as if to
feed. At this point, I lifted the snail off; the barnacle was
not gaping, and it gave a fast closing response when touched
with a probe. After 45 minutes the barnacle still showed no signs
of gaping. I replaced the snail near the barnacle. Almost im¬
mediately it moved over the barnacle in a feeding position, the
anterior portion of the snail directly over the opercular plates
of the barnacle; I could see its proboscis slowly retract from
the gaping opercular plates. When the gaping barnacle was
touched with a probe, the operculum slowly closed but not totally.
I could see no damage to the plates and there was no bore hole
present.
My observations suggest the hypothesis that when preying
upon barnacles, Acanthina punctulata uses some sort of fast
acting toxin, and that the spine in some way helps the predator
to inject or apply this toxin into the mantle cavity of the bar¬
nacle, causing paralysis.
Toxic choline esters have previously been reported from the
hypobranchial gland of Acanthina spirata (Bender, DeRiemer et.al.,
1974; the species actually studied was probably Acanthina pun¬
ctulata) could be using choline esters from its hypobranchial
gland as a poison to paralyze barnacles.
