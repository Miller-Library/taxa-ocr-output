FIELD STUDIES OF DISTRIBUTION, ACTIVITY PATTERNS, AND DIE
Field studies were made in the period May 1 to June 1,
1979. Snails used for observations of distribution, activity
patterns and feeding were selected at coordinate points in the
study site generated by random numbers. When a snail was seen
feeding, a 10 cm radius circle was placed around it and the
relative abundance of different prey was subjectively determined
on a scale of 0 to 4 (0-none, 4=very abundant).
To study the distribution of Acanthina punctulata on var-
ious substrata, 50 quadrats, each 1 m, were selected in the
study area at coordinates picked by use of a random number gen¬
erator. Within each meter squared plot, the percent of the total
area represented by each type of substrate was measured with an
accuracy of about + 5%, and the 50 plots were then averaged to¬
gether to yield the percent of each type of substrate for the
total area.
For a study of activity, 60 Acanthina punctulata in the
20 by 15 meter study site were selected by a random number coor¬
dinate point method. They were marked with red fingernail polish
and followed over a 25 hour tidal cycle. Observations were made
every 2 hours, of movement, feeding, and condition of emersion
of each snail. A snail was classified as moving if over a 30
second time period it could be seen crawling with its tentacles
