3) Activity and feeding of Acanthina punctulata at Mussel
Point corresponds to a tidal cycle. At low tide, under con¬
ditions of exposure, Acanthina seeks the moisture of tidepools
and A. elegantissima beds and remains relatively motionless.
As the tide rises, activity increases and the snails crawl up
onto the rocks and barnacles now washed or covered by the in¬
coming tide. Feeding occurs according to the same pattern. The
number of snails seen feeding increases as the tide rises and
decreases and the tide falls. Of those snails feeding at low
tide, a large proportion of them are feeding on prey caught
during the previous high tide.
4) The field diet of Acanthina punctulata at Mussel Point
includes the barnacles, Chthamalus spp. and Balanus glandula
and the gastropods, Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata
and Tegula funebralis.
5) Both field and laboratory observations on Acanthina
punctulata indicate a hammering action of its tooth on the
opercular opening of their barnacle prey. The obvious paralysis
of the barnacle coupled with the absence of drill marks sug¬
gest the secretion of some sort of toxin through the barnacle's
opercular opening. Hypobranchial gland extract has been found
to have this same paralyzing affect when applied to the soft
tissues or to the opercular openings of Chthamalus dalli. The
spine may be used to pry open or to hold open the scutes (or the
corresponding mantle flap lip) of the barnacle as poison is
