aquaria showed the same general preferences as in the field, but
in the labratory they selected a wider varity of prey items
including the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby,
1883), the limpets Collisella digitalis and Collisella scabra,
and the bivalve Mytilus californianus (Conrad,1837).
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR
When observed in lab, Acanthina punctulata approaches
potential prey with cephalic tentacles extended, swinging its
shell to the left and right on its longitudal axis as it moves
along. The orientation of the shell often places the marginal
tooth directly in front of the snail, and cephalic tentacles
can often be seen extending out from either side of the tooth.
When an Acanthina contacts another snail as prey, it
usually contacts the prey first with its tentacles. The predator
then places the anterior portion of its foot upon the prey and
starts to mount it, as if trying to pull the prey off the subÂ¬
stratum. This behavior was also noted by Bigler (1964) and Menge
(1974). Once the prey is positioned underneath the foot of the
Acanthina, drilling commences. Drilling involves a secretion
from the Acessory Boring Organ (ABO) located in the propodium,
which somehow dissolves or softens the shell of the prey; drilling
then involves mechanical rasping by the radula of the softened
portion of the prey's shell (Hemingway, 1973). Most snail
prey are drilled at the same place, the thickest part of the
shell outside the area where the columellar muscle attaches to
