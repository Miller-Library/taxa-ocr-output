Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
sized female sea otter (20 kg) requires about 6000 kilocalories per day. This
typically corresponds to 20-25% of its weight, daily (Costa 1978, Östfeld, 1982).
For this reason, otters spend approximately 25% of their time foraging, with the
rest of their time divided between resting (-60%) and grooming (-15%).
There are three peak times of foraging activity per day. One peak occurs
in the early morning, the second at late afternoon, and the third peak happens
around midnight. (Shimek and Monk, 1977, Loughlin, 1977). The extent of the
foraging activity throughout the night is currently under debate, since there is
such difficulty in making nighttime observations.
The California sea otter's diet consists of practically any macro¬
invertebrate that can be found near the coast. Ötters feed on species ranging
from turban snails, clams, sea urchins, and mussels to octopuses, abalone, and
kelp crabs, even eating the occasional fish or sea bird (Riedman and Estes,
1990, 1988a).
The object of this study was to find out to what extent otters feed on the
mussels at Point Cabrillo, Pacific Grove, California. At Point Pedras Blancas,
San Luis Obispo County, California, otters were observed removing mussels in
clumps, creating gaps in the mussel beds. Measurements of the increase in
size of these gaps and the number of new gaps created have been used to
determine the frequency of occurrence of sea otter foraging (VanBlaricom,
1988).
The questions addressed by this study were how the behavior of foraging
on mussels varied among individuals and how increasing wave height affected
