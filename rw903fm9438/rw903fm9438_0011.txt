Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
study. There were three mother-pup pairs in the area around Point Cabrillo.
and two pairs were seen foraging on the mussels beds in the area. Seven of
the 13 females otters that foraged on mussels had nose scars, and two of these
were the mothers with pups; the remaining six otters were assumed to be
juveniles or younger adults. Using Garshelis' (1983) criteria for estimation of
age, only two of these otters were older than six years. Most of the others were
probably under four years of age.
Frequency of success for otters foraging on mussels was significantly
higher than the combined frequency of success of foraging on all other types of
prey (Chi-squared, p««0.001, Table 1). The frequency of success for individual
otters was also examined and was proved to differ significantly (Table 1). The
frequency of success for otters foraging on mussels also varied significantly with
wave, with lowest frequency of success when wave height was highest (Table
1). Next, the ratio of mussels eaten to the number of mussels removed was
examined at varying wave heights, and this ratio decreased significantly as
wave height increased (Table 1). There was no significant difference in the
ratio of the number of mussels removed to the number of mussels eaten among
different individuals. The pooled ratio of mussels eaten to mussels remoyed
was 0.88, and figure 2 shows that ratio of the mean number of mussels removed
and mean number of mussels eaten for seven otters remains fairly consistent.
There were a significant inter-individual differences of both the mean
number of mussels removed and the mean number of mussels eaten (ANOVA,
p«0.001, Table 2). The mean number of mussels removed for the population
