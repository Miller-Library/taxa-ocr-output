Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
across the tour wave height categories was analyzed with a chi squared test.
Methods of statistical analysis were obtained from Sokal and Rohlf (1981).
Single factor analysis of variance (ANÖVA) was used to test for
differences in mean number of mussels removed and mean number of mussels
eaten for different individuals and at different wave height categories, as well as
inter-individual mean dive time. Duration of dive was separated into nine time
categories and the mean number of mussels removed per dive depending on
dive length was compared. Two factor ANÖVA was used to analyze the effects
of time of day and wave height on the mean number of otters foraging on
mussels and the effects of tidal height and wave height on mean number of
otters foraging on mussels. The time of day was grouped into four different
categories: early morning (0600-0959), late morning (1000-1259), afternoon
(1300-1659), and early evening (1700-2059). The number of otters was log¬
transformed flog(x+1)] before analysis.
The test for tidal height was carried out in a similar fashion, with four
groups: low low (g1.49 ft), high low (1.5-2.49 ft), low high (2.5-3.49 ft), and high
high (23.5 ft). The same type of test was run for tidal height as was for time of
day. The data were log-transformed and tested for independent effect and
interaction effect.
