Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
INTRODUCTION
Sea otters are the smallest marine mammal and were once thought to be
extinct in California, due to exhaustive hunting. The population now stands at
approximately 2000 individuals (USFWS/CDFG 1990 census, M. Staedler,
pers. comm.) and ranges south from San Luis Obispo to the northern boundary
of Ano Nuevo Point (Riedman and Estes, 1988). The original distribution
stretched from central Baja to northern Japan (Riedman and Estes, 1988). The
removal from and subsequent reintroduction of sea otters in central California
has had a large effect on the coastal communities they inhabit.
Sea otters live close to shore of areas composed of rocky substrate,
rarely swimming past of the outer limit of the kelp canopy. Occasionally otters
live in sandy bottom areas or are observed more than one kilometer from the
shore (Riedman and Estes, 1988b, 1990). However, rocky substrate supports a
higher density of otters than a soft bottom community does: 5 otters/km2 versus
0.8 otters/km? (California Department of Fish and Game, 1976). Sea otters
spend much of their time in the large kelp forests of Macrocystis pyrifera, either
resting or foraging.
Unlike other marine mammals, sea otters lack blubber. Instead they
have a thick, dense fur, that must be constantly groomed to keep a thin layer of
air trapped inside it for insulation. To reduce the amount of heat lost to the cold
waters off central California, otters maintain a high level of heat production
(Costa and Kooyman, 1982). Because of this high metabolic rate, an average
