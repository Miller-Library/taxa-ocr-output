Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor, Jim Watanabe, who
went above and beyond the call of duty in helping me with this project. I would
also like to thank Teri Nicholson and Emily Carrington in helping me conceive
the idea for this project, and to Teri for walking me through the first few weeks of
observations. Thanks to Nancy Eufemia for making sure none of us fell into the
cracks and making all of our presentations look professional. Special thanks to
Mike Kenner and Dawn Breese of UCSC for loaning a Questar spotting scope
to me. Thanks to Michelle Staedler of the Monterey Bay Aquarium for taking
time out to talk to me and set me on the right track. Thanks to School House
Rock for teaching me how to count, since these skills were definitely put to the
test this quarter. Also, thanks to Bryan Sun for helping with measurements on
the mussel beds. And finally, another large outpouring of gratitude to Jim
Watanabe, for spending countless hours helping me with statistical analysis,
numerous revisions of this paper, and critiquing my presentation at midnight the
night before it was given.
