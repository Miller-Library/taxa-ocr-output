Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
ABSTRACT
Foraging on intertidal mussels by the California sea otter, Enhydra lutris,
was examined to determine its effects on the mussel beds around Point
Cabrillo, Pacific Grove, CA. Frequency of success for foraging on mussels and
foraging on other types of prey were observed, as well as the mean number of
mussels removed and eaten by otters. The average duration of individual
feeding bouts and the average number of dives per minute were measured in
order to discover the mean number of mussels removed a day. These data
were analyzed comparing individual otter eating habits. Frequency of success
for mussel (94.53%) and non-mussel foraging (69.05%) and were significantly
different (p««0.001). There was also significant inter-individual variance in
mean number of mussels removed (p«40.001) and mean number of mussels
eaten (pæ20.001) among different otters. Foraging on mussels in relation to
increasing wave heights showed a significant decrease in number of mussels
removed (p20.005) and mussels eaten (p40.001) as wave height increased.
Success ratio also decreased as wave height increased (p20.01). In addition,
the frequency of foraging on mussel beds increased with tidal height and was
more prevalent in the early evening compared to the other times of the day.
Because otters have such a high metabolic rate, they must eat up to 25%
of their body weight daily. Using previously published data (Costa, 1978),
mean number of mussels per dive, and average number of dives per minute, a
sea otter would have to forage for mussels for approximately 294 minutes per
day to obtain sufficient kilocalories.
