Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
quantifiable aspects of otters' foraging behavior were significantly reduced.
Mean number of mussels removed and mean number eaten decreased, as did
duration of dive. It could be due to sheer wave force, so the otters have to
devote more effort to avoid being smashed into a rock, leaving less effort for
removing mussels. Wave force probably plays a large part in the reduced
frequency of success with increased wave height.
Although VanBlaricom (1988) reported California sea otters swimming
10-20 meters away from the shore after each dive, the otters foraging off Point
Cabrillo did not exhibit this behavior. The otters stayed relatively close to the
shore even at larger wave heights. Also, the ratio of mussels eaten to mussels
removed decreased with increased wave height, and this is most likely due to
an increase in the amount of dropped mussels due to larger waves.
One aspect that did not decrease with increasing wave height was the
mean duration of the foraging bout, which increased slightly with wave height.
Even though this trend was not significant, it makes sense that the otters would
have to forage for a longer period of time in order to eat the same amount of
mussels, since mean number of mussels eaten per dive decreases with
increased wave height.
Using Costa's (1978) numbers for caloric content, considering that an
average female otter weighing 20 kg requires 6000 kilocalories per day, and
using the empirically determined average weight of a mussel, an otter would
have to eat approximately 860 mussels per day if its diet consisted strictly of
mussels. At 0.95 dives per minute and 3.04 mussels eaten per dive, this results
