Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
Identifications of the prey item and individual otter were sometimes difficult,
depending on the distance from shore.
Tidal height estimates were provided by TideMaster» - Zephyr Services,
Pittsburgh, PA. Wave height was obtained from the National Data Buoy Center
Buoy Number 46042, located in the northern Monterey Bay (36.8° N, 122.4° W).
The wave height was recorded for each hour, and then classified into one of
four categories: calm (25.0 ft), mild (5.0-6.9 ft), medium (7.0-8.9 ft), and rough
(29.0 ft).
Marking of individual mussels with fingernail polish was attempted, but
proved unsuccessful as the majority of mussels that the otters were foraging
were below MLLW and did not have sufficient time to dry. The polish stayed on
only about 70% of the mussels, so is was impossible to tell if the mussel had
been removed by an otter, wave force, or if the paint had just worn off.
In order to determine the average caloric value of a mussel, samples
were collected and their length and weight were measured. The wet weight
was then converted to a dry weight, considering that a mussels is approximately
83% water (Peak, 1983). The ratio between the lengths and dry weights
correlated to those found by Salkeld (1995). This dry weigh was then converted
to kilocalories per mussel using the constant 4.66 kcal/g (Costa, 1978).
The following comparisons were made using chi-squared tests: the
frequency of success for mussel versus non-mussel foraging, the frequency of
success for mussel foraging between different otters, and the ratio of mussels
removed and mussels eaten by individual otters. Also, the frequency of success
