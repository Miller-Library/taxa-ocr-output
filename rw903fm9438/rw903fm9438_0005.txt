Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
this behavior. It has been established that sea otters commonly forage on
mussels (Mackey, 1982, VanBlaricom 1988), and the type of otters foraging on
mussels are usually females, mothers with pups, and recently independent
juveniles. The variation in diet of different otters has clearly been demonstrated
(Lyons, 1991), and individuals exhibit sustained preferences for particular prey
(Riedman and Estes, 1990). The variations among individuals foraging on a
single prey species, in this case mussels, has not been examined, so this was
chosen as an area to be explored. Since sea otter predation and wave force
are the two main factors acting on mussel mortality, the effects of waves on sea
otter foraging was chosen as a second factor to investigate.
