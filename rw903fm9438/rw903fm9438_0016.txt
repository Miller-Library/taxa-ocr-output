Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
in a period of foraging of about 290 minutes per day. This is about 20% of the
day spent foraging, which corresponds to previously determined otter activity
budgets. If an otter fed on only red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), then it would
only need to spend 93 minutes a day foraging, and if it fed strictly on kelp crab
(Pugettia producta), then it would take 268 minutes per day (Östfeld, 1982),
However, these two species are not nearly as abundant as Mytilus
californianus. A diet consisting only of mussels would not be energetically
unteasible, but individual otters have prey preferences, and do not feed on any
single species of prey exclusively (Riedman and Estes, 1990, Lyons, 1991).
While watching foraging on mussels and other prey, otters seemed
determined to find one type of prey at a time. The otters at the mussel beds
persisted to eat mussels, even though there were usually several Pisaster in the
same area, they were never observed to eat them. Ötters were commonly
observed to return to the surface with the same species of prey on continuous
subtidal dives.
