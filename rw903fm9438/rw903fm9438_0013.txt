Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
p.m., when it sharply dropped, then increased to a peak at 6:00 p.m., then
decreased again. Foraging activity was significantly greater in early evening
compared to both early and late morning. Foraging activity also decreased
significantly as wave heights increased (Fig. 3b, Table 7) Foraging activity at
medium and rough wave conditions remained low throughout the day, and the
peaks of activity that the overall pattern of foraging show are not present for
foraging on mussels (Fig. 3b).
The number of otters foraging increased significantly with increased tidal
height (Fig 4, Table 7). The average number of otters foraging on mussels was
significantly lower on rough days versus all other categories.
Increased wave height did more than influence the individual foraging
behavior, it also reduced the mean number of total otters foraging per day in the
study site (Fig. 5, Table 8). While otters were observed foraging on mussels at
practically all wave heights, at wave heights above 9 ft, this behavior was short
lived and infrequent. The mean number of otters foraging on mussels per day
drops from 7.8 to 1.25, resulting a large effect of the total number of mussels
removed per day depending on the wave conditions. The numbers of otters
foraging on mussels decreased at all times of day and at all tidal heights as
wave heights increased.
The average wet weight of mussels approximately the same size that
otters forage on was measured to be 8.8 grams. This was converted to a dry
weight of 1.5 g/ mussel. Multiplying by 4.66 kcal/g (Costa, 1978) gives 6.99
kcallmussel.
