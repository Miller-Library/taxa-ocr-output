Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
DISCUSSION
Foraging activity on all types of prey peaks at 7:00 a.m. and at 5:00 p.m.,
separated by a sharp decrease in activity at noon (Shimek and Monk, 1977).
Only one peak at 6:00 p.m. was observed for foraging on mussels. The number
of otters foraging on mussels increased slightly from 6:00 am to 3:00 p.m., with
no noticeable times of increased or decreased activity. Garshelis (1983)
observed substantially higher levels of activity from 8:00 am to 4:00 p.m. in an
area high in both consumption of mussels by otters and in number of mother
and pup pairs. He hypothesized that the majority of the otters foraging on
mussels at off peak times are doing so to avoid competition from other more
dominant otters. In addition, food stealing was most frequently observed in the
early evening.
The lack of a peak of foraging activity in the early morning could be
artifact, due to seasonal variation in tidal height. Since this study was only
carried out in the spring, there were no substantially high tides in the morning.
Kovnat (1982) did not observe a single occurrence of intertidal foraging in the
early morning (0700 to 0930), and attributed this occurrence to intertidal
foraging being of secondary importance to foraging in the subtidal. In order to
test for this effect, further studies would have to be done at other times of the
year, when there are early morning high tides.
In contrast to this study, Kovnat (1982) concluded that large waves have
littie effect on intertidal foraging. As wave heights increased, almost all
