Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
After removing the mussels, the otters float on their backs and consume
prey. The otters foraging off Point Cabrillo usually stayed close (-3 m) to the
mussel beds. Even on relatively rough days, with offshore wave heights of 6 to
7 feet, the otters made no obvious effort to distance themselves from the shore.
After eating a mussel, an otter commonly rolled over face down in the water to
either remove shell debris from its body, wash off a mussel, or possibly drink
water.
There were 14 individually identifiable sea otters and numerous
unidentified sea otters that fed on mussels at Point Cabrillo, and three other
identitied otters that were never seen eating mussels. Of these 14, only one
was a male, and it dove for mussels only on one occasion. However, this male
and one other male were regularly seen stealing mussels from females.
Usually, the male swam quickly to the area, stole the mussels from two or three
dives, and then the female quit diving and started to groom herself, so the male
would leave. Shortly after, the female usually resumed foraging again.
Sometimes the female and the male left the area together. The reactions from
the females varied from a violent scuffle to willing relinquishment of the
mussels.
Even though there were 14 otters seen foraging on mussels, there was
only one individual that was observed almost every day. Approximately half of
the observations include this otter, since she was foraging on mussels for the
majority of her diet. There was another otter that was observed frequently for
the first two and a half weeks, then not seen again until the final few days of the
