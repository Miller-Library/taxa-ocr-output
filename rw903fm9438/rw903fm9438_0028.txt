Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
FIGURE LEGENDS:
Figure 1: A map of Point Cabrillo. The two main sites of otter foraging are
indicated.
Figure 2: A comparison of the mean number of mussels removed and mean
number of mussels eaten per dive among 7 otters. Error bars are
standard error.
Figure 3a: Mean number of otter foraging on mussels taken at hour intervals
and plotted against time of day. Error bars are standard error.
Figure 3b: Mean number of otters foraging on mussels throughout the day,
divided up into wave height category. Number of otters taken at each
wave height at hour intervals. Error is standard error.
Figure 4a: Mean number of Ã–tters foraging on mussels per day plotted against
tidal height. Error is standard error.
Figure 4b: Mean number of otters foraging on mussels per day plotted against
tidal height, and then divided up by wave height categories. Error is
standard error.
Figure 5: Mean number of otters mussel foraging per day at each wave height
category. Error is standard error.
