Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was carried out at Point Cabrillo (also known as Mussel Point).
at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, from April 22 to May 30,
1996. Observations were made between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. The rocky
intertidal community on the exposed side of the point is dominated by the
California mussel, Mytilus californianus, and sea otters forage there regularly,
There were two main sites on the point where the otters were observed (Fig. 1).
Observations were made from points along the shore with 20x binoculars or a
Questar spotting scope. While watching otters forage on the mussels beds
frequency of success, proportion of dives in which an otter returned to the
surface with prey, number of mussels removed, number of mussels eaten.
duration of dive, duration of foraging bout, number of dives per minute, and
number of otters foraging throughout the day were all recorded. When possible,
the identity of the otter was also noted.
The number of mussels removed is probably underestimated. Ã–tters
commonly remove mussels in clumps and then place them on their chests while
eating. Only those mussels which were too small or too difficult to crack open
and thus actively discarded or those mussels accidentally dropped could be
counted. Any mussels that fell off the otters chest (whether intentional or not)
while it rolled over to clean off debris or wash of the mussels went uncounted.
When making observations of otters foraging subtidally on food other than
mussels, only the frequency of success was measured consistently,
