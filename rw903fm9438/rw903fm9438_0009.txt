Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
RESULTS
Behavior of sea otter foraging on mussels remained highly consistent
among the different individuals around Point Cabrillo. Most often, the otter dove
very close to shore in shallow water for about 20 seconds and removed a clump
of mussels. Then the otter ate the mussels one at a time, leaving the remaining
mussels on its chest or under flaps of skin under the axilla of each forelimb
while eating. While otters that were not feeding on mussels were frequently
observed using tools to crack open their prey, tools were very rarely used by
otters eating mussels. Generally, the otter split the mussel with its molars, pried
it open and scraped off the meat with its incisors. This characteristic behavior,
along with the bright orange color of the inside of the mussel, facilitated
identification of otters foraging on mussels. Occasionally otters climbed up a
vertical rock face to reach mussels, using the swell to lift them higher, and the
force of gravity to help remove the mussels. Although otters were sometimes
observed foraging on horizontal rock faces, the majority of feeding was done on
submerged vertical faces. The highest spot from which otters removed mussels
was approximately 3.5 feet above MLLW. Ã–tters were seen hauled out on
areas with mussels, and twice observed to bite at the mussels, but they were
never seen actually removing or eating these mussels. No noticeable gaps in
the mussel beds caused by otter foraging were noticed at Point Cabrillo.
However, gaps would be difficult to see since the majority of foraging is done on
beds that are usually submerged.
