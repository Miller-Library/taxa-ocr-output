Randle: Sea Otters and Mussels
was (-S.E.) 3.540.1 mussels per dive, with a maximum of 13 mussels, and
several occurrences of a single mussel being removed. The mean number of
mussels eaten per dive was 3.040.1 mussels per dive, ranging from zero to
twelve mussels. There were also significant differences in the mean duration of
mussel dives for different otters (ANÖVA, p««0.001, Table 3). The mean
duration of dives for the population was 18.440.5 seconds, with a shortest dive
of 6 seconds, and the longest was 47 seconds. Also, the mean duration of dive
decreased significantly with increasing wave height (ANÖVA, p-0.014, Table
4). Only dives made at calm and medium wave heights were analyzed, since
there were very few dives timed at mild wave heights, and none at the roughest
conditions.
Otters made, on average, 0.95 dives per minute while foraging on
mussels. The mean number of mussels removed increased significantly with
duration of dive (ANÖVA, p«0.001, Table 4 ), reaching a peak of 4.9 mussels
removed for dives lasting 30 to 34 seconds. The mean duration of foraging
bouts for the population was 75.744.8 minutes per bout, and it did not vary
significantly among individuals (ANÖVA, p=0.995, Table 5). Increasing wave
height did not effect duration of foraging bout (ANOVA, p-0.680, Table 5).
However, the mean duration of foraging bouts increased slightly as wave height
increased. The mean number of mussels removed and mussels eaten both
decreased significantly (ANÖVA, p40.001, Table 6) as wave height increased.
The average number of otters foraging on mussels throughout the day
(Fig. 3a) increased slightly in the morning and remained constant until 3:00
