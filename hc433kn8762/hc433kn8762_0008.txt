pollution, for although the Salinas plant is the most efficient
plant in removing solids, it is dealing with a much larger vol¬
ume of sewage. Thus, the Salinas plant has the potential of
polluting much more than an inefficient primary plant with:
much lower flow rate.
Figure 5 also lists grans per day of metals leaving each
plant, and gives an intra-plant comparison of which metals
are the heavily emitted. In the Pacific Grove, Salinas, and
Seaside plants zinc is the most heavly emitted trace metal,
followed by copper, lead, manganese, cadmium, and silver in
that order. Nonterey is similar except that it disseminates
more manganese than lead and more silver than cadmium. The
pattern is surprisingly regular.
Values which may be of concern in Figure 4 are those of
Montereys lead and Salinas' cadmium out put. It is known that
lead and cadmium are extremely toxic, and these values ap¬
pear to be rather high. Monterey also appears to be putting
out a great deal of siver which could potentially be of concern.
The disposal of sludge is an important aspect of consid-
eration for the concentrations of trace metals in sludge mul-
tiplyed by the large volumes of sludge accumulated from sew¬
age treatment, acounts for a sizeable amounts of trace metals
