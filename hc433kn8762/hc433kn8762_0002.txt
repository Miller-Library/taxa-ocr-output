treatuent, the prunary systens of Seaside and Pacifie Grove,
the secondary, activated sludge system of Monterey, or the
secondary, trickling filter system of Salinas (Imhoff and
Fair, 1956 ) was the most effective in removing trace metals.
Methods and Materials
Sanples were obtained from one of the four treatment
plants on one of four consecutive Mondays between 10:00
and 11:00 A.M., the time when the plants were experiencing
their daily "peak flow". The samples collected usually con¬
sisted of two liters of influent, four liters of effluent,
and 100 mls. of sludge collected in polyethylene bottles.
To seperate liquid and solid fractions, a minimum of 1.5
liters of influent and 2.0 liters of effluent were first cen¬
trifuged at 10,000 rpms for five minutes. The centrifugate
was collected for analysis. After centrifugation the liquid
phase still contained a modicum of colloidal material that was
for the most part removed by filtration through a glass
fibre filter followed by filtration through a 47 mm., .45u
Millipore filter. The filtrate was then passed through a
"Chelex 100" chelating resin column (Riley and Taylor, 1968 ).
