although is less dense than Nontereys influent sold, occu
pies a much greater volume, and thus the surface area for
adsorbtion is much larger. The activated sludge probably
also concentrates trace metals, since it is constantly being
recycled and because it is digesting partieles that contain
metals. In every case, the effluent solid from the Monterey
plant is much more concentrated in all trace metals than the
influent solid. At times other than peak flow, the Monterey
plant is quite efficient in that very few solids leave the
plant. Since sludge is being removed, there is surely an
overall decrease in the amount of metals leaving than enterÂ¬
ing.
By multiplying the micro-gram per liter concentrations
of a given metal in the influent of each plant (Figure 2
times the number of liters of sewage flow experienced by
the respective plant, estimated values can be obtained for
the total number of grams of that metal leaving the plant
a day ( see Figures 3 and 4). The Monterey figures are
the highest because of the large amounts of solid being
emitted from the plant. The Salinas plant also brings into
view an important aspect to be considered in trace metal
