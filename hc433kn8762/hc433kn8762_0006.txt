usually increase from influent to effluent. It was particu¬
larly interesting that no silver was found in the liquid phase
of any influent or effluent sample. Possibly the silver con¬
centrations were to small to be detected as opposed to no
silver being in solution at all.
Given the concentration of metals in a liter of influent
the weight of solid in that liter, and the concentrations of
metals in that solid, values can be calculated for total micro¬
grams of metals per liter of influent. The same calculation
can be made for effluent samples. Figure 2 compares metal
concentrations found in influent and effluent samples. In
the case of the Salinas, Seaside, and Pacific Grove plants,
it is observed that the amount of a given metal entering the
plants is greater than the amount of that metal leaving the
plant. This is only reasonable, since the removal of trace
metals is synonomous with the removal of solids. The Mon¬
terey plant, however, does not follow this pattern, for it
is seen that the concentrations of all metals except cadmium
are higher leaving the plant than entering. This trend is
explained by the fact that during peak flow the plant is re¬
leasing a great amount of activated sludge flocculent which
