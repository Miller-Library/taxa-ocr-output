Introduction
Several trace metals are known to be harmful to mar-
ine organisms. Examples of such elements include cadmium,
lead, copper, silver, and zinc (Bowen,1966 ). Thus it is
neccessary to determine the rate of introduction of these
metals into local environments. In attempting to explain
incongruencies of trace metal concentrations found in cer¬
tain marine organisms sampled from different locations around
Monterey Bay (Fitz, 1971 ), it was thought that local sew¬
age outfalls were acting as point sources of trace metal
induction into the Bay. Therefore, having picked for study
the primary sewage treatment plants of Seaside and Pacific
Grove and the secondary plants of Nonterey and Salinas, the
aim of this project was to first develope a viable technique
for quantitatively analyzing for the trace metals, cadmium,
lead, copper, silver, zinc, and manganese, in influent, efflu¬
ent, and sludge of a given treatment plant and second to
obtain first estimates of the amounts of these trace metals
entering Monterey Bay from each of these sewage plants.
This study was also intended, simultaneousy, to determine
the mode of transport of trace metals through the sewage
