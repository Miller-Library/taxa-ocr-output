Results and Discussion
Determinations of the amounts of dry weight solid per
liter of influent and effluent are recorded in Figure 1. It
should be remembered that these values are representative
of "peak flow". It is noted that the two primary plants,
Seaside and Pacific Grove, operate at roughly similar effic¬
iencies in removing solids. The secondary plant of Salinas
removes approximately 91% of the solids that enter, while
the secondary palnt of Monterey, being overloaded during
peak flow, removes only about 20% of the solids. The ef¬
fluent solid of Monterey is comprised mainly of an activated
sludge flocculent.
Results of trace metal analyses of solid and liquid
phases of influents and effluents, as well as sludge, are
listed in Table 1. All trace metal concentrations in the
solids are clearly much higher than those found in the liquid.
This is probably due to adsorbtionof metals onto particulate
matter. Perhaps further support for adsorbtion of metals
onto particulate matter is that the concentrations of metals
in the liquids usually derease from influent to effluent in a
given plant, while the concentrations of metals on the solids
