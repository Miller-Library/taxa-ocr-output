fluent was filtered through two pre-weighed.8u Millipore
filters, the bottom filter being used as a blank. The fil¬
ters were dried and weighed to determine the amount of
solid that was to be analyzed. Both filters were oxidized
seperately in a nuffle furnace. 5 ml. of 906 hmo, was
added to the ashed filters, followed by dilution to 25 ml.
Both samples were analyzed for trace metals with the spec-
trophotometer, again with the "bottom" fülter used as a
blank.
To determine the weight of solid in a liter of influent
of effluent, two 25 ml. aliquots of each influent and efflu-
ent sample were fitered through two pre-weighed Millipore
filters. The filters were dreid and weighed, and the bottom
filter was used as a blank. From these weighings, the
amount of sold, dry weight, was calculated per liter.
Sediments were sampled at stations of 30, 200, and
600 feet from the Monterey plant outfall aperture. Par-
ticles suspended in the water were allowed to fall into glass
tubes vertically positioned at each station. Sediments were
dried at 800c, and one gram aliquots were ashed in a muffle
furnace and analyzed for trace metals with atomic absorption.
