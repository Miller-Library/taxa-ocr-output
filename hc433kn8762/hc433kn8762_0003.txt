The metals were eluted from the resin colunn with 40 ml. of
AN HNO,: The eluted solutions were analyzed for trace metals
with atomie absorption spectroscopy (Christian and Feldman,
1970 ).
The solid centrifugate obtained from centrifugation of
the influent, effluent, and sludge samples were dried at
80°c. Aliquots of approximately .5 grams were measured out
into 30 ml. beakers and were either oxidized in a muffle fur-
nace at 4000c for eight hours or digested in 906 HNO, and
oxidized with H,02: After samples had been digested, the
volume of acid was evaporated to 5 ml. and then made up to
a volume of 25 ml. with distilled water. The samples that
were ashed in the muffle furnace were dissolved in 5 ml. of
90% HNO, and then diluted to 25 ml. with distilled water.
The 25 ml. samples were anlyzed for trace metals with an
atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
Due to the very limited amount of solid in the effluent
of the Salinas plant, it was neccessary to use a different
method for trace metal analysis than those previosly de¬
scribed. The method employed was similar to that used by
Spencer and Sachs (1970 ). In this case, 100 ml. of ef¬
