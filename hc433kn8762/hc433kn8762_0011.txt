when each of the plants were experiencing peak flow, the
values obtained probably more closely represent maximums.
Since the Monterey Bay area has only a limited amount
of industry, it is fairly safe to assume that the amount
of trace metals being deposited into the Bay from local
sewage systems is substantially less than the amount of
metals emitted from sewage plants in more industrialized
areas. Nontheless, it appears that the four sewage plants
tested in this work are dumping large volumes of dangerous
trace metals into the Bay. It is my belief that if these
sewage plants are not made more efficient in removing trace
metals from sewage, trace metal pollution will begin to cause
serious detrimental effects in various aspects of the Monterey
Bay ecology.
Abstract
The four sewage plants of Monterey, Seaside, Salinas,
and Pacific Grove were analyzed for trace metals in their
influents, effluents, and sludges. Totalled from the four
plants it was estimated that 196 grams of cadmium, 1,550
grams of lead, 3,500 grams of copper, 1,600 grams of man-
ganese, 14,100 grams of ainc, and 430 grams of silver were
being dumped into the Bay daily.
