(Hickman, 1970 ). The Monterey plant incinerates its sludge
and removes the resulting ash to a city disposal center.
The Seaside plant dries its sludge in drying beds, and then
gives the sludge away as fill dirt, fertilizer, etc. Hick¬
amn warns that the deposition of sludge onto agricultural
lands could in certain instances be veryharmful due to high
concentrations of trace metals in the sludge. The Pacific
Grove sewage plant, operating with an ineffective digester
periodically dumps all of its sludge into the Bay. Thus,
Pacific Grove is effectively no removing any metals from
its influent at all. The Salinas plant also digests its sludge,
however, a constant level is kept in the digesting tank by
recycling partially digested materials back into the influent
where it can then be processed further. Therefore, since
the system remains "closed" and no wastes are being ac¬
tively removed from the plant, all trace metals entering the
plant will ultimately end up in the effluent.
Figure 6 shows the results of trace metal analyses
made of sediments collected near the Monterey outfall. Ap
parently what seems to be happening is that most of the
heavier particles disseminated from the outfall which con¬
tain trace metals are sedimenting rather evenly within the first
