20 feet. Although lichter partieles may be travellig
large distances from the outfall, fewer particles from
the outfall are reaching station 3, 600 feet away. As
a result, sediments bund at station 3 have the smallest
concentration of metals. It was estimated in Figure 5
that the Monterey plant was emitting its greatest amount
trace metal in zinc, followed by copper, lead, manganese,
silver, and cadmium in that order, however, the concen¬
trations found near the outfall, from highest to lowest,
were of manganese, zinc, lead, copper, silver, and cadmium.
Although slightly similar, the incongruence illustrates the
fact that little is known about the behavior of various
trace elements deposited from fresh water effluents into
marine waters, such as the percent of a given metal that
precipitates, which metals remain in solution, and the dis¬
semination and transportation behavior of sewage particu-
late matter (Krauskopf, 1956).
This study is only perliminary. Due to time factors,
only a modicum of samples were able to be analyzed from
each of the treatment plants. Since samples were taken
