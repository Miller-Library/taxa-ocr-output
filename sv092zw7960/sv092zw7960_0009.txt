Adhesion in water has been difficult to achieve artificially, but adhesives have important
industrial value in the building of bridges and other water structures.
The relation between the M. edulis byssus threads and P. californica adhesion
systems is still unknown. P. californica egg adhesion does seem to use an enzyme,
TGase, that is involved in scleroprotein stability. However, some evidence suggests that
the two systems are not similar. Demembranation was possible in a solution of sodium
citrate and sucrose, whereas the proteins in mussel are insoluble. Spawning in a protease
solution also decreased egg stickiness, while mussel proteins are resistant to protease.
Therefore, and P. californica eggs do not appear to conform directly to the mussel model
system. The P. californica adhesive eggs pose many interesting questions that require
further experimentation.
