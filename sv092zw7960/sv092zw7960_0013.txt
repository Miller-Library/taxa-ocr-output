Fig. 1 Spawing directly into different solutions to test the effects of altering surface
proteins and carbohydrates, and to test charge of surface. OCa-OCaSW w/EDTA;
FSW-filtered seawater; PRO-protease; BOR-borate; PLY-polylysine coat. Clear region
is standard deviation, grey is mean value. Y-axis is relative stickiness.
Fig. 2 Adhesion before and after fertilization (at 2-4 cell and 32-64 cell stages). All were
spawned directly into normal seawater.
Fig. 3 Membranated and demembranated eggs, in normal seawater. OCaSW with EDTA
is present for comparison. Demembranated eggs are the control for unstickiness.
Fig. 4. Varying conditions of calcium. FSW-filtered seawater; OCa-calcium-free
seawater without chelator; EDTA-OCaSW with EDTA as a chelator; CaCl2-addition of
CaCla crystals to OCaSW w/EDTA; »FSW-transfer from OCaSW w/EDTA to filtered
seawater.
Fig. 5 Spawning into OCaSW w/EDTA then transferring to different enzyme inhibitors.
GEE-glycine ethyl ester; DC-dansylcadaverine; PUT-putrescine; EDA-ethylenediamine
BAPN-B-aminopropionitrile; SUL-sulfanilate; STI-soybean trypsin inhibitor;
BSA=bovine serum albumin. Lowered stickiness (considering standard deviations) was
apparent only for DC, PUT, and EDA.
Fig. 6 Logarithmic concentration dilution curve for dansylcadaverine. Inhibition of
adhesion is apparent until 107 M.
Fig. 7 Spawning onto different surfaces. Surfaces (from left to right) are: Iridaea,
Macrocystis, Gigartina canaliculata, Cystoseira, Gigartina leptorhynchos, rough rock, sand
tube, keyhole limpet shell, smooth rock, plastic, and glass.
