A survey of stickiness was conducted on different surfaces, suggesting a variable
adhesion to different surfaces (Fig. 7). Only extreme values were consistent, showing
Iridea, Macrocystis, and plastic to be very low in adhesiveness, while glass was very high.
No conclusions could be made about the other surfaces, as the standard deviations were
very high.
Discussion
The results of this study indicate that the membrane of P. californica eggs has
properties of other egg outer coats. The strong adhesion to a positively-charged polylysine
coat indicates a negative charge on the egg, a common feature in other species, including
Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus.
Calcium appears to effect adhesion, even at very low levels. The elimination of
calcium and trace metals with a chelator was necessary to lower stickiness substantially.
Calcium may be acting on the egg either directly, as a cofactor for an enzyme or as a
secondary messenger. Direct action may involve a Ca2--dependent system such as that in
cell-cell interactions for keratinocytes (Alberts, et al., 1989). However, the need to remove
all traces of Ca2* (or trace metals) suggests that Ca2+ may be acting as a cofactor or
secondary messenger.
Decreased adhesion in observed solutions of DC and PUT suggest that the cross-
linking enzyme transglutaminase (TGase) may be involved. Although EDA was
consistently low, BAPN results were inconclusive, so the presence of lysyl oxidase is not
conclusive. EDA may have affected the cell in a manner other than a lysyl oxidase
inhibitor. For example, EDA is a weak chelator and may have removed a necessary metal
other than calcium. Furthermore, EDA may serve as an inhibitor for TGase, acting as a
primary amine competitive inhibitor (Lorand, 1979).
DC was the most effective inhibitor of stickiness, and is known as the highest
affinity inhibitor for TGase (Lorand, 1979). It was a potent inhibitor at very low
