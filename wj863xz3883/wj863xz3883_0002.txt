Intraspecific physiological variation over a range
of depths and tidal heights has been investigated for
several species of marine algae. When placed in a vari-
ety of osmotic conditions, algae which lived in tide
pools and were accustomed to emersion displayed greater
tolerance than those continuously submerged (Biebl.
1962). Some red algae were reported to have survived
in concentrations ranging from .l to 3 times the con-
centration of sea water. Burns and Mathieson (1972)
determined salinity to be a dominant factor in the dis-
tribution and growth of G.
tina stellata. Biebl (1962)
has also found differences in ability to resist desic-
cation among intertidal and subtidal algae of similar
morphology. The importance of intraspecific morpho¬
logical variation as a basis for differences in resis¬
tance to desiccation has been pointed out by Bergquist
(1959). The photosynthetic efficiency of intertidal
algae when exposed to air was found to depend largely
on their ability to ratain water (Biebl, 1962). The
photopigment content of several intertidal Rhodophyceae
has been qualitatively analyzed by Strain (1951), who
found the pigments in these species to be the same as
