igartina papillata exhibits considerable morpho-
logical and physiological variation over its range of
heights in its characteristic zone in the intertidal
region. Female plants are the more abundant in the lower
and medium regions of the zone, whereas male/steriles
predominate in the highest region. Individuals of
higher regions of the zone are shorter and turflike,
ith relatively thicker thalli at the tips and middle
portions; those of lower regions are longer and more
isolated. The higher plants are better adapted to re-
sist environmental stresses such as desiccation and saÂ¬
linity variation, as evidenced by slower drying rates
and fewer signs of death relative to plants from medium
and low regions. Male/steriles from high and low regions
are shown spectrophotometrically to differ in pigment
composition, with the darker-appearing low plants con-
taining more chorophyll and biliproteins. Photosyn-
thetic rates of lower male/steriles surpass those of
plants from other regions in parallel with differences
in pigment content. Results on pigment content and pho-
tosynthetic rates of female plants, expecially from lower
regions, are difficult to interpret, possibly because of
unknown physiological effects of the numerous cystocarps.
