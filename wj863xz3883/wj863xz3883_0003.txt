in deep water species. The relative amounts of these
pigments, however, has not been ascertained.
The variation among individuals of both sexes of
a single species at different heights within the inter-
tidal region is less well documented. Preliminary ob-

intertidal region and occupying a distinct zone, indi-
cated it would be suitable for such a study. This spe-
cies exhibits remarkable variability in morphological
characters such as length and thickness of fronds over
its height range. It also varies in color from golden
in the higher plants to dark brown in lower individuals.
The distribution and abundance, and physiological vari-
ation of male/sterile and female individuals are not
known.

MATERTADS AND PE
For field studies on distribution, abundance and
morphological variation, the following tools were em-
ployed: a 25 meter transect line marked every half me¬
ter; a 15 cm ruler to measure frond length; a micrometer
to measure thickness of fronds to the nearest.l mm.
Thirty transects one meter apart were laid over the
northwest area of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, Califor-
nia. Each transect line extended from the highest boun-
