an infrared gas analyzer (Beckman #215). Light for
photosynthesis was provided by a Quartzlite (Appleton

The results of field studies are shown in Figs.
1-3. The highest concentration of G. papillata was
found at the medium height level, with females more
abundant than male/steriles (Fig. 1). Male/steriles,
however, were the more abundant in the high region, where
the turflike form predominated. Fig. 2 expresses the
difference in morphology between the short, turflike
high plants and the longer, more isolated low and me-
dium samples. As Fig. 3 shows, tips and middle parts
of plants steadily increased in thickness from low to
high regions. Basal portions became thicker from low
regions up to the lower boundary of the high regions,
where male/steriles began to decrease in thickness. Fe-
males, on the other hand, showed thicker bases in higher
regions.
Although the samples in various salinities all ap-
peared to have survived the twelve hour period, the low
distilled water sample had begun to swell at the tips.
