dary of the G.
illata zone (1.1-1.4 m above mean low
low water) to the lowest boundary (0.0-O.3 m above MLLI).
Any G. papillata individual that lay under or fell
across the line was scored for sex, frond length, and
thickness of the frond at the base, middle and tip.
The
individual was also classified according to its rela-
tive height in the G. pap
ta zone, values of 1.0,
0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, or 0.0 signifying progressively
lower tidal heights. This arbitrary scale should not
be confused with absolute measurements of tidal height.
The crustose tetrasporophyte phase of Giga
ting
papillata,
trocelis sp. (Polanshek and West, 1977) was not inclu-
ded in this study.
In the laboratory, two male/sterile individuals
from low (0.0 - 0.2), medium (0.4 - 0.6) and high (0.8 -
1.0) levels were placed in solutions (200 ml) of vary¬
ing salinity: distilled water, .l times the concentra-
tion of sea water (SW), .5 x SW, SW (control), 3 x SW,
and 5 x SW. Sea water was diluted with distilled water
to obtain lower concentrations, and increased in concen¬
tration by the addition of Instant Ocean crystals. The
plants in their solutions were checked after twelve
hours and then allowed to remain in these concentrations
