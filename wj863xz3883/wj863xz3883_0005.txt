for six days. Any changes in appearance were noted.
particularly color changes indicative of cell death.
Desiccation rates for male/sterile and female
plants from low, medium and high regions were deter-
mined by drying the fronds in the lab at 24°0. and re-
cording weight loss every 30 minutes for eight hours.
To test for variation in pigment content male/
steriles and females from low, medium and high regions
were dried at 25°0., ground in a ball mill, weighed and
their pigments (R-phycoerythrin, R-phycocyanin, and
chlorophyll a) extracted in test tubes. To minimize
denaturation the biliproteins, R-phycoerythrin and R-
phycocyanin, were extracted first in Tris-HOl buffer and
the solutions refrigerated overnight (L.R. Blinks, 1979,
personal communication). The tubes were then centri¬
fuged to sediment suspended particles and the clear so-
lutions placed in a spectrophotometer (Gilford +252)
to determine absorption spectra. Ground samples were
washed with distilled water to remove the buffer, dried.
and the chlorophyll a extracted with acetone (Jensen.
1978). After refrigeration and centrifugation these
solutions were also analyzed on the spectrophotometer.
