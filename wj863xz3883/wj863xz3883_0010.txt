females. Most numerous on lower females, cystocarps
were present on all females and might account for the
overall lower values for females than for males of the
same tidal height.
In view of their higher pigment content, the greater
photosynthetic rate of the low male/steriles can be unÂ¬
derstood (Fig. 7). In addition, the similarity in the
rates of the medium and high male/steriles parallelled
their agreement in pigment content. The photosynthetic
rates of female plants, though following the trend of
male/steriles, cannot be explained due to ambiguous
data concerning pigment composition.
rtina papillata displays considerable variation
in morphological and physiological characteristics over
the range of its zone. The higher, turflike individ-
uals must tolerate conditions of extreme physiological
stress in the intertidal region. Lower plants, on the
other hand, less accustomed to harsh physical conditions,
are not as well adapted to meet these conditions. They
seem more exposed, however, to the grazing of intertidal
herbivores. Physiological variation in male/sterile
plants parallelled their expected adaptations, whereas
variation in female individuals was less predictable.
