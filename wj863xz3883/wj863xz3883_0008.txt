for females, with the values for low females consider-
ably lower than those of low male/steriles. Except for
chlorophyll a absorbances of medium females, females of
a given height level exhibited lower absorbances than
male/steriles of the same level.
Photosynthetic rates of both sex groups were mark-
edly greater than those of medium and high levels, which
had similar rates (Fig. 7).

Field studies on the abundance and distribution of
G. papillata revealed that individuals are least abun-
dant in the lower regions of the G. papillata zone (Fig.
1). From the tattered appearance of many of the lower
individuals, it seemed that grazing might play a role
ta. With re-
in limiting the lower range of G. papill
spect to morphology, the short, high plants (Fig. 2),
in contrast to the longer, low individuals, grew closely
together to form a matlike turf. This turf collected
sand and bits of shell and might retard desiccation by
retaining water during low tides. Thicker tips and
middle portions (Fig. 3) might also aid the higher plants
in resisting desiccation. If initial rate of drying is
an indicator of resistance to desiccation, the thicker,
