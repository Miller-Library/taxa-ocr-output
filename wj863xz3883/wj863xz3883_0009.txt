resistant plants of higher regions would be expected to
dry slower than the thinner, less often exposed indi-
viduals of lower regions. The results for male/ster-
iles agree with these predictions (Fig. 5). The unex-
pectedly low rate for the lower females might have reÂ¬
sulted from retention of water by the cystocarps and
papillae, which were most numerous on lower females.
The thinner bases of high male/steriles (Fig. 3) can
be explained by their shortness, which might allow them
to be anchored sufficiently by thinner basal portions
than plants of other levels.
Pigment concentrations varied consistently within
the sexes over the range of heights in the G.
pillata
zone. Low male/steriles exhibited the greatest pigment
absorbances and therefore contained more of the three
pigments than medium or high male/steriles (Fig. 6).
This higher pigment content would account for the dar-
ker color of the low male/steriles. The low female
plants consistently yielded values lower than expected
on the basis of their similarity to the male/steriles
in color. Perhaps cystocarps contained less pigment
than ordinary thallus tissue. If they represented a
significant fraction of the total weight of the plant,
they could account for the depressed value of the low
