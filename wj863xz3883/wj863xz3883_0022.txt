steriles and females from low, medium and
high regions of the G. pap
illata zone.
Grouped male/steriles of different heights
at left, females at right. L (black) sig-
nifies low height in zone, M (cross-hatched)--
medium, H (white)--high. The variance be-
tween these slopes is significant at the
99% confidence level: p «.001.
Absorbances of R-phycoerythrin, R-phycocyanin,
and chlorophyll a at maximum absorbing wave-
lengths (565 nm, 615 nm and 430 nm, respec¬
tively) for male/steriles and females of low,
medium and high heights in the G. pap
illata
zone. Male/steriles in black, females in
white.
Photosynthetic rates (mg 00, consumed per
g dry weight algae per hour) for male/ster-
iles and females from low, medium and high
regions of the G. papillata zone. Male/
steriles in black, females in white.
