that the presence of the clear outside covering of the embryo
is the most likely means of protection. The mechanism by which
adults endure these high salinities is not known. However, the
properties of the animal's exoskeleton might be involved in main-
taining this high tolerance.
The embryos are less tolerant to low salinities; how-
ever, it seems that they would never be subjected to salinities
of less than 50% sea water, for the adult barnacles close their
opercular plates at salinities lower than this, completely sealing
themselves from the environment by this means.
High salinities, on the other hand, may be unavoida-
ble when the organisms are subjected to high temperatures. EvaÂ¬
poration of the shell water and the consequent transfer of man-
tle cavity water to the shell as well as direct evaporation from
the mantle cavity might occur even though the opercular plates
were closed. It is not surprising, therefore, that B. glandula
has adapted to high salinities by some mechanism other than oper-
cular closure.
The adult and brooded embryos of Balanus glandula can
withstand the salinities normally imposed by exposure in the in-
tertidal. Their distribution would not be limited by salinity
unless the extreme conditions were so persistant as to cause
starvation, an excessive accumulation of waste products, or in-
hibition of larval settlement and development. The high tolerance
of B. glandula to salinity is one factor enabling it to inhabit
the highest intertidal zone.
Summary
1. The mantle cavity temperature of Balanus glandula closely
follows its shell surface temperature.
Adults can withstand from 0% to 300% sea water; they exclude the
lower salinities by closing the opercular plates, effectively
sealing themselves off from the surrounding water.
Embryos can tolerate from 50% to 200% sea water.
Salinity does not appear to be a limiting factor in the dis-
tribution of Balanus glandula.
