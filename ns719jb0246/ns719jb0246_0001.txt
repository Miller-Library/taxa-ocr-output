Introduction
Doty (1946) correlates intertidal zonation with
critical exposure time and suggests that an organism's
upper limit is determined primarily by its ability to with-
stand the stresses which such exposure imposes; the more
resistant an organism is to temperature and salinity varia-
tion, dessication, and other factors resulting from exposure,
the higher it can exist in the intertidal. Many species
of barnacle inhabit the upper intertidal zones and consequent-
ly might be expected to be resistant to these same stresses.
Since barnacles are poikiotherms, it is reasonable
to suspect that their body temperature would closely follow
the temperature of their substrate. Indeed,Suzuki and Mori
(1963) reported that the shell surface and the body tempera-
ture of Tetraclita squamosa japonica remained the same, but
this temperature was always slightly lower than that of the
barnacle's substrate because of the cooling effect of evapo¬
ration of mantle cavity and body water. This evaporation
would be expected to increase the salinity of the mantle
cavity fluid.
It appears then that under normal conditions of
exposure high intertidal barnacles would be subjected to
salinity extremes due to (1) fresh water from precipitation
and consequent runoff and (2) high mantle cavity salinity
due to evaporation resulting from high midday temperatures.
It is, therefore, expected that these organisms might show
adaptations to extreme salinities.
This expectation has been in part confirmed by
Borusk and Kreps (1929), who showed that B. balanoides (L)
and B. crenatus Brug. can exist for three weeks in fresh
water in a state of 'salt sleep', a state in which all cirral
activity ceases, the opercular plates are closed, and res¬
piration is maintained at a low level. Furthermore, Barnes
and Barnes (1958) reported that B. balanoides feeds normally
in 60% to 90% sea water, opens but does not feed in 50% sea
