nephridia may also help provide a fluid flow.
It would be interesting to follow the embryological development
of these organs to facilitate comparison with the tubular nephridia of
other polychaetes. Physiological work on the functions of the organs is
also necessary.
In line with the preceeding discussion, it is presumed that the
posterior gonoducts do not function as nephridia. Their location posterior
to the anterior septum in each segment suggests they may consist of
nephridial tissue and may function as simple nephridia. Caullery and
Mesnil (1898) noted in Dodecaria concharum that coelomostomes with short
ducts developed at the time of spawning. The present study was carried
out when most worms were spawning and the ducts observed could have been
in the process of development. They may be absent or vestigial during the
rest of the yaer or the rest of the worms' life cycle.
V. Conclusions
1. The nephridia of Cirriformia spirobrancha have been described to
be a pair of sac-like organs with a large blood supply and extensive
internal surface area located in the first two post-prostomial segments.
2. The presumed gonoducts have been described to be simple tubules
located in the genital region.
3. Possible functions for both nephridia and gonoducts have been
postulated.
