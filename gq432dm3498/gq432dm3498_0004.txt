of this study were thus to describe the nephridial anatomy of C. spiro-
brancha and to determine the extent and possible explanation of the
observed dimorphism.
This study determined that all individuals of C. spirobrancha
possess a single pair of large anterior mixonephridia and segmental nephridia
or coelomoducts in the genital region presumably serving as gonoducts.
The anterior organs have a unique sac-like morphology and an extensive
blood supply, while the genital organ's anatomy is not entirely clear.
II. Materials and Methods
Worms were collected from intertidal mud flats by municipal pier
fl, Monterey, California. Both live dissection and fixed and stained
serial sections in transverse, medial, and sagittal planes were used.
In dissection, the worms were anesthetized by addition of crystals of
magnesium chloride to sea water in a dissecting pan to a concentration
of approximately 7.5%. The body wall was opened by a lateral incision
along the dorsolateral row of setae. For prepared sections, worms were
relaxed in magnesium chloride, fixed in Bouin's fluid, embedded in paraffin,
cut at 10 and 14 microns, and stained according to Masson's trichrome
connective tissue technique as modified by Foot and by Coldner. A
series of camera lucida sketches on index cards was prepared to aid in
visualizing the internal anatomy of the nephridia.
III. Description of the Nephridia and Gonoducts
The nephridia are a pair of sac-like organs located in the
first two segments posterior to the prostomium ventrolateral to the pharynx.
They were not consistently observed early in the course because dissections
as a rule were made with dorsal or ventral incisions either missing or
destroying the nephridia.
The nephrostome is a large heavily ciliated funnel opening inte
