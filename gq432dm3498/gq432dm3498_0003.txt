The Morphology of the Nephridia and Genital Ducts of Cirriformia Spirobrancha
I. Introduction
The object of this study was the polychaete annelid Cirriformia
spirobrancha (Moore, 1904). A member of the family Cirratulidae, C.
spirobrancha is a sedentary worm, up to six inches long and 1 inch in
diameter, living in black mud in intertidal and shallow subtidal mud flats
and sheltered tide pools. It lives burrowed with its anterior end just
below the substrate surface and its tentacles extended above the surface.
The literature of the nephridial anatomy of the annelidae is
scanty at best with the exceptions of the Nereidae (Jones, 1957) and
Lumbricus, an oligochaete. Goodrich's excellent summary (1945) covers
nearly all the known literature to date. Thus there is a limited back-
ground of well-described species with which to compare new findings.
Goodrich cites the work of E. Meyer (1887) describing the family Cirratulidae
in general terms. He found two types of nephridia, an anterior pair of
mixonephridia with very long excretory canal and numerous posterior mixo-
nephridia in the genital region composed almost entirely of large coelom-
ostomes. Goodrich also mentions Caullery and Mesnil's findings (1898) that
in Dodecaria concharum the anterior organs are as expected, but in epitokus
forms large coelomostomes develop late from the coelomic epithelium on the
anterior face of the posterior septa, fuze with the epidermis, and form pores
through which issue the genital products. No nephridial canal element was
found contributing to these genital ducts and possibly they represent
coelomostomes only.
It had been observed by students and faculty of this course prior
to this study that a pair of large anterior nephridia seemed to be present
in only about one-fifth of the C. spirobrancha individuals observed. Further,
no smaller nephridia or coelomoducts were seen posteriorly. The objectives
