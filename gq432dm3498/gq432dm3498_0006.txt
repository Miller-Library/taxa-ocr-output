closely with the region of production and storage of the gametes. The
ducts were not seen in fixed and stained material due to tearing of the
sections by grit in the gut. In dissection they appear white in color and
lie just posterior to each septum in this region one pair to a segment. They
are about O.3 mm. long and about 50 microns in outside diameter. They
appear to open to the outside at the level of the ventrolateral ros of setae.
No obvious funnel was present at the inner end of the duct and the duct was
not seen to pierce the septum. There appeared to be little or no blood
supply. The inner end lies close to the venteral nerve cord and ventral
blood vessel at the base of the coelomic cavity.
IV. Discussion
The nephridia do not have the convoluted tubule morphology described
for the Nereidae (Jones, 1957). However, the nephridial anatomy described
for C. spirobrancha is reasonable. The worm is sedentary, yet does not
irrigate its burrow as do some other burrowing polychaetes. Thus it
must excrete its waste products at its anterior end. The worm does not
appear to move enough to be able to leave its wastes behind it as it burrows.
Waste products presumably are carried in the blood from the posterior parts
of the body to the capillary nets in the nephridia or to those lining
the coelomic cavity of the prostomium into which the nephrostome extends.
These capillary nets are the locus of exchange of solutes between blood and
coelomic fluid. The nephridia then pump out the dissolved wastes in the
urine. The cilia in the nephrostome provide the current of fluid through
the nephridium. The cilia and the convolutions in the wall of the organ
help direct the flow and keep the fluid near the walls in constant motion
facilitating exchange. Reabsorbtion of substances from the coelomic fluid
to the blood is similarly accomplished. Contractions of the extensive
musculature associated with the pharynx and body wall in the region of the
