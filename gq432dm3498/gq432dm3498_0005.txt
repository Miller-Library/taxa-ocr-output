the prostomial coelomic cavity in close proximity to the lateral body wall
and the extensive prostomial capillary beds. The funnel opening faces
dorsally and measures about 100 microns in diameter in fixed and stained
preparations. The whole funnel structure is 150 to 200 microns long. The
funnel narrows posteriorly as it passes through the septum and leads into
the cavity of the nephridium.
The body of the nephridium is about 6mm. long by 3 mm. high by
2 mm. wide and shows some involution in its outer wall. Its color varies
from light yellow to black over its surface; the darker colors are due
to blood capillaries in the outer wall. The wall is fragile and easily
torn in dissection. When opened, the interior surface of the nephridial
sac appears convoluted; in fixed and stained material subject to some
shrinkage and contraction, the interior of the sac is filled with these
convolutions. In dissection, the convolutions follow a characteristic
pattern. The dark color of blood vessels close to the surface is especially
evident on the convolutions. In fixed and stained preparations, the inter-
ior wall appears lightly ciliated, the cilia ocurring in tufts uniformly
distributed over the entire interior surface. The wall appears to be two
to three cell layers thick. The cell boundaries are indistinct; the outer
layer seems to be a continuation of the lining of the coelom. The wall
shows a lack of connective tissue or muscle fibers and is heavily supplied
with blood capillaries.
The nephridiopores are located posterior to the first septum and
lie on either side of the ventral nerve cord posterior to the point of
junction of the two circumpharyngeal connectives. The tubule leading to the
pore is 25-30 microns in diameter. The duct, unlike the body of the
nephridium, does not appear ciliated.
