SUMMARY
1. A comparative study of dessication in three species of
Balanus from different intertidal zones was undertaken.
2. It was found that the high intertidal B. glandula is
adapted to dessication by being able to tolerate large
body water losses. Though B. glandula normally respires
aerobically it can revert to partial glycolysis under
conditions of extreme stress.
3. The lower intertidal species B. nubilis and B. tintin-
nabulum were found not to possess any special adaptive
mechanism that would enable them to cope with extreme
dessication.
