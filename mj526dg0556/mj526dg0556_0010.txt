posed surface area to body volume in larger animals is less
than that in smaller ones, B. nubilis and B. tintinnabulum
would be expected to have proportionately less area devoted
to respiratory surfaces than would the smaller B. glandula.
Both of the larger intertidal spocies have gill-like fila-
ments attached to the wall of the mantle cavity, which effect-
ively increase their respiratory surfaces, whereas B. glan-
dula lacks these structures (G. Hilgard, 1967). Daniel (1955)
found that the constant beating of the opercular muscles in
B. tintinnabulum was a respiratory adaptation serving to main-
tain a uniform flow of water past the respiratory tissues
of the body and the gills. It thus appears that the cont-
inued cirral activity of exposed B. nubilis and B. tintin-
nabulum is a continuation of their normal respiratory act-
ivity which, undor these circumstances, is non-adaptive.
On the other hand, when B. glandula is exposed, it minimizes
its oxygen needs by remaining motionless (von Brand, 1946)
and so reduces its respiratory rate, as seen both in this
study and by Kreps and Borsuk (1929) in their study on
Balanus crenatus, a barnacle very similar to B. glandula
On exposure then, B. glandula seemingly modifies its
respiratory rate, whereas B. tintinnabulum and B. nubilis
do not.
A high ratio of surface to air may increase the resp-
iratory capabilities of an animal, but it also promotesmore
rapid evaporation. The continued cirral activity of the
