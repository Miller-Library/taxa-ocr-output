and O.5ml. Ba(OH),, at a pH of 7.0, followed by centrifugation
for thirty minutes. O.5ml. of the resulting supernatant was
added to 1.4ml. of a glycine-hydrazine buffer (pH9.4) and O.lml.
of a 0.025M solution of DPN. The absorbance of the solution was
read on a spectrophotometer at 340mu. 5Yof lactic dehydrogenase
was added at room temperature and the change in optical density
(AOD) was read after thirty minutes. This test measures the
shift of DPN to DPNH' as a result of the following reaction:
DPN + lactate
pyruvate + DPNH' + H'. The shift is related
to lactic acid by the formula, moles lactic acid - 2
X 10
031
The result was calculated as molarity of lactic acid per gram
of body weight.
Oxygen consumption was measured by the WINKLER method
(of. Welsh, 1953). Speoimens of the three species were scraped
and brushed to remove algae and then put in sealed, volume-
controlled plexiglass respiratory chambers. Eleven B. glandula,
six B. tintinnabulum, and two B. nubilis were used, one species
per chamber. The chambers were filled with millipore-filtered
seawater with an oxygen content of 5.1ml. 0/liter. A lmg./1.
solution of streptomycin was added to inhibit bacterial resp-
iration. The oxygen decrease in each chamber was measured after
the apparatus had been placed in the dark at 13'C. for two
hours. From these results a standard rate of respiration for
the three species was calculated. The chambers were then filled
with water that had been bubbled with nitrogen for twenty-four
hours in order to remove the oxygen and the apparatus was again
-4-
20.
