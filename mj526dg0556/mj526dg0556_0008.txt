laboratory conditions (mean %-weight loss per hour). B. nub-
ilis loses water at a slow, steady rate until approximately 15%
of its total water has been lost, at which time it dies. Al-
initialy
though B. glandula loses water faster than does the larger
B. tintinnabulum, it can withstand a loss of 25-35% whereas
up to about 30-40% of the total water content is lost in B.
intinnabulum. In all three specios sholl water loss is great-
est during the first few hours of exposure, but thereafter the
rate is markedly reduced (fig.3a). In general body water loss
is slight immediately following exposure, but then it increases
until shortly before death. The rate then levels off until
B. glandula has lost about 55% of its body weight at death,
B. tintinnabulum 35% and B. nubilis 15% (fig.4).
Lactic acid production
Fig.5 illustrates that the concentration of lactic acid
in all three species is low, however, there is a difference in
concentration of three orders of magnitude between the species
(fig.5a). B. nubilis and B. tintinnabulum showed a slight in-
crease after thirty-six hours of dessication in the field, with
a maximum lactic acid concentration of 3.Ox10M/g and 3.5110 M/g.
respectively, by the fourth day. After two days B. glandula in-
creased its lactic acid concentration to a maximum of 3.Ox10 2M/g.
By the fifth day a slight deorease in concentration was shown
in all three species.
In an additional experiment barnacles were subjected to
