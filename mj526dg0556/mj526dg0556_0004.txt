For the field experiment water loss measurements were ob-
tained by weighing the samples at the beginning of the experi-
ment and then twice daily over a period of a week. In contrast
the more severly dessicated laboratory animals were weighed be-
fore being put into the dossicator and then every two hours
over a period of forty-eight hours. Two to five animals of each
species were removed once daily (in the evening) from the field
experiment and every four hours in the case of the laboratory
experiment. After the animals had been weighed, the bodies of
each of the specimens were carefully separated from their shells
and individually weighed. The shells were then cleaned of lamal-
lae and opercular plates and they too were weighed. The total
water loss was taken as the ratio of the total weight after des-
sication to the initial total wet weight and expressed as a
mean percentage loss. The average wet body weight to wet total
weight was calculated for a series of wet control samples (fig.1).
Following dessication the body water loss was determined by
comparing the body weight after dessication to the average wet
body weight derived from the previously calculated ratios.
Shell water loss was calculated in a like manner.
In this study,the presence of lactic acid, a major end-
product of anaerobisis, was detected by a modified enzymatic
technique (cf. Bergmeyer, 1965). For each test a body sample
of known weight was homogenized in cold distilled water and
the homogenate was centrifuged for thirty minutes at 6500 R.P.M.,
at 0Â°C. The supernatant was then deproteinized with O.5ml. ZnSO
