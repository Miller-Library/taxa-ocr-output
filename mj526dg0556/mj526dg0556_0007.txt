the exception of a small, micropylar opening which forms be-
tweon the turgum and the scutum. After exposure of from three
to four days, however, the micropylar opening becomes grad-
ually smaller until by the sixth or seventh day it has almost
disappeared. The animal generally dies after a week of exposure.
The lower intertidal species, on the other hand, show no
adaptive responses to exposure and continue their normal cir-
ral pulsing. Most of the B. nubilis pulse at from four to
seven beats per minute, while those animals not beating remain
open with their valves slightly parted. By the third or fourth
day of exposure, the cirral pulse rate diminishes and most of
the animals withdraw back into their shells, closing the valves.
For the next few days there is only occasional cirral activity
until the animal dies (usually by the seventh day).
B. tintinnabulum is even more active than B. nubilis, pul-
sing from seven to twenty times per minute for the first few
days. Thereaftor the pulse rate lessens but rarely does the
animal ever stop its cirral beating. The pulsing becomes slow
and spasmodic and B. tintinnabulum eventually dies by the
fourth day of exposure, with its dried oirri still partially
extruded.
