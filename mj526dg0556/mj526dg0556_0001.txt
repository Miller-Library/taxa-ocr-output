INTRODUCTION
The cirripedes of the intertidal region are frequently
subjected to widely fluctuating environmental conditions which
can bring about dessication during tidal exposure. Barnes and
Barnes (1957) reported that littoral barnacles appear to have
a "controlled behavior" to cope with dessication, whereas sub-
littoral forms 'struggle upon exposure and soon become dessica-
ted.'
In Monterey Bay, California, three species of acorn barn-
acles are found which vary in size and vertical zonation. The
smallest of these, Balanus glandula, weighs from one to two
grams and is found intertidally from about two to ten feet
above mean lower low water (Doty, 1946). The other two species,
Balanus nubilis (weighing up to two hundred grams) and Balanus
intinnabulum (weighing to about twenty grams), are found in
lower intertidal regions, from about plus two feet to the sub-
littoral. The local ocourence of three species of the same ge-
nus which differ in size and inhabit distinctly different in-
tertidal zones provided an opportunity to make a comparative
study of the effects of dessication in relationship to tidal
height.
The barnacles Balanus glandula, B. tintinnabulum, and
B. nubilis were investigated with regard to three aspeots of
dessication; (1) the behavior of the animal upon exposure,
(2) the rate and percent of water loss from the whole animal,
