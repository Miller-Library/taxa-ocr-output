submergence in deoxygenated seawater for forty-eight hours.
Noincrease of lactic acid could be found in the lower inter-
tidal species, B. nubilis and B. tintinnabulum, whereas
B. glandula showed a small increase to 2.3x10"2 M/g.
Respiration
The normal respiratory rate for B. glandula was calculated
to be 180 ul 0/g/hr., while rates of 96 pl 0,/g/hr. and 260 pl 0,/g/hr.
were found for B. tintinnabulum and B. nubilis respectively.
After having been subjeoted to the deoxygenated water for eighteen
hours, the rate increased to 925 ul 0,/g/hr. for B. glandula
while B. tintinnabulum only increased its rate to 400 ul 0/g/hr.
and B. nubilis to 310 ul 0/g/hr. In comparing the rate of resp-
iration in water to that out of water, it was found that B. glan-
dula decreases its rate with increasing exposure. The rate was
the same for animals that had been freshly removed from the sea-
water but after six hours of exposure declined to 92 ul 0/g/hr.
and to 10 pl 0/g/hr. after thirty-six hours of dessication.
DISCUSSION
The micropylar opening seen to form when B. glandula was
exposed to dessication is similar to that which Barnes and Barnes (1957)
described in Balanus balanoides, but the pulsing of the micropy-
lar opening which was observed in the latter species was absent
in B. glandula. The two lower intertidal species studied, B. nub-
ilig and B. tintinnabulum, however, exhibited cirral pulsing even
under the conditions of severe dessication. As the ratio of ex-
