B. nubilis and B. tintinnabulum both died with no production
of lactio acid, On the other hand B. glandula lived and a slight
increase in lactic acid was demonstrated. This would imply
that B. glandula can perhaps metabolise food reserves in the
absence of oxygen, while tho two lower intertidal species
cancnot. This is further indicated in a study made by Augen-
feld (1967), who found that the level of stored glycogen in
the high intertidal B. glandula was two to three times greater
than similar stores in the lower intertidal species, such as B,
nubilis. Augenfold reported that the glycogen level was halved
in B. glandula and exhausted in B. nubilis after several days
of exposure. He also found a trace of lactic acid in B. glan-
dula while none was demonstrated in B. nubilis. However, Aug-
enfeld agreed with Barnes and Barnes (1957) in that he didn't
think that anaerobic respiration, if even present, was ever
significant as an adaptive mechanism to dessication.
Other marine organisms when placed under stress often
show the capability of being able to mako at least a partial
reversion to anaerobic respiration. For example, Mysa relicta
is normally found in water with an oxygen content of about
4ml. 0/1., but Thieneman (1928) found it partially utilising
anaerobisis in the depths of the Black Sea, where the oxygen
content is 1.6ml. 0/1. Likewise Kreps (1929) found the occurence
of an oxygen debt in the barnacle Balanus crenatus along with
partially oxidized anaerobic byproducts, while Dugal found an-
aerobic glycolysis in the clam Venus mercenaria.
