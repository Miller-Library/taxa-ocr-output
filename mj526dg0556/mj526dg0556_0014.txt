or it is affected by lack of food and it reverts at least
in part to anaerobio respiration. By the fourth to sixth day
of exposure most of the stored glycogen has been utilized
and after about a week, the animal dies from the combined
effects of dessication and possible starvation.
The story differs somewhat for the lower intertidal
species, B. nubilis and B. tintinnabulum. Upon exposure
they continue their cirral activity (this seems to be a
respiratory mechanism and also a possible feeding reflex).
Little water is lost during the first few hours, after which
time they are normally resubmerged. If the barnacles should
continue to be exposed, however, rapid dessication occurs.
These organisms apparently cannot get enough oxygen through
their dessicated respiratory surfaces and since their glycogen
supply is small, it is quickly exhausted and they die after
from four to seven days. The two lower intertidal forms exhibit
no adaptive characteristics to cope with dessication. The
high intertidal B. glandula has greater tolerance limits to
water loss and a respiratory mechanism which allows partial
reversion to anaerobisis.
