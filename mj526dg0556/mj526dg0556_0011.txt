lower intertidal species during exposure, though it may be an
important respiratory funotion, exposes the moist body parts and
thus hastens dessication. B. glandula is smaller than the other
two species and rapidly loses a large percentage of its body
water (fig.3b), however it appears to be able to tolerate this
loss, maintaining itself during prolonged exposure. The re-
sults of the rapid cirral activity of B. tintinnabulum is re-
flected in fig.2. This organism shows the greatest total water
loss, yet it can tolerate less body water loss than can the
smaller B. glandula (fig.4). On the other hand B. nubilis loses
the least amount of water, but this is prob√•bly a function of
its size and not of any adaptive characteristics. This was borne
out in a study that indicated that immature B. nubilis, of the
same size as B. glandula, could tolerate only two days of ex-
posure, whereas B. glandula could tolerate seven.
Shell water loss apparently occurs mainly by the evap-
oration of water from the shell surface and appears to be
of minimal importance. Body water loss, however, appears to be
of great significance in determining the survival of intertidal
barnacles (cf. fig.4). It is interesting to compare the result
of Edney's (1967) investigation of the desert cockroach, Arnev-
igo sp.,under xeric conditions to the results obtained in this
study. The cockroach can tolerate a loss of from 25-30% of its
body water,before it dies, whereas the intertidal barnacles
studied can tolerate a 15-50% loss, depending on the species,
before death ensues. The observations of this study therefore
agree with those of Suzuki and Mori (1963), who stated that
