the body, and from the shell, and (3) the respiration rate
of barnacles during periods of exposure.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Specimans of B. glandula were removed intact from their
granite substrate with a scalpel. Excess water was blotted
off and each animal was weighed to the nearest milligram on a
Mettler balance. Specimans of B. nubilis from wharf pilings
and B. tintinnabulum removed from a float in the bay were
collected and each weighed to the nearest O.1 gram. All speci-
mans were numbered and put in a saltwater aquarium at 13Â°0.
until needed.
To observe the offeot of dessication under field cond-
itions, a screened-over, open-sided box was placed in the
intertidal, just above the highwater mark. Weighed and number-
ed animals of all three species were placed in this "natural
dessicator" and were subsequently sampled over a period of
seven days. Since wide variations in temperature and humidity
occured during this experiment, a similar artificial dessica-
tion experiment was conducted in the laboratory under more
controlled conditions. Samples were placed in a commeroial
dessicator (Drierite was used as a dessicant) for forty-eight
hours at room temperature. The system was flushed by a cont-
inuous stream of air run into the dessicator through a tube of
calcium chloride. The behavior which the barnacles demonstrated
was noted periodically through these experiments.
