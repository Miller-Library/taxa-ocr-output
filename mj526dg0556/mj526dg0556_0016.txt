total weight of the barnaole.
fig.2b. mean-% of total weight loss under natural
conditions.
fig.2b. mean-% of total weight loss under laboratory
conditions.
fig.3a. mean-% of shell water loss under laboratory
oonditions.
fig.3b. mean-% of body water loss under laboratory
conditions
fig.4. average-% of weight loss at death (of 50%
of the animals).
fig.5a. relative magnitudes of laotic acid concentration
in the three speies.
fig.5b. increase in lactic acid under natural conditions.
fig.6. increase in respiration after eighteen hours in
