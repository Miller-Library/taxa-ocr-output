tolerance of body water loss was most significant in deter-
ming the adaptation of an intertidal barnacle to exposure.
The respiratory rates observed in this study are comparable
to those reported for other species of barnacles. Barnes and
Barnes (1959) found a rate of from 140 pl 0/g/hr. to 160 ul 0/g/hr.
in B. glandula and a rate of from 94 ul 0/g/hr. was found for
Balanus amphitrite communis by Ganapati and Rao (1960). The
large increase in the respiratory rate of B. glandula after
exposure to deoxygenated seawater was somewhat surprising, how-
ever Lund (1921) reported an increased rate in Planaria agilis
of about 85% under similar conditions. He also found that the
greatest increase occured after starvation. As filtered sea-
water was utilized in this study starvation might also have been
a factor in the large respiratory increase of B. glandula. In
any oase it would appear that B. glandula had accumulated an
oxygen dobt after having been subjected to essentially an-
aerobic conditions. There were also indications of similar
but much reduced oxygen debts in B. nubilis and B. tintin-
nabulum. B. glandula, which exhibited the greatest increase
in respiration following anaerobic conditions, also showed the
greatest lactic acid concentration, while both B. tintinnabulum
and B. nubilis had smaller lactic acid concentrations and
lesser oxygen debts.
The pattern of oxygen consumption and lactic acid con-
centration refered to above was emphasized by leaving the barn-
acles in deoxygenated seawater for forty-eight hours.
