placed in the dark. After the barnacles had been exposed for
eighteen hours to these essentially anaerobic conditions, the
deoxygenated water was drained off and carefully replaced
with filtered seawater of a known oxygen concentration. After
two hours the rospiratory rate in the latter solution was cal-
culated and compared to the initially established rate to
see if there had been an increase which might imply that an
oxygen debt had been accumulated.
In addition the respiratory rates of B. glandula out of
water and in water were determined on a WARBURG respirometer.
(cf. Umbrett, Burris, and Stauffer, 1964). Four specimens were
put into 18ml. manometric flasks with jml. of filtered seawater
at 15Â°0. O.2ml. of a 20% KOH solution was placed in the center
vessel of the reaction flasks to absorb C0,. Four animals
that had been freshly removed from seawater were placed in a
similar flask without any water and the respiratory rates com-
pared. The experiment was repeated after the latter sample
had been exposed to air at 15'0. for six hours, and again after
it had been dessicated for thirty-six hours.
OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS
Behavior
Under natural conditions the behavioral responses of the
three species of Balanus to exposure and dessication differ
markedly. The high intertidal B. glandula ceases all cirral
activity immediately upon exposure. The operculum closes with
-5-
20.
