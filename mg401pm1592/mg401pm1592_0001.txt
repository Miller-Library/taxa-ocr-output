There have been relatively few reports of success¬
ful in vitro rearing of barnacle larvae to the settled
cyprid stage. Within the last decade cypris larvae of
Balanus eburneus and Balanus amphitrite denticulata
have been raised on a diet of Chlamydomonas sp. and
rbacia eggs (Costlow and Bookhout, 1957, 1958). Full
development of Balanus balanus larvae was accomplished
on the diatom Skeletonema costatum, both alone and mixed
with the diatoms Biddulohia regia, Ditylum brightwellii,
and Phaeodactylum cornutum (Barnes and Costlow, 1961).
Recently, several of 17 unicellular algae were used suc¬
cessfully in rearing cypris larvae of Balanus balanoides,
Elminius modestus, Chthamalus stellatus and Lepas anati-
fera (see Moyse, 1963). For a review of earlier work
see Costlow and Bookhout (1957). The present study re¬
presents an attempt to assess the usefulness of four spé¬
cies of unicellular green algae and two species of diatoms
as food in rearing Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli.
For each food species the following questions were posed.
Do the barnacles ingest it? Do they digest it? How long
do they survive on it? And does it support growth and
development of successive larval instars?
The study waspursued at the Hopkins Marine Station
of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California between
May 1 and June 5, 1967. The algae employed as foods for
the nauplii, supplied from the culture collection at the
Marine Station, were Platymonas sp., Dunaliella viridis,
Chlorella sp., Stichococcus sp., Nitzschia closterium,
and Nitzschia closterium minutissima. Balanus glandula
and Chthamalus dalli were collected in the Monterey Penin-
sula area. Mature ovigerous lamellae were removed from
the mantle cavity and transferred immediately to a glass
container of millipore filtered sea water where time was
allowed for hatching. In collecting for experimental use
