tichococous used here is not digested by Artemia salina,
and Moyse (1963) found that Chlorella stigmatophora will
not promote growth in nauplii of Balanus balanoides,
Elminius modestus and Chthamalus stellatus beyond the
second instar.
SUMMARY
(1) It was found that Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli
ingested four unicellular green algae (Platymonas sp.
StiÂ¬
chococcus sp., Chlorella sp., and Dunaliella viridis)
and two diatoms (Nitzschia closterium and Nitzschia
closterium minutissima).
(2) Nauplii of both barnacle species survive longest on
Piatymonas.
(3) Greatest growth and development for both naupliar
species was provided by a Platymonas diet. Chlorella and
tichococcus do not promote larval growth.
