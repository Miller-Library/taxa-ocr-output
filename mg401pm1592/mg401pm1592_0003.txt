glandula larvae were gained by examining naupliar fecal
pellets. Feces formed by nauplii feeding on Chlorella
were impregnated with intact green algal cells which showed
no evidences of digestion. Undigested algae were never
detected in fecal pellets produced by nauplii feeding on
latymonas, Dunaliella, and Nitzschia spp.
Whether or
not Stichococcus is digested by the larvae remains un-
certain.
SURVIVAL
Two experiments were conducted to compare the sur-
vival times of B. glandula larvae fed on different algae.
In the first experiment thirteen 50 ml. Erlenmeyer
flasks were used. To each vessel 5 ml. of millipore fil-
tered sea water and 20 nauplii were added. To each pair
of flasks one of the six algal suspensions was added.
The odd flask served as a starved control. The cultures
were maintained at 12-14Â°0. under constant agitation on
a sliding platform. The number of surviving nauplii was
determined periodically by concentrating the larvae with
a strong light and counting them. The results of this
experiment are found in fig. 1.
A second experiment employed a modified version of
the culturing technique of Moyse (1960). Each of twenty-
five 600 ml. beakers containing 475ml. of millipore fil-
tered sea water received 120 nauplii in stages I and II.
Before the algae were added to the naupliar cultures, each
algal suspension was filtered through a nylon mesh screen
to segregate cell aggregations as much as possible. The
screen pore sizes utilized to filter particular algae
were as follows: Nitzschia spp., 250; Platymonas, 154;
all other species, 104. The density for each algal sus-
pension was then determined on a Coulter Electronic Par-
ticle Counter. The beakers of larvae were divided into
groups of four, each group receiving one of the six foods
