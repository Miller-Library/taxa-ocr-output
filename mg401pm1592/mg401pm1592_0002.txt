the larvae were first swirled in the hatching beaker to
disperse them; they were then withdrawn with a Pasteur
pipette, counted, and added to the culture vessels. Fur-
ther details are given in the appropriate sections below.
Assistance in the identification of the various nau-
pliar stages was provided by John B. Snodgrass. Thanks
are extended to Dr. Donald P. Abbott for his advice dur-
ing the study.
FEEDING AND DIGESTION
Due to the wide variation in size, shape, and mo-
tility of the algae, there was a question as to whether
all six foods could be captured and ingested by the lar-
vae. In two separate preliminary experiments B. glandula
and C. dalli nauplii, taken 0-30 minutes after hatching,
were placed in individual cultures of the six foods. In
approximately 30 minutes the larvae were removed and ex-
amined microscopically for changes in digestive tract
contents. In both experiments approximately equal pro-
portions of first and second instar (stage I and II)
nauplii were observed. Several stage II nauplii that had
ingested food were found in all the algal cultures.
Feeding was confirmed by observation of intact or frag-
mented algae inside the digestive tract, or by noting a
conspicuous color change in the gut. No indication of
feeding was ever noted in a first stage nauplius of
either barnacle species. This supports the observation
of Lochhead (1936) and others that barnacle nauplii pass
into the second stage without feeding. In all later ex-
periments, larvae of both barnacle species were found to
ingest the algal or diatom species provided for them.
While the larvae were usually actively swimming when ob-
served, they appeared at times to graze on the algal cells
adhering to the walls and floors of the culture containers.
