with 40 larvae and maintained at 12-14°0. Key
to the seven different lines: a - Platymonas sp.,
b = Nitzschia closterium, c = Nitzschia closterium
minutissima, d - Dunaliella viridis, e - Sticho-
coccus sp., f = Chlorella sp., g - starved control.

ferent food organisms. All cultures were started
with 120 larvae and maintained at 16.5-17.5°0.
For identification of the lines refer to fig. 1
caption. In a starved control two stage II larvae
were living after 7.9 days.

ferent food organisms. All cultures were started
with 80 larvae and maintained at 2112'0. For
identification of the lines refer to fig. 1 caption.
Starved controls were dead by the 4- day.

different food organisms. The first three sets
of cultures (i.e. those observed after 2.3 days,
4.1 days, and 6.5 days) were started with 80 lar-
vae each and were maintained at room temperature
1t2'C). The cultures observed after 11.7 days
and 14.8 days were started with 120 larvae each
and were maintained at room temperature for two
days and then at 16.5-17.5°0 for the remainder
