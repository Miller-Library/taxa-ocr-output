cultures where Platymonas formed the diet. Only a few
stage III (and one stage IV) nauplii were found in lar-
val cultures feeding on N. closterium and N. closterium
inutissima, although in a similar experiment performed
t room temperature (20-24Â°C) third and fourth stages
were achieved on these same nutrients in 2.5 days before
death occurred. Dead nauplii in these and all other cul-
tures were examined to see whether a substantial number
of later stage larvae were present; they were not.
Results showing growth of C. dalli maintained on
different diets are shown in fig. 5. The same criteria
were applied in differentiating the various stages, but
here distinctions as to which criterion was utilized are
indicated in the graph. The blackened areas of each bar
indicate those larvae classified on the basis of their
first appendage, whereas the stippled zones represent
arvae classified according to body size and shape of
tail. Although the latter two criteria are considered
less reliable indicators of instar than the first an-
tenna, it is felt that the error introduced through their
use is negligible.
The development of the larvae of C. dalli on the
various foods correlates closely with its survival time
on these foods (fig. 3). Larvae cultured with Platymonas
were successfully reared to the cyprid settling stage. The
majority of the cyprids had settled when they were ex-
tracted from the culture. Although larvae did not pass
beyond stage III when feeding on N. closterium and not
beyond stage IV when feeding on Dunaliella, the results
suggest that these food organisms provide at least some
of the requirements for growth.
No growth occurred in cultures fed on Chlorella or
Stichococcus. Others have reported parallel results.
