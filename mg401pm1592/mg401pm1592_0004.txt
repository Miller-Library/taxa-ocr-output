added in an amount calculated to provide an initial con-
centration of 3000 particles per ml. One beaker was set
aside as a starved control. All cultures were maintained
between 16.5 to 17.5°0. Every two days a beaker from
each group was selected; all surviving nauplii in it were
extracted, mounted on slides, and counted. The results
are shown in fig. 2.
In both experiments mortality was highest. in nau-
plius cultures to which Stichococcus or Chlorella had
been added. Survival was best in cultures containing
Platymonas. The other microorganisms gave intermediate
results and fall in the following descending order: N.
closterium, N. closterium minutissima, Dunaliella.
An experiment to determine duration of survival of
C. dalli on each of the same six food organisms was con-
ducted similarly, except that larvae were maintained in
plastic boxes at room temperature (2112'0). In many re¬
spects the results obtained (fig. 3) were similar. Survival was
greatest in cultures containing Platymonas. Nauplii fed
with Dunaliella and Nitzschia closterium survived in
receiyi

greater numbers than
coccus, or Nitzschia closterium minutissima.
GROWTH
The experiments described above were designed to
vield data on growth as well as survival times. Growth
was assessed by counting the number of living nauplii of
each instar which were presentat each observation. Nau¬
liar stages were identified using characters determined
for thesespecies by Snodgrass (1967). Primary use was
made of the setation formula of the first appendage;
when this appendage could not be seen clearly, the de¬
termination of stage was made on the basis of body size
and the shape of the tail components.
As fig. 4 indicates, the only pronounced progression
of B. glandula larvae into the later instars was found in
