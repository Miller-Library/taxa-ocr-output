SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL
STEADY STATE RATES OF OXYGEN ADDITION AND DEFLETION
UNIFOEM MIXING OF TIDEFOOL
UNIFOEM OXYGEN DEFLETION FATES AMONG ALL INVERTEEFATE SFECIES
UNIFOEM OXYGEN DEFLETION RATES AMONG ALL FISH EFECIES
UNIFOEM OXYGEN DEFLETION FATES AMONG ALL SFECIES OF ALGAE
UNIFOEM OXYGEN ADDITION RATES AMOMG ALL SFECIES OF ALGAE
OXYGEN CONSUMFTION RATES INCREASE WITH OXYGEN CONCENTRATION
ALL INVERTEBRATES STAY IN FOOL FOR DURATION OF LOW TIDE
COMSTANT TEMPERATURE OF 15-17 DEGREES C
MICROBIAL ACTIVITY HAS NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT
OXYGEN DIFFUSION TO ATMOSPHERE DUE TO SUFEF-SATUFATION
IS CONTRIBUTING TO DEPLETION AT HIGHER OXYGEN LEVELS
