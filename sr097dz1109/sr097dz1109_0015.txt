DISCUSSION
The relationship of oxygen levels to pH and temperature in
the field tidepool readings was striking. However, it would be a
mistake to conclude that a causal relationship exists, for
instance, between pH and oxygen levels in the tidepools simply
because they correlate significantly. One hypothesis regarding
this correlation is that a third input is controlling both
parameters separately. According to this hypothesis, the
photosynthesis-respiration exchange of CO, and O, gases is
responsible:
« PHOTOSYNT. (DAY)
(NIGHT) RESPIR.
0 + C(H,O) «= H,O + CO «=» HCO3-+ H+
In this way, when oxygen levels are high due to photosynthetic
activity, carbon is being fixed in the algae, depleting ambient
carbon dioxide stores, pulling overall equilibrium to the left of
the equation, lowering H" concentrations and making the solution
less acidic - the trend seen in the field and in the laboratory
(See Fig. 6).
Similarly, the correlation between oxygen and temperature
depicted in Fig. 7 can be viewed as an influence of one outside
factor upon two independent physico-chemical parameters. Solar
irradiation causes water temperature to rise, and it also causes
dissolved oxygen to rise due to its photosynthetic effect.
The discrepancies between predicted and actual values of
oxygen depicted in Figs. 10-12 are minor, but significant enough
to merit further development of the model. More importantly, the
model yet fails to predict the afternoon leveling effect
aforementioned. In this way, the model helps to point out what
