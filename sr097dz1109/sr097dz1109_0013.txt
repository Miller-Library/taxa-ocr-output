about solar noon on.
The phytoplankton biomasses determined for the sample
tidepools were very low compared to their algal biomasses. The
average value found was 0.227 mg chlorophyll per pool - hardly
significant compared to the amount of macrophytic chlorophyll in
any given pool (over 500 g).
Manipulations of the model led to some interesting results
(see Table 3). Neither removal of fish nor addition (up
to the highest biomass found in the 16 sample tidepools) resulted
in any significant changes in oxygen levels. The most significant
results occurred when half the algal biomass was removed,
indicating the importance of algae in terms of affecting both
oxygen addition and depletion. Daylength was also found to be
important in determining oxygen concentrations. All other factors
held constant, the same pool during the second week of December
had oxygen levels decline further than in June because of the
longer night.
A tendency for Tegula to migrate above the waterline of
pools at night was noted during diurnal surveys. Pachygrapsus
crabs also enter and exit the pools often. These phenomena were
observed in Tidepool 4, which contained 145g of snails and crabs.
Removing these animals from the pool would hence mimic their
migratory behavior. However, when this was done in a model
simulation, the oxygen still fell to about the same level as when
the snails and crabs were present.
An upcast heap of Macrocystis came to rest in the trench of
Tidepool 4 during mid-May for about a week, until another high
tide carried it away again. Toward the end of its stay it was
