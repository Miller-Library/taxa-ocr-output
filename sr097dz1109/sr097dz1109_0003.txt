factors comprises the focus of this investigation.
Here a computer simulation model is constructed to elucidate
factors controlling oxygen levels and the relative significances
of their control. Models are observer-defined abstractions of the
real world, and though they may only approximate what is
happening in an ecosystem, they can be valuable research tools
for a number of reasons (Wetzel and Wiegert, 1983). First of all,
they provide an easy way to "manipulate" the environment without
causing damage, and may be used to forecast potentially harmful
impacts of a questionable environmental alteration. Additionally,
a model can condense years into minutes, further assisting in the
long-term prediction of impacts. Models also determine sensitive
or controlling parameters and may be used to identify areas where
information is lacking or inadequate. These characteristics point
to computer modeling as a sound research vehicle for this
investigation into what factors, biological or physical,
determine ambient oxygen levels in tidepools.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We identified sixteen tidepools on the coastline of Hopkins
Marine Station, located on the southern end of Monterey Bay, as
feasible potential study sites. Factors which went into
determining feasibility included size (less than one square meter
surface area), elevation (less than two meters above MLLW), and
separation from any interconnected pool networks. Each pool was
numbered and marked with surveyor's tape glued to the rock.
Tidepool surface areas were determined by approximating the
surface as a combination of triangles and rectangles. Volumes
