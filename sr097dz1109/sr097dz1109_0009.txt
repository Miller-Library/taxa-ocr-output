To test the model, characteristics of real tidepools had to
be determined, for example the biomass of different groups of
organisms. Each of the sixteen sample tidepools were censused for
fish biomass.
To estimate invertebrate biomass I collected average-sized
individuals of different species found in the pools (e.g.,
Tegula, Anthopleura, etc.). The weights of these individuals were
recorded and used to convert the number of individuals to
biomass. I counted individuals of the different species in each
test pool.
Two types of healthy algal biomass had to be estimated in
the test pools: foliose and crustose. To estimate foliose
biomass, I collected fronds of algal species found in the test
pools, weighed them for reference, and counted the number of
similar-sized fronds found in the pools. I repeated this
procedure for the determination of necrotic algal biomass. I
collected samples of crustose algae (e.g., corallines, HildenÂ¬
brandia spp.) by hammer and chisel and measured the area of the
larger pieces. The weights of these pieces were determined, and
an area:biomass conversion factor was developed. Exposed area of
crustose algae was determined in each test pool, and estimates of
biomass were derived from these values.
Phytoplankton content of each of the sixteen sample
tidepools was determined by spectrophotometric analysis for
chlorophyll in the sample water. This survey was performed to
determine whether enough phytoplankton biomass was present to
affect net oxygen addition in the pools.
The model parameters were fine-tuned by using Tidepool 3
