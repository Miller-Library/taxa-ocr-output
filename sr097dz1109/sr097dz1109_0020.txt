Figure 1: Oxygen field readings conducted over a diurnal cycle on
5/31/89 and 6/4/89. This graph demonstrates the fluctuations of
oxygen found in tidepools relative to the ocean, variations among
tidepools in oxygen concentration, and the afternoon leveling
effect unaccounted for by the simulation model.
Figure 2: Temperature field readings conducted over a diurnal
cycle on 5/31/89 and 6/4/89. This graph shows temperature
fluctuations found in tidepools during the day which exceed any
temperature extremes found in the ocean.
Figure 3: Local topography of the three model test pools. All
three sketches are views from the south-south west. These
sketches demonstrate how topography can affect the amount of
diffuse sunlight that may irradiate a tidepool.
Figure 4: Schematic of the computer simulation model. Dashed
boxes indicate factors not accounted for in the model. Large
rectangles indicate biological oxygen sources and sinks.
Triangles depict ambient oxygen concentration.

output to solar irradiance (Denny, 1989).
