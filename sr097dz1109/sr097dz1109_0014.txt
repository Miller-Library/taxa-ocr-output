emitting a strong odor, and no fish were noticeable in the pool.
Addition of 1000g necrotic algae (probably a gross underestimate
of actual levels) into the modeled pool resulted in a decline to
zero ppm oxygen 1 1/2 hours after separation from the ocean, not
gaining any oxygen until the next high tide. This simulation
points to drifting necrotic algae as a potential factor
controlling tidepool oxygen concentrations.
Tidepool 7 is largely encrusted by coralline algae
(estimated 1357.6g of 2041.8g total algae present there).
Simulation of a specific parasite which kills off all the
coralline algae, assuming no necrotic oxygen utilization, results
in oxygen levels significantly higher at dawn and significantly
lower at the next high tide (see Table 3). This simulation once
more demonstrates how important algae are to tidepool oxygen
depletion as well as addition.
Simulation of the removal of a large rock wall from the east
side of Tidepool 7 yielded predictions of oxygen levels which
differed significantly from levels with an intact wall present.
This alteration transforms the semi-trench pool into an open
pool, and allows direct sunlight to reach the pool about an hour
earlier. The higher oxygen levels experienced in the morning
without the rock wall demonstrate the importance of local
topography in determining oxygen concentrations during the day.
