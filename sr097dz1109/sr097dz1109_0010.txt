model input values. The diffuse sunlight coefficient of 0.178
umole 0/(g X hr.) was adjusted to 0.070 to provide for a tighter
fit to the field data. This adjustment indicates that
experimental conditions for the determination of algal oxygen
addition did not accurately mimic actual diffuse solar irradiance
occurring in the tidepools. The diffuse sunlight coefficient for
a semi-trench pool determined in the algal oxygen addition
experiment was approximately half that of the open pool [0.083
umole 0/ (g X hr.)], and this value was adjusted to 0.037,
using the same scale above. Once the model predicted oxygen
levels close to actual field levels along the time course of a
low tide in Tidepool 3 it was tested with the specified values
for Tidepools 4 and 7 for validation.
As soon as the model had achieved some degree of accuracy
with regard to all three test pools, model inputs were
manipulated to simulate changes in the tidepool ecosystem, and
predicted impacts on the oxygen levels were noted. Examples of
such manipulations include the removal or addition of fish,
removal of half the invertebrates or algae, and the addition of
drifting necrotic algae.
RESULTS
Linear regression analysis of 58 simultaneous oxygen and pH
readings yielded a product-moment correlation coefficient of
r=.932, which at 56 degrees of freedom is significant to the
Pe.O01 level. This highly significant correlation allowed for the
formulation of a linear equation predicting pH levels at any
