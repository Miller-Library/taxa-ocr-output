groups of organisms. Algae at 25°C showed a greater depletion rate
than algae at 15°C. The initial steep slopes of the lines in Fig.
8 demonstrate what appears to be a dependency of depletion rate
on ambient oxygen levels. A sample calculation of this dependency
is given in Appendix 1. Only necrotic algae continued to deplete
oxygen linearly with time at oxygen levels less than 3 ppm.
Oxygen depletion constants for each group of organisms are listed
in Table 4 on a per-mass basis.
The two-hour algal oxygen addition experiments yielded
linear addition rates at all levels of sunlight exposure (see
Fig. 9). The calculation of addition coefficients (in umole o,/Ig X
hrj) with respect to exposure type was straightforward and is
presented in Appendix 2.
Field values of fish biomass and estimates of invertebrate
and algal biomass in the three model test pools (3,4,7) are
listed in Table 2. Other model inputs are also listed therein.
When entered into the model, these values lead to predictions
that follow actual field readings quite closely during the night
and morning (Figs. 10, 11, 12). However, during the afternoon,
the model continues to rapidly add oxygen due to photosynthesis,
while field values for tidepool oxygen show a tendency to level
off (See Fig. 1 to note this leveling effect). Increasing the
mass-flux coefficient, K, helps to dampen the model's erroneous
afternoon oxygen climb, but it also dampens the morning oxygen
rise which otherwise fits rather closely to the field readings.
Hence the model in its present form seems to predict night to
morning levels with some accuracy, but loses its usefulness from
