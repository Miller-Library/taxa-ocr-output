information is lacking or inadequate, as some mechanism after
solar noon is either enhancing oxygen depletion or stemming algal
oxygen production. To fine tune the model further, one needs to
consider the fundamental assumptions of the model in its current
form. Some assumptions are listed in Table 5. The assumption that
temperature remains constant at lab conditions of 15-17Â°c is
invalid for tidepools, as demonstrated by the field data. Further
investigations into temperature effects on oxygen depletion rates
of the different groups of organisms could perhaps yield insight
into the afternoon leveling effect. For instance, Table 4 reveals
a clear positive correlation of algal oxygen consumption with
temperature.
Additionally, oxygen depletion was found to be dependent on
ambient oxygen levels, but the experiment that provided this
information was conducted at oxygen levels of 0-10 ppm with
readings taken every 3 hours, and therefore did not provide a
complete picture of ambient oxygen effects on depletion rates in
the tidepools (no readings above 10 ppm, regularly exceeded in my
tidepools). To obtain a more accurate picture of these effects,
an experiment could be conducted that began at levels of 25-30
ppm, with readings taken every 1/2 hour, which would offer better
estimates of instantaneous oxygen depletion rate per ambient
oxygen concentration.
The model also assumes uniform mixing in tidepools, which
may or may not be the case in different situations. The tidepool
mixing experiment showed that pool shape and air turbulence can
affect overall mixing rates. Field readings performed early in
