dividing distance by the time recorded in all directions. These
values were added and then divided by the number of readings to
arrive at an estimate of average THMV.
To establish oxygen depletion rates for the simulation
model, rates of oxygen depletion by the different groups of
organisms were determined in the lab. About 100g of fish and
600g of invertebrates (e.g. crabs, snails, anenomes, urchins)
were captured and brought to the lab. I bubbled carbon dioxide
into an unmarked tidepool to facilitate fish capture. The
invertebrate species were sampled in roughly the same ratio as
seen in the tidepools. About 500g of healthy algae was collected
from the intertidal zone at low tide, mostly composed of species
found in the sample tidepools, and it was divided into two
samples. About 300g of upcast necrotic (rotting) algae was
collected from the West Beach of Hopkins Marine Station. Total
biomass of the fish, invertebrates, necrotic algae, and the two
samples of healthy algae were determined on a Mettler 1 kg
balance. The number of each kind of fish and invertebrate species
was recorded (Note: the calcium carbonate or chitin exoskeletons
of the invertebrates were included in the measurement of
biomass).
Seven aquaria were prepared for the experiment by filling
each with 20 liters of sea water and nothing else. They were
situated away from direct sunlight, and the algae tanks were
covered with black plastic to prevent photosynthesis from
occurring. I took oxygen and temperature readings as well as
samples for pH and salinity determination before loading any of
the groups of organisms into their respective aquaria. Using an
