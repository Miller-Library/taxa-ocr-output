oxygen and pH readings (n=58) from the field and the lab showing
the strong correlation used to derive the pH predictive capacity
of the computer program.
Figure 7: Scatter plot and linear regression of simultaneous
oxygen and temperature field readings (n=69), indicating a strong
correlation.

Rates of depletion are listed in Table 4 on a per-mass basis.

irradiance.
Figure 10: Model test run on the calibration pool, Tidepool 3 (an
open pool), conducted over a low tide beginning in the middle of
the night and extending through to late morning.
Figure 11: Model test run on a validation pool, Tidepool 4 (a
trench pool), conducted over the same low tide as Tidepool 3.
Figure 12: Model test run on a validation pool, Tidepool 7 (a
semi-trench pool), conducted over the same low tide as the others.
