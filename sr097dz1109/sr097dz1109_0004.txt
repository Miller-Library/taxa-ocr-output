were estimated by removal and measurement of the tidepool water.
We determined each tidepool's elevation above MLLW through the
use of a surveyor's transit.
Extensive field measurements were made for six randomly
chosen pools. I measured dissolved oxygen and temperature on site
with a Yellow Springs Instruments Model 54 oxygen meter, and
samples were taken and removed to the lab for determination of pH
and salinity. The readings spanned three days and nights, and
were obtained at high and low tides and at midpoints between
tides. These measurements were designed to identify any
correlations between tidepool physico-chemical parameters. I
calculated linear regressions of oxygen against corresponding
temperature readings (n=69) and pH readings (n=58) to note
whether such correlations existed.
An experiment was conducted to determine the degree of
mixing that takes place in a tidepool. The experiment was carried
out on a single oval-shaped tidepool on a calm day (wind speed =
0-5 mph) and on a windy day (w.s. - 15-20 mph) to note whether
air turbulence affects mixing. I performed the experiment on a
horseshoe-shaped pool as well to determine the effect of pool
shape on mixing. A wire grid marked off in inches was placed over
the tidepools and anchored against the rocks. I gently pipeted
1/2 ml of a 1 g/1 solution of fluorescein dye into the tidepool
at the center of the grid, starting the stopwatch simultaneously,
I recorded the time elapsed when dye crossed the marked lines on
the grid in the north, south, east, and west directions. Average
tidepool horizontal mixing velocity (THMV) was then determined by
