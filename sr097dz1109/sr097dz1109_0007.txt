receive. A third aquarium was lined with plastic to the level
where the algae resting on the bottom barely showed above the
plastic line, thus imitating diffuse sunlight exposure in an open
pool. A fourth aquarium was lined at a level in between the two
prior plastic levels, approximating the amount of diffuse
sunlight a semi-trench pool would receive. The latter two aquaria
were also placed in a fully shaded area.
All four aquaria were filled with 20 liters of filtered sea
water and initial oxygen levels were recorded. The collected
algae were divided into four samples, each of which was weighed
and loaded into one of the four prepared aquaria. Oxygen
readings were made at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes.
Oxygen addition rates were calculated in umole O/(g biomassX
hour) for each of the four conditions represented by the
experimental aquaria (See Appendix 2).
To provide field data to test the oxygen model against, and
to demonstrate the stresses that the tidepool ecosystem must
endure, I took hourly oxygen and temperature readings from three
sample tidepools and from the ocean off Agassiz Beach, Hopkins
Marine Station. One of these pools, Tidepool 3, represented an
open pool, while #4 and #7 represented a trench pool and a semiÂ¬
trench pool, respectively (See Fig. 3). These hourly readings,
taken on three separate days, combined to form one diurnal cycle.
The weather was virtually identical on the three days - sunny and
clear - and the readings fit together smoothly (See Figs. 1 and
2).
Before modeling oxygen flux, oxygen sources, sinks, and
pathways had to be clearly defined. A tidepool oxygen model
