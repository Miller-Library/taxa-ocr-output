schematic was constructed for this purpose (See Fig. 4). Data
from the oxygen depletion and addition experiments provided
values to be assigned to the arrows in the diagram. The
dependency of various fluxes on the ambient oxygen level itself
implied by the data - is depicted in the schematic in the form of
dashed-line informational controls, and was entered into the
computer program within the flux equations (See Appendices 1 and
4). Oxygen addition rates were assumed to be dependent upon solar
irradiance, which can be modeled as:
L = Lmax X SIN(/daylength X time of day)
Since photosynthetic rates do not increase linearly with
irradiance, but rather in a fashion described in Fig. 5, oxygen
addition was assumed to ascend during the morning (and descend
during the evening) proportionally to the square root of the
sine, which seems to accurately model the increase in oxygen levels
observed during early morning in directly sunlit pools (See Fig.
10).
I introduced an ad hoc equation for diffusion of oxygen to
the atmosphere at levels above supersaturation (28 ppm):
Rate = (K) (Surface Area) ([0) - 7.966)
((o) in uM/1, S.A. in sq. m)
Such a development in the model can necessitate additional model
inputs - in this example, tidepool surface area. A full listing
of the oxygen model inputs can be found in Table 1. Note that the
times of sunrise and sunset are necessary inputs to define the
daylength, and subsequently influence oxygen addition in the
model.
