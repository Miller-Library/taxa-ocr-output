diurnal field readings and biomass data for more tidepools would
be necessary to adequately test and tune the model. One can be
confident in a model's predictive power only when the model is
tested in such a rigorous manner.
In spite of the many shortcomings of the model, some
conclusions could be drawn. The simulations pointed to algae as
the most important controlling factor in terms of both oxygen
addition and depletion. Additionally, the model suggests that
fish play an insignificant role in affecting ambient oxygen
levels in tidepools off of Hopkins Marine Station. These two
findings appear to be fundamentally derived from the biomass of
the groups of organisms present in tidepools as opposed to their
depletion rate per biomass, as fish certainly consume more oxygen
per time per biomass than algae, but the typical tidepool
contains so much more algal biomass, as shown in Table 2, that
the net depletion due to fish is insignificant.
Manipulating the model also helped to show the importance of
other factors in determining tidepool oxygen levels, such as
daylength, local topography, and random ecological events such
as upcast drifting necrotic algae. The next logical
step would be to remove half of the algae in one of the test
pools to see if oxygen levels are really affected in the way the
model predicts.
