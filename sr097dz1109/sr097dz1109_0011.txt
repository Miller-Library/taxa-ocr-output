given oxygen concentration (in ppm):
pH = 7.34434 + 0.093187 X [01
In the computer program, predicted oxygen levels are converted
into an estimation of pH using the above equation along with 953
confidence limits. The derivation of these limits comprises
Appendix 3. See also Fig. 6.
Oxygen and temperature were also found to be significantly
correlated, but not as directly (See Fig. 7). High oxygen
concentrations correspond to high temperature, however, which
goes against the physical relationship between the two
parameters, whereby oxygen is less soluble in water at higher
temperatures. Salinity was found to be uniform throughout the
tidepools.
The tidepool mixing experiment yielded higher average
horizontal mixing velocities during windy days compared to calm
days: 0.0556 inches/second compared to 0.0308 ips. During the
windy day test, the dye was untrackably dilute after about four
minutes, whereas the dye on the calm day could be tracked for 6-8
minutes. Additionally, on the windy day, fluorescein was
distributed evenly over the oval-shaped pool (t7) while in a
horseshoe-shaped pool (+3) the dye tended to drift toward one
end.
Oxygen depletion rates by fish, invertebrates, and algae are
depicted in Fig. 8, as are the weights of each group observed.
The fish consumed about as much oxygen per time as the other
groups, even though much less biomass was present. The control
tank showed no net depletion, so microorganisms were assumed to
have negligible effects upon oxygen levels compared to the other
