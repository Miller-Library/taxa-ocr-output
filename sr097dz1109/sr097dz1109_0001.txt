ABSTRACT
Rates of oxygen depletion per biomass were determined
separately for four groups of organisms: fish, invertebrates,
healthy algae, and necrotic algae. Rates of oxygen addition per
biomass were determined for healthy algae at varying degrees of
solar irradiance. These rates were incorporated into a computer
program and used to predict oxygen levels in tidepools with known
amounts of biomass of the above groups of organisms. The model
was calibrated using input values from one pool, and tested using
values from two other pools. The model predicted oxygen levels
reasonably close to actual field values for night depletion and
morning addition, but predicted a continuous rise in tidepool
oxygen during the afternoon, when actual tidepool oxygen
concentrations tend to level off. When manipulated over a
midnight to noon time course, the model highlighted the
importance of algae to both addition and depletion of oxygen in
tidepools. Other factors that showed significant effects on
ambient oxygen levels included invertebrate population,
daylength, and local topography.
