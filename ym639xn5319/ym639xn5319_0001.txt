ABSTRACT
1 examined the changes in levels of endogenous heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 72 and Hsp
74) in the Tegula congeners T. brunnea, T. pulligo, and T.funebralis in response to cold shock. I
also monitored behavioral changes caused by cold exposure. To examine Hsp levels, snails were
first placed in either 1° or 4° C (40.5° C) seawater for either 2 or 10 h, then placed back in
ambient temperature (13° C) seawater. Levels of Hsp expression 2 and 10 h after the end of the
shock were quantified via western analysis. These levels were compared to those of snails not
exposed to cold stress. In individuals facing 10 h cold exposures, levels of Hsp 72 after 2 h of
recovery in general did not vary substantially from pre-exposure levels, but decreased
significantly after 10 h of recovery. These data suggest that different exposure lengths may
confer different signals that activate distinct physiological responses to cold shock. The
behavioral study found that following cold (1-3° C) exposure, the subtidal congeners T. brunnea
and T. pulligo were more likely to enter a chill coma (foot retracted, operculum firmly closed)
than T. funebralis. These behavioral differences could indicate that the subtidal species would be
less capable than T. funebralis of responding to environmental cues and conditions following
cold shock.
