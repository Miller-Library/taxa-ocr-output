Fig. 1. Levels of Hsp 72 in T. funebralis relative to bovine Hsc 70 standard. Error bars are
standard errors of the mean (n=5). Asterisks denote significant difference from pre-exposure
values.
Fig. 2. Levels of Hsp 72 in T. brunnea relative to bovine Hsc 70 standard. Error bars are
standard errors of the mean (n=5). Asterisks denote significant difference from pre-exposure
values.
Fig. 3. Levels of Hsp 72 in T. pulligo relative to bovine Hsc 70 standard. Error bars are standard
errors of the mean(n=5 for control, 2-hour exposures, nâ€”4 for 10-hour exposures). Asterisks
denote significant difference from pre-exposure values.
