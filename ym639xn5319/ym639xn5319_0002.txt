INTRODUCTION
In an age of increasingly varying weather patterns and global climate change, the
mechanisms by which organisms cope with thermal stress merit study. While much work has
been devoted to the ability of organisms to withstand heat stress, relatively little has looked at the
lower thermal tolerances of species. In this study, I examine the cold stress response of the
Tegula congeners T. funebralis, T, brunnea, and T. pulligo.
The Tegula species used provide an ideal study system for examining important aspects
of thermal tolerance and cold stress. As they are closely related (though there are some concerns
about T. pulligo, see Hellberg 1998), any comparisons between their thermal biology are unlikely
to be confounded by differences in phylogeny. Also, one would expect them to experience
different ranges of temperatures as they live at different tidal heights and have different northern
distributions. T. funebralis inhabits the low- to mid- intertidal zone, and has a northern
distribution that extends to Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Abbott and Haderlie 1980). T.
brunnea lives in the low intertidal to subtidal zone, and ranges northward to Cape Arago, Oregon
(Abbott and Haderlie 1980). T. pulligo lives exclusively in the subtidal zone, and ranges as far
north as Sitka, Alaska (Abbott and Haderlie 1980).
T. funebralis has been shown previously to be more capable of handling heat stress than
T. brunnea (Tomanek 2002). However, at the northern extreme of its range T. funebralis should
also experience colder temperatures than either T. brunnea or T. pulligo during emersion. To
date, little research has been conducted to explain this aspect of the thermal biology of the
Tegula congeners. This study looks at the patterns of Hsp 70 expression in response to different
cold stresses in the different species, as well as the variation in behavioral response of the species
to cold shock.
