exposure, the animals were placed in ambient temperature seawater. To ensure that individuals
stayed fully immersed in water during the entire experiment, snails were placed inside small
mesh-enclosed containers inside larger seawater tanks for all of the incubations. The gill tissue
of five individuals of each species was removed 2 hours and 10 hours following the end of each
cold exposure treatment. For a control sample, the gill tissue of five animals of each species was
taken before any cold exposure.
The gill tissues obtained by this method were used to quantify Hsp72 and Hsp74
expression via solid phase immunochemical analysis (western analysis). The analysis was run
according to the protocol described by Tomanek and Somero (2002) with the following
exceptions and additions: 300ul of homogenization buffer was added to the gill tissue of T.
pulligo for homogenization, and total protein concentration was determined using the BCA
protein (Pierce) assay rather than the micro-BCA (Pierce) protein assay. The resulting data for
each species and heat-shock protein were analyzed separately using an asymmetrical, 3-factor
ANOVA model with exposure temperature, exposure period, and recovery period as the three
factors. Each factor was treated as being fixed and orthogonal to the other factors. Significant
results from the models were investigated using the Student Newmann-Keuls (SNK) test.
RESULTS
Chill Coma Experiment
All snails were active one day following their exposure to cold treatments. However, 20
minutes following their exposure, all individuals of T. brunnea in both the 1° C air and the
seawater in the ice bath were inactive. All of the T. pulligo exposed to 1° C air were also inactive
at the 20 minute time point. All T. funebralis individuals in each treatment group were active
after 20 minutes.
