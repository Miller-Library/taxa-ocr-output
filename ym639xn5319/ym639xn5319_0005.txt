Analysis of Hsp70 Expression
The ANOVAs for levels of Hsp 72 in T. brunnea and T. funebralis and levels of Hsp 74
in T. pulligo and T. funebralis all showed highly significant (p«0.01) three way interactions
between the factors. The ANÖVA for Hsp 74 in T. brunnea displayed significant interactions
between exposure length and exposure temperature as well as between recovery period and
exposure temperature, and the ANÖVA for Hsp 72 in T. pulligo showed significant two way
interaction between all pairs of factors.
The most consistent pattern in the data was a significant reduction in Hsp 72 levels
relative to control values after 10 hours of recovery in groups with 10-hour cold exposure times
(Figs. 1-3). This pattern was present in all 10-hour exposure treatments. In all of these groups
except for T. pulligo exposed to 4° C water, Hsp 72 levels after 2 hours of recovery were similar
to control values and significantly greater than the levels after 10 hours of recovery. Groups
subjected to 2-hour exposures did not show any difference in Hsp 72 levels after 10 hours of
recovery relative to control, with the exception of T. pulligo exposed to 4° C water (Fig. 3). Of
these 2-hour exposure treatments, only T. pulligo exposed to 1° C and 4° C water and T. brunnea
exposed to 4° C water showed levels of Hsp 72 after 2 hours of recovery that were significantly
different from pre-exposure levels (Figs. 2, 3).
Expression of Hsp 74 proved difficult to quantify accurately, as the bands on the gel were
generally weak and often overrun by the Hsp 72 signal. No consistent patterns of expression
were found either within or among species. As previous studies have indicated that Hsp 74 is
constitutively expressed and does not usually respond strongly to thermal stress (Tomanek
2002), we assume the same is occurring in this case.
