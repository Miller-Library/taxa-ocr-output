MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chill Coma Experiment
This study subjected snails to four different temperature treatments. In two of the
treatments snails were placed in containers filled with ambient temperature (13° + 1° C)
seawater. These containers were placed in either an ice bath (1" treatment) or a cold room (air
temperature 4° C, 2“ treatment), and the seawater was allowed to equilibrate thermally with its
surroundings for 12 hours. Seawater in the cold room reached temperatures of 8° C(+ 1° C) and
6° C(+1° C) after 6 and 12 hours, respectively. Seawater in the ice bath reached temperatures of
6°C (+1° C) and 3° C (+ 1° C) after 6 and 12 hours, respectively. In the other two treatments,
snails were exposed directly to either 1° C (+1° C) or 4° C (40.1° C) air for 6 hours. Five large
adults of each species were used for each treatment. Snails were returned to ambient temperature
seawater at the end of the treatments. Individuals were observed 20 minutes and 24 hours
following the end of the cold exposures. During each observation, individuals were categorized
as being dead, active, or in a chill coma. For the purposes of the experiment, animals were dead
if they did not exhibit a foot withdrawal response, active if their operculum was not closed and
they exhibited a foot withdrawal response, and in a chill coma if their operculum was closed
firmly.
Analysis of Hsp 70 Expression
All snails to be used for the experiment were placed in an acclimation tank with ambient
temperature (13° C + 1° C) seawater for five days prior to cold exposure. Individuals were
subjected to four different exposure treatments: 1° C seawater (40.5° C) for 2 hours. 1° C
seawater (40.5° C) for 10 hours, 4° C seawater (40.5° C) for 2 hours, and 4° C seawater (40.5° C)
for 10 hours. Ten large adults of each species were used for each treatment. Following
