DISCUSSION
The highly significant interaction terms from the ANÖVAs suggest that none of the
factors are acting independently of each other. In particular, it seems that a combination of a 10-
hour exposure time and a 10-hour recovery time alone cause a significant down regulation of
Hsp 72, and to a lesser extent Hsp 74. This would seem to indicate that snails exposed to
prolonged cold stress exhibit a different response profile than those experiencing only transient
exposure to cold.
These results differ from studies of cold shock responses of other organisms, which
generally noted transient increases in levels of inducible Hsp 70 or its mRNA precursor (Ju et al.
2002; Martinez et al. 2001). In their study of gene expression in catfish, Ju et al. (2002) noted a
transient increase of inducible Hsp 70 2 hours following initial exposure to reduced temperature.
This increase in the level of inducible Hsp 70 had subsided after 24 hours of exposure (Ju et al.
2002). A study of Hsp production in nematodes also showed a transient increase in inducible
Hsp 70 (Martinez et al. 2001). The increased levels were noticeable after 2 hours, but had
subsided after 24 hours (Martinez et al. 2001). Both of these studies maintained their
experimental organisms at the cold exposure temperature and did not bring animals back to non¬
stress inducing temperature (Ju et al. 2002; Martinez et al. 2001). In our experiment, no
samples were taken until the organisms had been in ambient temperature seawater for at least 2
hours. These differences in sampling procedures could explain the discrepancies between the
experiments. Any increase in endogenous levels of inducible Hsp 70 during cold exposure in this
experiment could have already subsided during the 2-hour recovery period after which the first
sample was taken. Similarly, the decrease in Hsp 72 seen in the 10-hour exposure treatments in
this experiment might not have occurred in the other studies because the animals were not
