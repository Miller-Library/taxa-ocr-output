FIGURE LEGENDS
1. Colisella limatula, diagram of dissection; osphradium,
osphradial nerve, and location of recording electrode.
2. Osphradium as seen after CoCl, fill of the nerve trunk.
Area
where cell bodies are located'is most sensitive to electrical
stimulation.
3A. View of left osphradium under scanning electron microscope
magnified 850 times. Fissures are visible.
3B.
Surface of the left osphradium magnified 17k times. Surface
is composed of microvilli; cilia are not obvious, but possibly
present.
4A. Action potentials as seen due to electrical stimulation.
Voltages are between 7 and 10 volts for O.3ms.
4B. Spontaneous action potentials; these are of the same relative
size and time-course as the electrically stimulated ones,
5. Electrical stimulation of mantle adjacent to the osphradium
and corresponding lack of response.
Osphradial nerve activity due to the application of 250ul
of 1M NaCl.
7. Spike amplitude increase and decrease through time due to the
application of 1M NaCl through a hand micropipettor.
/(inset). Methods for measuring spike amplitude. Top half represents
method that assumes varying widths in the baseline. Bottom
half takes into account a constant baseline through time,
8A. Response of O.N. to the bathing of the osphradium with NSW.
8B. Response of O.N. to the changing of solutions from NSW to IM NaCl,
Larger slow spikes are caused by bubbles and movement of the organism.
80. Decrease in spike amplitude due to the addition of NSW.
