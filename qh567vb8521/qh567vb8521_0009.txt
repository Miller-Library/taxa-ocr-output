Analysis of Spike Amplitude Distributions
Because of the uncertain origin of the increased baseline noise
accompanying the Nacl stimulated spikes of large amplitude and high
frequency, the distribution of spike amplitudes was initially analyzed by
measuring spikes protruding from the baseline noise, thus assuming the
increase in the baseline was due to amplification of ambient electrical noise
(Fig 7 inset). As discussed above, however, a more reasonable source of the
apparent 'noise' is a large increase in small spike activity. Spike
amplitudes were therefore measured from the middle of the baseline as
indicated in figure 7 inset.
Using the first method of calculation it can be seen (Fig 104) that the
application of 1M Nacl to the osphradium causes a great increase in the
number of mid-sized spikes 3-6uv, a smaller increase of larger spikes (buy).
and apparent decrease in spikes (3uv. Due to the heightened baseline
problem, however, measurments of spikes 43uv are not very reliable in IM
Nacl. When the second method described above to measure spike amplitude is
used, it basically ignores spikes (3uv. This analysis (Fig 10B) shows that
the 1M Nacl distribution probably follows the NSW curve at the smaller
amplitudes, but deviates sharply from it above 4uv. The primary effect of 1M
Nacl can be described as a great increase in spikes Youv which are very rare
in NSW. It is important to note that the qualitative effect of IM Nacl is
not dependent on the method of analysis.
The effect of 0.5M Nacl + ASW on the spike amplitude distribution is
also plotted in figures 10 A & B. Using the first method of analysis, the
effect is a marginal increase in the 3-6uv spikes (Fig 10A). Following the
second method, however, a dramatic increase in the number of mid-sized spikes
becomes evident. Few very large spikes appear in 0.5M Nacl + ASW. Again.
