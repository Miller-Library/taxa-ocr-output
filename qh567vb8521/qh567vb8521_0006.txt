a capillary electrode filled with 350mM CoCla buffered to PI 7.0 with Tris.
This solution was slightly hypotonic (830 mosmols). The electrode was
attached to a 6 volt battery through a 10M ohm resistor, and a current passed
between the electrode and an external Ag:AgCl wire. The preparation was
allowed to sit for 9-18 hours. The electrode was then removed and the
specimen was washed in NSW for four minutes. The cobalt was then
precipitated with a 1-5% solution of ammonium sulfide, afterwhich, it was
placed in 102 formalin + NSW overnight to fix. Dehydration was with ethanol.
Specimens were mounted in Permount and viewed under a compound microscope,

Anatomy of the Osphradium and Osphradial Nerve
Filling nerves with CoCly allowed positive identification of the nerve
that extends to the left osphradium, but no part of the actual osphradial
organ was stained with cobalt. Individually stained cell bodies (glou dia.
were found lying within the mantle tissue along the posterior edge of the
organ (see Fig. 2). Single filled axons eminating from these cell bodies
were seen transversing the mantle beneath the organ in the direction of the
nerve trunk. Positive identification of filled cell bodies or axons in other
areas (i.e. along the medial edge of the organ) was not made. Presumably the
cell bodies which were stained are part of the osphradial ganglion often
referred to in the literature, and axons of these cells pass out via the O.N.
to the more centralized ganglia.
The use of the scanning electron microscope to identify chemo-receptors
yielded no definite results. The organ appears to be covered with fissures
and cracks running throughout (Fig 34). Under greater magnification (Fig 3B)
it is evident that the entire surface of the osphradium is composed of
