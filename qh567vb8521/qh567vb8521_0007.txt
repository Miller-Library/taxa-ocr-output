microvilli. Chemoreceptive paddle cilia were not abundant, if present at
all, in the Colisella limatula osphradia examined.
Electrical Stimulation of the Osphradium
Osphradial nerve activity due to electrical stimulation of the
osphradium was routinely observed. Electrically stimulated action potentials
occurring with the lowest threshold, and presumably reflecting single unit
activity (Fig 44) and spontaneously occurring action potentials (Fig 4B) were
roughly similar in magnitude and time course. The lowest threshold responses
could only be obtained from areas of the organ which were much more sensitive
to electrical stimulation than others. These areas were the posterior and
medial edges of the organ (Fig 2). These areas probably correspond to where
the cell bodies of the O.N. axons lie. Stimulation of areas of the maatle
adjacent to the organ did not lead to significan activity in the O.N. (Fig
5).
Osphradial Nerve Activity Due to Stimulation by Hypertonic Nacl
Activity in the O.N. was also routinely stimulated by application of
250ul of 1M Nacl. Figure 6 shows the result of applying 1M Nacl directly to
the sensory epithelium of the left osphradium. Both frequency and amplitude
increased in the spikes recorded from the O.N. (see Fig 7). It can be seen
that the time course of spikes during 1M Nacl exposure (Fig 6) was very
similar to those of the control solution in figure 4B.
The increased spike amplitude and frequency were maintained until the
osphradium was washed with NSW (in Fig 7 260sec). Once washed, frequency
and amplitude soon returned to normal. Application of IM Nacl to the
anterior and posterior ends of the mantle or foot of the limpet did not vield
results. Similarly, application to the cephalic tenticles did not cause
excitation of units in the O.N.
