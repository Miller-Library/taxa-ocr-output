9. Frequency of spikes greater than 2uv above the baseline in
response to the addition of NSW and 1M NaCl. Readings were
taken in 2 second blocks. Time to reach full response is
approximately 4 seconds after changing solutions.
10A. Number of spikes, occurring in four second blocks, vs. spike
amplitude before adjusting for constant baseline (see text
for details).
10B. Same as 10A after adjusting for a constant baseline.
11. Number of spikes vs. spike amplitude in response to the addition
of 1M NaCl, and O.5M Na-Gluconate + ASW.
12. Number of spikes as a function of amplitude due to the
application of O.5M NMG-CI +ASW, and O.5M NaCl + ASW.
13. Osphradial nerve response to the addition of O.6M Sucrose + ASW,
and 0.5M Na-Gluconate. Spike number vs. spike amplitude.
