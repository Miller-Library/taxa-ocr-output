another started without stopping the general flow into the medium. During
each experiment one barrel was filled with NSW. One barrel was filled with a
solution known to elicit a positive response (e.g. 1H Nacl) as a check of
organ viability. The third barrel was filled with an experimental solution
to be tested and compared.
Control solutions of NSW and ASW were allowed to flow on the organ for 2
to 4 minutes to ensure equiliberation. Experimental and the positive
response check solutions flowed between 1 and 5 minutes. At the conclusion
of each experiment the nerve was electrically stimulated to reconfirm that
the nerve was still in the recording electrode.
Experimental Solutions
Hypertonic IM Nacl was used to increase Na, Cl, and osmolarity. O.SM
Na-Cluconate i ASW was used to vary the Na while keeping Cl constant, while
raising the osmolarity. O.5M N-Methyl-Clucamine-Cl 4 ASW was used to raise
the number of Cl ions in the solution, keeping the Na normal, and raising the
osmolarity. O.6ti Sucrose + ASW was used to raise the osmolarity while
keeping the Na and Cl concentrations normal. A lM LiCl solution was prepared
to test if the osphradium was a Na specific receptor, or sensitive to high
osmolarity (see table 1 for actual concentrations).
Scanning Electron Microscope Preparation
specimens were prepared for scanning electron microscopy by fixation in
a 12 glutaraldehyde, 12 para-formaldehyde, 0.22 Na Cacodylate, 857 sea water
solution; dehydration was in acetone. Critical point drying with Co was
employed to avoid the grape-to-raisin effect.
CoCla Filling of the Nerve
The preparation of the animal for the cobalt fill was done in a cold
room (4'C) to keep the specimen fresh. The nerve was cut and sucked up into
