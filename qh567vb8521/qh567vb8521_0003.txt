Specimins of Colisella limatula were collected from the Great Tide Pool
in Pacific Grove, California. Limpets were maintained in holding tanks in
running natural sea water at 16°0.
Dissection Technique
To expose the osphradial nerve, an animal was deshelled with a scalpel
blade, placed in a slygard bottomed dish filled with sea water, and
restrained using insect pins. An incision was made in the mantle tissue
along the dorsal midline running posteriorly from the head of the organism.
The two flaps of mantle were then gently pulled back and the connective
tissue cut away from the mantle- exposing the osphradial nerve. The left
osphradium was used in all experiments because it was more easily isolated
and recorded from than was the right. All tissue posterior to the O.N. was
removed to reduce the possibility of muscular contraction during stimulation.
All dissections and experimentations were carried out in natural sea water.
Experimental Set Up
An electrical stimulating electrode was constructed of fine Pt wires
embedded in silicon glue to expose only the ends of the wires. The electrode
was placed on different areas on the left osphradium to map sensitivity and
confirm that the recording electrode was properly positioned on the O.N.
Rectangular pulses of 0.3 ms duration and 8-40 volts were employed.
Recording suction electrodes made from glass hematocrit tubes were pulled on
a micro-pipette puller and broken to a diameter approximately equal to that
of the nerve (150 um). The recording electrode measured the voltage
difference between two Ag:AgCl wires: one placed inside the syringe, and the
other wrapped around the glass tip— careful insulation of this wire with
Q-dope, except for the tip, was important to minimize the stimulus artifact.
The recording electrode was filled with NSW. Recordings were amplified 1000
