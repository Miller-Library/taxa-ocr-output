spikes (Fig 13). Although the reaction to O.54 Na-Gluconate t ASW is not as
profound as that in figure 11, there is still an increased number of the
larger sized spikes, but this effect appears to be shared by 0.6M Sucrose t
ASW.
One other solution proved to be a potent stimulus for the osphradium,
Im Licl elicited a response similar to that given by IM Nacl. There was a
great increase in amplitude and frequency following application of this
substance.
Substances which proved to be ineffective stimulants were light.
Pisaster ochraceous tube feet, dacron line (mechanical), and distilled water
(applied by the 250ul pipettor method).
DISCUSSION
The findings with the scanning electron microscope that the osphradium
of Colisella limatula does not show abundant sensory structures, in
particular, paddle cilia, appears to be congruent with data on the osphradium
of Patella and other prosobranch limpets. Possibly most sensory elements are
only free nerve endings buried under the microvillar coat, and very few
special sensory structures are visible protruding through this coat
(Haszprunar, 1985 A). However, the complete lack of ciliated sensory
elements noted in the present study must be questioned. This could possibly
be attributed to preparative techniques and would have to be verified with
additional observations of the osphradium under the scanning electron
microscope. Transmission electron microscopy would be necessary to observe
those areas beneath the microvilli-coated surface of the osphradium.
Electrical stimuli proved very useful in confirming that the recording
electrode made tight contact with the O.N.. Because the posterior edge and
