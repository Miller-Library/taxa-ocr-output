times by a Tektronix FM122, filtered at 1000Hz (high-pass) and 8Hz
(low-pass), and displayed on a storage oscilloscope and Gould 220 chart
recorder.
Positioning of the electrode was on the osphradial nerve before the
split leading to the left and right pleural ganglia (see Fig. 1). Slight
suction was applied to the nerve until either spontaneous activity was
observed or the nerve was sucked up into the electrode, forming an omega
shape. The nerve was then slightly raised from the body to reduce the
possibility of mechanical noise interferring with the recording of action
potentials. In all cases, before testing for chemically stimulated nerve
activity, positive responses were obtained with electrical stimulation of the
osphradium or of the nerve itself.
Chemical stimulation of the nerve originally consisted of introducing a
hand micropipettor into the bath, slowly releasing 250 ul of solution onto
the organ, and then removing the pipettor from the bath. To wash the organ
with a new substance the process was repeated.
It was felt that this method of application left too many uncontrolled
variables and often generated unacceptable electrical and mechanical noise.
The application method was then changed to a three barreled solution
distributor mounted on a micromanipulator which could be turned on and off at
will, allowing one solution to be dontindousky fidetng. Sach bagcel
cioposasie pipettor tip) was fed from Intramedic Polyethylene tubing attached
to an individually valved 60ml syringe. Flow from each of the barrels could
be started or stopped with minimal mechanical or electrical disturbance, Flow
rate was approximately one drop per second into a dish containing 50 ml of
NSW.
Three barrels for bathing were used so that one could be stopped and
