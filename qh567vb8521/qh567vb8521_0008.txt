Several problems with the hand pipettor method used to obtain the
results in figure 7 stimulated development of the three barreled method of
applying solutions (see methods). Mechanical and electrical noise produced
by solution changes was thereby minimized. All of the remaining experiments
to be described were carried out using this three barreled method. Figure 84
shows that turning off and on the sea water control flow caused little change
in O.N. activity. The application of artificial sea water also caused no
stimulation (not illus.). Bathing the organ in M NaCl yielded a
characteristic effect upon every application. Both spike amplitude and
frequency increased markedly in IM NaCl and returned to normal when NSH was
reintroduced (Fig 80).
Application of 1M Nacl, besides causing an increase in the frequency and
amplitude of O.N. spikes, also apparently resulted in a heightened ammount of
baseline noise (as in Fig. 8A & B). This enlargement was only seen when
solutions led to an obvious increase in spikes of ) 2-3uv, and promptly
dissapeared when the control solution (NSW) was reapplied and the spikes
decreased in'frequency (Fig 8B & C). Increased baseline could be due to
either a large increase in small spikes (2-3 uv, or coincidental
amplification of background electrical noise, but there is no apparent reason
for the latter possibility.
Frequency of O.N. Discharge in Response to lM Nacl
Figure 9 shows the frequency of spikes (in 2 sec bins), which are
larger than 2uv, through time. Application of 1M Nacl solution causes a
large increase in the frequency of such spikes. The time to reach peak
effect and return to the control level, following readmission of NSW, is
approximately four seconds. This trend of heightened frequency was typical
for all experiments using 1M Nacl.
