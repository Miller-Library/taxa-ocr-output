ABSTRACT
Suction capillary electrodes were employed to study the response of the
osphradial nerve to electrical and chemical stimulation in the limpet,
Colisella limatula. The osphradial nerve was filled with CoCl to identify
individual cell bodies and axons along the posterior edge of the osphradium.)
Chemo-sensitive paddle cilia on the surface of the osphradium were not
abundant, if present at all, when observed under the scanning electron
microscope. The organ proved to be sensitive to the application of IM NaCl,
IM Licl, and 0.5M Na-Gluconate + ASW; it gave a heightened response both in
frequency and amplitude of action potentials observed passing along the
osphradial nerve (O.N.). A second effect was also observed: the organ was
sensitive, on a smaller scale, to 0.6M Sucrose +ASW, and 0.5M Nacl + ASW.
The application of these substances resulted in smaller increases in
amplitude and frequency, but still visibly greater than that of natural sea
water (NSW) which had no effect. Ineffective substances for osphradial
stimulation were 0.5M N-Methyl-Glucamine-Cl, light, Pisaster ochraceus tube
feet, dacron line, and distilled water.
