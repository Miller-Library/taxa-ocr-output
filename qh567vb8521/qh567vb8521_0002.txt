INTRODUCTION
The function of the gastropod osphradium is, in general, poorly
understood. Based on morphological studies, the osphradium in many
prosobranchs has been identified as chemosensory (Haszprunar, 1985 A).
The only physiological work has been carried out on the opistobranch.
Aplysia, where recordings were made from central nervous system cell bodies
which presumably were targets for axons coming from the osphradium via the
O.N. In these studies osmotic, mechano, and chemo all proved successful
stimulants (Stinnakre & Tauc. 1968) (Jahan-Parwar, et-al, 1969). A body of
behavioral literature also exists and supports the idea that the osphradium
in the predatory gastropod Biomphalcria glabrata serves as a food detector
(Townsend. 1973).
The osphradium of prosobranch limpets has not been previously
investigated physiologically. It is unlikely that it would serve as a
mechanoreceptor or sediment detector because limpets are found exclusively on
rocks. It is also unlikely that it is a food detector in this
non-carnivorous browsing gastropod. Therefore, the project attempted to
detect an osmo, or chemo receptor in the limpet, Colisella limatula. These
animals are subjected to osmotic stresses in their intertidal habitats.
The approach taken was to record electrical activity in the osphradial
nerve following stimulation of the organ's sensory epithelium.
These experiments represent the first such successful recording from the
O.N. of any gastropod.
