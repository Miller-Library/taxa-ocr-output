medial corner of the osphradium were electrically sensitive it is likely that
the cell bodies found in these areas, using cobalt back fill, were
stimulating the O.N. to fire. These cell bodies possibly are constituents of
the osphradial ganglion.
Osphradial sensitivity to 1M Nacl, O.5M Nacl + ASW, O.SM Na-Gluconate.
and not to O.5M N-Methyl-Glucamine-Cl suggests that it is a chemosensor for
Na. However, because it is also sensitive to a high osmotic pressure (0.6M
Sucrose + ASW), with no increase in Na content, it also suggests that there
is a hyperosmotic receptor present in the osphradium. Why the organ does not
respond to hypertonic NMG-Cl is mysterious. Osphradial stimulation by
hypertonic media is a result similar to that observed in the opisthobranch
Aplysia (Stinnakre, J & L Tauc, 1968). The organ in Colisella does not
appear to respond to hypotonic sea water.
It is believed that the Na is not directly acting on the neural
processes near the osphradium increasing their excitability and causing the
increased O.N. activity. The cell bodies in question lie embedded in mantle
tissue, away from the surface of the organ. Excess flow from the solution
distributor does not directly reach the O.N. after it exits from the mantle
until long after the four seconds required for stimulation to start or
reverse. The flow is blocked by mantle tissue and the solution dissipates
away from the organ and nerve. Although additional controls for such
concerns are desirable, it is felt that the responses to chemical stimulation
are of fibers triggered by receptors in the organ proper.
Two effects of chemical stimulation are described in this report. The
first is an increase in both frequency and amplitude of the largest spikes
Obuv). Solutions evoking this response are 1M Nacl, O.5M Na-Gluconate +
ASW, and IM LiCl. The second effect is an increase in medium sized spikes
