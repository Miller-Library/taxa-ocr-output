the qualitative effect of 0.5M Nacl + ASW is the same in figures 10 A & B.
but for reasons discussed above, the picture given in figure 10B is taken to
be the more realistic one.
Analysis of all further amplitude distributions were carried out using
the second method of spike measurment. All calculations were done from four
second blocks occurring four seconds after changing solutions (to allow
equiliberation, see figure 9). Numbers smaller than 2-3uv are too ambiguous
to count, because they are lost in the heightened baseline noise accompaning
increased activity.
Experimental Variations of Na, Cl, and Osmolarity
Because 1M Nacl and 0.5M Nacl + ASW both had definite effects on
activity in the O.N., it was believed that some aspect associated with the
increased NaCl content of these media evoked the response. Variations of
concentrations of Na, Cl, and osmolarity were tested. O.5M Na-Gluconate +
ASW (see table I) was used to double the concentration of Na, and to increase
osmolarity, while keeping Cl at its normal level. O.5M N-Methyl-Glucamine-Cl
+ ASW was used to increase the concentration of Cl and osmolarity, while
keeping Na normal. Finally, O.6M Sucrose + ASW was used to increase
osmolarity alone, while keeping both Na and Cl concentrations normal.
In three separate experiments the O.N. response to 0.5M Na-Gluconate +
ASW applied to the osphradium was similar to that observed using IM Nacl- an
increased ammount of larger spikes. One example is shown in figure 11. On
the other hand, application of O.5M NMG-Cl + ASW yielded no definite effects
on O.N. activity. Figure 12 shows an example, and similar results were
obtained in two other experiments. The solution designed to produce a more
specific osmotic stress (0.6M Sucrose + ASW) evoked a response similar to
that caused by 0.5M Nacl + ASW, namely a large increase in the mid-sized
