INTRODUCTION
Until recently, little was known of the effects
of DDT on marine organisms. With analyses demonstra-
ting the presence of DDT in such animals as the pereÂ¬
grine falcon (Risebrough, 1968) and various other sea
birds (Risebrough, personal communication), blue fin
tuna, northern anchovy, English sole, Pacific jack
mackerel, and squid (Risebrough, 1967), the preva-
lence of the pesticide in the ocean was established.
Its deleterious effects have been documented in ani-
mals high in the pelagic food web; little work, how-
ever, has been done on the effects on those animals
at the base of the food web, the zooplankton.
The marine copepod, Calanus helgolandicus, was
chosen because it is representative of the zooplank-
ton, easily obtainable, and has been the subject of
many respiration studies (Marshall and Orr, 1966; Cono-
ver, 1960; Zeiss, 1963; Raymont and Gauld, 1951).
The aims of this study were to determine the
visible effects of various concentrations of DDT in
the medium and to make preliminary investigations
of the effects of 1 ppb DDT on the rate of oxygen
consumption of these animals.
