ith time until a critical level is reached, or that
with low concentrations, a longer time period is re-
quired to cause the metabolic damage which presumably
incapacitates the animals. Copepods were in-
cills or
cubated up to lu4 hours at 1 ppb before succumbing
to the pesticide; at this point the controls were
still lively. Asithe concentrations were increased,
the time required before visible effect was observed
decreased.
Concentrations as high as 10,000 ppb were tested
even at this level all animals were not killed
2b hours, although 100% were affected. Because so
much of the DDT precipitated at levels above 1000 ppb
most experiments were conducted at lower concentra-
to ensure as much accuracy and retention of the

original concentration as possible. This method was
not infallible, however, as white particles presumed
be DDf or associated with DDT were observed on the
appendages and antennae of the copepods incubate
for 48 hours at concentrations as low as 30 ppb
