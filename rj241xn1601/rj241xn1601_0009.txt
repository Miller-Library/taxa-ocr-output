controls. The difference in rates is neither cons-
tant nor consistent within any experiment, but ranges
from 0.06 to 2.07 ul 0,/animal/hour. In all experi-
ments at 1 ppb both of these characteristics appear.
After 96 hours of incubation in the storage jars,
the animals in Experiment B treated with DDT were be-
ginning to show effects of the pesticide. By 144
hours they were all moribund while the controls were
fairly lively throughout the experiment. Despite
this the respiration of the treated animals at 144
hours remained 0.356 ul 02/animal/hour higher than the
controls' respiration. Since respiration in cope-
pods is usually related to movement these results
are difficult to explain unless the amount of stress
experienced under such conditions is taken into ac-
count.
The peak found at 48 hours appears to be re-
lated to the presence of ethanol and not to that of
DDT. No such peak was found in sea water controls.
Possibly the ethanol causes a peak in activity around
48 hours which is reflected in the respiratory rate.
