ABSTRACT
Marine copepods (Calanus helgolandicus) were classified as visi-
bly unaffected, visibly affected, or dead after varying periods
of incubation in varying concentrations of DDT. At 24 hours 50%
were affected (visibly affected plus dead) by a predicted 60 ppb;
at 48 hours 50% were affected by a predicted 5.8 ppb. It was
found that 1 ppb DDT increased the rate of respiration over that
of the controls.
