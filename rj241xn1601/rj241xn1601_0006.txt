were run with all experiments. Twenty animals were se-
lected from the closed jars with a large pipette at 24
hour intervals and placed directly in 300-ml dark
BOD bottles (1 animal/15 ml) containing 1 ppb DDT in
previously aerated sea water for eight hours. In
each set of experiments initial oxygen concentrations
were determined on duplicate bottles with correspon-
ding ethanol concentrations. Titrations were done
using the standard Winkler technique with 0.02 N thio-
sulfate. The water in the incubation jars was changed
periodically and results were not corrected for bac-
terial respiration. All phases of these experiments,
except titrations, were conducted at 12Â° C.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows representative results of the 24
hour incubations in DDT. There is a clear difference
between the effect on the experimental animals and
that on the controls. From the regression line,
fifty per cent of the animals are affected at 60 ppb.
The rank difference coefficient is 0.905.
The data from the 48 hour experiments is illus-
trated in Figure 2. Because of the longer incuba-
tion period lower concentrations of DDT are effec-
tive. From the regression line, fifty per cent of the
organisms are affected at 5.8 ppb. The rank difference
coefficient is 0.95.
Two typical respiration experiments are sum-
marized in Figure 3. At each point in a particular
experiment, the oxygen consumption of the experi-
