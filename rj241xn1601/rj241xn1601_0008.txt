Control animals were never affected in this manner.
To clarify the data presented in Figures 1 and
2 no differentiation was made between visibly affected
and dead organisms. However, it is interesting to
note that all copepods at 5 ppb for 48 hours were
visibly affected but able to move sporadically, while
those at 10 ppb for 48 hours were all dead (33%) or
moribund (67%). At 20 ppb for 48 hours, 90% were dead
and 10% were moribund. (see Table 1.) Moribund ani-
mals are those in which only heart beat and/or anal
contractions were observed.
Since even the lowest concentrations used here
are higher than those in the natural marine environ-
ment, longer experiments at much lower concentrations
should be run. Studies should also be done on the
methods and sites of DDT action within the organism.
To determine the permanence of DDT damage, copepods
could be incubated in, and then removed from, varying
concentrations of DDT and their progress followed.
Copepods react to DDT with violent, rapid twitching;
a more complete study of these reactions should be
undertaken. The lower limit of DDT activity on copeÂ¬
pods should be compared with levels found in both the
ocean and the phytoplankton they eat.
The respiration data given in Figure 3 has two
main characteristics: 1) the peak in respiration at
48 hours; 2) the fact that respiration of the expe-
rimental animals is always higher than that of the
