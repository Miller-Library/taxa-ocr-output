Discussion
C. curata and pseudocurata are found associated with
coralline algae in tide pools and clinging to wave-washed
rocks in the mid to low intertidal zones of exposed coastal
areas. Due to the intensity of wave action at these sites,
it is not feasible to observe the cucumbers at high tide.
However, the cucumbers are not observed to actively extend
their buccal podia at low tide, indicating that they feed
during high tides. Yet high tide, with its flow velocities
of 5 to 16 m/s (Vogel, 1981), seems an unlikely situation
for Cucumaria to be effectively feeding. How do these
animals feed?
According to Brumbaugh's estimates (1964), planktonic
diatoms comprise between 15 & 50% of the C. curata diet,
while detritus and sessile diatoms make up 10 to 708 of
the food source over a period of one year. Thus these
animals feed by sampling both the water moving by them
and the surface to which they are attached. What requirements
do these modes of feeding place on the structure and
materials of buccal podia?
High tide flow velocities impose drag forces on an
extended B.P. stalk. Overall drag force is a combination
of pressure drag and frictional drag. The maximum value
of 10"1.10° N for pressure drag is calculated here for
B.P. at 90 in 5-16m/s current. This is unrealistic in that
experiments show that flow velocities as low as 0.3-0.8m/S
create enough stress for the B.P. to fold backward to
135 with the current; and only up to velocities of 0.2-
0.3 m/s can the animals maintain their B.P. at angles of
