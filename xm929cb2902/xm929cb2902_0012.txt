For the folded back B.P., pressure drag no longer
exerts any substantial force on the B.P. stalk. As stated
previously, experiments show that B.P. bend back to 135
at velocities of 0.3 m/s; therefore B.P. would certainly
be folded completely back (180) at currents of 5-16 m/s
and probably as low as im/s. Here, friction drag, 10-3
to 10-2 N, is calculated for B.P. 5-16 m/s current at
180.
Both pressure and friction drags impose stresses on the
buccal podia stalk. If it is assumed that the force is
resisted solely by the collagen sheath, the imposed stress due
to pressure drag would be 10°-109 N/m2 for the unrealistic
situation of B.P. holding up at 90' in 5-16m/s current.
Not only is this situation unlikely, but it is probably
impossible. The collagen of rat tail tendon breaks at
a stress of 10'N/m (Wainwright, et al, 1976). Therefore the
B.P. would be torn apart at the calculated stress due
to pressure drag of 10°-10? N/m2. However, the stress
due to frictional drag as calculated for 180' B.P. even
in 5-16 m/s current, is 10“-102 N/m2, well below the
breaking stress values.
Among the mechanisms of suspension-feeding outlined
by aerosol particle filtration theory (Rubenstein & Koehl,1977)
direct interception is the most important, as indicated
by its high relative index (see results). The index of
direct interception is independent of water velocity, but
