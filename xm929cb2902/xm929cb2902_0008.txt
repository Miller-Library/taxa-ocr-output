Mode of Particle Capture
The aerosol particle filtration theory offers five
mechanisms by which particles may be trapped. (See Figure
4) This theory involves a filter system of widely spaced
sticky fibers, in this case, papillae. This theory replaces
the classical ideas of sieving, wherein the captured par¬
ticles must be of larger diameter than the spacings of
sieving elements. Four of the mechanisms were examined in
relation to C. curata and C. pseudocurata particle capture.
The fifth mechanism involves electrostatic attraction and
does not significantly affect particle capture in seawater
due to an abundance of ions.) (Rubenstein and Koehl, 1977)
The index of direct interception as a method of particle
- dp/
capture was determined using the equation Non
1.689. (Rubenstein and Koehl, 1977, after Pich, 1966)
dp, the diameter of particles captured, is 25 (diatom
sizes measured visually from gut contents); and da, the
"fiber" diameter, is 14.8 (papillae measured from the SEM.
