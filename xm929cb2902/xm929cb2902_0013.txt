suspension-feeding effectiveness by this method (defined
as the number of particles captured /time) does depend
on the total volume of particles intercepted by the buccal
podia's sticky surface area; and therefore is a function of
velocity. Increased water velocity results in the following
gains in suspension-feeding effectiveness:
(1) A large volume of fluid flowing past the buccal
podia per time.
(2) A thinner boundary layer adjacent to the buccal podia.
The decreased velocity in a boundary layer would decrease
the volume of water intercepted.
(3) An increased index of inertial impaction, thus
slightly increasing the suspension-feeding effectiveness.
In contrast, increased water velocity simultaneously
diminishes suspension-feeding effectiveness as follows:
(1) Particle capture indices for motile-particle disper-
sion and gravitational deposition decrease.
(2) Drag force, and therefore stresses are increased
which cause the B.P. to fold back, decreasing the
exposure of sticky surface area to flow, and consequently
reducing particle capture.
It seems likely that there exists some optimum water
velocity at which these cucumbers suspension-feed most
effectively. Although exact figures cannot be calculated
at this point, the optimum velocity is likely to be below
1m/s since 180' B.P. bending occurs above this velocity
and reduces suspension-feeding effectiveness by minimizing
