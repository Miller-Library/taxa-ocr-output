Boundary Layer
The boundary layer, a function of viscosity, is an
area of retarded flow adjacent to the surface of an object
in the flow. A rough estimate of the boundary layer thickness
(as if the buccal podia did not affect the flow around the
cucumbers' bodies) was calculated from the equation
6- 586
(Vogel, 1981),
where 4 is the boundary layer thickness, x (extended buccal
podia measured under dissecting scope and values applied to
similar size animals) is the distance from the base of the
stalk to the tip, u is the viscosity of 15Â°0 sea water,
o is the density of sea water, and U (values at which buccal
