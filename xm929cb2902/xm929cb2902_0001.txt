Vogelzang
Abstract:
Cucumaria curata and C. pseudocurata live and feed
in the hydrodynamically stressful environment of exposed
intertidal areas. They have been observed to actively
feed in flow velocities up to 0.2 m/sec., while allowing
their feeding tentacles to bend with the current as flow
increases. They suspension feed with peak effectiveness
at some optimum low water velocity. Consequently, it is
suggested that they incorporate detrital feeding into their
food-gathering behavior in order to supplement the aerosol
particle capture. However, this too presents mechanical
problems. The feeding strategies and mechanisms of C. curata
and C. pseudocurata may depend on local water velocities
within their different microhabitats, and thus help to
differentiate their respective niches.
