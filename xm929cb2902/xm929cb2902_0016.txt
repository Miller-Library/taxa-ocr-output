Vogelzang
C.curata and pseudocurata exhibit slightly different behaviors
and occupy slightly different habitats in the field.
Specifically, C. curata has 10 evenly arranged buccal
podia and is generally larger in size than C. pseudocurata.
C.curata lives isolated, in pairs, or in small groups
located within vertical rock crevices in wave-exposed
zones. In contrast, C.pseudocurata tends to aggregate in
clusters of numerous individuals on the encrusting coralline
algae at the bottoms of protected tidepools. This smaller
species has two ventral B.P. which are reduced in size
compared with its other eight (Collison, 1983). These
differences may possibly play a role in affecting feeding
behavior and local flow in each species' microhabitat.
Further investigation is necessary in order to determine
niche differentiation between C.curata and C.pseudocurata,
especially in relation to feeding mechanisms.
One intriguing observation (with potential for closer
examination) was that of the cucumber's apparent streamÂ¬
lining behavior, when the anterior end was directed into
high velocity flow of more than 0.8m/s (see fig. 7). When
the animal's anterior end oriented away from the current, it
still humped up the anterior end. More detailed investigation
is required to analyze the effectof this second shape
on flow forces.
This study has examined aspects of the mechanics of
feeding by C.curata and C.pseudocurata on wave-swept
shores. Present understanding of buccal podia mechanics
