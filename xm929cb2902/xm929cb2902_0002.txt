Vogelzang
Introduction:
Cucumaria curata and C. pseudocurata are small (up
to 4 cm when fully extended), dark brown holothuroids that
live in exposed intertidal regions on the Central Cali-
fornia coast, e.g. Yankee, Pescadero, and Cypress Points
just south of Pacific Grove. These cucumbers possess ten
feeding tentacles, or buccal podia, arranged radially around
the mouth. The buccal podia consist of cylindrical stalks
that are branched much like deer antlers and have mucous-
covered papillae at the tips (see Figures 5 and 6).
The cylindrical stalk is simply a 1.75 x 10 m thick
tissue wall surrounding a fluid-filled lumen. This wall
consists of a cuticle, epidermis, dermis, longitudinal muscle
fibers, and ciliated epithelium (Brumbaugh, 1964). Within
the dermis are circumferentially-arranged fibers making
up the collagen sheath.
The papillae are sticky protrusions to which food
particles adhere. Food particles are removed when the
animal retracts the entire stalk and inserts it into the
mouth.
Sea cucumbers are known to feed by extending their
buccal podia into the current to capture suspended particles.
by "shoveling" substrate into their mouths, and by picking
up detritus off solid surfaces (Hyman,1955).
In light of the fact that C. curata and pseudocurata
are not very sturdy animals, it seems unlikely that they
