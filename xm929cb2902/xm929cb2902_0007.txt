change in angle of the buccal podia and to peculiarities of
the relationship between Cpand Re at these velocities.
Stress
To determine the stress due to pressure drag that the
wall material of a buccal podia stalk might encounter, the
stalk was assumed to behave as a cylindrical cantilever,
and the formula G - M
was used (Wainwright, 1976).
M, the applied bending moment, equals DpX L, where D.
is the pressure drag (a typical value of 10 kg-m/s
as calculated for an angle of 60°, surface area of 1.32 x
10  m and velocity of .2 m/s) and L is the length from
the base to the center of mass (as determined with card¬
board models and a ratio of L/D 2 3.64. See Figure 3).
is the average radius of material in the stalk
Y -
(see Fig. 3), and I - is the second moment of area.
The stress (long before breakage) due to pressure drag
for the experimental angle of 60° and velocity of 20 cm/s
is between 10 and 10“ N/m. The stress for the (100u-thick)
collagen sheath in the buccal podia stalk, at an angle of
90° and field velocities up to 5 - 16 m/s, results in
values on the order of 10° and 102 N/m2. The stress due
to frictional drag was calculated (D/area) to be 10'-10-
N/m' for the collagen sheath in a buccal podia stalk at an
angle of 180° in field velocities up to 5 - 16 m/s.
