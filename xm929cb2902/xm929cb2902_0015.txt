behavior under the dissecting scope (Brumbaugh, 1964);
the cucumber sweeps its feeding tentacles along solid
surfaces, picks up settled material, and ingests the
detritus indiscriminately. Though much of the ingested
material
non-nutritive, Brumbaugh states that this is
likely to be the primary food-catching method.
However, as with suspension-feeding, the B.P. must be
extended when detrital feeding and thus experience frictional
and pressure forces as they are swept along the substratum.
These forces create the problem of folding the B.P. back at
water velocities as low as 0.3 m/s experimentally. On the
basis of the observations made here, it seems likely that
fluid dynamic forces thus render the feeding tentacles
less functional for effective suspension feeding and, to
a greater extent, non-functional for detrital feeding at
field velocities.
Yet these intertidal Cucumaria have been reported to
use a combination of suspension and detrital feeding.
How might this paradox be explained ?
It is possible that the conclusions reached here will
need to be modified when careful measurements are made
of the feeding behavior and flow in intertidal microhabitats
for example, local flow velocities around the B.P. crown
may be affected by the cucumbers' behavior: clustering
with one another, wedging themselves into crevices, living
at the base of the coralline alga Calliathron and even
crawling under the encrusting coralline algae.
