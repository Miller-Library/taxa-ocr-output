Vogelzang
should survive in environments of strong wave exposure.
This study was undertaken in order to examine these organisms
behavior at various water velocities in relation to the
mechanics of their buccal podia and feeding actions.
The results, along with Brumbaugh's lab observations
and diet estimates for C. curata (1964), and La Barbera's
ophiuroid particle filtration data (1978), suggest that
C. curata and pseudocurata perform both suspension and deÂ¬
trital feeding. The actual mechanics of their feeding methods,
however, cannot yet be determined without more conclusive
data.
