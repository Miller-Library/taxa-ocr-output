Many thanks go to Mark Denny for providing his direction,
motivation, and encouragement. Thanks also to Freya Sommer
for her patient listening and support and to Magruder for
his teaching and technical assistance. To the dwellers
of 629 Jewell, my warmest thank you for late night cookies
and laughter.
