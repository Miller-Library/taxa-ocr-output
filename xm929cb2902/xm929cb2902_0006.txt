Drag vs. Velocity
The pressure drag, Da, and frictional drag, Dp, forces
were calculated by the formulae
Dp - 2 Cp' S Ufe (Vogel, 1981), and
Dp - 2 Cp S U60 (Hoerner, 1965),
where the density of sea water,o, is 1.024 x 10 kg/m,
and U is the water velocity. The surface area, S, is .252 x
lengthx width of the buccal podia stalk where .252 is the
ratio ig for the Cucumaria in the SEM (Figure 5). Cp',
the useful drag coefficient, was obtained from the equation
'- Cp sin, which accounts for the change in angle of

the buccal podia in relation to the flow as water velocity
increases (Hoerner, 1965). The angle  was estimated
visually, and Cp and Cp were found using standard drag
coefficient vs. Reynolds Number plots for cylindrical objects
(Vogel, 1981 and Hoerner, 1965).
Reynolds Numbers were calculated using the Re - Pea
A
in which u 2 1.1 x 10 2 kg/m-s, the viscosity of sea water
at 15Â°0; the diameter, d, of the buccal podia stalk was
estimated from that of the Cucumaria shown in Figure 5.
The resulting graphs from plots of drag vs. velocity
(see Figure 2) show an increase in drag with increasing
velocity. The calculated shifts in these curves between
velocities of .07 -.19 cm/s are due to an observed step
