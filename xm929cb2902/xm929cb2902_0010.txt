podia were 90 - 120° relative to current) is the water velocity,
According to calculations using experimental velocity data,
the boundary layer thickness of 10 - 10 2 m would not be
great enough to include the buccal podia at angles up to
135° relative to the current (which appears to be the maximum
angle under experimental conditions).
Sticky Surface Area
The percent surface area of each buccal podia stalk
covered by mucous-covered papillae was calculated by
first figuring the surface area of the papillae and multiplying
by the number of papillae clusters as they appear on a single
stalk in the SEM (Figure 5), and finally dividing by the
