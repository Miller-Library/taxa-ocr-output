exposure of sticky surface area to flow.
Considering the suggested low range of water velocities
these species require in order to be effective suspensionÂ¬
feeders, it is unlikely, according to aerosol particle
filtration theory, that C.curata and C.pseudocurata are
exclusively suspension- feeders. This conclusion is
supported by a comparison of these cucumbers with two
species of ophiuroids that are thought to be strictly
suspension-feeders (Hyman, 1955). The calculated particle
capture indices for C.curata and pseudocurata are in rough
agreement with those for Ophiopholis aculeata (La Barbera,
1978) and Ophiothrix fragilis (Rubenstein and Koehl,1977).
(see figure 8:)
However, the cucumbers' mucous-covered papillae represents
only -0.05% of the surface area of each B.P. stalk.
Ophiuroid arms extend a much larger relative surface area
into the water column. Unless the cucumbers encounter a
correspondingly greater volume of particles in their fast
flow regimes, the ophiuroids are more effective suspension
feeders.
This analysis implies that suspension particle capture
is unlikely as an exclusive feeding mechanism for
C.curata and pseudocurata. Inevitably, these cucumbers
need an additional feeding mechanism. Based on behavioral
observations, the only likely alternative is detrital
feeding.
