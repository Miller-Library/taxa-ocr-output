Vogelzang
Materials and Methods
The apparatus used (see figure 1) allowed close observation
of the animal and visual approximation of buccal podia
angles through the glass tube. Flow was manually controlled
at the spigot and directly measured with a 500ml graduated
cylinder and stop watch. Average velocity was calculated
from flow by the equation:
flow (ml/s)/area(cm2)-velocity (cm/s)
where area is the cross-sectional area of the
Cucumaria subtracted from that of the tube.
Active animals were fixed in glutaraldehyde while pressure
was applied to the body in order to maintain extension of
the B.P. papillae. These fixed animals were then placed
in, first sea water, second distilled water, and gradually
dried in acetone, dry acetone and the C0Â» critical point
dryer. Dried specimens were gold-coated for 1.5 minutes.
and examined under the SEM. Measurements of B.P. papillae
diameter, surface area, and stalk length were taken from
the scanning electron micrographs.
By dissection of cucumbers relaxed in 50/50 MgCl, and
sea water, gut contents were obtained and visually
analyzed under 100X and 400X magnification for food
particle sizes.
B.P. were amputated from active animals and embedded
in 20% gum arabic with 10% formalin. Sections were cut
in freezing microtome. The stalks' inner and outer radii
