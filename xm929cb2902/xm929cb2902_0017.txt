Vogelzang
does not shed light on the problems of feeding under
conditions of fast flow. Resultant stress prevents full
and effective extension of the B.P. More measurements and
observations of behavior need to be made in the field to
better correlate laboratory results to various natural
conditions of microhabitat such as high tides during the
day and night.
