Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras

grow near each other on the floats, the two microhabitats are
very similar. Also, it is possible for worms to migrate freely
from one habitat to the other.
Standard deviations of average percent compositions were
large in all cases where the percent composition was substan-
tial. This suggests a large variability in diet in a sample
of worms. However, as a group, they could be selecting primÂ¬
arily for the food sources shown in Fig. 4.

LABORATORY FEEDING EXPERIMENTS
1). The first laboratory feeding experiments used detritus
(above).
2). No specimens performed feeding motions during the first
1.25 hrs. of observation. Then both worms in the bowl with
chopped Co
ictis began feeding on the anemone surrounded by
mucous. Feeding lasted approximately 5 minutes with the worms
moving their mouth apparati extensively. Within 5 hrs., one
worm developed an open sore on its dorsal anterior. Within
24 hrs., both worms were dead. No other worms were observed
performing the feeding behavior during 2 hrs. of observation.
Like hydroids, anemones are coelenterates and possess nemato-
cysts. However, D. moniloceras can apparently withstand only
the nematocysts of hydroids but perhaps not of anemones.
3). Gut analysis of one worm from each bowl after 3.8 days
yielded the following. Bugula appeared in the gut of the worm
from the bowl where Bugula was introduced as food. Sertularella
was present in the intestine of the specimen that was given
this genus and other hydroid genera as food. Thus, by placing
