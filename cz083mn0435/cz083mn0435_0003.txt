Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr. 3
worm with an empty gut was placed in each bowl with approx-
imately 4 mm2 of detritus previously collected from running
sea water in the laboratory. Observations of gut appearances
were taken approximately every 6 hours.
2). A variety of organic materials was chosen as food: a
tunicate, a brown alga (Macrocystis), a sea anemone (Corynactis),
tunicate matrix (of A. ceratodes), and phytoplankton. The
first four were sliced into small pieces within the range
0.5-1.5 mm2. Approximately 12 particles of each food and 5
drops of phytoplankton were introduced to separate small fin-
gerbowls with standing sea water. Nothing was added to the
control bowl. Two worms were added to each bowl and observed
for 6 hours.
3). To determine whether or not the worm would eat certain
organisms under simulated semi-natural conditions, scrubbed
Por tubes were added to two large fingerbowls until the bowls
were moderately full and the material dense. Then 6-7 spec-
imens, enough fresh sea water to cover the tubes, and 8 pieces
of food were introduced to each bowl. Bowl 1 contained Bugula,
a Bryozoan, with associated hydroids as food, and Bowl 2 con-
tained Obelia, a hydroid, as food. The bowls were maintained
at 12Â°0, and the water was replaced once a day.
