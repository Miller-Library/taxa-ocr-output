Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr.
INTRODUCTION
Dorvillea moniloceras (Moore, 1909) is a common represen¬
tative of the polychaete family Dorvilleidae in the Monterey
Bay area. Originally known as Stauronereis moniloceras, its
external morphology was first described by Moore (1909). Cham¬
berlin (1919) noted that gut analyses of another species of
Dorvillea, D. cr
ssa, yielded sand, diatoms, sponge spicules.
and crustacean fragments. According to Hartman (1945) speci-
mens can be collected intertidally among coralline algae in
Pacific Grove. Two other populations have been found in the
area, (1) subtidally in Macrocystis pyrifera holdfasts and
(2) on the underside of the boat floats at the Monterey Mar-
ina. To expand on gut analysis studies by Chamberlin (1919)
and in an attempt to elucidate the diet of D. moniloceras,
fecal pellet analyses were performed on specimens from the
latter habitat. Also laboratory feeding experiments were
conducted on specimens from the same habitat to support fecal
pellet data.

FECAL PELLET ANALYSIS
Specimens of D. moniloceras were collected by hand from
among the clusters of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica (abbreviated
as PCT), a polychaete, and colonies of Ascidia ceratodes, a
tunicate, on the underside of the boat floats at the Monterey
Marina. Two containers were used to transport each group of
