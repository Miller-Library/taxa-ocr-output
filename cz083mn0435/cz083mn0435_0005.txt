Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras

of the jaw apparatus of D. moniloceras. The second action is
that of grasping larger objects and passing them to the esoph-
ogeal opening. The laboratory feeding experiment using detri-
tus as the food showed that captive D. moniloceras will eat
detritus. After 30.5 hrs., four of the six experimental worms
had darkened guts, indicating presence of food material.
Detrital material is ubiquitous among Por tubes and tunicate
clusters, the habitat of the experimental animals.
Accompanying detritus in pellets are naviculoid diatoms.
Approximately half of the frustules appear devoid of the org
anism which susgests that they are being digested by the worm.
Diatoms are a rich source of lipid which could supply the worm
with high energy fuel. The small volume of diatoms accounts
for their small value in average percent composition (see
Figs. 5a,b).
The high incidence of crustaceans in feces can be accounted
for by the following. The identifiable crustaceans are benthic
copepods and ostracods, normally found in habitats similar to
Por and tunicate clusters. Detritus grazing by the worms could
include the consumption of these crustaceans.
The fourth most common constituents and third highest in
relative % composition are hydroids of several genera including
Obelia, Campanularia, Halecium, Sertularella, Bougainvillia,
ytia, and Gonothyraea (see Fig. 6). In spite of their
large size, they appear in specimens in the smallest size
group of Por samples. They occur more commonly in large worns.
