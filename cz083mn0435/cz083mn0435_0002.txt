Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras

worms from the marina to the laboratory where individuals were
immediately isolated into numbered Petri dishes. Specimens
were maintained in standing sea water at 12°0 for 1.5-2.0 days,
after which time the majority had defecated. Fecal pellets
were extracted from individual dishes with a Pasteur pipette,
isolated in separate compartments in sea water, and reserved
for analysis.
Size data of specimens consisted of width, length, and
number of segments. Data were obtained by anesthetizing each
worm separately in isotonic Mgcl, to impose a uniform body cond¬
ments were taken using a dissecting microscope,
ition. Measur
Worm width was measured from parapodia tip to parapodia tip in
the approximate middle section of the worm. Length was measured
from tip of prostomium to tip of pygidium. The prostomium,
peristomium, and pygidium were included in the number of seg¬
ments of each worm.
Analyses of pellets proceeded as follows. Relative amount
of feces was first estimated for each specimen on an arbitrary
scale of 0-5. Then individual pellets were placed on glass
slides and gently teased apart with needle probes. Finally, a
compound microscope (100x) was used in estimating relative
percentages in terms of volume of fecal pellet constituents.

1). To determine whether or not D. moniloceras would eat det-
ritus present in laboratory sea water, the following steps
were taken. Six small fingerbowls were submerged in a plastic
tub, 50x30x20 cm, with fresh running sea water. One starved
