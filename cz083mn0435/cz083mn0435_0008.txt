Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr. 8
D. moniloceras in an environment resembling its natural one.
the worm ate food that it normally eats, Sertularella, and
also ate food that it apparently does not normally eat, Bugula.
SUMMARY
The following conclusions can be made concerning the
feeding habits of D. moniloceras:
1. A wide variety of food material is ingested including
hydroids, Bowerbankia (a Bryozoan), sponge spicules, diatoms.
and crustaceans. Detrital material is the most commonly found
substance.
2. There is a tendency for larger worms to eat larger
pieces of food and smaller worms to eat smaller pieces.
3. D. mor
loceras was induced to eat some organisms
under laboratory conditions that it apparently does not nor-
mally eat in nature, although available to them there.
