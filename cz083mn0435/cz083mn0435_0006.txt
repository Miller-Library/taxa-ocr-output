Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras

to consume the hydroid (see Fig. 7). The majority of the
hydroid exoskeletons were empty, suggesting either that the worms
are consuming empty tubes or that they are taking in living
hydroid colonies and digesting the animal matter. In the lat-
ter case, D. moniloceras must have a high tolerance for nemat-
ocysts.
Bowerbankia gracilis (Bryozoa) occurs in the fecal pel-
lets analyzed (see Fig.8). Because of its large size relative
to setae and sponge spicules, Bowerbankia possesses a high
value for percent composition of fecal pellet despite pos-
sessing the lowest value for percent occurrence.
Statistically, the only significant variation in per-
cent occurrence between size classes occurs with sponge spic-
ules from worms found in POT clusters (pÂ«.005). Other fecal
constituents show increasing or decreasing tendencies as a
function of size class. For example, both hydroids and
Bowerbankia decrease in percent occurrence as width decreases
while Por crustaceans and diatoms increase as width decreases.
Conceivably, smaller worms may be forced to feed on smaller
food choices due to the limited size of their mouths.
Two species of a filamentous red alga, Polysiphonia, were
found in pellets of 5 worms taken at the same time from tunicate
clusters. These worms ingesting algae were larger than 3.0 mm:
smaller worms did not have any algae in their pellets.
Dietary constituents of worms from both habitats, PGT
and tunicates, closely resemble each other in occurrence and
percent composition of fecal pellets. Since PoT and A. ceratodes
