the number of worms against width range for a sample size of
101. The resulting histogram implies by its symmetry a normal
frequency distribution of widths about a mean value of 3.3 mm.
Figure ib plots the number of worms as a function of length.
The histogram generated suggests the existence of a bimodal
distrubution with the depression occurring in the 30-40 mm
range. A skewed distribution is depicted in Fig. 1c which
plots number of worms against number of segments. The occur-
rence of more worms with more segments connotes the possibil-
ity that worms add segments until a maximum determinate number
is reached. The i
ntuitive notion that worm length increases
with worm width is borne out by Fig. 2. Figures la,b.c show
that worm width serves as the best index of worm size.
Figure 3 cor
jains information from direct fecal pellet
analysis. Percent occurrences of the most common diet constit-
uents are illustrated for both the PCT and the tunicate popula-
tions in a decreasing order and an increasing order, respect-
ively. Although setae are shown to occur 46% of the time in
the POT population fecal pellets, an inadvertant sampling error
caused this value to be high. Figure 4 compares the average
percent composition by volume of 103 pellet samples obtained
from PoT and tunicate populations in terms of the most common
identifiable constituents. The arrangement of Fig. 4 is the
same as that of Fig. 3.
In all pellets examined, detritus was present, comprising
most of the average pellet in all worm size groups. Rasping
surfaces to free detritus appears to be one of the two actions
