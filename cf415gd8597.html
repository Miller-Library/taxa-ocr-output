DUCTION
INIHO
The burrowing snail, Olivella biplicata (Sowerby, 1825),
inhabits the intertidal and adjacent subtidal zones on sandy
shores along the wastern coast of North America. Edwards (1969)
noted that the animals tend to burrow under the sand surface
when exposed to light, and, in experiments with light gradients,
found that larger snails tend to cluster at lower light levels
than smaller snails. David Phillips of Hopkins Marine Station
had also observed that <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Olivella : Exact'>Olivella</span> tend to be out on the sand
surface at night and burrowed below it during the day, and
suggested that a biological clock might be involved (pers.
comm., 1972). The present study has been undertaken to further
investigate this response to light and to examine the possibility
of circadian
rhythms in Olivella biplicata. All
studies were carried out in the period April - June, 1972, on
populations available at low tide at the south end of Monterey
Bay, California.

FTELD STUDIES
An initial field study was carried out to see whether
more snails were on the sand surface at night than during the
day. Observations were made on consecutive days at low tide
in three areas: 1) the exposed portion of the beach (Boatworks
Beach) between Mussel Point and Point Alones, Pacific Grove,
2) a sheltered sandy cove on this same beach, and 3) the beach
just east of Fishermans Wharf (Wharf #1), Monterey. The
populations observed were always those covered by approximately
one foot of water at the time of observation. At each
sampling period, a 0.25me sheet metal quadrat frame was
pushed into the sand in two different places in each area,
and the numbers of animals above and below the sand within the
frame were recorded. Illumination during night studies was
provided by a five-battery flashlight shielded by two layers
of red cellophane.
The results are shown in Figure 1. The snails found
ranged from 1.5 to 3.Ocm in shell length. At least 50% of the
observed populations were below the surface at any one time.
Almost the only individuals found above the sand surface in
direct light were mating pairs, suggesting that the stimulus
of mating may supercede the stimulus to light. Excluding
mating pairs, data from three daytime readings (April 22, 23,
and 24) and three nightime readings (April 24, 26, and 27) were

pooled and averaged; the dillerence between mean percentages
of animals above the surface at night and during the day was
significant at the 998 level. The small samples found at

reflect the relatively high level on the beach at which it
was necessary to work due to tide and sur

Olivella biplicata, 1.5 to 3.Ocm in shell length, taken on May 2
from Monterey Harbor and maintained on a simulated beach composed
of two tons of sand in an outdoor tank, 15.5 x 9.5 x 2ft. at
Hopkins Marine Station. This beach had a slope of approximately
8' and the tank received a constant flow of fresh sea water.
Low tide was simulated by slowly draining and refilling the tank
every day between 0800 and 1400hrs; at low tide (1100 hrs.) the
tire beach was uncovered. The daylight low tide was unfortunate,
since it introduced another environmental variable during daylight,
but was unavoidable since the tank was also in use by other
investigators. Observations began one week after introduction
of Olivella to the tank, and were continued at varying intervals
over a six day period.
The results of this study are displayed in Fig. 2. The
difference between the number of animals at the surface during
daylight (0600 - 2000 inclusive) and those up at night, pooling
data for the whole period, is statistically significant at the
99% level. However, this includes the combined effects of
light and low tide during the day vs high tide and darkness at
night. By excluding all daylight observations taken after
0800 and before 1400, day vs night high tide conditions can be
compared. "Using these data, the difference between the average
mber of animals up during the day vs those up at night is
still significant at the 99% level. There seemed to be differences
Margaret Stetson
in activity between sunny periods and periods of fog or dusk
on May 9(0800 and 1600), May 10( 1800 and 1600), and May 16
(0800 and 1200). These suggest the orthokenetic light response
postulated by Edwards (1969). Were this experiment to be
repeated, more useful data could be obtained by a) elimination
of tidal vatiations, and b) setting observation times at
critical periods, eg. noon, midnight, and one hour before and
after sunrise and sunset.

LABORATORY STUDIES
In order to quantify the effects of light on activity of
Olivella biplicata and to determine the existence of a biological
clock, several laboratory experiments were undertaken. In all
experiments, animals were kept in 17.5 x 10.5 x 10 in. aquaria,
supplied with fresh running seawater at about 1'C above ambient
sea temperature. Simulated daylight was provided by four
General Electric flourescent lights (F48712 Cool White, High
Output), suspended 16 inches above the aquaria. Animals were
xamined periodically; readings in darkness were made in red

light using a Starlite Illuminator with link and variable
transformer (A0 - model 865, 115 VAC, 60 cycles, 2.75 amps)
set at 5.5v, using a G.E. (1480) bulb screened by a Corning
filter, number 243(minimum transmission at 610 nm, midpoint
at 630 nm, peak at 660 nm). This light source was shown in
preliminary tests to have no effect on the activity of the
subjects. All animals used were 1.5 to 3.Ocm in shell length.

Locomotor activity in light and darkne
The larger numbers of animals above the sand surface at
night suggests greater, or at least more wide-ranging, locomotor
activity during darkness. To see whether this was the case, a
comparative study of displacement under conditions of light and
dark was made. Fifty individuals were collected at lower low
water on May 8 at the sheltered cove of the Boatworks Beach.
These were divided between two aquaria, one with constant
flourescent illumination, the other kept in darkness. Each
tank was covered on the bottom with sand to a depth of three
inches, and was partitioned into a labyrinth of four compartments
or boxes, incompletely separated by vertical sheets of glass
(Fig. 3, top). All animals were initially placed in Box 1 of
each tank, and their subsequent positions were checked at
intervals over the next three hours. In the lighted tanks,
animals could be detected by the positions of their siphons
above the sand, In the dark tanks it was necessary to locate
the burrowed animals by "feel".
The results indicate clearly that displacement with time
was greater in the dark tanks than in those in the light. The
number of animals remaining in Box 1 after 3.5 hrs was significantly
greater (958 level) in light than in the dark. The experiment
suggests that, in darkness, not only are more snails found on
the sand surface, but their locomotor activity is greater.
There is some possibility that "feeling" in the dark tanks
stimulated these animals to greater movement, and that the
greater displacement here might be due in part to this. Should
Margaret Stetson
this experiment be repeated, I suggest using a shallower layer
of sand on the bottom, and perhaps providing each snail with
a trailing marker which would project above the sand,
Experiments with circadian rhythms:
The presence of a fairly consistent rhythm of activity
with respect to light and dark suggests the possibility of a
biological clock. Several experiments were set up to test for
the presence of a circadian rhythm and to attempt entrainment
by an artificial light-dark cycle.
Constant darkness
Two sea water tanks, both provided with approximately
three inches of sand from the area of sample collection and

with continuous flows of fresh sea water, were set up in a
darkroom with alternating periods of light and darkness. The
light period for both tanks corresponded approximately to that
of a normal day, with lights on at 0800 and off at 2000 hrs.
Each tank received 70 Olivella, collected at lower low water
on April 30 from the protected sandy cove on the Boatworks
Beach. After 6 days, one tank continued as a control, with
alternating 12 hr periods of light and dark, while the other
was left in constant darkness. Observations were continued for
another 6 days. During the entire 12 day period tanks were
observed at intervals, both day and night, and at each observation
the number of animals at the surface (both mating and single
animals) was recorded.
The results are shown in Fig. 4. For the first 6 days,
both tanks show clear daily cycles of activity correlated with

differs significantly (98% level, using the Yates correction
for X and excluding mating pairs). The dark period, in this
and subsequent analyses, was considered to include observations
from 2100 to 0800 hrs and the light period from 0900 to 2000 hrs.
since readings at 0800 and 2000 hrs were made just as the lights
went on or off. There is some evidence that the animals
anticipate the dark period; comparison of average numbers of
animals above the sand at 1200 and 2000 hrs during the entraining
period was significant at the 97.58 level. For the animals in
lank 2; during the period of continual darkness, the graphs in
Tig. 4 reveal a fairly clear retention of day-night oscillations
in activity, coinciding with those of the controls. However.
a greater number of animals are at the surface 0900 - 2000 hrs
than in the control, and day-night differences between the
numbers of animals above the surface at day and those on the
surface in the preceeding night, are significant at the 958
level only for May 15 and 17.
Reversal of day-night regime
periment was designed to test the possibility

rocedures were like those just described, except for the
reversed light regime. The animals were collected at lower
Margaret Stetson
low water on May 8 from the sheltered cove on the Boatworks
Beach.
The results are shown in Fig. 5. The difference between
average numbers of animals above the sand in light and dark
periods is significant at the 99.998 level for the entrainment
period, although there is no obvious consistent anticipation
of the light or dark periods. A continuation of oscillations
in activity corresponding to the zeitgeber (Aschoff, 1965) is
apparent, although the differences between number
s above sand
during the day and at night is not significant.
Additional experiments with numbered individuals showed
fairly regular circadian rhythms in several individuals.
However, these data were not complete enough to offer an
entirely accurate picture of an individual's activity.
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Aquaria : PartialExact'>Aquaria experiments</span> with a simulated tide were set up as
well. Data suggests a response to low water levels but,
due to insufficient controls and a presence of too many envir-
onmental variables, results for these experiments were somewhat
irregular.
Mating Behavior
In attempt to determine whether the number of mating pairs
was greater under conditions of light or conditions of dark-
ness, control data for the constant darkness experiment
(Fig. 4, top) were analyzed. Mean values of pooled data for
numbers of mating snails in total light and total dark periods
were compared using the Yates correction for Xe. The dif-
ference in numbers of mating pairs at night and during the day
Margaret Stetson
was not significant.
DISCUSSION
The erratic burrowing behavior of Olivella biplicata and
lack of equipment permitting continuoys monitoring of activity
make the investigation of the existence of a circadian rhythm

in this organism diiricult. In spite of these factors, both
field studies and experimental results indicate a definite
light:dark periodicity in the activity of Olivella biplicata.
Retainment of these oscillationsunder conditions of constant
darkness, after being subjected to a light: dark regime, sug-
gest the presence of a circadian rhythm.

could be of considerable ecological importance as suggested
by J.T. Enright (1970). Although environmental stimuli re-
present the dominant determinants of most behavior, an endogen-
ous rhythmic pattern could
provide the organism with
a temporary inertia in times of environmental dis
ruptance.
the selective advantage of this behavior can be inferred, al-
though the behavior of this particular organism appear
s to be
tremely complex.
