Behavioral Interactions Between Copepods and Sea Anemones
The average number of copepods observed on inhabited anemones is also
shoun.
Lab Observations
All copepods observed appeared to be cyclopoids (Brady, 1880).
The copepods appeared fully developed and no larvae were observed during
the course of the six week experiment. The copepods are poor swimmers
with legs adapted mainly for crawling on the surface of the anemone.
As copepods crawl over the surface of the anemone, the tentacles move
slightly in response to the tactile stimulus, but no feeding response
is evoked. The large 2mm copepods are capable of rapid movement, but
move infrequently; remaining stationary for up to 2 hours. The 1 mm
copepods are characterized by rapid movements over the entire anemone
surface, rarely remaining stationary for more than a minute.

Advantages to Host and Copepod
To determine if the copepods eat anemone tissue or mucus, excised
tentacles were stained in methylene blue for 40 minutes until both
the tentacle and surrounding mucys were dark blue. A white copepod
placed on the stained preparation in fresh seawater for 24 hours.

At the end of the 24 hour period, the copepod's gut had turned a pale
blue, indicating stained material had been injested. Squash preparations
copepods revealed no signs of nematocysts in the copepods.
To defermine if copepods are dependent upon the anemones for sur¬
vival, six copepods were kept isolated from anemones in fresh seawater.
All six copepods died within 10 days. Two of the six died within three
days. Dead copepods were never observed on anemones or in tanks con¬
taining commensal anemones. Other data indicate dead copepods are not
eaten by the host.
