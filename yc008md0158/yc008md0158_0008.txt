Behavioral Interactions Between Copepods
and Sea Anemones
the pharynx, which is also red. The copepods maintained these
positions for two hours, when the experiment was terminated.
4) Cueing Towards the Anemone
In the field it was noted that often an anemone with few or
copepods could be found less than three feet away from an
anemone with over 50 copepods. This observation led me to ques¬
tion the method by which copepods spread to new anemones, and how
they come to inhabit anemones only of a particular species.
Four T. lofotensis were placed in seperate tanks that were
entirely white so any movements of copepods off the anemones could
be easily observed. Copepods were then placed in the tank at
distances from one to seven centimeters away. The time taken for
copepods to move to the anemones was recorded.
When placed in the tanks, copepods appeared to swim in a random
manner, or else to merely settle to the bottom of the tank.
there appeared to be no orienting behavior unless the copepod was
brought within .5 cm. of the anemone or actually touched to the
anemone. If brought this close, the copepod would quickly move
to the anemone.
In another experiment, a commensal T. lofotensis was placed
cm. away from a. noncomménsal. Observations were made daily
for
three weeks to determine if any copepods had moved to the
copepodless anemone.
It was found that copepods never spread to the uninhabited
anemone, nor were copepods ever observed swimming off of the
comménsal anemone.
