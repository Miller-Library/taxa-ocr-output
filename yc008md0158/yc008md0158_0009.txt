Behavioral Interactions Between Copepods and Sea Anemor
Discussi
Copepods appear to be commensal on the anemones. Experiments finding
that copepods injest anemone mucus, and die when isolated suggest
that the copepods could be dependent upon the anemone mucus for surÂ¬
vival. The anemones, on the other hand, do not appear to benefit nor
be harmed in any way by the presence of copepods. Being unable to
capture and eat these copepods, the only benefit the anemone might
derive from the relationship would be a removal or cleaning of mucus.
It appears that copepods do not directly eat the food an anemone captures.
Copepods do not travel into the coelenteron, and if they become coated
with the fluids of a captured prey, they may be stung and captured
by the anemone.
The behavior of the anemone is not appreciably modified by the
presence of copepods. Although sensitive to the tactile stimulus of
the copepod, the anemone appears unable to discharge nematocysts, and
does not display the vigorous movements characteristic of a feeding
response. The anemone is not, however, unable to capture all animals
the size of copepods; quickly siezing and injecting animals of similar
or even smaller size.
These copepods show both species specific habitation and immunit,
except when associated with the genus Anthopleura, where the same
copepods are immune to both species. It seems interesting that the
two species of Anthopleura seem more alike in terms of copepod immunity
than
the three species of Tealia. The copepods found on A.elegantissima
and A. xanthogrammica were indistinguishable from each other and were
immune on either Anthopleura species. The three Tealia species, however,
