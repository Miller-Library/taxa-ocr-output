Behavioral Interactions Between Copepods and Sea Anemones
same species without harm to the copepods. Anemones from the same
or different areas did not react to intraspecific transfers of
copepods, even if they were previously noncommensal. Anemones
did react to interspecific transfers of copepods, with the excep-
tion of copepod transfers made between Anthopleura elegantissima
and Anthropleura xanthogrammica. In all other transfers, the anemone
elicited a vigorous feeding response toward the copepod, and the cope-
pod displayed escape behavior.
Species Specific Zonation
Preliminary field observation of Tedia lofotensis and T. crassi-
cornis indicated that copepod species were located where their color
matched that of the aneomone. Seven T. lofotensis were collected
and observed in the lab for a period of three weeks. The anemones
were divided into five zones (actinopharynx, oral disc, tentacle base,
tentacles, and column) and copepods of each type were counted and
their locations recorded. Because T. crassicornis did poorly in
the lab, zonation studies were done in the field. Twenty T. crassicornis
were observed on two separate dives. Because of inaccuracy in counting
copepods while diving, the anemones were divided into only three zones
(oral disc, tentacles, and column).
The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. They show that
T. lofotensis, the red copepods are found primarily on the tentacles,
were they are the same color as the anemone. White copepods show a
preference for the tentacle base area and the tentacles, but show no
preference between the two areas, which are of different colors.
In the lab, seven red copepods were placed on the oral disc of a
lofotensis, which is a brownish-green in color. Within 30 minutes
five had moved to the tentacles, which are red, and two had moved onto
