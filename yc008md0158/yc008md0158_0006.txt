Behavioral Interactions between Copepods and Sea Anemones
Lab and field observations were conducted in an attempt to determine
if the anemones benefited or were harmed by the presence of copepods.
tab observations were made for capture and injesting of copepods by
anemones, and dead copepods were fed to anemones to see if they would
pe eaten. Visual comparisons were made in the field between anemones
with and anemones without copepods.
There were no observed differences in appearance between commensal
and noncommensal anemones. Anemones were never observed to capture
their copepods, or copepods that had died and were fed to the anemone.
Copepods that had been crushed were quickly captured and injested.
Feeding experiments were conducted to determine if the anemone's
feeding behavior was modified by the presence of copepods, and to ob-
serve copepod behavior during anemone feeding. It was found that the
presence of copepods did not hinder the anemone's ability to capture
other prey the size of copepods. Tigriopus were instantly captured
and injested by the anemones. When anemones feed of large prey, copepods
are observed to move away from the area where the prey is captured.
At no time were copepods seen on the captured food, or going into or
out of the coelenteron. Copepods that had been coated with limpet
juices were captured and injested by the anemone.
2) Extent of Copepod Immunity
Copepods found on the same anemone species appeared to be species
specific. Several transfers of copepods among anemones of the same
species as the host and among anemones of different species were conducted.
It was found that copepods from all six different species of
anemones were able to be transferred to other anemones of the
