Sehavioral Interactions Between Copepods and Sea Anemones
found on subtidal A. elegantissima, and white copepods were found at
the white bases of T. coriacea tentacles. The manner in which the
copepods assumed the color of the anemone was not determined. No larvae
were observed in lab, so their color is not known. It was shoun,
however, that the copepods cannot change color within one week. Red
copepods that were either isolated or placed on white tentacles never
showed a color change. Copepod predation was never observed in the field
but certain fish and crustacea are often in close association with
anemones. This color matching might afford the copepods some prote
tion against these predators. (Ross, 1974)
It is intriguing that none of the copepods worked with display
visual or chemical cueing towards an anemone at a distance greater
than .5 cm. This would indicate that the spread of copepods to new
anemones is accomplished during another stage in the copepod's life
cycle. (Dudley, 1966). It would be interesting to know the method
in which the copepod larvae seek out specific species of anemones.
