Behavioral Interactions Between Copepods and Sea Anemones.
Abstract
The behavioral interactions between copepods (species?) and
six species of anemones (Tealia lofotensis, Tealia crassicornis,
Tealia coriacea, Anthopleura elegantissima, Anthopleura xantho-
grammica, and Epiactus prolifera) were examined. Lab and field
studies over a six week period showed that the copepods feed on
anemone mucus and are dependant on the anemone for survival.
Mature copepods were found to inhabit anemone species specifically.
It was also found that copepods showed species specific zonation
on the anemone; occupying areas where their color matched that
the anemone. Adult copepods failed to visually or chemically
cue
to anemones.
Introduction
Copepods were observed to be ectocommensal with six species
of anemones; Tealia lofotensis, Tealia crassicornis, Tealia cori-
acea, Anthopleura elegantissima, Anthopleura xanthogrammica, and
Epiactus prolifera. (Hand, 11956). Observations of copepods in the
field and in the lab raised several questions concerning anemone-
copepod behavioral relationships.
What are the advantages that may accrue to the host and
1)
symbiont from this relationship?
2) Are copepods protected against nematocyst discharge
from anemones of a species other than their host; and are
they protected from other anemones of the same species as
their host?
