shavioral Interactions Between Copepods and Sea Anemones
Are there particular zones of the anemone that the copepods
inhabit species specifically?
4) Do the copepods display any host recognition through
chemical or visual cues?
Each question was approached in a series of experiments.
The results of all these experiments will be discussed together
in an attempt to present a broad overview of the behavioral rela-
tionship.
Methods and Materials
All animals were collected in the Monterey bay area during
the month of May, 1975. The locations of the collection sites
are shown in figure 1. Anemones were removed from the substrate
with a scraper, and sealed in seperate jars to prevent the escape
of copepods during transport back to the lab. All anemones were
kept in acquaria in the lab, with a constant flow of fresh seawater.
Only
anemones that were attached, expanded and sensitive to stimuli
were used in lab experiments.
Field Observations
able 2 lists the different types and locations of anemones
collected with copepods. Copepods generally were more abundant
on subtidal anemones, and were never found on anemones above
mean lower low water mark.
Table 2 also describes the types of copepods found on the
different anemones.
The species of the copepods are not known,
but are designated as distinct by size and color. Table 2 shows
the percentage of anemones with copepods at the different locations.
