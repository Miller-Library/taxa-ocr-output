and antennae. The second antennae have also been observed
snagging escaping food partioles. Crabs without second antennae
showed a slight tendency to extend their walking legs wider and
further in front of them than unoperated crabs.
No evidence for chemotaxis in the two species of Pagurus was
found. Even intaot orabs do not exhibit a directed response,
either to food, in the form of mussel or snail meat, or to such
chemicals as acetic acid, beta alanine, quinine, dextrose, maltose,
sucrose, or lactose. In no case was andescape response to a
predator found. Blinded crabs showed no response to food dropped
directly in front of them.
There was no apparent left or right preference, either in
intact crabs of crabs without one or both first and second antennae.
The number of crabs tested ranged from 25 to 35 per group, with
a total of 442 orabs tested in all.
Figure 1 shows the results of the rheotactic tests. Positive
rheotactio response is virtually eliminated in P. granosimanus
lacking either all of the first antennae, or the brushes of the first
antennae. Extirpation of only the right or left first antenna
also showedd√• lowered number of positive responses; out of twenty
trials five crabs gave a positive response only 60 per cent of
the time without the right antennule, and without the left
antennule the same number gave 65 per cent positive responses.
Extirpation of the second antennae or of the maxillipeds had
no effect. P. samuelis, on the other hand, shows no such loss of
rheotaxis with removal of the first antennae. The P. samuelis
