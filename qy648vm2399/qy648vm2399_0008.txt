greater exposure, may have lost all current sensitivity except
in the antennules. P. samuelis may have body hairs which are
current sensitive, or it may simply react to pressures on its
shell. A neurophysiological investigation is the next logical
step.
Summary
lons of the first and second
A behavioral study of th
antennae of Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis was made.
The primary method was extirpation and comparison with intact
crabs. No chemotazis or lefteright preference was observed.
Rheotaxis was found to occur in both species, but antennular
involvement was only evident in Pagurus samuelis.
