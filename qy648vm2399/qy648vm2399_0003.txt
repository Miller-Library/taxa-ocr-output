statocysts did not appear to hamper a crab particularly, but
such crabs were very slow to return to their shells.
In attempts to demonstrate chemoreception, a technique sim-
ilar to that described by Barber (1961 ) was used. Blotters
were impregnated with the various test solutions and added to a
basin containing the crabs to be tested. Food, such as fresh-
crushed Mytilus edulis or Tegula funebralis, was also added to
tidepools and tanks, and observations made.
To examine left-right tendencies Ã¥ "Y" of rocks was set up
in a tank and orabs were individually tested for possible
directional preferences. To avoid light effects, these tests were
performed indoors and the tank was turned around after each trial
and the orab tested again. Each crab was tested at least twice.
For the rheotactio studies, a procedure similar to that
used by Luther (1930) was followed. A glass dish approximately
15 centimeters in diameter was anchored in the center of a larger
glass dish approximately 30 centimeters in diameter, to provide
a convenient channel in which currents could be easily produced and
reversed with a direoted stream of water. Each crab was tested
four to five times in succession by means of reversing the eurrent
when a response was elicited. When the crab did not respond to
the current change after two revolutions about the dish, the
current was reversed and the lack of response recorded. The
normal response of both P. granosimanus and P. samuelis to a
current is to move into it, at first facing the current, then,
as the strength of the current increases, turning sideways, and
