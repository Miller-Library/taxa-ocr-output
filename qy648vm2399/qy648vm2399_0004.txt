finally, backing into the current in short hops. When the crab
can no longer move against the current, he relaxes and is carried
to a point where he can again move against it. In this paper,
such behavior is considered a positive rheotactic response.
Results
Crabs lacking antennae appear able to lead close to normal
lives, and recover quickly from the operation. Mortality was
not noticeably heightened in the operated crabs and most survived
at least five weeks in the laboratory. Operated crabs did show
an increase in aggressive behavior toward other crabs, however,
and were slow in returning to their shells after operation. There
was no appreciable differenoe in the dispersal times of operated
and intact crabs, but operated crabs exhibited less exploratory
behavior than intact crabs. Crabs without second antennae were
especially non-exploratory.
It was gener√•lly observed that the second antennae are closely
to visual activity, being stimulated by sight into an exploratory
and tactile response. The antennae are quickly withdrawn on contaot
with objects, and are seen to follow objects passed in front of the
orab, even from the other side of a glass partition. Blinded
crabs dod not exhibit such a following response, although they do
avoid objects and other crabs. Grabs which were blinded and
without either pair of antennae also avoided objects in their paths
without any apparent bodily contact, however, which would
indicate a complex sensory system involving more than just the eyes
