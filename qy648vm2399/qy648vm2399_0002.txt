Introduction
The very prominent and active first and second antennae of
the various species of Pagurus, make them an obvious subject for
a functional behavioral study. The lack of literature and the
many contradictions in what literature there is on the subject,
also encourages such a study. This paper will attempt to explore
some of the possibilities of such a problem; particularly with
respect to chemoreception, rheotaxis, and taotile reception.
Studies were made at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacifio Grove,
California, during April and May of 1965. Two species of
Pagurus, P. Samuelis and P. granosimanus, were used. Both
species are common in the intertidal regions around China Point,
Monterey Bay, with P. granosimanus found slightly lower insthe
intertidal where it is subjected to stronger currents than P.
samuelis.
Methods
The primary method employed was direct observation of intact
crabs, both in the field and in the laboratory, and later of
crabs subjected to various extirpations of antennae and other
appendages. Operations were performed on unanesthetized crabs
which had been poked out of their shells with a probe, after a
hole had been hammered in the side of the shell. Crabs were
allowed to return to their shells immediately after the operations,
which were performed with a pair of fine scissors. Antennules
were removed down to the first articulation next to the statocyst,
and in one group the statocysts were also removed. Removal of the
