crabs were much slower to respond to the current when a response
was observed, however, than were the P. granosimanus. A total of
110 crabs were tested, and within each group there was a
remarkable consistency of response. It was also noted that both
species of Pagurus continually align their antennules into currents,
even when backing into them. Brock (1930 ) found similar
behavior in Carcinus maenas.
Discussion
In studies on chemoreception in other decapods, Hodgson ( 1958),
and Case and Gwilliam ( 1961 ) found little evidence for
chemoreception by either pair of antennae, but did find very
sensitive receptors on the dactyls of the walking legs. In the
present study, no evidence for a directing chemoreceptive organ
was found, but in tests with glaeial acetic acid it was noted
that the dactyls and mouth parts were apparently more sensitive
than other parts of the crab. The fine brush structure of the
antennules and their orientation with currents would make them
a logical chemoreceptive organ, but no indication of such a function
was found in this study.
The most interesting results were those on rheotaxis. It
was a surprise to find that two animals of the same genus, living
at times in the same tidepool, should display such a difference
in rheotactic behavior. Luther (1963 ) found similar differences
between certain decapod genera, though. P. granosimanus is found
in areas of stronger current than is P. samuelis,which may help
to explain the difference. P. granosimanus, because of its
