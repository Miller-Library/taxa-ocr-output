INTRODUCTION
The widespread use of insecticides and their accumula-
tion in the environment has prompted several studies on the
effects of these pesticides on the activity of soil micro-
organisms.
Jones(3) reported no inhibition of ammonification, nitrifi-
cation, or the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds by DDT,
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenylethane), at levels between
0.O1 and 0.001 per cent. Inhibition was observed at levels of
0.1 per cent. These studies were carried out using soil samples
incubated in open containers for periods up to three years.
Similarly, he found no effect upon nitrogen fixation even at
DDT levels as high as 1.0 per cent.
A more recent study by Bartha et al.(1) indicated no in-
hibition of aerobic oxidation of glucose in soil samples con-
taining 150 parts per million DDT. Nor was an effect observed on
the process of nitrification at this concentration of DDT,
although DDE was observed to have a stimulatory effect at the
same concentration. In neither the studies of Jones nor Eartha
was an attempt made to account for the loss of DDT from the
preparations by codistillation during the lengthy incubation
periods
The present study was made using elective cultures, with
2
-2-
sodium acetate as a carbon source and either oxygen or nitrate
as a terminal electron acceptor. The use of such preparations
allowed a study of growth as well as metabolic activity, and a
more precise control of DDT concentration during experiments.
In addition, the range of concentrations of DDT used in this
study is comparable to that of the environment. In areas not
subjected to the repeated application of insecticides, residues
as high as 20 ppm have been found(7); while in orchard soils
subjected to regular application of pesticides, residues have
been reported as high as 60 ppm(5).
METHODS
The medium used elects from soil innocula organisms cor-
responding to aerobic pseudomonads and, with the addition of
nitrate, similar bacteria capable of denitrification. The
medium contained 0.036% NahpPO H2o, 0.07% KpHPOL, 0.05% Mgson.
0.005% Cacl», 0.005% Fecl3, and 0.5% NacH302. For aerobic
cultures 0.12 NHLCI was added to the above, the pH adjusted to
7.0; for anaerobic cultures, 0.2% KNO3 was added, the pH ad-
justed to 7.5.
Garden soil was used as an initial innoculum, and in-
cubation was carried out at 28 C.. Sub-culturing was necessary
to maintain actively growing cultures.
Growth experiments were carried out in sidearm Erlenmeyer
flasks containing the medium and DDT in concentrations ranging
from ,02 to 200 ppm. Cultures were innoculated, and turbidity

using a green filter. Sterile blanks were prepared similarly,
A stock solution of DDT--obtained from the Aldrich Chemical
Co., Inc--was prepared by dissolving 1.0 gram in 100 ml. of 958
ethanol. Necessary dilutions were carried out using distilled
water in most cases. The highest final concentration of ethanol
in any of the cultures was 2.0%; no effect upon growth was noticed
at this level.
Respiration of aerobic cultures was measured manometrically
at 30'C. in Warburg flasks containing 0.036% NaH»PO'H,O, 0.07%
KoHPO, and 0.5% NaCH0, as a carbon source.
RESULTS
The elective cultures developed rapidly within 24 hours
and produced a water soluble, green, flourescent pigment, charac-
teristic of members of the genus <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pseudomonas : Exact'>Pseudomonas.</span> The appearance of
aerobic and anaerobic cultures was identical.
Figure 1 presents the growth of the aerobic cultures in
the presence of 0, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, and 200 ppm DDT. A lower
growth rate and less total growth was observed with increasing
concentrations of DDT. Anaerobic cultures, Fig, 2, exhibited
no growth inhibition by DDT, the growth rates and total growth
being comparable in the three concentrations used.
The measurement of growth by turbidity was made diffscult
by the turbidity of DDT at concentrations of 20 ppm and above,
The effect upon growth should therefore be confirmed by additional

methods of measurement.
No effect upon respiration was detected over this same
range of DDT concentrations in the aerobic cultures.
DISCUSSION
This study is only preliminary. Earlier investigations in-
dicated an effect by DDT only at much higher concentrations, e.g.
exceeding 1 per cent. DDT may affect the growth of bacteria at
much lower concentrations which are not uncommon in unsprayed areas,
e.g. 20 and 200 ppm, or .002 and .02 per cent.
The absence of any effect on anaerobic pseudomonads requires
further investigation. Wedemeyer(6) has found that <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aerobacter aerogenes : Exact'>Aerobacter
aerogenes</span> can dechlorinate DDT under anaerobic conditions, but
che process is hindered greatly in the presence of oxygen.
tenersen obtained similar results with <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E. coli(4),</span> and a study
by Guenzi and Beard(2) showed that C+ DDT incubated anaerobically
in soil was broken down to DDD, DDE, and other derivatives.
Whether the pseudomonads, during the process of denitrification,
are also capable of altering the structure of DDT has yet to be
determined.
SUMMARY
Growth of aerobic pseudomonads in elective cultures was
significantly inhibited by DDT in concentrations as low as 2
ppm. Anaerobic cultures showed no inhibition by DDT even at
200 ppm. No effect upon aerobic respiration was detected.
