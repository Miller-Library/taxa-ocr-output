Photomicrographs from light (Fig. 1A) and SEM (Fig. 1B) examin¬
aton of longitudinal smooth muscle bundles revealed long, thin parallel
fibers of 1044 diameter (Fig. 1A) which could be followed in longi¬
tudinal sections continuously for up to 1 mm before disappearing
out of the section making exact determination of length inconclusive.
It is possible that individual cells might run the full length of the
muscle bands, but they might also terminate somewhere in the middle of
the bundle. In cross sections (not illustrated), groups of roughly
50 individual muscle cells were observed to be arranged in small bundles
of about 50 u diameter, each bundle being surrounded by a thin layer of
connective tissue. Such a bundle can be visualized in Fig. 14. At the
next level of organization, several bundles were enclosed by a cellular
epithelial - type sheath which could largely be removed by dissection,
This sheath can be seen at the top of Fig. 14. In Fig 1B, the sheath has
been slit open and pinned out in the upper left corner of the figure.
Thus, the inner surface of the sheet is seen in Fig:lB.
Individual muscle cells in the smaller bundles appeared to be covered
with spheroid or obloid grape - like cells of up to 5 u diameter.
Whether these cells were actually a separate cell type or simply evagin¬
ations of the muscle cell membrane could not be unequivocally determined,
but the total lack of red staining inside these cells in sharp contrast
to the muscle cells points to a different cell type (Fig. 1B). The
function of these glial - like cells is totally unknown.
When stimulated with a brief shock, bundles of muscle cells responded
with a vigorous twitch. Fig. 2A shows such a twitch and the recorded
action potential which triggered it. Although the action potential
