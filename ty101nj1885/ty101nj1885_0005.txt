In order to ascertain the mechanism by which external Ca regulates
contractile activation, effects of several Ca channel blockers were
studied. If Ca channels were directly associated with poopagation of the
action potential, action potentials and twitches ought to fail if the
channels are blocked. Table 1 indicates changes in twitch and tetanus
force in muscles exposed to a variety of Ca and Na blockers. Complete
removal of external Na (Tris replaced) or application of 104 tetrodoÂ¬
toxin had no inhibitory effect on muscle contractability. Na free Tris
ASW actually promoted a 40% increase in twitch magnitude with no noticdble
difference in tetanic force. Likewise, 2.5 mM Verapamil was totally
ineffective. The polyvalent cations, Cd and La2 resulted in gradual
decay of excitabllity to zero twitch force over a time course comparable
to that previously documented for 0 Ca-EGTA solutions (Fig. 34).
Moreover, some preliminary experiments administering Ba to preparations in
10 Ca ASW or following Ca depletion in O Ca EGTA solutions for two
hours resulted in dramatically increased excitability, with twitches
growing in amplitude and becomming very prolongued.
Based on these results with divalent cations, it is clear that Ca
must be the primary external cation involved in rapid propagation of the
action potential of the smooth muscle of Ciona intestinalis. Thus, it
is not surprising that contraction fails in 0 Ca. Neither a Ca influx
underlying the action potential nor sufficient depolarization to
release internally sequestered Ca is possible under these currcumstances.
Consequently, further experimentation was geared towerds uncovering the
sourfe of Ca ions involved in activating the contractile machinery in
the muscle cells. Specifically, the question of whether, sarcoplasmic
vesicles which can release Ca in response to depolarization in the absence
