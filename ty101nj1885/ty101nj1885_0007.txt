Nevitt 8
Discussion
From the evidence presented here, it is proposed that Ca sequestering/
releasing vesicles are not present in the smooth muscle of Ciona intestinalis
All Ca necessary to activate the contractile mechanism must therefore be
derived from extracellular Ca.
Electrical measurements are needed to show more directly the role
of Ca in propagating the action potential. Specifically, is Ca the
only ion involved and if so, can enough Ca enter the cell to activate
a twitch?
Likewise, more detailed morphological study is necessary to approach
the more critical question of the existence of sarcoplasmic vesicles
and to deduce the anatomical relationship between the smooth muscle cells
and the grape-like structures which surround them. It seems valikely
that these structures are simply evaginations of the muscle cell
membrane whether these structures are separate cells or are simply
evaginations of the muscle cell membrane appearing at short muscle
lengths (see 7) is still unknown.
