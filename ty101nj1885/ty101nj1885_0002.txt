Nevitt 3
Mature specimens of Ciona intestinalis were collected from the
harbor in Monterey Bay, California. Longitudinal muscle bands of
.1-.5 mm diameter were dissected in a standard artificial sea water
(ASW) containing 10 mM Cacl,, 60 Mm MgCl,, 10 mM KCl, 460 mM Nacl,
and 10 mM Tris. Light microscopic studies were made on paraffin embedded, 8 u
sectioned preparations fixed with Helly's and stained with Mallory's
Azan (5). Preparations for examination by scanning electron micro¬
scopy (SEM) were pinned out and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde,,1% formal¬
dehyde and 7.2% Hepes in filtered sea water. For physiological ex¬
periments, preparations were mounted at near their in vivo resting length
in a 5 ml chamber with a sylgard floor. One end of the bundle was
pinned to the floor; the other was attached to a Pixie element (Endevcc
Corp.) force transducer as described by Gilly (6). Ag/AgCl electrodes
were placed at either end of the chamber and 60-100 V shocks of 2 ms
duration were applied either singly (twitch), or at a rate of 40/sec
(tetanus). Action potentials were recorded using a glass suction
micropipette applied against the outer surface of the muscle preparation.
Solutions employed were derived from the standard ASW in such a manner
as to keep ionic strength constant. Thus, Nacl was appropriately re¬
duced to accommodate high divalent cation levels and Tris Cl or KCl
totally replaced Nacl on an equimolar basis. O Ca solutions were
prepared omitting Ca and adding 5 mM EGTA and 60 mM MgCl.. All drugs were
obtained from Sigma Chemicals.
