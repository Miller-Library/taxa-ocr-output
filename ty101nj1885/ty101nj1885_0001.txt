Although smooth muscle has been heavily investigated, the mech¬
anisms involved in regulation of contractile activation are not yet
well documented (+-2) Specifically, the question of whether or not smooth
muscle cells sequester calcium in intracellular vesicles analogous
to the sarcoplasmic recticulum in striated muscle, and whether this
Ca is released in response to depolarization to activate contraction
is controversial. An important difficulty in studying smooth muscle is
finding a preparation in which the muscle cells are arranged in such a
geometry as to allow quantitative interpretation of results from elec¬
tric al and mechanical studies. Most preparations are syncytiums of
small, branching cells arranged in complex geometries. However, the
troponin regulated smooth muscle cells of Ascidians (31)primitive
chordates, may be a useful model system for vertebrate smooth muscle..
We report here experiments on the longitudinal body wall muscles of
Ciona intestinalis using standard morphological and physiological methods.
The muscle cells are arranged in long parallel bundles which are easily
dissected and rapidly contract in response to electrical stimulation.
Relaxation is slow. Activation of action potentials and twitches are
critically dependant on external Ca, whereas extracellular Na shows no
effect on excitability. Contractile response to depolarization via action
potentials or KCl application dissappears at similar rates upon appli¬
cation of Ca free solutions. Our results do not support the existence
of intracellular stores of releasable Ca and suggest that Ca influx is
the sole source of activator Ca.
