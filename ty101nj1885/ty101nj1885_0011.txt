Figure 14
Light micrograph of bundle prepared with Mallory's Azan stain
showing the individual cell conformations. Muscle cells can be seen
running along the length of the section, coming together at the
apparent end of the muscle fiber bundle. Note the extracellular
epithelial sheath enclosing the muscle bundle.
Figure 1B
EM scan of a preparation of smooth muscle from Ciona intestinalis.
Note the relatively simple geometrical arrangement of the individual
cells into long bundles. Grape - like structures could be associated
with innervation or may simply be evaginations of the cell membrane.
Two fibers are visible. The cut fiber on the left illustrates
the large amount of shortening possible through contraction of these
bundles.
Figure 2A
Extracellularly recorded action potential and associated twitch; note
the rapid contraction and much slower rate of twitch relaxation compared
to the fast time course of the action potential.
Figure 2B
Twitch, tetanus and KCl contractures from the same muscle in ASW
containing 10 Ca.
Figure 3A
Time course changes in twitch and tetanus response to changes in
Ca concentrations. Note that tetanic force varies less than twitch
force when Ca is raised from 10 to 60 mM.
Figure 3B
Analysis of twitch (*) and tetanus (0) force as a function of
extracellular Ca concentration. Saturation of both occur near
60mM.
Figure 4
Rates of decline of twitch (), tetanus (2) and KCl (Â°) contractures in
going from 60 to O mM Ca ASW. Indicated time constants (t) show no
significant difference in rates of decay between tetani and KCl contractu
