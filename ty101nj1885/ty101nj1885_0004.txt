must last only about 10 ms and was found to propagate at a velocity of
about 300 cm/sec, the ensuing twitch is relatively much slower. Although
twitches were always elicited with super-maximal shocks, in a multi¬
cellular preparation such as this one, it is difficult to prove uniform
and complete propagation down the entire length. To ensure that the
muscle contractions were not simply due to local responses at the
cathodal end and/or dependent on polarity or placement of the electrodes
in the chamber, a control test was performed using a rambling cathode
mounted on a micromanipulator with anodes placed at both ends. Muscles
were stimulated at various positions along the length,and amplitude
and time course of twitch responses did not depend on the rambler's
position. We conclude that the action potential can propagate from end
to end, allowing nearly spontan?ous activation of the entire length of the
fiber. Figure 2B illustrates the relative sizes of twitch, tetanus, and
KCl contracture in the same muscle in ASW. Twitches are typically
much smaller than tetani, Tetani were at least half as large as KCl
responses. These relative amplitudes depend, however, on external Ca
as described below.
Manipulations of extracellular Ca clearly indicate that contractility
is determined by Ca level. Figure 3A illustrates this phenomenon:
twitch force (closed symbols) is rapidly elevated as extracellular Ca concen¬
trationis increased from 10 to 60 mM, whereas twitches more slowly
deteriorate as extracellular Ca drops to near zero in O Ca-5 mM EGTA
solution. Upon replacing external Ca, twitch height fully reverses.
Tetanic force (open symbols in Fig. 3A) varied similarly, but the increase
in going from 10 to 60 mM was far smaller than for a twitch. Figure 3B
shows a more complete analysis of twitch and tetanus height as a function
of externalCa over a range of 0-100 mM Ca. Both twitch and tetanus
