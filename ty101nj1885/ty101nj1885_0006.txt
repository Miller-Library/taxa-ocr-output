of Ca influx are present was addredsed.
Muscles were bathed in 60 mM Ca ASW until a stable level of tetanus
was attained. The solution was then changed to O Ca-EGTA (time zero in
Fig. 4). Twitches were recorded at regular intervals until no force
could be observed. This decline is plotted in Fig. 4 (indicated by
squares). Tetani (indicated by triangles) were then applied, again until
zero response was reached indicating an apparent total failure of
action potentials due to depletion of external Ca. At this time, appli¬
cation of KCl 0 Ca-EGTA showed a definite response (indicated with
arrow). Thus, two possibilities present themselves: (a) no vesicles as
postulated above were present and KCl depolarization allowed a small
influx ofresidualtexternal Ca, or (b) such vesicles were present and were
subject to a significantly slower depletion of Ca than was the extra¬
cellular space. If (b) were true, then action potential rundown as
monitored by decline of twitch and tetanus size would occur at a faster
rate than depletion of intracellular vesicles as monitored by KCl application.
In order to test this hypothesis, the experiment was repeated after
obtaining full recovery in high Ca, and O Ca-EGTA KCl was applied at different
O Ca soak times. Figure 4 shows the results of this experiment with four
different soak times and no significant difference between rates of decay
for tetanus or KCl contracture in the O Ca solution is indicated. Thus,
either no sarcoplasmic vesicles are present or any such sequestering
vesicles that do exist are so inefficient as to be depleted at the same rate
as extracellular Ca.
