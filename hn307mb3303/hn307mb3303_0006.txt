sufficient for further interpretation. Additional experiments
will be carried out in order to determine the mechanisms of DDT
uptake in Hermissenda.
DDT UPTAKE FROM FEEDING
A group of 14 Hermissenda were fed portions of C'' DDT
labelled Hermissenda and were the placed in 2 liters of clean
sea water. An additional 3 labelled Hermissenda were fed to a
single Navanax which was also placed in clean sea water. Feces
were removed from the container and analyzed, and water samples
were removed and analyzed periodically. At the end of 48 hours,
the Hermissenda were dissected into samples of total cerata,
viscera, and muscle tissue (foot and head). The Navanax was
likewise dissected and the tissues divided into separate samples.
The results of liquid scintilation counting of the samples
is presented in Table 2. Percentages are based on the total
'DDT recovered. Two results are evident: 1) the major fraction
of DDT in both cases was accumulated in the digestive glands;
2) the efficiency of DDT assimilation from food is high: 96% in
Hermissenda and 97% in Navanax. It is assumed that the label
recovered from the feces represents all that was lost from the
animals, since the water samples did not vary from background
over the entire period.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest that more DDT residues
are available to these organisms over time than are actually
accumulated, and that an equilibrium condition is reached
