of Hermissenda were analyzed separately; each class containing
enough animals to provide an optimal analytical sample weight
of 3 grams.
Concentrations vs. weight are shown in Figure 1. There is
a clear increase in the concentration of DDT residues with greater
weight. Though weight is presumably a rough indication of age,
it would not appear that this merely represents à oonstantly
increasing accumulation over the animal's life span. Since
Hermissenda have higher concentrations in areas with higher
environmental levels of DDT, the population sampled in this
experiment cannot have reached a saturation point. It seems
likely that a Hermissenda of any size will have consumed more
than five times its weight in hydroids, roughly the amount needed
to account for its level of DDT residues. It would then be retain¬
ing less than 100% of its intake and presumably be in an equilib-
rium condition. The increase must then be due to some other factor.
Experiments discussed later showed the cerata as the principal
site of at least short-term accumulation of DDT, and casual obser-
vations indicate that larger Hermissenda have relatively more
cerata. This may account for a greater lipid fraction in larger
animals, and thus a greater concentration, since values are based
on the weight of the entire animal. Even among Hermissenda of the
same approximate weight the number of cerata varies, and could
account for some of the scatter in the data. Further experiments
will be done to test these possibilities.
