FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Concentrations of DDT residues vs. weight of
Hermissenda. Each point is the value measured for a
sample composed of from 4 to 30 animals with weights
ranging over the.2 gram interval. Points are plotted
at the mean weight/animal in each sample.
Figure 2. Removal of C DDT from sea water by Bowerbankia.
The curves indicate increase of concentration of label in
the Bowerbankia (solid line) vs. decrease of the concen-
tration in the water.
Figure 3. Removal of C DDT from sea water by Hermissenda.
The curves indicate increase of concentration in Hermissenda
vs. decrease of concentration in water from an initial
calculated value of 50 PPT. The fluctuation was probably
due to varying temperature.

Table 1. Field concentrations of DDT residues in the food chain.
The number of animals measured (colonies in the case of the
bryozoan and hydroid) is noted along with the location.
All walues are based on wet weight.
No measurement was made of the water from Monterey Harbor.
Value here is very rough estimate based on values for
open ocean water.
** Condition of the GLC column did not allow quantification
of the DDT peak.
