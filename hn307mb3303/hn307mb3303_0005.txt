DDT UPTAKE FROM SOLUTION
Colonies of Bowerbankia, divided into 50 approximately
1 gram clumps, were placed in a glass container with 16 liters of
sea water. Ring-labelled C DDT dissolved in ethanol was added
to bring the initial concentration in the water to 100 parts per
trillion (PPT). Samples of Bowerbankia were removed at various
times and prepared as in the GLC analysis procedure, except for
the clean-up. Pigments were removed instead by shaking with
Nuchar Attaclay which was then removed by centrifugation. 10 ml
aliquots of the water were also taken at various times and extracted
by shaking with redistilled petroleum ether. Extracts, evaporated
to .5 ml and combined with 10 ml of scintilation fluid, were
counted in a Nuclear Chicago Unilux II scintilation counter.
In a similar experiment, 40 Hermissenda were placed in 40 liters
of sea water with an initial concentration of 50 PPT of C DDT,
and samples were removed and analyzed in the same manner over a
38 hour period.
The results of the two experiments are presented in Figure 2
and Figure 3. In both cases the rate of uptake decreases with
decreasing concentration in the water. Although the curves tend
to level off, it is difficult to tell at what point the systems
would have reached an equilibrium condition since the ratio between
concentration in the animals and concentration in the water
increased linearly with time in both cases over the periods
measured. Since various factors including an inconstant volume
of water per animal and competition for the available label
were not taken into account in this experiment, the data is not
