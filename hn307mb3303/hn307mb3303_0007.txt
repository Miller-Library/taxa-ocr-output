between the concentration level in the organism and the level
of DDT residues in its environment. The concentration in the
animal is dependent upon a number of variables determining rates
of uptake, retention and loss. A complete description of the
flow of DDT residues through this food chain will require eluci-
dation of the nature of the equilibrium in each trophic level.
This study will continue with the investigation of this problem
in Hermissenda.
