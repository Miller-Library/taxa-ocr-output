DDT residues are concentrated when transferred into higher
trophic levels. Although several studies deal with the kinetics
of DDT assimilation in a single organism, there is little research
that elucidates the details of DDT transfer through several steps
in a marine invertebrate food chain. 2 This study represents
some preliminary investigations of the transfer of DDT residues
in a 3-level epibenthic food chain comprised of Campanularian
hydroids, the eolid nudibranch Hermissenda crassicornis, and the
tectibranch Navanax interminis. There are three aspects to this
study: 1) measurements of field concentrations of DDT residues in
the organisms; 2) a determination of the kinetics of DDT uptake
from solution; 3) a determination of the efficiency of removal of
DDT from food and its storage sites in the organism.
Navanax were collected intertidally from White's Point on
the Palos Verdes Peninsula near Los Angeles, and from a depth of
10 feet in Los Angeles Harbor. Hermissenda were collected from
Los Angeles Harbor, from floating piers in the marina of Monterey,
California, and primarily the pilings of Pier #2 at Monterey from
depths of 2 to 25 feet. Sufficient quantities of the hydroid on
which Hermissenda were observed to feed could not be collected
for feeding and uptake studies. DDT residue concentrations were
determined in Obelia from the floating piers. Uptake studies
were with Bowerbankia gracilis, a bryozoan very abundant on pilings,
and on which the nudibranchs were generally found grazing on the
small hydroids interspersed among the stolons. Although Bowerbankia
probably constitutes a minimal portion of Hermissenda's diet, its
