surface to volume ratio, general structure, and feeding habits
are similar to those of hydroids, and DDT uptake is comparable
in the two.
FIELD CONCENTRATIONS
Samples, digested in 1:1 perchloric and glacial acetic acid,
were extracted with hexane. Extracts were cleaned-up using a
silica gel microcolumn to which 1% Nuchar Attaclay was added to
insure removal of pigments. Samples were injected into a Beckmann
GC-4 gas-liquid chromatograph equipped with an electron capture
detector.
The results are summarized in Table 1. The high value for
Hermissenda from Los Angeles Harbor is probably due to large inputs
of DDT into the nearby White's Point sewage outfall by the
Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, sole producers of DDT
in the U.S.% The value for Hermissenda from floating piers at
Monterey is a factor of 2.3 above the mean value for those obtained
from submerged pilings nearby. This suggests that these nudibranchs,
always near the surface, are exposed to more DDT, perhaps from
input into the surface layer from aerial fallout. The concentration
factors are expressed as the ratio between the concentration of
DDT residues in an organism and that of its food supply in its
particular location. The decreasing factor with high trophic
level may be a reflection of differing feeding habits, and additional
autecological information is needed to interpret this trend.
In order to determine a relationship between weight and DDT
concentration, weight classes of .2gram intervals from o to 1.8 gram
