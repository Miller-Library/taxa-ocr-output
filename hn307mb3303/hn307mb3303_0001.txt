Abstract
Preliminary investigations of several aspects of DDT
residue flow through the food chain were carried out using
DDT tracer. These consisted of measurement
GLC analysis and(
of field concentration levels, uptake from water, uptake through
feeding, and determination of accumulation sites. Results
indicate that more DDT is available to the organism over time
than is accumulated, suggesting an equilibrium of DDT residue
concentration between animal and environment. A thorough
description of DDT flow in the food chain will require more
detailed information on the kinetics at each level. The study
will continue with investigation of DDT kinetics in Hermissenda.
