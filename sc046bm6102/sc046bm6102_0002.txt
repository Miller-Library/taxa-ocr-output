INTRODUCTION
Kyl potassium channels are a diverse group of membrane-spanning
polypeptides found in most eukaryotic cells (Jan and Jan 1992). These
channels are voltage-gated delayed rectifiers and play a critical role in
termination of the action potential. Therefore, changing the functional
properties of these channels has implications for altering nerve signaling.
Voltage-gated potassium channels in the Kvl family share similar
structural features (Jan and Jan 1992). Kvlâ€™s are formed by four identical a-
subunits. A schematic representation of an a-subunit is shown in Figure 1.
The cytoplasmic N-terminal and C-terminal portions are hydrophilic, and the
middle of the polypeptide comprises the hydrophobic core region. The
emerging view of the channel from hydrophobicity analysis includes six
putative membrane spanning domains in the core region and a pore-loop (P-
loop) contained within the membrane. Amino acid identity within the Kvl
subfamily is highest within these domains, particularly in S4-S6 and the P-
loop.
The ability to use molecular approaches has rapidly advanced our
understanding of structure-function relationships of these channels, as
summarized by Jan and Jan (1992). For example, mutagenesis experiments
have revealed several functional domains in the channel protein. The
fourth membrane-spanning sequence, S4, is thought to be the intrinsic
voltage sensor of the molecule due to its unusual arrangement of positively
charged amino acids at every third residue. The P region, which is too short
