with histidyl residues which is not reversed by hydroxylamine. This leads to
the conclusion that use of excess DEPC may lead to imprecise quantitation
and hydroxylamine-resistant modification (Miles 1977). For this reason, it is
important that the lowest possible concentration of DEPC is used in
modification experiments. Concentration-dependence studies should be
done for each clone.
Site-specific mutagenesis studies of subtilisin have shown the
influence of neighboring charged groups on histidine ionization, and thus on
DEPC reactivity as well (Bycroft and Fersht 1988). This is another factor to
consider in designing future DEPC experiments on Kvl channels.
Additionally, future studies should test the effect of DEPC on the
cloned squid channel (SqKvlA) in a suitable heterological expression system
to confirm that SqkvlA is the delayed rectifier channel in the squid giant
axon.
What has been presented serves as a set of preliminary data which
inspire numerous further questions to be probed. Clearly histidine
modification leads to interesting changes in channel properties, but it seems
that the modification reactions are complex and involve multiple target sites.
It is hard to conclude with certainty that DEPC acts on particular residues
without addressing many concerns with regards to DEPC modification itself,
including the pH range for imidazole protonation, DEPC modification of
non-histidine residues, and concentration dependence of DEPC modification.
