residue were expressed in HEK 293 cells and assayed for sensitivity to 0.5 mM
DEPC. A comparison of results from these clones is given in Figure 5. Kvl.1,
Kvl.4 and Kv1.5, which have a histidine at this residue, show significant
sensitivity to DEPC comparable to that of GFL Ig, which is thought to be due to
SqkvlA channels (Rosenthal et al, 1996) (Figure 5A). In contrast, Kv1.2 and
ShakerB failed to exhibit a significant change in Ig amplitude after 5 minute
exposure to DEPC (Fig. 5B). In the case of ShakerB, activation kinetics
appeared to be significantly affected. Kvl.3 and Kv1.6, however, showed
DEPC sensitivity even though they also lack the equivalent of H351. The
time courses of development of the DEPC-effects on Iy amplitude and
activation kinetics observed in each of these experiments are shown in
Figures 6 and 7, respectively. In all cases, effects of DEPC were irreversible.
CONCLUSION
MULTIPLE RESIDUES MEDIATE DEPC EFFECI
The hypothesis that H351 residue of the SgKvlA channel is the only
critical position responsible for the DEPC effect was not supported by the data.
Nearly all channels exhibited a significant DEPC effect, regardless of the
presence of histidine at the external mouth of the pore. Clearly, histidine
modification by DEPC alters some critical aspect of Kvl channel function, and
the complex nature of these results strongly suggest that more than one
residue can mediate similar DEPC effects.
