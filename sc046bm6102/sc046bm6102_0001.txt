ABSTRACT
Pharmacology and site-based mutagenesis probe function of ion
channels by altering specific sites and observing changes in channel
properties. Previous studies by Spires and Begenisich (1990) showed that
external diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), a chemical modifier of histidine,
irreversibly reduces and slows potassium current (ly) in squid giant axons.
Examination of the amino acid sequence of the SqKvlA channel thought to
correspond to the axonal delayed rectifier K' channel reveals a putative
external DEPC target at histidine 351 (H351) near the pore. To examine the
role of this residue in the DEPC effect, various Kvl channels were transiently
expressed in HEK 293 cells and tested for DEPC sensitivity. It was
hypothesized that this histidine is necessary for the DEPC effect.
Although it was found that K' channels with the proposed critical
residue exhibited a reduction in peak current after DEPC application, similar
effects were seen in clones lacking the histidine near the external mouth of
the pore. These cloned channels did have other external histidines, however
Additionally, DEPC slowed the activation kinetics of nearly all tested clones,
in some cases without a corresponding decrease in current amplitude. It was
concluded that while modification of histidine residues in Kvl channels
affects functional properties, all effects cannot be attributed to modification of
the residue equivalent to H351 in squid.
