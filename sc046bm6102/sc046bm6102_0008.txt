OTHER EXTERNAL HISTIDINES MAY BE INVOLVED
It is possible that in channels with histidine in the 351 position, this
residue mediates the bulk of the DEPC effect. In SqKvlA there is only one
external histidine, making this residue the likely target. However, this is not
true of all the other +H351 Kvl’s which were tested for DEPC sensitivity (see
Figure 8 for histidine maps of tested Kvl’s), and it is possible that
modification of these alternative histidines by DEPC alters channel properties.
Kvl.3 and Kv1.6 were the two channels lacking histidine near the
mouth of the pore, which exhibited DEPC sensitivity. Examination of their
respective amino acid sequences reveals possible external DEPC targets. Kvl.3
has a histidine residue in the mouth of the pore (Gen Bank). When the
channel is in the inactivated state, this residue is exposed to the external
environment and only then accessible to modification by external cysteine¬
reagents (Liu et al 1996), and possibly also to DEPC. Pulsing puts the channel
in the inactivated state more frequently, consequently exposing the target
residue more often. Further studies on Kv1.3 should probe a possible
correlation between the DEPC effect and pulsing frequency. The Kv1.6 amino
acid sequence reveals two putative DEPC targets on the extracellular side of
the membrane (Gen Bank). DEPC modification of these histidines may alter
channel properties. Neither Kv1.2 nor Shaker B showed a significant DEPC
effect on Ig amplitude; these channels’ singular external histidine is located
on the S1-S2 loop. The apparent kinetic alteration in Shaker B should be
considered tentative until this effect has been confirmed.
