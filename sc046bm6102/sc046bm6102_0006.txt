currents were subtracted on line using a standard P/-4 technique. The
recording solutions were as follows (all concentrations in mM): 150 KGEL
internal: 20 KCl, 50 KF, 80 K-Glutamate, 10 Lysine-Hepes, 1 EGTA, 1 EDTA,
381 Glycine, 291 Sucrose, 4 Mg-ATP, 5 TMA-ÖH, pH 7.4. 20 KGFL external: 20
KCl, 480 Nacl, 20 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, 10 MgSO4, pH 7.66, plus 300 nM
tetrodotoxin to block Na“ current. 293 internal: 90 KCl, 60 KF, 1 MgCl,, 10
Hepes, 10 EGTA, 23 KÖH, pH 7.0,320 mÖOSM. 293 external: 10 KCl, 140 NaCl, 5
MgCl,, 4 CaCl,, 10 Hepes, pH 7.2. External solutions contained DEPC where
noted. Solutions were changed with a flow through system, but constant
external perfusion was not employed.
RESULTS
Effects of DEPC on GFL Neurons
DEPC was applied to GFL neurons to confirm its effect on giant axon Iy
(Begenisich and Spires 1990). 0.5 mM DEPC applied externally to GFL cells
caused a reduction in amplitude of K' current (Figure 4A). The reduction in
peak Ig following DEPC application occurred for the most part within 5
minutes and reached a non-zero steady-state (Figure 4B). Äfter washout of
DEPC, there was no recovery. In addition, external DEPC altered activation
kinetics. DEPC slowed the opening rate of the channel, as indicated by the
increased half-time to peak Iy(Figure 4C)
