to be membrane-spanning, forms the pore and selectively allows the passage
of K ions.
Pharmacological approaches combined with knowledge of molecular
structure have also revealed much about K' channel function. Mutating sites
suspected to mediate specific pharmacological effects has proven to be a
successful method. Using this approach, it has been found that scorpion toxin
binding is affected by mutation of residues at either end of the Shaker F
sequence, which implicates the external mouth of the pore as the site of toxir
binding (Mackinnon et al 1990). Site based mutagenesis and pharmacology
studies on Shaker channels have shown that position F425 (corresponding to
H351 in squid) is critical for charybdotoxin binding, and when mutated to
histidine, toxin block becomes pH-sensitive (Perez, 1996).
Chemical modification can be used as an alternative to mutagenesis, if
the modification is highly specific and irreversible. A study by Spires and
Begenisich (1990) examined the effects of histidine-specific reagents on
potassium channels in squid giant axons. It was found that external
application of 20-500 uM diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) slowed opening of
potassium channels with no effect on closing rates. Steady-state currents were
reduced in a voltage-dependent manner, but the shape of the instantaneous IÂ¬
V curve did not change with DEPC treatment. The rate of action of DEPC was
consistent with a single class of histidine residues. Internally applied DEPC
(up to 2 mM) had no effect.
