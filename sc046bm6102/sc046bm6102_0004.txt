DEPC is the mostly widely used reagent for the specific modification of
histidine (Lundblad 1994). In the pH range of 5.5 to 7.5, DEPC reacts with
histidine residues. At a moderate excess of DEPC, there is a substitution at
one of the nitrogen positions on the imidazole ring of the histidine side
group (Figure 2). Treatment with neutral hydroxylamine is used to
regenerate histidine.
The results by Spires and Begenisich suggest the presence of a histidine
residue on the extracellular surface of squid axonal potassium channels that is
important for voltage-dependent gating and conductance properties of the
channel. SqkvlA is the putative delayed rectifier K' channel in the squid
giant axon (Rosenthal et al 1996). Examination of the SqKvlA amino acid
sequence shows that the only external histidine is at position 351 (Figure 3).
As mentioned earlier, this site has been shown to be crucial for mediating
pharmacological effects in related channels.
To determine the importance of H351 in the DEPC effect, various Kvl
channels were assayed for DEPC sensitivity, taking advantage of mammalian
clones varying with respect to the presence of histidine in the equivalent
position. It was postulated that there is a correlation between the presence of
the homologous H351 and DEPC sensitivity.
