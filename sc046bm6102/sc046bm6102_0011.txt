ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 would like to thank the Gilly lab for tolerating my invasion of lab
space, not to mention my countless questions and mistakes. In particular.
thank you to Taylor Liu for getting squid and giving me tons of advice and
help. Special thanks to Mat Brock for having the patience to teach me voltage
clamping and basically everything else, from Igor Pro to tremolo. To my
advisor, Dr. Gilly, I am unbelievably grateful for the encouragement
throughout the quarter, and for the words of wisdom - " the angler must
entice, not command the reward" - l'm getting there!
FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: Schematic representation of a voltage gated K' channel. The
hydrophobic core region has six stretches of mostly hydrophobic residues (S1.
82, S3, S4, P, S6) which span the membrane. The S4 sequence is thought to be
the intrinsic voltage sensor of the channel due its unusual arrangement of
basic residues at every third position. The P sequence, which contains about
20 amino acids, has been identified as forming part of the pore region.
Figure 2: Diethylpyrocarbonate reacts with histidyl residues in to yield an N-
carbethoxy-histidyl derivative. The figure shows the modification of
histidine by DEPC.
Figure 3: The general structure of the squid K channel (SqKvlA).
Approximate locations of histidine residues are shown with open circles.
