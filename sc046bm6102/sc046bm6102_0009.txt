CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE DEPC STUDIES
There are some concerns which must be addressed before concluding
with certainty that H351 is not the only residue responsible for the DEPC
effect. It is possible that not all of the observed results were due to specific
modification of histidine residues. Rarely, DEPC can react with other
nucleophilic residues in proteins other than histidine, including sulfhydryl,
arginyl and tyrosyl, as well as o- and e-amino groups. Although it is, in
principle, possible to track these side effects spectrophotometrically, or by
resistance to reversal by hydroxylamine (Lundblad 1994), these methods do
not always provide definitive answers. Thus, the possibility that part of the
observed effects were due to non-histidine modifications must be considered.
DEPC itself is a highly sensitive molecule which is easily degraded or
modified by environmental conditions. It has been shown that DEPC should
be selective for histidine residues in proteins at pH 6 (Ovadi 1969). Studies on
pH dependence of the rate of reaction of DEPC with the imidazole ring have
calculated a pK of 6.95, indicating that only the unprotonated imidazole is
reactive (Holbrook and Ingram 1973). Also, N-carbethoxyhistidyl residues are
most stable at pH 6. All experiments in this study were performed at pH 7.2.
Therefore it is important that DEPC studies on these Kvl channels are
repeated at pH 6 to be within the calculated range of the unprotonated
imidazole.
DEPC has been studied over a wide range of concentrations, from 0.01
mM to 40 mM. Studies show that excess DEPC can undergo a second reaction
