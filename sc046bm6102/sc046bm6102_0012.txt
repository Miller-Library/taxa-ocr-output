Figure 4: The effect of DEPC on GFL neurons. Application of DEPC decreased
peak K' current over time. In (B) and (C), the bars indicate the time over
which 0.5 mM DEPC was applied. Washout of DEPC did not reverse the
decrease in current. (C) shows the effect of DEPC on channel opening rates.
There was an increase in time to half Lap or a slowing in the rate of channel
opening, and this effect was also irreversible. The apparent temporary
recovery immediately following the solution change is due to the elevated
temperature of the solution being applied which takes several minutes to be
cooled to 18°C in the recording chamber.
Figure 5: The effect of DEPC on Kvl’s, shown at different time points during
application. (A) represents channels with a histidine equivalent to H351. (B)
represents channels lacking this specific (see also Figure 8). DEPC reduced
steady-state Ig in nearly all clones. Kvl.2 and ShakerB were not nearly as
sensitive to DEPC as other channel types.
Figure 6: The effect of DEPC on amplitude of Iy in various Kvl’s over time.
DEPC reduced steady-state Ig over time in all clones except Kv1.2 and
ShakerB. In the channels which were DEPC-sensitive, there was no return to
pre-DEPC Ig levels with washout. Bar indicates presence of DEPC.
Figure 7: The effect of DEPC on activation kinetics of Kvl’s over time. In all
channels with DEPC-sensitivity described in Figure 6, as well as ShakerB,
there was a slowing of channel opening rates. Bar represents presence of
DEPC.
