described in Mathes et al (1997). Briefly, the lobes were treated with protease
(type XIV; Sigma) and mechanically dissociated onto sterile concanavilin A¬
treated 35 mm tissue culture petri dishes. Cells were kept in filter-sterilized L¬
15 medium supplemented with salts to achieve an ionic composition similar
to that of sea water (additional 263 mmol NaCl, 4.6 mmol KCl, 4.25 mmol
Cacl2, 49.5 MgCl,) at 18°C. Cells were used within one week of isolation.
Mammalian Cell Transfection
Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were transfected with
various Kvl plasmids. Cultures were maintained in high glucose DMEM
(GIBCO/BRL) with 584 mg/L L-glutamine, 10% FBS (GIBCO/BRL) and 100
U/ml pen/strep. Cells were split with trypsin, suspended and plated in 35
mm petri dishes one day prior to transfection. Cells were « 10% confluent at
the time of transfection. Transfection was performed as follows: 7.55 ul of
2M CaCl, and 1 ug DNA per plate was added dropwise to 61 ul of 2X HEPES
(consisting of 273 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na,HPO,-7H,O and 55 mM HEPES). This
solution, made up to 120 ul with dH,O, was added dropwise to the dish of
cells after transfection. The medium was changed 18-24 hours after
transfection. Most recordings were taken 2 - 4 days after transfection.
Electrophysiology
Recordings from GFL neurons and 293 cells were performed with
standard whole-cell voltage clamp procedures at 12°C and 18°C respectively.
Holding potential was -80 mV in all experiments. Non voltage-dependent
