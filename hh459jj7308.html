INTRODUCTION
Chitons and limpets represent two different classes of the phylum
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mollusca : Exact'>Mollusca;</span> yet they seem to perform very similar functions in the intertidal
community. They are slow-moving, grazing herbivores occurring together
throughout the intertidal. The similarity of their food and habitat
provoked a closer investigation of their apportionment of resources
within the sympatric areas.
In the portion of the intertidal zone of the central California
coast marked by the brown alga <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia fastigiata : Exact'>Pelvetia fastigiata</span> (J. G. Agardh) DeToni,
two common species each of chitons and limpets can be found: <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyanoplax hartwegii : Exact'>Cyanoplax
hartwegii</span> (Carpenter, 1855) and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mopalia muscosa : Exact'>Mopalia muscosa</span> (Gould, 1846), and

While <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyanoplax : Exact'>Cyanoplax</span> can be found in its greatest abundance in this area
(Ricketts and Calvin, 1968), <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. pelta,</span> <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. limatula</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mopalia : Exact'>Mopalia</span> can be
found throughout the intertidal (Test, 1945; Andrua and Legard, 1974).
Eaton (1968) and Craig (1968) distinguished the different food preferences
of Collisella limatula and C. pelta.
To identify habitat differences among these intertidal herbivores,
I conducted a general survey of their spatial distribution and of the
behavioral aspects of resource apportionment. The study was
conducted from April to June, 1974 in the high intertidal of three areas
of Monterey County, California: Mussel Point, Point Pinos and Carmel
Point. All three intertidal areas consist of granite rock outcroppings
surrounded by sand.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CYANOPLAX AND MOPALIA HABITATS
Transects were run at Mussel Point and Point Pinos through the
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pelvetia : PartialExact'>Pelvetia zone.</span> Quadrats 30 cm x 30 cm were placed along the transect
with additional quadrats extending laterally to the entire width of

e rocks touched by the transect. The number of chitons and limpets
inside each quadrat was recorded.
These transects (Figure 1) indicate that Cyanoplax is more
abundant in the areas more protected from wave shock: higher rocks.
crevices and the shoreward side of rocks. Mopalia occurs at the lower
boundary of the Pelvetia zone in regions less protected from waye
action and at a lower tidal level. The limpets are found throughout
the transects.
At Carmel Point a survey was made at the same vertical height on
the protected and open sides of the point. On the protected side of
the point, Cyanoplax can be found at densities of 5-6/m?; while on
the open-coast side of the point, only Mopalia at a density of 1-2/m
1e
can be found under-Peivetia-of a similar tidal height. The sand grain
size on the open side of the point (mdø- -.991) is much larger than
on the protected side (md?-.453) where Cyanoplax is found (Figure 2),
While relative wave motion or wave shock cannot be precisely
determined from differences in grain size (Shepard, 1963), differences
as large as those observed between the two sides of the point indicate
that large differences in wave energy must be present in these two
habitats (Krumbein, 1944-1947).

FOOD COMPETITION BETWEEN CYANOPLAX AND <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Collisella : Exact'>COLLISELLA</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Limatula : Exact'>LIMATULA</span>
Chitons in the Pelvetia zone at Mussel Point and Point Pinos
were randomly chosen; their position and the positions of the
chitons and limpets were noted and the body length of each animal
was recorded. Mapping of chiton neighbors (Figure 3) indicated
Collisella limatula to occur significantly further away (- 12.19 cm;
Student's t-test: Pf.05) from Cyanoplax than Cyanoplax was from
itself (x - 10.74 cm). C. pelta showed no such effect (X - 11.49 cm;
.2ePc. 4).
Size studies (Figure 4) demonstrated that Collisella limatula
within 20 cm of Cyanoplax were significantly smaller (X = 1.50 cm;
Pe.Ol) than C. limatula at least 50 cm away from the nearest
Cyanoplax (X = 1.80 cm).
Work by Robb (1974) has indicated that <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Cyanoplax hartwegii : PartialExact'>Cyanoplax hartwegii
found</span> under <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia : Exact'>Pelvetia</span> has a diet consisting mostly of Pelvetia and
secondly <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia occidentalis : Exact'>Hildenbrandia occidentalis</span> Setchell. <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Collisella limatula : PartialExact'>Collisella limatula
depends</span> mostly on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia : Exact'>Hildenbrandia</span> and other crustose algae for its
food (Eaton, 1968) while Collisella pelta under Pelvetia eats mostly
Pelvetia and other frondose algae (Craig, 1968). Given the common
ha
elver
occurrence of large stands of thisaga in the intertidal, Pelvetia
is probably not a limiting food, but Hildenbrandia is less abundant
by several orders of magnitude. Food competition, then, may account
for the tendency of Collisella limatula to be further away from
Cyanoplax and to be larger when Cyanoplax is not in its immediate
vicinity.

HOMESTTE CONPETITTON BETUEEN CYANOPLAX AVD COLLISELLA <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelta : Exact'>PELTA</span>
Data shown in Figure 3 was subjected to statistical analysis to
determine the degree of specific and interspecific aggregation. Clumping
around individuals of Cyanoplax is evident; Cyanoplax apparently occurs
mostly in the vicinity of other Cyanoplax (C-test - 58.3), but Collisella
limatula (G - 14.9) also show a significant tendency to aggregate near
Cyanoplax (P6.001). The difference between Cyanoplax's and C. pelta's
clumping cannot be distinguished (Arcsin transformation of percentages of
the total number of animals within 10 cm of the chiton (Box 16.10, Sokal
and Rohlf, 1969): .18 PC.2); while Cyanoplax shows significantly more
clumping with other Cyanoplax than with C. limatula (.OIC.PK.05).
Evidently there are certain locations on the rocks which are favorite
resting areas for the organisms, but within these favored areas comparative
exclusions can occur. Lyman (1975) has shown different Cyanoplax individuals
to repeatedly use the same set of home areas and these results suggest
that Cyanoplax and Collisella pelta might compete for these specific
home areas. When the number of C. pelta on a rock face also containing
Cyanoplax and C. limatula was experimentally doubled (from 6/ .1 m' to
12/ .1 m') in an area commonly used for homes by Cyanoplax, Cyanoplax
density decreased (Figure 5). Collisella limatula was not affected. When
the C. pelta were removed, the Cyanoplax returned. Observations suggested
that appropriate sites were occupied on a "first come, first served" basis.
CONNOR 6
EXCLUSION BEHAVIOR OF MOPALIA <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Muscosa : Exact'>MUSCOSA</span> TOWARDS COLLISELLA PELTA
While the density of Collisella limatula within 20 cm of Cyanoplax
was the same as its density near Mopalia (16.7/m2; see Figure 3),
Collisella pelta was much less dense in the vicinity of Mopalia (10.7/m2)
than around Cyanoplax (21.7/m2; G-test of independence: .Ol«p..025).
C. pelta within 20 cm of Mopalia were significantly smaller (Figure 4;
X = 2.39 cm; P«.05) than those at least 50 cm away from Mopalia (X - 2.75 cm).
In order to test whether Mopalia selectively excludes Collisella
pelta from its immediate area, C. pelta from a similar habitat were
placed one cm from the girdle of a submerged Mopalia. A control
C. pelta was placed on a matched substrate about 20 cm from the Mopalia.
After one hour the distance of the C. pelta from its starting position
was measured. In the ten trials run (Figure 6), the C. pelta near the
Mopalia always moved further (Mann-Whitney U-test: X - 9.8 cm;Pe.001)
than the controls (X - 3.0 cm). Contact did not seem to be a prerequisite
for moving, but in half the cases the chiton was seen to actively push
the limpet away with its girdle. This behavior was also twice observed
naturally in the field. C. pelta was the only animal observed to be
actively excluded by Mopalia. When Cyanoplax and Collisella limatula
were placed next to Mopalia, no reaction occurred.
Feeding studies of Mopalia muscosa (Barnawell, 1954; Boolootian,
1964; Smith, 1974) show that Pelvetia is not a source of food for
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>M. muscosa.</span> Mopalia must rely on less abundant stands of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina papillata : Exact'>Gigartina

MOVEMENT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE LIMPETS AND CHITONS
In the Mussel Point area, I selected a rocky outcropping covered with
Pelvetia, under which Cyanoplax hartwegii, Mopalia muscosa, Collisella pelta
and Collisella limatula were found. Movement of these animals was observed for
two 24-hour periods, one 48-hour period and one 60-hour period, The moyement
of thirteen Cyanoplax was plotted every hour during the 48-hour and the 60-hour
watches. The movement of eleven C. pelta was plotted over a 36-hour period, and
the movement of five C. limatula was plotted over a 60-hour period. Positions
of all animals were checked every hour (Figure 7).
Field observations of Cyanoplax movement (Lyman, 1974) and Collisella
pelta (using scoring method of Lyman, 1974) movement showed the two species
to be quite similar. Both moved more at night, and more when either awash or
exposed than when submerged (C. pelta average movement- night, 1.2 cy; day,
.3 cy; Pe.001: exposed, 1.1 cw; submerged, .5 cy; Pc.01). Collisella limatula,

on the other hand, moved more when submerged or awash (x - 1.8 cp) than when
dry (x - .3 cy; Pc.001), but moved equally during the night and day (.5cPf.75).
Eaton (1968) has also observed greater submerged movement in C. limatula,
and Smith (1974) observed Mopalia muscosa to move mostly at night when submerged.
While Cyanoplax, Collisella limatula and Collisella pelta all show some
degree of specific homing (Lyman, 1974; Eaton, 1968; and Craig, 1968), Cyanoplax
is the most nomadic of the three species. To quantify this movement, plots
were made of the distance of each animal from its starting point after 24 hours
(Figure 8). The traveling distance of Cyanoplax (X = 13.4 cm) was much greater
than that of either C. pelta (X - 3.8 cm; Mann-Whitney U-test: Pc.001) or
C. limatula (X = 4.3 cm; Pæ.001). No difference could be distinguished between
C. pelta and C. limatula (.4eP.5), which move more erratically within the
same general area. Average movement of the animals during the entire study
was Cyanoplax - 1.3 cm/hr, C. limatula - 1.1 cm/hr, C. pelta - .8 cm/hr; a
difference insufficient to totally cause the above results.

DISCUSSION
Hutchinson (1957) has proposed that two sympatric species will
coexist only if each
exploits some aspect of the common environment
in a different way. If limiting, the environment must be partitioned
in terms of food preference, food procurement and the requisite
microhabitats necessary to tolerate physical and biological stresses.
The evidence presented here combined with other findings can be
used to demonstrate that these four intertidal herbivores partition
their environment by food preference, spatial restriction, and temporal
restriction. This evidence is summarized in Table I. In instances of
potential resource competition, mitigating factors separate the niches.
For example, Mopalia and <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Collisella pelta : PartialExact'>Collisella pelta may</span> be potentlal food
competitors; but their activity varies with submergence, and Mopalia's
aggressive behavior forces C. pelta to occupy different areas. Cyanoplax's
nomadic behavior, as opposed to the home area behavior of the limpets,
spatially limits its disturbance of the food niche of Collisella
limatula, and distinguishes it from C. pelta which retains individual
home areas for longer periods of time than Cyanoplax.
The results of this survey therefore seem to support the generally
accepted ecological principle that congeneric species (Paine, 1962;
Kohn, 1959; Bowers, 1964; Jeffries, 1966; Haven, 1971) and confamilial
species (Magnum, 1964; Croker,1967) will show definite niche separation
despite apparent similarities in habitat and behavior.

SUMMARY
Niche partitioning by the chitons Cyanoplax hartwegii and
Mopalia muscosa, and the limpets Collisella limatula and Collisella
pelta, two classes of molluscs with similar functions in the intertidal
community, under the brown alga Pelvetia fastigiata was studied. Cyanoplax
and Mopalia were found to partition a common habitat by different
microhabitat preferences and behavioral patterns. Food niche overlap
with C. pelta was lessened by Mopalia's aggressive behavior. Food
niche overlap with C. limatula and resting area overlap with C. pelta
were lessened by Cyanoplax's nomadic behavior.
