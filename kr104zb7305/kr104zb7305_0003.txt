These fish have a gestation peried of appeximately five te
six months (Eurgess and Axelrod 1984), ending in the
springtime. Live-bearing is an evolutionary adaptation to
reduce early direct mertalitys thausands less eggs are
fertilized yearly.
Behavioral and dietary studies have been conducted in on
tuo congeneric species, Ex jacksomi and E. lateralis. Hixen
(1980) ebserved competitive interactions between the twe
species in Santa Barbara and found the striped surfperch to
be the dominant competiter aver the shallew algas-covered
reef, leaving the black surfperch te forage aver deeper turf.
Similar studies at Hepkins Marine Station hy Tom (1988)
reported that the black and striped surfperch there share
their available prey rescurces and de not differ
significantly in distributien.
Observations made by Nichels (1979) of the surfperch in
a 20 square meter transect in the same area as my study
reported sharpnese and shiner surfperch, beth found in
schools, to be the most abundant Embictocids, follewed by
pile, black striped, and calico surfperch. A personal
communigation by C. Baster reported large schoels of shiner
surfperch from 1974 to 1988 and an abundance of dvarf
surfperch from 1985 tc 1987.
