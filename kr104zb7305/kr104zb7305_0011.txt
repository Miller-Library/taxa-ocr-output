correlation is not statistically significant in the channel,
the data suggests a trend that I believe would be supported
by more ebservations.
DISCUSSION
The great variatign in densities of different species in
varicus habitsts displays the existence of niche diversity
among the five co-occurring Embictocidae species in the
st√ºdy. The protected nearshore zone contains a dynamic
population of surfperch, the patterns and distributions of
which are not always ebvious from casual observatign.
The black surfperch showed a clear abundance in the
prttected area beneath the railroad tracks during low tide.
They seemite be less successful in rough, exposed areas.
Eventheugh I have been SCUEO diving and srerkeling in all
areas of immediate prowimity to the railroad tracks, Iam
baffled by the question of these black surfperch's habitat
during high tide. I think that more distribution studies of
the greater surrounding area would be revealing.
Eoth the striped and the pile surfperch appeared to be
mest successful in the mest esposed habitats altheugh these
tue species, more than any ather, were relatively everly
distributed threugheut the study area. The strong
correlation of these fish seems interesting not only because
that trend has not been reported in other areas or at Foint
Cabrille before, but alse because these two species have
