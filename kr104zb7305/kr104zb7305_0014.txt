the same regich (Nichols 1979). Whereas the density af black
surfperch seems to have remained constant, the densities of
striped and pile surfperch have increased substantially while
remaining generally consistent with each other. Neither the
rainbow nor the schools of reef surfperch were observed in
the transect in 1979: it seems that large schools of shiner
and sharpnose surfperch were'seen instead. This data
cerrelates with the Baxter observations of schools of shiner
perch in the study area over the last fifteen years, while
this year it seems that few individuals remain. Nichels alse
reported scheols of sharpnose surfperch and some appearance
of calice surfperch, neither of which species seem to exist
aff of Feint Cabrillo this spring. It is interesting that
the shiner and sharpnose perch bear size, shape, and some
dietary similarities to the reef surfperch and
Correspondingly, the rainbew and calico perch share size and
pattern characteristics.
Nichols' data showed ancther interesting decadal
variation that at the same time of year in 1979, larger
densities of black and pile juveniles were observed than
striped juveniles. (Nichols 1979) This comparisch is
contradictory to my observations of large numbers of striped
juveniles in 1987. (See figure 9)
Eecause the number of pregnant striped decreased and the
number of ycung-of-the-year striped increased as my study
progressed, I believe that I witnessed a critical peint: the
end of E. lateralis' five- to six-menth gestation period.
The lack af literature reporting any conclusive dates of the
