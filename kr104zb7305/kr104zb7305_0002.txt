AESTRACT
Io examine what factors influence surfperch distribution
and behavier, I made cbservations of a protected nearshore
area off Foint Cabrille, California at different times of the
day and tidal cycle. Within the study area, there was
substantial niche diversity in the members of the family
The
Embictecidae ameng different habitats of similar depths.
black surfperch were found in the most pretected area of the
study and in highest densities at low tide. The striped and
pile surfperch were equal in abundance in all habitats. The
rainbow surfperch were seen in small schoels on sandy
bottoms. The reef surfperch were the mest abundant species
of Embictocid: they inhabited a shallew nearshere region and
concentrated in large schools at the entrances to channels
during low tides.
Niche diversification seems to be a relevant way of
viewing dynamic fish distributions and an important factor to
be considered in choosing methods for conducting pepulation
studies.
INTRODUCTIOM
Embictocidae (surfperch) is a viviparcus fish family
found only in the North Facific and fairly abundantly in
Menterey Bay. A diverse population occurs in the protected
nearshore area of Feint Cabrille. As with other viviparcus
animals, the young are nurtured internally by their mather.
