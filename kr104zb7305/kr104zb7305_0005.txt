Habitat C (530 square meters) is the relatively
unprotected area between Seal and Bird Rocks. Surge and
suell increase fairly dramatically as one moves inte this
habitat; waves are often breaking just seuth of Eird Rocks.
The depth here is 10 to is feets it contains the sparse edges
of the kelp forest and some Ehyllespadix covered rocks. I
spent 10 minutes observing this area.
Habitat D4(730 square meters), the ares protected by
Eird Rocks, is marked en its southern beundary by Fete's
Rock. It is a shallow area of approwimately 5 feet in depth
with parts being too shallou to sporkel at low tide. The
bottom of the southern side is light-colored and sandy, while
Ehyllespadig grous thickly in the northern section. Although
this habitat is protected from breaking waves, the water
currents can be very strong as the water moves through the
channel in one direction to the seuth. Observation time here
ranged from 10 to 15 minutes.
Habitat E (570 square meters) is the channel beyend Bird
Rocks that leads into a more exposed section af Monterey Bay.
Ehyllespadik'is heavy, but as the area sicpes down to its
maximum depth of 15 feet, the surfgrass divides to line the
edges of the sandy channel. The channel cpens up onte sone
scattered Macrscystis plants which mark the end of my stud,
area. This is the mest vielent water of my study: water
rushes between the rocks at high speeds, the surge and swell
are very large, and waves are often breaking at the mouth of
the channel. There is a small, more shallow and protected
