distribution and behavier of the Embictocidae in a 3800
square meter section of the protected nearshore zone at Faint
Cabrille, California (see figure 1). I used sporkeling and
cccasicnally SCUBe diving gear and recorded my counts and
observations on underwater paper. Observations were
conducted at different times during the day and tidal cycie.
The study area was divided into five separate habitats: the
time spent in each was recorded and vemained fairly constant
for each respective area. A str√ºctured pattern was follewed
on each snorkel survey in order to aveid as much repetitive
counting oft individuals as possible.
Habitat A (370 square meters), the area under and arcund
the railroad tracks, is very well-protected from surge and
breaking waves by Seal Rocks. Ehyilospadix covers the
shallow intertidal area of the tracksi algae grows all over
the submerged tracks and ties which are approximately one
foot above the sandy bottom. The area slepes down to a depth
of 10-15 feet, where the tracks end and a small grove of
Macregystis begins. I usually spent 15 minutes here.
Habitat B (1600 square meters), the area protected by
Seal Rocks, is marked on its southern boundary by a sand
channel. The bottom is characterized by medium-sized and
large rocks, thick Ehyllospadix, and sandy patches. Other
than the sandy, shallow area near the shore, the approximate
depth of this habitat ranges from 4 to 8 feet. Surge is
greater in this area than at the railread tracks, but rarely
strong. This is a popular swimming area for harber seals.
My cbservation time here was abcut 30 minutes.
