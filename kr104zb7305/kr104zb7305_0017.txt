presences when I was SCUBe diving and cculd lie en the bettem
relatively meticnless, surfperch came within centimeters of
me, Gnother concern is the effect of the harbor seals on the
number of fish that I saw. In the area in front of Seal
Rocks, seals regularly follewed me, surrounded ne, and
generally demanded my attention as I attempted to observe and
count Embictocids. Mest fish did not seem too dist√ºrbed and
I continually found high pumbers of fish in this habitat.
Tuc other hinderances of my Vision were the often poor
visibility in the water and the excessive presence'af
phyllespadis, meither of which varied significantly.
