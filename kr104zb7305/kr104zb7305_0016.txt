c
tuo species' segregation by depth in Santa Earbara,
California. There, Ex lateralis dominates the shallow, more
desirable reef, pushing Ex iscksoni inte deeper water. From
recent studies at Hepkins by Tom (1788), the black and
striped surfperch off of Foint Cabrille shared an identical
fesding niche and did not differ significantly in
distribution. My cbservations revealed that the two species
were significantly differently distributed aver a lateral
area of similar depths. Combining the gut analysis from Tom
(1988) and my results, these twe fish are eating similarly in
different places: factors other than food preference are
determining their habitat cheice.
The differing results that Tom (1988) and I found could
indicate the differences in cur methods of cbservation and
perspectives on cur respective transects. Her observatiomal
esperiment was done by cbserving a quadrat of one continuous
habitat. This comparison demonstrates clearly that the
cheice of transect and method of analyzing it dees affect the
results of a transect experiment. The niche diversity th√•t I
cbserved, specifically among the black and striped surfperch,
displays that different potential transects which, from
initial observations, lock very similar, in fact have very
different surfperch populations.
One inevitable concern of observational studies is the
cloudiness that surrounds the effect of the observer on the
behavier of the subjects. I can only hope that I scared all
species away in equal proportions so that my ratios have
remained consistent. The fish did not seem daunted by my
