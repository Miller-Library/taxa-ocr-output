beginnings and ends of the different species' gestation
perieds made my theery difficult te cenfirm. Nichols
observations as they relate to my data suggest that gestation
does not occur at precisely regular intervals each year, but
rather may be dependent on weather, temperature, er ether
seasonal variables. Consecutive annual spring ebservations
could yield a clearer picture of variability of gestation
periods.
Intuitively, it seems that in order to bensfit from
their avelutjomal adaptation of viviparity and to pretect
their small yearly batch of fertilized eggs, the pregnant
female surfperch weuld be required te change their behavicr
during the conclusion of their gestaticn period. The ventral
sides of the pregnant surfperch I chserved were ehvieusly
distended and lighter in coler than the rest of their bedy:
at this hlcated period they were inevitably less hydrodynamig
than usdal, Therefore, it seems appropriate that the
pregnant striped surfperch eccured mest densely in the most
protected habitat in my study: the railroad tracks. The
comparitively high numbers of injured pregnant Exlateralis
suggests either that these pregnant perch cannot swim as well
as their lithe geunterparts, that the bleated fish are more
attractive to their predators, er both of these hypotheses.
One suprising result was the different distributions of
the twe congeners, E. iacksoni and E. lateralis, in
different habitats with approkimately the same depth.
According to Hixen (1980), competition is the cause of these
