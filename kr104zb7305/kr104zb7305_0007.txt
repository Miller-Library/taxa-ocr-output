substantial. As the habitats became rougher and less
protected, their respective densities seemed to decrease.
An interesting and statistically significant correlation
was discovered between the number of black surfperch under
the railroad tracks and the height of the tide. (See figure
5) Os the tide rises, the number of Ex iacksani beneath the
tracks decreases.
I usually found these fish concentrated in tight groups
of abeut 15 under each of the algae covered railread ties and
maintaining a pacing behavior back and forth to either side
of the ties. Alang with the relatively calm water in this
habitat, the tracks seemed to afford these perch a protected
area and a large, open, horizontal plame of water to inhabit.
They were all adults (20 to 30 cm in length): I once saw a
large black chase a smaller black from beneath a railroad
tie. I recognized four pregnant females and one juvenile.1
witnessed black surfperch feeding both by picking and
winnewing. On seven sightings threughout the study I
cbserved Ex iacksoni moving in odd manners: quivering and
flipping to one side seemingly scratching their dorsal fins.
Interestingly, I sau higher numbers of black surfperch
than usual in the ares protected by seal recks during my two
nicht snorkels. They seamed less active nocturnally than any
other species.
