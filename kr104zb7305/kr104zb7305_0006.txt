cbserved in this channel for approwimately 10 minutes.
RESULTS
Threugheut the entire study, I saw a total of li species
of Embictocids (see table 1), five of which were abundant
encugh for me to hypothesize about their distribution. These
five species (the black, striped, pile, rainbow, and reef
surfperches) and their average densities in the entire study
area are presented in figure 2.
The average densities of each species in each habitat
are shoun in figure 3. The large variations display that the
five diverse habitats contain very different distributions af
surfperch, indicating considerable niche diversity among the
Embictocids of this region. The graph of percent abundance
(figure 4) shows the habitat(s) in which each species seems
mest successful er brefers to live.
The results are presented separately for each of the
major species. Tables a through 7 list the complete data
from each habitat.
Rlack Surfperch (Embigtsga jagksoni)
Altheuch the black surfperch were the fourth mest dense
in the entire study area, they had by far the greatest
density of any fish in any habitat when found beneath the
railread tracks. Likewise, the protected area under the
tracks was the enly habitat in which their density was
