Figure i - Hap of the protected nearshore zone off of Foint
Cabrille which constituted the study area. Habitat
boundaries are shewn.
Figure 2 - Graph of the average density of the five primary
Embictecid species found in the entire study area.
Density measured in fish per 10 square meters.
Figure 3 - Graph of the average density of each of the five
surfperch in each respective habitat. Density measured
in fish per 10 square meters.
Figure 4 - Fercent abundance measured solely by number of
fish observed in each habitat. Neither the size of the
habitats nor the differing total pepulations of the
species is taken inte acceunt.
S Correlation between the number of black zurfperch
Figure
cbserved under the railroad tracks and the height of
the tide. The line of regression was calculated and
drawn. Regression statistics presented in Table 8.
Figure 4 - Corrolation between the number of reef surfperch
observed in the area protected by Seal Rocks and the
height of the tide. The line of regression was
calculated and drawn. Regression statistics presented
in Table 8.
figure 7 - Statistically unsignificant correlation between
the number of reef surfperch observed in the channel
beyond Eird Rocks and the height of the tide.
Figure 8 - The density change of the surfperch or
Hepkins
Marine Life Reserve from 1979 to 1789. The 1979
densities are from Nichols (1979).
Figure 9 - The density change of the juvenile surfperch of
three speciez of zurfperch on Hepkins Marine Life
The 1977
Refuge from spring 1979 to spring 1989.
densities are from Nichals (1979).
