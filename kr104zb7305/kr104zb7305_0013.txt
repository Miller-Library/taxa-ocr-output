are the seasonal and yearly patterns of their population
structures to there de they relccate; scheols of which, if
any, species will replace them?, De emmigration and
immigration play a large rele in structuring these
pepulatiens or are they dependent on the dynamies from
reproductive recruitment? The unique life cycle of the
Embietocids, which includes the viviparous production of
advanced juveniles, makes their population dynamics an
interesting comparison to that of other resident species.
Observations or habitat manipulations could be conducted in
order to determine what factors dictate these yearly
variations of high magnitudes.
The results concerning the reef and the black surfperch
display that the tidal height is a significant variable
affecting at least two of the surfperch populations in my
study area. I found ne conclusive distributicnal effect af
the time of the day, but because of my low numbers of nightÂ¬
time cbservations, still believe that the ammeunt of light
cculd have and effect on surfperch distribution.

with these recorded in 1979 in another study of a transect in
