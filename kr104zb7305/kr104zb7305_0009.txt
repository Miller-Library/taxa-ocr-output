period I began to natice many striped perch that seemed very
light in coler or bleached out.. I once noted a harbor seal
chasing an E. lateralis.
Eile Surfperch (Damalichthys vacca)
The pile and the striped surfperch were consistently
similar in density and abundance throughout the study area.
Like the striped, pile surfperch were found to be most dense
in the twe mest exposed habitats: between Bird and Seal
Rocks and the channel beyond Bird Rocks. Next, they were
observed in almost identical density as E. lateralis in the
area protected by Seal Rocks. I observed less pile than
striped in the railroad tracks habitat and a different
behavior: the pile were seen mainly as individuals swimming
around the railroad track area as opposed to beneath the
tracks.
The pile surfperch were the most dense fish seen in the
habitat protected by Bird Rocks, the area which contained by
far the lowest numbers of surfperch. D. Vacca, as well as E.
lateralis, seemed to thrive primarily in the rough, exposed
areas but.able te live successfully throughout the study
area.
The pile surfperch often swam in small groupsiof five to
fifteen. I cbserved four juvenile and tuc pregnant pile
surfperch.
