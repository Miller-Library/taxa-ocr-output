The rainbew surfperch were the lesst dense of the five
primary Embictocids in the study area. They wereichserved in
greatest density in the exposed habitat between Eird and Seal
Recks in scheols of 10 to 20 on the sandy botton. The same
behavior was observed in the area arcund the railroad tracks
and en the scuth edge of the Seal Rocks habitat gnithe border
of the sand channel. I often observed rainbow surfperch
feeding by picking at the algal turf of the sandy ocean
floor. H. Carvi were rarely seen cutside of their schools as
individuals. I chserved two noticably pregnant rainbew
surfperch.
Reef Sunfperch (Micrometrus aurera)
The most dense Embictocid in the entire study ares was
seen primarily in the area protected by Seal Rocks. A
statistically significant correlation was found between the
number of reef surfperch in this habitat and the height of
the tide: the lower the tide, the greater the number of fish
inhabiting this area. (See figure 6) During leu tides, the
reef surfperch were observed in large scheols of 50 to 100 in
the shallew, sandy, nearshore section. Saveral times I
noticed the presence of these schools while standing on the
rocks nest to the water at lew tide.
The ather fairly abundant appearance the reef surfperch
made was in the channel beyend Bird Rocks. Here, they
appeared in the more protected section of the channel. In
this habitat as well in frent of Seal Rocks they seemed to be
more abundant at low tides. (See figure 7) Altheugh the
