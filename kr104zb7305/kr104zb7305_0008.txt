the striped surfperch,, were consistently dense in each
habitat and correlated closely in their density and abundance
te that of the pile surfperch. They were mest dense in the
channel beyand Bird Rocks follewed by the ares between Bird
and Seal Rocks: the twe most expesed habitats in the study.
Interestingly, 507 and 457 of the Ex lateralis found in those
respective regions were juveriles.
This species' nest mest dense habitat was beneath the
railroad tracks with their congeneric species, the black
perch. The bighest density, of pregnant fish were the striped
surfperch cbserved ih this areat 457 of them were visibly
pregnant. Because of an injury which marked her, one
pregnant striped surfperch was seen swimming under the same
railroad tie on four separate shorkels which spanned three
consecutive days.
A påttern that seemed to emerge but did not vield
statistically significant evidence was that as my study
period passed, the number of pregnant striped decreased and
the number of juvenile striped increased. I saw very feu
pregnant or young-of-the-year fish of other species in
comparison to the numbers I saw of E. lateralis. I seem to
have witnessed the end of the striped sürfperch's five- to
six-menth gestation pericd.
I cheerved on at least seven occassions a pregnant
striped surfperch with an injury such as a bloody gash in its
musculature. The juveniles often traveled in schools of
approximately 10. I witnessed striped surfperch feeding both
by picking and winnewing. Oddly, near the end ofmy study
