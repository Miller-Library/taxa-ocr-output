significantly different diets. While the striped surfperch
feed from the algal turf, the pile surfperch appear to be
selective visual feeders on larger spails and hermit crabs.
(Nichols 1979) This separation apparently permits them to
expleit their respective rescurces witheut competition.
The rainbou surfperch, though nat as abundant as the
ether four species, ware consistently found in small schools
on sandy bottoms in depths of ten or more feet. Although
they did not tecur in the exposed channeli past Eird Rocks
which dees have a sandy bottom, they appeared to be
successful in the rough but less-exposed area between Bird
and Seal Rocks. Ferhaps the rainbow surfperch can live
successfully in schools en any sandy bettom se leng as the
surge or reugh water is under some critical point.
The mest dynamic pepulation af Embistecids was the reaf
surfperch: depending on the height of the tide, their
numbers ranged from zero to 250. Figure Ã© suggests that
there could exist same critical tidal level such as 1.5 feet
under which the large schools of reef are always in the Seal
Rocks habitat. As with the black perch, I have anly
speculative insight inte the high-tide habitat of the
Migrometrus auroras they could be broadly spread through the
complen rocky shallow water habitat.
Accerding te the personal. observations of Chuck. Baxter,
large schools of dwarf surfperch (Micrometrus mininus,
congener of the reef surfperch) inhabited the nearshore zone
off of Feint Cabrille from 1985 to 1987. He also reported
similar large schools of shiner surfperch, related in size
