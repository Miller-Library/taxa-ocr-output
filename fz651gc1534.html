in A. perconvexu
NTRODUCTION
It has been theorized that the terrestrial isopod crustaceans of
the suborder <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Oniscoidea : Exact'>Oniscoidea</span> represent forms which have migrated from the
ocean and have thus acquired terrestrial habitats (Miller, 1938).
They may represent a transitional stage in the evolutionary movement
of fauna from the sea onto the land.
There is considerable variance between the different Oniscoidean
species and the degree of their adaptation to the land environment.
One species, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Alloniscus perconvexus : Exact'>Alloniscus perconvexus,</span> occupies the upper littoral
zones of the sandy beach, above the high tide level (Ricketts and
Calvin, 1968). It is generally burrowed in the sand at a depth of 7
to 12 cm (Brusca, 1966). Its distribution on the beach is limited
below by the high tide level and above by the degree of moisture in
the sand (Hainsworth, 1972). Water relations are of the greatest
importance in determining the local distribution of isopods on land
(Miller, 1938). <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. perconvexus</span> is not adapted to complete submergence
and will drown in seawater (Ricketts and Calvin, 1968).
A. perconvexus respires primarily through its gill surfaces,
though some special air chambers have been noted at the edges of the
exopodites which may function as accessory respiratory organs (Miller,
1938). The gill surfaces must be kept moist if they are to function
effectively. A. perconvexus consequently requires a habitat of
greater moisture content than <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porcellio scaber : Exact'>Porcellio scaber</span> and other terrestrial
Oniscoideans. This shows a lesser degree of adaptation to the land

environment.
Observations of the activity of A. perconvexus by this author
have suggested that it leaves its daytime burrows at night to actively
move about on the sand surface. The animal is thus behaviorally
protected from the desiccating influences of the lower daytime
humidities by remaining in burrows during the daylight hours.
The determinant factors for the activity of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. perconvexus may</span>
be either exogenous or endogenous. The stimulus for activity could
be an environmental cue or may be related to the internal physiology
of the animal. Studies on the terrestrial isopod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Oniscus asellus : Exact'>Oniscus asellus</span>
have shown that its endogenous diurnal activity patterns are correlated
with the alternating light-dark cycle, and not with fluctuations in
temperature and humidity (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1961). The light-dark
cycle is a more regular cycle for an organism to be synchronized with.
An endogenous rhythm would be a useful adaptation for an isopod which
might have no other means to obtain information about external
conditions which might themselves be acting as stimuli for its activity
patterns (Enright, 1970). Such a mechanism would preclude activity
before conditions were favorable. This would substancially benefit
A. perconvexus.
The present experiments were conducted from April to June, 1973.
with the objective of ellucidating the major factors which determine
the activity patterns of the sand beach isopod, Alloniscus perconvexus.
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
METHODS
This investigation was based on field observations and laboratory
studies. The population of Alloniscus perconvexus studied was found
on the upper portion of the northeast facing sandy beach between Pt.
Cabrillo and Pt. Alones on Monterey Bay, California.
Field Studies
Field studies of the activity patterns of A. perconvexus were
conducted using 26 pitfall traps consisting of plastic cups (diameter
of 8 cm) buried in the sand and flush with the surface. These traps
were placed 0.5 to 1.0 m apart, and 5 cm from any rocks or deposits
of wrack. The study region was 7 m square. Traps were examined at
hourly intervals at night during April and May. Collected animals
were immediately released at least 1.5 m from any trap, and those
caught in any one trap were not all released in the same place. This
reduced the probability of catching the animals consistently in the
same trap while still keeping them in the same local area.
Initially a 24 hour observation period was conducted to establish
the overall pattern of activity in the field. This was followed by
observations during the active night periods on 3 successive evenings,
during which the environmental factors of air temperature and relative
humidity weremonitored at hourly intervals. Temperature was measured
with a tele-thermometer and humidity with a Honeywell relative humidity
indicator. Wind speed was negligible on all 3 nights and was not
recorded. A second 24 hour observation was conducted i month later
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
to ensure that no change in activity patterns occurred during the
course of the studies.
Laboratory Experiments
Laboratory experiments were conducted at the Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove, California.
Phototropism was studied by applying slight modifications to the
procedure and apparatus described by C. H. Abbott (Abbott, 1918) in
his studies of the responses of Porcellio scaber to light. The light
source consisted of an enclosed box with a slit opening and a high
intensity light bulb (connected to an American Optical voltage
selector). Water in a rectangular container was a coolant for the
light beam passing through the slit (see details in Appendix A).
In this set of experiments, a circular experimental grid was laid
out on a board covered with brown paper. This surface precludes
burrowing by the animal. The light source box was then placed on this
board and the entire apparatus was placed in a darkroom of 14°0, which
is slightly warmer than the nightly air temperature. Individuals were
tested by placing them in the center of the experimental grid and
noting where they left the grid. A positive response consisted of a
any individual leaving the circle in the quadrant which faced the
light. An individual was tested in each-of 4 orientations relative
to the direction of the light (see Appendix A). Four runs were made.
The first run used 9 individuals collected at 0100 and tested after
a period of acclimation to the experimental conditions. The second
run used animals collected at 1600 and tested at that time. The
leterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
third run used animals collected the previous day at 1400, acclimated
for 24 hours, and tested at 1400. The final run used the animals of
the previous test, only they were tested 12 hours later at 0200.
Controls consisted of similar runs conducted with no light source.
A second set of phototropism experiments was conducted using a
sand surface which allowed the animals to burrow normally. A bottom-
less box 37x7.5x10 cm, open at both ends, was placed into a tub
containing sand from the natural habitat. This comprised the experi¬
mental chamber. The sides were imbedded 3 cm into the sand. One half
of the chamber had been darkened inside by black paper, and another
sheet of black paper was placed over that open end. The other end was
oriented towards a dim light of 0.14 ft candle intensity, measured by
a Photovolt light meter. A pitfall trap was placed at either end,
and 20 animals were introduced in the middle of the chamber. After
2 hours the traps were emptied, and the process was repeated for 20
more animals. These experiments were conducted at night in the 1400
darkroom.
A third set of phototropism experiments was conducted in the 14°0
darkroom to determine a possible threshold light intensity at which
the animals might leave their daytime
microhabitats. The experi¬
mental chamber consisted of a box (4OxiOx10 cm) with one half open on
top and the other half completely enclosed as a dark chamber, and
only a small 2.5x2.5 cm opening between the two halves. The same high
intensity light mentioned earlier was placed 5 cm above the end of
the open chamber. Fifteen A. perconvexus were collected at 2030,
in A. perconvexus
Determinants of Activit
shortly before their natural activity would begin, and placed into the
dark chamber for a short acclimation period. The light was turned on
and the opening between the two chambers was uncovered. The number
of animals seen in the lighted chamber was noted after 5 and 10
minute intervals, and the procedure was repeated at decreasing light
intensities. The experiment was repeated the next evening with
different animals.
Experiments to study the effects of relative humidity on the
burrowing response of A. perconvexus were conducted in covered humidity
chambers consisting of glass dishes containing 2.5 cm of sand. Small
crucibles containing distilled water and calcium chloride desiccant
were used to produce relative humidities of 100% and 50% respectively,
The chambers were placed in the 14°0 darkroom. Ten animals, collected
at night, were placed in each chamber after a short acclimation period.
The covered chambers were examined after 30 and 60 minute intervals
to determine the number of burrowed isopods.
Studies to detail activity patterns were conducted on a laboratory
population of 50 individuals established in constant darkness under
constant conditions. The population was maintained in an open plastic
tub measuring 30x17x10 cm and containing 5 cm of sand. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phyllospadix : Exact'>Phyllospadix</span>
wrack was used as a food source, and was replaced periodically as it
dried out. Small amounts of water were added as needed when the sand
became dry.
The isopods for the laboratory population were collected from
beneath rocks on the beach on the afternoon of May 7, and were placed
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
into the constant darkness conditions at this time. Observation of
activity patterns began on May 9, the criterion for activity again
being presence on the sand surface. Activity was measured by visual
counting with a flashlight masked with several layers of red cellophane.
The observation period lasted a maximum of 15 seconds, and was repeated
at intervals of i to 2 hours throughout the active period. These
observations were continued for a 3 week period, and totalled i1 obser-
vation periods.
A second population of 50 A. perconvexus was established in
laboratory conditions identical to those of the previous population.
This population was maintained undisturbed in constant darkness for
a period of 6 days. After 6 days the population was placed on a
reversed light-dark cycle for a period of 7 days. Illumination was
provided by a standard 60 W light bulb which was turned on at 2000
and off at 0800, this representing an approximate 12 hour shift in
the light-dark cycle. The light was turned off at 0800 on May 31
after 7 days, and the population was kept in constant darkness for
the duration of the research period. Activity levels were monitored
by the same means used in the previous experiment.
A control experiment to evaluate the degree of disturbance due
both
to the flashlight was conducted concurrently with of the previous
experiments. Five individuals were collected at night and placed
in separate glass containers, each containing 2.5 cm of sand and some
Phyllospadix wrack. These dishes were placed under conditions of
constant darkness and were undisturbed by flashlight for a 6 day
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
period. The individuals were then observed periodically at intervals
of 3 or 4 hours for one day to check activity levels at different
times.
A second control experiment was conducted to check the possi¬
bility of light leaks in the darkened chambers containing the 2
laboratory populations. Strips of Kodac photography paper were
introduced into the chamber and removed after periods of exposure
of 1, 2, and 60 minutes. The paper was then developed to see if it
had been exposed by light.
RESULTS
The field population studied showed a clearly delimited period
of activity during the night hours (Figures 1, 2, and 3). Peak
activity generally occurred between 2200 and 0200.
Little correlation was noted between environmental factors and
the initiation of activity (Figure 3). There is no consistent
relation between fluctuations in activity and corresponding fluctua¬
tions in temperature or humidity. There is a suggestion of a
relation between activity and saturation defecit, as no activity
is seen when the saturation defecit exceeds 2.5.
A strong correlation existed between the onset of activity
and sunset, and between the cessation of activity and sunrise.
A. perconvexus shows a statistically significant (p.O1 in
a chi square test) positive phototropic response in all cases where
the experiments were conducted during night hours (Figure 4). In
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
addition, a significant photopositive response was observed during
daytime tests after the animals had been acclimated for 24 hours
in the darkroom (p.Ol in a chi square test. Animals taken from
the environment and tested immediately show a random response to
light (p=.05 in a chi square test). The controls of May 17 and 18
show no significant responses when the light was off (p.9 and
p.25 respectively in a chi square test). The second phototropism
experiment (Figure 5) also indicates a photopositive response (p
.01
in a chi square test) while the unlighted control indicates a
random response (p.25 in a chi square test).
As the wide 95% confidence intervals indicate, the sample size
in the light intensity threshold experiment was quite small
(Figure 6). Although a trend can be seen in the generally increasing
responses of the animals towards light as the intensity decreased.
no statistically significant threshold can be established for the
response. Significant differences are seen after 5 minutes between
the response at 0.02 ft. candle and 0.2 ft. candle, and after 10
minutes between the response at 0.02 ft. candle and 0.1 ft. candle.
It appeared that animals started responding positively to light at
levels below 0.1 ft. candle, though this can't be verified statis¬
tically with this sample size.
A significant correlation between relative humidity and burrowing
was clearly evident (Figure 7). The animals burrow significantly
more at 50% than at 100, as the 95% confidence intervals indicate.
The response is more pronounced after 60 minutes exposure to the
terminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
humidity level than after 30 minutes.
The population kept under constant dark conditions exhibited
no significant difference in activity pattern from the field
population, even after 3 weeks (Figure 8). The peak of activity
fell within the same general range of 2200 to 0200. Although
occasional individuals were observed to be active at times earlier
or later than those observed in the field, it was not a consistent
or common occurrence. Slight irregular changes in the amplitude of
activity were observed. A. perconvexus retained its 24 hour activity
pattern throughout the entire 3 week period.
The second laboratory population acquired a new activity
pattern, quite different from that observed in the field, during
the 7 day period of entrainment to the reversed light regime. After
the first period in constant darkness, both the overall period of
activity and the time of peak activity shifted forward 2 to 3 hours
each period on successive days until the peak activity was once
again near 2400, where it remained fixed (Figure 9). After 7 days
of entrainment to the reversed light regime, the activity pattern
of the population shifted to that associated with a normal light
regime after 4 periods in constant darkness. This pattern
corresponds to that observed both in the field and in the other
laboratory population.
DISCUSSION
The fundamental issue examined in this study is whether the
leterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
activity pattern observed in A. perconvexus is a response to
exogenous environmental cues or is due to endogenous influences.
A definite pattern of nocturnal activity is exhibited by A.
perconvexus (Figures 1, 2, and 3). This is a useful adaptation in
view of the animal's moisture requirements. The animal is less
exposed to desiccation since relative humidities are greater at
night with the lower temperatures. However there is no correlation
between activity and fluctuations in temperature and humidity
(Figure 3). A. perconvexus was never observed active when the
saturation defecit exceeded 2.5. The threat of desiccation becomes
greater as saturation defecit increases. No significant correlation
between activity and the saturation defecit was noted. As data for
day III in Figure 3 indicate, activity had generally ceased by 0600
although the saturation defecit was still a very favorable 0.10.
Temperature and humidity are unreliable cues for activity because
their daily cycles are irregular. Saturation defecit, being a
function of both temperature and humidity, might not be a reliable
stimulus either. These factors can thus be eliminated as stimuli
for the initiation and cessation of activity.
Field observations suggest that light is the stimulus to which
the animal responds. The animal was never seen active before sunset.
and only isolated individuals were detected after sunrise. Light
would be a very reliable stimulus for A. perconvexus to respond
to because of the regularity of the daily light cycle.
The nightly increases in relative humidity and decreases in
terminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
temperature and saturation defecit appear to be integrally related
to the light-dark cycle in establishing the activity pattern of
A. perconvexus. The animal profits from the nightly moisture
conditions while it also has a reliable stimulus to define its active
periods. The nature of the effect of light on A. perconvexus is
uncertain, for the animals may be responding to light directly as
an exogenous stimulus, or light may be the entraining agent for an
endogenous rhythm.
The definite photopositive response of A. perconvexus (Figures
5 and 6) is seen only in those animals which had previously been
acclimated to the 14°0 darkroom. Those tested directly from the
field exhibited a random response. Though statistically insignifi-
cant, there was an apparent trend towards an increased positive
response to light at lower light levels (Figure 6). These responses
could indicate that A. perconvexus is responding to low light levels
as a stimulus for its emergence at night. This could, however, be
a response to some cue besides light.
The relative humidity in the darkroom where the experiments
were conducted was 60%, with a saturation defecit of 4.8. This
defecit is considerably higher than the maximum level of 2.5 seen
during field activity. Cloudsley-Thompson (Cloudsley-Thompson,
1958) found that Porcellio scaber becomes photopositive when in
danger of desiccation. This response allows them to relieve the
moisture stress by moving towards a more favorable habitat. A.
perconvexus could conceivably be exhibiting the same behavior in
leterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
the dry 14°0 darkroom.
A relative humidity of 50% was sufficient stimulus to induce
burrowing (Figure 7), presumably to avoid desiccation. The satura¬
tion defecit at 14°0 and 50% humidity is 6.0, which is slightly
greater than that at 60%. Animals at 14° and 60 humidity may be
facing a similar desiccation threat, and respond to the light
positively as <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. scaber</span> was seen to do. This is consistent with
the observation that several animals which had demonstrated a random
or photonegative response when first tested would exhibit a definite
photopositive response after acclimation in the darkroom.
It would be an adaptive advantage for A. perconvexus to show
a photopositive response under desiccation stress when burrowed in
the sand. To move to a more favorable microhabitat through the sand
would be a difficult process, and the animal would be exposed to
the desiccating influences for a greater period of time than it would
if it moved along the sand surface, even though it would then be
exposed to light. The animal can move more quickly along the sand
surface, and would be exposed to desiccation for a shorter period
in moving to an area of greater moisture content. This behavioral
adaptation appears to explain the nature of the observed photo-
positive responses in the laboratory.
The retention of the same 24 hour periodicity in activity in
a laboratory population of A. perconvexus as seen in the field is
not sufficient evidence for the presence of an endogenous rhythm.
though it may be suggestive of one, even after a 3 week period.
Jeterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
Some unknown factor in the environment may be effectively acting
as a stimulus to which the animals are responding. Light couldn't
be the factor because the only light received was from brief exposure
to the masked flashlight at regular intervals. As the 5 control
animals indicated, the flashlight apparently had no influence on
their activity; they followed the same 24 hour periodicity though
they were undisturbed for 6 days. The controls further indicated
that individual isopods become active independent of other isopods.
Activity isn't initiated by a single individual.
No evidence of a spontaneous frequency, or free running period
as defined by Pittendrigh (Aschoff, 1960), is seen, other than the
24 hour period observed in A. perconvexus. Seven periods of obser-
vation under constant conditions are required before spontaneous
frequency can be mentioned relative to an animal's activity pattern
(Aschoff, 1960). A. perconvexus has followed the same periodicity
in its activity for a 3 week period in constant conditions. This
periodicity is in synchrony with the 24 hour light-dark cycle.
This suggests that A. perconvexus has a spontaneous frequency of
24 hours.
After a 7 day entrainment period to a reversed light-dark
cycle, the population exhibits the expected acquired activity
pattern, which is in synchrony with the reversed light regime.
on the first day in constant darkness. The activity pattern then
gradually shifts forward each day until it becomes fixed on the
pattern already seen in the laboratory and in the field. The dark
eterminants of Activity in A. perconvexus
chamber was effectively shielded from light, as the test with the
photographic paper indicated (none had been exposed by light after
different periods in the chamber). The brief exposure to the masked
flashlight in the earlier control seemed to have no effect on the
animals. Light cannot be the stimulus for the observed change in
the activity pattern after entrainment.
The entrainment process indicated that light is a crucial
determinant of activity in A. perconvexus. No activity was observed
during the lighted periods of the reversed light cycle, although
this was the period of normal field activity. The animal was
responding to the light in the laboratory, as other conditions
remained constant. The 7 day artificial light stimulus wasn't
sufficiently powerful to permanently entrain A. perconvexus, for
once it was removed some stronger stimulus acted to shift the
activity pattern forward to again be synchronized with the normal
light-dark cycle. If this stimulus were some exogenous cue, a
sudden switch in the pattern might be expected, yet here a gradual
change was observed.
There is strong evidence for the presence of an endogenous
rhythm which determines the activity patterns of A. perconvexus.
This is a powerful rhythm and is in synchrony with the periodic
fluctuations in the light-dark cycle. It would appear that the
transitions between light and darkness are the important natural
factors which maintain this rhythm. This would explain the failure
of the artificial light stimulus to permanently entrain the animals
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
to a different light regime, for there were no simulated periods of
dusk and dawn. It may also be true that the duration of the
artificial light stimulus (7 days) was too short to permanently
entrain them. This seems unlikely, however, particularly since
the animals were in constant darkness for 6 days prior to the intro
introduction of the reversed light regime.
Endogenous factors appear to be the primary stimuli determining
the activity patterns of A. perconvexus. Light can overcome the
endogenous factors to become the primary stimulus under the
artificial conditions seen here in the laboratory. The influence
of the light is lost quickly once the animal is again in constant
darkness. The more powerful endogenous rhythm overcomes the effect
of light in determining activity, and the natural activity cycle
of the animal is restored.
Determinants of Activity in A. perconvexus
SUMMARY
1. Field studies have indicated that Alloniscus perconvexus,
the sand beach isopod, exhibits a definite pattern of nocturnal
activity, with peak activity between 2200 and 0200.
2. Laboratory studies indicated that A. perconvexus demonstrates
a positive phototropic response when threatened by desiccation.
3. Strong evidence was found for the existence of an endogenous
rhythm in A. perconvexus which is in synchrony with the natural
light-dark cycle. This rhythm seems to determine the activity
patterns of the animal. This is a powerful rhythm, for after 7
days of entrainment to a reversed light regime, the activity
pattern of a population of A. perconvexus shifted within 3 days
to that pattern associated with a normal light cycle once the
population was placed into constant darkness.
