Figure 5. Diurnal pattern of ammonia release in fed C. harfordi exposed to
continuous light and continuous dark regimes. Animals were kept in
constant conditions for 24 hours prior to the initiation of experimen-
tation. All excretion rate values obtained at specific time points with-
in a 24-hour period for a given specimen were averaged, with each value
in turn being compared against this 24-hour mean. The ratios of the exÂ¬
cretion rate to the mean value for 10 samples were then averaged and
plotted for each time interval. Standard deviations are indicated for
each sample group.
