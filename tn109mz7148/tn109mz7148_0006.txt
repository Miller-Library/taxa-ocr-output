Figure 3 illustrates the diurnal pattern of ammonia release in fed C.
harfordi. The results presented here have been tabulated by a method which
corrects for the significant release rate variances among individuals at dif-
fering life stages. All excretion rate values obtained at specific time
points within a 24-hour period for a given specimen were averaged, with each
value in turn being compared against this 24-hour mean. The ratios of the
excretion rate to the mean value for each time point are indicative of the
general daily pattern of ammonia release for a given individual. Release rates
so normalized were averaged for a group of specimens at each specific time
and plotted as shown.
A critical analysis of figure 3 indicates that within this nutritionally
homogeneous population, there does exist a detectable, non-random diurnal
variation in release rates. A statistically significant maximum excretion
period centered around 0200 can be easily identified. In turn, a minimum exÂ¬
cretion period occurs in late afternoon. These findings are in marked con-
trast to those of Kirby (1973) and others (Wieser, et. al., 1969) who have
generally found daytime maxima in other isopods. However, many of the iso-
pods examined in this respect were terrestrial herbivores, a fact which may
limit comparison with C. harfordi, a marine carnivore,
Figure 4 displays the normalized release rates for non-fed specimens of
C. harfordi over a 24-hour period. The results are significant only in the
sense that they suggest that the nutritional state of the organism affects
the pattern of ammonia release. One will note that there is a marked dampen-
ing of the normal diurnal pattern to such a degree that it is not detectable
on a statistically significant basis. A rough quantitative comparison shows
that on the average over a 24-hour period, fed C. harfordi excrete about three
times as much ammonia as do non-fed individuals. Thus, in general, the diurnal
