pattern of ammonia release in C. harfordi is a partial function of nutritional
status.
Figure 5 presents preliminary results on the effects of continuous light
and dark regimes upon normalized ammonia excretion rates over a 24-hour period,
Animals were pre-exposed to either constant light or dark for a 24-hour period
prior to the initiation of the appropriate experiment and were kept in con¬
stant conditions for the duration of the experiment. The graph indicates that
a continuous environment does not remove the previously observed diurnal pat¬
tern of ammonia excretion. This suggests that an endogenous release rhythm
is present in C. harfordi which is to a certain degree independent of environ¬
mental lighting cues. However, it does appear that constant lighting condi¬
tions do modify excretory response patterns. Both observed maxima have been
shifted towards a later time of day. This observation may support the con¬
cept that in the absence of environmental cues such as light/dark photoperiodism,
endogenous rhythms may become desychronized with time. However, more compre¬
hensive research is required in order to unequivocally demonstrate this prin¬
ciple at it applys to endogenous ammonia release patterns in C. harfordi.
Continuous dark also appears to enhance the diurnal release rhythm, and
a rough quantitative comparison indicates that dark adapted animals release
about 75 percent more ammonia over 24 hours than do normal light/dark or
light adapted organisms. Due to the great individual variations in release
rates among these relatively small sample populations, a precise quantitative
comparison cannot be made here. However, this would suggest that light is
associated with decreased ammonia release, and this may in turn be correlated
with the observation that C. harfordi are less active when exposed to light
(Harrold, 1973).
