1.0 ml ammonia sample were sequentially added 1.0 ml of a phenol-alcohol
solution, 1.0 ml of a sodium nitroprusside solution, and 2.5 ml of an oxi¬
dizing reagent containing sodium hypochlorite. The reaction mixture was al-
lowed to stand at room temperature for exactly one hour and a colorimetric
determination of ammonia content was performed on a Klett-Summerson Photo-
electric Colorimeter, model 800-3, using a red filter. Ammonia determinations
were generally done in duplicate. A standard curve was prepared using ammonium
sulfate as substrate. Control samples consisted of either deammonified water
or seawater.
Analyses available on a number of isopod species have shown ammonia to
be the predominant nitrogenous waste product (Dresel and Moyle, 1950). Because
of the extremely low production of fecal materials in C. harfordi (Johnson,
1973), and because it has been reported that the feces in other isopods con¬
tain only a small fraction of the total excreted ammonia (Dresel and Moyle,
1950), solid waste material were not specifically examined. Individual speci-
mens of C. harfordi were immersed in 4 ml of seawater, and at the specified
times, aliquot samples were taken for ammonia analysis. Fresh seawater was
then introduced into the sample tubes and the specimens were kept ambient
with respect to ocean temperatures. Oviparous females were excluded from
all experiments and individuals utilized in the experimentation were selected
at random. Dry tissue weights were determined on a Mettler balance after in-
dividual specimens were dried to constant weight. Subsequently, mean hourly
ammonia excretion rates per milligram dry tissue weight were computed at the
specified times for a given sampling interval.
