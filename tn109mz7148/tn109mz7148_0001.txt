SSTRACT
1. An inverse exponential relationship between ammonia excretion as ex-
pressed in ng NHa/mg dry body weight/hr when plotted as a function of
dry body weight (mg) has been established in Cirolana harfordi, a marine
isopod.
2. A diurnal pattern of ammonia excretion has been detected in specimens of
C. harfordi exposed to a normal light/dark photoperiod.
3. Non-fed members of a C. harfordi population exhibit a dampened pattern of
diurnal ammonia release and appear to excrete less total ammonia per unit
tissue weight over a 24-hour period than do fed individuals.
Conditions of constant light or constant dark do not remove the observed
pattern of diurnal ammonia release. Continuous light dampens the daily
excretion rhythm and appears to cause a diminution in ammonia excretion
rates observed over a 24-hour period.
