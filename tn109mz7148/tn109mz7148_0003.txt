environmental cues play a significant role in modifying excretory processes.
This research examines the diurnal pattern of ammonia release in a marine
isopod, Cirolana harfordi, by initially establishing a guideline relationship
which shapes the interpretation of the subsequent data presented and by in-
vestigating the patterns of nitrogenous waste excretion in fed and non-fed
animals, and in organisms exposed to constant environmental conditions.
TERIALS AND METHODS
Generally found under rocks within intertidal areas along the Pacific
Coast of North America, Cirolana harfordi (Lockington, 1876), was chosen for
this investigation partially because it was thought that its high levels of
protein turnover due to its carnivorous eating habits would contribute to-
wards producing more pronounced excretory rate changes with time in response
to environmental variables, and because it is amenable to laboratory manipu-
lation. Specimens of C. harfordi were collected in baited traps along the
coast of Monterey Bay adjacent to Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
California during the months of April and May, 1973. Squid wrapped in a per-
meable nylon material proved to attract adequate numbers of non-gravid in¬
dividuals. Specimens fed whole squid ad lib and a group of non-fed individuals
were kept in separate containers for approximately two weeks prior to experi-
mentation. During this time, animals were exposed to a normal light/dark
photoperiod (lights on 0600; lights off 2000). Incident light intensities
corresponded approximately to natural illumination levels.
Ammonia was determined by a modification of the phenol-hypochlorite
method as outlined by Solórzano (1969) who indicates the method to be in¬
sensitive to other nitrogenous compounds such as urea or amino acids. To a
