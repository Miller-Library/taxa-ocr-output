In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that in C. harfordi, a
non-random, carefully regulated process of ammonia release exists which ex-
hibits properties of endogenous rhythmicity. Hartenstein (1968) has suggested
that in the colonization of land, terrestrial isopods retained ammonotelism
because of the thermodynamic advantages conferred by not being required to
convert toxic ammonia wastes to more inert products. It appears that a numÂ¬
ber of terrestrial isopod species excrete ammonia by releasing it in a volatile
form. However, these isopods have been required to develop patterns of
volatile ammonia release so that release takes place during exposure to rela-
tively high humidities when concomitant body water loss is also minimized.
Wieser and Schweizer (1970) have stated that "isopods have adapted protein
metabolism to terrestrial conditions by programming the excretion of nitrogen
in such a way that it takes place mainly during periods of inactivity when
the animals are in their moist retreats." In a sense, it appears possible
that the capacity to "program" ammonia release is not necessarily a terrestrial
adaptation, but a fundamental uniform physiological characteristic of a
number of isopod species, marine included.
