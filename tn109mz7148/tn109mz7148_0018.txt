Figure 3. Diurnal pattern of ammonia release in fed C. harfordi. All ex-
cretion rate values obtained at specific time points within a 24-hour
period for a given specimen were averaged, with each value in turn
being compared against this 24-hour mean. The ratios of the excretion
rate to the mean value for 10 samples were then averaged and plotted
for each time interval. Standard deviations are indicated for each
sample group.
