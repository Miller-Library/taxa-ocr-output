Prior to the presentation of data which characterizes the diurnal rhythm
of ammonia excretion in C. harfordi, a significant relationship should be
established which has necessitated modifications in the statistical inter-
pretation of ammonia release patterns. Figure 1 illustrates log ammonia excre-
tion as a function of log dry body weight. One can note a significant negaÂ¬
tively sloping regression line which exhibits a regression coefficient of
-1.116. When a linear plot for these values is constructed as in figure 2.
a diminishing exponential curve can be fitted to express the relationship.
These data strongly suggest that young, developing C. harfordi possess a much
higher rate of protein turnover than do older, more mature organisms. These
concepts are essentially summarized in table 1. One can note excretion values
ranging from a minimum of 1.3 ng NH,/mg/hr to a maximum of 38.5 ng NH./mg/hr
in different individuals over a 24-hour period, with significant excretion
rate differences between small and large animals. In terms of absolute excre-
tion rate values, organisms less than 14 milligrams dry body weight excrete
approximately 6 to 8 times as much ammonia per unit tissue mass than do larger,
mature organisms.
This inverted exponential relationship is important in that there exist
great variations in ammonia excretion measures as expressed on weight basis
among different individuals within a normal sample population. Thus, unless
very large or carefully matched samples are utilized, internal standards are
required in order to evaluate in a meaningful manner the diurnal patterns of
ammonia excretion in groups of C. harfordi. As far as we know, this concept
has been ignored by those who have investigated ammonia excretion rates in
isopod populations.
