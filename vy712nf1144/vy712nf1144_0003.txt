separated from it. The results of these field studies are presented
in Figures I and2. Analysis of variance and standard deviation of
these samples showed a significantly non-random distribution.
Figure 3 presents the percent of total animals found as a function of
algal condition. No significant correlation was detected.
Laboratory Investigations
As 1. resecata is known to occur, in another colour variety,
on Zostera marina, a feeding choice experiment was conducted in which
twenty uniform disks,cut from a blade of Macrocystis with a cork borer,
and two uniform lengths of Zostera were placed in each of two containers
with running sea water. Twenty isopods were added to one. Twelve
hours later, all of the Macrocystis had been eaten, and none of the
Zostera as determined. Algae in the control chamber was unchanged.
A similar experiment in which twenty disks of Macrocystis and of
Nereocystis Luetkeana Postels and Ruprecht were used, gave rather unusual
results. Control algae, and experimental Macrocystis were unchanged,
but the experimental Nereocystis had all been grazed down to the inner,
colourless cortex, none of which had been eaten.
A third similar experiment was performed, using equal sized pieces
of fresh Nereocystis and Nereocystis which had been artificially
scraped to remove as much as possible of the outer layers. The
isopods removed what the experimenter had been unable to remove of
the surface layers, and grazed the fresh piece down to the cortex.
No change was observed in the control.
Another series of experiments, using the apparatus portrayed
in Figure 4, was performed. Extracts were made of Macrocystis and
