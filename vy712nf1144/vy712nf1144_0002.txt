of aggregates of one or more isopods was noted. Distribution was
found to be patchy with aggregates occurring at distances frequently
separated by several hundred yards. SCUBA techniques were employed
in actual counting with several dives made down to the bottom.
searching the lower regions of the thalli for animals. Procedures
employed in counting were as follows: when the first isopod was
observed, all visible isopods on that plant and adjoining plants were
counted and recorded on a standard underwater diving slate. Data

was grouped according to the part of the plant on which the aggregate
occurred, and the size of that aggregate. Also the state of
deterioration of the algae on which the animals occurred was noted.
Algal deterioration was classified as follows: I - no deterioration:
II - slightly grazed with little deterioration; III - well grazed with
little deterioration; IV - heavily grazed with some decomposition;
V - thorough deterioration often with blade loss.
Examination of material returned to the laboratory revealed
that animals less than two mm. in length were present but not detected
in field observations.
The isopods were never observed on any part of the plant more
than ten feet from the surface. They occur on the apical portion
from which are formed new blades, the floating stipe, and submerged
stipe to a depth of ten feet, and on the pneumatocysts. Occurrence
on mature blades was never observed during daylight hours but was
observed at night. However, it was not possible to quantify distribution
at night. These isopods show a high degree of proficiency in
swimming, and have been observed to swim towards a kelp plant when
