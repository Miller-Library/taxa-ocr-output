Substrate selection in 1. resecat.
Nereocystis by osterizing five large blades in sea water, and diluting
to 1000 ml., and then filtering three times through bolting cloth.
An isopod solution was made in a similar fashion, using 100 1. resecata.
The animals in aquaria readily attached to rubber tubing when their usual
substratum was absent. The rubber tubing was clamped in the center
to prevent mixing of the solutions, and holes made in the tubing with
a dissecting probe to allow the fluid to leak out. The apparatus was
flushed out with sea water between runs. The behaviour of ten isopods
placed into the center of the chamber was observed. At one minute intervals
five minutes, the location of the isopods on the tubing was recorded.
Values for each run were averaged, and the nine resultant pairs of
data were subjected to the Wilcoxon rank sum test (Snedecor, 1967).
A data pair was composed of the number of isopods on the control side
and the number on the side receiving the experimental fluid.
Discussion
North (1971) indicates that punctures from the feet of these
animals, and areas of grazing may become centers of growth of
bryozoa (especially Membranipora membranacea Linnaeus) and other
epiphytes, which may in turn lead to bacterial or fungal infections,
and especially, black rot. Black rot is a disease or condition
cound among the Phaeophyta following prolonged exposure to warm
summer temperatures. In fact, the isopods are usually present in
much diminished numbers at that time of year, although they may be
the originators of the chain of events.
The site which the authour observed to harbour the greatest
numbers of isopods, the juncture between the pneumatocyst and the
