Substrate Selection in 1. resecate
Introduction
Idothea resecata, an isopod occurring in two substrate matching
colour variations, inhabits Macrocystis kelp beds and Zostera. This animal
was the subject of some initial investigations by Jones (1971).
He and Limbaugh (1955) constitute the primary contributors to a meager
supply of information about this crustacean. The focus of Limbaugh's
work was on predation of 1. resecata in California kelp beds by a
number of fish: Paralabrax clathratus, Oxyjulius californica,
Heterostichys rostratus, Sebastodes atrovirens, S. rastrelliger, and
a number of the Embiotocidae. Jones concentrated on more general
aspects of the biology of this isopod in relation to his interest in
the Macrocystis beds of southern California. Unfortunately, little or no
published work has appeared on the green colour variety of this
species, which occurs in association with Zostera marina Linnaeus.
As no specimens of the green colour type were available at the
study site, Monterey Bay, California, this authour focused her
investigations on the brown type, found abundantly in kelpbeds
composed primarily of Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh. The experiments
herein described were conducted to determine the substrate preferences
and other factors influencing the aggregation and distribution
within the kelp beds.
Results
Field Investigations
An initial study of distribution was carried out to determine whether
these animals were randomly or otherwise distributed, within the confines
of a single Macrocystis plant in the field. Animals were counted on two
separate occasions between 1200 and 1600 hours. In addition the number
