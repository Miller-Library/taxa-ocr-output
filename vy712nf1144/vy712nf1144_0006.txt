Substrate Selection by 1. resecata
2. No animals were found on stipe more than ten feet below
the surface, nor on the blades.
3. No correlation was observed between numbers of isopods and the condition ot
the alga on which they occurred.
4. 1. resecata prefers the outer layers of Nereocystis to the
cortex, and to Macrocystis.
5. This isopod prefers Macrocystis to Zostera as a food substrate.
6. The animals may be attracted to Macrocystis and members of
their own species by soluble factors.
