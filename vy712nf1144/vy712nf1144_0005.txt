Substrate Selection by 1. resecata
stipe, was shown by Nicholson (1968) to be the area of greatest
transport of photosynthate.
A study of these isopods over a long time period is very much needed.
The location of these isopods during the winter months when the kelp breaks
up remains to be determined. It is most definitely an interesting
question for further research.
Jones (1971) describes a series of experiments which he describes
as "feeding choice". This authour stipulates that his experiments measured not
feeding choice but substrate choice. His particular series of experiments
were carried out without regard to which alga was actually consumed.
Instead his measurements are of choice of substratum for settling.
The experiments reported in the current study were directed toward
examination of food preference.
The use of Nereocystis in these studies resulted in unexpected results.
This authour's hypothesis would be that there is a substance "distaste¬
ful" to the isopod which is contained in the cortex of the Nereo¬
cystis. Such an hypothesis remains as yet untested.
The importance of these isopods in the kelp bed community has
been pointed out above. The effect of these animals on this par¬
ticular marine habitat must receive additional attention.
Summary
Substrate selection and distribution of the isopod Idothea resecata
was studied in relation to Macrocystis kelp beds in Monterey Bay,
California.
1. Field studies showed that this isopod prefers floating
stipe to other portions of the plant.
