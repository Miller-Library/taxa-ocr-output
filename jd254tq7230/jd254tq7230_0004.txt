We counted and recorded all animals found within the boundaries marked out by
the chains, with the exception of some bryozoans, sponges, tunicates, and amphipods,
which were considered too difficult to count. Large anemones were occasionally counted
as a half, or quarter, individual if their bodies were crossed by a chain boundary. Although
we lifted algal cover to count species on the substrate below it, we rarely removed the algae
altogether, and if we did, we counted all the species attached to the algae before removing
it. We turned over only one small boulder in order to count the species under it. This was
the only boulder we encountered that could be overturned.
Counting was done at low tide when most of the square being counted was above
the water level. This required that the counting be done at all hours of the day, which may
have skewed the results somewhat, as some species are normally only observed at night.
However, except for highly secretive or highly mobile animals, we assumed that any
variation in species behavior between night and day low-tides, such as differing
distributions on the rock surface, would not translate into a difference in the total number of
individuals observed per square.
RESULTS
A total of 8146 individual organisms belonging to 69 species were
observed. The abundance of two other species were noted but numbers of individuals were
not counted. The data for all 19 squares is presented in table 1, along with Hewatt's data
for comparison.
DISCUSSION
For the nineteen squares surveyed, we observed 22 species not noted by Hewatt in
his list of 170 species he found in the intertidal zone. Twelve species were observed by
Hewatt that would have been recognizable to us, but we did not find them. Nine species
observed by Hewatt may have been present during our study but we did not identify them
