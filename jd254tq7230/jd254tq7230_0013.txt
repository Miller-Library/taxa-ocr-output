because of the presence of the marine station, subject to more intense observation that the
surrounding areas(Chuck Baxter, pers. comm.). In this sense, the intertidal zone here can
be used as an early warning system in terms of shifts in species range and their potential
consequences. In light of all of the resources currently being directed into the study of
large scale climatological change such global warming, the results of this simple study
suggest that intertidal organisms may be an easily observable method of monitoring such
changes. Comprehensive studies should have begun decades ago, but better late than
never.
Subtidal Evidence
Although the subtidal community was beyond the scope of this project, several
examples if similar species shifts in the subtidal came to our attention during the course of
our research. The Macrocystis kelp beds, for example, were described in 1935 as
consisting of"... almost pure strands of Macrocystis integrifolia..." (Andrews, 1945).
Observations by Pearse and Lowry (1974) indicate that the dominant species is now
Macrocystis pyrifera. According to Miller and Geibel (1973) M. integrifolia is a northem
species whose souther limit is Monterey Bay and M. pyrifera is a southern species that
only extends as far north as Half Moon Bay.
Another subtidal example is the southern species Kelletia kelletii, whose range is
listed as Point Conception to Baja California (Morris, et al, 1980). Herllinger (1981)
reports observing a total of five adult Kellitia at several different points in the kelp forests
along the shore of Monterey County. Since then, the population has apparently increased
and there is evidence that they are successfully reproducing this far north (C. Baxter, pers
comm.). These two examples suggest that a survey of subtidal populations around
Hopkins would produce results similar to those we observed in the intertidal.
