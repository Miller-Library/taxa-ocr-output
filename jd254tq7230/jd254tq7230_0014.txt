The most important conclusion of this study is that there is great lack of
understanding about large-scale ecological changes that are occurring within the intertidal
zone at Hopkins Marine Station. This is not entirely surprising, considering that the last
broad focused ecological study of the area was done over 60 years ago by Hewatt. Our
study only begins to discover the many changes that have occurred in this ecosystem since
that time. Likewise, it only begins to suggest a few of the many questions that will need to
be answered if we are to understand and appreciate the effects of large scale climatic
changes. We hope that our work can be used as a baseline for future studies of that type,
and we further hope that these studies are carried out far more frequently than once every
60 years.
Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Jenny Hodge, Ravi Chandrasekaren and Kim Hoke for
getting up at 3 am and climbing around on the cold wet rocks when one of us couldn't
make it. Jim Watanabe for his help on analyzing our raw data. Alan Baldridge and Susan
Harris for putting up with our mess in the library. Molly "Mola-mola" Cummings for all
her enthusiasm and good spirit. The seals for their patience when we disturbed their naps
(they needed the exercise, anyway). And all the tiny critters who sacrificed their lives for
this project when we inadvertently squashed them while working in the intertidal.
And of course our deepest gratitude to our advisor Chuck Baxter, without whom
this project would never have happened.
