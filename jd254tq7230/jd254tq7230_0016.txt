Figure 1. A map of the area around the Hopkins Marine Station. The transect is indicated
by the solid line.
Figure 2.
Photograph of the transect are
a. Photograph of the intertidal behind the Loeb Laboratory. The yellow line
marks the easter boundary of the transect.
b. Photograph of Hewatt's second benchmark, at the base of square 16.
c. Photograph of Hewatt's third benchmark, at the base of square 66.
Figure 3.
Photograph of the PVC square used in collecting data.
Figure 4.
Photograph of the same square laid out on the rock surface by means of PVC
chains. Additional chains were added to break the square up into smaller
squares to make counting easier.
Figure 5.
Mean annual surface water salinity, 1920-1975. Data is taken from daily
readings made at Hopkins Marine Station. No readings were taken after 1975.
Figure 6.
Mean seasonal surface water temperature. The solid line is the mean
temperature calculated for the years 1983-1993. The dashed is the same mean
for the years 1921-1931. Data was calculated from ten day means of daily
readings taken at the Hopkins Marine Station.
Figure 7.
Mean annual surface water temperature, 1920-1991. Data is taken from daily
readings made at Hopkins Marine Station. The shaded line represents a linear
regression of the data showing an annual increase of .012 degree per year.
Figure 8.
Mean monthly air temperature. The solid line is the calculated mean for the
years 1983-1993, the dashed line is the mean for the years 1931-1947. Data is
taken from mean monthly air temperature calculated by the U.S. Weather
Service for the Del Monte Weather Station.
Figure 9.
Mean monthly precipitation. The solid line is the calculated mean for the years
1983-1993, the dashed line is calculated for 1911-1930 and the dotted line
represents the years 1931-1952. Data is taken from monthly precipitation totals
published by the U.S. Weather Service for the Del Monte Weather Station.
Figure 10. Bar chart showing the changes in total numbers of species present for ten
southern species. Asterisks indicate changes significant at the 5% level using a
paired t-test. Solid bars are numbers observed in this study, hollow bars are
numbers observed by Hewatt (1934)
Figure 11. Bar chart showing the changes in total numbers of species present for six
northern species. Asterisks indicate changes significant at the 5% level using a
paired t-test. Solid bars are numbers observed in this study, hollow bars are
numbers observed by Hewatt (1934).
Figure 12. Bar chart showing the changes in total numbers of species present for twenty-
six cosmopolitan species. Asterisks indicate changes significant at the 5% level
using a paired t-test. Solid bars are numbers observed in this study, hollow
bars are numbers observed by Hewatt (1934). The four species on the right are
plotted on the second axis, with the darker bars representing our study.
