changes is Serpulorbis could best be viewed as one small part of the more general question
of changes in all species along the transect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site Description
The geology of the study site was described by Hewatt (1934) as quartz-diorite,
characterized by "...many large, granite boulders and by rocky islands which project above
the water level..." Hewatt also provided descriptions of the water and air temperatures,
light conditions, precipitation, and tidal conditions of the site. With the exceptions of what
is discussed specifically in this paper, these are assumed to have not changed significantly.
Study Location
Using the descriptions and diagrams found in Hewatt, 1934, we located two of the
four brass pegs that mark the line on which Hewatt conducted his ecological transect. It
should be noted that although Hewatt mentions that the pegs were established with the help
of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, they are not official benchmarks, and
should not be confused with the official USC&GS benchmark which is located on shore
and to the west of the transect area. This confusion is likely the reason L.M. Hodgson
(1979) incorrectly marked the location of Hewatt's transect in her map of the Hopkins
refuge.
The first peg is set in a relatively flat slab of granite about 25 yards out in the
intertidal zone at a tidal level of 3.82 feet above the mean lower low water mark (MLLW)
and approximately one foot to the west of the eastern edge of the transect line (Hewatt,
1934). The second peg is located on the west facing side of a low, algal covered slab, 49
yards from the first peg at a bearing of N.38Â° (adjusted for declination). It is right on the
easter edge of the transect. Hewatt notes that there are two other pegs on the transect line;
one further up on shore from our first peg, and another further out from our second peg, in
the mussel beds, but we were unable to locate these. In order to make it easier for future
