The second set of field experiments was carried out a week later at 2.4
m. Only the full copper-treteane
this time replicated 3 times (Sites 45, and 6) All replicateswereagain
within 25 m or less of an adult Marraystis, and within 13 m of one
another. 8 gametophyte slides (density 603 gametophytes m-2) we
plac√©d on each patio stone. Two slides from each stone were collected after
14 hours, 2 days, 5 days, and 7 days. No recruitment control slides were
used
As an additional control during each field experiment, 2 extra
gametophyte sideswrearieuteiea

additional mortality over slides remaining in lab. Other experimenters have
