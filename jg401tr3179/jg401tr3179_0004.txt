(1969), Deysher and Dean (1986), and Reed (in prep.). Gametophyte cultures
were grown on frosted glass slides (Fisher fully frosted cytology slides) at
densities from 33 mm2 to 180 mm2 Glass slides weree
settling surface because they are easily manipulated and they facilitate
microscopic viewing of the gametophytes. Ripe sporophyseed
from the kelp bed off of Hopkins Marine Station Spore release as achieved
by cleaning 20 or so ripe sporophylls with a paper towel to remove any
epiphytes, and then soaking the sporophylls in chilled filtered seawater for
2-3 nours. The density of the resulting spore solution was measured usin
nemacytometer. Densities used for plating ran from 8.1X10sp
to 5.9 X 100 spores mi-1. The solution was poured 3 to 4 cm high in a tray
holding trosted glass slides. Thesporeswa
befère the trays were washed in frech filtered sea water. After three days
the gametophytes were large enough to clearly count and identify under a
4 objective of a compound microscope. Gametophyte survivorship was
measured by scanning 15 evenly-spaced25 m fields onidO
the middle inch of each slide was ezamined, leaving an inch on each side to
manipulate the slides in the field. All slides were kept subered
filtered sea water in a Plexiglass slide holder during viewing. Table 1 shows
