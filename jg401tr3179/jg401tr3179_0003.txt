Thetw most common species of Tegua in the Hopkins kelp forest
are Trunes which is most abundant from O-6 m, and T pullig which is
abundant in deeper water. A third congener, T monterey is less common
but is found at depthe similar to T pullige (Lowry et al. 1974, Watanabe
19845) Although the majority of the snails are found up on kelp plants, a
substantial number can also be found on the substrate. Densities of these
snails on the substrate has been quantified by Watanabe (1982) and Harroid
et al. (1988).

The technique of artificial seeding of Mroyss has been well
deweloped and used extensively. My procedure was similar to that used by
number of experimenters, including Neushul (1963), Anderson and North
