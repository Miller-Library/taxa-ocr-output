sea table near the patio stones. Observations were made several times a day
After 5 days, all of the Macr√¶ystis from the untreated and half-copper
stones had been consumed, while the Macrocystis on the copper-treated
stone was untouched. Snails were never observed on the copper stone, while

The second sea table experiment used slides plated at a density of 600

stones and left to graze for 7 daysade
