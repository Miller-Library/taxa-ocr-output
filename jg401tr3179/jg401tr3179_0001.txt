Marroystis Fyrifers giant kelp, is a brown algae that forms a surface
canopy along the coast of North America from Baja California to San
Francisco, in South America, southern Africa, and southern Australia (Abbott
and Hollenberg 1975) It displays a typical Laminariles life cycle, with
alternation of generations from a microscopic, sexual gametophyte stage to a
large, asexual sporophyte stage (figure 1). Special fertile fronds called
sporophylis, located near the base of the kelp, release free-swimming spores
which attach to the substrate and form gametophytes. After about a month
of development (Deysher and Dean 1986), male gametophytes reease
biflagellate sperm which fertilize an egg attached to the female. The
porophyte begins growth attached to the female gametophyte. (see North
1974, Dayton 1935 for more details) Kelpforests dominated y Mayss
pyers have long been a subject of great interest because of their economie
and ecological importance. Since the advent of SCUBA, many researchers
have designed field experiments attempting to mode dyamis othe elp
forest. This has proved to be an extremely difficult task due to the complex,
interactive, and unpredictable nature of this environment.
To understand the kelp forest, one must begin with an understanding
of Marystis itself. Although studies are being carried out every day in
kelp forests around the world, thousands of questions are still unanswered.
Many inwestigators here in California have chosen to narrow down the
questions een arther, addressing the microscopie stages o theyss
life cycle. What are the dynamics of gametophyte recruitment and survival:
Whatfactors physical or environmental, control mortality? Many methods
for etudy have been developed, a few questions have been answered, but
many more remain. For example, i Mryss is fertile year round
