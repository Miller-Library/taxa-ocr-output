what could have caused the other 90? I attribute agood deal of this
mortality to environmental factors. At 7.6 m, surge caused the plates to be
scoured by both sediment and algal fronds. Site 3wionise
showed the highest mortality of the 3deepsites, was found covered by a
drifting adult Maroyss on day 6. Asstated beore 10mg-
sediment can significantly affect mortality (Devinny and Volse. 1978).
l believe environmental pressures caused most of the mortality on my
plates in the experiment at 2.4 m. After 7 days, gametophyte density was

unlikely Surge was heavy every day of the week-long experiment. Large
tragments of algae carried by the surge lowered underwater visibility
considerably and wereseen to be souring the plates during all dives. Low
light scour and water motion could all have contributed to mortality.
Weather conditions such as this clearly indicate the viability of Deysher and
Deans (1985) 'recruitment window hypthesis.
