experiments at 7bmare combined. Data was analyzed using a 2-way
analysis of variance from the IBM software package, SPSS/PC (Table 2). To
simplify analysis, data from the half-copper treatment was not considered
(see discussion). Statistically significant (pe05) differences were seen
between copper-treated and untreated plates. Significant (pe.05)
difierences were alsoseen between individual replicates of the ame
treatment, with site 1 always having higher survival than site 3.
The results of the experiment at 2.4 mare presented separately in
figure 5. It is clear from the figure that no difference between treatments
wasfound in this experiment and bothtreatments experienced over 95
mortality within a week, resulting in an overall gametophyte density of less
than 2 gametophytes mmTherefore noatistia test were done.
