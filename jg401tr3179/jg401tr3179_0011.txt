The question of wte obsevedes wedue
enhancement effect of copper on gametophyte survival have not been
anewered unequivocallyTpie
strongly point to a rejection of this hypothesis. First, copper is known to
inhibit gametophyte growth even at concentrations as lowas 100 pp (Smith
and Harrison, 1979). No evidene of enhancement of any kind has been

predictible pattern, as it would if copper was affecting gametophytes
directly. Sometimes this treatment mimicked the effects of the full-copper
treatment sometimes it mimicked the bare concrete treatment, and
sometimes it fell directly between the two. I believe that this is due to the
observed behavior of individual snails when encountering the half-copper
stones. Snails would climb onto the plate or avoid it, depending only on
hich area of the stone the snail first encountered
This experiment has shown that grazers have an effect on

the Monterey Eay kelp forest. I am convinced that they play a minor role,
and that they will eat gametophytes i they happen upon them. Te
definitive solution to the mystery of high gametophyte mortality will most
likely lie in a combination of factors, both physical and biological.
