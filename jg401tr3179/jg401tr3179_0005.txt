All field experiments were done in the keip beds off of Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, CA, USA (360 36 .

In the field slides were held by surgical tubing attached to 25.4 cm X
15.2 cm X 0.6 cm Plexiglass sheets. The Plexiglass was attached with 2
masonry screws to circular concrete patio stones, 30.5 om diameter and 5.1
em thick. For each set of three treatments, I painted the entire outer
circumference of one patio stone with copper paint (Interlux Copper-Lux
Antifouling Bottom Paint, 66 58 cuprous oxide), left one bare, and painted
one in alternating 450 arcs of copper paint and bare concrete. Each patio
stone could hold up to 8 microscope slides. (Figure 2)
