Rice and Cotsirilos
Summary—Feeding
1. All five species involved in the feeding study consistently
accepted algal pieces larger than tentacular clearance dim¬
ensions, indicating that while tentacular contact occurred,
ingestion was still allowed.
Consistent rejection of sand grains smaller than readily
2.
accepted algal patches suggests that a screening mechanism
is indeed available to tunicates but does not operate strictly
on size of the particle encountered. This rejects Hecht's
(1918) appraisal that ascidians select their diet on the
basis of size alone which would predict that larger particles
are preferentially excluded.
The force of contact applied by an ingested particle on the
tentacle network is closely correlated to its probability
of being rejected. Dropped sand grains, accelerated by
gravity, are more likely to be ejected than a grain of com¬
parable size gently rolled into the oral siphon.
Hecht (1918) proposed that detection of ingested matter
occurred at the tentacle screen, suggesting innervation of
these tentacles. We support this conjecture.
