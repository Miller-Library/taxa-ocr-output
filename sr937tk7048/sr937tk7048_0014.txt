Summary-fecal pellet contents
1. Diatoms and dinoflagellates account for a large percentage
of a tunicate's diet.
2. An increase in diatom content in identical fecal weights
correlates well with increasing numbers of digested diatoms.
3. No correlation is seen between the gross structure of fecal
pellets and their contents.
4. In our sample, species morphology appeared related to
dinoflagellate abundance in their fecal pellets. Perhaps
the taller individuals (Styela) or stalked colonials are
feeding upon a water column containing more dinoflagellates
than are those species growing closer to the substratum.
