Introduction
In their surveys of size and shape of marine invertebrate
fecal pellets, Edge (1934) and Arakawa (1971) demonstrated that
pellets from the few species of tunicates they examined differ¬
ed in morphology. Whether these differences were specific to
the species, as shown by Arakawa (1971) for the three species
of Styela, or different because of food choice was not consider¬
ed by these authors.
While mechanisms associated with feeding such as pumping
rates, pumping rhythm, filtration rates and filtration efficiency
have been studied in ascidians (Fiala-Médioni 1978 a ,b,
and e), the fate of particles taken in during these active pro¬
cesses has not been looked into. That many of these particles
serve as food is a reasonable surmise, but some such particles
may be ingested by accident.
A study of size, type and number of particles ingested in
field populations of tunicates was undertaken. Laboratory feed¬
ing studies were subsequently performed to determine both poten¬
tial food kind and size and also how a tunicate might actively
exclude particular items from entering its digestive tract.
