Abstract
Fecal pellets of seven species of tunicates (Ascidiacea)
were collected from animals inhabiting the same intertidal
habitat near Pacific Grove, California in order to assess the kinds
material ingested. Two additional species were studied but
of
their fecal pellets were not examined. Dry weight per pellet
was established for all species and 5.0 x 10 5g of fecal matter
from each were compared microscopically. Of a variety of ma¬
terials tabulated, diatoms and dinoflagellates were the most
abundant. Species that had very high numbers of diatom frustules
also had a large number of digested diatoms. Tunicates pro¬
ducing pellets with large numbers of dinoflagellates were of a
different species and morphology than those showing diatoms to
dominate.
Five species of tunicates were selected for laboratory feed¬
ing studies and involved solitary, social, and colonial animals.
Graded sizes of two Macrocystis species ( brown algae) and sand
grains were offered. Larvae of the barnacle Pollicipes polymerus
(Sowerby,1833) were fed to the three largest animals (Styela mon-
terevensis Dall, 1872; Ascidia ceratodes Huntsman, 1912; and
Perophora annectens Ritter, 1893) and Ascidia tadpoles were
introduced to the two solitary species. The acceptance and re¬
jection of these food items was observed in connection with mouth
size and tentacular screens. Items with diameters too large to pass
the screen without striking a tentacle were found in fecal pellets
while smaller ones were occasionally rejected. Our observations
indicate that the tentacles show important activity when encountered
with potential food particles.
