Results--Feeding
The two Macrocystis species were ingested by all five tun¬
icates. Animals with larger mouth sizes ingested greater sized
algal fragments (figure 3). Large plant material tended to be
rejected unless the individual was introduced and habituated to
smaller food items first. When algal clumps entered oral siphons,
a violent contraction of the pharyngeal cavity and subsequent
expulsion of the plant matter occurred. Algal fragments were
larger or comparable to the largest inorganic rocks found during
pellet examinations.
Dimensions of the largest sand grains found in waste prod¬
ucts of each species exceeded the tentacular clearance dimensions.
Largest dimensions of algal patches also exceeded tentacular
clearance restrictions in all species except Synoicum.
When individually introduced, Pollicipes larvae were ingested
and digested by the largest sized animals—Styela, Ascidia, and
Perophora. Larvae fed in large quantities, however, were
actively rejected by all three tunicates. Larvae dimensions ex¬
ceed or match tentacular clearance estimates but are smaller than
all mouth sizes (figure 4). Ascidia larvae averaging 0.85 mmx 0.12
mm were introduced to and digested by Styela and Ascidia.
Sand grains of 0.6 mm cross-section were fed to Styela
and Ascidia. It was impossible to experimentally introduce
smaller grains. Twenty-five grains were individually placed into
their oral siphons at one minute intervals and all were rejected.
