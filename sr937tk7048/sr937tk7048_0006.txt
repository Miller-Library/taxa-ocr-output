fed algae of known maximum size acceptance to demonstrate its
ability to feed while inverted. Sand grains were then intro¬
duced and responses were noted.
Mouth sizes and tentacular screens were measured with an
ocular micrometer and sketched to scale (figure 4). Mouth dimen¬
sions and tentacular shape, organization and orientation were
measured for Perophora, Synoicum and A. psammion during carmine
intake and diagrams are replicas of a feeding zooid. Styela and
Ascidia tentacular networks were taken from preserved and anasthe-
tized animals respectively and measured from the inside. Tentac¬
ular clearance, a measure of the largest sphere and rectangle
that could slip through the tentacles without contact, was estab¬
lished for each species (figure 4).
