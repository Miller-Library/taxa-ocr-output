Methods and Materials
The following ascidians: Styela monterevensis (Dall, 1872),
Ascidia ceratodes (Huntsman, 1912), Clavelina huntsmani (Van Name,
1931), Perophora annectens (Ritter, 1893), Synoicum parfustis
(Ritter & Forsyth, 1917), Polyclinum planum (Ritter & Forsyth, 1917),
Archidistoma molle (Ritter, 1900), Archidistoma psammion (Ritter &
Forsyth, 1917) and Aplidium solidum (Ritter & Forsyth, 1917) are
available in the intertidal off Mussel Point at Hopkins Marine Station,
and were chosen for this study. A channel subject to heavy surf
action was selected in order to obtain Styela which appeared to
prefer the well-exposed, low intertidal zones. Species were collect¬
ed within a 10 m radius. Barnacles, clams, and other encrusting or¬
ganisms were trimmed off the colonial species to prevent mixing of
waste materials. Tunic and substratum surfaces were washed free of
debris. Specimens were placed in cut polyvinylchloride tubing (15 cm
diameter) with Nitex 0.15 mm weave floors which allowed for water
exchange but prevented fecal pellet loss. One hundred pellets were
collected from each species, except from Styela which produces con¬
siderably larger pellets. Eighteen millimeters of Styela fecal
matter was obtained. Pellet weights were obtained in order to con¬
duct a cross species comparison of food content between identical
masses of fecal matter. All samples were rinsed twice in fresh
distilled water to remove salt residue. Twelve glass vials were baked
for 1 h at 70° C. and then vacuum desiccated for 48 h. Crystalline
phosphoric acid was the desiccating agent. Dry vial weights were
obtained with a Mettler balance accurate to 1.0x 10 ' g. Pellet
samples were
