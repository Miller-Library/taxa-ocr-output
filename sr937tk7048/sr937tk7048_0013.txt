Rice and Cotsirilos
that they span the tentacle mesh with little chance of eliciting
a rejection response. Barnacles force-fed in large numbers to
both species were readily rejected; presumably their additive
mass and appendage movements are enough to stimulate an expulÂ¬
sive contraction by the larger ascidians. Perophora repeatedly
repulsed larvae but fecal analysis indicated that they were indeed
ingested and digested by this tunicate. Careful procedures in
larvae selection ensured that only live animals were fed, thus it
can be assumed that larvae cleared the tentacular screens,
regardless of appendage movements. Perophora only allowed the
smallest of larvae to pass into its gut, suggesting that they
stimulated the tentacles the least.
