Rice and Cotsirilos
Suggestions for further study
1. An interesting follow-up to this project would be to elucidate
the maximum sized particle a species might be able to digest.
Perhaps tentacular irritation can be bypassed by anastheti¬
zation, in which case a large organic particle could be pass¬
ed through the tentacles into the branchial basket. Ob¬
servations on the fate of this artificially fed particle
could be made after the animal recovers.
2. Mechanism used to construct the species specific fecal
architecture and location of these mechanisms within the
digestive tract could be studied by examining the consis¬
tency and shape of fecal material at different sites of the
tract.
