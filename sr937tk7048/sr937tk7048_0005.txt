examined microscopically for remnant carmine. The first appear¬
ance of red particles enveloped within the mucous rope was scored
as a laboratory digestive time (table 1).
Food material included Macrocystis spp., Pollicipes larvae,
Ascidia tadpoles and sand grains. Detrital Macrocystis spp.
blades were collected and allowed to decompose for 3 days in
stagnant water before grinding in a blender. Algal pieces of
2.20-1.35 mm, 1.35-1.00 mm, 1.00-0.56 mm, 0.56-0.25 mm, 0.25-
0.15 mm, 0.15-0.10 mm, and less than 0.10 mm were obtained by
straining through Nitex and geological sieves. Animals were
initially fed the smallest algal sizes mixed with carmine to
habituate them to the food item. Running water assured continual
plant fragment circulation. At 5 min intervals small amounts of
the next largest size category were added. Pellets were chron¬
ologically examined and size of largest algal fragments were
noted (see figure 3).
Pollicipes larvae studies were carried out in still water
under the dissecting microscope to allow for behavioral response
observations. Species were simultaneously introduced to carmine,
larvae and algal fragments of size 0.25-0.15 mm after habituation
to the maximum algal fragment proven to be acceptable in the feeding
studies. Larvae were present during active feeding on carmine
and algae. Fecal pellets were examined for larval remains.
Sand grains and Ascidia larvae were fed to Styela and
Ascidia. The inert particles proved too heavy for Styela to suck
into its curved siphon so the animal was inverted. Styela was
