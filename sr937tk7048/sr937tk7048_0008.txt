Discussion—Fecal pellet contents
It is assumed that all species were exposed to uniform
environmental conditions since they were collected from the same
site within a 10 m radius. Some of the species, however, had
several times as many diatom remains in their fecal pellets than
did others. Species which take in the most diatoms leave the
highest proportion of diatoms digested. (Digested diatoms are
defined as those frustules partially or completely emptied of
contents.) This correlation indicates that they are efficiently
digesting the food source which is most often seen in their
fecal pellets.
Fecal pellet architecture was compared between species in
light of the data presented in figure 1. No correlation was
observed between fecal pellet contents and pellet structure.
Any settling of diatoms upon or close to the substratum
could potentially create higher densities there and facilitate
ingestion by encrusting species such as A. molle and Ap. solidum.
If diatoms come to rest upon the tunics of these colonies then
they are in an excellent position to be taken into the oral
siphons.
The greater number of dinoflagellates in pellets from
Group L indicate that species with oral siphons located some
distance above the substratum are more likely to ingest dino¬
flagellates. Whether this is due to a lower abundance of dino¬
flagellates close to the substratum or to some selective action
of the intake mechanism is not clear. Since most of the dino¬
flagellates counted ranged in size from 15-20 um, and tentacular
