against the tentacular screen, especially when dropped through
the water column, exceeded that of algal fragments and provoked
rejection.
Observations on oral tentacular sensitivity were also made
in Hecht's study of A. nigra. He performed similar sand grain
experiments. Pharyngeal contractions following ingested sand
grains led him to discount earlier hypotheses by Roule and
Lecaze Duthiers et Delage who both suggested non-innervation of
tentacular screens. Our study supports Hecht's theory that oral
tentacles are innervated and capable of excluding certain items
from entering the digestive tract.
Pollicipes larvae were used to determine if live animals
were acceptable to tunicates. Their mass was less than the
rejected rocks and they were not limited to free-falling motion
due to their own mobility. Observations on Synoicum indicated
that larvae could actually swim against an incurrent of carmine
and were often seen swimming in the siphon opening but not
actually striking the tentacles. An errant leg of the larva
against the tentacles would elicit a brief contraction, ejecting
the barnacle larva from the oral siphon. Entanglement within
the tentacular screen and ensuing frenzy of beating appendages
by the larva initiated violent contractions by the tunicates,
preventing ingestion of barnacle larvae. Styela and Ascidia
accepted larvae readily. It is plausible that these largest
ascidians, due to their powerful water intake, frequently ingest
larvae parts (or particles of equal mass) and are therefore
insensitive to them. Larvae may also be moving so rapidly
