Rice and Cotsirilos
gathered in 2 ml of fresh deionized water and placed in separate
vials, leaving five controls. The same baking and drying pro¬
cedures were repeated and dry weight per pellet was established
for each species. An average weight reduction of 1.1 x 10
(R = 1.0 x 10  g to 1.2 x 10"4 g) was observed for the five
control vials and was added to dry pellet weights in order to
correct for them. Water weight as a source of error was elimin¬
ated by obtaining dry weight data and vials were handled with
forceps to avoid fingerprint weight.
In late May these species were collected within a 10 m
radius. In the laboratory, tunicates were rid of extraneous
external material, and 1.0 x 10" g of fecal matter was collect¬
two glass slides
ed from each species. Pellets were evenly spread between,and a
grid was etched to determine area. Half of the total fecal area
was examined at 450 X from different sections of the grid in
order to observe random parts of the fecal matter.
Laboratory feeding studies were performed on Styela,
Ascidia, Perophora, Synoicum and A. psammion. Digestive times
for each species were obtained in order to predict elimination
time of a given ingested particle. Collected animals were
placed in the Nitex containers for a minimum of 1 h. A carmine¬
seawater suspension was gradually introduced after verifying
that zooids were relaxed and expanded. Due to its larger size,
Styela was placed on a non-toxic clay base in a beaker receiving
running water. After 10 min of active carmine ingestion, sub¬
sequently voided pellets were rinsed in carmine-free water and
