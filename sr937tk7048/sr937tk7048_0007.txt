Results—Fecal pellet contents
Figure 1 shows in descending order, the abundance of dia¬
toms within a 50 ug fecal sample from each of seven species of
tunicates. Mean weight per pellet was calculated for each species
and is shown in table 1. A large number of empty diatom frustules
occurred in identical fecal weights of all the species. A
portion of these could have been present in the water column
and a portion entering as food. Dinoflagellates, the second
most numerous item found in the pellets were within the size
ranges of the diatoms, but of different shapes.
Table 2 divides the seven species into two groups accord¬
ing to individual or colony shape. Polyclinum and Synoicum
are lobed colonies attached to the substratum by stalks.
These two were placed in Group L along with Clavelina and Styela
which are also lobed with their oral siphons elevated above the
substratum. Aplidium solidum, A. psammion and A. molle comprise
Group M, which are encrusting mounds growing in close proximity
to the substratum. Fecal pellets from species in Group L con¬
tain more dinoflagellates per ug than species in Group M.
