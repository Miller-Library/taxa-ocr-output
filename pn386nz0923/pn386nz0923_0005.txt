ue in the

itting the nerve and
electrode tip. The nerve was then stimulated presynaptically via
the pallial nerve, with pulses of 10 -80 V lasting from 0.1 to 0.5
msec. Time between action potentials was obtained by using the
storage oscilloscope cursor movement function (Os explained in
Fig. 2). The distance between electrodes was measured using a
piece of wire and calipers.
For the in vive experiments, the animals were narcotized
in a solution of 1.5 -22 ethanol in natural seawater, for 3 to 5
minutes, or until respiratory movements were minimal. The Leligg
was then transferred to a dissecting dish, the dorsal skin above
the stellate ganglions removed, and the mantle tissue above the
ganglions carefully removed, so as nat to damage the ganglion.
The animal was attatched to a plesiglass restraint (See Fig. 3)
with superglue. The squid was clearly able to perform normal
respiratory, swimming and jetting movements. Here, the animal
was transferred to a plexiglass hox (8"xS"x5") filled with seawater
maintained at 10 -14 C. One suction electrode was placed on the
second, third or fourth stellar nerve (See Fig. i) at the loose
segment as they leave the ganglion. Often the nerve was sucked
into the electrede tip, and better quality recording resulted.
An absolute pressure transducer (sliding resistor coil)
whose resistance varied linearly with pressure, was connected to
a tube filled with mineral oil, which was inserted through ansther
hole (not above the ganglion) in the squid's mantle. The
transducer was wired into a Wheatstone bridge with a variable
resistance component, so that output current could be adjusted.
Using the "balcen pop test" the transducer was determined to have
within a two millisecond respense to a step change in pressure.
The transducer was not calibrated.
