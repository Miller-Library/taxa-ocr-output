activatine circular muscie in the mantle, probably of thes
type (Bone and Pulsford, 1948). The giant fibre spikes would
then activate faster twitch muscle tissue in the mantle, which
isthe most abundant muscle tisse (Sosline. Ei. Am.. 185).
The numerous large spikes surrounding every giant spike could be
signals sent to slower acting circular muscle. It is clearly
evident that the giant spike, if one occurs during a jet, is
"held back", perhaps so that large spike output to the circular
muscles can arrive synchronously with the much faster conducting
giant fibre cutput.
Mast exciting is the observation that the giant fibre
system does not make the escape responses any faster as
J. E. Young suppossed. Rather it seems that the system can
increase the strength of the jet and probably developed to increase
synchronicity of a strong muscle cantraction. The records showing
multiple giant spikes are equally remarkable, because they
indicate that strength of contraction can he graded by the numbem
of spikes fired as mell. Undoubtedly, more careful experimentation
will be done with pressure traneducens to elucidate the specific
montribution of a system capable of multiple spikes.
Lastly, the fact that the giant fibre system does not aid
the animal in quikening the response time to a threatening stimulus
indicates that it probably developed in animals which already had
an escape response (most likely mediated by the same large amplitude
fibres seen in my recordings). Thus the newly evolved giant fibre
network would have to "hold back" to be synchronous with the
slower, previously developed system.
