Haterials and Hethods
Lolige Opalescens, the animals used in this study, were
chtained from Monterey Bay, Monterey, Ca. They were maintained
in large circular holding tanks (ca. 2m in diameter and im deep).
Ihe experimental animals were typically 7 to 12 cm in mantle length.
Because of the nature of the in vive preparation, only healthy,
strong swimming animals with all skin intact were chosen.
The study was divided into two experiments. Neasurements
for both parts of the study were made with en passant suction
alectrodes. The slectrodes consisted of two Agola wires, one
inside a syringe, the other wrapped arcund the flexible Nalgene
tubing tip. Another AgCla wire was inserted in the seawater
bath as a ground. The tips of all recording electrodes were
flesible Malgene tubing, drawn out over flame so that the
diamater of the and provided the best suction onto the stellar

Hecordings for both experiments were passed threugh a
preamplifier (Tektronix FM I2 to a storage cecillceroge
(Micelet Storage Oeeillsacope 2091!.
The first experiment measured conduction velscity. Ic
da this the animals mantle was cut ventrally and pinned out in
a diseection dish, with the head still intact. Water
temperature was maintained at 10 -14 O throughout the experiment.
Befgre each experiment, the water was aerated for at least 10 min.
Iws suction electrodes as described above were placed on one stellar
perye, one on the loose segment of nerve as it leaves the stellate
danglion (See Fig. 1), the other where the nerve fibre was barely
yisible, presumably close to the motor endplate. The latter
electrode was placed by removing the collagen tunic and musele layer
