Discussion
Clearly there are many important conclusions
drawn from this data. The conduction velocity data suggests that
neurel output to the endplate errives yery nearly simultanegusly.
My data indicating a 2 - 3 msec. difference for Loliga of mantle
length 10 - 20 cm. is rather consitent with data from others,
particularly Sosline, et al (J. Exp. Bio. 1983), who states that
his figures indicate better than 10 msec. synchronicity. His
animals were larger, thus his differences would be expected to be
greater. Certainly my measurements are too few to make definite
estimates of latencies, but they are a fine indication that the
system is essentially synchronous. Considering the 300 - 800
msec. (Gosline, et al, J. Exp. Bio., 1783) period of muscle
activity, this asynchranicity seems rather trivial.
The in vive experiments provide much excitng detail about
this well studied giant fibre system. The biphasic nature of
both respirations and giant fibre induced jetting suggest that
Gosline's data an hyperinflation and subsequent jetting
(J. ERp. Eio., 1783) is in fact true, given that the 400 - S0o
msec. period of large amplitude activity is being carried by
fibres innervating the radial muscles. This is consistent with
my records because the squid was tethered, and thus wasn't able
to move through the water, which normally would allow flow-induced
pressures to aid in mantle reinflation during respiration. It
would be reasonable to expect the animal to have to work harder
in this static situation during respiration and jetting alike.
Therefore nervous discharge to radial muscle fibres could be
exaggerated.
