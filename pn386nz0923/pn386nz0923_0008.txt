become distinquishable. In Figure 6, we see the 250 asec. time
periods surrounding each of the same jets that are in Fig. S.
These sequential recordings allow clear identification of the giant
spikes preceeding pressure rises in the mantle cavity (As before,
bottom traces). In the first jet of the sequence, one giant
spike is evident, 25 msec. before the pressure increase. O
pattern of much smaller amplitude, yet still large spikes
(500 - 800 uV) are still apparent, on a very similar time scale
as in the previbus trace. The pressure records are arranged so
that the rises in pressure correspond. In the Srd jet, two
giant spikes occur, the first with the same 25 msec. latency
Until pressure rises. Large spikes are also steregtypically
clustered about the giant fibre discharges. Finally, the
pressure recordings for each of the 3 jets are graded in
amplitude, with the no giant fibre spike record giving the lowest
change in pressure, and the slowest rate of pressure rise in the
mantle cavity. As expected, the pressure change for the one
diant fibre spike record is higher in amplitude, but still smaller
than the record with twe giant fibre spikes. Both pressure
tracings show a similar rate of pressure rise.
In Figure 7, there are three recordings of jet sequences
from the same animal. All three records have 2 parts, each of
different gain. The first record shows a weak jet, with no giant
fibre spike, followed by a stronger, two giant fibre spike jet,
Jet sequence number two shows 3 jets, the first two without giant
spikes, the last with only one giant spike. Lastly, the third jet
sequence displays one weak, non-giant jet and a jet with 5 giant
fibre discharges. The water artifact occuring immediately after
this final jet appears considerably larger than in the previous
