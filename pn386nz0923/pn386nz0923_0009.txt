quence. This record was not run threugh the Fi recorder, but
rather was obtained directly from the videotape. O total of six
"escape" jets occur during the course of the continuous recording,
Perhaps the most salient events in this figure are the artifacts
from the two jet sequences. These are the high amplitude, very
low frequency events occuring after each unit of three jets. The
two most notable pieces of information gained from this record are
the regular pattern of activity occuring at 1 to 2 second interyals
and the higher amplitude "breaths" seen immediately preceeding each
unit of 3 jets. One can also notice small amplitude, low frequency
events occuring after each "breath", indicitive of artifactual
seawater moyement.
Ihe Sth Figure is data obtained from FM re-recordings of a
previously videotaped experiment. It is a 3 jet sequence, and
the much faster time scale clearly affords better resolution of
nigh frequency events. The lower tracing is a record of pressure
change in the mantle cavity, and it is evident that a large
preszure increase occurs approximately 2E zec, after eome
extremely large amplitude electrical action recorded in the usser
tracing. Ihis suggests that mantle muscles have contracted,
powering the escape jet, and that these muscles have been
commanded by the large amplitude cutput occuring just previous
to the sudden pressure change. Also apparent is the biphasic
nature of the high amplitude, high frequency electrical record
preceeding the pressure change. There is a 400 - 700 msec. pericd
of high activity, followed by a relitively inactive period of
50 - 60 msec., and then an extremely large amplitude period of
70 - 80 msec. just before pressure change.
These consistent patterns become even clearer as the time
