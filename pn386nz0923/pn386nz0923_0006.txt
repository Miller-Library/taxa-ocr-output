preamplifier inte an analeg/digital processor which output
digital signals to a Betamax video recorder (This method is after
Dr. Benzanilla, Biephysical Journal, 1785). The pressure
transducer recording was run directly to the analog/digital
converter.
Stop frame analysis of the recordings was made using the
Betamax recorded data converted back to analog signals in the O/D
converter and displayed on the storage oscilloscope screen. Ihs
records could be maintained on the screen by using an outside
triggering pulse of the same frequency as the videotape sample
(16 Hz.).
Further analysis on a faster time scale was performed by
cutputting data stored on Betamax tape through the A/D converter
and taped on fast speed on an FM tape recorder (Tandberg,
Geries 115). Records were played back on slower speeds to a
brush recorder to increase time scale. Unless otherwise mentigned
all records displayed in this paper were obtained by this method.
Escape responses were induced in the animals by frightening
them with a finger, perturbing them with a dissecting togl, ory
often they responded spontaneously.
