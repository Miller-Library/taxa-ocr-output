Data gathered on the escape resper
toligo Opalescens, indicates an output through the giant fibre
system that arrives to the muscien essentially synchroncusly
(within 2 - 5 msec.). Further, the first In vive recordings
ever made on the species indicate that the giant fibre system
gives a very stereotyped pattern of discharge each time it fires.
The giant fibres do not allow the animal to escape any faster;
Howeyer. It is also obseryed that giant fibre spikes do not
always occur during jetting, that multiple spike discharges are
common, and that the number of spikes per jet control the
intensity of the jet. Finally, this data suggests a possible
course of evolution for the giant fibre pathway.
