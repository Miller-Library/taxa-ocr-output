Figure Legends
Figure 1: Pallial nerve and stellate ganglion, with
the "loose" segments of each nerve showing.
Figure 2: Oscilloscope picture, illustrating the method
used to determine conduction velocities.
Eigure : Restraint and holding bo used for in vivo
experiments.
Figure 4: Data recorded using suction electrodes,
taken directly from the Betamax recording.
"Q" - water movement artifact, "B" - breath, "J" -
jet.
Eigure 5: Sequential three jet record, with
electrical record on top, and pressure changee in
mantle on the bottom. "G" - giant spike, "K" -
proposed output to radial muscles, "C"  proposed
output to circular muscles. Time bar is 100 msec.
Eigure 6: Same three jets as in Fig. 5, on an
expanded time scale. The records are lined up to
highlight the stereotyped electrical activity,
and corresponding pressure rise. Time bar is
10 msec.
Figure 7: Ihree different jet sequences from
other animals. Both records (top and bottom) are
the same, but played out on different gain. Ihe
key is as in Fig. 5.
