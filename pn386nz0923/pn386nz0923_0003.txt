ne giant fibre systen of
uid is perbaps the most
extensively studied neurobiological preparation. Inargueably, it
has produced data on ion moyement and nervous signal condustion that
is the basis of all neurobiology. These studies were possible que
to the large sized axons that are characteristic of the system.
They allow ease in both stimulation and recording, and thus their
electrophysiological properties have been known now for over half
a century. All of this study, however, has focused on a dissected
preparation which is essentially "dead". Certainly no behaviours
can be studied, nor their neryous control, in the open-mantle,
traditional giant fibre preparation.
Honetheless, many evolutionany advantages of the fibre system
have been suggested, namely that the system has bettem synchronicity
and allows the animal to exhibit a fastem escape mesponse. As
J. E. Young wrote, "The value of systems of giant fibres to the
mimals possessing them lies presumably either in the greatem apeed
of conduction in larger axons, or in that such large fibres make it
pessible to tall inte action a large number of effecton agents
nearly simultaneously" (J. 2. Young. 1938).
The work presented in this paper addresses both of these
presuppositions directly, by using the traditional, open-mantle
preparation to determine the limit of simultaneity, and by examining
the first obtained in vive neural recordings from the stellar
nerves of Loligo Opalescens. Date collected suggests that the
former could be true, while the latter does not aid in allowing
the animal to escape faster. Furthermore, this work indicates a
probable evolutionary pathway for the development of the giant
fibre system.
