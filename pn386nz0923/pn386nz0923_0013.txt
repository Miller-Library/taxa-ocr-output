Acknoul edgenents
Dr. William Gilly deserves more thanks than I am
able to give, here in my utterly inadequate "Ack" section.
He simply was always there, to such an extent, that halfway
through the quarter, another undergraduate and I began to
speculate on whether he had another job here or not. I am
also very thankful that there is a Dr. Stuart Thompson at
H.M.S. Though I have trouble spelling his name, his timely
donations of equiptment and expertise allowed me to complete
the project. Finally, Bruce Hopkins, and Carol Marzuola
are no less wonderful for dealing with hordes of crucial
things (like supplying the animals). Their time and
attention was much appreciated.
