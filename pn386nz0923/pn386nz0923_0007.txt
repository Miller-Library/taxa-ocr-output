lable I shows the data collected in determining conduction
velocities for an average animal. As mentioned earlier, the time
of each action potential was taken from the storage oscilloscope
screen. This method was used in calculating data for three
animals, each of which produced data analogous to this example,
The arrival of signals at the admittedly very roughly estimated
endplate in this case was less than I msec. difference. In no
other example were the differences greater than 3 msec, betwsen
cutgoing signals of the giant fibres. In angther set of
observations, two suction electrodes were placed at the estimated
endplates of different nerves, and stimulation was given via the
pallial nerve. As can be seen in Table I as well, the differences
in arrival of signals using this crude method average merely 3
msec.
(he average time of impulse transmission to the estimated
endplate in all animals in all stallar nerves (End, 3rd, 4th
and Sth) was 2.9 msec. and in no case was the transmission time
to endplate greater than 5 msec.
Experiment 2: In vive regordings
As mentioned earlier, most hard copies of recordings stored
on videotape were run out on the brush recorder by using an EM
tape recorder to increase time resolution. These records proyed
to be the most informative and thus the majority of analysis was
performed using hard copy records of different speeds, made at
different gains to manipulate comparative resolution of specifis
events.
