The common cuttlefish, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sepia officinalis : Exact'>Sepia officinalis,</span> is able to exhibit
a wide yariety of body patterns. Fast studies have analyzed the
animal's ability to camouflage itself using subjective methods.
This study encorporated two objective methods, overall tone
analysis and spatial frequency of pattern analysis, to examine
how well the animal was matching its background. Un its natural
background, sand, the cuttlefish matched both tone and pattern.
On an unnatural background, such as a uniform gray, one animal
matched tone, ame matched pattern and one attempted to match both
tane and pattern. On analysis combining subjective method and
the quantitative methods described in this paper offer a more
definitive method for judging the degree to which the the animal
can match the surrounding environment in behavioral tests.
INTEODUCTICN
The cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, has fascinated biologists
because of its ability to change its skin patterns within
fractians of a zecond. Using the brown, yellow and red pigmented
ordans in their skin (chromatophores), which are under neural
control, the cuttlefish are able to exhibit a wide variety of
hody pattemns. For example, cuttlefish use patterns to scare
prey, to attract mates, and to camoflauge themselves. Early
studies, by Bott (1938) and by Tinbergen (1939) concentrated on
the cuttlefish's courtship patterns and Holmes (1940) described
various other patterns. More recently, Hanlon et. al (1986)
systematically characterised the elements and units that go to
make up the body patterns. Hanlon divided the body patterns into
a total of 34 chromatic components, 16 light and i8 dark and, in
addition, described sis textural components, 8 postural
components, and o locomator components. Textural components
reter to the texture of the animal and the dermal papillae that
can expand or contract to cause a rough or emooth surface.
Postural components refer to the way the animal is positioned.
and locomotor components to the motion of the animal. Althouch
the animal can exhibit these components in almost any
combination, Hanlon characterized 13 whole body patterns. Cott
(1940) outlined the ways in which animals can conceal themselves
from predators: colour resemblance, deceptive resemblance,
obliterative shading, disruptive colouration, coincident
disruptive colpuration and concealment. Hanlon (1986) describes
how cuttlefish employ all the techniques of colour matching set
out by Catt.
Hanlon's study describes how the cuttlefish match in a
descriptive, qualitative way; and he noted that his attempts to
quanitty matching were unsatisfactory. The purpose of this study
was to tind a more quantative, gjective way of examining the
mechaniem by which Sepia officinalis match their background
utilising recent advances in the field of digital imag
processing. Computer analysis can be used to obtain numerical
data in an accurate, rapid and reproducable manner (lnoue, 1786).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sepia : Exact'>Sepia</span> were hatched in Galveston, Texas and brought to
Hopkins Marine Station, Facific Grove, Ca. at around A menthe ot
age. The animals used were between four and five monthe old at
the time of testing. Typical mantle length of the animals was a
cm. The three animals used for the study were kept in shaded,
individual aquaria with running sea water  15" C. Fictures of
individual animals were taken on three different backgrounds: (1)
amall grained sand substrate, (E) a uniform light gray background
and (S) a mock mubstrate cantaining rocks approkimately the mame
zite as the animal, but in a variety of tomes. In an experimental
tank, the test animal was placed in a 17 cm bowl containing of
gne of the three substrates and given five minutes to aclimate.
Fictures of the cuttlefish were taken with a m Wikon camera
and twa electric flashes held on stands om sither side ot the
tank. Ektachrome 100 alide film was used. The camera was tastened
th a trippd approkimately mne meter above the tank. Since evem
slight movement often seemed to bother the animals, the pictures
were taken in a darkemed room and I stayed sitting quietly beside
the tank fom the five minutes before the pictures were taken.
In order to have some way of subjectively judging how well
the cuttlefish matched their background, the pictures of the
cuttlefish in the experimental tank were shown to 12 human
judges' who were asked to rate the cuttlefish's camoutlage
performance on a scale of O (a bad match) to 3 (a good match).
Eody patterns of the animals were classified according to
the system develcped by Hanlon (1984). The five patterne shown
by the animals were:
(1) Uniform light (see figure 2): to an overall light tone with
very few of no dark chromatophores enpanded.
(2) Stipple (see figure 4): an overall uniform tone that is
slightly darker than l due to expansion of dark chromatophor.
(3) Weak dismuptive (see figure 6): a wide variety of patterns,
with the common characteristic that the body is braken into
portions by transverse or lengitudinal elements.
(4) Weak Zebra (see figure 5): a low contrast striped patterm
also calledsandy-tripe' by Holmes (1740).
() Uniform Dark (see figure 3): expansion of all dark
chromatophores.
To objectively measure the animals ability to match its
hackground, the various slides were then digitized using a
MegaVision 1OE4-XM computer and a Panasonic black and white vided
camera, By selecting the function 'tyscannem' the colour slides
T y  array of pixels with
werestored in the computer in a
mach pixel assigned a value on a gray scale of 25 ( O being the
blatkesta-
eing the whitest). The gray scaleof the
Hegalision was fpund to be linear at all but the darkest and
whitest gray values (see figure 7). The Megavision function
'hpolygon' was used to output gray values within the area covered
by the cuttlefish, and an equal size area on the adjacent
substrate. The function 'hlist' was used to obtain the mean,
standard deviation, miniumum and maximum values, skew and
kurtosis of the histograms of the pixel gray scales from
cuttlefish and background. Each histogram quantatively measures
how well the animal was matches the oyerall tone of the
zubstrate.
A spectral analysis methed was used to determine how well the
cuttlefish were matching pattern. Spectral analysis is oftem
used to interpret time in terms of frequency (Chatfield 1784).
Im this study, it was used to comvert distance in space (on the
hack of the cuttlefish or on the substrate) into spatial
trequency. The result of the analysis is presented as a
speatrum. The abtissa represents the spatial frequency of
periodic pattemns in inverme mm. and the ordinate is the power
spentrum, a measure af the variance in gray scale associated with
mach spatial frequency (Chatfield, 1984).
The function 'profile' was used to draw a transect 9
pixels wide acros the back of the animal and an equal-length
transect through the adjacent substrate. Each pixel corresponds
to a distance in space of .Emm. The gray values obtained were
then transferred tw an IEM XI personal computer. Here, the gray
meale values were filtemed with a high pass digital filtem to
remave the mean and the first five harmonics of the fundamental
spatial frequengy. The filtering was done ta memoye the low
trequency patterns associated with the averall length of the
transect on the animal or substrate. Next, the power spectrum of
a Tho pixel series was calculated and smoothed using a nine-point
running average, and the objective measure of pattern matching
was obtained.
RESULTS
Histogram pairs of gray scale (a measure of overall tome).
ame shown in figures 8-13 for each test cuttlefish and its
background. A student t-test was performed on the means of each
pair. Due to the extremely large number of pixels in each
histmgram (n240,000), even a difference in means of one was
statistically significant. However, the human eye can only
distinguish approximately Jo shades of gray (Takahashi, 1986).
Theretere, the human eye can discern a difference in light
intensity only if two regions of the image are more than 7
(2w6/30) apart on the gray scale. The means of the histograms,
them, were comsidered 'different' if the means were farther than
apart.
Un the sand substrate, the difference in means for all three
animals was less than sevem. On the gray substrate, all animals
were greater than 7 gray scale units away from the background
mean. The histogram of the cuttlefish on the rock background was
compared to three other histegrams: that of one rock in the bowl.
the whole area of the bowl and a cuttlefish sised area within the
bowl. The cuttlefish judged the most difficult to see matched
(difference in means 47) a rock in the bowl, but not overall tome
or a cuttlefish-sied area in the bowl. Conversely, the mean of
the histogram of the animal yoted most visible did not match any
of the means.
The results of the spectral analysis are shown in tigures
14-17. The cuttlefish and its background are plotted on thesame
zet of axes. All the spectra exhibit a large peak corresponding
to a spacing of 23.T mm. This peak was theught to be an artifact
uf the filtering process and was therefore not included in the
analysis. The cuttlefish which closely match their substrate
according to the zubjective judging, show that the pattern
spacings are within .omm, at most. Those cuttlefish judged nat
to be matching have harmonics that differ by more than twoee
animal +).
IhE power spectra also compare the variance of the transect
on the cuttlefish with that of the background. Cuttletisn
photographed on sand show less variance than the substrate. The
animals phatographed on the gray background show greater variance
than the suhstrate, while those compared to the rack hackground
mhow mither more or less variance than the mock aubstrate. he
variance exhibited on the mocks does nat ampear to be asmociated
with an individual animal or the trial, as each individual showed
greater or leszer variance at different times.
Ihe resulte of the individual animals body pattern choite is
aummari zed in the bar graphs om hoth rack and gray substrates.
All the animals except for animal  n the gray background use
more than one pattern when confronted with the same substrate.
Un both the rock and gray substrates, five different body
patterns were used. Similar bar graphs for the sand trials were
not made, since all the animals matched the sand substrate well.
and all showed the same overall body pattern.
DISCUSSION
Cuttletish on the sand substrate are able to match both tone
and pattern and are subjectively well camouflaged. Since sand is
the natural habitat of the animal it seems logical that all the
animals would be able to match the sand backorpund best. When
contronted with an unnatural substrate, rocks or gray, the
cuttletish use various strategies to conceal themselyes. On the
gray background, animal  matched the uniform pattern well, but
was highly visible because of lack of tone matching, (see figure
3) Animal  matched the overall tone of the gray backargund to
within one shade of gray, but displayed a pattern that was highly
visible. (see figure 4) Animal  matched tone to within 5 shades
as well as matching pattern.
he results on the rock substrate also indicate that
different strategies can be used by the same individual.
Individuals employ at least five different body patterns to
mamoutlaque themselves on the unnatural substratee, Thus, when
placed on an unfamiliar or unnatural background, the cuttlefish
have the ability to respond in a variety of ways. The animal is
able to examine his environment and then able to chosse the
pattern and tome it will show. Evidently, the neural circuitry
involved in chromatophore response is not "hard-wired".
Similarly, the same cuttlefish does not always respond the
same way to the same background (see figure 20). With the
exception of S on the gray substrate, each of the three animals
exhibited at least two different body patterns when placed on the
same substrate repeatedly. Moreover, the patterns did not depend
on how many times the cuttlefish had seen the particular
zubstrate before.
Ihis study demonstrates a method for quantifying matching.
Uverall tone of the animal can be quantified using a digital
image processor and pattern matching can be cbjectively
determined by the power spectra. This objective, quantative
method is especially powerful for judging matching on uniform
mubstrates such am sand or the light gray background. Subjective
analysis is still necessany, especially on a complex substrate
(like a rock background), where it is not always evident how the
amimal is trying to camouflage itself. Subjective analysis and
the two cbjective methods outlined above, together provide a good
basis for judging how well, and how, cuttlefish match their
sumstrate, and the different strategies they use.
