with a skin surface area of about 0.5 m’ including fins, head and arms. Using video shots of
squid calibrated with ruler that was placed on its skin, we found that there were approximately
70 chromatophores on an area equivalent to 9 mm’, or 7.8/mm’. An independent estimate based
on the same video put chromatophore density at 10/mm’ (Packard, personal communication),
yielding a total of 5 x 10° chromatophores.
Whereas many cephalopods have several types of chromatophores that differ in
pigmentation, D. gigas appears to have just one pigment (reddish brown). Although D. gigas has
only one type of chromatophore pigment, two types of chromatophores were distinguished in this
video on the basis of size rather than pigment. The large and small chromatophores appear to be
grouped into separately controlled chromatomotor fields.
The same video segment captured distinct groups of chromatophores that expanded
synchronously upon being lightly touched. These patches varied in size between 10 and about
60 chromatophores, with a mean size of 23 chromatophores. These groups of chromatophores
probably correspond to what Messenger calls chromatomotor fields (Messenger 2001), an
amalgamation of Packard’s terms, motor field’ and ’chromatophore field’ (Packard 1974).
Packard induced local expansion with a stimulating electrode, but his chromatophore fields share
with the morphological units in the video the quality of having irregular edges that are
complementary to the edges of adjacent fields.
The touch-induced excitation also seemed to spread somewhat spontaneously to
surrounding fields, with flickering lasting up to ten seconds after the initial stimulus. This
suggests that chromatomotor field activation may be spread by muscular contraction after it has
been initiated by excitation from the CNS.
