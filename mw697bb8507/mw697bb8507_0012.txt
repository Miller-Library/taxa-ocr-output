and others that flashed continuously. However, no sex-correlated differences in flashing could
be determined because there is little sexual dimorphism in D. gigas, and none that is
distinguishable at the distances from which the video was taken. Another important difference
between the two types of flashing is that the majority of firefly flashing behaviors involve
synchronization of many individuals into either single pulses or wavelike flashes of light.
Dosidicus gigas does not appear to have such rigid behaviors, perhaps due to the fact that they
are usually in motion rather than resting stationery in trees, as the fireflies are.
In short, the flashing patterns of D. gigas are complex, involving intermittent
synchronizations between pairs as well as many intermittent individual patterns. These
observations are certainly open to revision in light of a larger corpus of data, but at present they
suggest that D. gigas uses its binary chromatophore-based signaling in multiple ways and
probably for multiple purposes. These could include intraspecific signaling relating to
navigation, aggression and mating, as well as defensive patterning directed at potential predators.
