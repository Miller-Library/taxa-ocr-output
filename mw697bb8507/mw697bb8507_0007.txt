The minimum number of flashes in a train is just one. In abnormal conditions (usually
while it was being tagged out of water), the squid sometimes flashed only its fins or arms. The
maximal rate of flashing observed was 6 flashes/sec, though most of the squid in the clips
examined flashed at a rate between 3/sec and 4/sec.
A typical flashing cycle is shown in Figure 1, a series of twelve frames spanning 333 ms.
To determine more quantitatively the flashing pattern of an individual squid, we examined
several clips of single squid that remained relatively still and stayed close to the camera for at
least five seconds. We then took intensity measurements on three or four areas of the squid’s
body and plotted these as a function of time (see Figure 2).
Along the squid body, there is no completely consistent pattern in peak ON states, but the
chromatophores on the head and arms are generally activated first. They are followed within 100
ms by mantle and fin chromatophores. However, the mantle and fins do not follow a strict
anterior-posterior waveform. Sometimes the fins are fully activated before the entire mantle
reaches its peak brightness.
Figures 3 through 5 examine the behavior of a single squid. These clips were chosen
with the criterion that there be only one individual pictured for the duration of the clip. Of
course, we cannot be sure that there were not squid nearby but outside the camera’s scope, but
given the data this seemed the most reasonable method. Figures 3a, 4a, and 5a plot the light
intensity of the squid mantle against time, while figures 3b, 4b and 5b plot the peak ON signals
against time.
These three sets of figures show the variability of D. gigas flashing behavior. The squid
analyzed in Figure 3 shows a relatively stable rate of flashing, between 11 and 12 frames per
