meters. The videos were filmed with a Sony broadcast HDTV camera and custom housing, and
directly copied onto Hi-8 master videotapes. Selected sequences from these tapes were
converted to .avi files using Adobe Premier and analyzed using ImagePro Plus. In ImagePro
Plus, we used the AOI tool and the Intensity histogram to determine the grayscale value of
selected areas of the image. At all times the original sampling rate of the video camera (30 Hz)
was conserved.
After culling data from the .avi clips, we employed Microsoft Excel 5.0 and IgorPro to
generate the graphs and figures. Excel was used to create the original spreadsheets, which were
imported to Igor to create the flashing graphs.
Further observations on chromatophore density and arrangement in D. gigas were made
using the Hi-8 tapes.
Results
The flashing behavior Dosidicus gigas is unique among the cephalopods. Instead of a
large array of patterns, Dosidicus has two states, which we have called ON and OFF. ON
indicates chromatophore expansion; the squid appears dark red. ÖFF indicates chromatophore
contraction, in which the squid has a whitish appearance.
When not flashing, the squids remain in either the ON or the ÖFF state; there is no clear
"resting state“ despite the fact that the ON state requires ongoing excitation. Moreover, squid in
the video documentation (free-swimming, at least several meters from the photographer) never
exhibited partial activation: each flash seemed to be an all-or-none phenomenon.
