whether and to what degree the two individuals adjust to the flashing behavior of their
conspecifics.
In the clip for Figure 8, one squid is swimming underneath the second, who is on a
fishing lure. Drawings along the top of Figure 8 indicate the relative positions of the two squid
during the course of the flashing sequence. The dashes below these drawings mark the peak ON
periods of the two individuals. The two are flashing synchronously for the first three seconds.
After a transition period they begin flashing exactly out of phase, and then after another
transition they move back into phase, and then out of phase. Figure 8b includes a plot of the
relative timing of each squid’s peak ON state (black line and markers). During the first segment,
when the two are synchronized, the difference in peak ON states remains close to zero. During
the transition segment the difference jumps rapidly to around half of a period (180 ms). The
final “synchronized" segment shows the difference in peak ON states grow larger and then
approach zero at the very end.
Figure 9 is drawn from a clip of two squid intermittently near and far from each other.
As the two squid approach, one is flashing steadily and the other begins to flash. They are not
perfectly synchronized, but note the crossing lines plotting periodicity, in Figure 9b. This
suggests that the two individuals are adjusting to one another’s tempo. The second squid
remains quite steady in its flashing frequency as they swim apart, while the first one ceases to
flash. As they approach one another again, the first squid resumes flashing and the second squid
begins to modulate its frequency, possibly to synchronize with the first.
We estimated the number of chromatophores on the skin of an adult Dosidicus gigas to
be 3.9 x 10°. This estimate was taken from a video of a recently sacrificed, medium-sized adult
