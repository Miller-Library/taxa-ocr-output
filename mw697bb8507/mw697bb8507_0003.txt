Introduction
Relatively little is known about Dosidicus gigas, commonly called the Humboldt squid,
red devil or jumbo squid. Three intraspecific groups have recently been distinguished by their
difference in adult size, with the largest squid reaching mantle lengths of 2 1 m and weights of
50 kg (Nesis, 1983). Adult males in the small-sized group reach 260 mm, and the medium-sized
adult males reach 420 mm. Dosidicus gigas is fished extensively off Baja California and the
California coast (37-40 deg. N) as well as the west coast of Central and South America (45-47
deg. S) (Nesis, 1970). It is epipelagic to several hundred meters, and rises to the surface both
night and day to feed. Its diet consists of fish (most commonly epipelagic lanternfish) and squid
(especially D. gigas), while it is preyed on by sperm whales, billfishes, tunas and humans
(Norman, 2000).
The life cycle of D. gigas is normally one year, and female fecundity is the highest
known among cephalopods (Nigmatullin et al., 2001). In Peruvian populations, spawning takes
place off the coast of Peru throughout the year, with a mean between October and January and a
secondary peak between July and August (Tafur et al., 2001), and planktonic larvae are carried
south to southern Peru and Chile (Fernández and Vásquez, 1995).
Beyond this broadly drawn life history, little work has been published on the behavior of
Dosidicus gigas, and what has been published is anecdotal. In particular, its flashing behavior
has never been quantified or described in any detail.
In Dosidicus as in other cephalopods, flashing is effected by millions of chromatophores,
neuromuscular organs in the dermis that are innervated by the brain. Chromatophores are tiny
cytoelastic sacs filled with pigment granules and encircled by excitatory radial muscle fibers
