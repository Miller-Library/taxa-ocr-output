cycle (or about 2.9 Hz). The following figure, Figure 4, exemplifies an intermittent flashing
pattern, in which bursts of flashing are punctuated by periods of weaker flashing or a cessation of
chromatophore activation. Finally, the graphs in Figure 5 are of a squid with a rapidly
fluctuating flashing rate (between 7 and 15 frames per cycle, or 4.7 and 2.2 Hz).
The markers at the very top of each figures 3a, 4a and 5a, are placed at each peak ON
frame to indicate the regularity and relative frequency of flashing periods.
We were also interested in answering the question of whether squids alter their behavior
on the basis of other flashing squid in their proximity. Photic waves were plotted against time
for multiple squid and their position relative to one another was noted. Graphs of this data for
five groups of squid are included in Figures 6-9.
In Figures 6-9, the first graph is a simple plot of grayscale intensity against time.
Higher grayscale values correspond to a lighter appearance, which occurs when the
chromatophores are in the ÖFF state.
Figures 6b, 7b, 8b, and 9b are plots of the number of frames between peak ON states,
which correspond to the darkest frame in the squid’s cycle, or low grayscale values. They
present changes in the individual organisms’ flashing periodicity.
Figure 6 is taken from a clip of two squid swimming parallel to one another. For the first
two seconds they are nearly perfectly synchronized, and then within 1.5 periods they switch,
becoming out of phase with respect to one another. Figure 7 is from a clip of two squid
swimming parallel to one another. Remarkably, their flashing frequency shifts in similar ways
so that they remain synchronized for eight cycles. Here, as in figure 8, it is difficult to tell
