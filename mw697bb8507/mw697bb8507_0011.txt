Discussion
The graphs of between-peak-ON intervals show that there can be great variability when
two squid are flashing in clear view of one another (see Figure 8b), or there can be relative
stability (see Figure 7b). The same is true when one squid is flashing on its own (compare
Figures 3b and 5b). However, more data must be gathered in order to refine this hypothesis.
The study of this informationally rich behavior would be greatly aided by documentation
at a higher sampling rate. Specifically, this would help disambiguate variability in periodicity of
flashing. Another goal would be to obtain longer videotaped segments of small groups (2-4) of
squids swimming or hovering near each other. This is a challenge because the animals are free-
swimming; observation in captivity is one possible way of eliminating that problem. Such data
sampling would also allow the study of variability in flashing frequency within one individual
over longer periods of time, as well as giving us insight into possible correlations between
signaling behavior and the individualâ€™s sex. This might give us clues about the adaptive function
of Dosidicus flashing behavior.
As noted earlier, all the theories put forth to explain firefly flashing behavior are built on
the assumption that it promotes mating in some way that makes it adaptive, either for the
individual or the group. The reasons behind this assumption illuminate several differences
between firefly and Dosidicus flashing. In fireflies, there are clear differences in the flashed
signals of the two sexes, and those signals are stereotyped. For a given species, there will be an
unchanging flash frequency or patter of flashing. In the videos of Dosidicus used in this study
included some squid that never flashed, some that flashed for a few seconds and then stopped,
