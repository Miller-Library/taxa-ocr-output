(Hanlon and Messenger, 1988). When the fibers are stimulated, they contract and the
chromatophore expands. The pigment granules create what looks like a tiny spot on the dermis,
a state we will refer to as ON. In D. gigas, when a group of chromatophores are simultaneously
switched ON, the entire area appears reddish-brown because of the red-brown chromatophore
pigment. To colorblind conspecifics (and to us, in blue-shifted light), this state appears simply as
dark. Somewhat counterintuitively, then, the bright flashes occur when the chromatophores are
in the OFF state.
Ã–ther animals exhibit similar flashing behavior, both within the class Cephalopoda and
outside it, notably in the class Insecta. Within Cephalopoda, the binary nature of D. gigas
flashing, as well as its speed distinguishes it from the flashing of other species. Sepia species,
for example, often use their ornate patterning as camouflage and countershading (Messenger,
1988). The best-studied group of flashing insects is the fireflies (genus Pteroptyx and Photinus)
(Buck, 1988). Buck reviews many of the competing theories of the function of firefly flashing,
all of which relate flashing behavior to courtship and mating.
We used image analysis software to examine video clips of D. gigas swimming freely
and on fishing lures. Pairs of individuals appear to synchronize briefly and sporadically with one
another, and to maintain a more constant rhythm when they are isolated.
Materials and Methods
All of the videos used in analysis were filmed off Santa Rosita, BCS in October 2001.
They were made by Bob Cranston, an independent filmmaker, using SCUBA at depths of 2 to 50
