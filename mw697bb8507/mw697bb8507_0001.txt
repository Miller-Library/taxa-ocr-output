Abstract
The jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, exhibits chromatophore-effected flashing
behavior at frequencies of about 3 Hz. In order to characterize this behavior
quantitatively and to make it possible to speculate as to its function, videos of D. gigas in
its natural environment were taken and analyzed. There is great variability in the
consistency of flashing rates among individuals: some stay relatively stable while others
fluctuate widely in short spans of time. Videos of two squid encountering one another
suggested that squid adjust to their conspecifics' flashing patterns in complex ways. A
greater corpus of data will be necessary before specific hypotheses about the function of
D. gigasâ€™ flashing behavior can be formulated.
