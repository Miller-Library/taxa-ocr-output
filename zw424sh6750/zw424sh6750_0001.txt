ABSTRACT
The heat shock response is a universal phenomenon in which an
environmental stressor causes an animal to produce large quantities of heat
shock proteins or HSPs. These proteins are thought to protect the cells from
the damaging effects of stress, allowing the organism to recover from the
shock and survive. In this study, the heat shock response was studied using
the western blotting technique in the benthic sea cucumber, Psolus
squamatus. An initial screening of the proteins from an unshocked specimen
revealed a total of five proteins that cross-react with the anti-heat shock
protein 60 antibody. P. squamatus generally lives in temperatures between
4°C and 7°C and in an ocean water salinity of 33.2 parts per thousand. Heat
shocking the animals along a temperature gradient revealed that heat shock
protein 60 production can be induced at 13°C, but protein synthesis appears to
shut down and protein degradation may occur at super-ambient temperatures
such as 20°C. Death occurs at 22°C. Salinity shock was at 10 g/L above and
below the natural salinity of 33.2 g/L (parts per thousand). Results of the
salinity shock appear a little more ambiguous and further study needs to be
done before any conclusions are drawn.
INTRODUCTION
Heat shock proteins are present in all organisms and serve basic
indispensable cellular functions (see 4, 6, 8 for review). They interact with
other proteins in important ways such as aiding in intracellular trafficking of
proteins and stabilizing proteins such as immunoglobulins. Heat shock
proteins are among the most highly conserved between different species and
therefore are very easy to detect. Their high degree of sequence homology
