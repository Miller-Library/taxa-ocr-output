between the intensity of the protein band and the amount of protein that was
present in the specimen at the time of homogenization.
RESULTS
INITIAL SCREENING FOR HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS: Before the heat shock and
salinity shock experiments were performed, two untreated specimens were
homogenized in order to determine which heat shock proteins are present in
the non-stressed organism. Table 1 (4/8 - 4/20) lists the results of this initial
screening. There are at least two, and possibly three heat shock proteins that
are recognized by the anti-HSP 60 antibody. The molecular weights of the two
more prevalent HSP 60s are about 58 kD and 48 kD based upon the pre-stained
molecular weight marker. The third HSP 60 protein, which appears fainter
than the other two, appears at a molecular weight of about 55 kD. Figure 1
shows a western blot of untreated P. squamatus protein probed with anti-HSP
60. The lane on the left contains twice as much protein as the lane on the
right. The 58 kD and the 48 kD proteins are visible in both lanes. Small
quantities of the 55 kD protein can be seen in the lane on the right.
Screening for HSP 70 proteins was done with three different primary
antibodies, each of which has a small difference in binding affinity. Results
show that there were no HSP 70 proteins present in the untreated organism.
Screening with anti-HSP 90 showed that HSP 90 proteins were absent as well
(see Table 1).
P. SQUAMATUS PRODUCES AT LEAST FIVE HSP 60 PROTEINS: There appears
to be five proteins that vary widely in molecular weight and cross-react with
the anti-HSP 60 antibody. These five proteins can be seen in Figure 2. The
lane on the left shows the three proteins that cross-react with the anti-HSP 60
