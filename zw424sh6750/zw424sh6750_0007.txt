antibody seen in Figure 1. The second lane contains the proteins of a control
P. squamatus in a heat shock experiment that is producing an HSP 60 protein
with a molecular weight of about 116 kD in addition to the three HSP 60
proteins seen in the left lane. The lane on the far right shows the proteins of
a control P. squamatus in a salinity shock experiment that is producing a 40
kD protein that cross-reacts with the anti-HSP 60 antibody. Three of the
proteins that are recognized by anti-HSP 60 (116, 55, 40 KD) appear sporadically
throughout the experiments under different shock conditions and sometimes
not at all. However, the 58 kD and the 48 kD proteins appear in every protein
sample at different concentrations and intensities. The rest of this study
focuses on these two proteins and the relative intensities of these HSP 60
bands as they appear on the western blots.
EFFECT OF HEAT SHOCK ON THE 58 KD AND 48 KD PROTEINS RECOGNIZED BY
ANTI-HSP 60: Figure 3 demonstrates the induction of protein synthesis at
12°C and the shutdown of protein synthesis and possible protein degradation
at 19°C by western blot analysis of the HSP 60 proteins present in P. squamatus
under different temperature shock conditions. The first lane contains the
proteins of the control organism which was kept at 5°C during the heat shock.
The second lane did not run properly. It contained the proteins of the
organism shocked at 8°C. The third and fourth lanes contain the proteins of
organisms shocked at 12°C and 19°C respectively. Equal amounts of protein
were loaded into each of the lanes. Analysis of the darkness of each of the
bands illustrates trends in the relative amount of protein in each shock
condition compared to the control. Heat shock protein induction occurs at
milder heat shock conditions and protein degradation occurs in the more
drastic shocks. Figure 4 contains the quantitative analysis of the intensities of
