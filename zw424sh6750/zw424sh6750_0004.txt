hypertonic (43.2 g/L) solutions of Instant Ocean to the acclimated organism at
5°C for 3 hours. There were two salinity controls. The Instant Ocean control
organism was acclimated at 5°C in a 33.2 g/L solution of Instant Ocean which
was replaced with a new 33.2 g/L solution for the duration of the salinity
shock. The other control was acclimated in normal Deep Sea Lab sea water at
5°C which was replaced with fresh Deep Sea Lab sea water at 5°C for the shock.
The second control was to see whether the Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt
itself elicits a heat shock response.
HOMOGENIZATION: Äfter shocking the organisms, the tentacle tissues were
dissected and placed in 200 ul of homogenization buffer, consisting of PBS,
EDTA, PMSF, pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and NP-40, and ground
using a Teflon homogenizer. The sample was transferred to a 1.5 ml
Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 18,000 x g on a refrigerated microcentrifuge
MTX-150 for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf
tube. Protein content was determined by adding 10 ul of the supernatant to 1
ml of de ionized H20 and 1 ml of Coomassie stain reagent and reading the
sample at 595 nm on a Beckman DU-7 Spectrophotometer. A standard curve
was used to determine the protein content from the spectrophotometer
reading. An equal volume of 2X solubilizing buffer (7) containing DL¬
Dithiothreitol was added to the supernatant and boiled for 3 minutes to
solubilize the protein. Samples were frozen at -20°C.
SDS-PAGE: SDS-PAGE (10 % polyacrylamide) was carried out by Laemmli's
method (5) to separate proteins according to size in reducing conditions.
