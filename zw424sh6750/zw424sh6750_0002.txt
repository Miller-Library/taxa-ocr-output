allows for probing with antibodies made in different organism. The proteins
occur in molecular weight families, of which there are four main types; the
large molecular weight HSPs, the HSP 70 family, the HSP 60 family, and the
small HSPs (15-30 KD). Proteins within each family share common amino
acid sequences and cross react with the same antibody. They can, however,
vary in size, but they generally fall into a narrow size range around which
they are named.
Heat shock proteins are present in the body at lower levels in the
absence of stress. The stress response is characterized by a large scale
induction of these proteins. The proteins are thought to protect the cells from
the damaging effects of stress, allowing the stressed organism to recover and
survive. Various stressors include heat shock, salinity shock, anoxia, pH
variations, and contamination from different chemicals or xenobiotics in the
environment. The stress response is universal.
For this study, the stress response was studied in Psolus squamatus., a
benthic sea cucumber that is found abundantly in the Monterey Canyon. It is
an interesting organism to study because it is found at a very large depth
distribution, ranging from 200 m to 3500 meters deep. The temperature
varies with the depth, with colder temperatures occurring at deeper depths.
P. squamatus is found to survive extreme environmental stresses with a great
amount of success. Its natural habitat is in temperatures ranging between 4째C
to 7째C. When exposed to a temperature gradient that ranged up to 25째C, the
organisms were seen to survive in temperatures up to 22째C.
Early studies of the heat-induced puffs in the fruit fly, Drosophila
busckii, demonstrated that heat shock protein induction tended to interfere
with oxidative phosphorylation or electron transport to protect cells from
respiratory stress (6). A recent study in P. squamatus demonstrated that
