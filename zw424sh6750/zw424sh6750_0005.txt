WESTERN BLOTTING: Western blots were prepared by Burnette's standard
techniques (1). Two different transfer protocols were used, Hybond-ECL and
Immobilon-P Transfer PVDF. The primary antibodies used included rabbit
anti-60kD Heat Shock Protein (SPA-804), mouse anti-72kD HSP (SPA-801),
mouse anti-72/73KD HSP (SPA-802), and mouse anti-90KD HSP (SPA-803),
which were stored at -70°C and were provided by StressGen Biotechnologies
Corporation in Victoria BC, Canada (product numbers in parentheses) and
mouse anti-HSP 70 monoclonal antibody 3A3 that was stored at -20°C and was
provided by Sean Murphy of Northwestern University. Dilutions were as
follows: 1:1000 for anti-HSP 60, 1:10,000 for anti-HSP 70 3A3, 1:500 for anti
D 70
HSr 72, 1:500 for anti-HSP 72/73, 1:300 for anti-HSP 90. Secondary antibodies
included anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Product No. A-4416) and anti¬
rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Prod. No. A-4914) provided by Sigma
Immuno Chemicals in St. Louis, MO and stored at -20°C. Both secondary
antibodies were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. All antibodies were diluted in a
total volume of 2.5 ml. Visualization of antibody binding was done using
the Amersham Life Science ECL Western Blotting detection reagents
RPM2109 and Kodak X-ÖMAT Scientific Imaging Film. Film was developed
in a Konica X-ray film processor QX-60A.
QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS: Protein bands on western blots were analyzed
using Jandel Scientific JAVA Version 3 Video Analysis Software. Eight
intensity readings were taken of background and four intensity readings were
taken of each band of interest. Background readings were averaged and
subtracted from band intensity averages to produce relative intensities of the
heat shock protein bands. It is assumed that there is a direct correlation
