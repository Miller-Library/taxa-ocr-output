that the protein belongs to the HSP 60 protein family. Nevertheless, the fact
that there are a total of five proteins that cross-react with the anti-HSP 60
antibody may give some indication as to why Psolus squamatus has been so
successful at surviving in such a wide variety of environments. The sum of
these proteins may better prepare the organism to survive environmental
changes and stresses, accounting for its abundance and success in the
Monterey Canyon.
In addition to the constitutive HSP 60 proteins that aid the organism in
its survival, this study has also documented a marked increase in the levels
of these same proteins under stress conditions. The heat shock experiments
showed that HSP 60 protein production is amplified under a temperature
shock of about 13째C. However, at super-shock conditions of about 20째C, the
amount of protein present in the animal drops significantly. It appears as if
the organism can respond to the heat shock with the HSP induction response
to a certain threshold temperature. Beyond this point, the organism may be
impaired in its ability to synthesize new proteins. Furthermore, the
constitutive heat shock proteins may also be breaking down at these super-
ambient temperatures. Again, protein degradation was seen at temperatures
of about 20째C and P. squamatus have been seen to survive in temperatures of
up to 22째C. There appears to be a direct correlation between the decrease in
heat shock protein activity and the deaths of the animals, as they occur within
the same general temperature range.
The results of the salinity shock experiments were not as clear cut.
Much more work can be done to continue this project. The salinity and heat
shock experiments can be rerun in gradients with smaller salinity and
temperature increments in order to better predict the trends occurring. Time
course experiments could be run in order to determine at which specific
