FIGURE 1: Western Blot: HSP 60 Proteins Present in Initial Screening of P.
squamatus: The two lanes contain protein from an unshocked P. squamatus.
The left lane contains twice as much protein as the right lane. The blot was
probed with anti-HSP 60 antibody.
FIGURE 2: Western Blot: Five Proteins Cross-React with Anti-HSP 60: The
three lanes contain protein from an unshocked specimen (same as in Figure
1), protein from a control organism in a heat shock experiment, and protein
from a control organism in a salinity shock experiment respectively. The
blots were probed with anti-HSP 60 antibody. The five different proteins that
cross-react with the antibody are marked.
FIGURE 3: Western Blot: HSP 60 Proteins Due to Heat Shock Conditions: The
first three lanes contain protein from organisms shocked for two hours at 5°C
(control), 12°C, and 19°C. The last lane contains the HSP 60 standard. The
blot was probed with anti-HSP 60 antibody.

FIGURE 8: Western Blot: HSP 60 Proteins Due to Salinity Shock Conditions:
The first four lanes contain protein from organisms shocked at 23.2 g/L, 33.2
g/L (instant ocean control), 43.2 g/L, and in normal sea water (normal
control). The HSP 60 standard is in the fifth lane. The blot was probed with
anti-HSP 60 antibody.
