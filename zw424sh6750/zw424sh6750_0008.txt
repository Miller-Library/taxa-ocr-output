the 58 kD and the 48 kD protein bands on the western blot in Figure 3 based
on data from the JAVA image processor. Specific values of the relative
intensities are given in Table 1 (Expt. 5/25/93) under the "HSP 60 (58 kD)" and
the "HSP 60 (48 kD)" columns. The numbers reported are the relative
intensity (intensity of band minus the intensity of the background) values per
ug of protein loaded per lane. In the higher molecular weight protein (58 kD),
there is a dramatic increase in the amount of protein at 12°C and a decrease at
19°C. Levels of the lower molecular weight protein (48 kD) stay relatively
constant in the organism between 5°C and 12°C but decrease at 19°C. It
appears that heat shock protein production is induced during heat shock to
aid the organism in dealing with the stress. However, there is a threshold
temperature beyond which protein synthesis is inhibited and the organism is
unable to manufacture any new proteins.
Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the JAVA image processing analysis of the
other three heat shock experiments that were run. Again, specific values can
be found in Table 1. Figure 5 shows an increase in the amount of both the 58
kD and the 48 kD proteins after a heat shock of 2 hours at 13°C. Figure 6
shows a decrease in the amount of both the 58 kD and the 48 kD proteins after
a heat shock of 2 hours at a super-ambient temperature of 19.6°C. Figure 7
shows a small increase in the amount of the 58 kD protein and a more
significant decrease in the amount of the 48 kD protein present after a shock
at a super-ambient temperature of 20.4C for two hours. The results of these
three experiments serve to support the trend seen in Figures 3 and 4. The
only inconsistency is in the increase of the 58 kD protein after a super-shock,
but the amount of increase is very small and may be an anomaly.
