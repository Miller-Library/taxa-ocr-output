points of the shock protein activity is occurring. The five different proteins
that cross-reacted with the anti-HSP 60 antibody could be isolated, sequenced
and studied in order to determine whether or not each of these proteins are
really HSP 60 proteins. This would be especially interesting to do to the 116
kD protein because it seems to be a previously unidentified heat shock
protein. The proteins could also be separated on two-dimensional gels on the
basis of both size and charge in order to get better resolution of the proteins.
The induction of HSP 60 proteins could be studied at the level of gene
expression by isolating and quantifying RNA during different stages of the
shock. All of these experiments would be useful in better characterizing the
heat shock response in this organism. Learning more about the heat shock
proteins and the biochemical activity occurring in Psolus squamatus may give
important insights into its heartiness, its successful survival in many
different environments, and the reasons for its dominant presence in the
benthic seas.
