respiration increases with temperature between 2°C and 15°C (2). A heat
shock response may be induced in P. squamatus' to aid the organism in
surviving the temperature increase and the possible respiratory stress. The
main goals of this project were to identify the heat shock proteins present
constitutively in the animal and to study the effects of heat shock and salinity
shock on heat shock protein induction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
COLLECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF SPECIMENS: Psolus squamatus used in
this study were collected with the MBARI ROV from various depths in the
Monterey Bay Canyon. They were kept in the Deep Sea Lab of Hopkins
Marine Station at an ambient sea water temperature of 5°C until needed.
INDUCTION OF STRESS RESPONSE:
• Heat Shock: Viable specimens were isolated in individual test tubes or jars
and acclimated in Deep Sea Lab sea water (5°C) for 12-18 hours. Heat shock
was induced by placing the jars containing the acclimated specimens into
water baths previously set to heat shock temperatures. The individuals were
shocked for a total of 2 hours. The control specimens were kept at 5°C for the
duration of the heat shock. Individuals were shocked over a gradient of
temperatures between 5.0 and 25.1°C. Individuals survived to an upper limit
temperature of 22.0°C.
• Salinity Shock: Specimens were isolated in individual jars and acclimated
in a solution of Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt, provided by Aquarium
Systems of Mentor, ÖH, at a concentration of 33.2 parts per thousand (33.2 g
Instant Ocean/1 L de ionized H2O) at 5°C for 12-18 hours. Individuals were
shocked by decanting the 33.2 g/L solution and adding hypotonic (23.2 g/L) or
