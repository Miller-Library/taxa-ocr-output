ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First and foremost, I would like to thank the Levine lab. It got a little crazy at
times, but it was always fun. Thank you to my advisor, Dr. Paul Levine, for
his advice, support, and encouragement throughout my project. Thank you
to Julie Golden for her patience and kindness and to Jan Van Kampen for
letting us invade his lab space. Thanks to my lab mates Theresa, Dan, and
Greg for helping me out in lab, for our Big Mac lunches, our pizza and
Chinese food dinners, and for making this quarter a blast. Thank you to
Chuck Baxter for all of his wise advice and for sharing his enthusiasm.
Thanks to all of Hopkins Marine Station and the spring quarter class. It was
great getting to know everyone. I had a great time and learned a lot. Thanks
for making this the greatest quarter ever!!
