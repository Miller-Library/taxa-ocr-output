control organism (33.2 ppt) to have a dramatically higher amount of both the
58 kD and the 48 kD proteins. However, this result may not be significant
because the water that was removed after the experiment appeared to be
contaminated with some sort of milky substance. This contamination may
have accounted for the increased levels of heat shock proteins in that
particular animal. If the 33.2 ppt control is disregarded, and the shock
conditions are compared to the normal sea water control, it appears as if the
salinity change induces a small increase in the levels of the heat shock
proteins. However, the change is not dramatic enough to be able to draw any
conclusions. This and the contradictory data seen in Figure 10 make it
difficult to predict any conclusive trends.
DISCUSSION
The initial screening to determine which heat shock proteins are
present in Psolus squamatus revealed that there are five proteins that crossÂ¬
react with the anti-HSP 60 antibody. These five proteins are 116 kD, 58 KD, 55
KD, 48 kD, and 40 kD in size and span a molecular weight range of 76 kD. A
heat shock protein family is generally characterized by sequence homology
among its members and specific binding of its members to the same antibody.
The anti-HSP 60 antibody used to probe the blots was polyclonal. This may
have decreased the specificity of the cross-reaction between the antibody and
the proteins on the blots. Of particular interest is the 116 kD protein found in
P. squamatus that cross-reacts to the anti-HSP 60 antibody. This protein
occurs greatly out of the size range of the other anti-HSP 60 binding proteins
and has not been documented before. This binding may be a result of the
polyclonal nature of the primary antibody used and may not necessarily mean
