accompanied by increased metabolic activity, which may in turn have been
related to increased CDDT uptake.
IEVELS OF DDT RESIDUES IN NATURAL POPULATIONS
If DDT is entering Monterey Bay by way of the Salinas River, it can be
expected that the population of sand crabs located near the mouth of the
Salinas River would contain more DDT residues than a population of sand crabs
located at an ocean exposed beach several miles away. In order to test
this hypothesis, the DDT and DDE levels of sand crabs from the Asilomar
Beach and the mouth of the Salinas River were measured and compared.
Samples consisting of 5 sand crabs were allowed to dry on paper towels
for 5 minutes and then weighed to the nearest milligram. The sand crabs were
digested in a glacial acetic acid- perchloric acid mixture for 24 hours, followed
by lipid extraction with nanograde hexane, and lipid removal by passage
through a column of celite and sulfuric acid. The cleaned-up sample was
concentrated if necessary. For details of this procedure see Stanley and
LeFavoure (1965).
The Beckmann GC h chromatograph with a electron capture detector was
used for all experiments. The DDE values were determined using a 3% OF-1
column, and the DDT values were determined using a 10% DC 200 column, both of
which were on DMCS treated Chromosorb 1, 80 to 100 mesh. Conditions during
runs were as follows. Temperatures: inlet 220°0, column 200°C, detector 280°c.
Helium pressure: input 40 psig. Flow rate of helium: 10 ml/min for OF-l and
200 ml/min for DC 200. Column injections were made with Hamilton 10-ul
syringes.
The DDE and DDT content of female Emerita from Asilomar Beach and near
the mouth of the Salinas River are summarized in Fig. 4. There is no
statistically significant difference between the DDE content of the two
Emerita populations. The probability of exceeding the t value of 1.008 is
