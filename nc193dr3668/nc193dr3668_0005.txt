the water or adsorbed to particulate matter is diluted before reaching the
sand crab population.
UPTAKE OF C14-DDT
In order to determine the ability of Emerita to take up DDT directly
from solution in the surrounding water, experiments were carried out using
DDT labled with C+. A 100 ppm (parts per million) solution of CHDDT
dissolved in ethanol, with a specific activity of 19 curies/mole was used
to make up the C+DDT-sea water solutions. All sea water used was filtered
once through an 8u millipore filter and a 3u millipore filter to remove
particles. The filtered sea water was aerated for 5 to 10 minutes before
addition of C+DDT in ethanol. Where different concentrations of C+DDT were
used, additional ethanol was added to insure that each jar contained equal
amounts.
Two types of C-DDT uptake experiments were conducted, both on sand crabs
obtained from Asilomar Beach. (1) Three Emerita were placed in a sealed one
gallon glass jar containing only 2.5 liters of a C-DDT sea water solution.
Sand crabs in these experiments lacked a substratum in which to burrow. They
were not observed continuously for 12 hours, but on every occasion when they
were seen they were either swimming or actively scrambling along the bottom
of the jar. (2) Three Emerita were placed in a sealed one gallon glass jar
with 2.5 liters of a C+DDT sea water solution and in addition a lcm layer
of sand on the bottom which allowed the animals to bury themselves completely,
On all occasions when these sand crabs were observed they were completely
buried with only the antennules protruding above the sand. Sand crabs were
circulating water down the antennular funnel and ejecting it from the branchial
chamber below the sand. The sand crabs were incubated overnight for 12
hours. Both types of experiments were conducted at concentrations of DDT of
O.1, 0.2, O.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 ppb (parts per billion).
