FIGURE CAPTIONS
Fig. 1: Map of Asilomar Beach and the mouth of the Salinas River.
Numbered collecting stations are 50 yards apart. Sand crabs were found only
at dotted stations. The large dot on the graphs of tide movement represent the
period of salinity testing. The vertical axis is height and the horizontal
axis is time. Underlined times indicate A.M.
Fig. 2: Percentages of normal sea water found at collecting stations
at Asilomar Beach and the mouth of the Salinas River. Salinity was
measured at both the surface (T) and belows the surface (B) in the river
channel. Sample number refers to the graphs in Fig. 1 showing the period
of sampling in relation to tidal position.
Fig. 3a,b: DDT uptake by Emerita analoga at various DDT concentrations,
Fig. 3a shows uptake of CDDT by sand crabs burrowed in sand while Fig. 3b
shows CDDT uptake by sand crabs swimming freely in sea water. Each dot
represents one sand crab. The circles in Fig. 3a indicate that CH4ppT
uptake was to close to background levels to calculate. Uptake is expressed
in wet weight of whole Emerita per 12 hours.
Fig. I: DDE and DDT levels expressed in ppb of wet weight of whole
Emerita found in samples consisting of 5 sand crabs from Asilomar Beach and
near the mouth of the Salinas River. The DDT levels of the Asilomer Beach
sand crabs were too low to be measured and the standard deviation could not
be calculated.
