WATER SALINITY AND SAND CRAB DISTRIBUTION
All sand crabs used were non-egg carrying females ranging in wet
weight from 2.5 to 7 grams. They were collected in two areas separated
by about 11 airline miles. One area was  Spanish Bay, just south of Asilomar
State Park, on the open coast. The other area was 100 to 600 yards north of
the mouth of the Salinas River on the shore of Monterey Bay. Collecting
stations are shown in Fig. 1.
Salinity was measured in the field with a refractometer. In the river
channel and mouth water samples were taken from the top 3 inches of water
where total water depth was about 2 feet at the time of sampling. Samples
were gathered at different times at the Salinas beach and river to study the
effects of incoming and outgoing tides on the river flow into the ocean.
At Asilomar Beach (Figs. 1, 2) sand crabs were collected only between
stations L and 5, although sand crabs were found at all stations. Fresh
water seepage is slight and most of it disappears into the sand before reaching
the water. The water washing the beach shows normal sea water salinity.
and sand crabs here are probably well beyond the influence of the Salinas
River.
At the mouth of the Salinas River (Figs. 1, 2) sand crabs were only found
at stations 13 through 18. Emerita used in experiments were collected between
stations 14 and 17. Results obtained (Fig. 2) show that the salinity of
the water washing the beach is affected by the tides. During a rising tide,
the water outside the river channel maintains salinities of 93% to 1002.
At a falling tide, beach salinities are lowered, though the salinity of
the shore water decreases gradually with increasing distance from the mouth
of the river. The population of Emerita living 100 to 600 yards away from the
river mouth is exposed to 25% to 10% river water for six hours every other
six hours or during each falling tide. DDT in the river, either dissolved in
