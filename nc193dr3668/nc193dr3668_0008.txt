However, there is a very clear difference in the DDT content in the two
populations. The DDT content of sand crabs from near the mouth of the
Salinas River was approximately 110 ppb, while the DDT content of the sand
crabs at Asilomar Beach was too low to be measured with the gas chromatograph.
The DDT content of the two populations of sand crabs suggests that the
Emerita from the mouth of the Salinas River are exposed to DDT which is not
present in the sea water at Asilomar Beach. The DDE content of the two
populations are identical and suggests that the DDE concentration in the
water washing the beach is the same.
A possible hypothesis to explain the similarity in DDE level and the
difference in DDT levels of the two populations is as follows. DDT is broken
down by ultraviolet light, and consequently most of the DDT residue present
in the ocean is DDE. However, during the rainy season, DDT reaches the fast
flowing Salinas River and is transported rapidly to the mouth of the river
and into Monterey Bay. The small amount of DDE that has been formed during
the short trip down the river does not effectively alter the concentration of
DIE present in the ocean. However, because the DDT concentration of the ocean
is extremely low, the amount of DDT emptied into Monterey Bay from agricultural
run-off and the flooding of farmland significantly raises the DDT concentration
of the water surrounding the mouth of the river. During low tide, the
population of Emerita near the mouth of the Salinas River are exposed to
both DDT from the river and DDE already present in the ocean. Eventually
all of the DDT reaching the bay is broken down into DDE but this amount is
too small to change the DDE concentration of the ocean. Consequently, the
DDE concentration is the same in the sea water washing the Emerita population
at Asilomar Beach and near the mouth of the Salinas River.
