do not appear to be high enough to produce any harmful effects to the sand
crabs themselves. However, as already noted the Barred Surfperch, Sanderling.
Snowy Plover, Semipalmated Plover, and Sandpiper regularly feed on large
numbers of sand crabs. DDT residues taken in with the sand crabs may be stored
and accumulated in the tissues of these birds and fishes, and studies should
be made to determine whether thse animals are approaching harmful levels
of DDT residues or even already suffering from the effects of high concentrations
of the pesticide.
SUMMARY
The filter feeding sand crab, Emerita analoga, is abundant in sandy
beaches on California shores. It is an important food source for the
Barred Surfperch and several shore birds including the Snowy Plover, Sanderling.
and Sandpiper. Several California birds and fished contain high levels of
DDT and its derivitives. Emerita is in a position to concentrate DDT residues
from water, plankton, and detritus, and pass them on to fishes and birds
through the food chain.
To measure the rate of uptake of DDT from sea water, sand crabs were
exposed to solutions of C+DDT at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4. 0.6. 0.8.
and 1.0 ppb for 12 hours. Sand crabs burrowed in sand took up a constant
amount of DDT in concentrations of 0.l to 1.0 ppb (increases from lOx to 25x).
Sand crabs free in sea water took up amounts of DDT proportional to the DDT
concentration in the sea water (an increase of 55x).
Natural levels of DDT residues were determined by gas liquid chromatography
in populations of sand crabs from the mouth of the Salinas River, which
drains an agricultural valley where DDT use is widespread, and from Asilomar
Beach, an exposed ocean beach several miles away. Approximately 80 ppb of
DDE were found in both populations. Only trace amounts of DDT were present
in sand crabs from Asilomar Beach, while approximately 110 ppb were found in
sand crabs from the mouth of the Salinas River.
