a sandbar usually forms and closes the river mouth.
A population of Emerita analoga, the sand crab, which inhabits the
stretch of beach approximately 100 to 600 yards from the mouth of the river
was chosen for a study of the influence of the Salinas River in the marine
environment.
Emerita burrow in the wash zones of sandy beaches and migrate with the
tides (Cubit, 1968). When the tide rises, Emerita ride incoming waves to
higher positions on the beach. At a falling tide, they are carried by the
back wash waves to lower beach positions. Emerita are exposed directly to
DDT in the water not only during their tidal migrations up and down the beach.
but also when they are burrowed in the sand and circulating water through
the gill chambers.
Emerita are filter feeders and feed on plankton and detritus between
bu and 2mm long (Efford, 1966). Because DDT is readily adsorbed to particles
(Odum et al., 1969) and the Salinas River contains a large amount of organic
material and silt, DDT may be entering the Emerita in the food chain, as
well as possibly by direct uptake.
Mature female Emerita are from 12 to 18 months old (Barnes and Wenner
1968) and would be indirectly exposed to outflow from the Salinas River for
4 to 6 months of the year when the river mouth is open to the sea.
Sand crabs are very abundant in the sandy beaches along the California
coast and constitute a large portion of the diet of several marine organisms.
Over 90% of the food by volume of the Barred Surfperch consists of sand crabs
(Carlisle et al., 1960). Emerita also forms as much as 75% of the diets of
the Western Sandpiper, Semipalmated Plover, Snowy Plover, and Sanderling
(Reeder, 1951). Emerita is thus in a position to concentrate DDT residues from
water, plankton, and detritus, and pass them on to fishes and birds through
the food chain.
