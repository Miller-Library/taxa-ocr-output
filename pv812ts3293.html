an endogenous clock and a sensitivity to light.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
INTRODUCTION
Many authors have shown that light, or lack of it,
causes cercariae to emerge from their host (Giovannola,
1936, Moa, etal., 1949, Glaudel, 1973, and Wagenbach,
1974). Other researchers have proposed that endogenous
rhythms govern cercarial emergence (Luttermoser, 1955.
and McClelland, 1965). In this report I shall argue
that both an endogenous clock and a sensitivity to light
govern cercarial emergence from Battilaria attramentaria.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Battilaria attramentaria were collected from shallow
ponds at Bennett Slough, a branch of the Elkorn Slough,
Monterey Bay, California. Snails were kept alive in
aquaria with fresh flowing sea water; <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ulva expansa : Exact'>Ulva expansa</span> and
"muck" were added as food. The aquaria were tilted so
that the snails could be dry or wet. The aquarium room
was illuminated by a skylight.
Only infected snails that were three centimeters or
longer from apex to canal were used. During the experi¬
ments snails were kept in labeled 30 ml glass vials
with 20 mls of sea water. At the end of each assay
period the sea water was filtered through Whatman No. 1
filter paper disks, employing an aspirater and a Milli-
pore filter. The filter paper disks were dried in a 78° C.
oven and the filtrate was discarded. After drying the
disks were sprayed with.3% ninhydrin in N-butanol.
Dark purple cercariae were then counted under a disecting
microscope.
A 20 watt General Electric F20T12-CW fluorescent
bulb was used to illuminate the snails. The bulb was 7 cm
above the snails. Light intensity at this distance was
254 uW/cm. To prevent escape a " wire screen was
placed on top of the beakers containing snails.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
During dark photoperiods the snails were kept in
complete darkness (less than 1 uW/cm2). A cloth towel
was draped over the beakers with snails, and was in turn
covered by an inverted disection tray. Before each
experiment the snails were acclimated to the beakers
for a period of 36 hours broken into 12 hours dark.
12hours light and 12 hours dark. Snails were not fed
while the experiments were in progress.

RESULTS
Cercarial emergence relative to photoperiod
What is the que for cercarial emergence? In Bennett
Slough the two environmental factors which change the
most are temperature and light intensity. Other conditions
such as tidal height, pH, and salinity do vary from day
to day as does light and temperature. With this clue in
mind I tested the effect of light on emergence by
subjecting 25 snails to 12 hours of light followed by
12 hours of dark (LD 12:12) for three consecutive days.
Figure 20 illustrates that light and cercarial emergence
are correlated. Variation was great but for any given
24 hour period 80% of the snails would release more
cercariae in the light. There is a statistical difference
(p=.95) between the mean emergence in light and the
mean emergence in dark.
When is the maximum release relative to light onset?
This question was addressed by subjecting 10 snails to
an LD 12:12 cycle and checking for cercariae every two
hours with an additional check thirty minutes after light
onset and termination. Five of the ten snails were chosen
because they showed rhythmic releases in the previous
experiment, and five were chosen for their irregular
cercarial releases. Variation was minimal; only once did
one snail show dramatic deviance from the norm. Figures 10
and 1D relate percent of the total release to time and
temperature.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
A similar experiment was performed where 5 snails
were exposed to natural day and night conditions.
Preceding this experiment the snails were placed in a
3 gallon plastic basin with muck and Ulva expansa, and
the water was changed daily. The snails were then left
out side for three days. The results are similar to the
preceding experiment. Most of the cercarial release
occured within the first six hour following light on set.
Water temperaturwas also checked. Figures lA and 1B
relate time and photoperiod to percent of the total
emergence and to tempéerature, Compare 1A and 1B to 10 and 1D,
a ntural and an artificial system. It is clear that lab
results approximate the real world. Therefore I shall
concider the first two experiments to be controls for
future experiments.
Emergence during constant light and constant dark
To determineif light was the sole causal factor
governing emergence I performed two constant environment
experiments. Six snails were kept in constant dark
for 72 hours and cercariae counts were made every 12
hours. Six other snails were kept in constant light for
72 hours and cercariae were counted every 12 hours. If
light is the lone emergence stimulus one would anticipate
a large constant release during constant light. While
72 hours of constant dark should yield little cercarial
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
release for the entire 72 hours. Contrary to expectation,
the rhythmic emergence pattern of the three day LD 12:12
experiment was observed for the first 36 hours of the
constant dark experiment and also for the first 48 hours
of the constant light experiment. Figures 2A and 2B
demonstrate that there is a rhythmic emergence with or
without light. This raises the possibility of an
endogenous clock because all other external stimuli
were controlled.
Emergence following phase shifts.
Thinking that an internal clock and light are both
factors influencing cercarial emergence I designed four
phase shift experiment to determine if an interaction
of the two factors existed. All four trials employed 5
snails, lasted 60 hours, and had cercariae counts made
before and after light onset. All four trials were ran
simultaneously. The first phase shift experiment
advanced dawn feur hours by shortening the preceding
light period. Figure 3A shows that the second set of
emergence peaks follow illumination. The greatest peak
occured, however, between 0830 and 1030. A second
phase advance was done by shortening the preceding dark
period by four hours. Results were similar to those of
the other phase advance experiment:  large emergence
with the onset of light and a large amergence during
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
the normal maximal period, 0830 to 1030, see Figure 3B.
Compare both phase advance experiments, 3A and 3B, to
30 which can be used as a control.
Two phase delay experiments were also done. A
phase delay involves having light onset occuring later
than expected. One delay was accomplished by lengthening
the preceding light period by four hours. The results
in Figure 4A show that fewecercariae were released
during the prime two hours, 0830 to 1030. In the next
two hours, however, while still in the dark, there was
a marked release of cercariae. When the snails were
illuminated the relaase was most pronounced. A second
phase delay was performed by lengthening the preceding
dark period by four hours. The results, Figure 4B, are
similar to the other phase delay where a marked release
occured before illumination but, the largest emergence
occured after illumination. Compare Figures 4A and 4B
to the control depicted in Figure 40. Figure 40 is
the same experiment illustrated in Figures 10 and 30.
Cercarial emergence relative to temperature
The final question that was answered asked if rising
water temperaturecould stimulate emergence. I tested this
hypothesis twice. Cne night I warmed the snails water.,
while they were in darkness, with a warm water bath.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
Water temperatur Dse from 21° to 28° (C). Un heated
controls were also performed. Each experimental and
control group employed 5 snails that had been in the
dark for theee days so that they would release if a
stimulus was provided. In each trial the numbers of
cercariae released per snail were ranked in decreasing
order. The Wilcoxon 2-sample rank test was used to
determine if the experimental group was releasing more
cercariae than the controls. In the first trial the
experimental was statistically different that the control
(p.95), the experimental released less cercariae!
In the second trial the control and the experimental
were not statistically different.
My colleague, John T. Warren (Warren, 1980) has
noted that large cercarial releases can be obtained
at any time if the snails are kept in dark for two days
and then exposed to bright. A 15 watt incandescent bulb
held at a distance of 15 cm will elicit this responce.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
DISCUSSION
The results of the preceding experiments eliminate
changing temperature asa possible que for cercarial
emergence. Results pertaining to light stimulation
and an endogenous clock are less clear cut and require
careful analysis.
The LD 12:12 experiments (Figures 1C and 20) may
be analyzed together. They both demonsrtate a rhythmic
pattern of cercarial emergence; light stimulation, an
endogenous clock, or a combination of these can explain
this phenomenon. Unfortunately none of these possible
causes can be preven or disproven.
The natural conditions experiment and the 28 hour
lab assay can also be grouped. Together they show that
emergence occures soon after illumination. The largest
peak on the natural conditions graph, 1639 to 1739, can
only be explained by that old biological adage "mother
nature is never wrong".
Constant environment experiments are accepted
assays for endogenous clocks. If a behavior is qued
by an external stimulus that behavior will not be
exhibited in the absence of that stimulus. If the
behavior is keyed to an endogenous clock the behavior
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
12
will occur without external stimulus. This was the guiding prin-
ciple behind the constant environment experiments. The
results of the constant light and constant dark
experiments indicate that an endogenous clock is present
because the daily emergence rhythm is observed for the
first 36 hours in both constant conditions. The results
also show that light is important because the endogenous
clock breaks down without a changing photoperiod.
How much control over emergence does light have?
How much control does the endogenous clock have. These
questions can be partially answered by phase shift
experiments. If light is the more important que, one
would expect that in a phase advance experiment the
peak emergence would follow the onset of light with
a smaller peak at the normal emergence time. If the
internal clock is a more controlling factor than light
onset one would expect a smaller peak following light
onset but, the major peak would occur at the normal time.
The second set of emergence peaks on Figures 3A and
3B contain the relevant data to this argument. In
Figure 3A the largest peak is between 0830 and 1030,
the normal time. Thus the endogenous clock is more
important than photo stimulation. In the other phase
advance experiment the main emergence peak occures before
normal dawn (0830): thus light onset is more powerful in
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
determining cercarial emergence than the internal clock.
Although these two phase advance experiments disagree on
which is the more important in governing emergence, they
both indicate that neither is blatantly dominating the
other. Taken together the results suggest that each
factor weighs about evenly after one phase advance,
The logic employed in the theory of phase advance
experiments is the same type of logic used in phase
delay experiments, only reversed. If photostimulation
is more important than the endogenous clock one would
expect a small release at the normal time, or before
light onset, but the main release peak would be following
illumination. If the endogenous clock governs emergence
more than light one would expect the major emergence
peak to be before the delayed light onset, and a smaller
release after light onset.
Both the phase delay experiments demonstrate that
a clock is present because there am cercarial releases
before illumination began. However, botheexperiments
showed their major releases after illumination. These
results as depicted in Figures 4A and 4B indicate that
light controls cercarial emergence more than the
endogenous clock. As with the phase advance experiments,
the evidence shows that both factors are envolved in
determining the time of cercarial release.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
Warren (1980) observed that snails can be induced to
release cercariae at any time of day. I have personally
confirmed this observation, which coincides with the
results of my constant dark experiment. After two days
of darkness the clock breaks down and light becomes the
sole cause of emergence.
CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
CONCLUSION
It becomes clear that light and an endogenous clock
can each cause a cercarial release. The four phase
shift experiments have shown that both an endogenous
clock and a sensitivity to light work together to govern
cercarial emergence rhythmicity. Although three of
the four phase shift experiments have shown that light
governs emergence more than the endogenous clock I can
not be sure that this is the actual case. Mbre prolonged
phase shift experiments could determine this. But
based on two LD 12:12 epperiments, one natural conditions
experiment, two constant environment experiments, and
four phase shift experiments I conclude that the
emergence of this undescribed species of trematode
cercaria from Battilaria attramentaria is governed by
both an endogenous clock and a photo sensitivity working
together in an equalibrium that follows LeChatelier's
principle.
