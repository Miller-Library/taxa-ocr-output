A. Scanning electron micrograph of the dorsal head and arms of the cuttlefish,
Sepia officinalis. The lateral lines containing hair cells can be seen running from the head,
down the arms.
B. A single ciliated hair cell within the lateral line channel.

A. Set-up used in determining the frequency and amplitude ranges for cuttlefish,
Sepia officinalis.
B. Set-up used in the second conditioning experiment, displaying the barrier that
the cuttlefish had to proceed around in order to obtain the food.
Figure 3:
Responses to frequencies between 9 and 10,000 Hz and amplitudes of 8V to
8.2V. Startle responses refer to those reactions that occur during the first burst of sound.
Behavioral responses involve more sophisticated reactions to sound including; rotation or
movement toward the source, fin beating in synchrony with sound pulses, escape
responses, or long term color changes.
Figure 4:
Distribution of responses during conditioning to 180 Hz. Color changes, increased
or synchronous fin beating, rotation or movement toward the tube and assumption of the
attention position, with two tentacles raised, were all considered behavioral responses to
the sound pulses. Rotation or movement toward the tube and raising of the tentacles are
the clearest indicators that an association between sound and the presentation of food has
been made.

The percentage of trials in which particular behavioral responses to 180 Hz sound
pulses were observed.
