animals. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the cuttlefish to control such blatant
responses, increasing their own chance of obtaining the prey. A single animal in a tank
would be a useful control in answering such a question.
The goal of the final experiment was to determine whether cuttlefish could master a
task demanding higher learning capabilities which required sound discrimination.
Proficiency in completing the task required a level of cognition beyond the simple
association between sound and food displayed in the previous experiment. For successful
execution of the task, the cuttlefish had to make the connection between sound, food, and
movement around the barrier. As seen in Figure 6, motivation, defined as the desire to
obtain food either by procession around the barrier before or after crab presentation or by
waiting for the crab to escape, remained fairly constant throughout the experiment. This is
important in showing that, although the interest was present at the start of the experiment.
fourteen trials were required before the cuttlefish learned to successfully complete the task.
The relatively high number of successful responses after trial fourteen signifies a clear
ability to leam a complex task while making the association between sound and food.
Thus, the questions posed at the start of the investigation were answered.
Cuttlefish can hear within a wide range of frequencies, displaying particular sensitivity to
low amplitude, low frequency sounds. In addition, cuttlefish possess the ability to leam a
complex task through association of sound with a reward.
