Acknowledgments:
T am grateful to Dr. William Gilly, Professor of Neurobiology at Hopkins Marine Station,
for being supportive throughout the project, for calming my frustrations, and for being an
inspiration as a creative research scientist. My thanks, also, to Dr. Thomas Preuss for his
enduring enthusiasm for the project, constant support, and numerous trips to the hardware store.
In addition, I would like to thank Dr. Jim Watanabe for use of his hydrophone and for his undying
dedication to our class as a whole, Dr. Mark Denny for his help in coming up with creative
solutions for an underwater sound device, John Lee for his electrical expertise in building the
sound devise, and the Weissmann lab for our use of their tanks.
