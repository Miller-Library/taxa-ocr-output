Sodium is known to be important in nervous propagation in many systems, and
its absence is an obvious possible explanation for the anaesthetic effect
observed. Tris may also have other, more subtle neuropharacological effects
of course.
Calcium is another cation known to be important in both nervous and
muscular electrical activity and impulse propagation (Hagiwara & Byerly,
1981). Figure 1 displays the relationship between the percent of the 20
stimulated individuals in the colony under study which showed pharyngeal
contraction in response to stimulation vs. time at various concentrations
of calcium in the presence of 450 mM Tris. The results of Figure 1
indicate that anaesthesia is most rapid in Tris-O Ca, showing that Ca ions
in the solution must retard or inhibit the anaesthetic action of Tris.
These results suggest that calcium is important at some point in the
reflex pathway from tentacle stimulation to mantle smooth muscle contraction.
A possible site of calcium's action might be directly on the smooth muscle
mediating contraction, as extracellular calcium is of prime importance in
activating smooth muscle contraction in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis
(personal communication from Ms. Gabrielle Nevitt, Hopkins Marine Station).
All synaptic transmission would also likely be blocked in such a O Ca
solution (Katz & Miledi, 1967).
Observations on recovery time after washing out Tris showed a similar
effect. Recovery following Tris-O Ca followed a much slower time course
than with either 25 mM or 50 mM Ca. This possibly represents the time
necessary for the displaced calcium to return to the tissues, where it
becomes important for smooth muscle contraction and/or nervous transmission.
