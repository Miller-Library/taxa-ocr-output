all cases with tetracaine, although recovery may have been transiently
complete (e.g. Fig. 4c), the individuals were compressed and constricted and
ultimately died. Of the three local anaesthetics tested, only procaine
appears to be completely reversible.
Varying the concentration of procaine over a narrow range caused great
deviation in anaesthetic responsiveness. Figure 5 shows the time courses
for disappearance and recovery of pharyngeal contraction in Botrylloides to
three concentrations of procaine between 100 - 200 uM. Over this narrow
range, the time until anaesthesia varied by forty minutes, with the lowest
concentration showing the longest time course. The reversal time course
after a standard sixty minute exposure showed a similar trend, with the
lowest concentration recovering more rapidly than the other two.
Recovery time was also found to be a function of exposure period length.
Colonies were exposed to lmM procaine for varying periods, and recovery
time course data was gathered and plotted. Figure 6 shows the recovery
time course following washing in fresh sea water (at time zero) after the
indicated exposure periods. In the low range of exposure times, small difÂ¬
ferences in exposure time made large differences in recovery rates (compare
15 min., 30 min., and 1 hr.). The recovery time course for two, three, and
four hour exposures are all similar. This seems to indicate that procaine's
maximum pharmacological effect was reached at approximately two hours exposure,
and additional exposure length changes recovery time very little.
A dosage-response curve for procaine's effects was constructed by
exposing colonies of Botrylloides to various concentrations of procaine for
a standard sixty minute period. The "threshhold" dose below which all
