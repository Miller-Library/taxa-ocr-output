every individual. At this point, the sea water was replaced by the the
appropriate anaesthetic solution. Immediately, the colony was examined for
pharyngeal contractile activity by mechanically stimulating the tentacles,
accomplished by gently circling the inner lip of the oral siphon with the pin.
This operation was performed on twenty individuals in the colony on a
regular schedule of either every five or ten minutes.
After the appropriate exposure time, the anaesthetic was removed by
pouring out the solution surrounding the colony and refilling the dissecting
bowl with fresh sea water. The bowl was filled twice and dumped out, in
order to more thoroughly wash the colony. The same data collection proÂ¬
cedure was used on this recovery phase of the experiment.
The Tris solutions were prepared daily by using a combination of Trizma
HCl and Trizma Base (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) in the correct
proportions to create a 450 mM solution with a pH of 8.0. MgCl, and Cacl,
were added to the Tris solutions from 1M stock solutions (see also Results).
Procaine, dibucaine, and tetracaine (Sigma Chemical) solutions were prepared
by adding the local anaesthetic directly to fresh sea water. These solutions
were used immediately.
Results and Discussion
Tris Studies.
450 mM Tris chloride with no addition of Caclor MgCl, was found to
have a potent anaesthetic effect on tunicates. None of the monovalent cations
normally present in sea water were present in the Tris solution. The
mechanism of Tris anaesthesia is unknown but two possibilities are likely.
