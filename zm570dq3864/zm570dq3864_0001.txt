Summary
The compound ascidian Botrylloides sp. was anaesthetized through
the application of two types of substances. An isotonic solution of
Tris chloride was found to be an effective anaesthetic. The addition
of various concentrations of the divalent cations magnesium and
calcium altered its action. Addition of calcium caused a slowing of
this action, while addition of magnesium accelerated the process.
Three local anaesthetics, procaine, dibucaine, and tetracaine were
testedfor anaesthetic effectiveness on Botrylloides. All three paralyzed
the animals, but only procaine was found to be useful as a reversible
anaesthetic. Full recovery times were obtained for various exposure
periods to procaine and a dosage-response curve for both anaesthesia and
reversal were constructed.
Introduction
Anaesthetizing ascidians has been a problem in working with them
because of the large time lag between application of the anaesthetic and
final complete narcotization. Classical anaesthetics include magnesium
chloride, magnesium sulfate, and menthol (Personal communication from
D. P. Abbott, Hopkins Marine Station), and all of these are subject to
the above criticism. The actual literature on ascidian anaesthesia is
severely lacking, being limited to little more than isolated, brief
observations in various studies concerned with other aspects of ascidians.
I describe here two new methods for tunicate narcotization involving
manipulation of the cationic composition of sea water and application of
local anaesthetics. Both methods are very useful in that they quickly
