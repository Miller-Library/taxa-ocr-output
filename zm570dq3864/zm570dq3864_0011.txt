Figure 1: Time course of pharyngeal contraction response in Botrylloides
exposed to 450 mM Tris, pH 8.0 with varying amounts of calcium. Decreased
calcium correlated with faster anaesthesia time.
Figure 2: Time course of pharyngeal contraction response in Ascidia
ceratodes in response to 450 mM Tris, pH 8.0 with varying amounts of
calcium. Decreased calcium correlated with faster anaesthetic time.
Figure 3: Time course of pharyngeal contraction response in Botrylloides
in response to 450 mM Tris, pH 8.0 with varying amounts of magnesium.
Decreased magnesium correlated with greater anaesthetic time, suggesting
competitive inhibition of magnesium for calcium.
Figure 4: Comparitive study of procaine, dibucaine, and tetracaine at
various concentration levels. Anaesthetics were applied at zero time
(SW4A) and washed out at various times later (SW arrow). a) ImM. Anaes-
thetic response immediate for all three substances, only procaine reversible.
b) 100 uM. Anaesthetic response less immediate for procaine. Dibucaine and
tetracaine irreversible. c) 10 uM. Procaine ineffective at this dosage.
Dibucaine and tetracaine ultimately lethal. d) 1 uM. All three
anaesthetics ineffective at this dosage, tetracaine lethal.
Figure 5: Procaine critical range dosage response. Slight decrease in
procaine dosage causes extension of time needed to full anaesthesia. Recovery
time also depends on procaine dose.
