immobilize the animal, allowing for dissection or other manipulation.
Further, narcotization is easily reversible upon application of fresh
sea water if a conscious animal is again required.
Materials and Methods
The ascidian Botrylloides sp. was obtained from the fouling community
in Monterey Harbor and transferred to five cm by eight om glass slides
for easier handling. This was accomplished by removing a colony of animals
from its natural substrate and after removing as much extraneous tunic as
possible, attaching the animals to the slide by tying them on with thread.
Approximately five days later, after the ascidians had attached to the
glass, the thread was cut to allow further growth and budding. These
colonies were kept in a slide tray under slowly running sea water, and would
remain healthy in this form for at least five weeks.
The tentacles in the oral siphons of these animals were found to be
very sensitive, causing a contraction of the entire pharyngeal region when
mechanically stimulated. This response, thought to be a natural ejection
mechanism (Hecht, 1918) to rid these filtering animals of oversized bits
of detritis, served as a good indication of the irritability of the animal
to tactile stimuli. Thus, the oral tentacles of the animals were stimulated
with a small, stainless steel pin, and the response was either easily
visible or absent.
While in a dissecting bowl, the colonies were examined by observation
under a dissecting microscope throughout the experiment. Before exposure to
the anaesthetic, the animals were examined to confirm that the colony was
healthy and that the normal pharyngeal contraction mechanism was present in
