Figure 6: Recovery time course following varying times of exposure to
1 mM procaine concentration. Increasing exposure causes increase in time
needed until full recovery. Further exposure after 2 hours couses little
change in recovery time.
Figure 7: Dosage response curve. Semi-log plot of Botrylloides colonies
exposed to varying concentrations of procaine for 60 minutes. Left
ordinate is drawn at threshhold dosage, right ordinate is drawn at lethal
dosage. Increasing concentration causes decreased time to anaesthesia and
increased recovery time.
