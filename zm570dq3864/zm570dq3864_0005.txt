Figure 2 represents a similar but more detailed study on the solitary
tunicate, Ascidia ceratodes. More concentrations of calcium were studied,
but the sample sizes (i.e., number of animals) are considerably smaller,
varying from three to five in each concentration. The data in Figure 2
indicate a trend similar to that of Figure 1. The final level of recovery,
however, also appears to be a graded function of calcium concentration.
Figure 3 and all subsequent figures are again for Botrylloides.
Figure 3 represents a study similar to that in Figure 1, but for Tris-Mg
solutions rather than Tris-Ca. In this case, anaesthetization in lower
concentrations of the divalent Mg cation follows a slower time course than
in the higher concentrations. This is ascribed to be due to a competitive
inhibition-type interaction between magnesium and calcium, though conclusive
proof is not available. Mg is known to show such inhibition of calcium's
involvement in synaptic transmission, for example (Ross & Stuart, 1978).
A discrepency between the time courses for 450 Tris-O Ca in Figure 1 and
450 Tris-O Mg in Figure 3 can be seen upon close examination. Though they
were performed at different times, both the Ca study and Mg study employed
precisely the same solutions for all three concentrations, varying only in
the amount of Cacl, or MgCl, added. Further, all three data sets for each
cation were obtained simultaneously. To settle this point, a control
study was run using three colonies of Botrylloides and a 450 mM Tris-O Ca
solution. Data from the three colonies were very similar, and followed
a time course intermediate to the O Mg and 0 Ca study. Thus, while data
from Figure 1 may not be strictly comparable to that of Figure 3, the
comparisons within graphs are justifiably so.
Finally, the animals, while anaesthetized with Tris, were severely
