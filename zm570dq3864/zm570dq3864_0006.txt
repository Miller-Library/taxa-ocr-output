insulted by poking a sharp steel probe through the wall of the pharynx
and lifting upward to create a large rip in the pharynx. The animals
failed to respond,and this was interpreted as a good indication that a
true stateof anaesthesia had been reached. Although animals exposed to
Tris solutions were found to recover fully, while they were anaesthetized
the colonies often appeared somewhat shrunken and compressed, and many of
the oral siphons were partially or completely closed. Also, blood flow
through the colony was substantially slowed, and the colony generally had
an unhealthy appearance.
Local Anaesthetic Studies
Three local anaesthetics were also tested for anaesthetic effectiveness.
Figure 4 shows a compilation of results for procaine, dibucaine, and
tetracaine at dosages varying by a factor of 1000. Figure 4a shows an
immediate response caused by all three anaesthetics at 1 mM concentration
(SW+A arrow). However, upon washing after thirty minutes exposure (SW
arrow), only those individuals exposed to procaine recovered fully. Figure
Ab (100 uM anaesthetic) shows a much slower anaesthetic response by those
individuals exposed to procaine compared to those exposed to tetracaine and
dibucaine. Again, only the procaine sample recovered. Figure lc (10 uM)
shows no response to procaine, but still a fairly rapid reaction to dibucaine
and tetracaine. However, dibucaine and tetracaine were irreversible at
this dosage and exposure time. Figure hd (1 uM) shows no responsiveness to
any of the three drugs. The 50% anaesthetized point at four hours for
tetracaine actually represents lethality for these individuals at that
time. Other tetracaine dosages displayed similar lethal activity. In
