members of the colony did not become completely narcotized was 100 uM.
At 75 uM, the colony did not become narcotized even after three hour exposure.
However, at this dosage, certain individuals would be unresponsive at a
certain time, but responsive at a later time while still exposed to the
procaine solution. This did not represent an anaesthetized state, as defined
by this study. As procaine concentration increased above 100 uM, the time
before the entire colony was completely anaesthetized decreased sharply, as
indicated by the circles in Figure 7. Essentially, immediate action of
procaine was reached by the 1mM point.
Recovery time vs. concentration is also plotted in Figure 7 (triangles).
The recovery points of zero at 75 and 50 uM represent dosages which were
not effective. As concentration increased from these points, recovery
time also increased until a concentration of 2 mM, where the colony did not
recover after a five hour washing in sea water. All dosages at this level
and above were deemed lethal.
Individuals anaesthetized with procaine in the nonlethal concentration
range maintained ciliary pumping throughout their exposure. Upon gross
examination, heart rate did not appear to be affected. Thus, except for
the apparent absence of sensory or motor nerve activity and smooth muscle
responsiveness, the animals seemed viable and healthy. This is also
supported by the ready reversibility of procaine.
Finally, animals exposed to procaine could be preserved in 3% formalin
in sea water and maintain their living, filtering appearance, whereas those
not anaesthetized prior to preservation would undergo fairly violent
pharyngeal contraction and thus appear distorted and substantially different
