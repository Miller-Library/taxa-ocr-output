Materials and Methods
A. Collection: Cirolana harfordi were obtained from three
sources: Macrocystis holdfasts, under rocks in the intertidal,
and from baited traps. The collection area was the Great Tide
Pool in Point Pinos, Pacific Grove, California.
Animals frommthe holdfasts were chosen as the original
population. However, the age structure and sex ratio of this
population limited its usefulness. Brooding females do not
generally eat.(Johnson,1973) and were not desired for the
experiment. I have, however observed them to eat in the lab¬
oratory. The holdfast population had too great a concentration
of brooding females and specimens under five millimeters in
length to provide enough large males for the experiment. Ani¬
mals overrseven point five millimeteres long were selected to
facillitate dissections. Traps set were baited with squid
according to the method of Johnson (1973) and were success¬
ful in attracting about three-fourths large, and hungry males.
This was important because eighty males from the hold¬
fast refused food even after twelve days in a holding tank
with no access to food, except through possible cannabilism.
Many of these males had bright red pieces of annelid persist-
ing in their guts during this twelve day period.
B Methods: Since the red color produced a rough assay for
food in the hindgut, it was decided to feed the animals dyed
food. Squid was soaked for twelve hours and macerated slight-
ly in the vital dye Methylene blue. Obviously Ovigerous fe¬
males were discarded and the remainder of the animals from
