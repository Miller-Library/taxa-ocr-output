Cirolana to be used in the lipid extraction were quick
frozen in plastic bags immersed in a dry ice and ethanol bath.
After one to two minutes the frozen animals were transferred
to a zero?C freezer, and maintained there no more than two weeks
untilanalysis. They were then defrosted at room temperature
and dried to a constant weight in a 50°0 oven.
Dissections were performed by two methods. If the gut
diverticula were to be squashed and examined microscopic¬
ally to determine the presence and condition of food and fat,
the technique was as follows. The animal was placed ventral
side down and its head was slit in a downward motion by slicing
from the fusion of the cephalothorax to just below the eyes.
This piece of exoskeleton wasrremoved, and a small horizontal
cut at the midline was made through the second thoracic seg¬
ment to loosen the layer of connective tissue. The entire
gut was then drawn out with a pair of fine forceps. This
method is ideal for removing whole guts because it allows
the maintainence of relative proportions and positions of
different areas of the gut, and avoids bringing away the lay-
ers of invaginated exoskeleton surrounding the hind and fore-
guts. Squashes were made with distilled water, but when a
whole section of a gut, as, for example, one digestive
lobe ,was to be examined whole it was bathed in fluid from
the isopod's own gut.
The remaining two specimens in each sample were dissect-
ed by placing the animal on its ventral side, cutting through
the midline of the uropod and slitting the dorsal surface to
one side of the midline with a scalpel inserted through the
