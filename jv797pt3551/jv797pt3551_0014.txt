Discussion
During a period of food deprivation in previously gorged
Cirolana harfordi, a slow process of digestion occurs in which
food held in the hindgut is eventually digested. Within the
hindgut large pieces of food are gradually broken into smaller
food masses.in a fluid medium. Movements observed in the di¬
gestive diverticula may represent a means by which fluid pro¬
duced in their lumen is passed into the hindgut. It is prob¬
able that this fluid is related to the observed breakdown of
large masses of food in the hindgut; no fluid was observed
in the hindgut lumen when the hindgut was empty of food par¬
ticles. As digestion progresses the hindgut empties and its
diameter gradually decreases. The most posterior portions
of the hindgut are seen to empty first, and the tissue of
the emptied areas is clear with no blue color.
The diverticula always contain fat droplets. Some food
particles were found in the anterior hindguts of animals de¬
prived of food for twenty-three days. Overall lipid composition
never returned to unfed levels. This shows that Cirolana de¬
prived of food for twenty-three days are not in a state of
tarvation.
A temporal co-incidence of food decrease in the hindgut
with an increase in overall lipid content may be an indication
that lipids are stored and/or synthesized either over their
rate of use as a metabolic substrate or that other products
of digestion are preferentially utilised on a short term basis.
The regurgitation observed shows the existance of a mechan¬
ism by which partially digested food could be moved anteri¬
orly to the hepatopancreatic gland, a site of digestion
