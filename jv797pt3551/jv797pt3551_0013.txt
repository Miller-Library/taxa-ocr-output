7. The diverticula: As noted above Cirolana has three pairs
of sac-like diverticula, the third pair of which I have ob¬
served to be one half to two thirds the length of the first
two pairs. Various observations were made on the changes
in position relative to the hindgut, the other diverticula
and the foregut of the animal. This variance did not appear
to be a function of time; it would seem that the diverticula
often move actively. These, changes are schematically shown
in figure 3. (legend explained in figure captions).
Squashes made of diverticula during the course of the
experiment revealed patches of blue cells scattered in one
70
or all of the diverticula of approximately 5% of the speci¬
mens examined. Evidently, some of the squid, at least,
made its way into the lumen of the hepatopancreatic lobes.
C Lipid content: The percentage values, (from obtained val¬
ues of mg. lipid per mg. dry body weight) are expressed in
figure 4. The values never returned to the value obtained
for unfed animals. After a twenty-three day period of food
deprivation, fed animals were still not starved.
