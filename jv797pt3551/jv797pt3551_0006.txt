all three sources were allowed to feed in the dark for twen¬
ty-four hours. Cirolana is a nocturnally active species.
The fed organisms were subsequently placed in individual
sequestration chambers which allowed the passage of aerated
sea water but prevented the Cirolana from swimming freely.
The chambers were screened to prevent them from eating each
other's molts and to discourage any possible cannabilism.
Molts were removed as they occured. Live births and their
mothers were also removed, as were dead animals.
The sampling regime carried out over the twenty-three
day period of food deprivation included the removal of ani¬
mals for dissections and for composition analysis. At a stage
where the dissections showed great asynchrony more than the
minimal number of five organisms were examined.
