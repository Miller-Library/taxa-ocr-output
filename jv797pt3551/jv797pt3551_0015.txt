and absorption. The presence of small patches of blue cells
in an irregular arrangement within diverticulum, and the ob¬
served small pieces of food within the short midgut tend to
support this scheme.
A period of slow digestion would seem to be an adaptative
advantage for Cirolana in that a decreased feeding frequency
is paralleled by a decreased need for exposure to predators.
Summary
During a 23 day period after feeding with dyed food,
gut contents and morphology of C. harfordi were monitored.
Food in the hindgut,in changing volumes of fluid, was broken
down into small pieces and eventually digested. The midgut
gland showed a continualspresence of fat droplets and fluids
and contained patches of the dyed food cells. The dye used
did not stain the tissue of the hindgut which became clear as
the hindgut emptied. The gut diameter increased after feed¬
ing and gradually narrowed. Changes in the relative positions
of the diverticula were noted.
Overall lipid contents increased sharply with feeding and
remained at higher levels than those in non-fed animals through¬
out the period, indicating that starvation was not occuring.
