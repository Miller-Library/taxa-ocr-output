regained its transparent, prefeed appearance. The digestive
tract is still stained a deep blue. The diverticula all
contain fat droplets. See figure 2.
5. Between week 1 and week 2; Viewed morphologically, the
rate of change for several parameters has begun to accelerate.
The gut is narrower than in 4 (above) and external swelling
is less visible. The posterior portion of the hindgut is
transparent, and the food masses at the anterior end of the
hindgut are smaller than at the previous stages. The lumen
of the posterior portion of the hindgut contains very little
fluid; the whole hindgut region only occupies about 50% of
the body cavity. The amount of blue liquid in the foregut
is still increasing. Diverticula still contained fat drop¬
lets, and the lumen were seen to contain a blue liquid in
the blind end. For two days at some stage between week 1
and week 2 animals began to acquire a light blue tinge that
was not confined to the gut region, after this tinge dissap¬
peared the dye in the gut remained light. See figure 2.
6. Between week 2 and 23 days; the rate of change is not as
5% of
rapid as in 5 (above) but the processes continue. In
the animals examined the hindguts were emptied of food and
fluid. The remaining 66% of the C. harfordi examined had
small food masses at the anterior extremes of the hindgut,
and within the short midgut region. The foregut still con-
tained blue fluid in these 66% of the sample, and small a¬
mounts of blue color were visible in the mid and foregut re¬
gions. All the diverticula contained fat droplets. See figure 2.
