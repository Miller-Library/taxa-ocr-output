parts until the entire cephalon was up to 4mm. deep and the
telson protruded vertically. The animals gorged for from
2-5 minutes. Cirolana with guts that did not appear trans-
parent were not observed to feed; it is assumed that these
isopods do not feed if their hindgut is fairly full.

The results presented here
B. Dissections and Squashes:
represent the averages of the two dissections and three to
six whole gut removals for each time interval. The most
prominent morphological landmarks for the stages of gut ap-
pearance are generalized. Thus the changes observed over a
period of time do not represent strict and discrete changes,
but rather a continuum ofechanges in the means of whole groups
of animals. The drawings in Fig.2 represent this series of
changes for two parameters: the diameters of the hindgut and
the positions of the dyed food within the hindgut (legend
explained in figure captions).
1. Control dissections; these animals were not necessarily
starved, but six of them had empty hindguts. The hindgut
tissue was translucent and colorless, there was no fluid in
the lumen. Three specimens contained recognizable pieces of
annelid worms or setae in the hindgut, which was filled with
clear fluid. The diverticula of all specimens, including a
brooding female, contained greenish brown fat droplets that
appeared to spiral around the lumen.
2. Immediately post feed to 48 hours: there are marked simÂ¬
