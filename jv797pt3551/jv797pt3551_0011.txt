ilarities in many of the characteristics ofthese time stages.
The hindgut is filled with a clear fluid, especially after
36 hours. By 48 hours the amount of fluid has increased so
that the food mass no longer appears to occupy more than 80%
of the body cavity. By 48 hours the food mass no longer con¬
forms in outline to the outline of the gut. Although it is
still regurgitated as one mass, it has narrowed considerably
in some areas. The diverticula contain fat droplets at all
these stages. Changes in gut diameter and in the position
of the dyed food in the hindgut are recorded in figure 2.
3. Between 48 and 72 hours; the amount of clear fluid in
the hindgut steadily increases and the foregut contains a
blue liquid. The food mass in the hindgut has continued to
narrow in places and may have an hourglass appearance. Re¬
gurgitation was induced in three individuals;the connections
between some areas of the food mass were quite tenuous. Two
of the Cirolana regurgitated pieces of squid with intact
chromatores. As in the earlier dissections, the food in the
hindgut was still recognizable as squid. See figure2.
Allthe diverticula contain fat droplets around the lumen.
4. Between 72 hours and 1 week; the gut is less swollen,
anterior and posterior regions of the hindgut are easily dis¬
tinguishable. There is proportionately more of the clear
fluid in the hindgut, which is smaller. The foregut still
contains blue liquid. The food mass in the gut is now in
discrete pieces, and the posterior portion of the gut has
