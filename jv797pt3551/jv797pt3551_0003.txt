The carnivorous isopod Eurydice may store large quan¬
tities of food in its hindgut, where processes of digestion
may be begun, and digest and absorb food in the midgut gland.
(Jones,1968)
It is also possible that the animal survives a period
without feeding by using a dynamic supply of metabolic re¬
serves. Several forms of metabolic reserves might be pos¬
sible storage substrates in such a case.
Steeves((1963) monitored the changes in glycogen con¬
tent during starvation in the isopod Lirceus brachyurus, and
found that it was being used as a metabolic storage product.
The crustacean hepatopancreas (midgut gland) is a site
of both lipid biosynthesis and storage; O'Connor and Gil¬
bert (1968, 1968) have correlated fluctuations in this lip¬
id content with cycles of ecdysis.
Vonk (1960) and others have shown that the dissappear-
ance of proteins from the hepatopancreas during molting is
coupled with tissue growth, and that proteins accumulate
in the hepatopancreas between molts.
These alternative stategies are not mutually exclusive
and any of them might be coupled with a long process of slow
digestion and low energy requirements. I have observed that
in the laboratorycCirolana are markedly less active after
feeding. I felt that any overall analysis of lipid con¬
tents should be paralleled by a morphological study that
would attempt over time to trace the fate of ingested food
within the digestive system.
