Introduction
The intertidal isopod Ci
rolana harfordi (Lockington,1877)
is knowi to feed heavily at discrete intervals and to appar-
ently "fast" in the interim period of up to one month. (John¬
son,1973). Cirolana has been observed by the author to prey
upon small annelids, although it is perhaps best described
as an opportunistic carnivore.
Some preliminary dissections revealed the presence of
large amounts of fat in Cirolana, particularly in the form
of droplets or globules in the digestive diverticula of the
midgut region. This accumulation of lipids, in an area of
endodermal origin, suggested a mechanism whereby the animal
could deplete special metabolic reserves to survive long
periods of time with no feeding. To explore this, I decided
to examine the morphology and contents of the digestive tract
in Cirolana during a period of food deprivation, and to coup¬
le this with a study of the animal's overall levels of li¬
pid content during the same period.
Sequential changes in the amounts of food and fåv in the
gut, as well as a series of extracted lipids were measured,
with the hope of elucidating some of the processes which oc¬

There are several alternative survival strategies which
an animal might employ over periods of food deprivation. It
is possible for food to remain in an undigested state in some
area of the gut and to be recalled at intervals to a site
where digestion and absorption occur.
