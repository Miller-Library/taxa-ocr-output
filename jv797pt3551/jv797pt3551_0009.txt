Figure 1 presents the digestive tract of Cirolana har-
fordi (legend explained in figure captions). The gut ex¬
tends from the esophagus to the anus located on the second
pleopod of the uropod. Except for the short midgut with its
six long diverticula, the entire digestive tract is of ecto¬
dermal origin and is lined with a chitinized invagination
of the exoskeleton (Jones, 1968). The lumen of the sac-like
diverticula empty into the foregut and contain only liquid
or fine particulate matter.(Jones, 1968). The diverticula
are visibly muscularized. The hindgut is quite extensible
but always remains narrowed at its most posterior end. Along
the length of one hindgut there may be considerable variation
in diameter, with the widest area 4-6 mm. anterior to the
anus. The jointure of the midgut and the hindgut is also
sibly narrowed, at least in a distended gut. In an empt
gut the diameter is more constant, because of the collapsed
appearance of the hindgut, the lumen of which is folded in
on itself. The third, posterior pair of caceum are the shortest.
Feeding visibly distends the hindgut;
A. Feeding Behavior:
the animals appear bloated when viewed dorsally. When filled
with dyed material the digestive tract shows blue; however.
there was no clear outline of the diverticula. Ten Cirolana
placed in an aqueous solution of methylene blue did not stain
in the gut region. Observed feeding in five large males
(over 13mm.) involved boring into the meat with the mouth¬
