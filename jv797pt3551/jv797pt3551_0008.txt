cut in the uropod and moved anteriorly through the cut.
The two halves of the exoskeleton were then removed, along
with the underlying layers of connective tissue, exposing
the digestive tract.
The procedure for extracting lipids was suggested to
me by Dr. Phillips (1973). It consisted of soaking intact,
irofana twenty-four hours in 10milliliters acetone
dried C
per animal in sample, grinding samples in fresh acetone in
a tissue grinder, centrifuging in fresh acetone, and resusÂ¬
pending and centrifuging in fresh acetone. Each change used
10 milliliters acetone per animal. The pooled acetone for
each sample was evaporated to dryness over a steambath and
washed four times with 5 milliliters chloroform per animal
to extract the residues. The chloroform was evaporated
over a steambath to a volume of approximately 20 milliliters.
This was poured off into preweighed test tubes and evap
ated to dryness.
