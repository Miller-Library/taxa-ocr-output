Subtidal Tegula distributions
Introduction
Three species of archaeogastropod trochid snails in the
genus Tegula are abundant in subtidal kelp forests near Monterey:
Tegula brunnea, T. pulligo, and T. montereyi (Abbott and
Haderlie, 1980). They are closely related, but exhibit a
bathymetric zonation: T. pulligo is most prevalent between 7-
12m, T. brunnea occurs from the low intertidal zone to about 6
meters subtidally, and T. montereyi is less abundant, and
relatively evenly distributed between 2m and 12m subtidally
(Lowry et al., 1974; Riedman et al., 1981)
Tegula spp. are the most abundant grazer on the giant kelp
Macrocystis pyrifera (Lowry et al., 1974), and are an important
grazer on benthic algae (Schmitt, 1996). Pisaster giganteus and
Pycnopodia helianthoides, two species of sea star, are the most
common benthic predators on Tegula (Watanabe 1983). Enhydra
lutris, the sea otter, also preys on Tegula, but does not take as
many as the sea stars (Watanabe, 1984).
Tegula abundances in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge were
recorded by Watanabe (1984). In this present study, I duplicated
his study sites and methods, to try produce a dataset comparable
to his, but at a later time. I will compare data from this study
with data from the previous study to examine temporal changes in
Tegula populations over the past 15 years.
