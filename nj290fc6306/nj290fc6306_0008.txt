Subtidal Tegula distributions
were several very successful generations of snails in the recent
past, this would show up as several modes in the adult size
frequency distribution.
Tegula in Southern California also exhibit bathymetric
zonation (Schmitt, 1996), as do many other marine invertebrates
(eg. Connell, 1961; Grosberg, 1982).
This study should be re-done in several years, to determine
whether the observed changes in Tegula abundance are trends or
simply short-term anomalies.
Conclusions
Tegula exhibit a bathymetric zonation in this study area,
similar to that found by Watanabe (1984). Overall Tegula
abundance has increased significantly since Watanabe's 1984
study. Abundance of Tegula montereyi has also increased
noticeably, but the change is not statistically significant.
