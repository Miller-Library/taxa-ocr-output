Subtidal Tegula distributions
placed in haphazard locations within each study site. I counted
individuals of each of the three species of Tegula present in the
quadrat. These numbers were multiplied by four to give densities
(snails per meter?) of each of the three species, in each of the
three depth zones.
To collect the data on Macrocystis plants, I first
haphazardly selected a plant within one study site. Then I
counted all Tegula present on the plant. I began with the bottom
1.5m of kelp, including the holdfast, and counted each subsequent
1.5m section separately. I also counted the number of fronds on
each kelp plant within each 1.5m depth interval. The number of
individual snails of each species was then normalized to number
of snails per frond (in each 1.5m section). To allow direct
comparison with benthic data, these data were then multiplied by
the average number of fronds per plant and average number of
plants per meter?, to yield average number of snails on
Macrocystis per meter? of substrate.
I obtained the raw data from the previous study of the area
by Watanabe (1984), and normalized it to number of snails per
meter?, as outlined above. I then performed a fully factorial,
four-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the numbers, to test for
significant differences between: time (the present study and the
prior one), the three different depths, habitat (benthic vs.
Macrocystis), and snail species. All four factors were
