Subtidal Tegula distributions
Abstract
Abundance and distribution data were collected on three
species of turban snails (Tegula) in a temperate kelp forest, the
Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. Similar data at identical sites in
the same forest were collected by Watanabe (1984). Tegula
abundances from the present study and Watanabe (1984) were
compared. Overall Tegula density has increased significantly
since the earlier study. A bathymetric zonation of Tegula that
was documented in the earlier study was borne out in my study,
Tegula brunnea occurs in shallow water (0-6m), T. pulligo occurs
mostly in deep water (7-12m), and T. montereyi is the least
abundant everywhere, but present everywhere. T. montereyi has
been anecdotally observed to have increased in density in the
past 15 years, and this trend appears in my data, but is not
statistically significant.
