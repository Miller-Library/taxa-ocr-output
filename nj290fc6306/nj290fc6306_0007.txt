Subtidal Tegula distributions
leading to differential predation might maintain the bathymetric
zonation that is set up by larval settlement.
The change in overall Tegula abundance might be linked to a
decrease in abundance of Pisaster giganteus, a sea star and
important predator on all three species of Tegula. P. giganteus
abundance is less now than it was when Watanabe's data was
collected, but the difference is not statistically significant,
(1.63 per 10 m2 in 1980, versus 1.15 per 10 m2 in 1996. Data
from Watanabe, 1984, and Lu, 1996, unpublished data.) These data
are only valid for the middle depth zone.
Another factor that influences adult populations is larval
settlement (eg. Lowry et al. 1974, Watanabe, 1984). If there has
been an increase in settlement rate recently, that could explain
the increase in Tegula populations with no reference to changing
predation. The same is true of a decrease in post-settlement
mortality; it could explain an increase in adult populations.
did not examine larval settlement due to time constraints on my
study.
Another factor that I would have liked to examine but did
not is the size structure of Tegula populations. Size structure
of adult populations would give clues to past patterns of larval
settlement (Lowry et al. 1974, Watanabe 1984). Modes (local
maxima in the size frequency histogram) indicate past years of
unusually successful recruitment (Lowry et al., 1974). If there
