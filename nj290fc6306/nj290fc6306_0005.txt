Subtidal Tegula distributions
considered fixed factors.
Results
The three species of Tegula are distinctly segregated by
depth. T. brunnea occurs more commonly in shallower depths,
closer to shore (subtidally to 6m). T. pulligo is more common
further from shore, deeper (7-12m). T. montereyi does not show a
strong depth zonation, but is less abundant than the other two
species at all study sites (Fig. 3, pÂ«0.001). This is a change
from the situation in the 1930's, when T. montereyi was the most
abundant species (Rudolf Stohler, unpublished data)
The overall Tegula density in the kelp forest at the three
study sites has increased significantly since 1980 (Fig. 4,
p=0.020).
Tegula montereyi had been anecdotally observed to have
increased in numbers between 1978 and 1996. Although this trend
was shown by the data (the mean has doubled since 1978), it was
not statistically significant (p=0.5, see Fig. 4).
There were also some trends in the data I gathered on
Macrocystis plants. T. montereyi were more abundant higher up on
the plants than they were near the holdfast (Fig. 5). At some
places, T. montereyi were even the most abundant species within a
depth interval on a plant. These patterns of zonation within a
