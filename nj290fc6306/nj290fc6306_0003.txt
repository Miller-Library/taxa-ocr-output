Subtidal Tegula distributions
Materials and Methods
All observations were made using SCUBA in the Hopkins Marine
Life Refuge, off Cabrillo Point, California, USA (Fig. 1). Three
study sites located in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge were used
in a study of Tegula conducted in 1978-1981 by Watanabe (1984),
All observations in this present study were carried out at those
study sites. All observations were made during daylight hours,
in April and May of 1996.
The study area consists of rocky (granitic) benches that
gradually give way to pinnacles of rock in deeper water. This
produces a substratum with both horizontal and vertical faces.
Intermixed with the area of rocky substrate are patches of sand
or shell fragment rubble. At the shallower site, there is a
dense understory of Chondracanthus (=Gigartina) corymbifera and
other genera of erect, small (less than .5 m frond length) algae.
At the middle site, this algal turf is replaced by more
encrusting algae and sessile invertebrates. At the deeper site,
the biotic cover becomes a thin, low-relief crust in places.
(For a more complete description of this area, see Riedman et
al., 1981.)
I gathered two different types of data, benthic and on
Macrocystis pyrifera.
To collect the benthic data, I used square 0.25m2 quadrats,
