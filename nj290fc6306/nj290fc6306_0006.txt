Subtidal Tegula distributions
plant are very transitory, since Tegula move so quickly along
kelps. However, the data show some trends of usual heights of
occurrence for Tegula of different species (Fig. 5).
Discussion
More research is needed to determine whether the increase in
Tegula density is a long-term effect or simply a spike in the
population, or a seasonal effect.
Watanabe (1984) examined some possible causes for the
observed habitat partitioning of the Tegula species. He found
that the bathymetric zonation was maintained by an interaction of
several factors. Larval settlement tends to set up the
bathymetric zonation, with T. pulligo larvae settling deep and T.
brunnea shallow. However, since the snails move very rapidly and
live for several years, a mechanism is needed to maintain the
distribution. Watanabe (1984) found in the same study that T.
brunnea is more likely than T. pulligo to travel between
Macrocystis plants on the substrate. T. pulligo travels between
plants mostly through the canopy. Since there is a dense cover
of erect benthic algae in shallower areas of the kelp forest, T.
brunnea traveling between kelps in the shallow study site are
more protected from benthic predation than they would be in
deeper areas, where algal cover is less. So different behaviors
