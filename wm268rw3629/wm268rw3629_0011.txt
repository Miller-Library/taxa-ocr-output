Figures:
1. Lwo upfertilized eggs with the chromosomes visibly in metaphase.
2. Five minutes post-insemination, the sperm nucleus is seen as the
smaller dot. The egg nucleus is just beginning to enter anaphase !.
3. Ten minutes post-insemination, the egg nucleus has already funly
entered anaphase 1 of mejosis to form the first polar body.
4. Fifteen minutes post-insemination, the eggs nucleus has a formed
polar body.
S. Twenty-five minutes post-insemination, the egg nucleus is seen
in apaphase Il of meiosis. The chromosomes divide next to the
site of the first meiotic cleavage. The smaller spot is the sperm
nucleus.
6. Thirty-five minutes after insemination, two polar bodies are seen.
Sixty minutes after fertilization, mitosis is already complete as
can be seen here where two lobes of decondensed DNA have
recently separated The third spot is the combination of two polar
bodies out of focus.
9. Seventy minutes post-insemination, cleavage is finished and the
two polar bodies are seen at the site of the cleavage.
