remoye excess sperm. Sixty ml of pronase stock (Img/mi) was added
to every Iml quantity of egg-FSW solution. Usually pronase stock was
added to egg-FSW mixture four minutes after insemination (in one
case at two minutes). The fertilized eggs were suspended in
propase-FSW mixture for one to two minutes and gently shaken. The
fertilized eggs were then washed twice with FSW to discard the
pronase.
Other fixing and staining techniques
Carpoys was also used without DAPI. Eggs suspended in F5w
were centrifuged and the FSW removed by aspiration. The eggs were
resuspended in carnoys solution for one hour before being washed
with 458 acetic acid. The eggs were viewed under a phase
microscope.
Adetergent-extacted-DAPl prdocedure was also Used to
visualize the chromosomes of the egg (Dr. Daniel Mazia). Eggs were
centrifuged in ESW and the pellet resuspended in KGE solution of ph

glycol bis-(B-aminoethylether) N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid,VEGIA
MA MaSO Stock solution of EGTA is dissolved by titrating with For

suspended in

one volume 103 Triton X-100). Then DAPI was added to make a final
