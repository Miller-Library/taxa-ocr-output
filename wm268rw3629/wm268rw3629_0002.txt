obtained directions from Dr. Daniel Mazia and Dr. Linda Goff. With the
tools for chromosome staining,  have determined the nuclear
cytology of eggs and the early stages of developing zygotes.
Materials and Methods
Handling of gametes:
Acmea incessa were collected at the shorline in Pacific Grove
and Carmel California and kept on fronds of Egregia menziesi in an
outdoor running sea water tank. The tank was covered with a screen
mesh which diffused the bright afternoon sun but allowed enougn
illumination to keep the Egregia in good condition without allowing
the water in the tank to become too warm. In compliance with Sharon
Proctor 's thesis (1968), to induce spawning of the animals, six to
nine individuals were removed form the tank and placed in separate
glass dishes filled with fresh sea water that subsequently was
allowed to slowly reach room temperature (between 18eand 22 0.
As soon as a female animal spawned, the eggs were removed with a
Pasteur pipet and placed in filtered sea water (FSW) in a 16C cool
room. Spawned eperm was similarly removed but placed immediately
into a6Ccold refridgerator. To induce increased gamete release

fter an animal had apawned, some streams of water were auned at
the foot or the dish was jiggled.
Eggs were fertilized within one and a half to two hour
wring by adding a few drope of dilut sperm to the egg-row
mixture. Sperm stored for up to two days at 6 C could still be used
for fertilization.
