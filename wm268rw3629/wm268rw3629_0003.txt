In sgme cases, eggo were aloo acquired by disecting females in
ammonia sea water (sea water titrated to pH 9.5 with MOH). The
ammonia sea water causes gernimal vesicle (GV) breakdown. while
holding the animal in the ammonia sea water, an incision was made in
the gonad and oocytes flushed out of the opening. The released
oocytes were allowed to settle to the bottom of the dish and the
excess sea water was removed by aspiration. The eggs were then
placed in fresh ammonia FSW and allowed to sit for one to two hour
until GV breakdown which is necessary before normal fertilization
Ã§an occur. After GV breakdown and before fertilizing, the eggs were
transferred to normal sea water.
Fixing and staining techniques:
Eggs suspended in FSW were centrifuged, the sea water
aoys fixative
remoyed by aspiration, and the eggs resuspended in Carii
(Jethapol; 1 acetic acid). After and hour of fixing in carnoys, the
eggs were washed in a 707 ethanol solution and recentrifuged. The
banol was removed by aspiration and the remaining
ces were
allowed to evaporate. The eggs were resuspended in FSW and
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPD) stain was added to make a final
concentration of Sugimi (Linda Goff, 1962)DAPI (Sigma Corporation /
wes in astock solution of 1ma/mi in dimethylsulfoxidet OMSO). After
fifteen minutes of staining, the eggs were viewed under a
fluoreceence mierescepe witha UV filter to determine the
cytological state of the chromosomes.
