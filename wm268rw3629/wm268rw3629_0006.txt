One more method of spawning induction was tried. Ten mM
gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) was injected into the foot. The
response was foot flexion and inability to grip the glass dish. No
spawning occured.
Light microcope observations:
Spawned unfertilized eggs appeared opaque and orange-brown
under the phase microscope. No GV was present and internal
structures were not easily visible. A jelly coat surrounded the eggs
but was not apparent unt il sperm was added. The coat was made
apparent by the clear separation between the surrounding sperm and
the egg surface.
Eggs obtained by disection had a jelly coat but also had a GV
that was seen with dark-field. With this illumination, the GV was
seen as a white-orange circle inside the darkere colored egg. Ã„fter
GV breakdown, the eggs obtained by disection appeared identical to
spawned eggs.
Fixation and staining techniques:
The carnoys-DAPI staining technique provided the best
