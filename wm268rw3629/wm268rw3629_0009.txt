Since there is no known method of inducing spawning reliably,
suggest that the best way of obtatning functional gametes is to
induce spawning by letting the animals sit in warm sea water on the
same day that the animals are collected. Also, the water that they
are transported in from the intertidal zone should not be allowed to
become warmer than 16'C.
Spawned eggs were opaque orange and contained no GV contrary
t
to findings by Sharon Proctor (1968). The eggs had a jelly coat diat
was shed after fertilization.
Eggs obtained by disection clearly had a GV before spending one
to two hours in ammonia sea water at pH 9.5. The eggs also had a
jelly coat and not a thick chorion as Sharon Proctor reported (1968).
Nuclear evente
Carpoys-DAPI was the most lucrative method of fixing and
staining Acmea incessa eggs and zygotes. Using this method, the
events of egg maturation after sperm entry were visualized cleary.
Unfertilized eggs were in arrested metaphase as reported by wilson (
1919). After insemination, I found that two polar bodies were formed
efore the nuclear fusion of the sperm and egg. However, did not fix
