Spawning:
Spawning induced by placing individuals in warm sea water was
incopsistent. Often times no spawning would occur at all while at
other times, every individual in the dishes would spawn. My
impressions of the phenomina were that Acmea incessa released
gametes more often if the animals were used on the same day of
collection than if they had been stored in the outdoor tank for a few
days before being used.
Disection:
The limpets that did not spawn were saved for disection. 10
distinquish between male and female gonads, the animal was cut out
of it'sshell. On the dorsal surface, aside the visceral mass, the gonad
was visible. The male gonad appeared orange with smalk creamy
white dots. The femal gonad appeared brown.
The disected female gonads provided eggs with intact GVs. he
GV broke down after an egg sat in ammonia FSW pH9.S for one to twe
hours. Out of four separate attempts at fertilizing disected eggs,

only one attempt was successful.
The disected male gonads provided mostly nonmotile eperm. A
few procedures were tried in order to induce motility. Asmall drop
of EDEA PH 8.0, a crystal of cysteine, and a small drop of spawned
sperm supernatant were all separately added to large drops of
disected sperm on microslides and viewed under a dark field
microscope. All of these procedures produced negative resulte.
