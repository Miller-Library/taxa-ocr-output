the egg and were almost always located at the site of cleavage
(Figures 7 and 8).

upreliable, Disection provided large quantities of gametes, but they
were usually not usable. The sperm was always nonmotile and the
eggs did not ferilize successfully. There was really no good method
of obtaining gametes. With the gametes that were obtained, however,
the chromosomes were successfully fixed and stained with the
carnoys-DAPI preparation. Using this staining method,was able to
account for the cytological changes in the zygote chromosomes up to
the first cleavage.
As already mentioned, there was a correlation between
spawning frequency and the day of collection. It is my impression
that the animals kept in the tank spawned there and resultant ly did
not have any more ripe gametes ready for release when later
subjected to spawning induction methods. This hypothesis is fürther
