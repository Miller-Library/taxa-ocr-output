Different methods of inducing spawning in the gastropod Achea
incessa were investigated. No reliable method was found that could
be used as a generalized technique for mollusc spawning. To stain the
chromosomes of the eggs and developing zygotes, used a method that
required preliminary fixation in carnoys solution followed by DAPI
stain. The developing stages of the zygote chromosomes immediately
l17
after fertinzation up until the first cleavage are documented.
Introduction
Oogenesis, fertilization, and development of the embryo has
been studied extensively in echinoids (Strathmann, 1987 ). Part of
sse gametes have been used is the ease with which they
theresonth
can be studied There are standard methode for constanthy inducing
spawning and large amounts of gametes can be obtained. Also, the
eggs are transparent enough to get a clear view of the internal
ages of developr
organization of the egg during the first

Molluscan egas have been studied little in the past because
