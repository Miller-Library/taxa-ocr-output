fixed the egg and the chromosomes appeared black under phase
microscopic illuminations. However, the yolk granules and other
cellular structures also appeared black, resulting in difficulty in
finding the chromosomes.
The detergent-DAPI procedure stained the chromosome
similarily to the carnoys-DAPI procedure. However, the fine
structure of the chromosomes was not as apparent, appearing as
plurred fluorescent dots.
Nuclear events.
The carnoys-DAPl technique was used to visualize the egg and
sperm chromosome structure before and af ter fertilization. Portions
of pewly fertilized eggs were fixed with carnoys every five minutes
up to the first cleavage. Unfertilized eggs were found to be in
rested metaphase IFigure 1). They had not yet gone through the
mejotic divisions that produce poiar bodies. Within five minutes
after
perm addition, cells had bare ly begun to enter anaphase
(Figure 2). Between five and fifteen minutes after fertilization, the
zygote had formed one polar body (PB) which stayed intact at the edge
of the zygote (Figures Jand 4). At twenty five minutes, the meiotic
apararus of anaphase Il occured next to the site where the firet PE
asformed (Figure 5). Between twenty-five and thirty-five
minutes after fertilization, the second PB had formed and remained at
the outer edge of the zygote next to the first PE (Eigure eE
minutes after fertilization, the zygote was already dividing (Figure
