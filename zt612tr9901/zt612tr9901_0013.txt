tides. If the ammonia synthesized and stored in the kidney
were excreted during this period, the amount in the
kidney would be less at high tide than during the ascending
tide. Moisture would facilitate ammonia excretion, since
ammonia is soluble in water. Because large concentrations
of ammonia are toxic, storing quantities of ammonia for
extended periods of time might be harmful to the animal;
thus the snails have ammonia available to excrete only
during those times at which they are assured of the availÂ¬
ability of moisture, i.e., at night, when dew falls, and
at the high tides.
This hypothesis indicated that rates of synthesis,
as well as amounts of available excretory products, may
vary. Preliminary studies found that, over a four hour
period of testing, the test water contained increasing
amounts of ammonia for the first one to two hours, yet,
after two hours, the concentration of ammonia in the test
water remained fairly constant during the day. However,
during the night, the concentration of ammonia in the test
water increased over the entire four hour test period.
During the day, the snails, in the first one to two hours
of immersion, may have excreted any ammonia which they had
accumulated. After this point, levels of excretory products
would increase only slightly, if at all, if the rate of
synthesis is low. At night, however, the amount excreted
would continue to increase to a greater extent if the rate
of synthesis is appreciably higher. Figure 7 gives data
