decreased, however, despite the occurrence of high tide;
two factors may account for this. Firstly, a similarly
low level of excretory activity is displayed by snails
taken from the field, in Figures 2 and 5; however, these
low levels coincide with the low tide. Secondly, if
the above hypothesis describing dew as a false moisture
cue is correct, many of the snails may have excreted
during what they assumed would be an ascending tide; yet,
at high tide, when no moisture was forthcoming, some did
not excrete, or excreted less. Such a conjecture is sup¬
ported by the findings graphed in Figures 2 and 3, where
snails kept dry for twenty hours after twenty-eight hours
of testing excreted less than they had at the same time
on the previous day. Due to the large confidence inter¬
vals and the small range of means, Figure 4 does not in¬
dicate that any appreciable correlation exists between the
amount excreted and either light or tidal conditions.
While a large measure of variability may be due to dif¬
ferences among the five groups, i.e., different groups
of fifty snails were tested at each dampling time, this
graph may also indicate that, deprived of moisture, L.
planaxis has less ammonia available to excrete.
If the snails are given what appears to be an op¬
portunity to continue to make and excrete ammonia, i.e.,
if they are periodically immersed as those in Figures 2
and 3 were, test conditions of constant light and constant
dark might obliterate the diurnal correlations observed
