might reveal the degree of tidal influence.
The hypothesis that moisture is a stimulus to excrete
is supported by the data shown in Figure 4. The values
obtained at the first sample time, 1400 hours, are almost
identical to those in Figure 1, from snails brought in
from the field and tested at 1400 hours. However, these
snails fail to show any large increase in the amount
excreted, despite the onset of darkness. While mean values
for snails taken from the field range from 1.15 to 2.60
Ug NHa/ g snail, the mean values for the snails which
were kept dry only range from .65 to 1.30 ug NH3/g snail.
The small 95% confidence interval at 1600 hours, during
low tide, may be due to the fact that, at this time,
experimental conditions most nearly paralleled conditions
in the field. As the tide rises, yet the snails exper¬
ience no increase in moisture, there is no large increase
in mean values, while 95% confidence intervals increase.
The snails are differentially affected by the absence of
moisture. The interval is again small at 0830 hours;
this test period occurs after sunrise, on the ascending
tide. Moisture from dew had been observed in the container;
perhaps, if the snails are indeed on a tidal cycle, this
moisture signifies an incoming tide to some, which, an¬
ticipating a return of normal conditions, begin to excrete
at a normal level. The mean value here, 1.20 +.20 ug NH./
g snail, is quite similar to that found in the field study
at 0830, 1.20 +.45 ug NH3/g snail. The value at 1200
