Results
The fluctuations in ammonia excretion by animals
during the tidal and diurnal cycles were studied as follows.
Snails were collected from the field at the high and
low tides and at times intermediate between these extreme
points. Snails were brought into the laboratory and
tested within fifteen minutes. Figure 1 shows the results
of this study. Note the wide range of amounts of ammonia
excreted at different times. Individual values range from
.65 to 3.05 ug NH3/ g snail, and the means range from
1.15 to 2.60 ug NH3/ g snail. The lowest individual
value and the lowest mean value both occur during the day¬
time low tide, while the highest individual value and the
highest mean value both occur at high tide after sunset.
The lowest values obtained during the night, during the
falling and low tides, have means 22% and 61% higher, respec¬
tively, than means for similar points on the tidal cycle
during the day. During the night, excretory activity in¬
creases throughout the tidal cycle.
A similar study was made using the same five groups
of ten snails at each sample time in an attempt to decrease
the variability observed in the previous study. Fifty
snails were collected at 0900 hours, on the ascending tide.
Between sampling times, the snails were left outside the
laboratory, subjected to the normal diurnal regime, and
brought into the laboratory only for testing. This ex¬
