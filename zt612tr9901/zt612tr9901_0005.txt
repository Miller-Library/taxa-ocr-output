large rise in amount of ammonia excreted which was evi¬
dent in the previous two studies is not apparent. The
range of means is much narrower, .65 to 1.10 ug NH3/g snail.
The smallest 95% confidence interval occurs at the low
tide, 1600 hours, only two hours after collection. As
the tide rises, yet the period of dryness increases, var¬
iability increases, except for the point at 0830, on the
ascending tide just after sunrise. The lowest mean occurs
at 1200 hours, the final testing point, at the high tide.
Under abnormal moisture conditions, the snails display a
high degree of individual variability. Some may have been
affected more by the lack of moisture and excreted less, or
not at all.
A fourth experiment, shown in Figures 5 and 6, ex¬
amined differences in excretory behavior between snails
kept in constant light or constant dark. One hundred
snails were collected from the field at 0900 hours, on
the descending tide. Fifty snails, in five groups of ten
each, were placed in constant dark and fifty were placed
in constant light. The first sample was tested at 1100
hours, during the low tide, so that the snails in the
dark had two hours to respond to the change in light
conditions. The same ten groups, five in constant arti¬
ficial light and five in constant dark, were sampled at
each test time. Both groups showed peaks of excretion at
the high tide; the snails kept in constant light showed
a larger difference in amplitude between day and night peaks
than those kept in the dark. During hours of normal daylight,
