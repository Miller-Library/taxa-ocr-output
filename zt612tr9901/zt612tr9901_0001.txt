Introduction
The high intertidal gastropod Littorina planaxis
excretes a variety of nitrogenous waste products (Campbell,
1970; Cox, 1964; Duerr, 1968; Needham, 1938). In the
kidney, ammonia is the predominant non-protein nitrogenous
waste product (Campbell, 1970; Cox, 1964). Cox found
evidence of a tidal rhythmicity in the amount of ammonia
found in the kidney. The highest concentrations of
ammonia were found during the ascending tides. After
this point, the amount decreased, reaching a minimum
value at low tide. While small amounts of ammonia may
be liberated as gas when the animals are dry (Lebenzon,
1964), Duerr (1968) found that several species of marine
prosobranch molluscs, including Littorina sitkana, excrete
ammonia in solution upon being immersed. Immersion may
stimulate excretion. Kops (1964) found that moisture
was a stimulus to activity. While Kops found no evidence
of a circadian effect on activity, observations indicate
that physical activity does increase at night, and an in¬
crease in metabolic and/or excretory activity may parallel
this increase. If moisture is indeed a stimulus for ac¬
tivity and for excretion, L. planaxis may be exploiting
two periods of high moisture. The rocky substrate on
which it lives is moistened by the splash of the high
tide and by dew which condenses during the night. Fluc¬
