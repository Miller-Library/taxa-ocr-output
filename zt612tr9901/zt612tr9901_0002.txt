Materials and Methods
Snails were collected from the rocky intertidal at
the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California.
The vertical range of the collecting site was 8 to 12 feet
above mean lower low water. Ammonia was collected from
five replicates of ten snails each, which were placed in
250 ml. beakers with 5 ml. sea water and swirled, to wet
the snails thoroughly. After one hour, the beakers were
swirled again to mix the sample, the snails were removed,
and the water was centrifuged to remove fecal material.
One ml. aliquots were removed and tested for the presence
of ammonia using a colorimetric proceedure (Ternberg and
Hershey, 1964). After color development, centrifugation
was necessary to remove precipitated carbonates. Samples
were read in a Gilson 252 Spectrophotometer at 625 nm,
against a distilled water blank, and corrected for any
ammonia present in the sea water used for collecting
ammonia.
Duerr (1968) found a correlation between the amount
of ammonia excreted and the total weight of the animal.
The amounts of excreted ammonia were normalized by dividing
by the weight of the snails sampled, and expressed as
ug ammonia/ g snail.
