seem to anticipate the high tide which occurs at sunrise.
Two possible explanations of this behavior exist. The
snails, deprived of normal light/dark cues, may have mis¬
calculated the time of high tide; since high tide occured
at sunrise, the snails would be expected to excrete rela¬
tively large amounts at the onset of light, yet they
receive no change in light conditions which might cue
their response. On the other hand, prior to this time,
none of the groups excrete large amounts which would
normally be excreted during hours of darkness; perhaps
they are storing ammonia until internal concentrations reach
levels which they can no longer tolerate, and they excrete,
regardless of time of day or point in the tidal cycle.
The constant dark groups 9 and 10 did not show an increase
and decrease in values during the daytime high tide. Per¬
haps the sudden advent of darkness failed to elicit the
increase in amount excreted observed in the other two
groups. Note, however, that sunset coincides with the
falling tide on this day; the snails may have been res¬
ponding to what appeared to be sunset, and excreted smaller
amounts of ammonia until the tide began to rise, after
0300 hours. The premature onset of darkness does not,
however, seem to affect the tidal pattern of excretion
beyond the first tidal cycle. Further investigations of
levels of excretory activity under prolonged constant
light and constant dark regimes might elucidate the nature
