of this excretory rhythmicity, i.e., whether it is truly
endogenous or rather a response to external conditions,
Thus, while light conditions appear to be the strongest
factor influencing ammonia excretion, the absence of light
and dark cues make tidal correlations more apparent.
Given the high intertidal habitat of L. planaxis, which
has a vertical distribution of 5 to 12 feet above mean
lower low water (Peterson, 1964), night appears to be
a more reliable moisture cue; while dew is usually deposited
on the rocks after dark, the snails may not always be splashed
by the high tide, depending in their position on the rocks
and the height of the surf.
Note that, while in previous tests, Figures 2,3 and 4,
the absence of moisture seems to inhibit ammonia excretion,
the periodic wetting of the snails, which eliminates
normal tidal cues, does not appear to damp out variations
in levels of excretion apparently correlated with the tide.
Cox (1964) found the lowest amount of ammonia in the kidÂ¬
neys at lower low water, the period of maximum dryness;
this finding corroborates the results which indicate that
snails which are kept dry excrete less ammonia. Perhaps
moisture is not only a stimulus for excretion, but,
under conditions of periodic moisture, the snail has more
ammonia available to excrete. Cox also found that the
kidneys contained the greatest amount of ammonia on the
ascending tide. The snails have been shown to excrete the
largest amounts of ammonia on the ascending and high
