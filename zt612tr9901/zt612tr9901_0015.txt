Summary
1) Moisture appears to be a stimulus for ammonia
excretion; since this nitrogenous waste product is water¬
soluble, ambient moisture would facilitate diffusion.
2) L. planaxis displays peaks of excretory activity
which coincide with times of greatest moisture, i.e.,
night and high tide, thus maximizing opportunities for
excretion.
3) Light and dark seem to be the strongest factors
influencing this change in excretory activity; the tidal
correlations become more apparent when normal light and
dark cues are removed.
4) If deprived of moisture, L. planaxis excretes
smaller amounts of ammonia; since this compound is toxic,
ammonia synthesis could be harmful if no means were avail¬
able for excretion.
5) Rates of ammonia synthesis appear to be greater
at night than during the day.
