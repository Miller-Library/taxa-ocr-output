in Figures 2 and 3. In Figure 5, the mean values of
both the groups kept in constant light and those kept
in constant dark parallel the tidal cycle. The smaller
amplitude of the daytime peak of the snails kept in
constant light is consistent with results indicating
that less ammonia is excreted during the day. The maxi¬
mum nighttime values, at the peak of high tide, are al¬
most identical to those of snails kept in constant dark¬
ness, and are greater than those obtained from the snails
described in Figure 2. This suggests that, at least during
the first day of constant light, an endogenous rhythmicity
in excretory activity is not damped out. The snails are
perhaps differentially affected by the abnormal conditions,
however; while these five groups has 95% confidence inter¬
vals of +.20 to +.40 ug NH3/ g snail during normal hours
of daylight, the confidence intervals increase to +.65
to +1.10 ug NHa/ g snail after the time of sunset. The
snails placed in constant darkness always displayed
high variability; once more, some may have been affected
more than others by the abnormal conditions. The constant
dark groups, also paralleling the tidal cycle, gave higher
values during daylight hours than the snails kept in con¬
stant light; the artificial onset of darkness seems to
be a cue to increase ammonia excretion. Following the
patterns of individual groups, Figure 6, groups 1-8 parallel
both tidal cycles. The constant light groups 3, 4 and 5
