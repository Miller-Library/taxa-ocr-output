the 95% confidence interval of snails kept in the light
was similar to that of snails periodically immersed yet
kept on a normal day/night cycle, see Figure 2. After the
time of sunset, however, the 95% confidence intervals
increased, becoming almost three times that of snails in
Figure 2 at 0400 hours. The snails kept in constant dark
had consistently larger confidence intervals than those
of Figure 2, increasing up to 188% at 0000 hours. Again,
under abnormal conditions, the snails display a greater
degree of individual variability.
Another set of investigations attempted to discover
if any relationship exists between amounts of ammonia syn¬
thesized and time of day. At 1100 and 2100 hours, the standard
sampling proceedure was followed, although sample size was
increased to twenty snails and 10 ml. of sea water was
used. At fifteen minute intervals, samples were withdrawn
and fresh sea water was added to maintain a constant vol¬
ume. The values for subsequent readings were corrected for
this dilution effect. Figure 7 shows the difference
between two groups of snails, one from each testing period.
Initially, the amounts of ammonia excreted by the two groups
appear to be identical. However, during the night,
amounts excreted increase more than during the day.

The presence or absence of light seems to be the
