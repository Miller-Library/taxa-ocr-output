periment eliminated any tidal effect, because the snails
were immersed every three hours. Figure 2 presents the
results. Figure 3 shows the amount excreted by the in¬
dividual test groups.
Again, the lowest values are obtained during the
daylight hours; values rose as night approached and
decreased again after sunrise. Variability did decrease;
the 95% confidence intervals ranged from +.05 to +.50 ug NH3/
g snail, while the 95% confidence intervals for values
obtained during the field study ranged from +.15 to +.90
Ug NH3/g snail. The snails excreted an average of 40%
more ammonia the next morning, after twenty-four hours
of periodic immersion. After the final test at 1400 hours,
the snails were again placed outside and tested after
twenty hours of dryness. The mean value, .03 ug NHa/g snail,
decreased to the level obtained at the start of the first
day, when the snails had been collected on a low tide.
Since a period of dryness appears to depress excretory
activity, the next study examined the effects of prolonged
dryness, Figure 4. Four hundred snails were collected at
1330 hours, on the descending tide. The snails were
kept in an open container outside, subject to the normal
light regime, to normal temperature fluctuations and to
deposition of dew, yet were removed from the beach area,
eliminating any exogenous tidal influences. At every
test time, fifty fresh snails were taken from the con¬
tainer and brought into the laboratory for testing. The
