for two different groups of twenty snails each, one tested
during the morning and the other tested in the evening,
while kept in constant dark. These two groups show striking
differences in excretory behavior. While the initial
excretory rates of the two groups seem comparable, the
snails tested during the day seem to synthesize and excrete
a smaller amount of ammonia than those tested at night.
The effect of tide on rates of excretion remains to be
determined.
