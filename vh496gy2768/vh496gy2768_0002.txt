DISTRIBUTION OF THE TERRESTRIAL ISOPOD ALLONISCUS PEROONVEXUS ON A
SANDY BEACH AND FACTORS AFFECTING ITS RANGE AND POPULATION DENSITI
INTRODUCTION
The isopod Alloniscus perconvexus (Dana, 1854) has been noted
as a common inhabitant of sandy beaches by several authors (Van Name,
1936; Light et al, 1954; and Richardson, 1905). However, little else
is known of its biology other than its tolerances to salinity which
was examined by Brusca, 1965. The present study was undertaken to
determine the distribution of this isopod on a typical sandy beach,
and to examine various physical parameters that might affect its
range, activity, and population density. Special attention was
payed to the influence of moisture content of the sand, tidal height,
and the availability of food. Furthermore, laboratory investigations
were conducted to determine responses to light, moisture gradients,
and to investigate possible thigmotaxis and food preference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Area
The distribution of Alloniscus was studied on a pocket beach
on the southeast side of Point Cabrillo in Pacific Grove, California.
A 15-meter wide section of this beach that was relatively uniform in
appearance was intensively studied. The beach was semi-exposed, with
