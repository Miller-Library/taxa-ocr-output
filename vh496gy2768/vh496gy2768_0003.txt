a slope of approximately .21 meters tidal height. The approximate
sand size throughout this section showed a Mdo of -.1. There was
a belt of beach grass immediately above the berm, and a large bank
of iceplant at the head of the beach. No small rocks were present
on the surface and few were buried beneath the sand.
Distribution
Ten transects approximately 1.5 meters apart were studied under
differing conditions of low and high tide, during both night and day.
Investigations were made between April 19, 1972 and May 23, 1972.
Cores were taken every .75 meters along each transect. The corer
(Fig. 1A) was an aluminum box, 25.08 cm x 25.08 cm x 28.57 cm, with
two open ends. Four metal strips 24.45 cm x 5.08 cm were attached
to the top of the corer to allow the box to be easily withdrawn
from the sand. The corer was hammered into the sand, which was
subsequently scooped out with a trowel into a sieve with a screen
size of 3 mmx 3 mm. At each station, for convenience in handling,
the core was divided into two sections. The top 10 cm of sand were
sifted first, and the number of A. perconvexus and quantity of algae
and large pieces of detritus recorded. The remaining 15 cm of the
core was subsequently treated similarly. The sampling along a transect
was ended when no Alloniscus had been obtained from two consecutive
cores.
The distribution of isopods moving on the surface of the sand
during the night was likewise studied. Traps were set along a single
transect on each of two nights. In one study the traps were set
