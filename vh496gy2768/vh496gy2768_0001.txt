ABSTRACT
The range and distribution of the beach isopod Alloniscus perconvexus
was found to change over time. Compression and expansion of the
range was observed to coincide with spring and neap tides, respectively.
The upper limit of the distribution seemed to be set by moisture
content of the sand, whereas extreme tidal height appeared to
delimit the lower limits of the isopod's range. Range expansion
and compression takes place by nighttime activity patterns. While
the organism appears to be highly sensitive to the moisture content
of the sand, and moves in direct relationship to moisture gradients,
its activity can be modified by the presence of light, which
inhibits all movement, and by a thigmotactic response which is
often enhanced by the presence of potential food. Wave action
and physical disturbance may reinforce those factors delineating
its lower limits on the beach.
