Food
Two types of food of A. perconvexus were found: dead O. californiana
and pieces of Macrocystis. The isopods ingested these dyed materials,
turning their intestines bright red.
The experiment to find food preferences was not successful.
The isopods did not tend to cluster in the compartment that held
their "preferred" food. Large holes were seen in the pieces of
Macrocystis, however.
DISCUSSION
The distribution of Alloniscus was found to shift in relation
to tidal height. The upper limit of the population was quite stable
at a tidal height of about 5.6 m, but the lower limit changed
drastically with time. The range appears to decrease greatly
during spring tides when waves reach the upper portions of the beach.
Higher water caused a restriction of the population to the upper
beach, while a period of low calm water enabled the range to be
expanded to a tidal height as low as 3.6 m during the period of study,
It is not known, however, whether this represents the lowest possible
range of this species. While distribution of Alloniscus appears to be
very much influenced by long term cycles of spring and neap tides,
the populations do not move greatly during a single 24 hour period.
Moisture content of sand was also believed to play an important
role in setting an upper limit for the distribution of these isopods.
They were not found at a moisture level lower than .65%. No isopods
occurred above 5.6 m tidal height, which was found on one occasion
