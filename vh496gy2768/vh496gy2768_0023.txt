Figure 2:
meters along 6 transects studied on April 25, April 28,
May 1, May 9, May 17, and May 28. The intertidal height
of the highest waves recorded during each study period
is indicated by a horizontal line. The arrow on the last
transect (May 28) indicates the height of waves the previous
night. Numbers were determined by coring every .75 meters
along each transect.

cubic meters as observed over a 24-hour period on May 22
to May 23. The intertidal height of the highest waves
recorded during each study period is indicated by a
horizontal line. Numbers were determined by coring
every.75 meters along each transect.

Figure 4:
May 22 from 8:00 PM - 7:00 AM. Collections were taken
every hour.
4A: Traps were set every .75 meters along the transect to a
tidal height of 5.3 m.
AB: Traps were set every 1.5 meters along the transect to
a tidal height of 3.2 m. The moon was shining until
11:45 PM, when it was covered by clouds.
