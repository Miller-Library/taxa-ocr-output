and April 28 were studied after a period of high tides and strong
winds; waves had reached tidal heights of 4.8 m during this time.
The range of A. perconvexus during these two studies was relatively
short, with large numbers of individuals concentrated over a small
area. On the other hand, the distributions on May 9, May 17, and
May 22 indicated a greater range and a shift in relative numbers.
The waves at this time reached tidal heights of only 1.2 to 3.5 m.
The weather had been much calmer and the waves had not come so far
up the beach previous to these dates. However, on May 27 water
came to the 4.86 m tidal height. The range in this transect was
once again highly restricted.
In contrast, the four distributions shown in Figure 3 indicate
that the range of Alloniscus does not change greatly with the four
tides occurring during any given 24-hour period.
Activity
The activity pattern of Alloniscus was also observed on this
beach. During the day, the isopod was found burrowed in the sand,
a large majority (758) within the top 10 cm of the surface. On
dark nights, many came to the top but their behavior could not be
observed directly. The isopods stopped movement immediately when
illuminated with a beam of white light from a flashlight. Red light
produced by taping red cellophane over the flashlight brought about
the same response.
Traps were found to be the best way to determine nighttime
activity. Results shown in Figure 4A were obtained April 22,
during the period of higher water described earlier. Note that
