A gradient box made of plexiglas (Fig. 1B), devised by Mr. Samuel
Johnson at Hopkins Marine Station, was utilized. Four pieces
(42.55 cm x 47.63 cm, 42.55 cm x 47.63 cm, 10.16 cm x 45.08 cm,
and 10.16 cm x 42.55 cm) were fastened together to form an open¬
ended box. The two smaller side-pieces were attached so that one
was at the same level as the top and the other 2.5 cm below the top.
Grooves were cut in the 42.55 cm x 47.63 cm sides, so slats serving
as top and bottom could be slid into place (dimensions 45.72 cmx
10.79 cm). Grooves were also cut, perpendicular to the top and
bottom, dividing the large sides into four. Three 41.59 cm x 10.48 cm
slats could then be slid into these grooves, creating four separate
compartments.
Moisture Preference
The isopods were first tested for moisture preferences. Sand
from the study area was completely dried in an oven at 80° C. for
approximately 24 hours, and then mixed with sea water to arrive at
the desired moisture level. The weight of 1 liters of sand was
approximately 733 grams, thus 43.98 ml sea water were added for
every 2% increase in moisture content. A gradient of O, 28, 48,
and 10 moisture content was set up, using 1 liters of sand per
compartment. 10 large Alloniscus (11 mm - 16 mm) were placed in
each section and allowed to burrow. The partitions were removed,
the sand smoothed, and the top slat slid into place to prevent
evaporation. A control box was similarly set up with 2% moisture
content throughout. The two boxes were then covered with black
