to have a water content as low as.1% and never above.8.
Correspondingly, in laboratory experiments, definite movement was
observed away from sand with little or no moisture content. Sand
moisture content at the isopod's lower limit was less constant,
varying from 2.75% to 7.3%. However, the majority of Alloniscus
were almost always found in sand with a 28 to 3% moisture content,
The presence of detritus and objects in the sand had a great
effect on population density, both in the field and in laboratory
experiments. Large numbers congregated where many pieces of large
damp algae were found buried within the top 10 centimeters. This
seemed to indicate either thigmotactic behavior or attraction to
a food source. However, it was not possible to determine if the
organisms could eat while burrowed in the sand.
Sand size was not considered to be a significant factor in
determining distribution.
Experiments in the laboratory confirmed trends noted in the
field but also raised several questions. In moisture gradients, the
isopods consistently moved out of the  (.218) compartment, in
accordance with field data. On the other hand, in the gradient
boxes the isopods congregated at a greater moisture level than they
were normally associated with on the beach. Apparently other parameters
in the field inhibit this movement toward higher water contents.
Wave action, physical disturbance, and the presence of detritus
might be important variables in this regard.
Evidence was obtained to indicate that the isopods were positively
thigmotactic. No only did they cluster in areas containing large
pieces of algae buried in the sand, but in addition, in many controls
