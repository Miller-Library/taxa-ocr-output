plastic sheeting and left overnight at room temperature for 15 hours.
At the termination of the experiment, partitions were hammered into
the sand. Each compartment was then sifted separately and the isopods
recovered. After completion of the experiment, the moisture content
of each compartment was determined once again as noted above.
Two additional sets of moisture gradients were set up, with O,
48, &amp, 12, and 10, 12, 1%, 16% moisture content, respectively.
Thigmotaxis
To measure thigmotactic responses, a gradient of O, 13, 8.
and 12% moisture content was again set up, with 4 Macrocystis floats
half buried in the sand in both the O and compartments. A moisture
gradient containing no algae was used as a control.
Salinity - Light
Two variations of the moisture gradient O, 28, 48, and 10% were
conducted, to test the effects of salinity and light. In one experiment
distilled water rather than sea water was utilized to moisten the sand
in both experimental and control boxes. In another experiment, using
the same gradient, the two boxes were kept under constant illumination
from an overhead light. 20 large isopods (11 mm - 16 mm) and 20 small
isopods (6 mm - 8 mm) were used per box.
Observations were next conducted to test the effects of light
and dark on large and small Alloniscus. Four plexiglas boxes were
filled with sand of 2% moisture content. 40 isopods were placed
in each, two containing large and two with small organisms. Two of
