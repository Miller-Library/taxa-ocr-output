.75 meters apart, and in another, 1.5 meters apart. The traps were
glass bowls 5.0 cm in diameter and 10.2 cm deep, positioned in the
sand so that the top of the bowl was level with the surface. Organisms
walking on the sand fell into the bowls and were unable to climb up
the glass sides.
Physical Factors
To find those factors that might most readily affect the range
and population density of Alloniscus, environmental parameters were
likewise measured in the sample area. Moisture content of the sand,
temperature, presence of food on the surface, presence of objects
in the sand, and sand size were monitored for many of the transects
studied.
When a given tide was at its highest or lowest point, samples
of sand were taken every five feet along a single transect, both
at the surface and 10 cm below. The moisture content of the sand
was calculated by weight loss after drying to constant weight.
Temperature was also recorded with standard Centigrade ther-
mometers at the sand surface and 10 cm below, every 1.5 meters
along the transect. Finally, the presence of grass or detritus on
the surface and the quantity of objects in the sand were generally
observed and recorded. The sand size was determined by dry sieving
through a series of standard Tyler screens according to the methods
of Morgans, 1956.
Experimental
Experiments were conducted on the isopods to test the effects
of moisture, light, and the presence of objects and food in the sand.
