activity was confined to the upper beach with 32% of the isopods
caught between tidal heights 5.7 m to 6.0 m. However, there was
a striking contrast between these results and those shown in Figure 4B,
taken on May 22 after a period of lower water. No isopods at all
were collected between tidal heights 5.7 mto 6.0 m and the isopods
were seen to be active down to a tidal height of 3.5 m.
An indication of their aversion to light can be obtained from
Figure AB. During this study period, the moon was shining brightly
until 11:45 PM. Clouds then covered the moon and the surroundings
became much darker. Only six isopods were caught before 12:15 AM,
whereas 167 in total were obtained from 12:15 AM to 5:15 AM.
Similarly, only 3 Alloniscus were caught from 5:15 AM to 6:15 AM,
when the sky was gradually lightening.
Physical Parameters
Sand moisture was next studied along each transect. The
surface tended to be consistently dry (below .5% moisture) whereas
distinct differences were noted along the transects 10 cm below the
surface. In Figure 5, moisture content 10 cm below was plotted against
the four distributions taken on May 1, May 17, and the two taken on
May 22. The range in which Alloniscus occurs had a water content of
.65% to 7.3%. A marked difference was once again evident between the
distribution of May 1 and the later four study periods. The range
and population density shifted down the beach as the moisture content
dropped. On the transect taken on May 1, the percent water at tidal
height 4.8 m was 4.34%, whereas the average at this point for the later
distributions was only 2.218. Thus, the distribution of Alloniscus
