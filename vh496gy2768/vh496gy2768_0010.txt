appeared to change with fluctuations in moisture content. Note
also, that at low tides, Alloniscus appeared in greatest densities
in sand of approximately 3% moisture content.
Field observations indicated that Alloniscus seemed to
congregate in areas in which much algae was buried beneath the
surface. As many as 42 organisms were found at a single such
location. In Figure 3, the first transect contained a large amount
of buried material at 4.5 mtidal height. The next three transects
had a scanty amount at this level, and correspondingly fewer Alloniscus
were collected.
The isopods were found in sand with temperatures 10 cm below
ranging from 21.2° C. to 13.2° C. On any single study period,
however, there were no drastic fluctuations along the transect,
but rather gradual changes (Figure 6). The temperature at the
surface showed more drastic changes, with ranges of 27.50 C. to
9.100.
Sand size on the surface and 10 cm below did not change
drastically along a transect in this section of the beach. Along
one transect, from 5.8 m to 3.5 m tidal height, Md o 10 cm below
ranged from.4 to.6.
Experimental
Typical results of gradient experiments designed to determine
preferred moisture content showed that Alloniscus congregated to a
large extent in the wettest portion (Table 1). Using the chi square
