the boxes were placed under a bright lamp, and the others outside in
the dark. The numbers of isopods remaining on the surface were
recorded every hour.
Food
A test was made to verify the suspected food of A. perconvexus.
Dead Orchestoidea californiana and pieces of the algae Macrocystis
were soaked in the vital dye Rose Bengal. They were then drained,
blotted, and put on the surface of moist sand in separate glass
bowls. 10 large isopods which had been kept in the laboratory for
two days were introduced in each bowl and placed in the dark. The
bodies of the isopods were examined 24 hours later for the presence
of dye.
A final experiment was conducted to identify possible food
preferences. Three plexiglas boxes were filled with 14 liters of
sand with 4% water content. In one box, one fourth of the surface
of each compartment was covered by a different type of dry wrack:
Cystoseira, Gigartina corymbifera, Macrocystis, and Phyllospadix.
The second box was similarly filled with damp wrack. The third
served as a control, containing no algae.
RESULTS

the study as indicated in Figure 2. The transects on April 25
