test, such a distribution was significant to the 98 confidence level.
The average moisture content in the four compartments after 15 hours
was .218, 2.93, 5.00%, and 7.42%, while the control was 1.90%, 1.768,
1.90, and 1.878.
Similar trends of orientation toward the wettest sand were also
found with large isopods tested in moisture gradients of G, 18, 88,
and 124 (Table 2). Again the results were significant to the 905
confidence level. The former experiment was duplicated by using
40 small A. perconvexus (6 mm - 8 mm). These smaller animals also
moved toward the wettest portion (Table 3). Chi square tests showed
this distribution not to be significant, due to an extreme bias in
the control. In the controls, the isopods showed a tendency to cluster
in one or both of the end compartments. When this data was compared
with an idealized control of 10 isopods per compartment, significance
to the 95% confidence level was obtained. The control shown in
Table 2 also exhibited a large degree of clustering. This was
considered to be another indication of thigmotaxis. All of the
controls except those run in the light appear to be biased by the
tendency of animals to cluster in the corners.
Small isopods placed in a gradient of 105, 12%, 14%, and 16%
showed little tendency to move (Table 4). While the observation
was made that Alloniscus can survive for several hours submerged in
sea water, it is suggested that these moisture contents may be well
above those normally encountered by the species and activity may be
reduced in saturated or near saturated sand.
