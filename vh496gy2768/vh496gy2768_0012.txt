Results from the experiment designed to test for a thigmotactic
response (Table 5) showed that more isopods congregated in the 4%
sand containing Macrocystis floats than in the control. This
distribution was significant to the 99.9 confidence level.
Results were drastically different between gradients run in the
dark and light. Those run in the dark showed the greatest number
of organisms occurred in the sand of highest moisture content (10)
and thus was significant to the 99% confidence level. A similar
experiment run in the Might, however, showed no significant change
in distribution (Table 6). The isopods showed considerable movement
in the dark, but much less tendency to move in the light. The boxes
in the dark had approximately 60 holes on the surface, indicating
that many of the isopods had come to the surface. Those boxes under
constant illumination, however, had only 5 holes. Some organisms
may have emerged from sand with O moisture content, but the sand
was so dry that no trace of any holes was left. In the control run
in the light, the typical movement toward one of the end compartments
did not occur, while the control in the dark once again showed a
a tendency of the animals to aggregate at the corners.
The observations made of activity patterns in organisms moving
over the surface of the sand were scored every hour in boxes placed
in the light and dark are recorded in Figure 7. It is significant
that no isopods were seen on the surface in the box kept under
constant light, while in the dark, approximately t of those originally
placed in the box were observed on the surface every hour.
