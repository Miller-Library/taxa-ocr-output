run in the laboratory experiments, there was a tendency for the
animals to group in the end compartments. While food studies
indicated that A. perconvexus was a scavenger, eating surface detritus
including wrack and dead Orchestoidea, it was not possible to
distinguish between a positive thigmotactic response and attraction
to food.
Changes in salinity had no effect on the distribution and
movements seen in the experiments conducted, and it did not appear
as an important factor in the field studies either.
Light had a great influence on the isopod's behavior. In the
illuminated gradient test, very few individuals came to the surface,
and comparatively little movement occurred. Field studies also
indicated that Alloniscus were negatively phototactic. They came
to the surface only on dark nights; moonlight was sufficient to
inhibit their emergence.
In summary, the distribution of A. perconvexus was found to
change greatly with time. The upper limit of their range was determined
by moisture content of the sand, whereas the lower limit seemed to
be set by tidal height and the height of the high tides of the
spring and neap tides. Population density resulted from movements
along the beach. Spring tides caused a compression of the range
and a consequent increase in population density in the upper beach.
The lower neap tides allowed the range to expand down the beach,
in general reducing the density at any given point. Several factors
appear to modify this general pattern of distribution. The isopods
cluster in areas containing large quantities of buried algae. This
