on the bottom and greater than 750 ft-candles 3M below
the surface. On June 2 at noon, the gradient was from 5
ft.-candles on the bottom to 90 ft-candles 3M below the
surface.) If changing light intensity as occurs at dawn
and dusk is a cue for vertical migration (as it appears
from aquarium studies, fig.3; and Verwey, 1966), less
change in intensities between day and night would cause
less vertical movement. Comparing fig.l to fig.2, the
changes in the mean height over 24 hour periods are
greater for the data collected earlier in the investigation
when the light gradient was larger. This supports the idea
that differences in the light gradient may cause differences
in the amount of vertical movement. It appears that surge
is primarily responsible for seasonal differences in the
distribution on the kelp plants, and the light gradient is
responsible for the extent of migration on a daily basis.
However, this separation of variables is premature and awaits
more quantitative data on surge and light conditions.
What is the selective advantage for this vertical
movement? Here more research needs to be done. Since
the main predators of Tegula occuring on Macrocystis are
fish and sea otters (Hunt,1977; Vandewere,1969), there
would be an advantage to seeking light levels where the
foraging of such predators would be less effective. At
night, snails could move freely, grazing on the blades
(which is observed at night) only to reseek lower light
levels during the day. The number of snails in the
