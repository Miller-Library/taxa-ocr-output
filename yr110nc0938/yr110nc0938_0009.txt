sporophylls does decrease at night indicating an emergence
into other parts of the plant (this was demonstrated by
movements of marked snails and by an increase in the num¬
ber of snails in the stipes above the sporophylls during
their upward migration). Illustrative experiments would
be those that could demonstrate different predation rates.
Summary
1. T.pulligo exhibits a diel vertical migration on the stipes
of Macrocystis pyrifera.
2. The actual distribution and the extent of migration appear
to be influenced by surge and light conditions in the
kelp forest.
3. Aquarium studies indicate a negative response to light
as well as showing increased activity of T. pulligo
during periods just after dawn and dusk. These obser¬
vations implicate changing light conditions as a cue
for initiation of migration.
