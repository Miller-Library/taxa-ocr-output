Acknowledgments
I extend my thanks to Chip Wright for diving with me
during the first part of the investigation and for some
of the light measurements used in this paper. I cannot
forget all the other people who helped in the diving; a
special thanks to them. Last but not least, in any sense
of the word, is Chuck Baxter, my advisor. I thank him for
the help he gave in proofing this paperand for the help
he gave in getting dive equipment for me.
