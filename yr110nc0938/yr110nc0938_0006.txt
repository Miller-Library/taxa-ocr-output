RxC test shows the distribution to be significantly heter¬
ogeneous over time (G=66.58, n=20, P.005). Observations
on marked individuals during one rising phase showed that
13/17 moved up at least one meter interval, 4/17 were un¬
changed and zero moved down. During two falling phases
19/32 moved down (some as much as three meters), 9/32 were
unchanged and 4/32 moved down.
Aquarium studies (fig.3) show a significant increase
in the mean height at night (t!=4.01) as well as a sig¬
nificant peak of locomotion during the hours immediately
after dawn (t!=2.63). The greatest increase in activity
occurs in the period following sunset.
