Discussion
Field monitoring of T. pulligo in a protected portion
of the Hopkins Marine Station kelp forest reveals a diel
vertical migration on the stipes of Macrocystis pyrifera,
up at night and down during the day. The vertical distri¬
bution and the amount of movement varied, though, through¬
out the investigation.
The distribution was more skewed to the bottom in the
April studies and less in the final field study. This
correlates well with differences in the field conditions.
The ocean was rough and surgey in April and calm in May.
Hunt (1977) reports lower vertical distributions during
months when storms were more prevalent compared to those
months of relative calm. He also mentions increases in
the benthic population of Tegula after storms. It seems
that the action of surge causes attrition, via loss, from
the higher portions of the plant. In the final field
study (fig.2), the mean height rises on successive days
and nights possibly correlating with the lack of surge.
This was a time of virtually no seas and therefore low
attrition (numbers of snails were observed to rise on
individual plants).
A second variable is the light conditions in the kelp
forest. Both the increase in the density of the kelp can¬
opy and the presence of plankton blooms in May caused
visibility to drop and hence light intensity. (Noon readings
on May 9 showed a gradient of approximately 100 ft-candles
