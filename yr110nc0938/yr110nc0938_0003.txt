Methods
A study are was set up near the 130M mark on the per¬
manent transect that runs through the HMS kelp forest in
7-8M of water. Twenty plants were labeled with lettered
plastic tags and used throughout the investigation.
Data was collected by dividing the plant into meter
intervals and tabulating the number of snails in each depth
interval. Care was taken to avoid dislodging any snails
so that the same plants could be monitored for periods of
several days. Night observations were made with a hand¬
held underwater light.
A total of 25 dives were made of approximately 45 min¬
utes each for the purposes of counting snails. These were
between the dates of April 13 and June 2, 1978.
Marked snails were used for one study. This entailed
stripping a plant and bringing the snails to shore where
numbered tags were epoxied to the apex of their shell.
They were released on the same plant within three hours
by placing them in small baskets tied just above the spor¬
ophylls (.3-.4M). 24 hours or more were allowed for the
snails to redistribute themselves on the plant before
further observation was made.
Experiments were also done in an outdoor aquarium
(measuring .92 x.92 x .62M) which contains a kelp plant
constructed of .6M long fronds. Screening was placed over
