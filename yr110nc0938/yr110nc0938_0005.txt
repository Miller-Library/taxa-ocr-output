The distribution of T. pulligo on Macrocystis pyrifera
was found to change significantly over a 24 hour period.
A compilation of field data taken between April 13 and May
(fig.1) showed that 62% of the Tegula population censused
occupied the bottom meter of the plants during the hours
from 0800-1200. The majority being concealed in the dense
sporophylls. At night only 25% of the population was in
this interval; the snails had distributed themselves more
evenly throughout the plant. An RxC test of independence
(Rohlf and Sokal, 1969) comparing the six frequency distri¬
butions in fig.l gave a G-value of 226.64 (with n=25, P(.005).
Therefore one rejects the null hypothesis that the distri¬
bution does not change over the 24 hour period. A compar¬
ison between the two extremes, 0800-1200 and 2000-2400,
was also significant using the same test (G=71.75, n=5,
P .005). The mean height of all the snails on the kelp
plant rose 1.1M on the average over the period of obser¬
vation (t.-8.38).
In a second study which followed the distribution
of marked snails on the same palnts by sampling at noon
and midnight (fig.2), the mean height rose and fell during
night and day respectively, over a 48 hour period. T-tests
for a comparison between two means (Rohlf and Sokal, 1969)
applied to consecutive points and successive noon and mid¬
night observations all prove significant at-.05. The
