(2) Juveniles of P. granosimanus are not clustered together
in large quantities under rocks and algal cover, whereas
the other three species of Pagurus exhibit high population
densities under these conditions.
(3) The data on population in fig. I suggest the following
hypothesis -- any sample with a population iensity
greater than 100 per 0.1 m' will tend to be composed
predominantly of one species.
Pagurus Spp. may be located in terms of i referred
(4)
environment. P. samuelis can oe found in rocky exposed
areas, where P. hirsutiusculus prefers regions with
algal cover. P. granosimanus is found in the pools and
mild surge channels of the midile ind lower intertidil,
where P. hemphillii prefers the deeper witers and
constant surge of the lower intertidal und sibtiiil regions.
The number of Pagurus spp. is reduced in the sibtidal
(5)
region. P. hemphillii is the dominant srecies,
P. granosimanus is found occasionally, with P. sinielis
and P. hirsutiusculus absent entirely in the smill
region studied here
