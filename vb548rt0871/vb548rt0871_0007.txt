P. hirsutiusculus found in the lower area. The presence of
coralline algae in the lower area constitutes the other major
difference in environment. P. hirsutiusculus is usually found in
areas with algal cover, while P. samuelis is predominant in areas
with rocky or sandy bottoms. We concur with Orians and King (1964)
in this observation.
The segregation by species noted above is not an isolated
example. A glance at the first twenty samples listed in fig. 4
finds seven of them with population densities greater than
100 per 0.1 m2, and in each case, the sample is predominantly
one species or another. P. samuelis and P. hirsitiusculus
will not share the same rock or algal cover if the population
density is high, even when they live in close proximity.
The data suggest the following hypothesis: any sample with
a population density greater than 100 per O.1 m will tend to
be composed predominantly of one species.
Differences in substrate and exposure often account for the
relative predominance of juvenile or adult individuals in a
particular area. Juveniles prefer a sheltered environment and
are usually clustered together in large quantities under rocks
or clumped in sandy beds of coralline algae. Siae alone forces the
adult population into more exposed rocky areas, but similar areas
witn algal cover of protective crevices contain higner population
densities. The lowest population densities are found in swift
surge channels or sunny open areas. Several samples with zero
or less than five individuals per O.im2 were taken from the
graveled bottoms of deep pools with no algil cover or protection
of any sort. However, the population density of both juveniles
and adults is usually high at the water's edge, for either a
