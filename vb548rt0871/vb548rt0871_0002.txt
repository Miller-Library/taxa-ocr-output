The hermit crabs Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857),
Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859), Pagurus hemphillii
(Benedict, 1892), and Pagurus hirsutiusculus (Dana, 1651)
occupy a definite distribution by species in the intertidal
area at Mussel Point, California. Prior to making a thorough
ecological study of the four species, it was necessary to
determine their distribution as to the total number of individuals
and the relative predominance of each species under a number
of different ecological conditions.
A survey by Bollay (1964) indicated a definite species
distribution over a 10 meter transect with P. samuelis predom-
inantly in the rocky outcroppings and high pools of the upper
intertidal and P. granosimanus and P. hirsutiusculus gaining
predominance in the deeper channels of the lower intertidal.
The region selected for our survey is larger and encompasses a
greater variety of environmental extremes, including a small
section of the subtidal. Extensive collecticns of the Pagirus
species were made with the objective of determining distribution
of the species present and the factors contributing to their
distribution.
Methods
The area chosen for study (see fig. 1) is 80 meters long and
30 meters wide, extending from the highest to lowest intertidal
areas adjacent to the Hopkins Marine Station. The transect was
laid out by triangulation from two reference points of established
position and height above mean low low water with ai transit
and level rod.
