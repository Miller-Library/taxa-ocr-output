P. granosimanus, while occupying the whole range above -0.65
meters, occurs primarily in the middle heights. Once again,
P. hemphillii and P. samuelis are separated, the former occurring
entirely at the greatest depths and the latter at the greatest
heights, with only a small overlap between the heights of -O.O1
and 0.15 meters, where few of either species are found. The
occurrence of P. hirsutiusculus in the lower intertidal regions
1910
contrasts with Rickett's/statement that only P. hemphillii is
to be found in the low-tide region from O to -0.75 meters.
Figure 8 is a representation of the striking fact that
P. granosimanus juveniles are seldom found in the areis where
the population density is high for the species. This distribution
contrasts sharply with that of P. samelis where the juvenile
population often outnumbers the mature individuals. When the
population densities (n - given species population per O.1 m*)
are compared, it is evident that the P. granosimanus juveniles
are relatively scarce, in fact, practically absent in contrast
to the large number of juveniles taken in the P. samuelis zone.
Environmental factors affecting distribution are intertidal
height and distance from shore, degree of exposure to sun and
current, and the nature of the substrate. Two samples (lc 5, fig.
taken from protected pools close to shore are very similar in
habitat and population density, both sample areas partially shaded
and covered by 15 cm. of water, both with sandy bottoms covered
by broken mussel shells. Yet one sample is composed entirely of
P. samuelis (102 per 0.1 m2), and the other is almost completely
P. hirsutiusculus (152 out of 159 per 0.1 m2) since the two
areas are located only 2Â½ meters apart, the segrecation of species
may be explained in part by the 0.42 meter difference in height,
