Discussion
In figure 5 it can be seen that P. samuelis, P. granosimanus,
and P. hemphillii have distinct horizontal distributions.
P. samuelis is centered around the inner regions of the transect;
P. granosimanus/found primarily in the central portion of tie
transect, an area of pools, rocky bottoms, trenches and crevices
which give some protection against the mild surge found in this
area. P. hemphillii occupies the outermost portions of the
transect, but is found in smaller numbers per 0.1 m'. The
surprising distribution is that of P. hirsutiusculus which can
be found in large numbers throughout the horizontal ixis of the
transect. The next figure should be compared with figs. 1 Â£ 5
to emphasize the abovementioned points.
Figure 6 represents the species composition of the samples
10 meter areas to show
in fig. 4 averaged over
a pattern of doninance in each horizontal area, Again, the same g-
pattern is present -- P. samuelis occurs primarily in the inner
zone, P. granosimanus in the midile, and P. hemphillii in the outer.
P. hirsutiusculus is found throughout, appearing in the samples
with greater frequency as the distance from shore increases.
The E. hemphillii and P. samuelis populations are completely
separated, with few exceptions, and those occur at the edges of
deep pools, (samples 23 % 27). Some mixing might be exjected at
a natural boundary between the deep water hermit crios and their
higher dwelling neighbors.
Vertical distribution is shown in figure 7, and again E.
hirsutiusculus is found throughout the range, although in
smaller numbers above 0.5 meters.
