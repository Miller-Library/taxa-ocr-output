Acknowledgments
We would like to gratefully acknowledge the advice and
assistance of Professors Laurence R. Blinks and Donald P.
Abbott. Thanks to Bill Austin for advice and materials,
to Robert Cook and Jim Landers for photographs and help with
the subtidal region, and to Jack Putnam for uncomplaining
help with the disagreeable task of screening.
