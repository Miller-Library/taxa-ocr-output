as expressed by width of hard carapace and length of entire
carapace. (Table I)
Schmitt's key (1921) served as the basis for identification
of large hermit crabs. Identification of the smaller specimens
was done under a dissecting microscope with a key provided by
Markham (1965). The tabulated data from each sample area were
entered on a segmented disc to show percentage composition by
species, and the number of each disc placed at the appropriate
position on a map of the transect. (figs. 3a-d)
Results
The 51 samples taken contained a total of 2,921 individuals.
The results portrayed in figures 4, 5, Â« 6 show that the species
are differentially distributed with respect to horizontal distance.
Figure 7 illustrates the vertical distribution. Where broad bands
are used in the figures, they represent 90% of the population
given by N, while the narrow lines represent the other 10/.
In figure 8 the adult and juvenile populations of two species
are compared. Ten samples with high population densities were
chosen to represent each species, and the distribution of each
displayed as it was sorted by shell size in the screens. (The
majority of specimens found in screens 5 k 6 were without shells.)
All specimens with a carapace widta of 1.5 mm or greater (screens 1-3
see Table I) are considered mature on the basis f coloration
typical for the species (Markham, 1955), and egg bearing in
the female population (Lamel, 1965).
