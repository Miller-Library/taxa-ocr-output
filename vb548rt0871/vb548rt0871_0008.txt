Further indication of the role of height as a fictor in
distribution is given by the scattered occurrence of P. samuelis
in the outer sections of the transect. All P. simuelis
occurring more than 30 meters from shore were found at a height
of 0.0. maters or greater. Sample 34, which contained the
greatest percentage of P. simuelis in any sample iken past
30 meters, was collected from a height of 0.55 meters, a height
well within tnat containing 90% of the population. Evidently
P. samuelis occupies a definite vert'cal zone vherever it
occurs horizontally in the intertidal.
Ten samples in the subtidal transect yielded 13 P. hemphillii,
1 P. granosimanus, and ten small specimens which have not yet
been identified. The bottom area is covered with large gravel
and rippled by surge, only a few boulders forming protected
pockets for the Pagurus population. Although the sampled area
covered only 2 m2, it was determined by visual inspection and
selected sampling that no hermit crabs are present in the large
gravel surge channels which cover most of this subtidal region.
Sumnary
A survey of the intertidal and subtidal area off Mussel Point
has shoun:
(1) The Pagurus spp. found intertidally occupy definite
horizontal and vertical zones. The inper section of
the middle
the transect contains primarily P.
section P. granosimanus, and the outer regions P. hemphillii,
with P. hirsutiusculus extending over most of the transect.
