A subtidal transect 15 x 3 meters was also selected.
Combined, these transects provide all types of situations avail-
able on a rocky bottom, ranging from an intertidal height of
3 meters to a subtidal depth of -10 meters with raspect to mean
low low water, encompassing all degrees of exposure to air, sun,
currents, and extremes in amount of vegetation.
The sampled areas are selected to be representative of
the different environmental conditions present. Each sample
covers an area of 0.1 meter2, plus or minus 10%, or was corrected
to this value when the results were tabulated. Sampling was
carried out with a shovel and followed by a suction pump until
no Pagurus could be found in the area. A portable submarine
of the type used to tow scuba divers was converted into a suction
pump by restricting the intake to a 4 inch flexible hose and
directing the exhaust into a burlap sack. (fig. 2)
Sampling procedure involved:
(1) Hand collection of the larger or extremely mobile crabs.
(2) Shovel collection of the top 5 centimeters of substrate,
with the exception of rock surfaces.
(3) Suction pump collection of any spilled or
remaining specimens.
(4) Neasurement and description of the sampled area.
Whenever samples were taken above the water line, a cleining
with trowel, brush, or hand was substituted for the (vacuuming)
action of the pump.
Each collected sample was taken to shore and washed through
a series of 6 screens ranging in mesh size from 15.5 x 15.5 mm.
to O.7 X O.7 mm. This separation permitted a study of size
distribution and provided a good correlation with crab size
