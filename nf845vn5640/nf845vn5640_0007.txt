Chemoreception in Myxicola
Next, several tests were done using the arabellid
homogenate to characterize the compound active in causing
Myxicola's withdrawal. A homogenate solution made up of .omg
(wet weight) arabellid plus 6ml filtered sea water was centri-
fuged for 15 minutes at 1500 rpm. Activity was found in both
the clear supernatant (80% at .6% solution conc. - .0216 mg
dry arabellid per ml sea water) and in the sediment (not
quantified).
The homogenate was dialysed in a rotating dialyser for
48 hours at 6°C, using a Spectrapore membrane tubing bag (type
2: m.w. cutoff 12,000-14,000) and five outer volumes. The
inside and outside solutions were freeze-dried and reconsti-
tuted to their original water concentration and osmolarity for
the assay, which showed the chemical to be dialysable (at 1%
dilution, 80% Myxicola reacted to outer solution, 10% reacted
to inner solution).
An assay was also done for heat stability. An arabellid
was dried in an oven for 8 hours at 76°C. and then made into
a solution and centrifuged. The supernatant yielded an 80%
reaction at .8% dilution (=.0245mg dry weight per ml sea
water).
The arabellid homogenate was also tested for stability
against oxidation. 30% H,O, was added in excess to a solution
of .5mg worm per ml sea water, then the H202 was evaporated
and the solution reconstituted. The assay resulted in an 80%
reaction at 1% concentration of solution (- .18m9/ml sea water)
