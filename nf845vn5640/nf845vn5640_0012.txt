ACKNOULEDGMENTS
I would especially like to thank Dr. F.A. Fuhrman
for all his extremely invaluable assistance in this research,
and Dr. Robin Burnett and Chuck Baxter for their encouragement
and criticism. Thanks also to Gordy Kauhanen for helping with
the set-up design, and to the entire class and faculty for
making my experience at Hopkins so terrific.
