Chemoreception in Myxicnla
Myxicola live at the marina in amongst many other in-
vertebrates, some of which are known to concentrate certain
metals in their bodies (Goldberg 1970). A tunicate, Ascidea
ceratodes, is abundant at the marina and concentrates
vanadium in its blood. The scyphistoma stage of Lyanea capitella
has also been seen in the same environment (Abbott 1976) and
concentrates copper (Goldberg 1970). Myxicola's positive
reactions to several dilutions of Ascidea blood might lead
to the possibility of a sympathetic withdrawal due to the sensing
of an injury in a neighboring animal.
The idea of metal sensitivity as a defense against
pollution is another possibility. Several of the metals meas-
ured are known to be toxic to marine invertebrates in higher
concentrations (Portmann 1972). A response to a slight increase
in metal would enable Myxicola to withdraw into its tube in
case dangerous amounts of toxic metals were diffusing through
the water. These ideas are beyond the scope of this project,
however, but any possible adaptive sensitivity would be advan-
tageous for Myxicola's protection and is worth considering.
It is also interesting that homogenates from animals not
from the same environment as Myxicola generally had the same
effect on Myxicola as animals from the same habitat. This
rules out the possibility of the chemoreception being specific
between a predator and prey, and the widespread acivity clearly
eliminates the possibility of the chemical being a species
specific pheromone.
