Chemoreception in Myxicol:
page 11
Since the chemicals had to be applied to the interior
base portion of the branchial croun to be effective in the
assay, it is assumed that the chemoreceptors are located in
this area. This is supported by the fact that nereids have
been found to have chemoreception in their prostomial
cirri (Laverack 1974), which correspond closely to the small
tentacles at the end of Myxicola's prostomium.
Leherally, Myxicola has been shown to be a good, consistant
bioassay for several metals. In addition to responding
immediately to the stimulus, the recovery time is very short.
and accomodation to repeated stimuli is relatively slow.
