Chemoreception in Myxicola
assays in this paper, only rapid and complete withdrawals
were counted as positive.
Tests were done on Myxicola to determine sensitivity to
osmotic and ph changes. The osmotic assay was made using
filtered instant ocean (plus trace metals) at concentrations
of 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, and 200% sea water. Worms were also
tested with distilled water. Withdrawal responses occured
only on application of distilled water, 150% and 200% sea
water.
PH sensitivity was tested at phs of 3,4,6,and 7 using
different dilutions of citric acid; pH 5 with KH,PO,; and
pH 7 and 9 using Na,HPO,. 60%-100% worms were sensitive to
acidic phs (especially citric acid), but less than 20% were
receptive to alkaline pH.
Effects of Animal Homogenates
Homogenates of several invertebrates from both the same
habitat as Myxicola (the marina) and also a different one
(intertidal) were assayed to compare Myxicola's sensitivity
to different animals as well as find out whether the chemical
might be species specific or habitat specific, or possibly
due to a predator-prey situation (see tables 1,2.3).
An observation of a live arabellid specimen with a
Myxicola placed together in a fingerbowl for several minutes
revealed that the withdrawal response was not effected by the
presence of a live arabellid.
