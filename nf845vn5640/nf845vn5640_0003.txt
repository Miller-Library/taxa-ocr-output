Chemoreception in Myxicola
page 3
INTRODUCTION
Myxicola infundibulum is a sedentary tubiculous poly-
chaete which responds to stimulation by rapid withdrawal into
its mucus tube (figure 1). The Myxicola escape response has
been studied in detail (MoIntosh, 1921; Nicol, 1948, 1955;
Roberts, 1962a; Dyal 1972; Binstock and Goldman, 1967, 1969)
and has been found to be an extremely rapid all-or-nothing
contraction mediated through a single giant axon without
synapses and effected by giant muscle fibers running longi-
tudinally through the body.
Studies done on sensory behavior in sabellids have shown
withdrawal responses to tactile stimulation of either the
branchial crown or body wall (Roberts 1962a). The reflex has
also been obtained from changes in light intensity and shadow
movement (Dyal 1972).
Chemoreception has been found in several commensal
polychaetes in locating hosts (Mackie and Grant 1974), as
well as in earthworms (Dyal 1972), and a few errant polychaetes
(Mackie and Grant 1974), but it is interesting to study
Myxicola's extremely keen sensitivity to chemicals and its
use as a possible protection device.
Myxicola is particularly good for bioassay due to its
clear-cut response, quick recovery from withdrawal, as well
as being an easy animal to maintain in the lab.
