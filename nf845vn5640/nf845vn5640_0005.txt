Chemoreception in Myxice

homogenate was tested at three or more 10-fold dilutions of
the initial concentration. The chemicals tested were mixed
in molar concentrations and diluted 10-fold from 10*9 to at
least 102 molar, except where indicated. Applications were
made to interior base of the plume area. The tub water in-
flow was turned off to allow for maximum sensory reception,
and to minimize dilution of chemicals applied. To eliminate
habituation, the worms were tested only once per hour with
six tests at most in a given 24 hour period, in accordance
with previous studies (Evans 1969, Dyal 1972)
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Standardization and Controls
The Myxicola were tested with applications of sea
water and a mixture of sea water and graphite particles to
quantify possible reactions to mechanical stimulus. Fifteen
worms were tried with each solution, with only two contractions
total. It was almost always possible to distinguish this
mechanically-stimulated reaction from a chemical one, however,
since the fine-fibered transverse muscles contract uhen
Myxicola first is mechanically stimulated, causing the worm
to slouly close the end of its branchial crown, and possibly
withdraw partially into its tube. Only if the stimulus is
increased in magnitude will the giant fibers contract, giving
a semi-graded response (Roberts 1962, Dyal 1972). For all
