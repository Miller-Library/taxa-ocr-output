Chemoreception in Myxice

to these chemicals than any others tried so Far.) Myxicola
reacted to several similar metals, but had different degrees
to sensitivity to different metals.
The tunicate with which Myxicola is closely associated
(Ascidea ceratodes) at the marina concentrates vanadium,
(Goldberg 1970) another divalent metal, so a solution of
Ascidea blood and 10-fold dilutions of it were tried (graph 7).
It is interesting to note however, that the solutions of
V2Ug and Batl, were not especially active in eliciting the
Myxicola response.
DISCUSSION
he experimental results clearly show that Myxicola
conclusively employs chemoreception as another means of
sensing the environment. Preliminary tests show the active
compound to be naturally occuring, at least partially free
in solution, fairly small in molecular weight, heat stable.
and stable against oxidation. All these characteristics
readily support the data showing Myxicola's sensitivity
to metal cations. The positive reactions to mixtures of
organic substances can also be explained in this way since
many of the chemicals asaayed (i.e. casein hydrolysate) are
known to contain trace amounts of metals to which Myxicola
is so sensitive. Two possible reasons for this sensitivity
have to do with Myxicola as prey, and Myxicola's adaptation
to a polluted environment.
