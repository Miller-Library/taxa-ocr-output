Chemoreception in Myxicola
page 4
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of Myxicola infundibulum were obtained from
beneath the floats at the Monterey marina. Other invertebrates
Used as homogenates in tests were obtained either at the
marina or from the intertidal region off Hopkins Marine Station.
(see tables 1 and 2). Living animals were kept in running
sea water at 12Â°C. In order to facilitate chemical application.
the Myxicola were placed in 2" lengths of glass tubing.
which were glued vertically to a Lucite base in a grid for-
mation about 14" apart. These tube arrangements were kept
in plastic tubs with about thirty worms per tub (figure 2).
This separated each worm and allowed all branchial crouns to
be faced upward. Several tubs were used to permit rotation
of test-worms, thus preventing fatigue. Worms were kept
in semi-darkness except when testing, where red light was
Used. This eliminated any responses due to change in light
intensity or shadow movements, since Myxicola do not respond
to red light (Dyal 1972). Disposable syringes with 3" pieces
of plastic tubing attached to the ends were used to apply
the chemicals, allowing for exact measurement, slow controlled
application, little mechanical stimulus, and elimination of
the possibility of contamination (figure 3).
Animal homogenates were made using approximately 10Omg
worm (wet weight) per lml glass-fiber filtered sea water in
a mechanically driven Potter-Elvehjem apparatus. Each
