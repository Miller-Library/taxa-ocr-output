Chemoreception in Myxice
page 8
Arabellidae is a family closely related to Lumbriconereis
which has been found to contain nereistoxin' (Deguchi, Nara-
hashi, Haas 1971). The arabellid homogenate was tested on
frog rectus abdominus muscle for any possible inhibition of
the effect of acetyl choline. Several trials yielded no
decrease in the muscle's sensitivity to acetyl choline.
Acetyl choline w as also applied to live Myxicola, as was
carbachol, but both these chemicals failed to elicit the
withdrawal response at concentrations of 1 mg/l0ml sea water!
Effect of Known Chemicals
In the next approach, assays of known chemicals (of
characteristic types) were made in an attempt to find out
what chemical or class of chemicals Myxicola might be sen-
sitive to (tables 4 and 5).
Methylene blue (graph 5) was tested before use as a color-
ing agent in the assay of clear amino acid solutions, but
was found to elicit a reaction in Myxicola at very low con-
centrations. Since zinc chloride is known to be an impurity
in the methylene blue staining solution, it and several
(rauxe)
other transition metals were tried on the Myxicola. Very
clear positive results were obtained at strikingly low con-
centrations of the metals. (Myxicola is much more receptive
nereistoxin is a naturally occuring toxin which blocks
the stimulatory action of acetyl choline on smooth muscle
fiber.
