Abstract
The channeled top snail, Calliostoma canaliculatum, releases a yellow mucous,
called yellow stuff or YS, in response to perturbation and especially attempted predation
from sea stars such as Pycnopodia hellantholdes (Bryan et al., 1997). The source of YS is
the hypobranchial gland. Therefore, anatomical studies of this gland as well as electrical
stimulation experiments, to visualize secretion from this organ, were performed. The
anatomical study divulges the existence of cells that contain numerous large vesicles that
appear to contain yellow stuff. Stimulation of the gland directly as well as other body sites
with an electrode reveals that a one second train of brief shocks with a repeat frequency of
20Hz is sufficient to cause secretion of YS. Stimulated secretion was reversibly abolished
by low Caâ€œ seawater. These stimulation experiments demonstrate that the secretion of YS
is under neuronal control. Finally, from the trends that were visualized in the anatomical
study and from a consideration of the time course of secretion, holocrine secretion is
proposed to be the method by which YS is released from the yellow cells of the
hypobranchial gland.
