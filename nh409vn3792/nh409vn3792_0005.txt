Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
difference between my b value and the higher ones reported
by other authors for different species of sea anemones.
However a low b value for anemones seems quite expected
by me.
SUMMARY
There is a large variation in oxygen consumption rates
for both A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica.
Aerial respiration was found to be two to three times
greater than submerged respiration for both species.
A b value found for A. elegantissima was calculated
to be 0.20. This is quite different from b values for
other anemones and other intertidal invertebrates, but
seems expected.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to thank all the students, faculty and
staff at Hopkins Marine Station for all their help and
support, and give special thanks to Chuck Baxter for
his patient guidance.
