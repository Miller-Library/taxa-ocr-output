Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
anemones were left in running sea water at 12°0.
Measurements were made in a Scholander (1949) type
respirometer with compensating chambers and with a Warburg
respirometer. Volume compensation in the Scholander respir¬
ometer was with oxygen to maintain a constant partial
pressure of oxygen.
Measurements were made in a running sea water bath at
12°C. The running water current moving the chambers and
the ciliary activity of the anemone provided the only
mixing.
Readings were taken every fifteen minutes for four
hours or more. A mean volume change was calculated along
with standard deviation and standard error of the mean.
The b value for the log-log plot of the weight regression
was calculated and tested for significance with the Student's
T test.
Measurements taken over prolonged periods, seventeen
hours, with the Scholander respirometer revealed negligible
changes in the running mean volume change from that during
the first four hours. Blanks run under each set of conditions
showed negligible volume changes.
Both sample and compensating chambers were covered with
aluminum foil for dark conditions. Uncovered glass chambers
were in light at an intensity of sixty foot candles for
the Scholander respirometer and forty foot candles for the
