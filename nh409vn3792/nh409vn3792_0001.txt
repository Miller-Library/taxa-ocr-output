Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
INTRODUCTION
Two sympatric species of Anthopleura are found in the
and
local intertidal which seem to occupy different types of
habitat with some overlap. Anthopleura xanthogrammica
(Brandt, 1835) is generally seen lower in the intertidal
and in more surf swept areas than Anthopleura elegantissima
(Brandt, 1835). Suspecting this habitat difference may
be correlated with metabolic differences, studies of oxygen
consumption of the two species were made. Sassaman and
Mangum (1972) measured the oxygen consumption for Haloclava
producta and Metridium senile and found that Metridium
senile from a higher oxygen environment had a higher oxygen
consumption rate at the s√¥me oxygen concentration at (air
saturation).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All the animals used in this study were taken from the
rocky intertidal area at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California. Several of each of the two species of
Anthopleura were taken from three different tidal levels.
Several A. xanthogrammica were taken from an exposed point
where no A. elegantissima were seen. All anemones were
allowed to settle for at least three days to check for
trauma. During settling and between measurements the
