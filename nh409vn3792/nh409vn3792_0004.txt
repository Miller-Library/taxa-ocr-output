Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
is maintained in approximate equilibrium. This all
indicates that aquatic respiration would be more favorÂ¬
able, but aerial respiration is consistently greater.
The volume of oxygen in the air is forty times greater
than in an equal volume of water and the rate of diffusion
of oxygen is 324,000 times greater in air. Together
these two factors make the supply of oxygen in air to
respiratory tissue more effective, indicating that covering
by the tide limits the anemone's metabolic rate. One
advantage of the preferred habitat of A. xanthogrammica
on surf swept rocks is the presence of super saturated
sea water to enhance metabolic rate.
The log-log plot of weight regression for A. elegantissima
in Graph One reveals a good correlation between the oxygen
consumption rates using the Scholander respirometer and
the Warburg respirometer. The b value was calculated to
consideva
be 0.20 which is significantly different from the O.65
b value found for Metridium senile (Sassaman and Mangum, 1970
and the 0.75 b value found for several other intertidal
invertebrates (Newell, 1970). The low b value indicates
that larger anemones are not dramatically changing the
morphology or physiology of the metabolizing tissue.
The value above zero may be accounted for by some enlargement
of individual cells in larger anemones and for burying of
cells in the larger masses of tissues, thus increasing the
diffusion path for oxygen. I can not account for the
