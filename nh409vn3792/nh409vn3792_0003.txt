Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
Warburg respirometer.
All animals were dryed for twenty four hours to a
constant weight within 0.01 grams (Brafield and Chapman, 1965).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Oxygen consumption rates in ul O/hour/gram dry wt.
under four different conditions for both A. elegantissima
and A. xanthogrammica are organized in Table One. Average
variation for repetitive measurements for single anemones
at different times at an average dark submerged oxygen
consumption rate of 21.5 ul 0/hour/ gram dry wt. was
+ 13.8 ul O/hour/gram dry wt. The variation in the differ-
ence in oxygen consumption rates under different light
conditions, at different tidal levels and between the two
species is as large or larger than the variation in oxygen
consumption rates for a single anemone. Therefore these
differences can not be established with my data.
One point of interest is the increased oxygen consumpÂ¬
tion rates in dry animals vs.submerged animals by a factor
of two or three. When submerged in sea water the anemone
is expanded exposing a greater surface area for exchange.
The partial pressure of oxygen in both air and sea water in
equilibrium with each other should be the same. Since the
anemones run for long periods submerged do not show a progresswe
reduction in respiratory rate it is assumed that the water
