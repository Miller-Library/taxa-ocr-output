Self-fertilization in Botryllus
INTRODUCTION
The phenomenon of self-sterility in Botryllus is maintained
by a dual system. In the synchronous life cycle of the colony,
ovulation precedes the release of sperm by one or two days
(Milkman, 1967) preventing self-fertilization in most cases,
In their natural environment, Botryllus colonies are exposed
to large amounts of sperm released by neighboring colonies.
Cross fertilization occurs rapidly between organisms at
different sexual stages and it is rare for a colony containing
unfertilized eggs to be collected directly from the field. A
second block to self-fertilization, presumably residing in the
diploid maternally derived egg envelope, is also present (Oka
1970, Scofield 1981). This barrier is not absolute, and
gradually breaks down in an isolated colony (approximately one-
half or two days after ovulation, Scofield). With this
breakdown, asynchronous embryonic development is accompanied
by a high frequency of maldevelopment of embryos and failure
of the larvae to complete metamorphosis (Sabbadin 1971),
Ascidian eggs are surrounded by a three-layered envelope.
Within the perivitelline space test cells rest on the ovum itself.
The acellular chorion surrounds the egg and test cells, and is overlai
by flattened follicle cells (figure 1). In previous
experiments, the precise location of the internal barrier to
self-fertilization was not determined because enzymatic and
mechanical techniques did not differentially affect the
different egg layers (Morgan 1923, Rosati 1978). In Botryllus,
the extremely close opposition of the three layers further
complicates any detailed investigation of the exact location
