Self-fertilization in Botryllus
with the use of sterile solutions, sterile glassware and a triple
concentration of penicillin -streptomycin in the wash solution.
Examination of the Barrier to Self-fertility
In the second series of experiments, Botryllus colonies
were divided and their development manipulated until
simultaneous maturation of the gametes was obtained. Four
sets of crosses were run simultaneously: normal (egg) x self
(sperm), dechorionated (egg) x self (sperm), normal (egg) x
cross (sperm), dechorionated (egg)x cross (sperm). Results
for two experiments (A and B) appear in table 2. In experiment
A, there was a higher percentage of fertilization in the
dechorionated (egg) x self (sperm) relative to that seen in
the normal (egg) x self (sperm). The fertilization frequency
for the dechorionated (egg) x self (sperm), on the other hand,
closely parallels that for normal (egg) x cross (sperm) and
dechorionated (egg) x cross (sperm). The low percentage of
normal (egg) x cross (sperm) in experiment B is anomalous and
was not repeated in the dechorionated (egg) x cross (sperm).
Possible reasons for this result are discussed below. However,
these preliminary results suggest that the barrier to self-
fertilization is located in the chorion.
DISCUSSION
This report describes the development of an enzymatic
treatment which selectively removes the chorion and follicle
cells of Botryllus eggs, leaving the test cells and egg plasma
membrane intact. This technique has permitted the investigation
of the barrier to self-fertility in greater detail than was
