Self-sterility in Botryllus

from a neighboring parent or sibling. This suggests that
the fusibility gene locus,or link to it, controls self-sterility
in Botryllus through the diploid, maternally derived test cells
or their products in the chorion. This organization of
genetic locii controlling both histocompatibility and fertilization
is reminiscent of the linkage between the mouse T-complex affecting
spermatogenesis and embryonic development and the H-2 region
which is responsible for producing both the histocompatibility
and immune response (Scofield and Weissman 1980).
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I wish to thank Dr. David Epel for his advice concerning
this project. I would especially like to thank Dr. Virginia
Scofield for her incredible enthusiasm, patience and editing
capabilities. The use of her laboratory facilities and
suggestion for this investigation were critical to its
completion. Keith Kohatsu and Jay Schlumpberger donated
both time and concernand egg pulling aid. Finally,
I would like to acknowledge the support given to me by the
other members of the Hopkins spring class.
