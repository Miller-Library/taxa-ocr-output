Self-fertilization in Botryllus
Amy Levenson
this elusive barrier to self-fertility in colonial tunicates
can now be placed with greater certainty onto the chorion
itself.
The protocol for this investigation was difficult to maintain
successfully to completion. In the above experiments, eggÂ¬
bearing colony pieces were isolated in the cold after ovulation.
For experiments in progress, the timing of temperature
separation of the colony halves has been altered to insure
simultaneous development of the gametes. If mature testes are
placed in the cold environment, the possibility that the barrrier
to self-fertilization has broken down (in the colony kept at
room temperature) at the time of ovulation will be greatly
reduced. Fertilization in vitro will be performed immediately
upon ovulation. Because of the variability of the timing of
the barrier's breakdown the quickest possible removal and
utilization of newly ovulated eggs would prevent self-fertilization
from becoming a source of technical failure.
The phenomenon of self-sterility in Botryllus is of special
immunologic interest because of its close genetic linkage with
the genes controlling the fusion-rejection reaction between
Botryllus colonies. The ampullae of these oozoids actively
fuse or reject with neighboring ampullae indicating some
type of allogeneic recognition (Nagashima, Scofield).
Each individual colony is heterozygotic at one locus determining
fusibility at which there are approximately forty different
alleles. Two colonies must share one allele to fuse. Eggs
of a colony of fusibility genotype AB cannot be fertilized by
A or B sperm, whether they come from the same individual, or
