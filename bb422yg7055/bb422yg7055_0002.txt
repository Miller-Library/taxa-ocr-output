Self-fertilization in Botryllus

of the barrier in this species.
The present work presents a successful new technique
allowing selective dechorionation and removal of follicle cells
of the Botryllus egg. With the aid of this technique the
phenomenon of colonial self-sterility was examined. The
localization of the barrier to self-fertilization in the
chorion or follicle cells is documented with an increased
degree of certainty and detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Colonies ofBotryllus were gathered from beneath the docks
of the Monterey Marina during the months of April and May.
Individual colonies were separated and placed in 700 ml.
glass beakers with approximately 600 ml. filtered sea water
at room temperature (20Â° C) with a constant source of aeration.
The containers were washed with a 1% solution of 7x detergent
(Linbro) and refilled daily. Eggs were removed from the
adult by means of a slit between the oral and atrial siphons
and gentle pressure on the tunic. Colonies were categorized
according to their degree of embryonic development and monitored
for hatching and ovulation.
Dechorionation
Eggs were pipetted from the atrial cavity of Botryllus
and placed in polypropylene dishes (PolyCons, Cole-Parmer
Plastics), in which they were washed three times in filtered
sea water. One drop/three milliliters of penicillin-streptomycin
