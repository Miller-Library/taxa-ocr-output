Self-fertilization in Botryllus

possible in earlier studies (Morgan 1923, Rosati 1978), and
has allowed its tentative assignment to the chorion.
Dechorionation of the ascidian egg is useful for many
experimental procedures concerning the embryo. Difficulties
encountered in separating and removing the closely associated
layers of the egg envelope have limited experimental work
on colonial ascidian development. The dechorionation procedure
presented here creates a highly efficient means of attaining
a large number of dechorionated eggs for experimentation. It
is also unique in that it allows selective removal of the chorion.
The finding that cellulase removes the Botryllus chorion
also provides an unexpected insight into the structural nature
of the egg envelopes; the egg apparently resides in its own
tunic, even before development begins. The increased susceptibility
of dechorionated eggs to contamination also opens speculation
concerning the function of this extra-embryonic layer.
Seemingly, the chorion occupies an important role in the creation
of a highly protected structure which will allow the embryc
to successfully grow and develop freed from the hazards of a
non-sterile, and often hostile, environment. Since removal
of the chorion and attached follicle cells by this technique
increases fertilization frequency for eggs fertilized by self
sperm (table 2- A), it appears that one of these layers contains
the structural elements which block self-fertilization. The
finding by Rosati (1978) that follicle cell removal does not
affect self-fertilization in Ciona intestinalis eliminates
their participation in the block to selfing. The location of
