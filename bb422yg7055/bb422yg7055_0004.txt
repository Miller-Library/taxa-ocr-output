Self-fertilization in Botryllus

was then loosely covered with aluminum foil and placed in a
moisture chamber. After approximately four hours first
cleavages could be observed.
Self-fertilization
Immediately upon release of larvae, colonies were divided
in half. At this time, eggs are maturing in the new adult
zooids from the second generation buds. One half of each
colony was stored at 15Â° C to slow the breakdown of the
egg's internal barrier to self-fertilization. The other half
was left undisturbed at room temperature to develop mature
testes. When the testes of the colony held at room temperature
contained mature sperm, the fertilization protocol was followed.
RESULTS
Dechorionation of Eggs with Cellulase
In the first series of experiments, unfertilized Botryllus
eggs were dechorionated enzymatically with a combination of
cellulase and protease. The chorion and overlaying follicle
cells were selectively removed, leaving the test cells and
the egg plasma membrane intact (figure 3). To verify the
success of this unique treatment, fertilization of the
dechorionated eggs and an untreated control were simultaneously
undertaken. Experimental results indicate that the percentage
fertilization was not significantly different between treated
and untreated eggs (table 1). Dechorionated eggs, however,
were much more susceptible to contamination, necessitating
the modification of a normal fertilization protocol (Scofield)
