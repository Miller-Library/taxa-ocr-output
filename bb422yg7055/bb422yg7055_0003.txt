Self-fertilization in Botryllus
solution (5000U/m1/5000 g/ml) was added to the culture if not
used immediately. The filtered sea water was aspirated off
and a 1% solution of cellulase (Sigma no. C-7377) added for
three hours. (All solutions were made in filtered sea water
with o.5 M TRIS buffer (pH 9.1) to pH 6.8 and sterilized with
a millipore filter.) The cellulase solution was then aspirated
off and replaced in successive five minute intervals by a 0.5%
solution of protease (Sigma no. P-5130), a 2% solution of
bovine serum albumin (Sigma no. A-4503) and a 0.5% solution
of bovine serum albumin. The eggs were then washed three
times in filtered sea water with a triple concentration of
penicillin-streptomycin (figure 2).
Fertilization
Approximately ten testes were removed from the atrial cavities
of Botryllus colonies and collected in a PolyCon dish. The
testes were washed three times in filtered sea water (with
one drop/three milliliters of penicillin streptomycin added
to the culture) and refrigerated at approximately 4Â° C. An
appropriate number of eggs were also removed and washed. In
a sterile depression dish, one drop of penicillin-streptomycin
solution was added to 25-50 microliters of sterile filtered
sea water. The testes were then transferred to the depression
dish and were gently teased apart. The resulting suspension
was triturated several seconds in the pipette to evenly
distribute the sperm. Eggs were next gathered in a pasteur
pipette and allowed to sink to the tip. The eggs were carefully
trans ferred onto the top of the sperm solution in two to three
drops (total volume approximately 100 ml.) The depression dish
