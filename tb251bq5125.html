Intertidal organisms experience two extreme environmental con¬
ditions that oscillate regularly and predictably with the tides. Ex-
posure presents several dangers: desiccation, predation, osmotic stress
in the form of rain, and wide temperature fluctuation. In contrast, sub¬
mersion necessitates coping with different predators and wave shock
while attempting to feed. Though these changes are drastic, their time
course constitutes a schedule to which adaptation may be selectively ad¬
vantageous. Animals with predictive endogenous tidal clocks can ready
themselves for changes in conditions and can avoid inappropriate activ¬
ity when exogenous cues are ambiguous.
Adaptations in the form of tidal rhythms are expressed in several
marine and maritime species as indicated by studies of the crabs <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Carcinus maenas : Exact'>Car-
cinus maenas</span> (Naylor, 1958) and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Uca pugnax : Exact'>Uca pugnax</span> (Brown, Brown, Webb, Bennett,
and Shriner, 1956) and the isopod <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Excirolana chiltoni : Exact'>Excirolana chiltoni</span> (Enright, 1972),
among others. Documented tidal rhythms in sessile organisms are not as
common, although <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>Mytilus californianus</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus edulis : Exact'>Mytilus edulis</span> have been
shown to possess a filtration rate rhythm (Rao, 1954). Feeding activ¬
ity in intertidal organisms could understandably be aided by endogenous
tidal rhythms, which would allow the animals to capitalize on the pre¬
dictability of a food supply provided by the rising tide.
Circatidal feeding rhythms in two intertidal barnacles, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus dalli : Exact'>Chthamalus
dalli</span> (Darwin, 1854) and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus fissus : Exact'>Chthamalus fissus</span> (Pilsbry, 1916), are docu-
mented in the present paper. Under constant conditions these barnacles
show higher feeding activity at high tide and lower activity at low
tide. Results are presented as evidence for the rhythm and as indica¬
tions of factors having an effect on the rhythm, such as vibration and
habitat differences.
Carlson/Roux-2
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General. Animals were collected from two sites within the rocky
intertidal of Mussel Point, Monterey Bay, California. Site one, a
steep rocky area with a western exposure, was subject to considerable
surge and splash. In contrast, site two had an eastern exposure and
was generally calm.
Populations of 1007 Chthamalus dalli, recognizable in the field by
their wide oval opercular orifices and brown opercular plates (Dr. Eu¬
gene Haderlie, personal communication), were obtained on the shells of
mussels (Mytilus californianus) collected at +3 feet above mean lower
low water (MLLW) from-site one. The mussels were killed and their
tissues removed from their shells and discarded. Populations from site
two were obtained between +3 and +3.5 feet above MLLW by chipping off
approximately 5x5 cm pieces of the granite substratum. These popula¬
tions included a mix of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dalli</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. fissus,</span> with C. fissus consti-
tuting 80% or more of the populations. C. fissus was easily recogniz¬
able in the field by its characteristic slitlike opercular opening and
grey shell (Haderlie, personal communication). Collections were always
made during low tide. Those animals observed under constant submersion
were put into experimental conditions at approximately the time when
they normally would have been first covered by the incoming tide.
Temperature and changes in light intensity have been shown to in¬
fluence feeding in barnacles (Southward and Crisp, 1961, 1965). These
parameters were therefore kept constant at 13°C and 14 milliEinsteins
respectively, using a Forma Scientific model room-36 temperature con¬
trolled room and self-contained light source. In one study animals
were kept in a Lab-Line incubator with a flourescent light source. The
temperature varied between 11.5 C and 13.5'C for this experiment. Ex¬
cept for the experimental group upon which the effects of reversing the
Carlson/Roux-3
normal exposure/submersion regime of the animals were studied, and
those groups upon which the effects of currents were studied, all groups
were submerged in still sea water.
Two methods were used to measure feeding activity. Method A was
to enter the cold room and make counts visually with a hand-held mag-
nifying glass. Method B was to record the animals' activity using a
Sanyo Model + VC 1130 video tape camera and a Sanyo Model #VCord II
video tape player/recorder and to subsequently analyze the tape. A
20 mm Bolex extension tube was used to increase the magnificaion of the
camera. Both counting methods offered certain advantages. With
method A, we had a larger field of view and could therefore assess the
activity of a larger population. Method B offered the advantage that
we could record the activity of the barnacles and later have an un¬
biased researcher, without knowledge of the state of the tide at the
time of the reading, make the counts. Such a strategy of analysis re¬
duced the effect of reasearcher subjectivity. The videotape afforded
better magnification than the magnifying glass and was therefore better
suited for studying individual <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus : Exact'>Chthamalus.</span> The counting method used is
indicated along with the results of each study. An animal was scored
as actively feeding if the cirri moved out of the operculum during ob¬
servation.
Demonstration of an Endogenous Feeding Rhythm. Temporal fluctua-
tions in feeding during conditions of constant submersion in calm water
were documented and characterized by placing the barnacles, C. dalli,
on a plastic stand within a 4 liter beaker of sea water such that the
animals were approximately 4 cm from the surface. Counts of the number
of animals feeding were made every 3 hours for 80 hours. This experi¬
ment was repeated using filtered sea water instead of plain sea water.
Carlson/Roux-4
Effects of Reversing the Normal Tidal Regime. In the laboratory,
a population of C. dalli was subjected to a reversed exposure/submer¬
gence regime. The barnacles were submerged in a 165 x5 cm circular
finger bowl for 6.2 hours during the time of actual low tide and then
exposed for the 6.2 hours centered around the time of actual high tide.
This cycle was repeated for two tidal cycles, approximately 50 hours,
after which the barnacles were placed back in the finger bowl under
conditions of constant submergence, light intensity, and temperature.
Feeding activity was assessed every three hours for 36 hours.
Carlson/Roux-5
Effects of Mechanical Stimulation, Vibration, and Current
Efforts were made to reduce the vibration experienced by the experimen¬
tal populations to a minimum. To dampen out vibration, the table upon
which the cold room set ups were maintained was mounted on four heavy
gage foam rubber pads (l6xl6x5 cm). In the incubator experiment the
door was not opened during the entire experiment. Foot traffic in
the vicinity of the cold room and incubator was kept to a minimum.
Even with these efforts there were variations in the amount of vi¬
bration experienced by the experimental populations due to locational
differences as well as positional differences on the same table.
The relative intensity of vibration experienced by each popula¬
tion was ranked. In the cold room this was done at the end of the ex¬
periment by having two imparfial witnesses visually rank the intensity
of ripples seen on the water surface in each finger bowl or flask when
one of us stomped hard in the middle of the cold room floor. We were
the only ones to enter the cold room during the course of these experi¬
ments and did so one at a time. In the incubator experiment, the air¬
mix fan produced a fairly constant low intensity, high frequency vi¬
bration.
To test the effect of current on feeding activity a stirring rod
with plastic paddle on the bottom was suspended from and rotated by a
small motor mounted on a ring stand. The current-producing paddle was
inserted in a submerged conical compartment with baffles that directed
a smooth lamilar current up the sides of the 4 liter beaker and back
down into the conical compartment. The paddle rotated at 60 rev/min
(Figure 7). A food supply (diatoms in sea water solution) was
dripped into the beaker through a capillary tube at the rate of 5.0510
cells/min (=.5 ml/min). Water was siphoned out of the beaker at the
same rate via another capillary tube.
Carlson/Roux-6
The methods for the constant condition experiments with C. dalli
have been mentioned. Identical experiments were conducted with C.
fissus, the only difference being that the plain sea water experiment
was performed in the incubator rather than the cold room.
Individuals. Our first analysis of individuals was done on 10
barnacles, 9 C. fissus and 1 C. dalli collected from site two. These
animals were analyzed for activity/ non activity and for number of
feeding movements per minute. Counts were made for one minute on the
hour for 18 hours.
A second survey of feeding activity in individuals was undertaken
again using animals from site two. Feeding of 4 C. dalli and 5 C.
fissus kept under constant conditions in filtered sea water was scored
at periods corresponding to high and low tides. The animals were
scored as either active or inactive for the first 10 seconds of each
of the first five minutes starting at and just following high and low
tides.
RESULT!
Demonstration of an Endogenous Feeding Rhythm. The results of
the 80 hour continuous study are shown in Figure 1. The percent of the
population feeding ranges from a low of 07 (12:36 a.m.,5/29) to a high
of 55% (10:36a.m.,5/31). Chi-square tests comparing the summed popu¬
lation frequency feeding (instantaneous number feeding) during read¬
ings corresponding to the exact times of high tides with readings
corresponding to the exact times of low tide shows significant differ¬
ences (P—.005). The period of the oscillation is approximately 12
hours. Counting was by method A.
Effects of Reversing Tidal Regime. Figure 2 shows the graph of
the population receiving a reversed exposure/submergence regime and
compares it with the population that received no change in schedule.
Carlson/Roux-7
The Chi-square test shows significantly higher activity (Ps.005) dur¬
ing periods when the barnacles would have been submerged had the re¬
versed schedule been continued. The two curves are near inverses of
eachother. Counting was by method A.
Effects of Mechanical Stimulation, Vibration, and Current.
Table I relates the quality (amplitude and regularity) of rhythm with
amount of vibration undergone during experimentation. A general trend
is indicated, clearest rhythms having received the least vibration.
Figure 3 shows the results of an experiment testing current
effects. Chi-square test shows differences between high and low tides
to be insignificant. Extremes of activity ranged from 727 to 977.
which is an elevated range in relation to other experiments. Counting
method B was used here.
Species Differences. Figure 4 compares a population of C. dalli
with a mixed population of 807 C. fissus and 207 C. dalli. (The mixed
population was tested in the incubator using method B, C. dalli in the
cold room using method A). C. dalli shows a more distinct rhythmicity
than the mixed population. A second comparison is made in Figure 5.
Method A was used to count both populations. These experimental popu¬
lations were under identical conditions, this time in filtered sea
water. Again, the rhythm is clearer and more persistent in C. dalli.
Individuals. Throughout the first analysis of individuals all of
the subjects analyzed were active during all readings. However, it
must be noted that we observed them for a full minute and did not break
that minute into segments. Therefore, an animal active for 60 seconds
was scored the same as one active for 10 seconds. Graphs of the rate of
cirral extension also failed to give evidence of any periodicity (Fig.6).
Table 2 gives the results of the second analysis of individuals.
Carlson/Roux-8
Animals 3,4,5, and 6, all C. dalli, were generally active under con¬
stant conditions during hightide periods while animals 1,2,7,8, and 9,
are much less predictable. This result is in agreement with data from
whole populations. Animals 4,5, and 6, all C. dalli, were densely
packed neighbors and to a large extent their behavior was synchronous.
The same is true of animals 7 and 8, both C. fissus.
DISCUSSION
A circatidal feeding rhythm, which continued undiminished for the
80 hour experiment under constant conditions, was found in Chthamalus.
Using the preliminary phase of a periodogram analysis (Enright 1965),
i.e. by finding a period which maximizes variance, we estimated the
period to be between 11.5 and 12.5 hours. Several free runs under con¬
stant conditions indicate that the period may be slightly less than 12
hours. Exact determination of the period will require further experi¬
mentation where feeding activity is monitored continuously rather than
at 3 hour intervals as was done in this study.
Not all of the data presented support the correspondence of feeding
and high tide. In Figure 1 both plots have periods of presumptive low
tide where a high percentage of animals are feeding. The plot for the
filtered sea water experiment also has a period of presumptive high
tide with a low percentage of animals feeding. These two experiments
were carried out simultaneously in adjacent areas, about 4 inches
apart. At 12:20 p.m., May 30, the cold room was entered to adjust the
apparatus for the filtered sea water experiment. It is possible that
the discrepancies in data are the results of perturbations which
occurred at this time. One should note that the oscillations are irreg¬
ular for about 1.5 periods just after 12:20 p.m.,May 30, but that the
"correct" feeding/tidal relation soon returns and persists throughout
Carlson/Roux-9
the experiment (3 periods).
After reversing the periods of exposure and of submergence there
was a phase shift in the feeding rhythm of a population of C. dalli.
What cue was responsible for this induced phase shift is not yet known.
We and others (Crisp and Southward, 1961) have shown that currents do
strongly affect the feeding behavior of barnacles. In our studies it
has also become apparent that vibration may have a profound effect on
feeding behavior. It is possible that current and vibration consfitute
the same stimulus to a barnacle. These two factors and the state of
being submerged stand out as the most probable factors involved in the
entrainment of this rhythm. All three of these factors were present
at the appropriate times in the reversal experiment. Further experi¬
mentation is required to determine which factor(s) was (were) respon¬
sible for the phase shift observed.
Our results (Figures 4 and 5) suggest that there are species¬
specific differences in the rhythmicity of feeding for C. dalli and C.
fissus. However, it must be pointed out that all of the C. fissus in
the study were obtained from site two, which differed radically from
site one in physical characterisfics (see Materials and Methods).
Furthermore, some C. dalli individuals from site two did not reflect
the rhythm. The apparent difference in behavior between C. dalli and
C. fissus could in fact be a reflection of a difference in the habitats
from which the animals were collected. Transplantation experiments
where C. fissus individuals are moved to site one and C. dalli indivi-
duals moved from site one to site two with subsequent analysis of
rhythmicity may ultimately give an answer to this question.
Not only does there appear to be a species difference in the ex¬
pression of this tidal rhythm, but individual differences are also
apparent. The data of Figure 6 show that individual variation in time
and rate of feeding can be great and may make resolution of the rhythm
Carlson/Roux-10
difficult except at the population level.
Results of the second analysis of individuals indicate that
neighboring barnacles are similar in the time course of their be¬
havior. The implication here is that there is a group effect, that
neighbors may affect one another's behavior. This possibility is also
suggested by the observation that often there are'islands' of near syn¬
chronous activity within a large population under constant conditions.
We found that the species we studied, C. dalli and C. fissus, are very
sensitive to even weak currents. The group effect described could re¬
flect a phenomenon where the currents produced by an animal's cirral
activity prompt its neighbors to feed.
Generally, experimenters working with barnacles store and observe
the animals in environments where fresh sea water is continually pro¬
vided and some sort of aeration system is present to insure sufficient
oxygen tension. The introduction of water and the aeration process
produce water currents and vibrations. Even low levels of such mechan¬
ical stimulations may override or otherwise change a tidal rhythm, as
shown in this study and by others (Enright, 1965). Therefore, it is
not surprising that this tidal rhythm has not been previously dis-
covered. Southward and Crisp (1965) analyzed several species of barn¬
acles under conditions of constant temperature and low illumination
for activity rhythms in feeding. They did detect semi-regular oscilla¬
tions between feeding activity and inactivity. However, in no species
was this oscillation shown to exhibit correlation with the tidal cycle,
the only exception being a single specimen of <span style='background-color:grey' title='Elminus modestus : Fuzzy'>Eliminus modestus</span> which
showed an increase in activity just prior to high water as one would
expect if tidal periodicity was a factor in behavior. It is interest-
ing to note that Southward and Crisp analyzed only deep water barnacles
Carlson/Roux-11
in still water. The only two intertidal barnacles examined in their
study, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus cariosus : Exact'>Balanus cariosus</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tetraclita squamosa : Exact'>Tetraclita squamosa,</span> were maintained in
moving water. One would not expect a tidal rhythm to be adaptive for a
deep water barnacle and it appears that the experimental conditions were
inappropriate to detect a rhythm in the intertidal species examined.
It is suggested that for the species studied an endogenous
tidal rhythm would be of greater advantage for feeding than an opening
response to being wetted. Attempting to feed on matter delivered by
exceptionally high splash could result in the loss of reserve internal
moisture should an animal repeat extension of the cirri after the water
recedes. Also, moistening by rain water would be harmful if the barn¬
acle responded by attempting to feed. Alternatively, physiological
preparation for a time when the animal would be submerged for several
hours would reduce the risk of desiccation and perhaps conserve energy
and materials.
Though further experimentation is needed to determine the reason
or reasons for differences observed between species and/or locations,
the higher variability of the exposed environment of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dalli may</span>
account for a more tightly regulated rhythm. Because there is more
chance of an exceptional wave during periods of exposure it is likely
that mechanisms have evolved to optimize feeding ability during the
more dependable periods of submergence.
The rigidity imposed by fixed locations may influence tidal
rhythms in animals like barnacles, which experience the regularity
and severity of the tides with greater consistency than mobile organ¬
isms. It seems likely that sessile animals would develop more finely
tuned rhythms because of limitations of other methods of coping with the
environment.
Further experimentation with various sessile intertidal organisms.
Carlson/Roux-12
(other barnacles, tunicates, sponges, hydrozoa, colonial worms, etc.),
may reveal existence of other tidal rhythms,
SUMMARY
1. Experiments conducted at Hopkins Marine Station, Mussel Point,
Monterey Bay, California, have revealed that the intertidal barnacles
Chthamalus dalli and Chthamalus fissus exhibit tidal feeding rhythms
under conditions of constant temperature , constant light and constant
submersion.
2. For both species of barnacle, the period of the rhythm is between
11.5 and 12.5 hours.
3. It appears that C. dalli shows a clearer rhythm than C. fissus.
However, this has yet to be ascertained unequivocally and could be a
product of differences in collection sites.
4. Vibration, water currents, water volume and temperature are fac¬
tors which can modify the character of the feeding rhythms.
5. The phase of the rhythm can be shifted by experimentally reversing
the time course of the periods of exposure and submersion.
6. Clearest and most persistent rhythmicity was observed with maximum
water volume and mimimum vibration,
