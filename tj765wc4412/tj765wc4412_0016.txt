TAXIS AFTER EXTENDED PERTODS
PHC
LIGHT AND DARK ADAPTTON
In the area from which the test snails were obtained, L. plana
can be found both on dry rocks anditidepools. To test for any
difference in phototaxis samples collected from both locations
were kept in toth constant light and dark conditions for periods
up to four weeks. All tests were conducted under approximately one
foot of water in a standard l'x2' aquarium. A suspension of India
ink was added to the sea water in the tank and a 200 watt bulb
and rheostat at one end provided the light source. These conditions
esteblished a good light gradient ranging from 10 fcp at the bright
end to lfop in the middle. For each test 10 snails were placed
facing random directions in the center of the tank. After two hour-
the tank was drained and the direction of crawling established by
examining the carbon-dyed mucus trail. In each case 10 snails were
tested, however only the paths of the active snails are reporte
here.
Snails from tidepools. Of the snails tested immediately after
au were
collection, 7 were photopositive, 2 relatively indifferent (see Fig. 5).
After 24 hours of constant light conditioning, both the light- and
dark-adapted snails were photopositive without exception (see Fig. 6).
Both light- and dark-adapted snails were tested every 48 hours and
were, without exception, photopositive. On the 18th day, five of
the dark-conditioned snails suddenly became photonegative, one re-
mained photopositive. Of the light-conditioned snails, all 7 active
snails were photonegative. Both the light- and dark-adapted groups
