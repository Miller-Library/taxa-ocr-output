had been entirely photopositive when tested on the l√∂th day. Both
groups remained photonegative until the experiment was terminated
10 days later.
Snails from drx rocks. 20 k. planaris were collected from
dry rocks and immediately tested. 14 of these were photonegative,
3 were relatively insensitive. After 24 hours of either light-
or dark-adaption all were found to be photonegative. There is now
further evidence that 24 hoursjconstant environment not only "stabilizes
negative phototaxis, but actually strengthens it. Snails collected
in the field and negativejgeotactic will crawl slowly upwards even
when illuminated from above. After 24 hours of dark-adaption the
same snail will crawl downward, although their negative geotaxis
has not changed (Klabunde, 1964) unpubitsheu). Both the light- and
lark-adapted snails were then tested every 48 hours and no reversal
of phototaxis was observed. All remained nagatively phototacti-
for the three weeks the tests were continued.
In only one case were L. planaxis collected from dry rocks
esifvely
ever observed to be phototactic. 10 snails were kept entirely
submerged in sea water under normal light conditions in the labors-
tory. Tested after four weeks of submersion, 7 were photopositive
and 3 moved across the beam of light. None were photonegative.

This is approximately the disteibutien that would be expected from
snails found in tidepools.
The same apparatus was also used to test phototaxis of uni-
laterally and totally blinded snails. 8 L. planaxis from a tidepoo.
and 6 from thre dry rocks were dark-adapted for 24 hours and anesthetized
