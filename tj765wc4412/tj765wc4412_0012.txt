To test whether an active incresse or decrease of light
intensity is necessary for a change in rate of orawl, fifty snails
were dark-adapted for 24 hours and then divided into two groups of
25 each. One group was tested in the laboratory, the other in bright
sunlight. The results are summarized in Table 3.
Thus it can be seen that L. planaxis behaves orthokinetically,
increasing both its rate of forward crawling and rate of turning at
higher light intensities. This reaction may be partly responsible
for the clustering effect noted in both L. littorea (Newell, 1956
and L. planaxis (Miyemoto, 1964) unpublished).
As pointed out by Fraenkel and Gunn (1940), the eventu-
result of any orthokinetic and klinokinetic movement serves toking
the animal to an area of lower light intensity.
It is interesting to note that L. planaxis moves at less than
one-half the rate reported for L. littorea. Under no conditions was
observed
and
a snail/to move faster than 4 cm. per minute,, This rate was only
approached by one snail at maximum light intensity.
TENTACLE WITHDRAWAL RESPONSE
Both L. planaxis and L. scutulata respond to a sudden dacrease
in light intensity by a rapid but comparatively short withdrawal
into their shell. Upon closer examination it was observed that
this withdrawal is only partial, the foot remaining in contact with
the substrate. Parker (1911) reported that locomotion in several
types of gastropods is accomplished by two separate mechanisms;
simple adhesion of mucus during forward motion, and actual suction
when any force is exerted on the shell. To test whether this with-
drawal reponse involves a change from one mechanism to another,
