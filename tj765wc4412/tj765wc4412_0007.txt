snsils at right angles to it (Charles, 1961). To test this, light
from a 150 watt spotlight placed horizontally was reflected down-
ward by a mirror and the trails of 20 snails recorded and measured
to the nearest 2 under this arrangement. Examination with a polariged
filter showed weak but definite polarization of the reflected light.
The results are plotted on a polar graph with the 0-180 axis
figure
describing the plane of polsrization (gr√•ph 4). L. planaxis, being
photonegative, oriented as would be expected along the plane of polari-
zation. The two snails that were crawling at right angles to this
plane were then tested with artificial light from the side. They
were photonegative. The control group of 20 snails was tested with
nonpolarized light from above adjusted to the same intensity (500 fc).
These snails did not move in any one direction long enough to enable
the determination of a prefered orientation.
Though a great many more snails would have to be tested in order
to fully establish the nature of this orientation, one other experiment
also indicated a sensitivity to polarized light. L. planaxis anesthe-
tized in an isotonic MgCl, solution for one hour and then unilaterally
blinded by the cauterization of the right eye invariably went into
"circus movement" (Fraenkel and Gunn, 1940) toward the blinded
side when illuminated by artificial light from above. Similar
treatment brought no effect upon snail illuminated from above by
light shining through a polaroid filter. The same lack of circus
movement in polarized light has also been recorded in L. littoralis.
