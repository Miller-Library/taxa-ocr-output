Recent investigations havereported some interesting, species-
specific differences in the phototactic and photokinetic responses
of British Littorina (Newell, 1958; Charles, 1961). It was decided
to study these reactions in one of the two Littorines common to

the American west coast. L. planaxis was chosen because of its
greater size and availability. The following observationsare a
selection of many that were made during the period April 25 to

RESPONSES TO SUNLIGHT
L. planaxis collected from horizontal rock surfaces and
placed on a damp glass plate in direct sunlight invariably begin
to crawl in one of two general directions. The paths of 79 snails
were recorded and measured to the nearest 5 (grh 1). Since the
surface of the glass is featureless, this suggests that the snails
are orienting in some way to the sun itself. To test this supposi-
tion the glass plate upon which a snail was actively crawling toward
the sun was rotated 180. The snail also proceeded to turn 180
and again moved in the same direction as before rotation. The
same experiment was then repeated with snails moving in various
directions and in each case the snail turned 180 and moved in a
direction approximately parallel to its original one.
It has been suggested that this orientation is due to a type
of "light compass reaction" in which certain directions along the
