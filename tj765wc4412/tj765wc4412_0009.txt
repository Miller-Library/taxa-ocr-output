VARIATION IN RATE OF CRAWLING AND
TURNING IN DIFFERENT LICHT INTENSITIES
Individual snails collected from horizontal rocks and dark-
adapted for 24 hours were tested on a glass plate for rate of turning
under varying light intensities. The light source consisted of two
150 watt spotlights from above shining through a 3" water filter.
The position of the snail was marked on the glass plate itself at
one-half minute intervals and the rate of change in direction determined
upon later examination of the mucus trails by measuring the angle
of deviation from the snail's proceeding straight path. Both right
and left turns were assigned positive values. The results are
summarized in Table 1. While the threshold for increased rate of
turning seems to vary (see results at 350 fc), all show a greatly
increased rate of turning at 1000 fc.
The same apparatus was now modified by the addition of a
25 watt light at one end of the glass plate. The snails would now
immediately move in the opposite direction. The speed of each snail
was recorded at one minute intervals by marking the glass itself. The
overhead light was switched on at 8 minutes; (see Table 2 below.)
The average speed of all 10 snails is presented for each
minute in graph 1. Immediately after the overhead light was turned
on, there was an initial reduction in the rate of crawl between 8
and 9 minutes, and a rapid increase between 9 and 10 minutes. This
reaction was consistent in 9 out of the 10 snails tested. There
wes
seemed te be no tendency to return to the original speed after
the first few minutes of higher light intensity.
