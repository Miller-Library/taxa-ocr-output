snail was placed on a plexiglass plate with a minute hole filled
with water drilled in it. As the snail erawled over the hole, a
bright light from above was switched off. Air bubbles were now
observed to rise in the hole, indicating an increase in suction as
the tentacles and head retracted. This was observed only for a
sudden but relatively small decrease in light intensity. Rapid
increases in light intensity brought no similar reaction, although
the sharp decrease in the rate of crawling as an overhead light
is switched on (see graph 1) indicates that the snail is not entirel,
unaffected by sharp increases in light intensity.
SENSITIVITY TO VARTOUS WAVE LENGTHS
While the tentacle withdrawal response to decreased light
is consistent with newly collected snails, the response quickly-
diminishes upon repeated trial. This rate of fatigue or adaptation
was used to test the color sensitivity of the L. planaxis eye,
or at least the color specificity of this response. Snails were
illuminated from below by a 150 watt spotlight controlled by a
rheostat. The snail was allowed to crawl on a glass plate placed
over Corning glass filter. Light was focused on the filter by a
water lens also serving as a heat filter. A second rheostat controlled
25 watt bulb also placed below the filter. This supplied enough
light to observe the snail's reaction as the main light source
was switched off.
One red, one green, and two blue filters were tested, as
well as a "control" with normal white light. In every case the
intensities were equilibrated by varying the intensitjes of the
