rays of the sun are prefered (Newell, 1945). However, L. planaxis
from horizontal surfaces tested in the laboratory by illumination
from the side proved to be entirely photonegative. Of the more than
50 snails tested, not one was observed to move toward the light
for more than a short distance before turning. Thus while a limited
light compass reaction may be responsible for the orientation of
L. littorea, where each snail can be either photopositive or photo-
negative, it does not explain the observed distribution of the
ntirely photonegative species, L. planaxis.
Mitsukuri (1901) reported that the Japanese snail, L. exigus
was also photonegative under normal conditions and that this effect
would serve to drive the snails away from the sea. To test this,
the tracks of 23 snails were measured on a glass plate placed
at the water's edge on beaches facing in two different directions
from the sun. The observations (figures 2,3) are admittedly insuf-
ficient to state conclusively whether the snails are orienting
to the sun or to the sea, but an obvious predominance in the direction
away from the se, as would be expected from Mitsukuri's explanation,
was not observed.
There remained the possibility that L. plansxis was orienting
in some way to the polarized light in the sky. This type of orienta-
tion has already been described for L. littorea, L. saxatalis, L.
littoralis, and L. neritodies, where it was shown that these snails
can orient to polsrized light by means of the intensity differences
based upon Fresnel's laws of refraction. Photonegative snails were
observed to orient slong the plane of polarization, and photopositive
