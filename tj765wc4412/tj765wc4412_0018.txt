cauterized with a hot needle and the anesthetized snail immediately
placed in a test tank. The mucus trails showed that the snails

deviation from the course. (See Fig. 7) Totally blinded snails,
operated upon and tested in the same manner, proved to be totally
insensitive to light and proceeded on a path closely resembling that
of an unoperated snail in total darkness (Fig. 8).

L. planaxis behaves ertkokinetically, increasing both its
rate of turning and its rate of forward crawling at higher light
intensities.
