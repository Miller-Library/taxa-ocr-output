150 watt light source as measured through the filter by a thermopile
and galvonometer.
The light was switched off every 15 seconds and turned on 7/
seconds later. When the snail showed no reaction, in three consecutive
decreasing
/light trials, it was considered "adapted." No snail was used for
any two trials, thus a total of 50 snails was tested. The results
o
are given in Table 4.

A Corning Blue 4553 filter was substituted for the original
sccua
4503 when analysis with a hand spectrometer showed that this first
filter allowed a considerable amount of green light to pass. The
slight sensitivity to red light can probably be explained by the
small amount of orange or white light not absorbed by this filter.
The reactions to red light consisted at best of a slight jerk of
both tentacles. Thus the tentacle withdrawal response is specific only
A
for light in the graen portion of the spectrum. This is consistent
with the findings on L. littorea, which orient only to polarized
light in the blue-green portions of the spectrum (Charles, 1961).
Snails retested up to 2 hours after their first adaption
showed only partial and sporadic withdrawal. However, snails left
on the filter at full light intensity for up to 30 minutes showed
no appreciable difference in response from that of freshly collected
e
snails. This wouid indicate that the tentacle withdrawal response
and adaptation is due to a nervous function rather than the bleaching
of any specific pigment in the eye.
