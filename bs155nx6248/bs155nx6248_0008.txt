RESULTS
Analysis of urine: Ammonia was found to be the primary
constituent of the aqueous excreta. The level of urea ranged
from 0% in most samples analyzed (73 of 75) to 3.2% (in 2 of
75 samples). It is doubtful that urea is excreted. Uric acid
was below detection (less than 0.012 u mole per ml.). Incuba¬
tion of the urine in 1 N NaoH for 30 minutes gave no increase
over the level of endogenous ammonia. Similarly, the glutamine
hydrolysis in hot 10% TCA gave no more ammonia than in the nor¬
mally developed sample. Thus, labile amides in the urine are not
detectable and are assumed to be negligible. The rate of ammonia
output, in u moles/hour/g wet tissue, does not significantly
fluctuate over a 36 hour period nor does it fluctuate over a
shorter time period of 14 hours. Table 1 summarizes these results.
The results of the chromatographic study done on the
urine indicate that amino acids are not actively excreted by
C. spirabrancha. Only one compound gave a positive ninhydrin
test after the desalted urine concentrate was separated in two
dimensions: taurine was identified by matching it with the a¬
ppropriate spot on the map and proof of identification was made
by the unknown reacting with o-phthalaldehyde in acetone followed
by alcoholic KOH, giving the red color characteristic of taurine,
One other detectable substance with a very low Re (less than
0.05) was not identified, but it was assumed to be an arginine
type compound (Re arginine=0.07) such as taurocyamine.
