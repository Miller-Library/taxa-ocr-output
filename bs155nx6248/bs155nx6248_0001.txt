NITROGENOUS WASTE PRODUCTS AND EXCRETORY ENZYMES
IN THE MARINE POLYCHAETE CIRRIFORMIA SPIRABRANCHA
(MOORE, 1904)
INTRODUCTION
Although some information is available on nitrogenous
excretion in terrestrial oligochaetes, little is known about
the subject in marine polychaetes. Bahl did the first consis¬
tent study on oligochaete excretion. He found that ammonia,
urea, and creatinine were excreted through nephridia in the
body wall. Cohen and Lewis (1950) found high arginase activity
in the gut wall of Lumbricus and almost no activity in the body
wall. They concluded that the earthworm utilizes the ornithine¬
urea cycle as part of its nitrogen metabolism. More recently,
Needham (1960) has compared arginase activity in two oligochaetes,
Lumbricus and Eisenia, in relation to the amount of urea: ammon
ia excreted during feeding and fasting regimes. Needham's work
supported the study done earlier by Cohen and Lewis on the earth¬
worm. In the present study done on the cirratulid polychaete,
C. spirabrancha, nitrogenous excretion products have been deter¬
mined and levels of enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism have
been measured. The major waste product was found to be ammonia,
which is excreted through the tentacles and anterior body wall.
Urea and traces of taurine were also found in the aqueous excre¬
ta. The tissues exhibit all of the purine catabolism enzymes,
uricase, allantoinase, allantoicase, and urease. Three enzymes
in the ornithine-urea cycle were assayed: ornithine transcar¬
bamylase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase. Argininosuc¬
cinate synthetase and carbamyl phosphate synthetase were not
studied.
