The blood, tentacles, body wall, gut wall and aqueous gut con¬
tents of C. spirabrancha were analyzed for ammonia and urea in
both fresh worms and in worms fasting for one week. The same
tissues were assayed for uric acid, citrulline and two kinds of
labile amides. Results are summarized in Table 2. The tentacles
and gut wall show marked drops in ammonia levels upon inanition
while the level in the body wall shows a small decrease and the
level in the blood rises. The urea level in the tentacles, body
wall, and gut wall drops greatly, while the level of urea in the
blood drops less markedly. The level of ammonia and both al¬
kaline and acid labile amides are conspicuously high in the tent¬
acles. The gut wall, blood and body wall have much lower levels
of ammonia, descending in that order, and the ammonia content of
the gut contents is very low. Basic hydrolysis of the blood, body
wall and tentacles released more bound ammonia than the acid hy¬
drolysis, whereas the opposite situation is true in the gut wall.
Urea in the blood proved to be approximately twice the level found
in the three other tissues. The uric acid was very high in the
blood, much lower in the tentacles and gut wall, and below detec¬
tion in the body wall and aqueous gut contents (less than 0.095
u mole per gram of tissue).
Enzyme activities in different tissues: Three enzymes of
the ornithine-urea cycle were examined. Ornithine transcarbamyl¬
ase has the highest specific activity (71.6) of any of the three
enzymes. The blood contains the greatest cumulative activity of
all three of the enzymes. Table 3 summarizes the specific activ¬
ities of ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate lyase, and
arginase.
All of the enzymes involved in purine catabolism were
examined and allantoinase in the blood has the highest specif¬
