for biosynthesis of urea or its immediate precursors, while the
external tissues, the tentacles especially and the anterior body
wall, have very high urease activity.
The proposed anatomical sites of excretion correlate
well with the general behaviour of the worm and the descriptive
anatomy of the nephridia. The worm lives in a mucus burrow im¬
pacted in black, sulfide mud, and it waves its tentacles in the
circulating fresh sea water above the mud. Excretion of nitrogen
ous wastes through the tentacles, which have a very large sur¬
face area, would not expose the worm to high concentrations of
toxic ammonia within the stationary burrow.
The single pair of nephridia (Gilbert) are located ven¬
trally behind the first septum and extend posteriorly 3 to 5 seg¬
ments. The internal funnel is highly ciliated, giving each
nephridium the power to circulate a great quantity of fluid.
Each nephridium is intensely vascularized and possesses a large
nephridiopore (25-30 u in diameter). This proposed site of ex¬
cretion, the anterior body wall, would also allow dilution of tox¬
ic ammonia by the shifting sea water above the worm.
The maintainence of the ammonia level in the blood of a
fasting worm suggests that the blood contains most of the bio¬
synthetic machinery involved in nitrogen homeostasis, whereas the
body wall and tentacles mainly rids the body of nitrogenous wastes.
The finding of taurine as the only constituent besides
ammonia and a small amount of urea in the urine is perfectly
reasonable when one considers that 3% of the body wall's weight
is taurine (Luck) and some leakage can be expected.
There is no comparative literature on this subject ex¬
cept for the studies done on oligochaetes. Since the environ¬
