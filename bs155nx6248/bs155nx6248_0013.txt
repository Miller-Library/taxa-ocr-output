SUMMARY
1. C. spirabrancha primarily excretes ammonia, abng with
trace amounts of urea and taurine. No amino acids were found to
be excreted.
2. Studies of uricase, allantoinase, allantoicase, and
urease suggest that the ammonia primarily results from a urico-
lytic pathway.
3 The presence of ornithine transcarbamylase, arginino¬
guccinate lyase, arginase and citrulline in the tissues strongly
suggest a functional ornithine-urea cycle.
4. Glutamine-like labile amides present in the greatest
amounts in the tissues associated with excretion support the idea
that amino acid deamination may also play a role in the formation
of ammonia.
5. The rate of ammonia excretion in this sedentary
polychaete is relatively constant.
6. The ammonia content of the aqueous gut contents is
very low, which suggests that there is no enteronephric excretion.
7. The most probable sites of excretion are the tent¬
acles and, to a lesser extent, the anterior body wall, which con¬
tains a single pair of large nephridia. This hypothesis is sup¬
ported by biochemical assays done on the tissues, by behavioural
studies and by descriptive anatomy of the nephridia.
8. Following inanition, the levels of ammonia and urea
drop markedly in the tissues associated with excretion and main¬
tain their levels in the tissues associated with the bulk of the
catabolic machinery.
