sues were extracted with 1 ml. of homogenizing media per 0.125 g
of tissue. For some assays, 10% homogenates were used. Body
Walls and tentacles were homogenized in a motorized teflon pes¬
tle homogenizer; guts and blood were homogenized in ground glass
homogenizers.
Ornithine transcarbamylase assay: The method of Brown
and Cohen (1959) was modified for use with polychaete tissues.
0.5 ml. of CTB supernatant Sj and 0.25 ml. of supernatant S9
were added to 0.5 ml. 1-ornithine, pH 8.0, and 0.5 ml. Na gly¬
cylglycine buffer, pH 8.3, and the reaction started by addition
of 0.5 ml. carbamyl phosphate solution. The final u molar amounts
of substrates and buffers were the same as those used by Brown and
Cohen. The incubation was carried out at 24 degrees (as were
all enzyme assays to be described) and stopped by the addition
of 5.0 ml of 0.5 M HClOA. The deproteinized sample was filter¬
ed through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and directly applied to a
column of Dowex-50. Citrulline was eluted and four ml. of the
effluent was analyzed according to Archibald.
Argininosuccinate lyase enzyme assay: Activity was
assayed by a method similar to Needham's (1960) arginase assay,
with 2.0 ml. of 1.5% argininosuccinate in place of arginine as
the substrate. No attempts were made to substitute a C. spira¬
brancha "Ringer" for the appropriate amount of earthworm Ringer
suggested by Needham. The M/4 phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used
for all dilutions of tissue homogenates. The endogenous arginase
split any arginine formed during the incubation and the resulting
urea was determined as previously described.
Arginase assay: The method above was used only with the
substrate being 2 ml. of a 2% solution of arginine HCl.
