ication of Ternberg's (1964) method. Erlenmeyer flasks (125 ml.)
fitted with rubber serum stoppers, with sleeves, were substit¬
uted for the side arm flasks suggested by Ternberg. Saturated
sodium carbonate was introduced into the sealed vessel by means
of a syringe. The development tabs were cut from Whatman no. 1
filter paper and in all procedures handling the paper rubber
gloves were worn to avoid contamination from the skin. The method
proved to be very consistent (+ 0.015 u mole NHa was the standard
deviation for the urease solution used in the development of sam¬
ples containing urea and the standard deviation for the standard
ammonium sulfate solution was + 0.004 u mole NH3 )and ten times
more sensitive than Nesslerization.
Urea was determined as the difference (endogenous ammon¬
ia + ammonia liberated by urease) minus (endogenous ammonia a¬
lone). Samples were incubated with 100 ul. of a 10% solution
of urease (Matheson, Coleman, and Bell) in 30% ethanol for fif¬
teen minutes on a rotating platform. The modified Ternberg method
was employed for ammonia determinations.
Uric acid was determined by the colorimetric method of
Sobrino-Simoes (1965). Interfering substances are glucose and
ascorbic acid.
Citrulline was determined by the method of Archibald (1945),
It was necessary to use technical grade sulfuric acid (Ratner)
filtered through glass wool. It was also found that wrapping the
developing tubes in aluminum foil preserved the optical density
for up to four hours. The problem of interference by allantoin
and urea was avoided by filtering all samples through Whatman no.
