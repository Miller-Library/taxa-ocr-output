Glyoxylic acid was determined by the method of Brown
(1968). 2 ml. of 0.5 M HClO followed by 1 ml. of 2,4-dinitro¬
phenylhydrazine solution (50 mg./100 ml. 95% ethanol) were added
to 2 ml. of sample to be analyzed and this mixture was allowed to
stand at room temperature for 10 minutes to effect formation of the
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of glyoxylic acid. The final color
was developed by the addition of 2.50 ml. of 2.5 N NaoH with
rapid mixing. The color was transient (change in O.D. of 0.200
in one hour) but reproducible when readings were taken after a
fixed interval (15 minutes) for all samples.
Two different methods were utilized in the determination
of labile amides in the tissues of the worm. The first method
was a general alkaline hydrolysis carried out in 1 N NaoH for
30 minutes at room temperature. The second method was an acid
hydr; lysis taken from Harris' (1943) glutamine hydrolysis pro-
cedure. Samples were digested in 10% TCA at 70 degrees for 75
minutes, cooled, brought to pH 11 in the sealed microdiffusion
chamber and analyzed for ammonia. This method hydrolyzes glu¬
tamine completely. Under the same conditions asparagine gives
11% hydrolysis and urea 0.2%, whereas arginine, guanidine, guanine,
adenine, creatinine, and glutamic acid liberate no appreciable
amount of ammonia. The difference between total ammonia measur¬
ed after one of the two procedures and the endogenous ammonia
gave a measure of the amount of bound or labile ammonia pres¬
ent in the tissue of the worm. A control was run for each method:
for the alkaline hydrolysis, a tissue sample was brought to pH
11 and analyzed for ammonia. For the Harris method, hydrolysis
in 10% TCA for 75 minutes was carried out at 5 degrees.
