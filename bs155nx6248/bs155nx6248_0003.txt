of free amino acids was also investigated.
Analysis of free amino acids in aqueous excreta: Approx¬
imately 100 ml. of aqueous excreta (the term urine will be used
to refer to aqueous excreta collected from around the worms.
Bahl (1947) used similar terminology) was desalted by passing
the solution through a column of Dowex-50 (H' form, 200-400
mesh). Enough Dowex-50 was used to desalt two times the number
of millequivalents of monovalent cations in 100 ml. of sea water.
The column was eluted with 1 N NHAOH and the pH of the effluent
was monitored at all times. When the pH of the effluent changed
froml.2 to 4.4, the column was washed with three bed volumes
of 1 N NH,OH and all effluents combined. This amino acid frac¬
tion was evaporated to dryness in a flash evaporator and the cry¬
talline residue taken up in 1.0 ml. of distilled water. 10
ul, of amino acid extract was spotted on a 20 cm. by 20 cm. piece.
of Whatman no. 1 filter paper and developed in two dimensions
with n-butanol-acetic acid-water (4:1:5, the top layer of this
two layer system was used as the mobile phase) as the first sol
ventand n-butanol-2-butanone-water (2:2:1), with the chamber sat¬
urated with cyclohexylamine (Mizell and Simpson) as the second
solvent system. A standard map was made using arginine, lysine,
aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, asparagine, cystine, glycine
hydroxyproline, alanine, proline, cysteic acid, histidine, valine,
tyrosine, leucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, ser¬
ine, taurine, ornithine and citrulline. All chromatograms were
developed with Ninspray. It was necessary to use only one'ad¬
ditional identification procedure: the reaction between taurine
and o-phthalaldehyde followed by alcoholic KOH (Smith).
Analytical methods: Ammonia was determined by a modif-
