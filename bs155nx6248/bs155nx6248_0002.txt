EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
MATERIALS
Animals: Worms were collected daily from the mudflats
under Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California. Each worm weigh¬
ed from 0.3 to 1.3 grams. The tentacles, dorsal blood vessel,
body wall and gut wall were selectively removed for study.
Tissues were washed in sterile sea water to remove any coelomic
fluid, mucus, and gametes. The tissues were kept cold and weigh¬
ed in tared flasks.
Chemicals: 1-arginine (HCl), 1-lysine (HCl), 1-aspartic
acid, 1-cysteine (HCl), dl-asparagine, glycine, glycylglycine,
1-serine, 1-ornithine (HCl), 1-leucine, dl-histidine (HCl), 1¬
proline, hydroxy-1-proline, 1-cysteic acid, dl-tyrosine, 1-citrul¬
line, 1-valine, and argininosuccinate were obtained from Calbio¬
chem. L-phenylalanine, 1-glutamic acid, 1-tryptophan, alanine,
cystine, dilithium carbamyl phosphate, 2,3-butanedione-2-oxime,
allantoin, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, tris (hydroxymethyl)
aminomethane, and uric acid were ordered from Sigma. Ninspray
and taurine came from Nutritional Biochemicals. Allantoic acid
was obtained from K and K.
GENERAL METHODS
Collection of aqueous excreta: Fresh worms were dried
for 30 seconds on Whatman no. 1 filter paper, weighed, and placed
in plastic snap top vials along with 1.0 ml. of sterile sea
water containing streptomycin and penicillin at 1 mg. and 0.3
mg., respectively, per ml. At every collection interval 1 ml.
was drawn off and replaced by fresh sterile sea water. The sam¬
ples were analyzed for ammonia, urea, uric acid, alkaline labile
amides, and hot trichloroacetic acid labile amides. Excretion
