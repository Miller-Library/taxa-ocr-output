ic activity (66.50). It appears that both uricase and allanto¬
icase are both limiting in C. spirabrancha. Table 3 summarizes
the specific activities of these enzymes.
DISCUSSION
It is clear that the ammonia excreted by C. spirabrancha
comes from two sources: the first being the deamination of amino
acids, such as glutamine or other labile amides, which occur in
especially high levels in the tissues associated with excretion
(predominantly the tentacles and, to a lesser extent, the anter¬
ior body wall. This topic will be discussed in detail later in
the discussion.). The second source is purine catabolism. This
polychaete seems to have beneficially compartmentalized various
steps in the degradation of purines to ammonia. The blood poss¬
esses the highest uricase and allantoinase activities and the
lowest allantoicase activity, 9.13, 66.50, and 3.72, respect¬
ively. This suggests that mainly non-toxic degradation occurs
within the main body of the worm, while at the site of excretion,
the high levels of allantoicase and urease convert the allantoic
acid completely to ammonia, which then leaves the body or becomes
bound as a non-toxic amide such as glutamine. The latter fate of
the ammonia is highly likely because the rate of ammonia excre¬
tion is fairly constant and this would demand a regulation sys¬
tem which would internally control the endogenous ammonia.
It is of interest to note that the two limiting en¬
zymes in the purine cycle, uricase and allantoicase, have very sim¬
ilar maximum rates, 9.13 and 9.15, respectively, and occur in the
ratio of about 1:6 when compared to the non-limiting enzyme, allan¬
toinase. The study done by Brown, et al. (1966) on the purine cycle
enzymes in the liver of the African lungfish yields similar re¬
