Urease assay: Some modifications of the preceding method
afforded a good urease assay. Tissues were homogenized in M/4
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), diluted to 8 ml. and 2 ml. of 1%
urea were added to start the reaction. Addition of the arginase
cofactor Cocly was unnecessary in this procedure.
Uricase assay: The method for determining uricase was
adapted from Jorgenson's (1963) procedure for the enzymatic de¬
termination of uric acid and xanthine.
Tissue homogenates
were prepared in 0.06 M glycine buffer (pH 9.3). 0.2 ml. of
homogenate was diluted to 2.0 ml. with the same glycine buffer,
The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 ml. of 1.5 X
10-4 M uric acid solution and the resulting change in optical
density was recorded on a strip chart connected to a Beckman DU
Spectrophotometer with Gilford Linear Absorbance attachments.
Allantoinase assay: The method of Brown (1968) was em-
ployed for this assay. Homogenates were prepared with tris (hy¬
droxymethyl)aminomethane buffer (50 u moles per ml.), pH 7.8,
and a standard curve was prepared with known concentrations of
allantoic acid. All samples went through a heat treatment in or¬
der to cleave the allantoic acid into urea and glyoxylate and the
glyoxylate was measured as previously described.
Allantoicase assay: Tissues were homogenized in M/4
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, diluted to 8.5 ml. with more phosphate
buffer, and the reaction initiated by the addition of 1.5 ml.
of 2% allantoic acid solution. The standard assay for urea was
applied to 1 ml. samples every hour over a four hour period,
Blanks run in parallel gave no increase in the amount of ammonia
during the incubation period.
