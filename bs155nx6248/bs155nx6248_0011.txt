lationships. Both limiting enzymes have very similar activities,
1.27 and 1.25, and the ratio between limiting enzyme and the en¬
zyme in excess is roughly 5. Perhaps these similarities are
characteristic of organisms utilizing a purine cycle. This
speculation will require much comparative work for justification.
The possibility that the ornithine-urea cycle is function¬
al in C. spirabrancha cannot be dismissed. Ornithine transcar¬
bamylase in the blood has the highest activity of any enzyme
assayed and argininosuccinate lyase and arginase are also def¬
initely present. Neither carbamyl phosphate synthetase nor ar¬
gininosuccinate synthetase were studied. The unusually high ac¬
tivity of ornithine transcarbamylase compared with the other two
enzymes studied and the multiplicity of metabolic functions of
the intermediates in the ornithine-urea cycle suggest many other
possibilities for the presence of these enzymes than for strictly
the synthesis of urea. The arginase may be present in conjunc¬
tion with arginine phosphagens or it may serve to catalyze the
breakdown of ingested arginine to urea. In addition, 1-ornithine
can react with + -keto-glutarate (Bernfield) to eventually form
1-proline and carbamyl phosphate can act as a precursor in pyr¬
imidine biosynthesis through the intermediate uridylic acid.
The high concentration of endogenous citrulline strongly
suggests a conventional role for the ornithine cycle enzymes.
The presence of the cleavage enzyme strengthens the argument and
also suggests that the limiting enzyme is the condensing enzyme
a high citrulline concentration).
The distribution of urease in the four tissues studied
illustrates a rational scheme for choosing the sight of ammonia
excretion. The internal tissues, the blood and gut wall, are
very low in urease activity and very high in enzymes necessary
