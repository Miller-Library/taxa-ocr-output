ratio as close to l:l as possible, although it is recognized
that such pairs are not necessarily male-female and may
be male-male. (Gibson, 1964)
b. Assay of the effects of heavy metals
Solutions of cupric nitrate, lead nitrate, and silver
nitrate were made separately in distilled water so that each
principal metallic ionic species was in a concentration of
300,000 ug/1. Cadmium sulfate was dissolved in filtered
sea water to the same concentration. The presence of Cd'
ions already in the sea water was ignored as not being
significant. These solutions were kept in plastic bottles
and were used as the stock solutions for each day's work.
The test solutions were made up daily in sea water that had
been filtered through Whatman GF/C filter pape. The
dilutions for silver, copper and lead were 3,000 ug/1,
600 ug/1, 300 ug/1 and 30 ug/1 in sea water. The presence
of any metallic ions in the sea water was ignored as being
insignificant at the concentrations used. The concentrations
of 3,000 ug/1 for these metals actually represent saturated
solutions in sea water.
The cadmium solutions were made up in filtered sea water,
and as cadmium is much more soluble than the other metals,
it was therefore possible to meke up much more concentrated
solutions. The solutions used were: 300,000 ug/1,
30,000 ug/1, 15,000 ug/1, 6,000 ug/1, 3,000 ug/1, 300 ug/1,
