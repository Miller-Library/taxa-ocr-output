things would interfere with the animals' normal functions
and would therefore probably alter behavior.
The purpose of this experiment was to assay the
various toxicitiea of cadmium, copper, silver and lead and
to see how much several different concentrations of each
metal would differentially affect behavior of L. planaxis.
I would like to acknowlege the patient and generous
help of Dr. Malvern Gilmartin, Dr. D.P. Abbott, and
Dr. John Martin in preparing this project.
Materials and Methods:
a. Sampling procedures:
The snails were collected fresh for each day's experi-
ments. The animals were used immediately after capturen
and throughout the day up to 12 hours from the collecting
time. They were selected from a single location at Hopkins
Marine Station that was exposed to splash from heavy surf
at high tide. (See figure 1) All animals selected were
collected 1.8-3.1 meters above the high tide mark and were
of as uniform size as possible. They varied in size from
0.8-1.6 grams with an average size of 1.2 grams. Since
it has been shown that orientation to gravity effects the
behavioral response (Klabunde, 1964) only animals from
exposed, vertical surfaces were collected. As May falls
within the breeding season for L. planaxis, only copulating
pairs of snails were selected to insure a male-female
