and 30 49/.
Controls for copper, silver and lead were made by
adding 1 ml of distilled water to 99 ml of filtered sea
water, with successive 5,2, and 10 fold serial dilutions.
The control for cadmium was filtered sea water. The test
solutions were made in 50 m√† Erlenmeyer flasks. All
glasswear was rinsed in 4 N nitric acid before use.
c. Testing procedures
The animals were chosen randomly from the collected
samples to make up test groups of 15 snails each. The
first whorl of the animals' shells were filed off, thereby
exposing the mantle cavity. The animal was further exposed
by picking off the second whorl with a dissecting needle
while being careful not to puncture the membranes surrounding
the animals' internal organs. This procedure only uncovers
the digestive gland (Fretter and Graham, 1962) and has
no immediate effect on the amimal's behavior. However it
can only be used for short-term experimants, as it
leads to dessication.
The animals were introduced to the testsolutions
and kept forcibly submerged by wedging plastic screening
down the neck of the flask. The test solution were refrig-
erated at 12 C for 24 hours.
