groups which are reactive sites for many enzymes and therefore
undoubtedly block these enzyme functions. (Bowen, 1966).
Cadmium is another trace metal that blocks enzyme action. It
competes with zinc for binding sites on thiol groups; it
is bound more firmly to these groups than zinc. (Schroeder
et al., 1967). Cadmium is not an essential element for life.
Lead, on the other hand, does not necessarily block
enzyme functions, and, therefore, would not cause any immediate
acute effects. It does have several long-term effects in
that it can cause abnormalities in the synthesis of porphyrins.
and, in the organic form, can cause nerve damage. (Air
Resources Board, 1967). However, the long-term effects
of these doses are quite toxic. Lead is particularly interesting
with respect to L. planaxis in that this animal is one
of the few intertidal animas that rarely, if ever, get
sub merged by tides. Therefore they would also pick up
more lead fallout when feeding because they scrape the tops of
the rocks to gather up food and would, at the same tine.
pick up lead aerosol fallout. It would prove to be an
interesting experiment to measure lead content in L. planaxis
from different areas to see how concentrations varied
with location.
