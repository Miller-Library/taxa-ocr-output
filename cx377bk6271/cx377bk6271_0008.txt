Results:
The relative toxicity of each metal at different
concentrations is shown by figure 2 which plots the
difference between the percentage of controls that
righted themselves and the percentage of treated animals
that righted themselves within a certain period of time.
The relative toxicities of all the metals at a single
concentration are graphed in figure 3. The vertical
axis represents differences in percentages between the
numbers of righted animals in the conrrol and the test
solutions. The horixontal axis represents time in minutes.
The means variances, and standard deviations with each
concentration of all the metals arelisted in fiugre 4.
To reach these figures 8% of the highest numbers were
rejected. Student"s t-tests were run to determine
uniqueness of groups. The starred groups were those found
to be different from the control at the.05 level.
The data on crawling times for the snails was rejected
as being too erratic.
Discussion:
The results obtained by these experimants show that
differentsconcentrations of cadmium, copper, and silver
definitely affect the righting response of L. planaxis.
With the exception of lead, the greater the concentration of
the metallic ion in water, the longer the righting response
