After the incubation period, the test animals were
removed from the solutions and blotted on apaper towel.
They were then dropped, spire-downward, at 2 second intervals
into 15 150 mmx 16 mm round-bottom test tubes that had
been filled with fresh, normal sea water.
The time it took the animals to right themselves and
the time it took them to climb 90 mm up the test tubes
were noted to the nearest 10 seconds. For convenience,
30 minutes was chosen as the trial cut-off point. Three
trials of 15 snails each were used for each concentration of
each metal and the control.
As 8% of the controls did not right themselves in
30 minutes, these animals were considered aberrant in
behavior and were eliminated from statistical calculations.
The highest 8% of the righting times were eliminated from
all concentrations of the metals. For each concentration
of each metal, the mean, variance and standard deviations
were found. Each concentration of control was treated
separately. Student's t-test were run for each control
group against every other control group. (Simpson et al.
1960). It was shown that the controls were all the same
within the.05 probability range. Then the mean, variance
and standard deviation of all the controls, taken as a
group were used in t-test with the concentrations of metals.
