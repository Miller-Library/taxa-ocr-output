was delayed. This trend is especially evident in the cadmium
solutions where it was able to concentrate the solution
enough to reach a lethal dose. Cadmium is also interesting
in that there is a very marked threshold effect between
6,000 ug/1 and 3,000 ug/1; all the animals died at 6,000 u9/
and all lived at 3,000 ug/1 albeit they sho ed a delayed
righting response.
Silver and copper also  trends that seemed to
indicate that threshold effects would be observed at
higher concentrations. Unfortunately 3,000 ug/1
represents a saturated solution in sea water for these
metals. The only metal that had no clear cut effects
on righting response was lead,
As shown in figure 2, at high concentrations, all
other things being equal, copper and silver showed a
trend in being more toxic than either lead or cadmium.
In lower concentrations, the relative toxicities of the
different metals was not so obvious. Et lower concentrations
copper semms to be the most toxic of the tested solutions,
The data on crawling times was rejected because
t-tests revealed them to be random functions. This can
be explained by the fact that there are many more variables
involved with crawling time than with righting time.
Crawling time is influenced by the past history of the
animal, notably the surface from wheih it was collected.
It is also influenced by such physical factors such as
