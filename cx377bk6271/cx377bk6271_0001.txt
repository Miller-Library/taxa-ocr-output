Abstract
The effects of different concentrations of several
heavy metals on the righting behavior of Littorina
planaxis were studied. Part of the animals' shells
were removed. They were then submerged in sea water
that contained different concentrations of cadmium,
copper, lead and silver. The effects of these treatÂ¬
ments were assayed by timing the animals' righting response.
The results obtained show that cadmium, copper and
silver have significant effects only at high concentrations.
Lead was shown to have no significant short-term effects.
