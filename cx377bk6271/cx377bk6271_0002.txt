Introduction:
Much public attention has been drawn recently to
pollution of the environment by heavy metals. Many
symposia on the subject have been held to discuss problems
such as cadmium poisoning and aerosol lead fallout.
(Symposium on Metals and Ecology, 1969) Very little has
been published in this field that deals with intertidal
invertebrates and nothing has been done to assay the
relative toxicities of heavy metals and their effects on
animal behavior.
The most common animal in the intertidal splash zone
is Littorina planaxis, which ranges from Puget Sound to
southern lower California (Ricketts and Calvin, 1952)
It is found 1,5-3.1 meters above the height reached by
the highest spring tides. (Light et al., 1954 and Hyman,1964)
This is sigmificant because it means that littorines are
never submerged by the tides and are exposed to the air
at almost all times. While littorines are never completely
covered with water, they are splashed with water from the
air-water interface. The detrital matter and microscopic
algae whicharewashed up by this spray suppl the
animals' major source of food. The significance Ã¶f
these facts is that littorines are exposed to pollution
from both the air and the water. They are splashed by
and eat the detrital matter washed up by the air-water
interface, which is thought to concentrate heavy metals.
