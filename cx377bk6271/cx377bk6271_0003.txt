(Baxter and Lopez, 1971). Being exposed to the air,
littorines are subject to aerosol metal fallout, notably
that of lead. As littorines are scraper feeders, they
ingest any metal fallout from the surrounding rocks when
they eat. These facts make L. planaxis an interesting
animal to study in connection with heavy metal pollution.
L. planaxis is also useful because it has a marked an
dependable behavior pattern. As it has a gill partially
adapted for air breathing, it cannot live indefinitely in
water and if forcibly submerged, it will ultimately
drown (Ricketts and Calvin, 1952). It therefore reacts
quickly to being submerged in sea water, and will immediately
right itself and start to crawl up the nearest vertical
surface. This behavior has been used in the past to assay
the toxicity of sea aenemone nematocysts (Phillips and
Abbott, 1957), and it provides an almost ideal system in
which to study the effects of almost any toxicant on
behavior.
Heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, and silver
would be expected to affect behavior in that they are
toxic substances. These metals block the activity of
many enzymes and would therefore be expected to alter
bodily functions such as respiration and digestion.
Lead affects the production of porphyrins, the respiratory
pigments present in most animals and plants. In its organic
form, lead causes severe nerve damage. Any one of these
