light intensity and direction. All such factors make the
experiment difficult to control.
A problem with this experiment is that the concentrations
of metals used in these experiments do not reflect the possible
situations in nature. The actual concentrations of these
metals in sea water are: Cd: 0.1 ug/1, Pb: 0.03 ug/1.
Cu: 3 ug/1, and Ag: 0.3 ug/1. (Goldberg, 1963). Consequently,
the results observed are due to acute conditions and could
not possibly be duplicated in nature during the same length
of time. A series of experiments that would better reflect
the situation in the real world would be to dose the snails with
heavy metals in low concentrations for a longer period
of time. However, if these experiments were undertaken, the
technique would have to be changed as th animals would show
the effects of dessication after two days. A possible
technique for long-term experimentation would be
to fill the mantle cavity several times daily with treated
water. Another method would be to culture microscopic algae
so that heavy metals were concentrated in the culture which
would then be fed to the littorines.
The relative toxicities of any set substances depends
greatly on how they actually act in the body. It is surprising
t hat copper, which is contained in hemocyanin in moalusc
blood, is so toxic to them. Copper in small amounts is an
essential element for life, but in larger amounts, it is
extremely toxic. The electronegative elements such as
1+ and Ag' have an affinity for amino, imino, and sulphydryl
