Although smooth muscle has been heavily investigated, the mech¬
anisms involved in regulation of contractile activation are not yet
well documented (+-2) Specifically, the question of whether or not smooth
muscle cells sequester calcium in intracellular vesicles analogous
to the sarcoplasmic recticulum in striated muscle, and whether this
Ca is released in response to depolarization to activate contraction
is controversial. An important difficulty in studying smooth muscle is
finding a preparation in which the muscle cells are arranged in such a
geometry as to allow quantitative interpretation of results from elec¬
tric al and mechanical studies. Most preparations are syncytiums of
small, branching cells arranged in complex geometries. However, the
troponin regulated smooth muscle cells of Ascidians (31)primitive
chordates, may be a useful model system for vertebrate smooth muscle..
We report here experiments on the longitudinal body wall muscles of
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ciona intestinalis : Exact'>Ciona intestinalis</span> using standard morphological and physiological methods.
The muscle cells are arranged in long parallel bundles which are easily
dissected and rapidly contract in response to electrical stimulation.
Relaxation is slow. Activation of action potentials and twitches are
critically dependant on external Ca, whereas extracellular Na shows no
effect on excitability. Contractile response to depolarization via action
potentials or KCl application dissappears at similar rates upon appli¬
cation of Ca free solutions. Our results do not support the existence
of intracellular stores of releasable Ca and suggest that Ca influx is
the sole source of activator Ca.

Mature specimens of Ciona intestinalis were collected from the
harbor in Monterey Bay, California. Longitudinal muscle bands of
.1-.5 mm diameter were dissected in a standard artificial sea water
(ASW) containing 10 mM Cacl,, 60 Mm MgCl,, 10 mM KCl, 460 mM Nacl,
and 10 mM Tris. Light microscopic studies were made on paraffin embedded, 8 u
sectioned preparations fixed with Helly's and stained with Mallory's
Azan (5). Preparations for examination by scanning electron micro¬
scopy (SEM) were pinned out and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde,,1% formal¬
dehyde and 7.2% Hepes in filtered sea water. For physiological ex¬
periments, preparations were mounted at near their in vivo resting length
in a 5 ml chamber with a sylgard floor. One end of the bundle was
pinned to the floor; the other was attached to a Pixie element (Endevcc
Corp.) force transducer as described by Gilly (6). <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Ag/AgCl electrodes</span>
were placed at either end of the chamber and 60-100 V shocks of 2 ms
duration were applied either singly (twitch), or at a rate of 40/sec
(tetanus). Action potentials were recorded using a glass suction
micropipette applied against the outer surface of the muscle preparation.
Solutions employed were derived from the standard ASW in such a manner
as to keep ionic strength constant. Thus, Nacl was appropriately re¬
duced to accommodate high divalent cation levels and Tris Cl or KCl
totally replaced Nacl on an equimolar basis. O Ca solutions were
prepared omitting Ca and adding 5 mM EGTA and 60 mM MgCl.. All drugs were
obtained from Sigma Chemicals.

Photomicrographs from light (Fig. 1A) and SEM (Fig. 1B) examin¬
aton of longitudinal smooth muscle bundles revealed long, thin parallel
fibers of 1044 diameter (Fig. 1A) which could be followed in longi¬
tudinal sections continuously for up to 1 mm before disappearing
out of the section making exact determination of length inconclusive.
It is possible that individual cells might run the full length of the
muscle bands, but they might also terminate somewhere in the middle of
the bundle. In cross sections (not illustrated), groups of roughly
50 individual muscle cells were observed to be arranged in small bundles
of about 50 u diameter, each bundle being surrounded by a thin layer of
connective tissue. Such a bundle can be visualized in Fig. 14. At the
next level of organization, several bundles were enclosed by a cellular
epithelial - type sheath which could largely be removed by dissection,
This sheath can be seen at the top of Fig. 14. In Fig 1B, the sheath has
been slit open and pinned out in the upper left corner of the figure.
Thus, the inner surface of the sheet is seen in Fig:lB.
Individual muscle cells in the smaller bundles appeared to be covered
with spheroid or obloid grape - like cells of up to 5 u diameter.
Whether these cells were actually a separate cell type or simply evagin¬
ations of the muscle cell membrane could not be unequivocally determined,
but the total lack of red staining inside these cells in sharp contrast
to the muscle cells points to a different cell type (Fig. 1B). The
function of these glial - like cells is totally unknown.
When stimulated with a brief shock, bundles of muscle cells responded
with a vigorous twitch. Fig. 2A shows such a twitch and the recorded
action potential which triggered it. Although the action potential
Nevitt
must last only about 10 ms and was found to propagate at a velocity of
about 300 cm/sec, the ensuing twitch is relatively much slower. Although
twitches were always elicited with super-maximal shocks, in a multi¬
cellular preparation such as this one, it is difficult to prove uniform
and complete propagation down the entire length. To ensure that the
muscle contractions were not simply due to local responses at the
cathodal end and/or dependent on polarity or placement of the electrodes
in the chamber, a control test was performed using a rambling cathode
mounted on a micromanipulator with anodes placed at both ends. Muscles
were stimulated at various positions along the length,and amplitude
and time course of twitch responses did not depend on the rambler's
position. We conclude that the action potential can propagate from end
to end, allowing nearly spontan?ous activation of the entire length of the
fiber. Figure 2B illustrates the relative sizes of twitch, tetanus, and
KCl contracture in the same muscle in ASW. Twitches are typically
much smaller than tetani, Tetani were at least half as large as KCl
responses. These relative amplitudes depend, however, on external Ca
as described below.
Manipulations of extracellular Ca clearly indicate that contractility
is determined by Ca level. Figure 3A illustrates this phenomenon:
twitch force (closed symbols) is rapidly elevated as extracellular Ca concen¬
trationis increased from 10 to 60 mM, whereas twitches more slowly
deteriorate as extracellular Ca drops to near zero in O Ca-5 mM EGTA
solution. Upon replacing external Ca, twitch height fully reverses.
Tetanic force (open symbols in Fig. 3A) varied similarly, but the increase
in going from 10 to 60 mM was far smaller than for a twitch. Figure 3B
shows a more complete analysis of twitch and tetanus height as a function
of externalCa over a range of 0-100 mM Ca. Both twitch and tetanus
Nevitt 6
saturate near 60 mM.
In order to ascertain the mechanism by which external Ca regulates
contractile activation, effects of several Ca channel blockers were
studied. If Ca channels were directly associated with poopagation of the
action potential, action potentials and twitches ought to fail if the
channels are blocked. Table 1 indicates changes in twitch and tetanus
force in muscles exposed to a variety of Ca and Na blockers. Complete
removal of external Na (Tris replaced) or application of 104 tetrodo¬
toxin had no inhibitory effect on muscle contractability. Na free Tris
ASW actually promoted a 40% increase in twitch magnitude with no noticdble
difference in tetanic force. Likewise, 2.5 mM Verapamil was totally
ineffective. The polyvalent cations, Cd and La2 resulted in gradual
decay of excitabllity to zero twitch force over a time course comparable
to that previously documented for 0 Ca-EGTA solutions (Fig. 34).
Moreover, some preliminary experiments administering Ba to preparations in
10 Ca ASW or following Ca depletion in O Ca EGTA solutions for two
hours resulted in dramatically increased excitability, with twitches
growing in amplitude and becomming very prolongued.
Based on these results with divalent cations, it is clear that Ca
must be the primary external cation involved in rapid propagation of the
action potential of the smooth muscle of Ciona intestinalis. Thus, it
is not surprising that contraction fails in 0 Ca. Neither a Ca influx
underlying the action potential nor sufficient depolarization to
release internally sequestered Ca is possible under these currcumstances.
Consequently, further experimentation was geared towerds uncovering the
sourfe of Ca ions involved in activating the contractile machinery in
the muscle cells. Specifically, the question of whether, sarcoplasmic
vesicles which can release Ca in response to depolarization in the absence
Nevitt 4
of Ca influx are present was addredsed.
Muscles were bathed in 60 mM Ca ASW until a stable level of tetanus
was attained. The solution was then changed to O Ca-EGTA (time zero in
Fig. 4). Twitches were recorded at regular intervals until no force
could be observed. This decline is plotted in Fig. 4 (indicated by
squares). Tetani (indicated by triangles) were then applied, again until
zero response was reached indicating an apparent total failure of
action potentials due to depletion of external Ca. At this time, appli¬
cation of KCl 0 Ca-EGTA showed a definite response (indicated with
arrow). Thus, two possibilities present themselves: (a) no vesicles as
postulated above were present and KCl depolarization allowed a small
influx ofresidualtexternal Ca, or (b) such vesicles were present and were
subject to a significantly slower depletion of Ca than was the extra¬
cellular space. If (b) were true, then action potential rundown as
monitored by decline of twitch and tetanus size would occur at a faster
rate than depletion of intracellular vesicles as monitored by KCl application.
In order to test this hypothesis, the experiment was repeated after
obtaining full recovery in high Ca, and O Ca-EGTA KCl was applied at different
O Ca soak times. Figure 4 shows the results of this experiment with four
different soak times and no significant difference between rates of decay
for tetanus or KCl contracture in the O Ca solution is indicated. Thus,
either no sarcoplasmic vesicles are present or any such sequestering
vesicles that do exist are so inefficient as to be depleted at the same rate
as extracellular Ca.

Discussion
From the evidence presented here, it is proposed that Ca sequestering/
releasing vesicles are not present in the smooth muscle of Ciona intestinalis
All Ca necessary to activate the contractile mechanism must therefore be
derived from extracellular Ca.
Electrical measurements are needed to show more directly the role
of Ca in propagating the action potential. Specifically, is Ca the
only ion involved and if so, can enough Ca enter the cell to activate
a twitch?
Likewise, more detailed morphological study is necessary to approach
the more critical question of the existence of sarcoplasmic vesicles
and to deduce the anatomical relationship between the smooth muscle cells
and the grape-like structures which surround them. It seems valikely
that these structures are simply evaginations of the muscle cell
membrane whether these structures are separate cells or are simply
evaginations of the muscle cell membrane appearing at short muscle
lengths (see 7) is still unknown.
