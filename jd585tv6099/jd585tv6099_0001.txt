ACKNOWEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank my advisor, Stuart Thompson, for his help
and encouragement. I would also like to thank William Gilly for his
patience, answers, and the use of much of his equipment. Thank you
also to George Mackey for the methylene blue. Mark Denny deserves
many thanks for the use of his tools and the Fisher bathroom key.
Bruce Hopkins was very helpful in setting up the Aquatron that made
the whole-animal preparation possible. My labmates, John, Shannon,
and Simone should be canonized for putting up with me through many
frustrating hours. Thanks to the friendly people at Hopkins in
general, who were always willing to take time out and lend a hand.
A sigh of thanks to my roommate and best friend, Terri, who bore the
brunt of my weary, edgy demeanor. And finally, last but far from
least, hearty thanks to my TAs, Sam Wang and Jennifer Levitt, each
of whom rescued me one way or another throughout the quarter.
