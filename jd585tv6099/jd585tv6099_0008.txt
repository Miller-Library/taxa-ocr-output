components to this habituation: (1) amount of
contraction/withdrawal and (2) time to re-extend the hood. The
latter was reduced more rapidly. The shrug response was not tested
for the other remaining eight characteristics necessary for true
habituation (Shabb, 1984; Peeke and Herz, 1973).
Other features of this response include the fact that a crumple
response can be elicited if the novel stimulus is severe, and that
this response is inhibited during swimming and during locomotion.
Previous authors have noted that the hood is in a "neutral", semiÂ¬
contracted state during swimming (Hurst, 1968; Thompson). Perhaps
this posture is not only characteristic but very important to
swimming, such that the shrug is actively inhibited during
swimming
Neuroanatomical Results
Four anterior nerve roots were clearly identifiable from
specimen to specimen (see Figure 6). These have been labelled as
nerve roots C1-C4 (Hurst, 1968), although 1 found that C1 actually
attaches to the tentacular lobe, and C4 appears to come from the
ventrolateral surface of the pleural ganglion.
In tracing the nerves from the cerebral ganglion out into the
oral hood, it was found that the C2 nerve branched twice, which is in
agreement with Hurst's results (Hurst, 1967). The terminal points
of the first branch were found to be located in the region between
the rhinophores, while other terminal points were in the longitudinal
muscles of the hood (see Figure 4).
