Swimming behavior is controlled by a Central Pattern
Generator (Thompson). The swimming consists of rhythmic side-toÂ¬
side contractions (see Figure 3) that occur when the foot becomes
dislodged from the substratum and ceases when the foot comes in
contact with the substratum again.
This paper describes a new response, referred to as the shrug
response (described in detail below), which cannot be elicited during
swimming. This inhibition during swimming raises some interest
questions. Is there active inhibition of the response during
swimming? Is this centrally mediated? Or is the shrug a local
retlex? Is the shrug inhibited during swimming because there are
muscles common to the two behaviors, or for some other reason? If
some other reason, what could it be?
The present studies addressed these and other questions about
the nature of the shrug response in Melibe leonina,
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Behavioral Methods
A precondition for accurate neuroethological studies is
knowledge of the experimental animal's behavioral repertoire in its
natural context (Ewert, 1980). Thus an aquarium was set up for
behavioral observations. Three animals were placed in the tank
simultaneously (animals were rotated) and their behaviors observed
and manipulated. Feeding, copulation, locomotion, and swimming
