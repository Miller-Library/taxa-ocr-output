INTRODUCTION
Melibe leonina is a nudibranch mollusc belonging to the family
Tethyidae. It is found along the west coast of the United States,
from Alaska to Mexico (McDonald, et al, 1980). Melibe leonina is so
named (leonina="lion-like") because of its large oral hood complete
with two rows of oral tentacles. On the dorsal surface of the oral
hood are two rhinophores, which are chemoreceptive organs (see
Figures 1, 2).
Melibe were collected by snorkelers and SCUBA divers off Del
Monte Beach on Monterey Bay and were kept at Hopkins Marine
Station in tanks of flowing seawater filled with kelp. An additional
tank was kept at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in order to ensure that
many of the Melibe would stay alive in case problems arose with the
tanks at Hopkins.
Melibe leonina is an ideal organism for behavioral and
neurophysiological study for many reasons. For one, unlike other
nudibranchs, Melibe has a wide variety of active motor behaviors.
including feeding, copulation, locomotion, defense responses, and
swimming. In addition, it has a nearly translucent body wall, which
facilitates dissection. Melibe has a "brain" consisting of three
paired ganglia that are centrally located, and its large, round
neurons are amenable to electrophysiological recordings.
