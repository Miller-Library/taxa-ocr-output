Another possibility for further study is the investigation of
the behavioral hierarchy of Melibe. Diagrams detailing the
interrelationships of behaviors have been constructed (and
reconstructed) for many mollusks (Willows, 1985; Davis, et al.
1974; Gillette and Davis, 1974). The present study indicates that
swimming has a fairly central place in the priority sequence of
Melibe (see Figure 10 for preliminary hierarchy). Swimming inhibits
both the shrug response and feeding movements, and it occurs
whenever the animal becomes dislodged from the substratum. A
more detailed study of the behavioral hierarchy of Melibe would
reveal how homologous it is to those of other molluscs and might
give valuable insight into the larger issue of behavioral chojce.
which is common to a wide range of organisms in the animal
kingdom.
Another property common to many organisms is learning.
Studies of training, conditioning, and habituation have served as
models of basic, or simple, learning. Many researchers (Pinsker, et
al, 1969, Kupferman, et al, 1969, and Castellucci, et al, 1969) have
used molluscan preparations for studies of habituation. Howeyer, it
has been shown that such learning studies have involved neural
pathways that are not as straightforward as was once thought. In
the most common preparation, Aplysia californica, three different
sites for habituation of the gill withdrawal reflex have been found.
each of which is sufficient to mediate habituation (Peretz, et al.
1976). The present study confirms that the shrug response in Melibe
leonina is not mediated via a local reflex circuit (i.e., peripheral
pathway, as in Aplysia). Thus, this organism and behavior might
