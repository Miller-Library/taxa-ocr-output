Electrophysiological Results
From recordings made from the anterior nerve roots, C2 was
the only one that showed bursts when the shrug was elicited. It
appeared to be somehow involved in mediating the shrug response.
while the other nerve roots did not.
C2 was identified as the nerve which mediates the shrug
response by ablation experiments. Unilateral ablation of C2 resulted
in a loss of the shrug. It was clear that this loss was not simply due
to sensory information being cut off, because: 1) the rhinophores
still withdrew when a stimulus was applied, and 2) the crumple was
clearly elicited when the strength of the stimulus was increased.
The control experiment showed that the loss of the shrug was not
due to trauma. When each of the other nerve roots was cut, the
shrug remained. It was only when C2 was cut that the shrug was
abolished. Bilateral ablation of C2 resulted in loss of the crumple in
response to mechanical stimulation between the rhinophores, while
it still occurred in response to mechanical stimulation of the body
wall. It appeared, then, that while the sensory information carried
in C2 unilaterally was enough to elicit the crumple, C2 was needed
bilaterally in order for the shrug to occur.
Recordings from intact C2 showed clear bursts (with a mean
duration of 890 msec and 10.3 spikes; see Figure 9) when the shrug
was elicited. It was clear that these were not just the sensory
neurons from the dorsal surface of the oral hood, because there were
no bursts when stimulation did not produce the shrug (e.g., during
swimming).
