In order to correlate behavioral activity with neural activity, a
whole-animal preparation was used, similar to that used by Willows
with Tritonia (Willows, 1967). With the brain suspended from a
platform, the animal was able to behave in the tank while recordings
trom its nerve cells were obtained (see Figure 5).
Using focal extracellular electrodes, recordings were made
from the anterior nerve roots in an attempt to isolate the nerve
responsible for mediating the shrug response. In order to
accomplish this, a portion of the nerve was sucked up into the tip of
the electrode, spontaneous activity was noted, and any changes in
firing when the shrug was elicited were noted.
Is the shrug centrally commanded? The fact that a behavior
can be commanded centrally does not rule out the possibility that
there is a peripheral pathway sufficient to maintain the response in
the absence of central excitation. This is the case with the Aplysja
gill withdrawal (Peretz, et al, 1976). In order to address this, the
C2 nerve (see Figures 4, 6) was cut both unilaterally and bilaterally
and the effects on behavior noted. A control, in which each of the
other anterior nerve roots was cut, tested for effects of trauma.
As mentioned, the shrug appears to be inhibited during
swimming. Therefore the activity of C2 was recorded while the
animal was swimming versus when its foot was attached to the
kelp.
It the motor commands for the shrug response are being sent
to the periphery via C2, stimulation of C2 should elicit (at least
some component of) the behavior. Electrical stimulation was
applied to C2, first intact and then to the cut end. Stimulation
