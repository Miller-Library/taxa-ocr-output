frequency was 5.5 Hz, with a delay of 2msec, and a duration of 120
msec. Voltage was the parameter varied.
Since C2 attaches to the dorsal surface of the cerebral
ganglion, the search for the shrug motoneurons began there. The
method employed was the extracellular hunting technique.
Recordings were made from various areas in the paired cerebral
ganglia, the origin/termination site of C2 nerve root. It was
difficult to reliably identify neurons, since sizes, shapes, and
coloration varied from brain to brain. However, the cerebral
ganglion has a few (3-6) readily identifiable giant cells, which are
thought to be important hood motoneurons (Hurst, 1968), and
recordings were made from these cells and the cells in this area
(see Figure 6). Recordings included neural firing during swimming,
while the animal was on the kelp, and while the shrug was elicited.
RESULTS
Behavioral Results
While mapping the receptive fields for the crumple response,
the shrug response was first noticed. When the animal was touched
on the dorsal surface of the oral hood between the rhinophores, the
hood (and the hood ALONE) was retracted toward the body and
flattened (see Figure 7). The fact that the shrug is localized to the
hood distinguishes it from the crumple, which is a full-body
response. The shrug habituates rapidly. It habituated more rapidly
with a smaller interstimulus interval (see Figure 8), and a 30Â¬
second interval yielded full recovery of the response. There are two
