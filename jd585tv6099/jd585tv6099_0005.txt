were observed naturally. The aquarium was supplied with flowing
seawater (11-15 C), and the tank was guarded from harsh sunlight.
In addition to observing behaviors in natural context, behaviors were
also manipulated. A glass rod was used to test the crumple response
(Thompson), a defensive response to tactile stimulation.
Tracing the Neuroanatomy
In an attempt to isolate the nerve responsible for mediating
the shrug response, the nerve roots from the brain innervating the
oral hood were mapped. This was accomplished by careful
dissection and methylene blue staining. Since the nerves in Melibe
appear appreciably more grainy than the muscles under the
dissecting scope, it was possible to trace the nerve roots out into
the hood via careful dissection.
In order to reinforce the dissections, specimens were stained
with methylene blue (dilution ratio = 3 drops/20mL dH2O) for
approximately 50 hours. This helped make the nerve roots stand out
clearly and was especially helpful in getting a depth perspective on
the roots as they dove out of the brain region and into the
surrounding tissue. Once the particular nerve responsible for
mediating the shrug response was isolated by electrophysiological
methods (see below), it was traced thoroughly into the hood (see
Figure 4).
