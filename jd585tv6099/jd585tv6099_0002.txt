ABSTRACT
Some of the behaviors of the marine nudibranch Melibe leonina
have been described, such as feeding, "galloping", the crumple
response, and its fascinating swimming behavior (Hurst, 1968:
Thompson). However, a new behavior, the shrug response, has been
noticed and is described here. It was noted via visual observations
that this behavior habituated quickly and was inhibited during
swimming and locomotion. The purpose of this study was to observe
and describe the properties of this behavior, trace it
neuroanatomically, and find its relation to other motor behaviors.
Results of behavioral manipulations and electrophysiological
recordings showed that the shrug response is part of a behavioral
hierarchy and, because it is mediated through one, central pathway,
would be good for studies of habituation.
