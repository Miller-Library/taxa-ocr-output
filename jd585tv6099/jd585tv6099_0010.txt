Recordings from the cerebral giant area revealed some cells
that appeared to burst when the shrug was elicited. The cells in this
area also fired when hood and tentacular movements were made, in
response to touch or pinch of the oral tentacles, and during feedingÂ¬
type movements. A rather spectacular finding was that all of the
cells surveyed seemed to have decreased firing when the animal was
swimming as compared to when it was on the kelp.
DISCUSSION
The fact that the shrug response is inhibited during swimming
brings up two possibilities for further study. The first is the
mechanism by which the output of a Central Pattern Generator
inhibits other motor behaviors. Because the shrug is inhibited
during swimming , and because all of the cells surveyed in the region
of the giant cells in the cerebral ganglion showed decreased firing
during swim (consistent with results of Thompson), I arrived at the
hypothesis that some neurotransmitter is acting more like a
hormone by being dumped locally into the ganglion instead of being
active at distinct synapses. This type of mechanism has been
worked out for suppression of behaviors in both Aplysia (Kandel,
1976) and Pleurobranchaea (Davis, et al, 1974). This general
inhibition of hood motor activities may be important if the hood
must remain in its "neutral", semi-contracted state (State 2 of
Figure 9) for swimming to be efficient.
