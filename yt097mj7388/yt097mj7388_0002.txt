Until recently, expression of exogenous DNA in mature, non-dividing cells, such
as differentiated neurons, has not been possible. The DNA, when it is placed in the
nucleus of such cells, remains untranslated and is eventually degraded. However, in
February 1992, Bong-Kiun Kaang, Eric Kandel, and others reported expression of
exogenous DNA in the abdominal ganglia of Aplysia californica by using a Rous
sarcoma virus (RSV) promoterlenhancer sequence (Kaang, et al, 1992). They were able
to get expression of this vector not only in the abdominal ganglion, but also in the buccal
ganglion, the pleural ganglion, the pedal ganglion, the cerebral ganglion, motoneurons,
interneurons, and sensory neurons (Kaang, 1992).
Iwas able to get from the Kandel laboratory a copy of one of the plasmids they
used, the pNEX-lacz, which contained the RSV sequence and the Escherichia coli lacz
gene as the reporter gene. (Fig. 1) Through microinjecting, have been able to get
expression of this vector in mouse sympathetic neuroblastoma cells (NIE-115), but
have not been successful with its expression in either the abdominal ganglia of Aplysia
or the giant fiber lobe (GFL) cells of the squid Loligo opalescens.
MATEBIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of the Plasmid. The pNEX-lacZ plasmid was transformed into
E.coli and grown overnight in DYT and ampicillin broth. The DNA was then isolated
using the Oiagen midi preparation procedure and cleaned in a phenolschloroform
extraction.
Microinjection of Plasmids into Giant Fiber Lobe Cells. From Loligo
opalescens the giant fiber lobe was dissected and plated as previously described. (Gilly
et al, 1990) Within 1-48 hours after plating, the neurons were injected using a
compressed gas system (Eppendorf Microinjector 5242 and N2 gas) with a DNA solution
consisting of 0.5 ug/uI DNA, 0.05-0.5% fast green, 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.3, and 100
