APPENDIX B: DNA CLEANING
In my protocol, the DNA used for injection was cleaned by running it through a
Oaigen column. When the Kandel lab was contacted, it was found that when they started
to do the research they also used a Oaigen column, but that they switched over to
centrifuging the DNA in a CsCllethidium bromide gradient. Whether this does get the
DNA cleaner is not known, but the Oaigen-cleaned DNA turned out to be extremely
sticky, clogging the microelectrode very easily. Whether this stickiness is an innate
property of the DNA or whether it is due to contaminants is unknown, and how this affects
the success of the injections is likewise unknown.
