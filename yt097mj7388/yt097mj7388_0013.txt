A photo of a positively stained neuroblastoma cell for B-galactosidase
assay.
(A) The percentage of cells surviving in three different heat shock times.
The filled circles are the control, the open circles the 1 hr heat shocked
cells, the triangles the 1.5 hr heat shocked cells, and the squares the 2 hr
heat shocked cells. Heat shock was delivered to the cells 24 hr after
plating, as indicated by the arrow.
(B) The percentage of cells surviving 1 hr heat shocks. The filled circles
indicate the control plate, and the open markers indicate two different
plates of 1 hr heat shocks. These plates were heat shocked 48 hr after
plating, again as indicated by the arrow.
