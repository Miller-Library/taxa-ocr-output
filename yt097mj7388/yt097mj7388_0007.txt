post-translational protein stability, any of which may lead to increased levels of proteins,
any of which may have taken place in the GFL cells.
This finding cannot directly be applied to a possible effect of heat shock on the
expression of exogenous DNA, but given that heat shock has an effect on the expression
of endogenous genes, the possibility that heat shock would have a similar effect on
exogenous DNA expression cannot be excluded. In order to resolve the exact role heat
shock is playing in gene expression, further experiments must be done to understand
more completely its effect on these organisms.
