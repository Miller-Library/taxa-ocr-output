assays were also done on cells that were heat shocked 1 hour after injection, but these
likewise resulted in negative staining.
DISCUSSION
No expression of the pNEX-lacZ plasmid was successfully detected in the GFL
cells, and the controls that were run indicate that the lack of expression was not due to
an error in the plasmid. This leaves two possibilities why the expression didn’t work in
the squid cells. One possibility is that the GFL cells cannot be induced by the RSV
promoter to express the exogenous DNA under any circumstances, and a second
possibility is that the injections were not properly done, resulting in low efficiency.
In looking at a study done in parallel with this expression project, however,
another possible factor in expression of exogenous DNA was found. In this study (Gilly,
1992), whole cell voltage clamp experiments were performed on the control and heat
shocked GFL cells of the survivorship experiment. In cells that were heat shocked 48
hours after plating, it was found that over the 24 hours following the temperature stress,
the heat shock induced a four-fold increase in the density of Na channel conductance as
compared to the control plates. Because the GFL cells in the squid normally do not
express Na channels in the somata, (Brismar and Gilly, 1987) thus resulting in cells that
in primary cell culture initially do not contain any Na channels, and because the Na
conductance is proportional to the number of functional Na channels in the cell
membrane, any Na conductance that is detected in these cells is a result of
mappropriately expressed Na channels. Thus, the heat shock in effect caused a four-fold
increase in Na channel protein expression, a dramatic increase.
The mechanism through which this increase is produced is unknown. Morimoto,
lissières, and Georgopoulos have reported a wide ranging effect of heat shock in
protein synthesis, from the transcriptional to translational effects as well as effects on
