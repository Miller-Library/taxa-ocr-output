mM KCI. The injection microelectrodes were made from a glass with similar properties to
the Narishige IM-CFS borosilicate 1 mm OD glass capillaries with filler fibers using either
a Livingston puller (F.S. Hockman) (Gilly, 1978).
Microinjection of Neuroblastoma cells. Differentiated mouse sympathetic
neuroblastoma cells (NIE-115, kindly provided by Sam Wang and Chris Mathes) were
received ready to be injected on glass cover slips, and they were injected with the DNA
solution using the Eppendorf Microinjector. The cells had been differentiated as will be
described. (Mathes et al, 1992) The microelectrodes used for injection were the same as
that for the GFL cells.
Microinjection of Plasmids into Aplysia neurons. The Aplysia californica
abdominal ganglion was dissected, pinned on a Sylgard plate and desheathed in L15
medium (Schacher and Proshansky, 1983) containing an equal volume of artificial sea
water (ASW) of the following composition: 475 mM Nacl, 10 mM KCI, 10 mM CaCl2, 50
MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES. These neurons were injected using a Picospritzer Il
(General Valve Corporation) with the same DNA solution as with the GFL cells, with the
exception that KCl was replaced with Nacl. The injection microelectrodes were made
from World Precision Kwik-Fil glass capillaries (approx. 2 mm ÖD) using a Narishige PE¬
2 electrode puller.
Detection of ß-Galactosidase. The cells were washed 24 hr after
microinjection with Ca-free ASW (the above ASW composition without any CaClo), then
fixed and stained as previously described. (Kaang et al, 1992)
RESULTS
When the GFL cells were injected with the pNEX-lacz gene, no expression of the
ß-galactosidase activity was detected. Öther injection procedures were attempted by
varying the time between the plating of the cells and the injections, the DNA injections
