reading of the microelectrode, as had been done in this set up, just by reading the action
potentials that are detected, being in the cell is ensured.
The gist of this is that even in the Aplysia cells the injections are challenging to
perform. Eric Kandel and Paul Pfaffinger, have likened the injection technique to art, that
with more practice some people get better at it and that some people never get better at
all. The common agreement among the people who perform injections into cells is that
the injections are extremely difficult to master.
