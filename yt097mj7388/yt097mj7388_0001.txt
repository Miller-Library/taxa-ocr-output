ABSTRACT
Although most previous research has not been successful in getting mature,
differentiated neurons to express exogenous DNA, this has reportedly been done in a
variety of neuron types in Aplysia californica using a RSV promoterlenhancer sequence.
This study attempted to express the lacZ gene from Escherichia coli in the giant fiber
lobe (GFL) neurons of squid using this promoterlenhancer. No expression of the B-
galactosidase enzyme was detected in GFL cells or the Aplysia neurons when the cells
were injected with the plasmid, but ÃŸ-galactosidase activity was assayed in
neuroblastoma cells. A probable reason for non-expression of the plasmid in the Aplysia
may be ineffective injection techniques. The non-expression in the GFL cells may be due
to either the injection process or the inability of the cell to be induced by the RSV
promoter. However, one additional factor involved in expression of exogenous DNA was
found. In looking at another study done on GFL cells, it was found that heat shock
increased expression of Na channels. The exact mechanism that is affected to produce
this effect from endogenous genes is unknown, but the effect heat shock may have on
exogenous DNA expression cannot be ignored. And given the differences between the
Aplysia and the squid systems, more studies on the effect of heat shock on these
systems must be done before any definite conclusions may be drawn.
