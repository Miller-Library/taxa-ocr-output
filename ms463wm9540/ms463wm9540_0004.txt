tabulated these sea stars in a separate category since their
feeding behavior could not be determined.
I collected additional feeding data by overturning and
recording any encountered sea stars in 20 m swaths perpendicular
to the cable. These swaths were examined as closely as the
quadrats so that the data would not be skewed to favor more
visible sea stars. The same sea stars may have been tabulated
more than once during the study, but repetition was most likely
uncommon and thus had little effect.
I compared the observed diet to Harrold (1981) by using the
Shannon-Weiner diversity index, the Morista overlap index and the
electivity index of Ivlev (1961). The Shannon-Weiner index was
calculated as H' - -Ep, ln p,, where p, is the proportion of the it
species.
The Morista overlap index was calculated as
22xy,/(Exj'+Ly2), where x, and y, are the proportions of the i
species in the diet in 1996 and 1981 respectively. The electivity
index of Ivlev (1961) was calculated as E' - (D-H)/(D4H), where D
= relative abundance of a given prey species in the diet, and H =
relative abundance of that species in the habitat.
I calculated the mean density of various prey items by
plaging quadrats at random compass bearings and kicks from the
center of the study site. More abundant snails (Tegula spp. and
Calliostoma ligatum) were counted within 0.25 m2 quadrats, 20 for
Tegula and 19 for Calliostoma. Tegula data were supplied by Hunt
(1996). I counted 21 10 mâ€™ circular quadrats for less abundant
species (Astraea gibberosa, Mitra idae, Serpulorbis squamigerus,
