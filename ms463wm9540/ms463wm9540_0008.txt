conservation. Menge (1974) showed how a predaceous snail made
foraging choices to maximize biomass intake per time and decrease
search time. Unpredictability of prey species has also been
linked to generalization of diets and prey choice (Menge 1972).
Harrold (1981) found that regardless of the relative
availability of T. pulligo (high caloric yield) and Petaloconchus
(low caloric yield), some Petaloconchus was always taken. He
hypothesized that this was due to the uncertainty of capturing T.
pulligo, which exhibits an escape response and is often found in a
different microhabitat than Pisaster. The strategy was thus to
always take some abundant but low-energy prey since even abundant
high-energy prey might not be reliably available.
Both species that increased the most in the diet, Balanus and
Serpulorbis, are sessile species, and thus cannot escape a
foraging sea star. Algae and other encrusting organisms found on
the shell of Serpulorbis render it less recognizable (Harrold
1981), but this defensive response is not as effective as that of
mobile snails (such as Calliostoma or T. pulligo). Although these
sessile prey are not now as abundant as Petaloconchus was in 1981,
they are easily captured upon encounter. Thus, the increased
frequency of Balanus and Serpulorbis may reflect an adjustment to
replace Petaloconchus as a predictable energy source.
These results call for further study and more data. Since
the sample size of this study was small, the resolution of
abundance and dietary changes is fairly low. Small frequency
changes could not be detected, and some apparent changes may have
been partly due to sampling error. More feeding data could
