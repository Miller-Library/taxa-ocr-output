correct any such effects and yield more conclusive results.
The role of the sessile polychaetes in Pisaster's diet should
be further explored. Although their increase in the sea star's
diet may be explained by an increase in abundance, more data may
indicate a more precise change which may also stem from the
absence of Petaloconchus. Another unresolved question is the role
of individual variation in the observed differences, as has been
displayed in other predators (West 1986, 1988).
Other methods of characterizing prey availability could be
explored, to see whether the results are comparable. Harrold
(1981) used two distinct methods of measuring abundance, numerical
abundance, counting the number of each species, and encounter
abundance, which factored in the length of each encounter with a
prey species. Encounter abundance would theoretically account for
effects of prey avoiding predation by living in different
microhabitats or other adaptations, which would render these prey
less available than their numerical abundance might suggest. This
method should differentiate between a choice made by a predator
and a simple inability to find and capture prey. However, this
method seems to undersample rare events, since the limitations of
SCUBA prevent long-term observation of sea stars.
Harrold (1981) notes that for many sessile species which do
not exhibit escape behaviors, numerical abundance is an adequate
measure of availability. He noted a small difference in
electivity indices of Serpulorbis based on encounter abundance
rather than numerical abundance, but a smaller difference than for
mobile snails such as T. pulligo and Calliostoma. Thus, for the
