Figure 1: The location of the study site at Hopkins Marine
Station. The hatched area marks the kelp canopy, and the dark
square marks the study site.
Figure 2: Relative frequencies of prey species in the diet of
Pisaster giganteus.
The most frequently eaten prey were Balanus
spp., Serpulorbis squamigerus and polychaete worms.
Percentages
rounded to nearest whole number.
Other" includes Nassarius
mendicus and a mussel.
Figure 3: Changes in diet composition, shown as relative frequengy
in 1996 minus relative frequency in Harrold (1981). The largest
differences in the diet between Harrold (1981) and the results of
my study were in the proportions of Petaloconchus, Serpulorbis,
Balanus and polychaete worms.
Figure 4: Changes in diet compared to changes in abundance for
species with the largest observed dietary change,
Changes in
abundance calculated as relative abundance in 1996 minus relative
abundance in Harrold (1981).
Serpulorbis and Balanus increased
more in the diet than in the habitat, while the increases of
polychaetes and Petaloconchus matched the abundance changes,
Figure 5: Electivity index comparison of several species (Harrold,
unpublished data).
Balanus and Serpulorbis electivity indices
increased, as expected from data in Figure 4.
