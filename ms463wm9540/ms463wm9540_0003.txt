MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted in the kelp forest of the Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge (HMLR), Pacific Grove, California, within an
approximately 40 mx 40 m patch of kelp forest, centered on a
black cable that runs north-south through the kelp (Fig. 1). The
bottom consists mostly of rocky substrate, with some sandy areas,
I limited all data collection to rocky substrate, the preferred
habitat of Pisaster giganteus. Studies were conducted using
SCUBA, in 32 dives between April 23 and May 23, 1996.
The mean density of the sea stars was calculated from 47 10
m' circular quadrats. I placed these quadrats at random locations
by choosing random compass bearings and numbers of kicks (to a
limit of 15) from the center of the study site. I moved quadrats
to the next random location if more than half of the area fell on
sandy substrate. For each sea star I encountered in the quadrat,
I recorded size (length from the tip of the longest arm to the
opposite interradius) and overturned it to determine whether it
was feeding and the number and identity of any prey species. From
this, the proportion of feeding sea stars and the percent of each
prey species in the diet were calculated. Sea stars were returned
to approximately their original position after measurements were
taken.
The main criterion for a feeding observation was an everted
cardiac stomach. Some sea stars had prey items pressed against
the stomach, and others simply had an everted stomach, e.g. if the
prey was attached to the substrate. Several sea stars were in
crevices and inaccessible, and could not be overturned,
