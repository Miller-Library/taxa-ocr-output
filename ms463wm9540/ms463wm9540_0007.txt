Prey species with the greatest changes in the diet were
compared to changes in relative abundance (Fig. 4). Balanus and
Serpulorbis both increased in the diet more than in the habitat
(Balanus abundance actually decreased).
The increase of
polychaetes in the diet was approximately the same as the increase
in abundance, and the disappearance of Petaloconchus was likewise
reflected in both the diet and the habitat. The relative
proportion of prey species in the diet and abundance in the
habitat were used to calculate the electivity indices for each of
the species now (Table 2) and in Harrold (1981) (Table 3). For
the species analyzed in Fig. 4, the electivity indices were
compared (Fig. 5). These indices increased for both Balanus and
Serpulorbis and decreased for polychaetes.
DISCUSSION
The relative frequency of polychaetes in the diet increased
by approximately the same amount as their relative abundance. The
dietary increase of polychaetes can thus be explained by the sea
stars' taking more worms in proportion to their higher
availability, rather than making a choice or adjustment to their
diet. However, the increased relative frequency of Balanus and
Serpulorbis in the diet was larger than any abundance changes,
which suggests another cause.
According to foraging theory, a predator must make choices to
maximize energy input while minimizing effort and difficulty to
gain that energy (Stephens and Krebs 1986). Emlen (1966)
demonstrated this with two species of carnivorous gastropods,
which optimized foraging with respect to time and energy
