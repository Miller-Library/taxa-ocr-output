Ceratostoma foliatum and Conus californica). The abundance of
sessile species that aggregate on rocky substrate (Petaloconchus
montereyensis, Balanus spp., and polychaete worms) were measured
as percent cover, using 15 0.25 m quadrats divided into grids of
25 10 cm x 10 cm squares. The proportion of grid intersections
falling on a given species was used to estimate percent cover.
grouped polychaetes together since I initially did not distinguish
them in the diet. Balanus spp. were rare and thus also counted
individually within 1 m quadrats. Percent cover measurements
were used as estimates of relative abundance for Petaloconchus and
polychaetes, and relative abundance of individually counted prey
species was calculated separately as the density of a prey species
divided by the total density of all prey species in 1 m'.
To eliminate the effects of seasonal variations, only data
from Harrold (1981) taken during spring (late March through June)
were used. Calliostoma abundance numbers were compared to
measurements by Sellers (1977), taken during the same period and
in the same area as Harrold (1981).
RESULTS
During the study, I sampled 130 sea stars, of which 61
(46.93) were feeding. Eleven sea stars (8.53) were lodged in
crevices and inaccessible. The density of Pisaster giganteus was
1.15 + 1.47 per 10 mâ€™ (mean + S.D.), not significantly different
from Watanabe (1984), t.=1.159. Based on size measurements of 124
sea stars, the mean size (+ S.D.) was 13.4 + 3.1 cm.
The most frequently found prey items were the barnacle
Balanus and the vermetid gastropod Serpulorbis, with relative
