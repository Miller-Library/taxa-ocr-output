species highlighted in my study (Balanus, Serpulorbis, and
Petaloconchus), numerical abundance should suffice. However,
using encounter abundance may show whether mobile species also
played a role in replacing Petaloconchus in the diet.
Menge (1972) defined prey availability as the ratio of
calories consumed from a certain prey to calories encountered.
However, since this uses the actual diet numbers, it includes
predator choice, making prey availability a function of the
predator, not simply the prey and environment, unless one assumes
that the diet follows actual availability. My study focused on
response to abundance changes, and caloric data were not
estimated, so this method was not used.
Given the time and methodological limitations of this study,
though, preliminary conclusions suggest that Pisaster giganteus
has compensated for the absence of Petaloconchus by feeding more
frequently on other sessile prey, keeping with the strategy of
maintaining a dependable energy source to offset the risk of not
capturing calorically more attractive prey. Further study should
support these findings.
