frequencies of 28.793 and 22.723 respectively (Fig. 2). No sea
stars were observed feeding on Petaloconchus. The species found
in the diet, in decreasing order of frequency, were Balanus spp.,
Serpulorbis, polychaetes, Tegula pulligo, Calliostoma, Tegula
montereyi, Astraea and Ceratostoma (tie), and Mitra, Nassarius
mendicus and an unidentified mussel (tie).
The diet composition was very similar to Harrold (1981). The
Shannon-Weiner diversity index was 2.029 compared to 2.035
(Harrold, unpublished data). These diets, in terms of actual
species and proportions, also overlapped quite substantially
(Morista index - 0.667). A Chi-square analysis, however, showed a
statistically significant difference between the diets (y=28.3,
po0.005). Qualitatively, the largest differences in the diet
between Harrold (1981) and my study were in the frequencies of
Petaloconchus, Serpulorbis, Balanus and polychaete worms (Fig. 3).
The most abundant individually counted prey species was
Calliostoma, followed by T. pulligo, T. montereyi, T. brunnea,
Serpulorbis, Balanus spp., Mitra, Ceratostoma, Astraea and Conus
(Table 1). No Petaloconchus was encountered while recording
abundance data. Polychaetes had a 6.253 cover.
Only Petaloconchus had a significantly different abundance
from previous measurements (p.0.01, Table 1). No Petaloconchus
was observed in the quadrats, although it was the most abundant
prey species (18.83 cover) in Harrold (1981). A qualitatively
large increase in Serpulorbis abundance was statistically
insignificant.
