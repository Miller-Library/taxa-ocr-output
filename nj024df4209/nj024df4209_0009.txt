Encrusting mounds use the leaning strategy most often because
it conforms most usefully with their mushroom-like structure. They
are able to root down in an area, and then extend their tunic, with
zooids, beyond their point of attachment. The soft, jelly-like
composition of their tests (also like that of A. californicum) probably
facilitiates faster growth rates, so when they come into contact
with a dominant encrusting sheet like A. psammion, they are not as likely
to be overgrown because they grow taller and faster. The combined
use of these strategies also proves to be effective when in contact with
the less aggressive lobe and social colonial species, as is indicated by
the direction of the arrows on Table 5.
Lobes
Compound ascidians found in lobe forms are efficient with their use
of space due to their small point of attachment which is able to support
a large colony in very little space. Their only real aggressive
strategy is the ability to crowd out another species with a large
colony of lobes, though laboratory observations have not shown this
response to be as quick as the growth rate of encrusting sheets or
mounds. Lobes may also be successful when they use encrusting sheets
as substrate by settling on and embedding into them. When confronted
with an aggressive neighbor, the lobes will respond (except A. arenatum)
by leaning and growing away from the neighbor, a form of displacement.
The hard, sand-encrusted tests of the sandy lobe species, A. propinquum.
A. arenatum, and Synoicum, serves the same protective purposes as
it does for A. psammion.
