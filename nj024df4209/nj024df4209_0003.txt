RESULTS
The results of the field study detailing competitive interactions and
the observations from sectioning interactive borders are summarized in
Table 1. The interactions are listed by pairs of species of ascidians,
They are classified by growth strategies (as introduced in the discussion),
and the relative proportion of times that a given response was observed
out of all contacts analyzed is listed. The results of the growth
responses observed from the laboratory experiment done on glass
plates are presented in Table 2 for comparison. The following is a
description of the common interactions, categorized by growth forms.
Encrusting Sheets Meeting Encrusting Sheets
Colonies of Aplidium californicum met frequently since the species
is abundant and occurs in a variety of habitats and tidal heights. It
was never observed to overgrow another colony of the same species in the
field,and the colonies would meet and maintain their borders, frequently
accumulating sand in the space between contiguous colonies. However,
when two colonies were paired on glass plates, overgrowth without fusing,
was observed.
In all observed contacts, A. Californicum grew over Archidistoma
psammion. When overgrown, A. psammion often had a thick test, encrusted
with sand and empty of zooids in the area of overgrowth, but it might
also have been unaffected. A. californicum colonies moved 8 mm and
overgrew colonies of A. psammion in seven days on glass plates.
Due to its large range, A. psammion met often in the field with
colonies of the same species, one-third of the time growing over it.
Whether they met or overlapped, they had thick, zooidless tests in the
area of contact that were often encrusted with sand. On glass plates
when two A. psammion colonies were paired, the colonies spread out but
