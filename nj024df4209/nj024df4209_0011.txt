2. A general hierarchy of successful competitors based upon growth forms
can be presented (in order of greatest to least success):
Encrusting sheets, encrusting mounds, social colonials, and lobeÂ¬
shaped species. Within these categories, however, there are exceptions,
so that growth forms alone cannot be considered as a universal
factor for determining competitive success.
3. Rate of asexual reproduction, or colony growth rate, based upon
a list of individual species, can also be used to produce a
hierarchy of successful competitors; however, this conclusion would
be even less accurate if applied to all ascidians, and thus
can only be considered as a secondary factor influencing competitive
success.
4.
Composition of the test, ranging from hardness to softness, because
it has an effect bo on otective and growth abilities, has a
correlation with competitive ability.
5. Protective as well as aggressive strategies are at work during
space competition between ascidians, leading to a complex community
structure.
6. The diversity of species present and the community and the complex
structure of their distribution is a result of the variety
of competitive tactics utilized by the individual ascidian.
