Social Colonials
The main strategy of the social colonial ascidian, who is structurally
much more fragile than any other growth form, is its ability to reproÂ¬
duce asexually very quickly, as seen on glass plates in the laboratory.
This allows them to occupy alot of space in a short amount of time
evade overgrowth, and even crowd out another species on occasion. The
social colonials are also very succcessful, more so than the lobe species,
at using other growth forms (including lobes) for substrate. This
is a highly advantageous strategy for such easily damaged ascidians.
The overall diversity of the rocky intertidal can be attributed at
least in part to the variety of differen tially successful competitive
strategies used by the organisms within the community structure (Buss
and Jackson, 1979). The species' structure, composition, longevity,
and growth rate all contribute to its overall success against other
ascidians. By using these varying combinations of factors as well
as others not investigated, most species are equipped with the means
to survive even in the toughest neighborhoods. Diversity in the pattern
of distribution of intertidal tunicates may well be the result of
this variability of competitive strategies between species, between
their effectiveness in different habitats and the life history
strategies of growth rate, longevity and successful recruitment.
SUMMARY
1. Strategies for space competion between species of colonial
ascidians were studied in the rocky intertidal of Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California.
