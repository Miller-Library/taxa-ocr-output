The purpose of this study was to examine the competitive associations
between colonial ascidians at Cabrillo Point and evaluate competitive
strategies. Classification of species followed the categories of
growth forms in order to determine a relationship between structure and
competitive strategy. Finally, growth forms were evaluated according
to their competitive abilities.
METHODS
The study was conductedin the intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station,
Cabrillo Pt., Pacific Grove, California in April and May of 1981. The
study area was located northwest of Bird Rock and sites were chosen
for high tunicate density and variation in physical conditions of
exposure and tidal height. Thirteen undisturbed areas were photographed
weekly over a four week period of time to note any changes that occur
in the field over time. Other areas were observed for ongoing competitive
interactions and selected borders between ascidians were sectioned and
examined under a dissecting scope to observe the results of previous
competitive interactions.
Two follow-up experiments were performed to lead to an understanding
of growth strategies of individual species.
1. Entire colonies of different species were brought from the field
and tied down onto glass plates,alone and in species pairs. Responses
were observed, and each plate was photographed over time.
2. In the field, eight species were isolated by removing all vegetÂ¬
ation and invertebrates that were within a two-inch radius around the
colonies, and these were photographed over time.
In both experiments, colony sizes were traced from photos and compared
over time.
