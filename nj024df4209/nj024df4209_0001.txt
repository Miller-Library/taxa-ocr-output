INTRODUCTION
Competition among benthic marine invertegrates revolves importantly
around finding a place to settle and, maintaining that space and acquiring
new space for growth during the life of the organism (Connell,1961;
Dayton, 1971; Jackson,1977; Paine, 1974). Buss and Jackson's examination
of associations and interactions of coral reef invertebrates (1979).
Connell's account of interspecific competition among barnacles, as well
as Dayton's study of community organization (1971) introduced experÂ¬
imental approaches to a previously descriptive field. Their research
has suggested that competition for space in the intertidal is complex,
involving definite adaptive strategies.
Colonial animals from such groups as sponges, coelenterates, bryozoa,
and tunicates are often found as the dominant animal cover on benthic
substrates. Jackson (1977) makes the case for the strategy of the
indeterminate growth and acquisition of space by asexual reproduction
of these colonial forms being one of the most effective methods of
space competition. The colony can survive damage and continue to
spread (Buss, 1979). Thus the abundant and diversified colonial ascidians
are an interesting group to examine for competitive interactions for
living space.
In the rocky intertidal regions of the mid-California coast, full
utilization of all available space by competing algae and invertebrates,
both solitary and colonial, shows the importance of space in the
community. That so many competitors here are colonial gives reason to
believe they are successful (Jackson 1977). The lower intertidal is
marked by the presence of colonial ascidians who occupy a significant
portion of the rocky substrate (Morris, Abbott and Haderlie, 1980).
