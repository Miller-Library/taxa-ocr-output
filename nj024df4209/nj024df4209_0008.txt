these observations for the intertidal ascidians examined for this study.
The strategies are discussed below in relation to their effectiveness,
and the summary of their success is presented in Table 5 in the form
of a dominance matrix.
Sheets
Among the growth forms of ascidians, encrusting sheets show relatively
good competitive abilities (Buss, 1979), as evidenced by the large
anomt of space they occupy in the intertidal (Pulliam, 1981).
Encrusting sheets use the most direct techniques for obtaining space:
by creating new substrate out of living ascidians through overgrowth.
In the case of A. californicum, growth rate, on top of structure, is
an important strategy influencing competitive success. Both on glass
plates and in the field, this seasonal ascidian showed the fastest
increase in colony size of all the species examined. Though it has a
low stature on the substrate interms of height which would make it
easy for a mound species to lean over it, A. californicum was determined
to be the most dominant species because it grows faster than any other
species it was observed to come in contact with (Buss, 1979; Buss and
Jackson, 1979). No other species was ever observed to overgrow or
lean onto A. californicum.
On the other hand, A. psammion, the other very common encrusting
sheet, showed very slow growth rates in the field and on glass plates.
Its thick test is unsuitable for fast growing, so it is often susceptÂ¬
ible to the leaning of the mound species who grow both taller and
faster. The growth-limiting tunic, though, possesses protective
features which also serve as stra egic advantages. The thick test
is hardened by sand encrustation and acts as a barrier to movement
by the softer species and as a protective shield for the zooids
