A. psammion would displace, but rarely overgrow, Synoicum and A. propin-
quum lobes. Both of these sandy lobes, and colonies of Polyclimum planum,
were commonly observed to use A. psammion as substrate while A. arenatum
did not. Most often, A. arenatum was surrounded by A. psammion, or
the sandy lobe was observed leaning over the encrusting sheet - in
which case the test of Archidistoma psammion was thick and sand
encrusted.
Lobe-shaped Species with Encrusting Mounds
In general, the sandy lobes most commonly were found being leaned
upon and overgrown by the mound species, A. solidum,A. molle, or
A. diaphanes. The lobes were usually displaced,and the mound species
frequently had a thick layer of test at these borders. The mounds were
never used as substrate by the lobes.
Social Colonials, In General
A. californicum was the only species that was observed to overgrow
any of the social colonials, and this was Clavelina huntsmani. Since
its growth only extended around the base of the Clavelina colony,
no damage was observed. Frequently, both Clavelina and Euherdmania
claviformes attached stolons to colonies of A. psammion, using it
as substrate, but these social colonial species were more often displaced
when located at the borders of this encrusting sheet.
When in contact with species of encrusting mounds, both Clavelina
and Euherdmania either showed no response or were displaced. When
social colonials were in contact with lobes, they were generally tolÂ¬
erant, and showed little competitive interaction. In the field, when
Euherdmania and Clavelina come in contact, they showed no visible
