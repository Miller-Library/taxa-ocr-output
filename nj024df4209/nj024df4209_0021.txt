TABLE LEGENDS
Table 1:
Responses of species combinations of colonial ascidians based
upon field observations and sections of interactive borders. Numbers
indicate the proportion of a response occurring for that interaction.
Blanks indicate that the response was not observed. Thick test = given
species had a layer of thick test with a conspicuous lack of zooids at
the border of interaction; sand encrusted = bordering test was sand encrusted;
loose sand - sand in between the two colonies, not encrusted;
displacement = given specieswas displaced by neighbor species; projection -
given species, tunic and zooids, was leaning over neighbor species;
overgrowth = given species was growing over the other species, but
was also attaded to primary substrate; 2Â° substrate = given species was
using other species as substrate; other zooids = presence of zooids of
given species in the test of the other species; budding = buds were
attached to the species. Damage was rated on the following scale :
O = no damage; 1 = slight damage (lack of zooids, very thick test);
2 - significant damage (no zooids, deterioration of test); 3 = death.
No response = interaction had no visible effect on either colony.
*The tracings of these colonies appear in the appendix.
Table 2:
Responses of species combinations of colonial ascidians removed
from the field and tied to glass plates. + = given response was observed;
- = opposite of given response was observed; blank indicates that the
response was not observed. Expansion = size of the colony increased;
overgrowth = given species grew over neighbor species; projection =
given species leaned over other species; spreading = systems within the
