response to each other, but their stolons were all intermingled at the
base of the colonies.
Perophora annectens, (with the exception of A. molle) extended its
stolons out over the tunic of the neighbor colonies it encountered, and
the neighbor colony showed no response to the interaction.
All of the social colonial species exhibited budding in contact
situations and did no damage to the colony they bordered.
Of the colonies isolated in the field or placed singly on glass
plates, all increased their colony sizes within ten days, except
Synoicum parfustis, Archidistoma diaphanes, and Clavelina huntsmani.
Results are summarized in Table 3 with sample growth plates in the
Appendix.
A. californicum showed the fastest increase in size. A. californicum,
A. molle, and A. solidum showed the fasted repair to damage done by the
string used to tie down the colonies with. Repair consisted of
separating the tunic and zooids at the point of contact with the
string and moving the test up and around the string until it was
completely covered. The colony appeared normal after covering the
string.
Rearrangement of zooid systems was observed in both A. californicum
and A. solidum. In A.californicum, systems would spread out, and more
test was observed in between systems. The systems of A. solidum broke
apart into lobes.
Clavelina, when isolated on glass plates, was observed to have
grown buds that were two to seven millameters long within two weeks.
