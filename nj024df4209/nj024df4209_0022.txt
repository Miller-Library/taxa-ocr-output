colony spread out, bec me less dense within the test. *The tracings
of these colonies appear in the appendix.
Table 3 :
A summary of the responses of colonial ascidians to isolation, both by
clearing borders in the field and tying colonies on glass plates. Colony
area was determined by tracing photographs and calculating the area
within the tracing. + = the change in colony size of these species was
positive, yet not determinable by tracing. *The tracings of these
isolated colonies appear in the appendix.

List of all species classified according to growth forms with compet¬
itive strategies summarized for each growth form.
Table 5:
A matrix of dominance of ascidian species observed in the field.
Dominance, indicated by the direction of the arrow, was determined
through observations and sectioning interactive borders.— - direction
of dominance;+ - both share dominance, but empty arrow less often
than blackened arrow;dominance is approximately equalrelation-
ship was only observedon glass plates;almost total dominance,
occasionally, the other species won;()-no observable effects of the
interaction; blank indicates that the interaction was not seen.
