grew too slowly to note any response to neighboring colonies.
Encrusting Sheets Meet Encrusting Mounds
Interactive borders of A. psammion and Archidistoma molle were often
found. Both leaned and overgrew each other with the same frequency
while A. psammion zooids were occasionally found at the base of the tunic
of A. molle. The test of A. psammion, when underneath an A. molle
colony was thick and empty of zooids. When colonies were paired on
glass plates, A. molle projected its tunic over A. psammion and attached
to it.
When colonies of Aplidium solidum and A. psammion grew together
in the field, the outcome was quite variable with displacement, leaning
and mutual overgrowth all occurring. Both colonies responded to the
contact with thicker, sand-encrusted tests, and sand was found in between
the two colonies.
In the field, when colonies of A. californicum overgrew both
mound species, A. solidum and Archidistoma diaphanes, the mounds
showed empty and deteriorating tunics. A.solidum was also observed
to have a thick test, sometimes encrusted with sand. Colonies of
A. californicum and A. molle were never observed to meet in the field
but when paired on glass plates, colonies of A. californicum were seen
to spread out zooid systems and overgrow the adjacent colony of A. molle.
The same results were seen when A. californicum was paired with
A. solidum on glass plates.
Lobe-shaped Species Meet Encrusting Sheets
A. californicum was observedto overgrow the sandy-lobed species,
Synoicum parfustis, Aplidium propinquum, and Aplidium arenatum.
