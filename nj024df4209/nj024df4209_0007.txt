All colonies flattened out onto the plates within one week, and
fusion to the glass plates occurred within two weeks. When groups
of colonies of A. molle or A. psammion were isolated in the field,
the colonies would move closer together when different competing
species were removed from between them.
DISCUSSION
In observing the variety of interactions involved in space competitÂ¬
ion between the intertidal colonial ascidians, it became apparent that
there was a relationship between the growth formsof the ascidians and
the strategies empled. This led to classifying the colonies into
four categories: 1)encrusting sheets, 2) encrusting mounds, 3) lobe-shaped
colonies, and 4)social colonials. Encrusting sheets are compound
colonials that are often large, cortinuous colonies that sit low on
the surface of their substrate. Encrusting mounds are compound
species that are attached to the substrate and slightly "mushroom'
out beyond their attachment, usually growing taller than the sheets.
Lobes are attached to the substrate at one small point at their bases,
and the remainder of the colony is projected outwards. Social colonials
are groups of individuals that are attached at the base by stolons which
often include parts of the colony's circulatory system, in contrast to
compound ascidians that are composed of a group of individuals bound
together in a common test.
Each of these groups has a distinctive set of competitive strategies
though individual members of the set may be shared with other growth
forms. In addition, each strategy may be developed to different
degrees by species of the same or different groups. Table 4 summarizes
