Introduction
Tegula pulligo (Gmelin, 1791) is a common subtidal
snail inhabiting both the rock substrate and Macrocystis
pyrifera (Linnaeus). Lowry, McElroy, and Pearse (1974)
studied the distribution of the six common trochid gas¬
tropods and found <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. pulligo</span> to occur predominantly in
deeper water and when associated with <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>Macrocystis</span> to in¬
habit the lower portions of the plant. No mention was
made of changes in the distribution over time. D.E. Hunt
(1977) studied the distribution of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula : Exact'>Tegula</span> on Macrocystis
over a one year period and reported seasonal differences.
He also documented changes in the position of individual
snails over time periods ranging from one hour to one
month. In this study, T. pulligo was observed and analyzed
for rhythmic activity on a diel basis. The study was done
in the months of April and May in the kelp forest off
Mussel Pt., Ca. (Hopkins Marine Station). A diel vertical
migration was discovered -- snails occupying a higher
position on the kelp plants during periods of dark than
during daylight hours. The extent of this movement and
the actual distribution was found to vary with ocean and
light conditions.

Methods
A study are was set up near the 130M mark on the per¬
manent transect that runs through the HMS kelp forest in
7-8M of water. Twenty plants were labeled with lettered
plastic tags and used throughout the investigation.
Data was collected by dividing the plant into meter
intervals and tabulating the number of snails in each depth
interval. Care was taken to avoid dislodging any snails
so that the same plants could be monitored for periods of
several days. Night observations were made with a hand¬
held underwater light.
A total of 25 dives were made of approximately 45 min¬
utes each for the purposes of counting snails. These were
between the dates of April 13 and June 2, 1978.
Marked snails were used for one study. This entailed
stripping a plant and bringing the snails to shore where
numbered tags were epoxied to the apex of their shell.
They were released on the same plant within three hours
by placing them in small baskets tied just above the spor¬
ophylls (.3-.4M). 24 hours or more were allowed for the
snails to redistribute themselves on the plant before
further observation was made.
Experiments were also done in an outdoor aquarium
(measuring .92 x.92 x .62M) which contains a kelp plant
constructed of .6M long fronds. Screening was placed over
(3)
the tank in order to lower the light intensity to a point
comparable to that found in the intermediate depths of the
kelp forest (within an order of amgnitude, 250 ft-candles
at noon). Replicate studies were done using up to thirty
snails. Observations involved marking the position of
individuals at either one or two hour intervals using a
coordinate system set up on the edges of the aquarium.

Results
The distribution of T. pulligo on Macrocystis pyrifera
was found to change significantly over a 24 hour period.
A compilation of field data taken between April 13 and May
(fig.1) showed that 62% of the Tegula population censused
occupied the bottom meter of the plants during the hours
from 0800-1200. The majority being concealed in the dense
sporophylls. At night only 25% of the population was in
this interval; the snails had distributed themselves more
evenly throughout the plant. An RxC test of independence
(Rohlf and Sokal, 1969) comparing the six frequency distri¬
butions in fig.l gave a G-value of 226.64 (with n=25, P(.005).
Therefore one rejects the null hypothesis that the distri¬
bution does not change over the 24 hour period. A compar¬
ison between the two extremes, 0800-1200 and 2000-2400,
was also significant using the same test (G=71.75, n=5,
P .005). The mean height of all the snails on the kelp
plant rose 1.1M on the average over the period of obser¬
vation (t.-8.38).
In a second study which followed the distribution
of marked snails on the same palnts by sampling at noon
and midnight (fig.2), the mean height rose and fell during
night and day respectively, over a 48 hour period. T-tests
for a comparison between two means (Rohlf and Sokal, 1969)
applied to consecutive points and successive noon and mid¬
night observations all prove significant at-.05. The
(5)
RxC test shows the distribution to be significantly heter¬
ogeneous over time (G=66.58, n=20, P.005). Observations
on marked individuals during one rising phase showed that
13/17 moved up at least one meter interval, 4/17 were un¬
changed and zero moved down. During two falling phases
19/32 moved down (some as much as three meters), 9/32 were
unchanged and 4/32 moved down.
Aquarium studies (fig.3) show a significant increase
in the mean height at night (t!=4.01) as well as a sig¬
nificant peak of locomotion during the hours immediately
after dawn (t!=2.63). The greatest increase in activity
occurs in the period following sunset.

Discussion
Field monitoring of T. pulligo in a protected portion
of the Hopkins Marine Station kelp forest reveals a diel
vertical migration on the stipes of Macrocystis pyrifera,
up at night and down during the day. The vertical distri¬
bution and the amount of movement varied, though, through¬
out the investigation.
The distribution was more skewed to the bottom in the
April studies and less in the final field study. This
correlates well with differences in the field conditions.
The ocean was rough and surgey in April and calm in May.
Hunt (1977) reports lower vertical distributions during
months when storms were more prevalent compared to those
months of relative calm. He also mentions increases in
the benthic population of Tegula after storms. It seems
that the action of surge causes attrition, via loss, from
the higher portions of the plant. In the final field
study (fig.2), the mean height rises on successive days
and nights possibly correlating with the lack of surge.
This was a time of virtually no seas and therefore low
attrition (numbers of snails were observed to rise on
individual plants).
A second variable is the light conditions in the kelp
forest. Both the increase in the density of the kelp can¬
opy and the presence of plankton blooms in May caused
visibility to drop and hence light intensity. (Noon readings
on May 9 showed a gradient of approximately 100 ft-candles
(7)
on the bottom and greater than 750 ft-candles 3M below
the surface. On June 2 at noon, the gradient was from 5
ft.-candles on the bottom to 90 ft-candles 3M below the
surface.) If changing light intensity as occurs at dawn
and dusk is a cue for vertical migration (as it appears
from aquarium studies, fig.3; and Verwey, 1966), less
change in intensities between day and night would cause
less vertical movement. Comparing fig.l to fig.2, the
changes in the mean height over 24 hour periods are
greater for the data collected earlier in the investigation
when the light gradient was larger. This supports the idea
that differences in the light gradient may cause differences
in the amount of vertical movement. It appears that surge
is primarily responsible for seasonal differences in the
distribution on the kelp plants, and the light gradient is
responsible for the extent of migration on a daily basis.
However, this separation of variables is premature and awaits
more quantitative data on surge and light conditions.
What is the selective advantage for this vertical
movement? Here more research needs to be done. Since
the main predators of Tegula occuring on Macrocystis are
fish and sea otters (Hunt,1977; Vandewere,1969), there
would be an advantage to seeking light levels where the
foraging of such predators would be less effective. At
night, snails could move freely, grazing on the blades
(which is observed at night) only to reseek lower light
levels during the day. The number of snails in the
(8)
sporophylls does decrease at night indicating an emergence
into other parts of the plant (this was demonstrated by
movements of marked snails and by an increase in the num¬
ber of snails in the stipes above the sporophylls during
their upward migration). Illustrative experiments would
be those that could demonstrate different predation rates.
Summary
1. T.pulligo exhibits a diel vertical migration on the stipes
of Macrocystis pyrifera.
2. The actual distribution and the extent of migration appear
to be influenced by surge and light conditions in the
kelp forest.
3. Aquarium studies indicate a negative response to light
as well as showing increased activity of T. pulligo
during periods just after dawn and dusk. These obser¬
vations implicate changing light conditions as a cue
for initiation of migration.
