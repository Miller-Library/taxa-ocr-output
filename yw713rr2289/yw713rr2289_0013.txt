Point Pinos generally tend to contain less chromium than do those
on Mussel Point by the Hopkins Marine Station. It is possible
that this tendency is due to the higher concentration of chromium
in the seawater off Mussel Point. Water here, however, was not
compared to seawater in other localities. It is also possible
that Pacific Grove sewage effluent has some influence on the
ability of Point Pinos ascidians to concentrate chromium. Al-
though it has been shown to lack detectable amounts of this
heavy metal, Pacific Grove sewage effluent flows into the ocean
as fresh water 1-2Â°C warmer than the seawater at Point Pinos.
Furthermore, in the period of the present study this sewage
at the outfall itself was found to contain residual chlorine
levels up to 45 ppm. Perhaps one or more of the components of this
sewage lowers the chromium-concentrating capacity of the Point
Pinos ascidians. Another possibility is that the plankton con-
sumed by the ascidians is being affected by the sewage. While
the exact mechanism by which ascidians concentrate heavy metals
is still debatable, it has been suggested that since chromium
exists in such low concentrations in the open ocean, ascidians
may acquire this metal in a preconcentrated form in their
plankton meals (Levine, 1962).
SUMMARY
1. Eighteen species of ascidians taken near Monterey, Cal-
ifornia, were analysed for chromium content using atomic absorp-
tion spectrophotmetry.
2. The highest values (ppm dry weight) were found in the
