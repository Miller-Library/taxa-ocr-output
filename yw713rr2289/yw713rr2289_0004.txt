solution that was used in making up the samples. Working
curves, showing absorbance (derived from per cent absorp
tion) plotted against ppm chromium, were used in determining
concentrations of chromium in the samples. Appendix 1 shows
one of the working curves obtained from the chromium standards.
Fresh standard solutions were made up and tested prior to ana-
lysing each group of ascidian samples. Since each 0.5 g ashed
aliquot was dissolved in 25 ml of solution, the sample concen-
trations read off the working curves were multiplied by 50 in
order to obtain values in parts per million per gram of ash.
Since glassware at the Hopkins Marine Station is cleaned
with a solution of potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid,
all of the beakers, flasks, and pipets used in these experi-
ments were submerged in a solution of concentrated nitric and
sulfuric acids for 15 minutes, then rinsed 6 times with tap-
water, in order to prevent any chromium contamination.
Control samples were prepared and tested for chromium to
ascertain that no contamination was occurring at any stage of
sample preparation. Tapwater, deionized water,aand the O.1 N
HCl (the "blank") were all tested with the spectrophotometer
and found to lack chromium. A 50 ml beaker was spared the usual
washing with concentrated acid and filled with 25 ml of the
0.1 N HCl; this control, which might have shown contamination
resulting from the washing procedure at the Hopkins Marine
Station, also exhibited no chromium content when tested. One
beaker was run through the gamut of sample preparation proce-
dures and found to contain no chromium. Finally, the aqua re-
