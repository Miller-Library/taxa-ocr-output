CHROMIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN TUNICATES (UROCHORDATA: ASCIDIACEA)
TAKEN NEAR MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA; RELATION TO LOCAL SEWAGE
OUTFALLS

Ascidians are known to concentrate such heavy metals as
titanium, vanadium, niobium, and chromium in levels that tremen-
dously exceed the concentrations of these elements in the surround-
ing seawater (Webb, 1939; Bertrand, 1950; Carlisle, 1958; Le-
vine, 1962). Chromium is a common constituent of industrial
sewage, and it may at times constitute part of domestic sewage.
Monterey, Bay, California, has a number of both industrial and
domestic sewage outfalls. Using atomic absorption spectropho-
tometry, a study was made of the chromium content of ascidians
living in the Monterey area to determine the chromium levels
present in different species and to see whether intraspecific
variations in chromium content might be correlated with the lo-
cations of selected sewage outfalls.
MATERIALS and METHODS
Eighteen species of ascidians were taken from the follow-
ing four locations near Monterey: the floats at the marina in
Monterey harbor; the rocky shore by the Hopkins Marine Station
in Pacific Grove; the rocky shore at Point Pinos, Pacific
Grove, 50 to 100 feet from the opening of the city sewage outfall;
and the rocky shore south of the mouth of the Carmel River,
