gia was tested and it, too, showed a lack of chromium.
Neither the acid solution used in washing the glassware
nor the concentrated hydrogen peroxide were run through
the spectrophotometer, however.
Samples of sewage effluent were obtained from local
sewage treatment plants (Monterey, Pacific Grove, and Car-
mel) and analysed for chromium using the method of additions.
In this procedure, matrix interference is obviated by adding
increasing amounts of chromium to a series of sewage samples;
the atomic absorption readings are plotted against the
chromium additions (Figures 1-4), and the line connecting
the points extrapolated to the abscissa. The distance of
this intersection to the left of the zero point of additions
on the abscissa represents the chromium concentration in the
unadulterated sample.
RESULTS and DISCUSSION
Monterey sewage sampled on May 29, 1970, contained
approximately 0.008 ppm of chromium (Figure 1). No chromium
was detected in the sewage effluents of Pacific Grove and
Carmel (Figures 2 and 3). Seawater taken from the east shore
of the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove contained
0.095 ppm of chromium (Figure 4). The open ocean contains
about 0.00005 ppm of chromium (Goldberg, 1963).
Chromium levels found in the eighteen species of ascidians
tested are tabulated in Appendix 2 and summarized in Table 1.
The ascidians tested contained chromium levels (ppm dry weight)
