regia were added to each beaker. Samples were heated to
dryness over a steam bath. Next, 2-3 ml of cold, concen-
trated (30%) hydrogen peroxide were added to each beaker, and
the samples were again completely evaporated over a steam bath.
Finally, 3 ml of aqua regia were added to each sample and this
evaporated as before. All samples contained distinct crystals
of digested material at this time.
Samples were redissolved in 10 ml of O.1 N HCl (prepared
with deionized distilled water). This solution was poured
into a 50 ml beaker. An additional 10 ml of the O.1 N HCI
was used to rinse the 15 ml beaker, and this was also added
to the 50 ml beaker. This 20 ml of solution, which often
contained considerable undigested material, was filtered through
5 Whatman filter paper to remove macroscopic suspended mater-
ial and larger pieces of sand and unidentified micaceous grit.
An additional 5 ml of O.1 N HCl was used to rinse the 50 ml
beaker and was filtered with the rest of the sample.
The 25 ml of filtrate representing each sample was col-
lected in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask and tested for chromium
using a Perkin-Elmer Model 303 atomic absorption spectropho-
tometer equipped with a three-slot burner head and an air-
acetylene flame. The detection limit of this instrument is
about 0.004 ppm chromium and the sensitivity (concentration
needed to produce 1% absorption) was sometimes as great as
0.0713 ppm chromium. Standard solutions, containing 1, 5, 10,
15, and 20 ppm chromium, were made up using a Beckman stock
solution of 1000 ppm chromium (prepared especially for atom-
ic absorption procedures), diluted with the same O.1 N HCI
