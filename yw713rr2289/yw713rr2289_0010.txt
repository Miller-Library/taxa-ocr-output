at least 31,800 times, and in some species as much as
3,050,000 times, that in seawater in the open ocean. Species
of Synoicum, Ritterella, and Eudistoma were found to contain
the highest levels of chromium. These genera are all members
of the Order Aplousobranchia; this fact is of particular
interest, since the ascidians showing high levels of vanadium
fall mainly in the Order Phlebobranchia (Webb, 1939; Bertrand,
1950). Within Orders and Families of ascidians there is consid-
erable variation in the tendency to concentrate chromium. How-
ever, all samples of Eudistoma species contained relatively
high concentrations of chromium, whereas samples of Amaroucium
species were consistently lower. The levels found in Eudistoma
ritteri (zooids plus tunic) are somewhat lower than those ob-
tained by Levine (1961), who found 72-144 ppm (dry weight) for
whole zooids, and 100 ppm for zooid abdomens only.
It is apparent (Table 1) that chromium levels in ascidians
taken near sewage outfalls were generally lower than those in
ascidians collected in an area considered unpolluted (Mussel
Point, Hopkins Marine Station). In the case of the ascidians
taken from the region of the Carmel outfall (indicated by an
asterisk in Table 1), it is possible that the low levels reflect
a difference in procedure. These animals were prepared in the
same general way as the others, but were ashed for 24 hours
at 475°C instead of the usual 8-12 hours at 450°0, and the
low chromium values here may be due to vaporization of some
chromium-containing component of the ash. Since these values
appear abnormally low, they are not considered further here.
