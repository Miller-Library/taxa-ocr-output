500 to 1000 feet from the opening of the city of Carmel
sewage outfall. No ascidians were found living less than 50 feet
from the Pacific Grove outfall and 500 feet from the Carmel
outfall, although the rocks nearer to the outfalls appeared,
but for the sewage, very suitable for ascidian habitation.
Living solitary and colonial ascidians were picked clean
of gross extraneous material and placed in finger bowls
filled with millipore-filtered seawater to allow the gut to
clear. The water was changed 2-3 times daily and the bowls
maintained at about 14째0. The intestines of the ascidians were
usually empty of feces within 48 hours, but some of the smaller
ascidians (e.g., Clavelina huntsmani) closed their siphons in
filtered seawater and never thoroughly evacuated. The large
solitary ascidians (e.g., Styela, Ciona, and Ascidia) gener-
ally proved much hardier than the smaller colonial species.
After the ascidians were removed from the filtered seawater,
all external adhering material was picked and scraped from
the tunics as thoroughly as possible. An approximate wet
weight was obtained, then the ascidians were either chopped up
by hand or ground for several minutes in a Waring blendor. The
chopped or ground samples were placed in 50 ml beakers and
dried for 12-18 hr at 110째C to constant weight. A dry weight
(to the nearest mg) was obtained for each sample. Samples were
then ashed in a muffle furnace at 450째C for 8-12 hrs (24 hrs
at 475째C for some samples, see Table 1) and weighed again.
Aliquots of the ashed samples (usually O.5 g) were taken,
weighed (to the nearest mg) in 15 ml beakers, and 3 ml of aqua
