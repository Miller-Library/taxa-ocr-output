genera Eudistoma (E. psammion, 152.5; E. ritteri, 25.6; E.
molle, 15.0), Synoicum, (Synoicum par-fustus, 83.6), and
Ritterella (R. pulchra, 69.6; R. rubra, 45.2). All are mem-
bers of the Order Aplousobranchia. The lowest value was ob-
tained in Styela montereyensis (1.59 ppm dry weight). Seawater
taken by the Hopkins Marine Station yielded a value of 0.095
ppm.
3. The chromium content of ascidians found near local
domestic sewage outfalls was often lower than that of ascidians
found in less polluted areas. The chromium concentration in
three different samples of domestic sewage effluent (ranging
from 0.000 to 0.008 ppm) was much lower than that in seawater
from Monterey Bay.(0.095 ppm).
