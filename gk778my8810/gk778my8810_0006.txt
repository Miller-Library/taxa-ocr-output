The percentage distribution of the various nitro¬
genous compounds, based upon mean values, is shown in
Table 2. The comparison between the five species indicates
that relatively more ammonia is excreted by Acmaea dig¬
italis and A. scabra, that less uric acid is excreted
by A. digitalis, and that A. scabra and A. scutum excrete
less urea. It can also be seen that greater than 80%
of the total nonprotein nitrogen can be accounted for
by these methods.
Gaseous ammonia was found to be excreted in the five
species of Acmaea examined with the dry diffusion tech¬
nique described above. Those forms found higher in the
intertidal zone, A. scabra and A digitalis, produced
more of the gaseous product than the lower intertidal
forms, A. scutum, A. limatula, and A pelta. The mean
value after 24 hours was 2.9 ug NH,-N for the higher
species and 2.0 ug NH-N for the lower ones.
DISCUSSION
The microdiffusion and colorimetric techniques,
coupled with the collection procedure, haveprovided a
means of analysis of individual specimens of the genus
Acmaea. The extreme standard deviations obtained (eg.,
in A. digitalis, NH,-N 8.9 + 8.3 ug) indicate very large
individual differences. The deviations did not result
from the assay procedure, which, as previously indicated,
