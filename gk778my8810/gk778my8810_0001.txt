BARIBAULT, WILLIAM H. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University, Pacific Grove, California). Nitrogen
Excretory Products in the Limpet Acmaea (Mollusca:
Gastropoda: Prosobranchia). The Veliger
Nitrogen excretory products were examined in the genus
Acmaea by a microdiffusion technique for urea and ammonia and
a colorimetric technique for uric acid. Five species were
examined, varying in vertical distribution. Similar concenÂ¬
trations of ammonia, urea, and uric acid were found in all five
species. A large amount of intraspecific varition in the
distribution of these compounds was noted, especially in the
high intertidal forms Acmaea scabra and Acmaea digitalis. These
variations might reflect individual differences in enzyme
activity, individual differences in diet, or adaptive responses
to the environment. E
