Examination of excretory products in the molluscs
indicates that more terrestial forms tend to be urico¬
telic and aquatic forms tend to be ammonotelic. This is
especially evident in Needham's classic study of the
littorinid snails where an ascending order of uric acid
production was found to be directly correlated with
increasing height in the intertidal zone (Needham, 1935).
als
In this regard, members of the genus Acmaea present an
interesting contiuum. On the Monterey Peninsula,
populations of the five common species of this genus
are found varying from +0.0 feet to +5.0 feet. To see if
any correlations could be found between intertidal zona¬
tion and nitrogen excretory patterns, a comparative
analysis of excretory products in this genus was made.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
The five species of Acmaea used in this investi¬
gation were Acmaea digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833; A, lima¬
tula Carpenter, 1844; A: scutum Eschscholtz, 1833; ap shs
823 and A. scabra (Gould, 1846). All species were collected
from the intertidal area at periods of low tide on
Pescadero Point in Monterey County, California.
The same collection procedure was followed for all
animals studied. Each animal was removed from the rock
