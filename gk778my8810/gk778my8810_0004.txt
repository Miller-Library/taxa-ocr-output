substratum, with care to avoid loss of fluid from the
mantle cavity, and placed into a capped glass vial
containing 5 ml of artificial sea water (Harvey, 1954).
The animals were kept in the vials at sea water tempera¬
ture for two to three hours. The artificial sea water
(ASW) was decanted into a graduated centrifuge tube, the
limpet removed, and each vial rinsed with 2 ml of ASW.
Each animal was then gently squeezed, anterior end down
over the centrifuge tube, to empty the mantle cavity of
any remaining fluid. The pooled fluid was brought to
10 ml with ASW, centrifuged to remove any particulate
matter, and the supernatant decanted and frozen until
used for analyses.
Total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and urea nitrogen
were assayed by the microdiffusion method of Ternberg (1965).
The total nitrogen was determined on a 1 ml sample after
wet ashing with 1 ml of sulfuric acid saturated with cop¬
per sulfate. Ashed samples were diluted with 5 ml of
distilled water, and 4 ml of 10 N sodium hydroxide were
substituted for the sodium carbonate solution used in
Ternberg's original method.
Urea was determined as ammonia after a thirty minute
incubation with 0.1 ml of a 50 mg/ml solution of urease
(obtained from Matheson, Colman, and Bell) in distilled
water. Uric acid was determined colorimetrically by the
method of Sobrinho-Simões (1965). Prior removal of
proteins was found to be unnecessary.
