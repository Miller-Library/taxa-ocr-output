clear. Qualitative tests with 0.25% ninhydrin solution
show the presence of peptides and amino acids in the
samples obtained from the limpets. This may account
for some of the 13-18% unidentified nitrogen.
SUMMARY
Nitrogen excretory products were examined in the
genus Acmaea by a microdiffusion technique for urea and'
ammonia and a colorimetric technique for uric acid.
Five species were examin√©d, varying in vertical distribution.
Similar concentrations of ammonia, urea, and uric acid
were found in all five species. A large amount of
intraspecific variation in the distribution of these
compounds was noted, especially in the high intertidal
forms Acmaea scabra and Acmaea digitalis. These variations
might reflect individual differences in enzyme activity,
individual differences in diet, or adaptive responses
to the environment.
