unique adaptation of the higher forms to secrete more
uric acid when dry than when wet. Such a transition
would be of adaptive value, since ammonia and urea at
high concentrations are toxic.
Although urea was found to be excreted by all species
examined, the metabolic mechanism of its formation is
not clear. Campbell (1966) found no arginase in the
spP
digestive gland of an Acmaea, suggesting the absence of
the ornithine cycle in this species. However, Campbell
only examined the digestive gland, leaving open the pos¬
sibility that the enzyme might be present in other tissues.
While his results possibly eliminate the ornithine cycle,
other pathways based upon purine degradation could be
alternative mechanisms for urea production. For example,
in fishes, products of purine breakdown from uric acid
give rise to urea via the enzyme allantoicase (Laskowski,
1951). This pathway is also suggested by hi
preliminary experiments indicating formation of urea by
minced digestive gland in an ASW- uric acid solution.
The finding that all three products are present,
and the reported absence of arginase, suggests the pos¬
sibility that the source of ammonia nitrogen is by
protein catabolism, whereas the urea and uric acid pro¬
ducts might result from purine catabolism.
The nature of the  nitrogen is not
