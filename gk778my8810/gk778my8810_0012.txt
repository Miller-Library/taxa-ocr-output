was reproducible. These maximal and minimal
components of variability, only seen in comparing indi¬
viduals, would be masked by methods that measure pooled

. In particular, these results demonstrate
the value of individual analysis. Although average
values can be obtained, as in Table 2, the interspecific
differences observed might therefore be misleading.
Several hypothses can be advanced to explain the
large individual variation in the relative amounts of
excretory nitrogen. One is that enzyme content varies
within the population, resulting in different distri¬
butions of excretory nitrogen products when comparing
individuals. This is especially suggested by William's
work on biochemical variation within individuals of
the same species (Williams, 1966). Another explanation
is that individual variations in the diet would result
in the observed distribution of nitrogen products. A
third possibility is that the limpet changes its major
products of nitrogen excretion as a result of exposure
to air during the tidal cycle. This is suggested by
Needham's (1935) proposal that more terrestial animals
tend to excrete uric acid, whereas more aquatic forms
tend to excrete ammonia. This hypothesis is also sugges¬
ted by the larger variations in the higher forms, which
would have been exposed to longer, and more variable,
periods of dryness. If correct, this could suggest a
