Gaseous excretion of ammonia was determined by pla¬
cing the intact animal into a dry diffusion apparatus
for 24 hours. Gaseous ammonia was collected by absorp¬
tion on alkaline filter paper, and analyzed for ammonia
by Ternberg's procedure.
The microdiffusion assay procedure was calibrated
with ammonium sulfate solutions of known concentrations
and found to be extremely reproducible (Figure 1) with
triplicate and duplicate determinations on the same sample
revealing small standard deviations (eg., Acmaea scutum
NH, - N, 7.0 + 0.25 ug).
RESULTS
Ammonia, urea, and uric acid were found to be ex¬
cretion products in all species of Acmaea investigated.
Some species showed wider individual varations in
amounts of certain excretory products than other species.
For example, the values for ammonia nitrogen in Acmaea
digitalis ranged from 0.4 to 25 ug N, whereas for Acmaea
scutum the range was much less, varying from 6 to 10 ug
N (Table 1). In terms of individual varation, the
greatest variability in ammonia nitrogen was found in A.
digitalis, followed by A. scabra, A. pelta, A. limatula,
and A. scutum. Variation in uric acid was greatest in
A. pelta, followed by A. scabra, A. limatula, A. scutum,
and A. digitalis.
