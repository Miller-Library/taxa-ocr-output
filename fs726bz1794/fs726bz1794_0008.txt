BEHAVIOR IN OTHER HABITATS
Limited observations were made on six M. muscosa located in a tide
pool adjacent to the main study site, and on two individuals located on
a cement substrate immediately above this pool. The six individuals in
the tide pool did not home or follow regular pathways, but rather
wandered throughout the pool. At dawn, they settled in sites out of
direct sunlight and there spent the day. Activity at low tide during the
night decreased in the pool but did not halt altogether as in the
chitons of the rocky habitat which were exposed to air during low tide.
The two chitons located on the cement substrate above the tide pool,
like the rocky habitat individuals, returned to specific homes after
foraging at night during the high tides. They, too, generally followed
specific pathways within limited home ranges. None of the eight chitons
was active during the day and all showed a tidal rhythm in some degree.
SUMMARY
1. The movements of eight Mopalia muscosa inhabiting the rocky intertidal
were followed during 14 days over a one month period (April 28-May30).
All were regularly covered and uncovered by the tides.
2. The animals moved about only at night when submerged or awash. They
were inactive during the day and when exposed by low tides at night.
3. Each animal occupied a spcific home site when inactive; home sites on
rocks near or in sand, or adjacent to sea anemones (Arthopleura spp.).
4. In foraging, individuals normally followed specific pathways leading no
more than 50 cm from the home site, and returned along the same path.
5. Diet consisted mainly of red algae; the animals appear to be relatively
unselective herbivores.
