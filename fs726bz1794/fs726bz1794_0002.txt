Activity Patterns of Mopalia muscosa
Page 2
INTRODUCTION
The study of animals in the field often reveals aspects of behavior
not discoverable from observations on captive animals. Behavioral
studies on intertidal organisms in the field are usually carried out
during periods of low tide. Observations at high tide are more difficult
to make, particularly at night, and animal behavior under these conditions
remains largly unexplored. A search of the literature revealed no
such work done on chitons.
This study, carried out on Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846), was
directed toward revealing its temporal and spatial patterns of activity.
Attention was also focused on inter- and intraspecific interactions
involved in habitat partitioning, and on the possible occurrence of
individual homesites and territories or home ranges. Homing ability
in some Polyplacophora has been noted previously (Crozier 1921; Thorne,
1967, 1968).
FIELD STUDY SITE AND METHODS
The present study was carried out during the Spring of 1974 on the
rocky shores of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. Mopalia muscosa
is common here, particularly in the mid tide zone. The site selected
was a surface 1.2 x 1.3 m on a sculptured granitic outcropping, occurring
between the +1.8 and +4.2 foot tide level on the eastern edge of the
point.Surf conditions at the site during high tide varied from a gentle
surge to breaking waves.
The macroalgae occurring in the study site were Gigartina papillata
