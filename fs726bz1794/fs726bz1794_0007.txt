usually had much macroalgae present; yet some locations were void of any
macroalgae. On several occasions, feeding on Gigartina papillata was
observed.
Quantitative studies of the diet of Mopalia muscosa were not under¬
taken, but the gut contents of 5 chitons from very similar habitats in
areas adjacent to the sutyd site were analyzed qualitatively. The guts
contained a wide variety of algal material along with small amounts of
animal matter and a lot of sand. Those algae that appeared most often were
identified (with the assistance of Dr. Isabella A. Abbott) as Gigartina spp.,
Cladophora sp., Endocladia muricata (Postels and Ruprecht) J. G. Agardh,
and Hildenbrandia occidentalis Setchell. Also included were Petrocelis
franciscana, (author), Chaetomorpha sp. and a variety of blue-green and
coralline algae. Boolootian (1964) also found M. muscosa to be a non¬
specific herbivore, feeding on what was available, along with small
amounts of animal matter he believed was accidentally ingested.
The home ranges of individual chitons, as determined by the paths
they followed, did not appear to overlap. Only on 2 out of the 63 chitons
journeys monitored did a chiton enter into another's home range. On one
of these occasions the resident individual left its home, approached the
intruder's girdle and remained there for about half an hour. The resident
chiton then left the intruder and traveled a wide semicircle of about a
50 cm radius in its home range before returning home again. The intruder
remained for a little over an hour before moving off to a new site.
Collisella pelta were absent from the study area but were abundant on
rocks in adjacent areas, indicating possible competitive exclusion. Connor
(1974) demonstrated that C. pelta exhibits an avoidance reaction to M. muscosa
pushing C. pelta when it encountered the limpet in its territory.
