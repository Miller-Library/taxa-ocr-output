Activity Patterns of Mopalia muscosa
6. A competitive herbivore, Collisella pelta, appeared to be excluded from
the home range of M. muscosa.
7. Animals observed in a tidepool showed similar basic activity patterns
but failed to home or completly halt movement during low tides at
night, as seen in those directly exposed to the tidal cycle.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
My thanks go to Christopher Harrold and Dr. Robin Burnett for their
assistance and advice, and Dr. Isabella A. Abbott and Bob Sellers for
help in algae identifications. Most of all I would like to extend my
sincere appreciation to Charles Baxter for his undying enthusiasm and
unlimited advise.
