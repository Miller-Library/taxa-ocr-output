chiton and blocked it. This individual settled about 7 cm away, and then
consistently homed to this new site for 5 observed journeys over the
following 15 days. The only other occasion a chiton failed to home occurred
when one individual traveled 20 cm beyond it customary range of 40 cm
from home. Instead of returning, it stayed at a site similar to its old
home, about 35 cm away, and subsequently was lost from the study area.
Foraging occurred only at night, when the chitons were submerged or
awash. Not all of the animals monitored moved every night: during the
14 nights of observation the total number of times a particular individual
left home varied from 4 to 14, with a mean of 9.
If the rock was submerged or awash by an incoming tide at the onset
of dusk, the animals moved away from their homes. If the study site was
dry, activity was delayed until the chitons were wetted by the incoming
tide. The chitons began the return journey to their homesites at such
a time that they were back at their homesites before sunrise or before
a receeding tide uncovered them, whichever came first. Thus no animal in
the study site was left either conspicuously exposed to avian predators
or stranded in a position where desiccation rates were high.
Similar activity patterns were found for Chiton tuberculatus Linne
by Crozier (1921) and for Acanthozostera gemmata (Blainville) by Thorne
(1967, 1968).
Figure 1 illustrates other intriguing variations in activity. More
individuals were active at spring tides (May 7, May 20 and May 21, 1974)
than at neap tides (April 29 and May 9, 1974). There was a period of
inactivity during high tide at night when the individuals were away from
home (May 3, May 7 and May 20, 1974). In addition, some individuals
remained out, but inactive, during the high low tides that occurred in
the middle of the night. (April 29 and May 9, 1974); these individuals were
