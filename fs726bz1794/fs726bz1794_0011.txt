Activity Patterns of Mopalia muscosa
S. Y. Smith
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Fig. 1: Date, time, light, tidal height, and movements of 8 M. muscosa
during ten 14 hr. periods of observation. Positions of animals
were recorded at intervals of 15 min. to 1 hr. throughout the
14 hours for these ten dates. Four additional nights these
chitons were observed only the observations were sporadic.
This additional data is included in an Appendex on file at Hopkins
Marine Station. Each vertical white bar above the axis indicates
the percentage of the total number of animals moving sometime
within that hour: the dark vertical bar shows the average
distance these animals moved during that hour. Below the line
the vertical white bar indicates the percentage of the total
number of animals away from their homes, which does not always
equal the percentage moving. Absence of bars means all animals
were examined and found to be immobile at their home sites.
Fig. 2: Rocky intertidal study area: (a) shows the position of home
sites (oval areas) and respctive home ranges with regularly
followed pathways, shown in broken lines, in the study area. Note
most of the home sites are in the sandy regions (heavily stippled
areas bearing diagonal lines). (b) is another view of section A,
both views are at approximately a 45Â° angle looking into the
study area.
