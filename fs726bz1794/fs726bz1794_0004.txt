unmarked, and natural landmarks were used as reference points to note the
Positions of animals. The chitons could, in this way, be observed with
minimal disturbance.
An initial 48-hour watch indicated that the Mopalia moved only at
night, therefore an intensive surveillance of the chitons was conducted
from just before dusk to shortly after dawn, with intermittent daytime
observations. The night time observations were made at intervals of
15 minutes to one hour. For each observation the chitons' new positions
and the distances traveled from their previously noted positions were
recorded. These night observations were made with a flashlight, using a
red filter to reduce disturbance during their dark cycle. Observations
on submerged animals were made with the use of a wet suit, face plate,
and snorkle.
DIURNAL AND TIDAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS
The data on movements are summarized in Fig. 1; original data are
on file in the library at Hopkins Marine Station.
During daylight hours and when exposed by the tide, Mopalia muscosa
were not active, and were in fairly protected locations. Six of the
eight sites were adjacent to a sandy bottom and in a depression, crevice,
or at the base of a rock. Individuals were often partially or completely
buried by the sand. Another daytime site was under or next to Anthopleura
elegantissima and Anthopleura xanthogrammica. After foraging, the eight
individuals in the rocky area homed for 69 out of the 71 excursions monitored.
Homing is degined here as the return to the exact site the individual left
aarlier that night. In one instance, a rock washed into the home of a foraging
