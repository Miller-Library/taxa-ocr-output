located at the lowest vertical positions in the study area and during these
low tides were never entirely uncovered. On one occasion an individual
was found away from its home during a low tide that left it totally
uncovered. That particular animal halted movement until the next inÂ¬
coming tide, whoih occurred while it was still dark.
These observations suggest that the chitons predict the time and
perhaps the height of low tides. Westersund (1974) found evidence of
endogenous tidal rhythms in his work with Mopalia muscosa, which could
explain the animals' ability to anticipate coming events. He also found
the extent of their activity reflected the magnitude of the tides. This
is corroborated by my field observations.
HOME RANGES, DIET, AND INTERACTIONS WITH NEIGHBORS
Fifty-three chiton journeys were coninually monitored while an
ont
additional 18 journeys were monitored sporadically (due to adverse weather
conditions). Figures 2a and 2b show the various pathways the individuals
followed. The distances traveled from the homesites ranged from 5 to 50 cm,
most being between 25 and 40 cm. Only on one occasion, already described,
did an individual move farther than 50 cm from his home.
Each Mopalia muscosa appeared to have a series of established pathways
within a radius of 50 cm from their homesites. These pathways were
followed fairly closely and consistently, though they did not always appear
to coincide with any obvious contours of the substrate. The same path,
was normally used on both the outgoing journey and the return home, though
this was not always the case. In general, a chiton left home, traveled to
a certain location within its home range, and remained there "until it was
time" to return home. The locations to which foraging chitons traveled
