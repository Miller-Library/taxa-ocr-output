Immediately adjacent to this area, the rocks were covered with Pelvetia
and here the relative abundance of Mopalia muscosa dropped. The resident
animals in the study area, in order of decreasing numbers of individuals,
included the annelid Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes, 1889), the anemone,
Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835), the snail Tegula funebralis
(Adams, 1854), hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.), the young limpets, Collisella
digitalis (Rathke, 1833) and Collisella scabra (Gould, 1846), the chitons
Mopalia muscosa and Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter, 1855), the anemone
nthopleura xanthogramiica (Brandt, 1835), the chiton Nuttallina californica
(Reeve, 1847), and the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes Randall, 1839.
Herbivores occurring on the adjacent rocks consisted primarily of
Cyanoplax and the lmipets Collisella pelta (Rathke, 1833) 1833, C. limatula
(Carpenter, 1864), and Notoacmea scutum (Rathke, 1833). None of these
latter limpet species occurred in the area where M. muscosa was studied.
Tegula were found in approximately equal densities in and adjacent to the
study site, whereas the numbers of C. digitalis and C. scabra declined in
the neighboring areas.
The activity of eight individuals of Mopalia muscosa in the study
site was monitored over a five-week period from April 28 to May 30, 1974.
Marking the chitons was unnecessary due to distinctive individual
differences in algal growth on their plates. The substrate was also
