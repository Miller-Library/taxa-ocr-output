Adults of the limpet Acmaea asmi (Middendorff, 1849)
live as commensals on the shells of the intertidal
gastropod Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854). The larvae,
however, pass through a pelagic phase; the longer they
remain pelagid the greater the chance they will be carried
away from the shore and hence away from the host population.
The densest adult populations of A. asmi occur in relatively
/12-7 Hdtd donel
high, and somewhat isolated pools, where neither wave
action nor surge will as easily carry larvae away from
T. funebralis (Eikenberry and Wickizer, 1964). Legie
suggests the possibittty oromparativelg beief o
swimming period and a tendency of the larvae to settle
ogresiblyy and
directly on the shells of T. funebralis, I therefore
attempted to follow larval development and to determine
if this were the case.
