at 6-7 days. These animals appeared to be shelless; yet
no shells were observed in any of the bowls. Perhaps
reabsorption of the shell occurs.
When an adult T. funebralis was placed with these larvae
a definite attraction towards it was noted, and several
larvae began to swim over the surface of the animal, appearing
to settle there. An opportunity to repeat the observations
was not available.
Summary
1. Eggs and sperm are shed into the water, and spawning
seems to be stimulated by exposure to light following
darkness.
2. The larvae develop rapidly; torsion begins between
30 and 35 hours and is completed by 55-60 hours.
3. A. asmi larvae appear to be attracted to T. funebralis
at 6-7 days and probably settle about this time.
