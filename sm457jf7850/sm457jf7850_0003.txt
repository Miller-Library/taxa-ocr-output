temperature (some at 10°6, some at 12°0, some at 14°0 )
and filtered sea water was changed daily, larvae began
to die at 48 hours.
Attempts were made to prolong life beyond two days
by providing food including filamentous diatoms ground
in a Waring blendor, diatoms from a high tide pool,
and pure cultures of both Platymonas and Stichococcus.

Although larvae were noted ta Stichococcus, the
food did not increase larval life span. Aeration of
the water likewise appeared to have no beneficial
affects.
The larvae began dying shortly after torsion. Between
45 and 60 hours the larval vel detached and the larvae
disintegrated. Ciliate protozoa were nearly always found
in the shells of these animals. The only larvae which lived
for as long as 6-7 days were those in three bowls raised
at 12°0, without a daily change of water.
