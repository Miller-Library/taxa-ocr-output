Fig. 2-6. Developmental stages. Fig. 2. Trochophore
larvae, 6-7 days after fertilization. Fig. 3. Pre-
torsional veliger, 28-30 hours after fertilization, from
dorsal side. Fig. 4. Pre-torsional veliger, 28-30 hours
after fertilization, from right side. Fig. 5. Veliger
with muscular phase of torsion completed, 48-50 hours after

All figures except number 6 were drawn from life. The
larvae shown in figures 2,3,4, and 5 were relaxed for one
hour in two parts sea water and one part distilled water
saturated with chlorobutanol. The larva in figure 6 was
fixed in osmic acid.
