Spawning of Adults and Rearing of Larvae
All larvae used for embryological work were obtained

by natural spawning in the laboratory during the period
from April 13 to May 24, 1963. A. asmi were removed
ga
from T. funebralis collected on rocks by-the Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. They were
placed in 5-inch finger bowls of filtered sea water,
changed daily, and kept at 14Â°0. A. asmi removed
from their hosts immediately began to clump together
and to climb up one another's shells. Eggs and sperm
are shed fee inthe water. The males generally spawn
first, although isolated females did spawn occasionally.
Various stimuli were tried to elicit spawning. The
most successful was light shock. Bowls containing several
A. asmi each were completely covered with inverted black
dishes at night so that light was excluded. Between
8 a.m. and 10 a.m. the following morning, the dishes
were removed and on eight occasions one or more animals
spawned immediately or within an hour. In uncovered
dishes exposed to normal diurnal light conditions animals
generally spawned at dawn if at all. Although light fol-
lowing a period of darkness appears to elicit spawning,
A. asmi will sometimes spawn without it, for twice A.
asmi spawned while in the dark.
