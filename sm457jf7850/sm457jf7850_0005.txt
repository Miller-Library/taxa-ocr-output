eye spots develop subapically.
Veliger larvae are free swimming throughout this
period, but become negatively phototactic at about 18
hours and tend to remain on the bottoms of bowls for brief
periods from this point on.
Phase IVâ€”Torsion and Post-Torsional Larvae. The
muscular phase of torsion begins between 30 and 35 hours
and is relatively rapid. Boutan (1899) states that in Acmaea
Viaginte
t the process takes only 2-3 minutes. The shell
and visceral hump rotate well over 90 degrees with
reference to the head and foot, allowing the animal to
retract its head partly into the mantle cavity. The
long apical flagella are lost at this time. The remaining
phase of torsion takes place gradually, but by 55-60 hours
torsion appears completed, and the head and velum can be
withdrawn completely into the shell. Other changes occurring
during late torsion or immediately thereafter include
enlargement of the foot and further development of the
operculum, development of additional muscles, thickening
of the mantle edge, and differentiation of the gut. The
larval shell at this stage is an unusual structure with two
small lateral flanges projecting medially from the lateral
margins of the shell just inside the aperture.
Metamorphosis and settling possibly occur between 6
and 7 days after fertilization. As stated, in a few
cases whole animals still with velum intact were observed
