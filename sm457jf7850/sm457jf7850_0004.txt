0.126-0.130 mm in diameter. A clear fertilization mem-
brane is formed. Cleavage follows the gastropod spiral
pattern. To the 4-cell stage, the blastomeres are equal;
at 8-cells micromeres are differentiated. Other details
observed conform generally to the findings of Boutan
Virgign
(1899) on Acmaea
Phase II—Trochophore. The prototroch, consisting
of a ring of large cells bearing a single girdle of
cilia actively rotates the larvae which at first
remain near the bottom. Shorter cilia cover the surface
anterior to the prototroch. The apical tuft bears two
long flagella measuring approximatelyO.12 mm in length
which appear to have a sensory function, as the larvae
back off whenever these touch a surface. Similar
structures were noted in Patella vulgata by F.G.W. Smith
(1935). The trochophore is very yolky, and no internal
organization could be seen.
Phase III—-Pre-torsional Veliger. Modifications at
this stage include the evagination of the shell gland,
development of the foot rudiment and expansion of the
velum. The apical tuft with its sensory flagella
remains. Longer cilia develop on the sides of the
velum. By 33 hours the velum has become a double row of
cells with two sets of cilia alternately placed. Two
