Energeties of Idothea resecata
The resulting powder was then pressed into pellets of approx-
imately 0.2 gram in weight. Caloric values were obtained from
runs in a Parr 1411 semi-micro calorimeter according to direc-
tions in Parr Manual f144 (table 1). Due to its high ash con-
tent, fecal material would not combust adequately on prelimi-
nary trials. Therefore, Nujol mineraloil (11026 cal./gm.)
was used as an additive (Paine 1971). Duplicate samples were
ashed in a muffle furnace at 500°C. for 5 hours in order to
convert dry weights and caloric values to ash-free equivalents.
Finally, average oxygen consumption of the isopods was
measured by the Warburg direct method of respirometry (Umbreit
1949). Each animal was covered with filtered sea water. Two
of the five vessels used were large enough to allow limited
movement by the animals. Eighteen animals were tested at 15°C.
Results
Data on consumption of the algae are listed in table 2.
Values for the total consumption by groups of animals were
obtained by difference between control and partially eaten
algal strips. A paired T-test performed on the algal strips
kept in the control box versus those dried immediately upon
cutting showed no significant difference in weights, supporting
the assumption that no appreciable growth was taking place
in the algae during tests. The same statistical test applied
to control strips and corresponding partially consumed strips
gave a significant difference (p.001). This indicated that
there was measurable grazing taking place. In calculating
