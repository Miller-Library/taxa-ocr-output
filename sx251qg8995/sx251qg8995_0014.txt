Fig. 1. Relationship between length (measured from mid-eye
to tip of telson) and dry weight of Idothea resecata.
Regression equation: Log I = -2.33 + O.39 X
Fig. 2. Relationship between wet and dry weights of I. resecata
Regression equation: Y = -5.03 + 0.22 X
Fig. 3. Relationship between body weight and oxygen consumption
per mg. per hour in I. resecata. indicates values in
which animal had the option to be active.
Regression equations:
Log Y = 0.86 - 0.62 X
Dry weight:
Log Y - 0.78 - 0.69 X
Wet weight:
energy flow in I. resecata.
