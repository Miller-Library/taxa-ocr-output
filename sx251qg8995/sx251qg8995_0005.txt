Energetics of Idothea resecata
Discussion
The assimilation efficiency of 0.71 obtained through
this study seems plausible when compared to the value of
0.66 found for the Macrocystis-fed isopod Tylos punctata
(Hayes 1969) and to that of 0.88 found for the omnivorous
isopod Cirolana harfordi (William Johnson, personal commu-
nication). However, the large variance found between the
sixteen test efficiencies suggests that experimental error
is too large to consider the results conclusive. As was
mentioned earlier, two procedures were used to collect fecal
material. This seems to be reflected in the data as boxes
1-6 showed strong evidence of high salt contamination and
have correspondingly low values for assimilation. On the
other hand, boxes 7-16 give extremely high values for assi-
milation, giving strength to the suspicion that fecal mate-
rial was lost in filtration. Another possible error might
be found in the caloric value used for fecal material.
Although the two calorimeter runs on this material gave
very similar values for its caloric content (1361 and 1420
cal/gm.AFDW), the use of an additive in such a determination
is considered a potential source of error (Paine 1971).
Hayes (1969) assumed that non-ash material in fecal pellets
would contain the same number of calories as Macrocystis
and calculated his values accordingly. Such an estimation
might be considered to give an extreme lower limit to assimi-
lation. In this study, an assimilation efficiency of 0.26
would constitute such a lower limit.
