Energetics of Idothea resecata
The relatively low caloric expenditure accounted for
by respiration in the energy budget defined in this study is
further evidence for suspecting a lower actual assimilation
efficiency for Idothea resecata. Although data from a few of
the respiration vessels in which the animals were able to move
somewhat might be indicative of a slightly higher active meta-
bolism (fig. 3), these values are only about 50% higher than
their regression values. Data available for swimming and
resting larvae of Mytilus edulis show that the energy require-
ment of a swimming animal is less than twice that of a resting
animal (Zeuthen 1970). Such an activity factor would do rela-
tively little to help balance the energy budget of this study.
Considering the error terms involved, it must be concluded
that the estimation of assimilation efficiency derived from
the data in this study is rather high. A value closer to
0.5 might be more realistic for Idothea resecata on the
basis of the possible experimental variables mentioned above.
Summary
An energeties study was carried out on the marine kelp
bed isopod Idothea resecata. An assimilation efficiency of
0.71 was found for animals living on a diet of Macrocystis
pyrifera.
