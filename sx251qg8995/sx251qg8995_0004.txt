Energetics of Idothea resecata
assimilation efficiencies for each of the boxes, caloric
equivalents for Macrocystis consumption and fecal production
were substituted into the equation
E - I
where E - assimilation efficiency, I = Ingestion, and
F - fecal production. Excretory waste of I. resecata has
been found to consist of gaseous ammonia and is thus negli-
gible in energetic considerations (Dresel and Moyle 1950).
When consumption and fecal production data are totalled for
the sixteen test runs an assimilation efficeincy of 0.71
can be calculated.
A regression line for oxygen consumption data is pre-
sented in figure 3. Calculation of total respiration for
the experiments was made of the basis of the mean length of
the isopods in each group. Because of greater statistical
significance in the wet weight - oxygen uptake regression
line than in the line for dry weight, lengths were converted
to wet weight estimates using data from figures 2 and 3. A
conversion factor of 4.82 cal./ml. 0, was applied to respi-
ration data. This is a reasonable figure when it is assumed
that I. resecata metabolize proteins and fat in addition to
carbohydrates (Dr. Frederick Fuhrman, personal communication).
Even if it were found that the animal metabolizes only carbo-
hydrates, the discrepency would be only 3.6%. Total energy
for respiration was found to be 371.9 calories. The total
energy values obtained in the experiments as well as values
reduced to calories per gram ash-free dry weight (AFDW) are
presented in figure 4.
