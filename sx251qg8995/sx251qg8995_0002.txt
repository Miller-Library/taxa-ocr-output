algae, strips of Macrocystis were cut in triplicate at the
same level from a single blade for each experimental container.
One strip was immediately labelled and dried in an oven at
80Â°C. The second strip was placed in a plastic container
with five male isopods of size range 2.5 to 3.0 centimeters
in length as measured from mid-eye to tip of telson. The
third strip was placed in a separate container to control
for weight changes in the algae independent of grazing.
Containers for the experiment consisted of 18x30 cm. plastic
boxes with plankton netting at eitherend to facilitate cir-
culation when suspended in an outdoor pond. At the end of
the specified time period, the animals were removed and
remeasured. Water remaining in the container was centri-
fuged for 20 minutes at 1500 rpm to collect fecal material.
A modified procedure was adopted beginning with test 47 in
which the water was partially drained through silk bolting
cloth. Another change in procedure at this time involved
resuspension of the fecal material in distilled water in order
to cut down on salt residue in drying.
Since lengths of animals were controlled during this
experiment, a length - dry weight standard curve was con-
structed (fig. 1). In addition, it later became necessary
to construct a blotted-wet weight - dry weight standard
curve in order to convert values obtained in respirometry
data (fig. 2). Regression lines were computed using a com-
puter program for regression (Sokal and Rohlf 1969).
Dried samples of algae, isopods, and fecal material
were ground to pass through a 60 mesh screen in a Wiley mill.
