Energetics of Idothea resecata
Introduction
Determination of an energy budget for any organism is
important in understanding its relationship to the environ-
ment. Most studies of this type have concentrated on ani-
mals of current nutritional importance to humans (Kleiber
1961). However, as research into food web relationships
deepens, more emphasis is being placed on the importance of
lower organisms in the system. Idothea resecata can be found
as a primary grazer on Macrocystis pyrifera, the common kelp
which is actively harvested by man for alginic acid. (Jones
1971). Thus it can be assumed that this isopod is able to
subsist chiefly on a diet of Macrocystis. For this reason,
I. resecata is an important animal on which to do an ener-
getics study.
In order to determine an energy budget for any animal,
several basic parameters must be characterized:
1. Ingestion
2. Excretion
3. Metabolic energy expenditure
4. Growth and reproduction
This study has attempted to find values for the first three
of these parameters for the isopod Idothea resecata.
Materials and Methods
Idothea resecata were collected from kelp beds to the
east of Hopkins Marine Station during the months of April
and May. Fresh algal blades were also collected at this
location. In order to avoid the errors involved in weighing
wet material and to eliminate variability between blades of
