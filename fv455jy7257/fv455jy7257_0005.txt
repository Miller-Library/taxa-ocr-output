Young Livoneca, up to three to four mm. would consume young dead
flatfish.
DISCUSSION
The gill chamber is a favorable place for Livoneca to live;
it is protected from predation unless its host is consumed, it is
provided with a good supply of oxygenated water, food particles,
and a convenient blood supply is available. It's characteristic
orientation could be keyed to catching small food particles that
pass through the gill. It would be advantageous for Livoneca not
to destroy this chamber by consuming it. Possibly the gill fila-
ments are destroyed to make more room for the growing isopod or as
a result of Livoneca raking them for food. Other damage to the fish
could be caused by the fact that large, ovigerous females occupy
most of the gill chamber, possibly obstructing the flow of water
through the gill, thus reducing oxygen uptake.
Results show that young isopods just hatched consume dead fish
until they are at least three to four mm. in length. However, males
larger than this and females will not eat the flesh, although they
may cling to it. Eventually, isopods deprived of a blood supply,
die. This implies that during their free-living stage, young
Livoneca can scavange for food while searching for a host. After
a certain life stage Livoneca must find a host or perish. Blood
sucking continues until the female enters the late brooding stage.
