It then ceases, although there is no change or degeneration of mouth
parts. Since t he hosts blood provides a steady diet, it would
not be necessary for Livoneca to gorge itself. This might explain
the empty gut.
It was not determined why blood is stored in the diverticula
and never in the gut. Possibly there are enzymes present in the
diverticula to digest the blood. It is also a convenient place
to store blood and use it a little at a time.
Livoneca has biting and sucking mouthparts which enable it to
draw blood. It bores through the tissue until it reaches a blood
supply; this could account for the small holes in the fish found
under the mouthparts when the isopod is removed.
SUMMARY
A study of the attachment of Livoneca vulgaris to its hosts,
Citharichthys sordidus and Platichthys stellatus, showed that
their characteristic orientation is with the head in the anterior
part of the gill chamber, pointed toward the anterior of the host
and its dorsal surface lies against the outer flap of the chamber.
A parasitized gill chamber may be missing gill filaments or have
an indentation on the inner side as a result of the female's
swollen brood pouch. Livoneca's diet is fish blood which it stores
in its diverticula.
