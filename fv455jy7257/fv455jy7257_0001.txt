INTRODUCTION
Several of the common ocean fishes off the California coast
are heavily infested with the isopod Livoneca vulgaris. Little is
known about Livoneca except that it is a protandrous hermaphrodite;
while young, it is a male with functional testes and as it matures.
certain tissue in the body developes into ovaries, while the testes
degenerate. It is distinquished morphologically from others of
the same genus, by the following characteristics: its eyes are sep-
arated by three times their width, the head terminates in a broad,
subtruncate lobe about twice the width of the eye, the telson is
twice as broad as it is long, the total body length is up to 32mm.
(Hatch,1947).
Most of the species of flatfish in Monterey Bay were infested
with Livoneca. This study is based on two of the flatfishes most
commonly caught, the Pacific sanddab, Citharichthys sordidus and
the starry flounder, Platichthys stellatus. These are both bottom
dwelling fish, which are born with one eye on each side of the head,
one of which migrates to the other side by the time they are  inch
in length. They are found from southern California to Arctic Alaska
(Miller, 1972). Their underside is white and smooth, their upper
side is rough and a brownish-green color.
The objectives of this investigation were to examine the diet
