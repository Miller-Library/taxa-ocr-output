sodium carbonate to a sample, heating to boiling, and centrifuging
for fifteen minutes at 200 rpm. The supernatant was poured off
and a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the
diverticula to further extract the pigments. Two mls. of water
was added and the contents centrifuged for another fifteen minutes
at 200 rpm. The supernatant was run on a Beckman DB-G spectro-
photometer to obtain wavelengths at which the hemochromogen absorbed.
The same extraction procedure was performed on samples of flat-
fish blood and spectra was taken to compare with the spectra of
the blood in the diverticula.
RESULT
Eighty two fish were examined and all but one were infested
with livoneca in both gills. Generally the size of the isopod in
the gill was proportional to the size of the fish, but there were
too many exceptions for this data to be statistically significant.
Usually one Livoneca per gill was found, but up to four isopods
were found in a gill. Since the two sides of the flatfish markedly
differ, isopods in the lower and upper gill were compared. The
dorsal side of the isopod matched the color of the side of the fish
it was on. No relationship was found between the number of isopods
or their sex and the side of the fish they occupied.
Female Livoneca were found with their heads in the anterior
part of the gill chamber, facing the anterior end of the host,
