and the nature of attachment of Livoneca to its hosts.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Flatfish were caught in Monterey Bay by pole-fishing and otter
trawling and kept alive in sea water tanks with constant running
sea water ataapproimately ,1%.
Isopods from dead
fish were kept in a separate aerated tank with constant flowing
sea water at 1400.
To study the position of the iso-
pod on the gill, infested fish were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
The gill flap was then cut away, exposing the isopod in place in
the gill chamber.
The gut and diverticula were removed from livoneca vulgaris
by dissection after they had been rendered motionless by immersion
in magnesium chloride. This prevented rapid emptying of gut and
diverticula. Examination of gut and diverticula contents took
place under 10X and 100X power.
The presence of blood in the diverticula was determined by the
Wilkinson and Peters Benzidine Peroxidase Reaction. Benzidine di
Hydrochloride was first added to the diverticula, then a few frops
of glacial acetic acid, and then a few drops of hydrogen peroxide.
The immediate appearance of a dark blue color indicated the presence
of hemoglobin.
Blood pigments were extracted from the diverticula by adding
