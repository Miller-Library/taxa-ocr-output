Species of the genus Acmaea are distributed throughout
the rocky intertidal zone of the California coast in associ¬
ation with a variety of animals potentially predaceous on
these limpets.
Predation on Acmaea by the fish, <span style='background-color:grey' title='Gibbonsia elegans : Fuzzy'>Gibonsia elegans</span> Hubbs
1929 was observed by Mitchell (1953). A continuation of
this work by Johnston (1953) indicated that <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Oligocottus snyderi : Exact'>Oligocottus

limpets in their gut. Frank (1965) has presented evidence
that <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Leptoplana : PartialExact'>Leptoplana may</span> be predaceous on some species of Acmaea
on the Oregon coast. The other major predator reported in
the literature is the starfish (Bullock, 1953; Feder, 1959).
Recorded here are observations of predation by the crab,
Pachygrapsus crassipes, Randall, 1839, a previously un-
recognized predator of these molluscs.

study: <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea scutum : Exact'>Acmaea scutum,</span> Eschscholtz, 1833; <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea digitalis : Exact'>Acmaea digitalis,</span>

These animals and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. crassipes</span> were collected between Mussel
Point and Cypress Point on the coast of Monterey County,
California, and studied both in the field and in the
laboratory.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Pachygrapsus crassipes was never observed attacking
Acmaea in the field. In the laboratory, when left undis-
turbed, the crab sometimes made as many as five attacks in
three hours. While all limpets were preyed upon, crabs
preferentially attacked Acmaea limatula.
Pachygrapsus crassipes had two methods of attacking
its prey. The first was simply to pry the limpet off the
rock with its cheliped. This method was successfully used
if the limpet did not have its shell clamped to the rock
surface and the crab could get underneath the edge.
Animals attacked in this manner showed a characteristic
chipping of the edge of the shell. This method was used
most often on Acmaea scutum and Acmaea digitalis. The
second method of attack was never directly observed.

However, the result of this method could be assessed by the
examination of shells. Shells of limpets subjected to this
form of attack had lost the peak of the shell above the
muscle scar (see Plate 1). A total of seventeen shells with
the tops removed were taken from the aquaria containing the
crabs. Such shells were never found in any other tanks.
Several shells were found that had deep scratch marks on
them that were possibly made by the crab's chelipeds exert¬
ing pressure on the shell. The scars were randomly oriented
on the shell and were found distributed over the entire sur-
face of the shell.
Attempts were made to mechanically duplicate the
possible squeezing action of the chelipeds by means of a
pair of needle-nose pliers suspended from a stand above the
limpet, so that only a lateral pressure was exerted between
the points. These experiments indicate that there is a
fracture zone or weak area that encircles the shell just
above the point of attachment of the shell muscles. This
zone seems to be present in all Acmaea species studied, but
it is most pronounced in the shells of Acmaea limatula where,
if a pressure of just two pounds was applied with the pliers.
the shell might break. The maximum pressure needed to break
an Acmaea limatula shell along the shear zone was seventeen
pounds at the tips of the pliers.

Studies on factors influencing the shell breakage
showed it is important to exert the pressure exactly on the
very narrow shear zone. The shells were most easily broken
if the tips of the pliers were placed on the longitudinal
axis rather than the lateral axis. When the pressure was
exerted below the shear zone, one Acmaea limatula shell
withstood a pressure of forty-five pounds. The same shell
broke when a pressure of twelve pounds was exerted at the
shear zone. If the shells were artificially broken in this
manner, they did not always produce a clean circular break.
The remaining shell fragments, however, could very easily
be broken back to the shear zone but no farther so that a
very even break could be achieved.
A second set of experiments were run in which a
cheliped that had recently been removed from a crab was
used to exert pressure on the shells in the same manner
that the pliers were used. The results of these experiments
indicated that the cheliped could puncture the shell at the
fracture zone as easily or more easily than the pliers
although no exact pressures were recorded. The cheliped
did not suffer any damage when the pressure was applied.
By having the crab squeeze a piece of balsa wood.
and then duplicating the damage with pliers with about the
same squeeze area, it was possible to make a very crude
determination of the pressure that could be exerted by the

crab. With this method, it was found that the pressures
exerted by the crab exceeded twenty-three pounds, which is
more than any pressure needed to artificially break a limpet
shell at the shear zone.
Surveys of the intertidal on Mussel Point indicate
that shells from which the peaks have been removed make up
about fourteen percent of the total Acmaea shells cast up
on the beach. Such shells were often not highly eroded and
the loss of the peak did not appear to be due to erosion
after the death of the limpet.
SUMMARY
The crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, has not previously
been recognized as an important predator of limpets. Labor¬
atory observations and experiments suggest that the crab çan
remove the tops of the shells of some limpets by squeezing
with the cheliped, thus making the viscera available for
food. The results of a survey of the shells cast up on
the beach, and the numbers of limpets apparently attacked
by this method in the laboratory, suggest that these animals
may be responsible for a significant mortality in limpet
populations.
