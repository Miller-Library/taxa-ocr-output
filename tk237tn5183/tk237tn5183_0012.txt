with a change of salinity in the absence of light, with gravity providing
the only directional cue.
5) At low oxygen tensions, the adaptive response should be to swim up;
normally this means toward the light and away from gravity. Accordingly,
with light from above the animals were positively phototactic and
negatively geotactic. However with light from below the animals swam
down, again positively phototactic, but in this case positively geotactic.
This result suggests light as the predominant cue for vertical moyement
at low oxygen concentrations.
6) At pH's other than normal (8.4) the animals shifted in the direction of
gravity, with little effect seen with a change in the direction of the
light source.
7) In all cases, upon release of the animals into the normal or nonstress
conditions tested, they shifted slightly downward with light from
above and markedly downward with light from below.
8) In conclusion, reproducible trends to move with or against gravity and
towards or away from a directional light source offered from above or
below are seen in response to a sudden change in environmental conditions,
suggesting the role of both light and gravity in governing directional
movement within a vertical column.
