Table 5 presents the data on changes in vertical distribution
with a sudden change in oxygen concentration with a
constant light source from below. The time of day
that each series of tests was carried out is listed
with the trial number. The number of animals counted
in each of the four segments (1-4) of the cylinder
at 0' and 2' is listed for each oxygen concentration
tested.
