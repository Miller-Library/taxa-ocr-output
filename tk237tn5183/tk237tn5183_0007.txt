light alone. Usually at high salinities the adaptively advantageous behavior
should be to swim upward, reflecting a negative taxis to gravity and a
positive taxis to light. With illumination from below, light and gravitational
cues are contradictory. Adaptively speaking the animals should have moved
upwards yet they are found on the bottom, so light must be exerting a
stronger directional effect than gravity. At low salinities, the adaptive
response should be to swim down; normally this means away from light and
toward gravity, but here again with light from below, the cues conflict. More
animals swam down than up, so perhaps the gravitational cue here is the more
important. However, the tendency to go down is much less clear cut here than
in experiments with light from above, so light may well play a modifying role.
At intermediate, nonstress salinities, the animals shifted consistently
downward with illumination from above and more strongly downward with
illumination from below. No adaptive advantage is postulated here and no
marked responses were expected. Perhaps with no salinity stress gravity
and light exert antagonistic effects on the animals with illumination above.
Thus, the animals might be found in either half of the column. Whereas, with
illumination from below, the two cues work together to yield the strong
downward shift. Perhaps crowding interferes with the animals' moyement
toward the bottom within the narrow tube, thus upon release into the whole
cylinder, the downward shift is made.
C. Responses to Changes in Salinity with No Light Source
In hopes of gaining further insight on the respective roles of light
and gravity as directional cues for copepod movements accompanying changes in
salinity, a trial was run in darkness. However, without the aid of an
infrared system to view the animals in the dark, light had to be introduced
to make the counts. Except for darkness, the experiments were conducted as
