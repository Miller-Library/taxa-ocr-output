marked short term changes in vertical distribution. Shorter exposure times
gave more variable results. For exposures greater than 5 minutes (depending
on the condition) the animals showed a grend toward random vertical distribution.
This system offers various advantages and disadvantages. It attempts
to mimic a possible realistic situation in which the animal swims into some
new local environment and experiences a change in some environmental parameter.
It allows manipulation of some parameter without confusing its effects with
those of turbulence or a change in light.
A dual control is provided by this test. First, for each tube, the
zero time count provides a normal environmental control contrasting with the
2 minute experimental value. Secondly, a normal control is included near the
middle of the test range, where no environmental change occurs upon the
animals' release from the inner tube.
III. Changes in Vertical Distribution with a Sudden Change in Salinity
under a Constant Directional Light Source
The salinities tested ranged from 1Oppt to 110ppt, approximately 1/3
to 3 times normal sea water. All salinity solutions except normal (34ppt)
were made up with Instant Ocean sea salts and tap water. The parts per
thousand of each solution was determined by an American Optical Co,
refractometer calibrated for salinity determinations. In the high salinity
tests the "normal" salinity water tended to rise to the surface. Occasionally
copepods entered this layer and stayed there. Therefore, after raising the inner
tube the top one milliliter was aspirated off the water column of the cylinder
to eliminate a less dense, normal salinity layer as an alternate environment
to the test condition of the rest of the cylinder. Removal of a possible
denser normal layer on the bottom of the low salinity tests was not possible
without introducing disruptive turbulence.
