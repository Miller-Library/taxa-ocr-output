before. However, after 30 minutes in the dark a light from below was turned
on (for less than a minute) just to check for any marked tendency for the
copepods in the central tubes to be in either upper or lower half of the
column. The animals were released and the light turned off. They were
checked again, after 2 minutes, with the same light from below. At low
salinities the animals were found on the bottom; at high salinities they
moved up to the top (Table 3). These results are in accordance with those
obtained with the light from above. In addition, the animals moved in the
adaptive direction, an important ability if the animals are to respond
correctly in the absence of light as in night.
IV. Changes in Vertical Distribution with a Sudden Change in Oxygen Concentration
under a Constant Directional Light Source
Oxygen concentration in these experiments ranged from 1.5ppm to off
scale 20"ppm. Low oxygen sea water was made by bubbling with nitrogen; high
oxygen water was made by bubbling with oxygen. Oxygen concentrations of the
test media were determined, following completion of the 2 minute count, with
an oxygen meter (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Inc. Model 54). The listed
values are probably reliable to +.5ppm. Each graduated cylinder was covered
with parafilm during the tests to minimize gaseous equilibration with the
atmosphere.
A. Responses to Changes in Oxygen Concentration with Constant Light from
Above.
The various trials show some consistent trends (Table 4, fig. 4):
1) At low oxygen concentrations (1.5ppm to 2.5ppm) with illumination from
above, the animals shifted strongly up towards the light resulting in
almost all of the animals in the top quarter of the column at the 2
minute count.
