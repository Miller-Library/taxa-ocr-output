Table I presents the data on changes in vertical distribution
with a sudden change in salinity with a constant light
source from above. The time of day that each series
of tests was carried out is listed with the trial
number. The number of animals counted in each of the
segments (1-4) of the cylinder at 0' and 2' is listed
for each salinity tested. The shaded areas indicate
cases in which animals escaped the inner tube prior to
the 0' and thus these data points were not included in
the composite tables.
