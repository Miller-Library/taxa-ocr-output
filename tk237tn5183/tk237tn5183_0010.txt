despite the adaptive advantage of going up upon encountering low oxygen
concentrations, the animals went down with light from below, suggesting light
as the predominating directional cue.
As in nonstress salinity changes, upon encountering intermediate and
high oxygen tensions, the animals shifted markedly downward with light
from below but only slightly dowward with light from above.
V. Changes in Vertical Distribution with a Sudden Change in pH under a
Constant Directional Light Source
pH values ranged from 4.5 to 10.5. Solutions were acidified with
IN HCl and made basic with IN NaOH. The precipitate formed upon addition of
base was removed by filtration through Whatman No. 1 paper. The pH was
determined using a Beckman pH meter.
A. Responses to Changes in pH with a Constant Light from Above
With light from above, the animals shifted toward the bottom at
the pH's differing from normal, 8.4 (Table 6, fig. 5). However, eyen the
pH test choices closest to the normal were rather extreme in view of very
slight pH fluctuation found in the field (Burnett 1977, pers. comm.). Also
Adaptive responses under stressing pH's may not have been selected for as
strongly as for other environmental stresses such as salinity or low oxygen
concentrations. Furthermore, there is no obvious direction (up or down) to
swim to effectively avoid stress-exerting pH conditions. At the altered pH's
tested the animals were positively geotactic and negatively phototactic with
light from above.
B. Responses to Changes in pH with a Constant Light from Below
With light from below, animals at all pH's shifted strongly dowward
(Table 7, fig. 5). If light were the predominating cue at altered pH's
