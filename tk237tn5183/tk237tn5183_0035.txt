Figure 5a presents a composite of 3 trials on changes in
vertical distribution with a change in pH with light
from above. Each horizontal bar within the outlined
shapes represents the percentage of the animals tested
that were found in each of the 4 segments (1-4) of
the cylinder at 0' (top) and 2' (bottom). Analogously,
igure 5b presents a composite of 2 trials with changes
in pH with light from below.
