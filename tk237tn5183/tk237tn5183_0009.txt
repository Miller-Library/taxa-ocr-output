2) Through the rest of the range, intermediate to high oxygen content,
only a slight downward shift occurred, with animals still distributed
throughout the water column.
Again, the responses appear to be adaptive. At low oxygen concentrations
the best direction to swim in search of higher dissolved oxygen is upward,
where greater gaseous exchange could occur at the surface. However, at high
oxygen concentrations, behavior does not differ from that exhibited in
normal conditions. It is unlikely that in nature dissolved oxygen levels
would get sufficiently high to be toxic or provide stress to the animals, and
therfore one would not expect the animals to show any marked response. These
copepods are routinely found in pools with high photosynthetic activity and
supersaturated waters (dissolved oxygen = 12ppm - 16ppm).
When introduced to low oxygen water the animals were positively
phototactic and negatively geotactic. Again, experiments with light from
above do not supply information on the respective roles of gravity and
light. In the next set of experiments light was offered from below.
B. Responses to Changes in Oxygen Concentration with Constant Light from
Below
With illumination from below, in tests at all oxygen tensions, the
animals showed a marked movement downward (Table 5, fig. 4). At the 2
minute count almost all animals were found within the bottom quarter of the
column (fig. 4). If gravity were the predominating cue at low oxygen levels
no change in distribution from experiments with light from above would be
expected, but this result was not obtained. If light were the predominating
cue at low oxygen tensions, the animals would be found at the bottom of the
column in these tests. The results fall in accordance with this model. Thus,
