I. Introduction
Investigations on planktonic copepods and other open water crustaceans
have shown that in some species phototaxis is affected by various environmental
conditions such as salinity (Loeb 1893, Rose 1925 in Waterman 1961), oxygen
tension (Herter 1927 in Waterman 1961), pH (Loeb 1906 in Waterman 1961),
temperature (Dice 1914, Loeb 1893, Rose 1925 in Waterman 1961) and turbulence
(Herter 1927 in Waterman 1961). Tigriopus californicus is an abundant
copepod found along the California coast in high splash pools. These pools
often remain out of communication with the open ocean for extended periods of
time, and undergo large fluctuations in salinity, oxygen and pH (Burnett 1977,
pers. comm.). In the face of these extreme conditions, the survival of the
animal may be enhanced by the ability to exhibit different responses under
different environmental conditions. This would include responses to such
stimuli as light and gravity. No previous work has been published on the
phototactic responses of Tigriopus californicus. Vertical movement is of
particular interest since most environmental parameters such as salinity,
oxygen, etc. exhibit vertical gradients in the habitat. This being the case,
vertical movement is more likely to bring about a change in local environment
than a horizontal one, and thus be the most adaptive short term strategy. In
the long term, habituation or acclimation may occur. The following study
examines short term upward and downward motion of Tigriopus californicus
associated with an abrupt change in salinity, oxygen tension or pH, under
a constant directional light source.
II. General Materials and Methods
The animals were collected from one high tidepool at Mussel Point,
Pacific Grove, CA. A suction bulb was used to obtain a sampling from all
portions of the water column, and the animals were strained through a nylon
