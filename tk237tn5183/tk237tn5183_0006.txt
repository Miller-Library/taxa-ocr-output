Â«how a positive phototaxis and negative geotaxis. At unusually low and
high salinities the physical properties of the medium itself would tend to
reinforce the above taxes; animals neutrally buoyant at a given salinity
would tend to sink down in the less dense water at lower salinities and
float upwards in the denser water at high salinities. Such physical response
may contribute slightly to the foregoing results, but does not explain
them as will be seen in the next experiments.
The experiments with light from above offer no clue as to what
environmental cues Tigriopus is using to distinguish up from down. One
approach to separating the effects of light and gravity is to experimentally
provide illumination from below instead of from above. If the response of
Tigriopus is made mainly on the basis of gravitational cues, the vertical
distribution of copepods should not change from that seen in the experiment
with light from aboye. If light provides the major directional cue, a
reciprocal distribution would be generated. If both cues are operating
strongly, some intermediate results would be expected.
B. Responses to Changes in Salinity with a Constant Light Source from Below
In all three triabperformed, the animals moyed toward the bottom of
the tube at all salinities, though the tendency is weakest at both high and
low salinity extremes (Table 2, fig. 2). A row-by-column contingency test
indicates that the distribution found at these extremes is significantly
different from the distribution at the intermediate salinities to a confidence
level of p.005. The results at the extremes immediately dispel any possibility
that buoyancy effects are a major factor, since eyen at the densest salinity
animals can be found on the bottom, and even at the lowest salinity animals
can be found at the top.
The results also cannot be explained by response to gravity or to
