Table 3 presents the data on changes in vertical distribution
with a sudden change in salinity with no light source.
Just prior to releasing the animals the light was
turned on just long enough to check for any marked
tendency to be in either upper or lower half of the
water column. No such distribution was noted. The
light was not left on long enough to take a count:
consequently, only the 2' counts were obtained.
