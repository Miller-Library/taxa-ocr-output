A. Responses to Changes in Salinity with a Constant Light Source from Above
The results of four separate trials are shown in Table 1. In all
trials, regardless of the time of day they were carried out, some consistent
trends are observed, justifying combining the data sets to yield a composite
picture of the response, shown numerically in Table 1, graphically in fig. 3.
The trends are as follows:
1) Counts taken before the animals were released into the test condition
show no marked tendency for the animals to be in either upper or lower
half of the column.
2) Upon encountering low salinities (lOppt - 25ppt) the animals tend strongly
downward, away from the light, resulting in most of the animals occupying
the bottom quarter of the column.
3) Upon encountering high salinities (80ppt - 110ppt) the animals tend
strongly upward, towards the light, resulting in most of the animals
grouped in the top quarter of the water column.
4) In the intermediate salinity range (34ppt - 60ppt) there is a small
shift downward.
This behavior seems quite adaptive. If it is advantageous for an
animal to avoid high or low extremes of salinity it should swim downward on
encountering lower salinities since the denser, higher salinities would be
found towards the bottom; conversely, upon encountering a higher salinities
an animal ought to swim upward, the most likely direction of a lower salinity.
In a tidepool in the field, two major stimuli provide cues as to the directions
up and down. Light always enters from above the horizon, ranging from near
horizontal to directly above. Gravity provides another cue as to the
directions up and down. In the above experiments, at low salinity, Tigriopus
show a negative phototaxis and a positive geotaxis. At high salinities they
