Figure 1 diagrams the physical aspects of the experimental
set-up. The 50ml graduated cylinder was placed
in a constant directional light offered from above
or below. Light intensities were measured with a
Li-Cor photometer (model LI-185) with the sensors
oriented facing the light source and parallel to
the axis of the graduated cylinder.
