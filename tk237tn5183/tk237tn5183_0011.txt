the animals would be found at the top with light from below. However, the
animals move to the bottom with light from below as they did under light
from above, the result predicted if gravity were the stronger cue. As in
salinity and oxygen experiments at normal conditions, the animals shifted
slightly downward with light from above and strongly downward with light
from below.
VI. Summary
1) The short term responses to sudden changes in salinity, oxygen
concentration, and pH, in terms of tendency to swim upward or downward,
were studied using a light coming either from above or below, to
investigate the role of light as a directional cue to vertical moyement.
2) At low salinities, the adaptive response should be to swim down; nommally
this means away from the light and toward gravity. Accordingly, with
light from above the animals were negatively phototactic and positively
geotactic. However, with light from below, most animals swam down
toward gravity and fewer animals were found at the top, away from light.
This result suggests gravity over light as the predominant directional
cue for vertical movement, with light playing a modifying role.
3) At high salinities, the adaptive response should be to swim up;
normally this means toward the light and away from gravity. Accordingly.
with light from above, the animals were positively phototactic and
negatively geotactic. However, with light from below, most animals swam
down toward the light, and fewer found on top away from gravity. This
result suggests light over gravity as the predominant directional cue
for vertical movement at high salinities, with gravity playing a
modifying role.
4) The animals are capable of responding in an adaptive manner when confront
