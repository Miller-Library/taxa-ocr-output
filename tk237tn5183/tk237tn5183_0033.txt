Figure 4a presents a composite of 3 trials on changes in
vertical distribution with a change in oxygen
concentration with light from above. Each horizontal
bar within the outlined shapes represents the
percentage of the animals tested found in each of the
4 segments (1-4) of the cylinder at 0' (top) and
2' (bottom). Analogously, figure 4b presents a
composite of 2 trials with changes in oxygen concentra
tion with light from below.
