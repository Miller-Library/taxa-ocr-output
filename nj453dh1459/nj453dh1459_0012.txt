Limpets on Pollicipes
The greater density of P-limpets on clusters near macroalgae
suggests a relationship of P-limpets to rock cover. Giesel (1969)
describes the transition of limpets 4.5 mm or larger to Pollicipes
clusters. A higher initial density of R-limpets on the rock, acting
as a source for P-limpets may explain the higher P-limpet density on
Pollicipes near algae. Direct observations that P-limpets remain
on clusters and do not leave to feed on rocks agree with most of
those of Giesel (1969). Over several months, he observed P-limpets
leaving the clusters only twice during cool and moist conditions.
The major food types for limpets grow on the surface of Pollicipes,
but are abundant only in the grooves between plates. Since limpets
were observed scraping the plates both in the field, and in the
laboratory, they possibly act as surface cleaners of Pollicipes plates.
The preference of P-limpets for Pollicipes and their greater
survival on Pollicipes during transplants and stress tests than that
of R-limpets suggests P-limpets are adapted for the life on Pollicipes
and benefit from it. Their low rate of survival off Pollicipes
suggests a strong dependence on the clusters. A study and comparison

of limpets on mussels, Mytilus californicus
may answer more clearly the questions about predation, density, feeding

range of Pollicipes, has a similar surface, yet offers a larger area
per individual Mytilus, and drastically differs in colors.
