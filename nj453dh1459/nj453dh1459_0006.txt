Limpets on Pollicipes

exposure and no protection from waves, on clusters of varying sizes in
the middle Pollicipes range. The 140 limpets were checked every six
hours for 72 hours for their presence on rocks.
Results
P-limpets tend to move on their clusters without leaving them.
A low percentage of limpets retain their orientation for a 24 hour
period. (Table 6)
On the average, P-limpets are not found more than two neighboring
Pollicipes away from the original after 24 hours. In two cases, two
limpets moved to the same Pollicipes, and remained there for more than
three days. (Figure 2 )
Feeding patterns
Methods
The gut contents of 60 P-limpets, 20 R-limpets and the surface of
20 Pollicipes was analysed for: Hildenbrandia sp., Ectocarpus sp.
blue green algae, red algae, fungi, Enteromorpha sp., and diatoms.
The rock surface was checked for Ectocarpus sp. within three feet
of the clusters.
