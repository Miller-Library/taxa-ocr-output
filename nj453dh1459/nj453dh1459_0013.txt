Limpets on Pollicipes
page 14
Summary
1. The density of individual limpets living on rocks within four
feet of Pollicipes clusters (R-limpets ) per surface of rock is
greater than that of the limpets living on Pollicipes (P-limpets)
per surface area of Pollicipes plates.
2. The morphology of P-limpets differs from that of R-limpets.
3. Many standard taxonomical descriptions of limpets do not
apply to P-limpets.
4. P-limpets move from an individual Pollicipes to the next,
but rarely leave the cluster.
5. P-limpets scrape food from the surface of Pollicipes.
6. P-limpets adjust better to new Pollicipes clusters and
R-limpets adjust better to new rocks.
7. P-limpets are attracted to clusters at a greater rate than
that of R-limpets.
8. P-limpets are better adopted to survive stresses on Pollicipes
than R-limpets, and R-limpets survive stresses better on rocks and
unnaturally arranged Pollicipes plates.
