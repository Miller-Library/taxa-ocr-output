Figure 1: Results of analysis of the radular ribbons of P-limpets
using techniques described by Fritchman (1960)
la: Plot showing divergence patterns of central plate
lb: Plot showing percentage of radulae with central plate overlap
Ic: Plot showing percentage of radulae with spatulum overlap
Id: Plot of radular length/width ratio
le: Plot showing percentage of radulae with shoulder
* Preliminary determination of possible species by qualitative
analysis of apex position and other features of shell
Figure 2: Results of limpet movement observation, showing percentage
of limpets that moved within given number of days over a given
number of individual Pollicipes.
Figure 3: Plot showing result of surface preference experiment
byrgiving the rate of increase and decrese of percentage of
P-limpets and R-limpets on:
a: Pollicipes clusters
b: rock
Figure 4: Results of the fresh water (seal efficiency) stress test,
given in percentage of limpets remaining and surviving the stress
over the given period of time and on the given surface.
