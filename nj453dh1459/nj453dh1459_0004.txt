Results
The bottom edges of a greater portion of the R-limpet shells are
curved, than those of P-limpets. The results are summarized in table 2.
A majority of black limpets with a white apex and an owl-shaped spot in
the apex have a curve. Interestingly, 80% of C. digitalis collected
from above the intertidal on rock surfaces are curved, and all have an
owl-shaped spot in the apex.
The mean length to heigth and length to width ratios of
P-limpets are significantly larger than those of the R-limpets. (Table 3)
The ratio of length posterior to apex to total length of P-limpets
showed the white, black and patterned P-limpets are three different
groups. (Table 4) Black shells with white apex are not statistically
different from the rest of patterned shells. 30 percent of all
limpets had a ratio greater than .84 (forward apex), indicating
they may be C. digitalis or A. strigatella, rather than C. pelta.
A low mean was observed for the black shells with a white apex and
lacking ribs. Twenty four percent of P-limpets showed signs of ribbing,
but only 128 had ribs visible on the inside of the shell. Five percent
showed signs of ribbing in combination with a curved dorsal surface and
a far-forward apex, ratio greater than.84.
