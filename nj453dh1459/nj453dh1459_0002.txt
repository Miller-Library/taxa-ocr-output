Limpets on Pollicipes
page 3
Distribution in field
Methods
The ratio of Pollicipes to limpets was determined by counting
limpets on 61 randomly selected barnacle clusters from the midportion
of their tidal range at Point Pinos. Cluster sizes ranged from three
individuals to 400 per cluster with 60% of the clusters having at least
50 Pollicipes. The density of limpets on rocks within four feet of
Pollicipes clusters (R-limpets) was determined by counting limpets
inside a surveying square (.04 m2). Fifty-six determinations were
made, taking note of the fraction of each square covered by clusters
or algae. The density of limpets on Pollicipes (P-limpets) was
determined by measuring the plate surface area available to limpets
on Pollicipes, during dissection of Pollicipes. Pollicipes were
estimated to double the surface area available to limpets.
Results
The lowest ratio of Pollicipes to limpets was 2.67. The largest
cluster without limpets was 400 Pollicipes. The mean ratio was
29.73 and the standard deviation was 34.085. No limpets were on 188
of the clusters. For density values see table 1.
