Limpets on Pollicipes
page 9
Results
P-limpets can adjust significantly better to new Pollicipes under
natural conditions than R-limpets. See table 8. Between 68 and 302
of R-limpets transplanted to each cluster were observed climbing onto
the surrounding rock, and moving upward. Only one R-limpet moved
downward on the rock.
Substrate Choice
Methods
A Pollicipes cluster attached to its granite rock and a separate
granite rock (both 30 cm diameter) were placed in an outdoor salt
water tank with 108 P-limpets and 108 R-limpets around their base.
Salt water spray kept the system moist and limpets were counted on
each surface the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 7th day.
Results
Ihe results are summarized in Figure 3. P-limpets showed a greater
preference for the Pollicipes cluster than R-limpets. Fourteen percent
of R-limpets and 82 of P-limpets did not choose either the cluster or
the rock, and remained at the bottom of the tank.
