surface were analysed for signs of life such as a soft, contracting
foot, a retracting head, and moving tentacles.
Results
The survival rates were greatest for P-limpets on Pollicipes and
for R-limpets on the rock. See figure 4. The tight seal of limpets
to surface is not released immediately upon death. The remaining
P-limpets were qualitatively judged more difficult to remove from
the cluster than the R-limpets. Early during the experiment up to
44% of P-limpets were observed climbing upon each other's backs,
forming stacks up to 6 limpets high, while on rocks. The corresponding
behavior was observed for only 3% of R-limpets.
Discussion
The taxonomy of P-limpets presents an interesting challenge.
Though it seems that approximately 9% are C. digitalis, 40% C. pelta,
and the remaining 51% a combination of A. strigatella and others,
enough discrepancies exist between various morphological features
to preyent clearcut identifications of individuals. The features of
many white shells, particularly the position of the apex, indicate
c. digitalis is the prevalent species on Pollicipes, but the same
limpets lack the inner shell patterns and radular ribbon structure of
C. digitalis found on rocks. The 100% lack of curvature of white shell
bottoms suggests a separate group of limpets, with similar genetic
