Limpets on Pollicipes
page 10
Dessication Resistance
Methods
P-limpets and R-limpets were allowed to acclimatize for two days
on a fresh surface of granite and on Pollicipes plates cleaned with
NaOH and attached with Epoxy Glue to a 35 x 15 cm board. The limpets were
dried under room temperature conditions for two days and subsequently
sprayed with equally strong streams of water to dislodge dead and
weakened limpets. The remaining limpets were counted.
Results
A greater percentage of R-limpets remained on both surfaces.
See table 19.
Low salinity resistance (seal efficiency)
Methods
After two days of acclimatization under moist, laboratory
conditions, 33 R-limpets and 34 P-limpets on a granite rock and
89 R-limpets and 122 P-limpets on a live Pollicipes cluster were
submerged in fresh water. The limpets were counted after three hours
and sprayed as above after 1I hours. The remaining limpets on each
