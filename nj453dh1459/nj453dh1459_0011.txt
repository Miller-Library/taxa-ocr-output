Limpets on Pollicipes

background. A close examination of the radular ribbons and shell color
patterns of P-limpets and those described by Fritchman, (1960) clearly
shows that standard morphological features are not enough for the
identification of P-limpets.
P-limpets have shell adaptations for living on the Pollicipes
plates. The identical color patterns of shells and Pollicipes,
especially noted in the upper part of the mid-tidal range serve well
as protection against preditors such as Oyestercatchers, (Giesel, 1969).
The narrower and higher profile of P-limpets than that of R-limpets,
indicates an adaptation for living on Pollicipes plates. A narrower
base may be of advantage during stress periods. A wide base would
overlap the edges of Pollicipes, and cause dessication. A narrow
base may further facilitate feeding from the surface of Pollicipes
since less surface is covered by the limpet's foot.
While individual P-limpets have adjusted to living on small
surfaces, they enjoy two to fourteen as much space as the corresponding
R-limpets. Pollicipes clusters act as protective living quarters,
absorbing the force of waves through flexibility, retaining moisture,
and providing shade. Without traveling more than 1 cm, a P-limpet
finds another Pollicipes, possibly covered with microalgae, in exactly
the same environmental conditions as the previous Pollicipes. The
crossing between two individual Pollicipes is dangerous, because the
limpet needs to extend its foot through space, and may account for
the recorded loss of limpets.
