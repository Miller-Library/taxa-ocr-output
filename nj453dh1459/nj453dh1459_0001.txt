Limpets on Pollicipes
page 2
Introduction
The limpets Collisella digitalis (Eschscholtz, 1833) Collisella
pelta (Eschscholtz, 1833) and Acmaea strigatella (Fritchman, 1960)
are common grazers of micro algae in the mid-tide region of the
exposed rocky intertidal of central California. Examination of
plates of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby, 1833)
living in this range reveals an environmentally different habitat for
morphologically altered forms of these and possibly other species
of limpets.
Though the relationship of limpets on Pollicipes has been
reported and described, (Giesel 1969) little is known about the taxonomy,
morphology and behavior of these limpets. The following paper discusses
the problems of taxonomy, and the difference in morphology and behavior
of the limpets on Pollicipes, and those found on adjacent rocks.
All collection and field work was done during the Spring of
1980 at Point Pinos and at the Hopkins Marine Station. (Collections
excluded Collisella scabra (Eschscholtz, 1833) and limpets smaller
than 4 mm in length.)
