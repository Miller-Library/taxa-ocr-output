Limpets on Pollicipes
page 17
Table Legend
Table 1: Density values for limpets and the ratios of Pollicipes
to limpets on various surfaces at Point Pinos, in the intertidal.
Table 2: Curvature of limpet shell bottoms measured on flat surface
using light and a dissecting pin (.25 mm diameter).
No curve: no more light passes between the shell and the flat
surface in the center of shell, than towards the anterior and
posterior ends
Slight curve: more light passes through center
Large curve: dissecting pin fits between center of shell bottom
and flat surface.
Table 3: Mean and standard deviation values for limpet shell length
to heigth and length to width ratios. Values are significant
for p «.001 (Student's T-test).
Table 4: Mean and standard deviation values for ratios of distance
posterior end to apex over total P-limpet shell length. Pairwise
combinations of groups I, II, and III determined statistically
significant for p «.001 (Student's T-test)
