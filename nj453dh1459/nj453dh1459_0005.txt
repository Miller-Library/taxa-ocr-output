Limpets on Pollicipes
page 6
The typical color patterns described by Giesel (1969) for
C. digitalis were poorly represented in the P-limpets, while C. pelta
and A. strigatella features were prevalent. (Table 5)
A preliminary qualitative analysis of the apex position of 79
P-limpets indicated 68 possible C. digitalis and 11 possible C. pelta.
Of these, a high percentage of radulae had a high radular length to
width ratio and a low percentage of radulae without a shoulder.
A high percentage of radular central plates of limpets whose apex
was subcentral had central plate overlap. The central plate divergence
accounted for 538 of all P-limpets. (Figure 1)

Methods
The positions of P-limpets were marked in the middle intertidal
zone on clusters larger than 70 Pollicipes with fingernail polish and
noted again the 2nd, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 13th day. Not all clusters
were checked each day, due to adverse weather conditions. The resulting
limpet sample sizes were 67, 18, 9, 18, and 8 respectively.
A total of 60 P-limpets were painted with fingernail polish on
seven clusters no smaller than 70 Pollicipes, in exposed and protected
areas. Eighty P-limpets were painted on a vertical wall with western
