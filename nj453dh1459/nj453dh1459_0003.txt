Limpets on Pollicipes
Areas with macroalgae are more densely populated by both the
P-limpets and the R-limpets. The density of P-limpets per Pollicipes
is less than that of R-limpets on rocks. A qualitative analysis of
the mass ratio shows it is smaller than that of the ratio of
individuals.
Morphology of P-limpets vs. R-limpets
Methods
Morphological traits of P-limpets and R-limpets were scored:
A. Color: "white", "black", and "patterned" if two or more
colors were present
B. Curvature of bottom of shell: "flat" if no more light
passed between the middle of the shell and a flat surface than any
other part of the shell bottom, "slight curve" if more light passed
through the middle, "large curve" if a .25 mm dissecting pin fit
between the shell and the surface.
C. Ribbing: "suggested" if seen only on outer surface and
"ribbed" if seen from underneath
D. Length, height, width, distance posterior end to apex:
measured using a micrometer and expressed in ratios.
E. Radular ribbons: Microscope observations using the
methods of Giesel (1969)
