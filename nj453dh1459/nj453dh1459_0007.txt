Limpets on Pollicipes
page 8
Results
Two of the 140 P-limpets observed left the Pollicipes clusters
within 72 hours. One did not return to the clusters within the period,
and the other dissapeared. No other marked limpets were seen on
the rock surface.
The results of gut contents analysed are summarized in table /.
Red algae was not observed on Pollicipes plates, and Ectocarpus was
not seen in the scrapings of the rock surface. Red algae and
Ectocarpus were found in both the guts of the P-limpets and the
R-limpets. P-limpets and R-limpets both eat all the food types
surveyed.
Transplants
Methods
Painted R-limpets and P-limpets were transplanted to Pollicipes
clusters of size 50 Pollicipes or more. The limpets remaining on each
cluster were counted one day later, and an area of ! m radius was checked
for marked limpets. Where controls were used, equal numbers ofdtested
and control limpets were transplanted.
