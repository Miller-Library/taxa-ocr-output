MATERIALS & METHODS
Thermal Denaturation of MDH
MDH samples were prepared from cytoplasmic and mitochondrial porcine heart MDH
available commercially from Sigma Chemical Company. To remove the suspending agent,
ammonium sulfate, the MDH was concentrated in a centricon at 700 g using 20 mM
’C. Samples to be denatured contained 70-75 mM
imidazole chloride buffer (pH 7.0 at 2
imidazole chloride (pH 7.0 at 22°C), varying concentrations of BSA, and MDH diluted
approximately 1000 fold from the original commercial sample. Samples were heated in a
thermal cycler for the appropriate time interval. They were kept on ice for at least five
minutes, and then centrifuged at 15,800 g for 5 minutes to remove aggregated protein.
Triplicate enzyme activity assays were performed on the supernatant.
Assay of Enzyme Activity
MDH or LDH activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm,
the absorbance maximum of NADH, per unit time, using a Shimadzu Bio-Spec 1601 UV¬
Vis Spectrophotometer. The MDH assay medium contained 80 mM imidazole chloride (pH
7.0 at 22°C), 120 uM NADH, and 200 pM oxaloacetic acid. The LDH assay medium
contained 80 mM imidazole chloride (pH 7.0 at 22°C), 150 M NADH, and 2 mM
pyruvate. The reaction temperature was maintained at 20°C.
Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE)
To determine if there was more than one source of MDH activity in the cMDH solutions, a
native PAGE assay was performed. This assay separates proteins by charge and size, and
uses a stain to detect MDH activity. The procedure from Brewer (1970) was followed.
