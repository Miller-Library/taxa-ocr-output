RESULTS
Thermostability measurements indicated that porcine mMDH stability was enhanced in the
presence of BSA, with successive increases in the half-life of mMDH at 42°C with each
increase in BSA concentration (Figs. 1, 2,3). The decay curve of mMDH was exponential
(Fig. 2). CMDH at 42° was more stable than mMDH at 42° (Fig. 3). CMDH did not follow
an exponential decay curve as well as mMDH (Figs. 4, 5), and its stability was not
significantly enhanced by high BSA concentrations (Figs. 4, 5). When a native PAGE
assay was performed, a small secondary band was seen in the cMDH sample. This band
disappeared upon heat denaturation of the cMDH sample.
High BSA concentrations produced reductions in the catalytic activity of porcine mMDH
(Fig. 6). Glycerol and PEG-8000 solutions of increasing concentration produced
progressively greater reductions in the catalytic activity of AA-LDH (Figs. 7, 8). P.
charcoti AA-LDH was affected less by high glycerol concentrations than rabbit or G.
mirabilis AA-LDH (Fig. 7). PEG-8000 solutions had higher viscosities than glycerol
solutions at the same concentration (Fig. 9). 20% glycerol solutions produced reductions
in both Vmax and KmPVT of A4-LDH of all three species (Tables 1,2). 3.5% PEG-8000
solutions, which have about the same viscosity as 20% glycerol solutions, produced
smaller reductions in Vmax and KmPYf (Tables 1,2) Temperature reduction from 20°C to
10°C produced reductions in both Vmax and KmPYT (Tables 1, 2).
DISCUSSION
Enhancement of mMDH stability in progressively higher protein concentrations is
consistent with developed models of molecular crowding (Garner & Burg, 1994). High
concentrations of BSA favor more compact protein structures, which may be less prone to
denaturation. This study suggests that these effects can be very large, judging by the
