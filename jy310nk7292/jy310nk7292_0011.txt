If one assumes that glycerolâ€™s effect on AA-LDH kinetics is primarily due to viscosity, it
follows that some of the Q1O effect is due to viscosity per se. 20% glycerol solutions
lowered the Vmax of A4-LDH significantly (Table 1). Viscosity effects on enzymes
deserve much more investigation.
Conditions that resulted in lower Vmax's produced a concomitant decrease in apparent Km
(Tables 1,2). This may be due to stabilization of the binding-competent state of the
enzyme (Somero, pers. comm.). When an enzyme is slowed down, it samples fewer
configurations, and may be more likely to exist in a state in which substrate is bound. This
results in higher affinity for substrate, i.e., a lower Km. This is speculative, however.
Laurent (1971) has already shown that polymers reduce apparent Km's by reducing water
activity, thus explaining the Km decreases seen with PEG-8000.
Thermodynamics can often make good predictions of how enzymes will be affected by
different media (Garner & Burg, 1994). However, it cannot readily predict differences
between homologues of an enzyme. In addition, the Michaelis-Menten model may be an
inadequate model of how enzymes actually work (Somero, pers. comm.). More work is
needed in this area
Simplified models tend to belie the complexity of what is actually happening in vivo.
Studying biochemical systems isolated from their surrounding is like studying an organism
taken from its natural habitat. Although this may be helpful in understanding many aspects
of the organism, this type of work cannot adequately describe how the organism will
behave in its natural environment. An ecological approach to biochemistry, in which
cellular components are studied in conditions which more closely represent their natural
environment, should provide many more insights.
