Fig. 1. Activity of porcine mMDH after denaturation at 42°C in 6 different concentrations
of BSA. Error bars are standard deviations from the mean, n =3 for each point.
Fig. 2. Activity of porcine mMDH after denaturation at 42°C in 6 different concentrations
of BSA. y-axis is logarithmic to show exponential decay pattern. Error bars are standard
deviations from the mean, n=3 for each point.
Fig. 3. Half-lives of MDH in media containing different concentrations of BSA. Error
bars are standard errors.
Fig. 4. Activity of porcine cMDH after denaturation at 42°C in 2 different concentrations of
BSA. Error bars are standard deviations from the mean, n-3 for each point.
ig. 5. Activity of porcine cMDH after denaturation at 48°C in 3 different concentrations o
BSA. Error bars are standard deviations from the mean, n =3 for each point.
Fig. 6. Activity of porcine mMDH at 20° in media containing different concentrations of
BSA. Error bars are standard deviations from the mean, n-3 for each point.
Fig. 7. A4-LDH activity at 20° as a function of glycerol concentration for three different
species. Error bars are standard deviations from the mean, n =3 for each point.
Fig. 8. A4-LDH activity at 20° as a function of PEG-8000 concentration for two species.
Error bars are standard deviations from the mean, n- 3 for each point.
