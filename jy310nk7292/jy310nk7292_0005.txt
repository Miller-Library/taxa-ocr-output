Viscosity, which increases significantly with decreases in temperature, has been shown to
be an important variable in physiology. 40% of the reduction in swimming speed and 55%
of the reduction in water movement of the larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus
with a decrease in temperature were found to be due to the increased viscosity of the cooler
medium, rather than temperature per se (Podolsky and Emlet, 1993). At the biochemical
level, Beece et al. (1980) state that "viscosity may play an essential role in determining the
state of the protein through structural fluctuations." High viscosity inhibits the ability of
proteins to move through a variety of substates (Beece et al., 1980). Surprisingly, the free
water of the cell possesses a viscosity only 1.2-1.4 times that of pure water at the same
temperature (Fushimi and Verkman, 1991). Much of the Q10 effect of temperature on
enzymatic activity may be explainable by viscosity, just as it explained some of the effect
on Dendraster excentricus. This question was investigated in this study. In addition,
crowding and viscosity effects on the LDH of different species were compared.
LDH from Gillichthys mirabilis(the long-jawed mudsucker), Parachaenichthyscharcoti (an
Antarctic fish), and rabbit, was used in this experiment. The AA isoform, which is found
in muscle rather than heart, and favors the conversion of pyruvate and NADH to lactate and
NAD“, was used. G. mirabilis is a eurythermal fish and lives in temperate waters. P.
charcoti lives near the freezing point in Antarctic waters, and rabbits maintain body
temperature at around 40°C. Since the viscosity of water varies from 1.8 cp. at 0°C to 0.65
cp. at 40°C, it would not be surprising to see some adaptation to viscosity found in the
LDH of these species. This was examined in this experiment by gathering A4-LDH kinetic
data in viscous conditions.
