ABSTRACT
Biochemistry is usually carried out under in vitro conditions that do not closely
approximate those found in vivo. Molecular crowding, resulting from high intracellular
protein concentrations, has been shown to affect macromolecular function (Garner & Burg,
1994). To study this effect, the thermal stabilities of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic
isoforms of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle, were
studied under simulated in vivo conditions of high protein concentration. The
mitochondrion contains much higher protein concentrations than those found in the
cytoplasm; protein crystals have been used to model the mitochondrial matrix (Srere,
1981). The mitochondrial isoform of MDH (mMDH) showed substantial stability
enhancement in media crowded with bovine serum albumin, a model protein. The
cytoplasmic isoform (cMDH), which is more thermally stable than the mitochondrial
isoform, exhibited no si gnificant enhancement of stability in crowded media. This
difference can be seen as an adaptation to local protein concentration. mMDH must be
more flexible to function well in a more crowded medium, rendering it less thermally stable
and more responsive to the stabilizing effects of a crowding agent. In order to study
enzyme function, which is closely related to stability, apparent Michaelis-Menten constants
(Km's) and Vmax's were determined in crowded and viscous conditions for the LDH of
three species. The LDH of Parachaenichthyscharcoti , an Antarctic fish, appears less
susceptible to the effects of agents that slow enzyme function than two homologous
enzymes from organisms that maintain a warmer body temperature. LDH from colder
temperature organisms appears to be more flexible than LDH from organisms adapted to
warm temperatures (Fields and Somero, in prep). This flexibility may explain the results
obtained.
