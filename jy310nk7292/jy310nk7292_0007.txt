Determination of MDH Half-lives
The log of MDH residual activity was plotted against time, and the best fit line was
obtained using Kaleidagraph software. Because cMDH did not closely follow an
exponential decay curve, the initial activity measurements (activity before denaturation)
were not used in the calculation of cMDH half-lives. These points deviated most strongly
from the exponential decay curve established by the other points.
Km and Vmax calculation
A4-LDH KmPYf and Vmax values were determined using an assay medium containing 80
mM imidazole chloride (pH 7.0 at 22°C), 150 uM NADH, and different concentrations of
pyruvate (0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and sometimes 0.8 mM). The
medium also contained the appropriate concentration of glycerol or PEG-8000 if these were
necessary for the assay. Triplicate assays were performed for each pyruvate concentration.
KmPVT and Vmax were calculated using the method of Wilkinson (1961) and Wilman
software (Brooks and Suelter, 1986). Those points that deviated from the calculated
regression line by more than two standard deviations were eliminated. Each calculated
Vmax was correlated to others determined on different days by measuring LDH activity
under saturation conditions: a medium containing 150 uM NADH, 2 mM pyruvate, and 80
mM imidazole chloride (pH 7.0 at 22°C).
Viscosity Measurements
Viscosities of PEG-8000 and glycerol solutions were determined by using a Gilmont
Instruments Falling-Ball Viscometer.
