low affinitu forms and floats in the membrane of the cell, showing
preference for one integral membrane protein or the other depending on
the receptor's state.
These models deal only with the earliest parts of the signal. It
seems likelu that the external signal is transduced into an enzymatic
process. The muscarinic signal mag utilize cyclic quanine phosphate
products to either inhibit cAMP production or stimulate a specific
enzume. DAG, one of the products of Phl turnover, effects change
through protein kinase C, allowing for phosphorglation of various
enzumes, and switching them to an active state. Ca effects usuallg
occur through some sort of Ca* binding protein, like calmodulin. No
one has conclusively proven how the external signal elicits an
ultrastructural change in the iridosomal platelets. Hicrotubule and
microfilament mechaniems have been proposed, but further
experimentation is needed.
In conclusion, muscarinic receptors are involved in the
iridescence of iridocytes, and they appear to act through the cycle of Phl
turnover, rise in internal Ca' levels, and by hindering the synthesis of
CAMP.
would like to thank Stuart Thompson for his support and
quidance, Anthonu Morielli for his time and drugs in the characterization
of the receptor, Chris Patton for his technical expertise, Bruce Hopkins
for providing all the squid I could possibly kill, and mang hearty thanks
to Roger Hanlon for his helpful advice and the use of his unpublished data.
Lastlu, I would like to thank the entire class of Sio 175H for one helluva
good time.
