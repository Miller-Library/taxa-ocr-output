fluxes in some sustems (Parod et al, 1980). After bathing the iridophore
in zero Ca' sea water for 50 minutes, addition of ACh produced no
change in iridescence. The prep was then washed with regular artificial
ses water, and subsequent addition of the agonist resulted in a
significant increase in iridescence. This procedure was repeated on a
different preparation and the results were similar, with slightlg less
iridescence after washing and application of ALh.
Effect of Forskolin, Caffeine
Muscarinic receptor mechanisms, in some cases, have been
shown to act by decreasing the sunthesis of cAMP (Birdsall et al, 1980).
Forskolin (.1 mt1) and caffeine were added to a bath containing a
semi-iridescent preparation. After 5 minutes, iridescence decreased
dramaticallu. After 30 minutes, iridescence came back slightly but was
still far from the original level. Addition of carbamylcholine to the bath
at this stage resulted in a sharp increase in iridescence. This procedure
wos repeated twice on different preparations, a fully iridescent
preparation and another semi-iridescent preparation, each time
resulting in a virtually complete loss of iridescence, that was reversed
bu application ofImM carbamglcholine.
DISCUSSION
The iridescence of iridocutes seems to be controlled by a
muscarinic-tupe receptor system that involves Phi turnover, a rise in
intracellular Ca' levels, and a decrease in cAMP levels. The responses
to a number of muscarinic agonists and the block of the response by
Specific muscarinic antagonists indicates that a muscarinic receptor is
involved. Muscarinic receptors have been proposed to exist in two
