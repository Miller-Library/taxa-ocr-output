and maintained in round holding tanks 2 m in diameter. Photographs were
taken with Kodschrome 400 and Ektachrome 400 using an Olympus UM¬
Camera mounted to an Olumpus upright microscope. The 10k occular lens
was combined with either a 40x water immersion Zeiss lens, or a lox
American Optical lens, making overall viewing magnification either
400x or 100x. Fiber optic incident lighting was used as the single light
source.
Skin preparations were obtained by excising patches of the
iridophore dermal lauer from the dorsal mantle region and pinning them
in a 3 mm diemeter, Sulgard coated dish. The dish was filled with
artificial ses water (500 mM Nacl, 12 mMMgi, 10 mac, 10 m
KCI, 10 mM HEFES, and enough KOH to bring the pH to 7.8). The
sppropriate drugs were diluted in saline and spplied bu exchanging the
solution in the beth. The zero Ca solution was prepared by substituting
Ng for Ca and adding 2 mM EGTA.
Preparations were placed under the microscope, and a single
iridophore donut was observed. A baseline level of iridescence was
obtained bu adjusting the light to produce a maximum amount of
iridescence (incident light made an angle of approximately 30° with the
horizontal). A photograph was then taken to objectively evaluate this
level of iridescence. Iridescence was judged by three factors: 1) Area:
the number of cells that were iridescent in the donut vs those that were
not, 2) Intensity: intensity of iridescence, and 3) Color: the color of
the light seems to be related to the strength of the response. White
corresponds to completely off, Blues and Greens represent a
semi-iridescent stage, and Reds, Golds, and Oranges indicate a more
fullu iridescent form of the iridophore. The various drugs were added
topicallu to the bath, and changes in levels of iridescence were noted.
