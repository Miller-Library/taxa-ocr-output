Photographs were taken at times of 1, 5, and 10 minutes after addition
of each chemical. Photographs were taken at later times depending on
the response to the drug.
RESULTS
Characterization of the Receptor
Various cholinergic agonists and antagonists were tested at a
final concentration of .1 mM. Agonists were judged to induce iridescence
if application to the bath resulted in an increase in iridescence. Theg
were judged ineffective if addition to the bath caused no change, and
subsequent washing followed by application of ACh resulted in a positive
change in iridescence. Antagonists were considered ineffective if the
combined application of the antagonist and ACh resulted in a change in
iridescence that could not be enhanced by subsequent washing and
application of ACh alone. The antagonists were judged to be successful
blockers if iridescence could be enhanced by washing and addition of ACh.
See Table 1
Cholinergic receptors can be divided into two tupes: muscarinig
and niocotinic. The non-specific cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine
uielded a positive result, as would be expected in either a muscarinic or
nicotinic system. Specific muscarinic agonists, ABMC, CBME, and
oxotremorine, gave positive responses to varging degrees. Host of the
specific muscarinic antagonists that were tested, atropine,
scopolamine, and pirenzipine effectively competed with the agonist and
hindered iridescence. From these results, it appears that a muscarinic
system is present in the iridocytes of Loligo.
Muscarinic agonists have been divided into two groups depending
on their effect on Phl turnover (Fisher et al, 1983). Group A agonists
