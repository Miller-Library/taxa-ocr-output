EIGURE LEGEND
Eigure 1: Single link model. Single receptor linked to
Phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation indirectly decreases cAMP
levels.
Eigure 2: Dual receptor model. Two receptors, each linked to
either Phosholipase Cor the G, inhibitorg protein.
Eigure 3: Double link model. Single receptor directlg linked to
both Phosholipase C and the G; inhibitorg protein.
Eigure 4: Floating receptor model. Single receptor links to
either Fhosholipase C or the G, inhibitorg protein, depending on the
receptors conformational state.
Plate 1: Lateral view of an iridophore donut in the off position.
Some Blues and Greens are visible.
Plate 2: 30 seconds after addition of carbarnglcholine. The donut
shows semi-iridescence. More Blues and Greens are visible.
Elate 3: Five minutes after addition of carbamglcholine. The
donut now shows a ruch greater degree of iridescence. Many more
iridocutes are on, and they show predominantly Reds and Oranges. Some
Blues and Greens are still visible.
