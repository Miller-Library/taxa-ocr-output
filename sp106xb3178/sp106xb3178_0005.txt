trigger Phl turnover to a large degree, while Group B agonists trigger it
to a somewhat lesser extent. Oftentimes, the degree of response to the
various muscarinic agonists can indicate whether or not Phi turnover is
involved in the system. Solely on the basis of agonist binding
experiments, the results of this study are too preliminaru to assess the
role of Phl turnover in iridescence. Oxotremorine, a Group B agonist, did
elicit a less dramatic response than ang of the Group A agonists that
were applied, but CBMC, also a Group B agonist, gave just as strong a
response. Other methods of determining Phl involvement were required.
Effect of Li', myo-inositol
The cation, Li', provides one of the few ways to selectivelu
inhibit the cycle of Phl turnover, thereby providing a method for testing
the role of Phl involvement (Drummond et al, 1986). LiCl (lOmM) was
added to a bath containing a semi-iridescent preparation. After 30
minutes, no change in the level of iridescence was observed. After 45
minutes, iridescence began to fade, and after an hour, there was a
substantial decrease in iridescence. 10 m myo-inositol was then added
to the bath, and iridescence returned within 30 seconds to a minute.
This procedure was repeated twice. The first repeat showed no fading of
virtually full iridescence after an hour, and addition of myo-inositol did
not increase it. The second repeat resulted in fading of a
semi-iridescent preparation after 30 minutes, but addition of
myo-inositol did not have ang effect.
Effect of 2ero Ca Ses Water
There is some evidence that Ca' is required for iridescence
(Cooper and Hanlon, 1986), and muscarin has been shown to affect Ca'
