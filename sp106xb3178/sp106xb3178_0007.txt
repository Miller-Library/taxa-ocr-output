subtipes, MI and M2, each able to express more than one conformational
state (Fisher and Bartus, 1985). pirenzipine specificallu blocks the Mi
subtupe (Fisher and Bartus, 1985), and on the basis of this result, it
seems that iridocytes possess at least the MI tupe of muscarinic
receptor.
The distinction between the two muscarinic receptor subtupes
based on the effects on Phl turnover is still vaque (Fisher and Bartus.
1985). Comparisons of the effectiveness of Group A and B agonists also
gield inconclusive evidence whether Phl turnover is involved in the
induction of iridescence. A role for Phl turnover is suggested in
iridescence on the basis of the experiment involving Li and
myo-inositol. Addition of Li' to cells has been shown to induce a sharp
decrease in myo-inositol concentrations, while causing a drastic
increase in myo-inositol 1-phosphate levels, apparently by inhibiting
the enzyme myo-inositol 1-phosphatase (Allison et al, 1976). Ph
breskdown products that are known secondarg messengers, IP- and DAG
occur well before the myo-inositol 1-phosphatase step in the pathwad,
and Li' action has been hupothesized to occur by depleting the Fhi pool of
mgo-inositol, therebg rendering it unable to regenerate Phl, and placing
the turnover mechaniem into check (Berridge et al, 1982). The cell can
either absort myo-inositol through the plasma mernbrane or sunthesize
it from glucose (Drummond et al, 1986). The fading of iridescence upon
addition of small concentrations of Li' can be correlated with a
depletion of myo-inositol from the Phl pool, since addition of
myo-inositol seems to restore iridescence, at least to some degree, The
preparation that did not fade after an hour perhaps had an inordinatelu
high Phl pool that was not get depleted.
The Fhl breakdown product, IFz, may act by releasing Cat from
