intracellular stores. Roger Hanlon and Kag Cooper have been
investigating the role of Caâ€œ in iridocyte iridescence of L. Brevis.
Addition of the Ca ionophore 423187 to a bath solution containing Ca"
caused an increase in iridescence. Verapamil, a Ca channel blocker,
inhibited agonist-induced iridescence to a great degree. Addition of the
agonist ACh to a zero Ca bath solution resulted in a brief increase in
iridescence that could not be maintained (Hanlon and Cooper, 1986). The
zero Ca sea water experiment executed in this study implied that Ca"
was required in the external medium to induce iridescence. However.
the 50 minute bathing period might be ample time for intracellular
stores to become depleted; therefore, Hanlon's experiment with zerg
Car sea water mag indeed support the theory of releasing Ca from
intracellular stores. Agonist binding resulted in a brief increase in
iridescence, perhaps associated with this intracellular Ca release.
Internal Ca pumps would then have removed Ca' from the cell where
it would be chelated in the external medium.
cAMP levels may also have an important modulating effect on the
iridescence of squid iridocutes. Huscarinic agonist binding has been
shown, in some cases, to decrease sunthesis of CAMP (Birdsall et al,
1983). The results of the forskolin and caffeine experiment may indicate
that cAMP levels cannot be too high if the iridocute is to maintain
iridescence. This does not necessarily imply that agonist binding in
iridocytes decresses cAMP levels, but it does seem to show that high
levels of intracellular CAMF produce some kind of inhibitorg effect on
iridescence. In general, muscarinic agonists affect cAMP levels by
linking to the G, protein that inhibits adenglate cyclase, therebg
decressing sunthesis of CAMP. A useful follow up experiment would then
be to test the effect of cholers and pertussis tokins on iridocyte
