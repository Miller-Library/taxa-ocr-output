iridescence, since theg are known to affect cAMP sunthesis by acting on
the G protein.
Consideration of these aspects of intracellular mediation of the
receptor signal, has led to four receptor models that attempt to link the
receptor to Phl turnover and to inhibition of cAMP sunthesis. (See
Figures 1 to 4.) Theg assume that the Car rise is under control of IPz,
one of the products in the Phl cycle.
EECEPTOR MODEL 1: The receptor is linked directlg to
Phospholipase C, the enzyme involved in the initial stages of Fhl
turnover. Activation of this enzyme sets this pathwag into motion. The
products of Fhl turnover then either stimulate the G; protein to inhibit
adenglate cuclase and decrease overall cAMP synthesis, or theg inhibit
adenglate cyclase directly. IP causes Ca- release to turn on
iridescence.
EECEETOP MODEL 2: Two receptors are used: one directig linked
to Fhospholipase C, and the other to the G, protein. The two receptors
may have different binding affinities, affecting each process to varging
degrees. There is some evidence that muscarinic receptors mag each
interconvert to high and low affinity forms, adding another aspect to
requlation and allowing more flexibilty in the system.
FECEPTOR HODEL3 There is one receptor directlg linked to both
Phospholipase C and the G;. Agonist binding would cause a joint effect,
triggering both aspects of the system at once.
PECEPTOR HODEL 4: Both Fhospholipsse C and the G, protein are
under control of a single receptor, but the receptor is linked to only one
of them at ang given time. The receptor interconverts between high and
