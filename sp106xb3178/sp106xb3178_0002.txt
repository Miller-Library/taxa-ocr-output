produce structural colors in a manner similar to a diffraction grating;
and reflector cells, which produce structural colors via thin-film
interference (Brocco and Cloneg, 1983). In Loliga, reflector cells are
located chiefly above the iris, on the ink sac and other internal organs.
The iridocutes are found in the skin over the whole body of the squid,
and are arranged in donut-shaped splotches in the third dermal lager of
the dorsal mantle. Iridescence of iridocytes seems to be caused by the
organization of iridosomal platelets of high refractive index located on
the periphery of the cell and surrounded by infoldings of the
plasmalemma (Brocco and Cloneg, 1980). These platelets are aligned on
edge, perpendicular to the integument of the squid (Sch√§fer, 1938,
Kawaguti and Ohgishi, 1962, Hirow, 1972).
Iridocutes differ from reflector cells not only in the mechanism
bu which they produce structural iridescence, but also in their ability to
change their iridescent properties. The neurotransmitter acetulcholine
(AChl causes a change in the strength of iridescence (Cooper and Hanlon,
1966), although no one has get successfully identified the innervation of
the iridocute dermal lager. This study was conducted to characterize the
nature of the receptor responsible for that effect, and the possible
signal transduction mechanisms that mag help mediate the structursl
changes involved in iridescence.
HATERIALS AND METHODS
ACh, atropine, tubocurarine, forskolin, caffeine, LiCl, EGTA,
HEPES and muo-inositol were obtained from Sigma Chemical.
Carbamulcholine, ABMC, CEHE, oxotremorine, pirenzipine,
quinuclidinul benzilate (ONB), and scopolamine were the kind gift of
Anthong Horielli. Loligo opalescens were collected from Montereg Bag
