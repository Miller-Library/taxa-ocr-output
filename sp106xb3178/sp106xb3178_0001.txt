ASSTRACT
Cholinergic receptors controlling iridescence in the iridophores
of Loligo opalescens were found to be muscarinic. Selective agonists and
antagonists were applied, and responsiveness was measured by a change
in iridescence. Carbamulcholine and acetyl-beta-methgl-choline (ABHE)
are group A muscarinic agonists that elicited positive responses.
Effective group B agonists included carbamul-beta-methyl-choline
(CBMC) and oxotremorine. Atropine, scopolamine, and pirenzipine are
muscarinic antagonists that effectively hindered iridescence, while
tubocurarine, a nicotinic antagonist, did not block iridescence. Agonist
groupings are based on their ability to turn over phoshatidglinosito
(Phl). The results of these agonistsfantagonists combined with the
effect of Li and subsequent addition of myo-inositol, show that Phi
turnover mag be involved. Li' selectively inhibits a step in the Phl
pathwau. Lif was found to decrease iridescence and addition of
muo-inositol seemed to cause its reappearance. Ca seems to be
involved, since addition of an agonist in zero Ca' sea water did not
result in iridescence. Addition of forskolin and caffeine resulted in a
decrease in iridescence, impluing that high cAMP levels inhibit the
response. From this data four receptor models were constructed.
INTEODUCTION
Iridophores, specialized cells in the skin of squid produce
structural iridescence bu either diffraction or thin film interference
mechaniems (Sch√§fer, 1938, Brocco and Cloneg, 1980). Two types of
iridophore cells are recognized: iridocutes, cells that apparently
