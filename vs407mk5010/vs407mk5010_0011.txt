hatchlings. Isolated embryos developed eyes and chromatophores in
both the sterile and natural sea water solutions (Figure 1), but soon
after deteriorated into cloudy chorions impossible to stage (Figure 2)
The natural sea water embryos degenerated before the embryos in
the sterile sea water (Chart 1, Graph 1). By t=16 days, small, mobile
specks identified as protozoa were seen associated with the chorion
surfaces when all embryos appeared dead. Tissue samples from both
sea water solutions along with some natural sea water solution were
plated.
In vitro fertilization: Unfertilized eggs from freshly dead females
deteriorated quickly (t=2 days). Just as rapidly, both the sterile and
natural sea water in vitro fertilization eggs degenerated (Figures 3,4)
Although a percentage of the unfertilized eggs were immature and
incapable of fertilization, in both sea water solutions chorions were
seen and used as evidence for fertilization. Both in vitro solutions
had distinct smells and were cloudy two days after fertilization.
Only dead embryos and lysed material remained by the second day.
Control Fingers: Hatchlings broke through the natural sea water
finger sheath on the sixteenth day in the water bath. Although low
in viability, embryos survived and developed into the hatchling
stage.
Shortly after the hatchlings broke emerged both of the natural sea
water fingers began to disintegrate. This tissue was plated for
bacterial and fungal attack. Especially noticeable was the thinning
and weakening of the sheaths which were unable to hold the
