Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Problems and Suggestions: The following suggestions may be
successful in overcoming some of the experimentsâ€™ ambiguities. First,
all egg fingers should come from a single source at a simultaneous
spawning time. For this, mature squid need to be captured and
induced to mate in the holding tanks. Unfortunately, due to time
constraints, egg fingers were collected from Monterey Bay by staff
scuba divers and later from the holding tanks. A second suggestion
eliminates worries concerning the effects of stationary solutions;
paddles should be used to provide a consistent, continual circulation
over the egg fingers and finger parts. Next, a larger-sized container
might possibly decrease complications associated with a limited
volume solution. Fourth, more antibiotic testing needs to be done to
eliminate the experimental results seen as a reaction to the antibiotic
influence (as opposed to absence of bacteria). Finally, the
temperature needs to remain stable to insure consistent conditions.
The isolated embryos and in vitro fertilized eggs were just as
susceptible to the effects of the uncirculating sea water solutions as
the control fingers. But, the difference in days of normal
development hold. The lack of circulation may have stimulated the
growth of a bacterial infection in all beakers, but the separate tissue
sections responded differently. The in vitro fertilized eggs died
within two days; the absence of an association with the sheath and
its bacteria explain the quick deterioration. The embryos associated
and separated from the sheath lasted longer (SSW t=12, SW t=10)
than the in vitro fertilized eggs, but shorter than the whole fingers.
