Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
chorions were seen although most embryos appeared transparent
and healthy. A few embryos did show distinctive features
characteristic of more advanced stages. These more advanced
embryos were used as evidence for the healthy, but slow,
development of the younger embryos. The fingers transferred from
sterile sea water into the antibiotic solution initially appeared
healthy. However, as time and development progressed, the eg
fingers in the antibiotic solution failed to continue development
(t=21).
To confirm that all bacteria were eliminated by the antibiotics, the
antibiotic solution that the fingers had been immersed in was plated
onto marine agar and incubated overnight. This was done several
times throughout the experiment. Finger tissue immersed in the
antibiotic solution was plated once. An orange colored bacteria
eventually grew on some of the streaked plates. Not present in a
concentration large enough to fear infection, only a handful of orange
colonies grew when 100 ul of used antibiotic solution was streaked
onto the nutrient-rich marine agar plates. The streptomycin-
rifampicin solution effectively eliminated the broad majority of
finger bacteria.
Development following a transient antibiotic treatment:
Egg fingers placed into sterile sea water following the five day
antibiotic treatment appeared normal, but slow in development. At
t=17 days in the water bath, most sterile sea water fingers showed
no beginning of organogenesis (Segawaâ€™s stage 8). Similarly, the
