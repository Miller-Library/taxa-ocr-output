Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
minimal, protection to the embryos. The growth of infectious
bacteria and fungi also takes time.
Embryos: Isolated embryos appeared unable to develop into the
hatchling stage without the sheath. However, the factor(s) which
prevented the SSW control fingers from hatching may also be
blocking the development of the embryos. The embryos developed
in conditions uniform with the fingers; sea water solutions were
changed every third day and they shared the same water bath.
In Vitro Fertilization: Both sterile and natural sea water in vitro
fertilizations failed to progress past the second day. Removed from
dead females' ovaries, the unfertilized eggs had no association with
the sheath and its bacteria. The rapid deterioration of both in vitro
fertilizations and unfertilized eggs support the hypothesis that the
sheath bacteria are symbionts of the squid embryos.
Identified infectant: Identified with the Biolog system, the
bacteria associated within the cloudy chorions of the SW embryos
was Vibrio harveyi B. V. harveyi B is associated with high
mortality rates of the pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima Jamson (Pass et
al, 1987). The increased occurrences of infection in the pearl oysters
were attributed to inadequate water circulation. Of the eight
beakers, none were equipped with a circulating flow. Thus, perhaps
their exists a correlation between the absence of a circulating flow
and the V. harveyi Binfection.
