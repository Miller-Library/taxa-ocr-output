Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
(AN) gland was pointed to as the probable source of the sheath
bacteria. It has been observed that the AN lumen becomes filled
with several types of symbiotic bacteria with sexual maturation
(Richard et al, 1979; Buchner, 1965). However, the function of the
AN gland and the sheath bacteria is unknown (Lum-Kong, 1992a).
Symbiotic marine bacteria provides protection for other systems.
The embryos of the shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus (Gil-Turnes et
al, 1989) and lobster Homarus americanus (Gil-Turnes and Fenical,
1992) demonstrate a remarkable ability to resist infection by the
fungus, Lagenidium callinectes. In the Hawaiian squid, Euprymna
scolopes, luminous symbiotic bacteria are needed for the maturation
and development of the light organ (McFall-Ngai and Ruby, 1991).
The following experiments attempted to determine the
relationship between the sheath bacteria and the squid embryos. By
separating the bacteria-associated sheath from the developing
embryos, and later eliminating all bacteria with antibiotics, the
development of the squid embryos was observed. When separated
from the sheath, the embryos with the least sheath association
suffered the earliest mortality. The longer the development with
the encasing the sheath, the greater the development of the embryos.
In another experiment, the sheath remained while the sheath
bacteria were removed with the use of antibiotics. The fingers that
were stripped of bacteria showed a greater susceptibility when
exposed to two fungal-rich solutions. The following experiments
support the symbiotic relationship of the bacteria with the
developing embryos.
