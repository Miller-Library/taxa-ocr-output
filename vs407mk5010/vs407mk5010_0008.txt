Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
10 mg SBTI/ml, five milliliters (ml) EDTA and 1.5 ml SBTI were
mixed into 500 ml sterile sea water. EDTA inhibits metalloproteases
whereas SBTI inhibits trypsin (product information). The acidic (pH
4.5) solution was then brought up to -pH 7.6 with the addition of 1 M
NaoH.
Effect of Protease Inhibition On Hatching: Egg fingers rinsed
with SSW were placed into the protease inhibition solution to study
hatching. The solution was changed every third day to insure
freshness. Like the antibiotic solution, the used protease inhibition
solution was also streaked onto marine agar plates to test for
bacterial activity.
Results
Development in the antibiotic solution: The fingers immersed
in the rifampicin-streptomycin antibiotic solution were collected by
staff scuba divers. The fingers used as the sterile sea water control
were gathered from the holding tanks from captured squid.
Fingers placed in the antibiotic solution following a sterile sea
water wash developed normally, but at an unusually slow rate. At
t=17 days in the water bath, no depression separating the future
external yolk sac from the future embryonic body could be seen on
most embryos (younger than Segawaâ€™s stage 8). A few cloudy
