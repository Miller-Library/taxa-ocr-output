Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
enclosed embryos. No hatchlings emerged from the sterile sea water
control. Enclosed in the sheath, embryos developed eyes and
chromatophores before turning opaque in color. Unlike the natural
sea water fingersâ€™ sheaths, the sheath remained intact around the
still embryos.
Sheaths: The separated sheaths in both sterile sea water and
natural sea water appeared seemed unaffected by their separation
from the embryos; no bacterial or fungal attack was seen on the
sheath surfaces. In both sea water solutions, the sheaths thickened.
Toward the end of the experiment (t-22 days), the natural sea water
sheaths appeared slightly discolored. Intact fingers held in tanks
with a constant flow of natural sea water demonstrated the same
discoloration likely to be algal settlement. Overall, the sheaths in
both sea water solutions appeared basically unaffected by their
separation from the embryo-chorion mass.
Bacteria Identification via Biolog: Samples of SSW and SW
embryo tissue, along with SW embryo solution, were spread (100 ul
plate) onto marine agar plates. Bacteria isolated from the SW
embryo tissue was examined using the commercially available Biolog
identification kit (Hayward, California). The bacteria associated
within the chorion of the cloudy SW embryos was identified as
Vibrio harveyi B.
