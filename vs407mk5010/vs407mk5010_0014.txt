Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Correlation between sheath association and embryo
survival- development: Control Fingers: Although the sterile sea
water control fingers failed to bear healthy hatchlings, the SSW
fingers followed normal development (Segawa et al, 1988; Arnold,
1965) until the eighteenth day in the fluctuating water bath.
Similarly at t=18 days, the whole fingers immersed in the natural sea
water began to deviate from the detailed accounts of normal
development. Unlike the sterile sea water fingers, the natural sea
water fingers did yield hatchlings beginning on the sixteenth day in
the water bath. The reasons for the discrepancy in hatchling results
between the sterile and natural sea water solutions may be
explained by the occasional wild temperature fluctuations in the
water bath. Except for sterile versus natural sea water, all aspects of
the experiment treated the two egg finger groups identically. Thus,
it seems unlikely that the sterile sea water fingers would succumb to
an infection when the natural sea water fingers yielded hatchlings.
Although changed every third day, perhaps the SSW fingers were
more sensitive to the lack of circulating water than the SW fingers.
In either case, both fingers developed until t=18 days before signs
of abnormality surfaced. The SSW and SW isolated embryos did not
last as long. The SSW embryos began to look irregular on t-12 days.
and the SWembryos deviated earlier at t=10 days. Without the
sheath and its associated symbionts, the isolated embryos were more
susceptible to infection than the intact fingers. The embryos
developed through several stages before deteriorating; perhaps
several layers of the sheath remained associated providing some, if
