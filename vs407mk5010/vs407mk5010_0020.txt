Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Again, the association with the sheath and its bacteria comply with
the normal development time of the different tissue types. With no
sheath association, the in vitro fertilized and unfertilized eggs rapidly
worsened. The embryos, with an initial association with the sheath,
lasted longer but still failed to yield hatchlings. Never separated
from the sheath, the intact fingersâ€™ embryos in both sterile and
natural sea water solutions developed and survived the longest.
When the sheath remained but the bacteria were removed, the
fingers which were transferred from the antibiotic solution to the
fungal-rich solutions demonstrated the largest irregularities in
development. Either by removing the sheath with forceps, or
stripping the bacteria with antibiotics, the unprotected embryos
appeared more susceptible to infection and developmental
irregularities when compared to the embryos with the sheath
bacteria. Thus, the sheath associated bacteria appear to be
symbionts of the developing L. opalescens embryos.
