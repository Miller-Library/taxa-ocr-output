Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
transcription. Bactericidal streptomycin irreversibly binds to a
ribosomal subunit thereby decreasing the rate of translation while
increasing the chance of misreading (Volk et al, 1986).
With a final pH of 8.2, the following final concentrations were used
in the streptomycin-rifampicin antibiotic solution; streptomycin: 100
ug/ 1 ml distilled water; rifampicin:100 ug/ 1 ml DMSO. A milliliter
(ml) of each 100x stock solution was diluted with 1 liter (L) of sterile
sea water (SSW). Besides being replaced daily for freshness, the
antibiotic solution was tested for efficacy in vitro. Following the egg
fingers marinade in the antibiotic solution, 100 ul of the used
antibiotic solution was plated onto marine agar plates to monitor any
bacterial growth on the nutrient-sufficient medium.
The streptomycin-rifampicin antibiotic combination demonstrated
no effect on Strongylocentrotus purpuratus fertilization or short term
(tÂ« 2 days) development.
Assaying embryo development in antibiotic solution: Newly
laid egg fingers were placed into the antibiotic solution after several
washes in sterile sea water (Diagram 1). To monitor development,
the fingers were periodically (-3 days) removed and examined using
light microscopy. Concurrently, egg fingers developing in sterile sea
water were transferred into the antibiotic solution every three days.
Using sterile techniques, egg fingers which underwent their entire
development in sterile sea water served as controls.
