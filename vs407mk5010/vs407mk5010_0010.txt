Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
natural sea water fingers looked like they were developing slowly
and normally. The fingers placed in the fungal-rich solution of R.
glutinis were also developing slowly (when compared to the sterile
sea water control). Besides slow development, many of the R.
glutinis embryos were peculiar in shape (snowman-like). Not
circular, the embryo shapes failed to resemble forms drawn and
described by either Arnold or Segawa. More suspicious were the
embryos removed from the L. callinectes fingers. A mist was seen in
the chorions of the L. callinectes fingers; this mist did not resemble
the particulate debris viewed in other embryos. Also, development
appeared stalled and embryos unusually large. By t-21, normal
embryos were seen (younger than Segawaâ€™s stage 8), but no normal
development. It was undetermined whether the embryos were
stalled in development or dead. No movement within the chorion
was seen. Tissue from the L. callinectes embryos were plated onto
yeast and marine agar.
Development of separate tissues in sterile sea water and
sea water: The egg fingers used in this experiment were gathered
from staff scuba divers off of Hopkins Marine Station. To
compensate for the ambiguity about the egg fingers' exact age, the
fingers were staged before beginning (Segawa et al, 1988; Arnold,
1965).
Embryos: When separated from the sheath, embryos in both
sterile sea water and natural sea water failed to develop into
