Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
water solution. Fungi-rich solution I (R. glutinis) finger embryos
appeared basically normal, but with strange embryo outlines. No
unusual debris or infection was seen. The second fungal-rich
solution (L. callinectes) had some strangely large embryos. Also
associated with the L. callinectes, a mist was seen within the chorions
that did not resemble the particulate matter previously seen in
healthy embryos. Embryo tissue streaked onto yeast and marine
agar produced mucoid, cream colonies. As of yet, no infectants have
been identified. The fungal-rich solutions looked a little unordinary
with unusual embryo shapes, sizes, and chorion mist. Beginning on
t=26, no circulation or movement within the chorion was seen.
Although the embryos may have been stalled in development, it is
also quite likely that they were dead.
Judging from the other experiments using the antibiotic solution, it
is quite probable that the streptomycin-rifampicin combination
caused a slowing, and ultimate stalling, in embryo development.
However, the egg fingers placed in the fungal-rich solutions following
the antibiotic treatment showed the greatest irregularities and at the
earliest time. Thus, the egg fingers stripped of the sheath bacteria
were more susceptible to the fungal-rich solutions than any of the
control egg fingers. The controls were fingers that received no
antibiotic treatment before placement in the fungal-rich solutions,
and fingers transferred from the antibiotic solution into sterile and
natural sea water solutions. The antibiotic solution may be blocking
embryo development, but still the hypothesis holds: fingers stripped
of the sheath bacteria via antibiotics showed a greater tendency to
deviate from normal development.
