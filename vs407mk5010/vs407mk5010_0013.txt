Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Discussion
The evidence suggests a direct correlation exists between the
period and extent of embryo development and the embryos'
association with the sheath. The longer the embryos' association
with the sheath, the greater the developmental stages reached. This
connection endorses the theory that the sheath-associated bacteria
are symbionts of the developing L. opalescens embryos. Ã–ther
experiments support this relationship. Following a transient
antibiotic treatment, egg fingers were placed into four different
media. Although the sheath remained, the sheath bacteria were
eliminated with the streptomycin-rifampicin antibiotic treatment.
These egg fingers which were stripped of their bacteria via
antibiotics then placed into fungal-rich solutions (R. glutinis, L.
callinectes) showed the greatest tendency to deviate from normal
development with unusual shapes, sizes, and chorion fluid. Although
the effects of the antibiotic, a fluctuating water bath temperature,
and the lack of circulation complicated the experiment, the uniform
treatments equalized the results. With no association with the
sheath, both in vitro fertilizations rapidly degenerated. The finger
embryos, which underwent their entire development encased in the
sheath, demonstrated the greatest development and the longest
survival time.
Note: For the development of separate tissues, the time (t=16 days)
refers to time in the water bath not time since spawning.
