Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
long axis, the finger can be divided into the sheath and embryos.
Sheath: The sheath contains bacteria and is the wrapping or case
surrounding the cluster of embryos. Once unwrapped (from the
embryos), the separated sheath contains no embryos. Embryos:
After the removal of the sheath, the embryo-chorion mass remains.
This mass consists of developing fertilized eggs. The chorion,
generally described as the secondary envelope (the primary
envelope being the vitelline membrane), is a product of the follicular
cells (Boletzky, 1986). After fertilization, the egg shrinks widening
the space between the just fertilized egg and its surrounding chorion
(Fields, 1965). In vitro fertilization: Unfertilized eggs removed from
ovaries and sperm taken from the spermatophores are the sources of
the gametes used in in vitro fertilization.
Antibiotic sensitivity testing: To determine the significance of
the symbiotic bacteria on embryological development, an effective
antibiotic solution was needed to eliminate all sheath-associated
bacteria. Thirty-six representative strains previously isolated from
the squid accessory nidamental (AN) gland and egg sheath were
streaked onto five plates each containing a separate antibiotic
(tetracycline 15 ug/ml, kanamycin 40 ug/ml, streptomycin 100
ug/ml, rifampicin 100 ug/ml, ampicillin 100 ug/ml). The plates were
then incubated overnight at room temperature. When compared to
the control of marine agar (MA), the combination of rifampicin and
streptomycin inhibited the growth of all thirty-six strains.
