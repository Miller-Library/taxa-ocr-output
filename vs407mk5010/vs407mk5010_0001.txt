Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Studies on the Embryological Development of the Squid
Loligo opalescens and Symbiotic Sheath Bacteria
Abstrac
Encased within a bacteria associated sheath, the embryos of the
squid Loligo opalescens are able to withstand a three to five week
incubation period on the ocean floor. It appears that the unidentified
bacteria are symbionts of the developing embryos; the longer the
association with the sheath, the further the development of the
embryos. When the sheath remained, but the bacteria was removed
with antibiotics, the stripped fingers showed a greater susceptibilty
when exposed to fungal-rich solutions. The experimental evidence
suggests that the sheath bacteria are symbionts of the developing
Loligo opalescens embryos.
Introduction
The market squid Loligo opalescens inhabits the waters along the
west coast of North America (Hixon, 1983). After mating, females
deposit twenty or more finger-like gelatinous masses containing
between 115 to 300 embryos (Strathmann, 1987). Inexplicably, the
embryos of the squid Loligo opalescens withstand a three to five
week incubation period on subtidal sandy substrates resisting fungal,
microbial, and animal predation.
Discovered and described several years ago, the egg capsule
sheath of Loligo opalescens contains one to five layers of bacteria
(Biggs and Epel, 1991). With the structural properties of a secretory
organ (Bloodgood, 1977), the female squidsâ€™ accessory nidamental
