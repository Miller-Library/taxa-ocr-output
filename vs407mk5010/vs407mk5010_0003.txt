Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Materials and Methods
General: Loligo opalescens were captured in Monterey Bay during
May 1994, placed in circular, 2000 L holding tanks with continual
flow, and induced to mate by the presence of egg fingers gathered by
staff scuba divers. Additional egg fingers were collected from scuba
divers offshore from Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey Bay.
Freshly dead squid were collected from fishing boats for in vitro
fertilization.
The standard arrangement for following development and effects
of antibiotics in the egg fingers consisted of tying fingers to
autoclaved string attached to a weight. Plastic petri dishes covered
the sterile glass beakers. All beakers were placed in a water bath
which fluctuated between 16-18 C. Throughout the experiments,
embryos were aged according to stages rather than days.
Temperature influences the developmental schedule, the higher the
temperature the shorter the incubation period (Fields, 1965;
Strathmann, 1987). All solutions (sterile sea water, natural sea
water, fungal-rich and protease inhibition solutions) were changed
at least every third day. Natural sea water came directly from
Monterey Bay.
Terms: Finger: The finger, with its bacteria associated sheath and
embryo-chorion mass, is what is naturally laid and attached to sandy
substrates. By cutting both ends and making an incision along the
