Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
chorion portion. These six (fingers, sheath, embryos in both SSW and
SW) beakers were set up simultaneously from egg fingers collected
by staff scuba divers. Unfertilized eggs and sperm were removed
from freshly dead squid and fertilized in vitro.
Embryo development was monitored in the intact fingers, isolated
embryos, and in vitro fertilizations. The sheath, separated from all
embryos, was watched for any general observations as discoloration.
thickening, or surface texture. All four parts (fingers, sheath,
embryos, in vitro fertilizations) were placed in both sterile and
natural sea water solutions. All eight beakers were checked and
their solutions changed every third day. The isolated embryos were
staged every third day.
Protease Inhibition Solution: To examine the relationship
between bacterial protease secretion and/or development, hatching,
and anti-fungal activity, the effects of protease inhibition on
bacterial proteases were examined. The experiments below
ascertained which inhibitors prevented protease activity. Five of the
representative thirty-six (including two negative controls) bacterial
strains and a concentrated protease were plated onto marine agar
plates overlaid with a known protease inhibitor. Four protease
inhibitors were individually placed on a marine agar plate; 1 uM
leupeptin, 1 um pepstatin, O.5 mM EDTA, 30 um SBTI. A plain plate
of marine agar was the control. The plates were incubated overnight
at room temperature. From these streaks a protease inhibition
solution (PIS) was created. From stock solutions of O.5 mM EDTA and
