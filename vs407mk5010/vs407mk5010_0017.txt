Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
in developing. However, the fingers which were transferred into the
antibiotic solution earlier were much smaller than the fingers
transferred from the SSW later. In all transferred fingers (t=O, 3, 6,
9, 12 days), no features characteristic of organogenesis were visible.
The fingers transferred at different times resembled one another in
developmental stages, but differed in finger size.
Protease Inhibition Development: Like the antibiotic fingers,
the fingers immersed in the protease inhibitor solution (younger
than Segawaâ€™s stage 9: t=16 days in solution) also displayed normal,
but slow, development initially. As of t=24, the egg fingers in the
protease inhibition solution failed to show the rudimentary optic
vesicles or primordium shell gland indicative of the beginning of
organogenesis (Segawa, 1988). Development was prominently
behind the natural sea water control; they appeared retarded in
development. It is undetermined whether the protease inhibition,
the protease inhibition solution, or both were responsible for the
slow, and eventually stalled, development of the embryos.
The effect of the protease inhibition on hatching could not be
studied since the embryos stalled in development.
Different media following antibiotic treatment: The testing of
different media following transient antibiotic treatment gave more
evidence for the necessity of the symbiotic sheath bacteria in
embryological development. The fingers immersed in sterile sea
water appeared normal, along with the fingers in the natural sea
