Nakashima: Loligo opalescens Embryo Development and Sheath Bacteria
Development following transient antibiotic treatment: To
determine the egg fingers' susceptibility to infection in the absence
of symbionts, fingers were rinsed in SSW and placed in the
rifampicin-streptomycin antibiotic solution (Diagram 2). After five
days, the fingers were divided into four solutions: sterile sea water,
natural sea water, fungal-rich solution I (Lagenidium callinectes)
fungal-rich solution II (Rhodotorula glutinis). A scoop of L.
callinectes, transferred from a frozen glycerol and plated onto a
marine agar plate, was placed into the fungal-rich I solution; 500 ul
of an overnight culture of R. glutinis was inoculated into the 500 mls
SSW containing fingers in fungal-rich II solution. Both fungal-rich
solutions consisted of fungi added to sterile sea water. All fingers
were examined using light microscopy and sterile techniques every
third day. I specifically examined the encasing sheath surfaces for
fungal attack. Normal fingers were placed in both fungal-rich
solutions as the control after a rinse with sterile sea water. Fingers
placed in sterile sea water after a five day marinade in antibiotics
were a second control.
Development of separate tissues in sterile sea water and
sea water: To determine how the separate components (intact
fingers, sheath, embryos) of the finger developed in isolation, the
different parts of the finger were dissected (Diagram 3). Using
sterile techniques, intact fingers were longitudinally cut and their
chorion-embryo mass removed. Unwrapped from all embryos, the
separated sheaths were placed apart from the remaining embryoÂ¬
