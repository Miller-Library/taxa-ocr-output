Materials and Methods.
The nudibranch mollusk Melibe leonina was collected in the
kelp beds near Delmonte Beach in Monterey Bay, California, at a
depth of between 10 and 20 feet. The experimental animals were
between 9 and 18 cm long; these large animals swim at a known rate
which aids identification of Int.1. The animals were held in tanks
kept fresh and at sea temperature (-13-15C) by a constant trickle of
sea water. Pieces of kelp (Macrosystis) provided a substratum. The
Melibe were fed both mysids (collected in the kelp beds off of
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California) and commercially
grown brine shrimp. Whenever possible, the Melibe were fed the
more nutritious mysids (Freya Sommer, personal communication).
Dissection
All experiments were performed on the excised central ganglia
of Melibe leonina. Taking care to keep the ganglia submerged in sea
water, ganglia were exposed by making a single slit in the membrane
directly above the ganglia. First the nerve roots, then surrounding
connective tissue and the esophagus directly caudal, and rostral to
the ganglia were cut, leaving the ganglia and a bit of the esophagus
detached from the rest of the animal. Care was taken not to damage
the two largest circumesophageal connectives.
Within three minutes of the first cut, the ganglia and a bit of
the esophagus were excised from the animal, and placed in Ã 
chamber filled with ASW (-11C) and chilled by Peltier chip. The
remaining esophagus was then cut free from the circum esophageals,
and the ganglia were pinned to the bottom of the chamber by the
attached connective tissue. The ganglia were soaked in EB saline for
35 minutes. EB was then replaced by HiOz saline and the ganglia
were pinned down more firmly, exposing one of the Int.Is, the region
of one of the Pleural ganglia just rostral to the tentacular lobe. That
area was then desheathed with a pair of fine forceps. Finally, the
HiOz saline in the chamber was replaced by ASW (via perfusion-see
below).
