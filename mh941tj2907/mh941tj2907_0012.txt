Future Directions
Future experiments should determine the cell (or cells)
responsible for this patterned excitation of Int.1. By recording
simultaneously from Int.2 and Int.1, while doing the Hi Di, and OCa
manipulations, one could test the hypothesis that the excitatory input
to Int.1 comes directly from Int.2. Simultaneous recordings from
every pair of the identified cells in this network during regular firing
could yield important information about the order, and
synchronization of the four cells. This information could be used to
support or weaken the hypothesis that neither of the two
antagonistic neurons can be directly responsible for the excitatory
input witnessed in Int.1. In fact, this information would be essential
to any computational model that might be developed to test the
general validity of hypotheses about the various mechanisms that
make up this network.
Though Int.1 is clearly getting patterned excitatory input, it is
not necessarily true that that input is responsible for all, or even
most of the current flow that we observe as oscillating voltage in
Int.1. It could be that the input is riding upon a wave of voltage
fluctuation that is due to some endogenous property of the cell itself.
To test such a hypothesis, one could watch for voltage oscillations in
Int.1 while attempting to block all of the spiking activity in the
whole ganglia (TTX), and hence block all extracellular input into
Int.1.
