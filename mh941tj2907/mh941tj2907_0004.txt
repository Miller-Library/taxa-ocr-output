per side, one each in the Pleural and Pedal ganglia (fig 1). These cells
have been labeled the right and left Interneuron 1s (Pleural ganglia),
and right and left Interneuron 2s (Pedal). The Int.1, and Int.2 of
each side are thought to normally fire bursts of about 40 spikes
synergistically with each other, and antagonistically (and thus in
inverse phase) with the interneurons on the opposing ganglia. When
the interneurons of one side fire, it is thought that those on the
opposing side are silent. On either side, during a burst of action
potentials, Int.1 begins before Int.2, and Int.2 is thought to continue
firing after Int.l becomes quiescent. Since there is an electrical
coupling between Int.1l and Int.2 (Thompson, personal
communication) it is easy to suppose that Int.1 triggers bursting in
Int.2. Less apparent, though, is the mechanism that triggers Int.1.
This paper describes an attempt to sort out the sort of mechanism
that controls bursting in Int.1.
