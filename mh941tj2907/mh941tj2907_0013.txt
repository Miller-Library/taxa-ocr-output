Acknowledgements
First and foremost, I thank Stuart Thompson. Not only has
he aided me greatly with this project, but, put bluntly, were it
not for him, I would be planning to do something other with my
life than science. No amount of gratitude will ever be close to
enough.
I thank Sam wang
from whom I have learned the bulk of my
science knowledge.
am grateful to William Gilly for lots of
technical assistance,
Freya Sommer who helped with the animals,
Alan Baldridge and Susan Baxter, Anthony Morielli, David Epel and
Chuck Baxter both of whom supplied encouragement, Mary Lucero,
and Jennifer Levitt.
Thanks especially to my peers in the spring class, Dianne,
Shannon, and Simone for emotional support of both me and the
slugs. Finally, I thank the whole Hopkins community that was
exceptionally pleasant and generally helpful.
