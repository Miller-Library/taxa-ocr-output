Perfusion
Saline changes were done by flushing an amount of saline that
equaled 10 times the volume of the chamber over the ganglia, taking
care to keep the ganglia beneath water level at all times.
Electrophysiology
A glass pipette with a tip diameter of
Extracellular.
approximately 20-50 um was attached to the cell body of Int.l by
suction. Somatic currents were amplified with a Grass differential
amplifier. Data was recorded on a chart recorder (Gould/Brush 220).
The cell body of Int.1 was impaled with a 2-8
Intracellular.
Mohm glass microelectrode backfilled with 3 M KCl. The
transmembrane voltage was amplified with either a Getting micro
electrode amplifier (Model 5). Voltages were recorded on a chart
recorder (Gould/Brush 220).
Serotonin (5HT) In some preparations, the neural circuit is not
functioning (Jones, personal communication). It is believed that
washing the ganglia with a 5HT saline can prompt the circuit to start
functioning. (Jones, personal communication) In preparations wh√®re
we had trouble locating Int.1, we did this, hoping that it would
initiate the bursting behavior of the cell, and enable us to identify
the cell.
