abstract
Interneuron 1 of the Melibe swimming CPG was studied with
both intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological
techniques. By varying the concentrations of Calcium and
Magnesium in the extracellular saline, an oscillating voltage
that happenned in the absence of action potentials was observed
in Interneuron 1. These results were taken to indicate that
Interneuron 1 is driven at least in part by a wave of
extracellular excitation.
