1. The clotting mechanism of Balanus nubilt
was found to be affected by calcium ion with a
threshold value for induced clot formation of blood
i
diluted 1:3:l w
h 10% EDTA and 3% Naol respectively
falling between 0.025M and O.1M calcium chloride.
2. The clotting mechanism of B. nubilus was
also found to be affected by hydrogen ion concen¬
tration with an optimum value for clot formation at
a ph value of approximately 6.7.
TNA
INTRODUCTION
The blood clot formed in decapod crustaceans
was described by Fredericg (1879) and Halliburton
(1665) as a jelly-like aglutination, consisting of
a cross-hatching of fibers to which is attached an
amorphous, granulated gel. Although
avind (1948)
obse
ved an effect induced by variations in hydrogen
ion conent
ation and alium io on the clot
ng mech¬
anism in some decapod crustaceans, no investigation
of the effect of hydrogen ion and calcium ion on
the process in cirripeds has been reported.
This is a report of a study of the clotting
mechanism of Balanus nubilus (Darwin, 1854) and
the effect of calcium ion and hydrogen ion on the
process.
MATERIALS AND
THODS
Specimens of B. nubilus were collected with

their basal calcareous plates intact from the pliings
of Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California, and kept
