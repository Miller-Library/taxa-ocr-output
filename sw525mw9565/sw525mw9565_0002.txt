in running sea water until used.
The blood was removed by puncturing the basal
plate, removing excess debris w
ith forceps, and
mantle cavity fluid with a water aspirator. Blood
was withdra
n from the ventral thoracic sinus using

aone ml. plas
i syringe contain
ing 0.4 ml. of a
10 solution of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
disodium salt (EDTA) adjusted to a pH of 7.1 and fitted
with a 22-gauge needle coated with Beckman's
sicote, to minimize contact with wettable su
faces.
Generally, 0.6 ml. samples of blood were withdrawn
rred to a glass centrifuge tube conta:
ining
and transfe:
10% EDTA and 3% Nacl so that the final ratio of blood,
EDTA, and Nacl was 1:3:l respectively.
iis sample was then centrifuged immediately at
approximately 1500xG to remove any
particulate matter,
including any clot formed during the collect
tion of
blood. One ml. aliquots of the supernatant were used
in the eper
ntal procedures described below and
amounted to a l:5 dilution of the blood.
Acetate and tris (hydroxymethyl) a
inomethane
(Tris) buffers were prepared acco
ing to the method
of Gomori (1955); except buffers with a pH from 2.0
rom a mixture of 50 ml. of 0.2M
to 3.5 were preparedi
acetic acid (diluted to a total volume of 100 ml.)
and 5 ml. of 0.2M sodium acetate to which was added
glacial acetic acid until the mixture reached the
desired pH values. Similarly, buffers in the range from
6.7 to 10.0 were prepared from 50 ml. of a 0.2M Tris
solution (diluted to a total volume of 200 ml.) to
which was added Tris u
til the desired pH values were
reached.
