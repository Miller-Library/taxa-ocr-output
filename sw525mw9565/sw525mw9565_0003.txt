The amount of clot was estimated in terms of its
protein content as measured by the method of Lowry (1951)
after dissolving the clot in 2% Naco, in O.1N NaoH.

slect of calcium ion on clot formation
To a one ml. sample of diluted blood containing
2TA was added an additional ml. of 3% Nagl, plus one
ml. of a solution of calcium chloride of molarities
ranging from 0.00625M to O.5M. Samples were allowed to
stand at room temperature for 6 hours, then centrifuged.
the supernatant removed, and the clot washed twice
in a 3% Nacl solution.. The clot was then dissolved
in 5 ml. of a 2% Naco, in O.lN NaoH solution and one
mi. aliquots were removed for protein analysis.
Fig. 1. presents the results. Even without the
addition of calcium chloride, a small amount of par-
ticulate protein was formed. This small amount remained
constant until the solution of calcium chloride added
exceeded 0.025M. The addition of levels in excess of
this amount induced clot formation.

To a one ml. sample of diluted blood containing
EDTA was added one ml. of buffer and one ml. of 0.2M
calcium chloride solution, an amount sufficient to
yield near maximum clot. The procedure follows exactly
the protocol used for calcium dependency above.

of a 0.2M calcium chloride solution to induce clot
formation. Between pH 2.0 and 4.5 the amount of
