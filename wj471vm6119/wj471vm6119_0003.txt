ducted studies to determine what the differences are or how the
animal community may change as wrack ages. Therefore, the following
study was initiated in hopes of shedding some light on this subject.
The study was conducted at North Moss Beach (also known as
Asilomar Beach), Monterey County, California. The beach is about
one-half mile in length and is exposed to open ocean except at each
end where rocky outcrops screen much of the incoming surf. This
gradually sloping sandy beach is bordered on the east by small dunes,
on the north by a public road and one of the rocky areas just mentioned,
and on the south by cliffs and rocks. A small freshwater stream is
located within the northern quarter of the beach.
