developed from the results of this study. Although a limited
number of factors are dealt with in the figure, it nevertheless
illustrates how spatial as well as temporal variability may affect
the distribution of wrack macrofauna. The figure shows a section
of a hypothetical beach on which there are nine evenly-spaced
banks of wrack, represented by circles, which are numbered for
reference. The beach is shown progressively at four different
points in time, as indicated by the Roman numerals down the left
side of the figure. The relative moisture content and state of
decay of each wrack bank is indicated by the letters within the
circles, with state of decay represented by lower case letters
and moisture content represented by upper case letters (see key).
At time I, banks 1,2, and 3 are shown to be below the tidal level.
the level of the water being indicated by the jagged horizontal
line. These banks are located low intertidally, whereas banks
4,5, and 6 are located mid intertidally and banks 7,8, and 9 are
at a high intertidal level.
Two types of macrofaunal associations, represented by
horizontal and vertical hatching within the circles, are shown
to be present within the wrack banks. Association #1 (vertical
hatching) is found in wrack banks of dryness C and state of
decay c. Association +2 is found in banks of dryness B and state
of decay a. At time I, association #l is in wrack bank 8 and
association #2 is in wrack bank 6.
Upon studying figure 9 it becomes evident that both spatial
and temporal change occurs on the beach, and therefore, the
location of a wrack bank on the beach will have a great affect on
