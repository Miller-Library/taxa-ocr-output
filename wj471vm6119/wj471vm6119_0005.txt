Samples of wrack were removed from the wrack banks by means of
pruning shears. The volume of samples varied but all included a seg¬
surface
ment extending from the wrackdown to the sand, with samples varying
in both length and width from 10 cm. to 25 cm. After the wrack sample
was bagged, the sand sample was taken by moving the wrack bank aside
and immediately placing a box with one-fourth square meter openings on
the sand such that all animals on the sand surface were trapped within
The sand to a depth of 5 cm. was then dug
the four sides of the box.
out of the box and returned to the laboratory.
Since it was thought that the moisture content of wrack decreases
with residence time on the beach, the moisture content was determined
for each wrack and sand sample. These values could then be used as
relative measures of the age of the wrack banks sampled.
In the
laboratory, after the wet weight had been determined for each sample,
wet and dry weights of small portions of each sand sample and the major
algal species of each wrack sample were determined. Small pieces of
the wettest and the dryest algae, and of each plant part present for
each algal species,were dried collectively for each wrack sample. The
moisture content of the collection was determined and assumed to be
an estimation of the average moisture content of the algae in the wrack.
The macrofauna was then extracted from each sample. Sand samples
were washed through a series of screens with screen openings of succes¬
sively smaller size, the smallest openings being 0.5 mm. Animals in
the wrack samples were extracted using a Tullgren apparatus as described
by Backlund (1945). The samples were left in the apparatus for 24 hours,
after which time, most, if not all, macrofauha had been extracted.
