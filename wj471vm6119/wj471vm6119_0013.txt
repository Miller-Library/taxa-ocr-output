ulation densities of some wrack animals as wrack ages. Assuming
that, to some extent, wrack placed artificially on the beach simu-
lates natural wrack, it appears that gradual species replacements
and gradual changes in species population densities do not take
place in wrack in periods of from three days to four weeks. Rather
sporadic and sudden increases and decreases in populations of species
seem to be the common occurrence. The species involved in these
changes often show correspondance in their appearance or disappearÂ¬
ance. For instance, in the long-term study, the sample of the
second week contained significantly higher populations of Cercyon
fimbriatus and Tarphiota geniculata than did the sample of the
first week. This may suggest the existence of an association
between these two species. Possibly the simultaneous increases
in population sizes of the two species merely results from a common
need of wrack of the same moisture content and/or same state of
decay for both species. However, this does not seem to be the case
in all samples for these two species. In the short-term study,
while C. fimbriatus was found in high numbers in the sample of
the second day, the abundance of T. geniculata was not great.
The differences between naturally-occurring wrack and wrack
placed artificially on the beach, as discussed by Backlund (1945)
must be noted. A basic difference is that wrack deposited on the
beach as a result of wave action is compacted by the water while
wrack artificially placed on the beach is loosely packed. The
effect of this is increased aeration and consequent faster drying
of the artificial wrack over that of the natural wrack. Also,
wave action tends to partially bury wrack as it is being deposited
