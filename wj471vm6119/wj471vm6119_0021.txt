more preferable bank. Yet, this bank becomes submerged by the
tides again, and the association is forced to seek out wrack on
another portion of the beach.
As has already been mentioned, flying insects, such as the
many species of Staphylinids that have been found in this study,
would be able to move more quickly to desirable wrack than would
non-flying insects such as the Tenebrionid beetles. This might
explain why such great fluctuations have been found to occur in
over time.
wrack populations of Staphylinids It may also explain why such
insects are found in great numbers on the beach, comparatively,
since they are able to more efficiently utilize wrack as a food
source.
Evidence from this study is in full accord with the
hypothesis proposed. However, sufficient data are not available
to prove the hypothesis as yet. Further study is required if we
are to achieve an understanding of the complex community of wrack
macrofauna, and of wrack itself as a unique biome.
