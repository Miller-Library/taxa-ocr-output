wrack on the beach will have a unique life history. As well.
wrack of different ages and species become mixed, further compliÂ¬
cating the picture (Evans, 1972).
So it becomes evident that
animals living in wrack are subjected to constant change of
their habitat which makes the assessment of any kind of pattern
of succession impossible utilizing the more traditional approaches
such as attempted in this study.
In short, the results of this study suggest strongly that
a complex combination of biotic and abiotic factors operate to
determine the characteristics of a wrack bank. This might
explain why no simple correlation could be found between either
wrack moisture content and the vertical position of the wrack on
the beach or wrack
moisture content and the structure of the
wrack macrofauna community. Furthermore, no clearcut stages of
macrofaunal succession could be elucidated as a result of the
inability to age wrack with respect to its state of decay. How-
ever, the study has shown that there are indeed distinct and
peculiar groupings of species which occur over time, even short
periods of time, suggesting that in some fashion there is a
succession of wrack fauna associated with different stages of
decay and perhaps other secondary environmental factors. Yet,
instead of a situation where the habitat remains permanent in
a spatial sense and changes in character with time, allowing for
a series of different associations to develop over time, we have a
situation where there is both spatial variability and temporal
variability.
