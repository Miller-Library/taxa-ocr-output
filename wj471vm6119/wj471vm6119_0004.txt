Materials and Methods
Only wrack macrofauna were considered in this study. For con¬
venience, these were defined as all organisms larger than 0.5 mm. (in
any dimension).
Three types of sampling were attempted: random sampling of
four-week
naturally occurring wrack; a long-term study involving weekly collec¬
tions of wrack samples experimentally placed on the beach; and a
three-day short-term study involving daily collections of wrack samples
experimentally placed on the beach.
Random sampling
On each of three successive days, April 25-27, five banks of wrack
were chosen at random and samples of both wrack and the sand immediately
beneath the wrack were taken. These were taken progressively from north
to south along the beach and at different intertidal levels. Samples
were characterized as being either in a high intertidal area (+5.5 to
+7.0 ft.) or a mid intertidal area (+4.5 to + 5.5 ft.). No samples of
wrack were taken in the surf zone and the lower intertidal areas (below
+4.5 ft.) since preliminary observations indicated that few, if any,
organisms inhabited wrack located there.
Prior to taking samples, the following data were determined and
recorded: date and time of day; air temperature (approximately 3 ft.
above the sand); wrack surface temperature; temperature 5 cm. down in
wrack and 5 cm. down in sand under wrack; dimensions of the wrack
bank; location of wrack in the intertidal zone; the algal species
composing the wrack and their per cent composition by volume. The last
figure was determined merely by visual estimation.
