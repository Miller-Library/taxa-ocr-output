Discussion
The results of the random sampling program suggest very strongly
that there is no clear relationship between wrack moisture content
and the species composition and abundance of wrack macrofauna. It
has been impossible to show any relationship between wrack moisture
content and wrack age, therefore no conclusions can be made regarding
macrofaunal succession in aging wrack from the results of this aspect
of the study
One factor that seems to be important in determining the abun-
dance of wrack macrofauna is the location of the wrack on the beach.
Figure 8 shows the correlation of total species abundance in wrack
samples with the approximate location of the sample longitudinally
along the beach. It can be seen that species abundance is very low
at the north end of the beach but increases greatly as one moves
south, and most especially in samples taken just south of the fresh-
water stream. There are many possible reasons for this phenomenon.
For instance, the rocky outcrop at the north end of the beach appears
to prevent wrack from being deposited on the north quarter of the
beach in as great amounts as it is deposited in the sampling area
south of the stream. Since it is possible that most wrack animals
aggregate where the food is in most abundant supply we might expect
the distribution seen in figure 8. In addition however, the presence
of the road and the fact that the north quarter of the beach is more
frequented by people could both be factors that might affect the
presence of wrack animals there.
It has been shown that in both the long-term and the short-
term sampling experiments great fluctuations take place in the pop-
