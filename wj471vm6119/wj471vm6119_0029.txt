abundance for each wrack sample indicated directly beneath
temperature data for each sample on upper graph. See fig. 1 for
scale of abundance.
Figure 5. Height and volume of wrack banks sampled in relation
to moisture content. Moisture content of sampled wrack indicated
(in %) by number under each illustration. Illustrations arranged
from left to right, top to bottom in order of increasing moisture
content. Height of each wrack bank indicated by vertical scale.
Area occupied by each illustration is relative indication of
volume occupied by wrack bank. Illustrations with diagonal
hatching indicate wrack banks sampled at high intertidal level.
Figure 6. Concentrations of dominant species for each weekly
wrack sample in long-term study. Species indicated by number
on horizontal axis according to key. Concentration (in number
of individuals per kilogram wrack, wet weight) indicated on
vertical axis. Note that two scales are used on vertical axis.
Values above 10 on right scale are shown by broken bar, with
value at top of bar.
Figure 7. Concentrations of dominant species for each daily
wrack sample in short-term study. Species indicated by number
on horizontal axis according to key. Concentration (in number
of individuals per kilogram wrack, wet weight) indicated on
vertical axis
Figure 8. Map of North Moss Beach and location of sampling areas,
with abundance of macrofauna for each random wrack sample indicated
directly beneath approximate location of wrack bank sampled.
