further decreasing its aeration.
Naturally-occurring wrack is possibly subjected to partial
decomposition in the sea before being deposited on the shore, whereas
in the short-term study, Macrocystis was cut from living plants,
and had not begun to decompose prior to its placement on the beach.
This difference may result in a slower inhabitation rate in the
artificial wrack for those animals that utilize wrack only after
a certain stage of decay has been reached.
In both the short-term and the long-term studies, fresh
Macrocystis was placed very high intertidally on dry sand. It is
obvious that this situation never occurs naturally. Such a good
source of food and moisture at that location on the beach is, indeed,
a very attractive commodity to animals living there. This might
explain why, especially in the short-term experiments, unusually
high numbers of animals were found in the wrack.
A very important difference between natural and artificial
wrack in this study is that the artificial wrack was staked down
and was not moved around by surf or wave action. Natural wrack
may be moved from place to place on the beach and as well, from
zone
subtidal to intertidal zone and back, many times during its life
history.
It seems probable then that the animal community in artificial
wrack will not develop and change in precisely the same manner as
will that of the natural wrack. However, the results obtained in
the studies involving artificial wrack may indicate trends which
help to explain the uneven distribution and abundance of species
among natural wrack banks.
