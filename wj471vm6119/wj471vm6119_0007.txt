Oshort-term study
Three ten-pound samples of fresh Macrocystis integrifolia (cut
from the kelp beds off Hopkins Marine Station) were staked out parallel
with the water's edge at a high intertidal location (approximately+6.5
ft.). The banks were approximately 30 feet apart. On each of the
next three succeeding days, one bank was collected, as was a sample of
the sand under it. Determination of moisture content and animal extracÂ¬
tion procedures were the same as described earlier.
