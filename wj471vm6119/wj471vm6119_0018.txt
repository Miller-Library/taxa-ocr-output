the way that it develops. The rate of decay and moisture loss in
wrack is influenced by a number of factors. For instance, the
state of decay of wrack when it is deposited will probably affect
both its rate of decay and its rate of moisture loss on the beach.
The size of the wrack bank, of course, will greatly affect both
decay rate and rate of moisture loss. The vertical location of
the wrack on the beach will determine how often the wrack will be
washed by the tides and the length of tiime it will remain on the
beach. To illustrate the importance of some of these factors, we
can discuss one of the hypothetical wrack banks in figure 9. At
time I in the figure, wrack bank 1 has, of course, a high moisture
content, since it is below the tide level. Its state of decay is
b. It becomes deposited on the beach at time II, but no change
is immediately seen in moisture content. Perhaps the bank is quite
large or possibly it has become partially covered with sand. Both
of these factors would probably greatly influence rate of moisture
loss. No change is seen in the state of decay of wrack bank 1
immediately after deposition. In this case, the size of the bank,
its algal species composition, and/or its state of decay at the
time of deposition may be the influencing factors. The bank
starts to dry out and its moisture content becomes B at time III,
but still no change is seen in its state of decay. This would be
understandable if the wrack were composed of fresh algae which
would probably have a slow initial decay rate due to its short
amount of time of exposure to bacterial decomposition. At time
IV, the state of decay of wrack bank 1 has proceeded to c, but
now the bank is again below the tide level and so its moisture
