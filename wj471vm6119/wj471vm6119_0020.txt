quickly from one wrack bank to another. In particular, insects
appear to be especially pre-adapted to this type of life. They
are often able to detect the presence of very small quantities
of compounds over some distance and use this ability to find an
appropriate place in which to live. Bark beetles, for example,
are well known for such abilitiese
Another
excellent example of this is the ability of many male insects
to detect the presence of minute quantities of pheromones emitted
virtually miles away by females of their species. It seems
possible then, that wrack animals might be able to determine the
state of decay of wrack by detecting small amounts of compounds
given off into the air as a result of decomposition. Flying
wrack insects especially would be at an advantage since they would
be able to move quickly to the most desirable wrack. These ideas
are illustrated in figure 9. Association 1 is found only in old,
dry wrack. When wrack bank 8 becomes buried at time II, association
fl is forced to seek out another old, dry wrack bank. The entire
association then moves to wrack bank 4. As other wrack ages, more
old, dry wrack becomes available, and the association utilizes
this as well (wrack bank 9, in this case). So in this example, the
association benefits by being able to quickly find old, dry wrack
when forced to, and by being able to utilize all sources of old,
dry wrack available on a stretch of beach.
Association +2 in figure 9 is found in moist, new wrack. At
times I and II then, it is in wrack bank 6. However, as this bank
ages and another bank of moist, new wrack becomes available as a
result of wave and tidal action, the association moves to the
