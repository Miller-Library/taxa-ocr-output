Abstract
Wrack macrofauna on North Moss Beach, Monterey County,
California, were studied in an attempt to determine if a faunal
succession occurs in aging wrack. Samples of naturally occurÂ¬

relative age of wrack by determining its moisture content,
assuming that wrack loses moisture gradually and steadily as it
ages. However, wrack at different stages of decay can have the
same moisture content. Therefore, no definite conclusions could
be made in regard to succession in naturally occurring wrack.
Yet, it was found that among wrack banks seemingly in the same
general state of decay, great variation in species composition
and species abundance may take place. This was also demonstrated
in samples of artificial wrack over both short and long periods
of time. The evidence suggests that typical terrestrial succession

composition and species population sizes seem to be the rule.
In an attempt to explain more clearly how such changes in the
community of wrack macrofauna may take place with time, an
hypothesis has been formulated which takes into account the
spatial and temporal variability in the state of beach wrack and
the mechanism by which typical wrack fauna may respond relative
to possible pre-adaptations to similar kinds of environmental
situations.
