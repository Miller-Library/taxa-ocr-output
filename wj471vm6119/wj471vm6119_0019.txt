Other wrack banks in figure 9 could be discussed and
explanations for change, or lack of change, could be proposed.
For instance, a number of factors might cause a wrack bank like 5
to remain static over time or a bank like 9 to decay rapidly. The
point to be made is that there are a complex number of ways that
wrack banks can change over time because of the great number of
factors influencing them.
Now, how do wrack organisms cope with such irregular and
extreme changes in wrack? Many typical marine or maritime organÂ¬
isms live in the sand and move with the tide. Such organisms
utilize wrack primarily as a food source and only occaisonally
as a source of shelter and moisture. However, it would seem that
typical wrack animals, since they depend upon wrack not only as
a source of food but as their only source of shelter and moisture,
would be highly adapted to finding wrack containing the appropriate
constellation of factors necessary for the species involved. As
well, because of the limited amount of wrack that is available on
most beaches, the competition for niche space among wrack animals
would be high, and any specialization would be advantageous to
these animals. Such specialization might result in different
wrack animals utilizing wrack at different stages of decay and
moisture content. Because wrack banks are continually changing
in this regard, and because they are subjected to other changes
such as inundation as result of tidal action, it would seem that
wrack organisms would benefit greatly if they were able to detect
the state of decay and moisture content of wrack and to move
