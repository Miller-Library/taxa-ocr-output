Figure 1. Relative abundance of macrofauna in each random wrack
sample in relation to wrack moisture content. Moisture content
of sample wrack increases in samples from left to right along
horizontal axis. Corresponding relative abundance indicated on
vertical axis. Scale: 1= macrofauna least abundant; 6= macro-
fauna most abundant.
Figure 2. Relative abundance of predominant animal species in
random wrack samples in relation to wrack moisture content.
Species from left to right, top to bottom are: Orchestoidea
benedicti, Orchestoidea californiana, Cafius canescens, Cercyon
fimbriatus, Pontamalota californica, Leptocera johnsoni. Moisture
content indicated on horizontal axis.
Relative abundance
indicated on vertical axis. Scale: 1= scarce; 2= common; 3-
abundant; 4= very abundant.
Figure 3. Algal species composition of wrack sampled in relation
to abundance of wrack macrofauna. Abundance of macrofauna in
sample wrack increases in samples from left to right along hori-
zontal axis. Per cent composition of each algal species for each
sample indicated on vertical axis according to key.
Figure 4. Comparison of temperature data for each sample with
relative abundance of macrofauna in random wrack samples. Upper
graph shows temperature data for wrack and sand samples according
to key. Odd sample numbers are wrack samples; even sample numbers
are sand samples. Lower graph shows corresponding relative
abundance of macrofauna for each random wrack sample, with
