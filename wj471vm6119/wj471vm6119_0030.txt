at lower left of figure. Relative abundance of macrofauna for
each sample indicated directly beneath approximate location of
wrack bank sampled. See figure 2 for scale of abundance.
Figure 9. Temporal and spatial change on a hypothetical beach
and its possible affect on wrack banks and their macrofauna.
Each
box represents same section of beach at four points in time.
Circles represent nine hypothetical wrack banks (numbered for
reference). Top three circles in each box represent wrack
located low intertidally; middle three represent wrack located
mid intertidally; bottom three represent wrack located high
intertidally. Tidal level indicated by jagged horizontal line.
Moisture content of each bank over time indicated by upper case
letters according to key. State of decay of each bank indicated
by lower case letters according to key. Two macrofaunal associa-
tions represented by horizontal and vertical hatching according to
key. Movement of associations among wrack banks through time
indicated by arrows.
