It should be noted that in this study, data for all Dipterans and
Diptera larvae are not as quantitatively accurate as the other data.
This is especially true for adult flies, since the sampling procedures
were not sufficient to allow for the quantitative capture of flies.
Hence, only flies that were residing deep within the wrack were caught.
Higher numbers of the Dipteran species Leptocera johnsoni were caught
than other species, probably because this species tends to inhabit
the deeper layers of the wrack (Hyatt, 1972).
Many of the animals found in the sand samples actually had fallen
out of the wrack when it was picked up. It can be assumed then, that
many of the animals found in the sand samples actually were in the
wrack at the time of sampling. This was a problem especially in the
short-term study because the samples had not greatly diminished in
volume as a result of moisture loss as previous samples had, and they
were therefore, more difficult to collect. Many more animals were
able to escape from the wrack because of the longer time required to
bag the samples.
Many small larvae were probably overlooked because they could not
easily be detected in the detritus and small amounts of sand that were
mixed in with animals during extraction procedures. Also because of
this fact, the unidentified egg cases found in some samples may have
been overlooked in other samples. These egg cases were small and were
coated with sand grains, making them very difficult to detect when
mixed with sand.
