Random sampling
The moisture content of sample wrack and the relative abundance
of each species found associated with it is given in table 1. The same
type of data for sand samples is given in table 2.
In figure 1, the wrack samples are arranged in order of increasing
moisture content and the total abundance of animals for each sample is
indicated. This figure shows that there is no direct relationship
between wrack moisture content and abundance of macrofauna in wrack.
For each dominant species, the abundance is plotted against wrack
This figure again
moisture content for wrack samples in figure 2.
shows that a relationship between wrack moisture content and individual
species abundance does not seem to exist. In all cases, there is
considerable variation in abundance as wrack moisture content increases.
In order to determine if the algal species composition of wrack is
important in determining the distribution of wrack fauna, the
species composition of each wrack pile sampled is indicated and the
samples are arranged in order of increasing total abundance of animals
in figure 3. It is evident from this figure that the distribution of
wrack fauna is not directly related to the species composition of the
wrack.
Temperature data are plotted in order of sample number in figure
4. Directly beneath this graph, the total animal species abundance
is indicated for each sample. It does not appear as if a close
relationship exists between temperature and the presence or absence
of wrack macrofauna.
In figure 5, each bank of wrack sampled is diagrammatically
