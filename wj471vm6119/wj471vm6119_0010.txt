shown. These are arranged in order of increasing moisture content
and the outlined area representing each wrack bank is a relative
indication of the volume occupied by the wrack as seen on the beach.
By comparing the high intertidal samples with the others, it becomes
evident that wrack moisture content does not seem to depend on the
location of the wrack on the beach. Therefore, since old wrack
located high on the beach may have a moisture content comparable to
newer wrack located low on the beach, it is not possible to use
moisture content as an indicator of age.
Long-term study
In figure 6, the concentrations of the dominant species in each
weekly wrack sample are indicated. For the first sample, the species
are arranged in order of decreasing concentration, and the same order
of species is followed in the remaining three samples. Weekly fluctu¬
ations took place in almost every species, some of which were very
great. The greatest abundance of animals occurred in the sample of
the second week, but decreases followed in the remaining two weeks.
Loss in moisture content from the fresh Macrocystis integrifolia
during the four weeks of the experiment was considerable. Water con¬
tent decreased from 89.6% at the beginning of the experiment, to a
value of 47.4% in the fourth sample.
Short-term study
Figure 7 shows the concentrations of the dominant species in
each daily wrack sample. The arrangement is the same as in figure
6. A surprisingly large number of species were found in the wrack
samples, even after only one day on the beach. As in the case of the
long-term study, great fluctuations in population densities took place
