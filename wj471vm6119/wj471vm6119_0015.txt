Insects have been found in this study to be the most well-
represented class of animals inhabiting wrack and, as Backlund (1945)
notes, "...most insects are usually spread to wrack...by active
flight." Backlund also tells of seeing swarms of beetles flying
around the beach at night. Possibly entire swarms may converge on
a wrack bank. If this does occur, it might explain the great
fluctuations in numbers of animals, especially beetles, that have
been found to take place in wrack fauna over time. A particular
swarm may be attracted to a specific bank for any number, and
possibly a combination, of reasons. A few factors that may be
important are (1) wrack moisture content and its state of decay,
(2) wrack odor, (3) other organisms already present in the wrack,
temperature of the wrack,
(4
and (5) the location of the wrack on the beach. Possibly the
presence on a bank of a female emitting a pheromone would attract
entire swarms of males. Furthermore, a species may be attracted
to a bank for only a very short period of time.
This might
account for the great fluctuations in numbers of some insects that
were found to occur in the artificial wrack banks even over short
time periods.
Still another factor must be considered when trying to explain
the seemingly random distribution of wrack animals, that factor
being the life history of the wrack itself. After wrack becomes
deposited on the beach, basically one of three things will happen
to it: (1) It may be washed out to sea again; (2) It may be moved
from one part of the beach to another by the surf; (3) It may be
covered by sand. In all wrack, these changes probably take place
numerous times and in varying ways such that each individual bank of
