Introduction
The sandy beach, though virtually devoid of visible vegetation,
supports a fairly diverse animal community (Backlund, 1945). As Back-
lund (1945) has shown, wrack, i.e. detached marine algae deposited on
the beach, provides food, moisture, and shelter for many members of
this community. Yet, because of tidal variations, the residence time
of wrack on sandy beaches varies considerably (Backlund, 1945 and Evans,
1972). For instance, very high tides such as the extreme spring tides
that occur each year, may deposit wrack so high on a gradually sloping
beach that it remains there for months or even years. In contrast,
daily tides may result in a dynamic process whereby, lower on the beach,
the deposition and removal of wrack occurs on successive high tides.
The animal community inhabiting wrack is subjected to a wide variety
of changes, two of the most important being the continuous moisture
loss from, and bacterial decomposition of, the wrack itself (Backlund,
1945). These changes should have a profound effect on the wrack fauna
for, as Backlund has found, "Every schizophagous species can only utilize
dead organic matter which has a special degree of moistness, and usually
also quite a special degree of decaying."
Therefore, it seems probable
that gradual changes might occur in faunal species composition and
population densities as wrack ages on the beach. It is quite possible
that a distinct series of different associations occur in wrack as it
progresses through successive stages of drying and decay. The system
envisioned would then somewhat resemble typical terrestrial succession
as is known to occur in other biomes.
Though Backlund and Remmert (1964) acknowledge that there is a
difference between the fauna of fresh and old wrack, neither has conÂ¬
