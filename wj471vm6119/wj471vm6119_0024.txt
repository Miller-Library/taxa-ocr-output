I especially wish to thank Dr. Welton Lee of Hopkins
Marine Station for his invaluable suggestions and undying
patience. A more devoted teacher probably cannot be found.
My thanks go also to Dr. I.M. Newell and Ian Moore of
the University of California who identified the Coleopterans
found in this study. Also helping with identification were
Sam Johnson, Joel Hyatt, and Helen Kompfner, as well as Dr.
Lee, all of Hopkins Marine Station. Their help was greatly
appreciated.
Special thanks go to Delane Munson, also of Hopkins
Marine Station.
