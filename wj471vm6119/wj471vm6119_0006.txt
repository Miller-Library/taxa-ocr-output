Long-term study
The second aspect of the study involved placing approximately tenÂ¬
pound samples of fresh Macrocystis integrifolia.(acquired from the surf
zone) on the beach. Three rows of five samples per row were layed out,
each row being parallel with the water's edge. The rows were
placed approximately 30 feet apart at three successive levels, the
highest level being at the foot of the sand dunes (approximately +6.5
ft.). Initially, an 18 inch stake was driven well into the sand in
the center of each pile. The following day, it was found that six of
the samples had been washed away, so in an attempt to prevent this
from happening with the remaining samples, the others were wrapped
with wire and attached to the stake,
The purpose of this part of the study was to determine macrofaunal
changes that occur within wrack at different levels on the beach over a
relatively long time period. It was intended that one sample per week
from each row would be collected. However, all samples except four at
the highest level were washed away within one week. As a result, it
was possible only to study changes that occur over four weeks at a very
high intertidal level (approximately +6.5 ft.). These samples were
collected and processed in the same manner as described earlier, with
the exception that the entire bank of wrack was collected and processed,
It should be noted that all these samples had been washed by surf and
were almost completely covered by sand at the time they were ultimately
collected. Therefore, a considerable amount of sand was collected with
the wrack. The sand that was mixed with the wrack was sifted and the
animals obtained were recorded as being in the wrack itself.
