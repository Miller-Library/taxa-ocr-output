ABSTRACT
Using immunoblotting and enhanced chemiluminescence
techniques, heat shock proteins of molecular weight 60 KD and 70KD
were identified constitutively in Tigriopus californicus under
control conditions of 19 degrees Celsius. Hsp 60 was induced
during separate experiments under conditions of increased
temperature and increased salinity concentrations. Western
analysis could not definitively identify induction of hsp 70 during
heat shock or salinity shock. This study serves as the basis for
further study of heat shock proteins in marine organisms.
