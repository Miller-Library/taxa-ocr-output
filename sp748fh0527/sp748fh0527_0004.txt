was chosen as the test organism for this nine week project because
it is relatively abundant in the tide pools near Hopkins Marine
Station and is easily maintained in the lab at room temperature.
Materials and Methods
Collecting Tigriopus californicus. Copepods were collected
through a small collecting strainer from two high splash pools near
Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey Bay, California. They were
maintained in filtered sea water at room temperature and fed ground
mussel approximately every twenty four hours.
Obtaining protein. Protein samples were obtained by
homogenization of Tigriopus californicus in homogenization buffer
containing 10 ml PBS in 10 mM EDTA, 50uI PMSF, 10ul pepstatin,
1Oul leupeptin, 100ul chymostatin and 50ul ofNP-40 (.5%).
Following centrifugation, supernatant from the sample was boiled
for three minutes and protein content was determined using
Coomassie stain reagent.'
SDS PAGE. Solubilized protein from the sample was separated
according to molecular weight by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS
acrylamide gel. Prestained molecular weight standards were
obtained from Sigma Chemical Corporation (St. Louis, MO.). The hsp
60kD standard was obtained from mouse protein and made available
to the lab by Ildiko Kovacs at Hopkins Marine Station. The hsp 70KD
bovine brain stress protein standard was supplied by StressGen
Biotechnologies Corporation (Victoria, B.C.).
