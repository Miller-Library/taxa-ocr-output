Introduction
All organisms possess mechanisms enabling them to endure or
adapt to the common stresses of their environments. In the marine
environment, common stresses may include variable temperatures,
introduction of pollutants, or changes in pH. There are a variety of
ways organisms may cope with stress. At the cellular level, one of
the most important reactions to stress may be the increased
synthesis of additional proteins commonly referred to as heat shock
proteins or hsps√©. The increased production of these groups of
proteins in response to stress is commonly referred to as the heat
shock response5. In addition to playing a vital role in normal cell
activities, hsps protect the cells from the damaging effects of
extreme temperature changes or other environmental stress4 . Heat
shock proteins are among the most highly conserved genetic system
known, indicating that they may play an important biological role in
the adaptation and evolution of organisms5. Although heat shock
response has been studied in fruit flies, yeast, chickens, mammals
and bacteria, it has not been rigorously evaluated in marine
organisms, many of which live in highly variable habitats associated
with the periodicity of the tides.
Tigriopus californicus is a marine copepod that thrives in the
high splash pools associated with rocky coastlines. This hearty
crustacean ranges from the coast of Glacier Bay, Alaska, south to
Baja California2. This study identifies two groups of heat shock
proteins in Tigriopus and attempts to observe increased production
of the hsps in response to changes in temperature and salinity
simulating harsher environmental conditions. Tigriopus californicus
