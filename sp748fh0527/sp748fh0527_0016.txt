Acknowledgements
wish to extend thanks to Dr. R. P. Levine for his immense
enthusiasm and dedicated interest in this project. I would also like
to thank Julie Golden for her incredible patience in teaching me the
necessary technical skills of gel electrophoresis and western
blotting. Additional thanks are extended to everyone who worked in
Dr. Levine's lab for sharing precious lab space with me and providing
an enjoyable work environment! And finally, greatful thanks are
offered to the entire staff at Hopkins Marine Station and the other
students participating in the spring program, for their help and
encouragement.
