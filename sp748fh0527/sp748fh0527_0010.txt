Figure 1. Film developed for one minute after enhanced
chemiluminescence following standard western blot procedure
showing identification of hsp 60 family in T. californicus
acclimated at 19 degrees and 100% sea water. A 10ul sample of
mouse standard is loaded in the far right lane (lane 4) and increasing
amounts of sample protein are loaded in lanes 1 through 3,
respectively. A prestained molecular weight sample was loaded in
lane 5, not shown in the figure.
Figure 2. Film developed for five minutes after western blotting
and enhanced chemiluminescence using anti-hsp 70 antibody 3A3.
Sample protein from organisms acclimated at 19 degrees was loaded
in lanes 1 through 3 and 10ul of hsp 70 standard extracted from
bovine brain (StressGen Technologies Corp.) was loaded in lane 4
Figure 3. Film developed after enhanced chemiluminescence of
protein obtained from T. californicus under control conditions and
under heat shock conditions of 30 degrees Celsius. Control protein
is loaded in increasing amounts in lanes 1 through 4. Heat shocked
protein is loaded in lanes 6 through 10, and the hsp60 standard is
located in lane 5. Equal amounts of protein are loaded in lanes 1 and
6, lanes 2 and 7, lanes 3 and 8, and lanes 4 and 9.
Figure 4. Film developed after western blotting and enhanced
chemiluminescence of protein extracted from T. californicus
acclimated at 50% artificial sea water (lane 2), and transferred to
100% and 200% artificial sea water (lanes 3 and 4 respectively).
Hsp 60 standard is located in lane 1.
Figure 5. Results of the salinity shock experiment probing for
hsp70. Lane 1 contains the hsp70 standard. Lanes 2 contains the
control condition of acclimation at 50% artificial sea water. Lanes
3 and 4 contain protein extracted from copepods transferred to 100%
and 200% artificial sea water.
