Western Blotting. The western blotting procedure was carried out
according to the protocol described by Harlow and Lanes. The
primary heat shock monoclonal anti-body used for detecting heat
shock proteins of the 60kD family was obtained from StressGen
Biotechnologies Corp. Anti-hsp70 monoclonal antibody 3A3 was
made available to the lab by Shawn Murphy at Northwestern
University. The anti-GOKD antibody was diluted 1:1000. All other
anti-bodies, including the secondary antibodies, were diluted
1:10000. Secondary anti-rabbit lgG peroxidase conjugate and antiÂ¬
mouse lgG peroxidase conjugate were supplied by Sigma Immuno
Chemicals.
Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL). Films of the nitrocellulose
membrane were developed in the dark room using Kodak film
according to the protocol for ECL immunodetection supplied by
Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, England).
Heat and Salinity Shock Experiments.
Protein samples used to
detect induced hsps after exposure to heat shock were obtained from
individuals acclimated to 19 degree sea water for twenty-four hours
and then transferred to 32 degree Celsius sea water for a period of
four hours. Similarly, copepods were acclimated at 50% artificial
sea water for twenty-four hours and transferred to 100% or 200%
artificial sea water to test for salinity shock. All salinity shock
experiments were conducted at 19 degrees Celsius.
