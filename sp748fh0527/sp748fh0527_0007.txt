Celsius were run in lanes 1,2, 3 and 4. Lanes 6 through 10 contain
increasing amounts of protein from copepods acclimated for
twenty-four hours at 19 degrees and then transferred to 30 degrees
Celsius for 3 hours. Equal amounts of protein are loaded in lanes 1
and 6, lanes 2 and 7, lanes 3 and 8, and lanes 4 and 9. The presence
of induced hsp 60 is indicated by the multiple bands visible in the
sample lanes 6 through 10 as compared to the corresponding control
lanes 1 through 4 containing equal protein.
Exposing Tigriopus californicus to salinities of 100% and 200%
for four hours after 24-hour acclimation at 50% instant ocean
induced production of hsp 60 (figure 4) but did not induce production
of hsp 70 (figure 5). In each figure, lane 2 is the control, containing
protein obtained from animals acclimated at 50% instant ocean and
lanes 3 and 4 contain protein of Tigriopus californicus exposed to
the increased salinity concentrations of 100% and 200%,
respectively. Figure 4 displays an overloaded gel which nonetheless
shows multiple bands in the sample lanes 2 (50%), 3 (100%), and 4
(200%) as compared to the standard loaded in lane 1. Although the
copepods were acclimated at 50% artificial sea water, multiple
bands are present in lane 2, perhaps indicating that they had not yet
adapted to the change. Figure 5 shows only single bands in the three
samples loaded in lanes 2, 3, and 4, from which definitive results
cannot be discussed.
Conclusions
Heat shock proteins of the 60kD and 70kD molecular weight
families were identified in samples of protein from Tigriopus
