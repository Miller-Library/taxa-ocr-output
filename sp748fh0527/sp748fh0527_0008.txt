californicus under optimal conditions of 19 degrees Celsius and
100% sea water. These constitutive proteins may enable the
organisms to endure normal ranges of stress introduced by small
changes in their habitat. Identification of these proteins verifies
that cross reaction with the anti-hsp antibodies has occured.
Inducible forms of hsp 60 found under both heat shock and
salinity shock may enhance the survival rate of Tigriopus
californicus for several hours or longer during an increase in
temperature of 13 degrees Celsius and increased salinity

production of proteins enabling survival under harsh conditions
is an
important component of this species' ability to live in the high
splash pools. This study is only an initial investigation of heat
shock proteins in marine organisms and provides the basis for
correlating successful survival of organisms with heat shock
protein synthesis and activity.
