Instead, in the brain a stimulus (such as glutamate) acting at NMDA receptors triggers
calcium. Calcium binds to calmodulin, thereby activating NOS. This mode of activation
explains the ability of glutamate neurotransmission to stimulate NO formation in a matter
of seconds.
The discovery of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter has radically altered our
thinking about synaptic transmission. Being a labile, free radical gas (though in most
biological situations NO is in solution), NO is not stored in synaptic vesicles. Instead it is
synthesized as needed by NO synthase (NOS) from its precursor L-arginine. Rather than
exocytosis, NO simply diffuses from nerve terminals. It does not react with receptors but
diffuses into adjacent cells. In place of reversible interactions with targets, NO forms
covalent linkages to a multiplicity of targets that may be enzymes, such as guanylyl
cyclase (GC) or other protein or nonprotein targets. Inactivation of NO presumably
involves diffusion away from targets as well as covalent linkages to an assortment of
small or large molecules such as superoxide and diverse proteins (Snyder 2001).
Soluble GC is known as a major target protein for NO in the central nervous
system. NO activates sGC and promotes the increase in intracellular cGMP level by
binding to the heme moiety with high affinity. Soluble GC and cGMP were thought to be
involved in the second messenger pathway for NO action in the MCC because a previous
study showed that the EPSP was partially suppressed by methylene blue, a nonspecific
GC inhibitor (Jacklet and Gruhn 1994). The depolarization resulting from sodium
nitroprusside treatment is consistent with the idea that they cause closure of potassium
channels, and the membrane potential shifts away from the potassium equilibrium
potential, in the depolarizing direction, as a result. The depolarization and decrease in
