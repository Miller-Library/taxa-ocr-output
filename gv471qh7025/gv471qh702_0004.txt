Initially, T had hoped to make pre-synaptic intracellular recordings from C2, a
small cell in the cerebral ganglion, and post-synaptic intracellular recordings from MCC.
the metacerebral cell, its follower in the same ganglion. However, the position of C2
within different specimens of Aplysia is extremely variable, and identification of the
correct cell was difficult. I shifted gears, and looked to see if NO released from an
exogenous NO-donor compound like sodium nitroprusside would mimic the membrane
depolarization and increase in input resistance that are characteristic of the EPSP that
occurs in the MCC during stimulation of NOS-containing neuron C2 (Jacklet 1999).
Sodium nitroprusside induced membrane depolarization and an increase in input
resistance.
Action potentials were fired about once every two seconds in the MCC before
