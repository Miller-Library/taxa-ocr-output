by a current pulse. The EPSP in the MCC was evoked by stimulating the cell with a 2
second current pulse injection, resulting in a train of action potential spikes. The firing
frequency of MCC during stimulation was moderately stable most of the time. Because
of the tendency to facilitate, the EPSPs were measured with at least 15 sec breaks for
recovery to the normal state before subsequent stimulation.
