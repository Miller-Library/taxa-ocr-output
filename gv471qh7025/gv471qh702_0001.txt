Abstract:
Nitric oxide (NO) is an unconventional neurotransmitter. It is not stored in
vesicles and released by exocytosis. Rather, it is produced from arginine by the
activation of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO
acts as an orthograde neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, which means that it
is released by pre-synaptic cells and affects post-synaptic cells. This unusual molecule
stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase and increases intracellular levels of cGMP in the
post-synaptic cell. I wondered if an exogenous NO donor like sodium nitroprusside
would result in post-synaptic membrane depolarization and increased input resistance in
cells thought to receive this type of input. Using microelectrode techniques, I measured
resting potentials and action potentials in the MCC (metacerebral cell) in the cerebral
ganglion of Aplysia californica. I found that sodium nitroprusside caused a subthreshold
membrane depolarization and increase in input resistance. The literature suggests that
these effects may be the result of NÃ– donors acting on potassium channels in the post-
synaptic membrane. These experiments support the idea that NO acts as a transmitter or
as a neuromodulator to influence the excitability of post-synaptic neurons in Aplysia.
