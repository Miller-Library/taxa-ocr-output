Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is an unconventional neurotransmitter because it is not stored in
vesicles and released by exocytosis. Rather, it is produced from arginine by the
activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS).
NO acts as an orthograde neurotransmitter in the central nervous system by stimulating
guanylyl cyclase and increasing intracellular cGMP in the post-synaptic cell. The cGMP
increase stimulated by NO appears to alter one or more of the membrane ionic currents
that are required for spike/burst activity (Koh and Jacklet 2001). Several experiments
indicate that the potassium current may be strongly affected by NO.
Materials and methods
Animals and chemicals. Aplysia californica (100-150 g) were supplied by a company in
Florida that is associated with Eric Kandel's lab. The Aplysia were kept in an aquarium
tank at 16-20 degrees Celsius, and fed fresh seaweed from Agassiz Beach. Sodium
nitroprusside (420-003-M005, Alexis Corporation, San Diego, CA) solution (1 mM) was
made by dissolving .0002 g sodium nitroprusside in 1 mL of fresh seawater. The solution
was used immediately after mixing.
Electrophysiology. Isolated cerebral ganglia were incubated in fresh seawater before
desheathing at room temperature. A desheathed ganglion was pinned down on a sylgard
dish (1 inch in diameter) and superfused with seawater to measure the subthreshold
membrane depolarization and increase in input resistance of the MCC in response to
sodium nitroprusside. Intracellular recording electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl.
Membrane depolarizations were recorded immediately after the end of the sodium
nitroprusside superfusion. Input resistance was measured as the voltage deflection caused
