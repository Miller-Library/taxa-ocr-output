membrane conductance suggest that potassium channels are closed. NO depolarizes the
MCC by reducing a resting membrane potassium conductance, and this effect is
mimicked by sodium nitroprusside.
These results seem contradictory because an increase in depolarization should not
theoretically be found with an increase in input resistance, but NO seems to have a
variety of actions on membrane ion channels. Neurotransmission in general is surely
many times more complex than we have the understanding for right now.
Conclusion
Numerous mammalian studies strongly implicate NO in learning, especially LTP
and LTD. A recent study provides strong evidence of NO's involvement in the formation
of olfactory memories in sheep (Kendrick et al. 1997) and provides a link to the
conserved olfactory function for NÖ signaling. Ewes learn to recognize the odor of their
lambs within 2 hrs of giving birth. NOS inhibitors block this learning and infusion of NO
by microdialysis reverses the block.
