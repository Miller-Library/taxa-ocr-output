application of sodium nitroprusside. Depolarizing current applied for 2 seconds resulted
in a train of action potentials, separated by 50 ms. Immediately following the NO donor
superfusion, the same amount of depolarizing current was applied and EPSPs. I interpret
this as an increase in input resistance. The cell recovered after sodium nitroprusside
application, firing more than once a second on average.

Discussion
The time scale for nitric oxide’s role in synaptic plasticity is incredibly short. NO
is highly reactive and extremely labile, so its biological half-life is within a range of only
a few seconds, and it is oxidized to stable nitrite and nitrate (Rode 1992). The story of
NO in synaptic transmission is therefore fast-paced. NÖS enzymes can be discriminated
as inducible or constitutive. The brain and endothelial forms are constitutive in that
stimuli for NO formation do not typically result in new enzyme protein synthesis.
