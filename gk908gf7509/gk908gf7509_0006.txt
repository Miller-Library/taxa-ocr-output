Tearse, Tigriopus californicus, Aggressive Behavior
even with gravid females present. Also males attempted the copulating
pair position with females. But, gravid females sucessfully shook off
males grabbing onto her egg sac or attempting to copulate. Copulating pairs
formed of a male and an egg-bearing female were observed in other
populations of Tigriopus californicus.
Greater than 87% of all encounters involved 2 animals (Graph 2).
Tail clasping, counted as an encounter involving 2 animals, comprised 147
of the total encounters.
When the vials were undisturbed for 1 hour, greater than 70% of the
populations, including females, were resting or crawling on the bottom.
DISCUSSION
Encounters are solely a male aggressive trait and have an inverse
(Table 1)
dependence on surface area but not on volume./ General observations
show that Tigriopus is mainly benthic. Hal Townsend (unpublished) has
found that in a nine cm water column under 110 LUX light conditions,
approximately 50% of the active populations of Tigriopus californicus
is within the bottom quarter of the water column.
Decreasing the probability of bumping, a preliminary to an encounter,
has a direct effect of decreasing the probability of encounters.
Increasing the volume does not significantly decrease the amount of
bumping, whereas increasing bottom surface area does. Therefore, to decrease
the number of encounters it is more effective to increase the bottom
(Graph 1)
surface area than to increase the volume./ Since the probability of two
animals bumping is so much greater than three or more at the same time,
