it follows that the frequency of encounters involving two animals is
greater than three or more. (Graph 2)
Males apparently will form copulating pairs with males, not
limiting themselves to females. This indicates that males will
try to form copulating pairs with anything. To the author tail clasping
could be an unsucessful attempt at the copulating pair position. In this
study the maximum of 12 sightings of male-male copulating pairs could
be the same four pairs counted at each scoring. Encounters, since they
terminated within thirty minutes, did not have this scoring problem.
The egg sac-carrying females were very defensive, protecting
their egg sacs and avoiding the copulating pair position. This would
improve the survival chances of the eggs, as well as reduce the time wasted
by a male trying to copulate with a gravid female. In other populations
of Tigriopus, female egg sacs have been eaten while still on the female.
Also, a male copulating with a gravid female is wasting his efforts since
one copulation can result in insemination of up to 12 broods (3).
