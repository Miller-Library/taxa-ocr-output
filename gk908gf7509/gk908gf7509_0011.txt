distal end of this stout structure. There are four sets of palps,
two with three hairy spines; each in line proximal to the claw. The last
two are side by side at the base of the appendage.
The maxilliped consists of a dactylus with one spine at the
distal end of the massive second joint. The setae of the second joint are
bipectinate.
MECHANISM AND FUNCTION
Macrocylops albidis Jurine, a cyclopoid copepod is a related
crustacean whose feeding mechanism has been described (Fryer 1957)
Applying Fryer's interpretation, a general idea of the feeding mechanism
of Tigriopus californicus can be derived.
In describing the appendages, Fryer states
... the most important movements of the appendagea are
those of adduction and abduction... and consist essentially
of a lateral swing through 90Â°. (Fryer, pp. 7-8)
The labrum which usually "hangs" away from the mouth can be brought
up to cover the mouth. The teeth at the terminal end can then help to
hold the food material while other appendages work on it.
The mandible has three types of movements. There is a rocking motion
of both appendages in the horizontal plane. The cutting motion is a
vertical movement with the dentitures of the mandible crossing. And
oscillating alternately increases and decreases the horizontal distance
between the mandibles. The movements are intermittent in nature and
are useful for tearing the food into manageable pieces. The Tigriopus,
as compared to the cyclopoid mandible, seems to have more of a masticating
