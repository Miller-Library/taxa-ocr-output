Aggressive Behavior as a Function of
Density in Tigriopus californicus Baker
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tigriopus californicus were collected from a high tide pool just south
of Mussel Point in Pacific Grove, California. Sexed under a dissecting
scope, males with claspers on their first antennae and females with
egg sacs were used. Animals kept in the laboratory longer than 24 hours
were fed Monochrysis lutherii, a flagellate. Tigriopus japonicus can live
longer than eight generations on Monochrysis lutherii (2) Attempts were
made to simulate the natural crowded conditions in evaporating high tide
pools. To check on the effect of serial dilutions, some animals were
run in sequences of decreasing density, as would occur when the tide
pool fills with splash. Since Tigriopus swims, changes in volume density
were tested. Narrow vials (with 3.1 cm bottom surface area) containing
2ml sea water to which were added 100 males, 100 females and 50/50 males
and females were observed at 20Â°C with side lighting during a 2 hr period.
They were diluted sequentially to 4ml,8ml, and 16m1. The control was a vial
(with 3.1 cm bottom surface area) of 100 males at each density, this
would check for any volume density dependence. The bottom surface area
was held constant to specifically focus on volume.
Tests for surface area effect duplicated the above procedure except
the volume was held constant at 16ml while the bottom surface area was
increased from 3.1 cm to 10.8 cm and then 14.5 cm'.
Scoring was done during 2 min- periods at the beginning, middle and
end of each 2 hr test period. Scoring was on the basis of 1)encounters,
copepods longer than 2 seconds
defined as interactions of 2or
involving movement, and excluding copulating pairs, 2) tail clasping,
