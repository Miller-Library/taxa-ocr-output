motion with the two rows of teeth. Large sections of exoskelton seen in
fecal pellets give evidence that mastication is not thorough, and pieces
are ingested intact.
The role of the other appendages is best described by Fryer.
As food is forced into the mouth the maxillules (lst maxilla)
momentarilly release their hold, move back and again grip the
food, thus drawing the entire mass forward. In this they are
usually assisted by brisk pushing movements of the maxillae (2nd
maxilla) and maxillipeds. As one part of the body of a
chironomoid larva is eaten , a feeding copepod sometimes
moves along to a new region, using the maxillules, maxillae, and
maxillipeds for this purpose much as human hands move along a
rope. (Fryer p. 11)
... the... role... of the more posterior appendages ...(is)
to push food into the mouth. (Fryer , p. 14)
COMPARISON OF THE MOUTH PARTS
The anatomy of the mouth parts have individually been described
in Tigriopus by Sars
(1911) on T. fulvus of Norway and by
Mitakidis: (1949) of T. lilljeborgii in Whitely Bay, England.
A comparison of these with that of Tigriopus californicus shows the
similarities and differences (Table 2). Enough dissimilarities in mouth
parts are present to indicate that these are three related but distinct
species.
