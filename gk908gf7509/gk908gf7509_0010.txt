Anatomy of Mouth Parts
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouth parts of Tigriopus californicus collected from
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California were dissected off, mounted
in polyvinyl alsohol, and immediately drawn. A micrometer in the
compound scope was used for measurements. All parts are drawn to scale.
Drawings were checked with mouth parts of other Tigriopus californicus
to insure accuracy. Also, drawings were compared to limited electron
micrographs of whole Tigriopus californicus. Fecal pellets were examined
for kinds of food in order to estimate the use of different mouth parts.
ANATOMY OF THE MOUTH PARTS
Understanding the anatomy of the mouth parts is a preliminary
step in determining the mechanism and function of them.
A composite drawing shows the orientation of the mouthparts. (Figure 1)
Some have been left out for clarity.
The labrum is a wide flap which terminates in 4 chitinous teeth
and covers the mouth and part of the mandibles. (Figure 2)
The mandible is a long arm ending with 2 rows of teeth. The smaller
teeth are next to the labrum. The mandible has a biramous palp with four
spines and 11 slender setae. (Figure 3)
The first maxilla has 7 basal spines forming a cradle with which to
shove food forward. It has sensory setae on the side palps with a
numbering of 2-3-4-2(?). (Figure 4)
The second maxilla has a large claw with two pectinate setae at the
