Tearse, Tigriopus californicus, Adult Longevity
DISCUSSION
Gravid females outlived non-gravid females, and both outlived
males, the latter dying in half the period shown by gravid females.
This trend of longer living females agrees with Egloff's study (1966)
where he found the mean life expectancy for starved males to be 9
days (23 C) or 14 days (15°c) and for starved females to be 33 days
(23°C and 15°C); whereas when fed, the mean life expectancy for males
was 66 days (23°C) or 120 days (15°C and for females was 33 days (23°c)
or 48 days (15°C) for females.
The present study's mean life expectancy for males of 7.3 days
compares well with Egloff's mean of 9 days. The seven to eight fold increase
shown by Egloff in mean life expectancy when males are fed, would
reflect an adaptive strategy. Under low food conditions, a short male
life wherein males can perform their primary role of insemination
would minimally deplete nutrient supplies needed by gravid females.
When food is plentiful, the tide-pool can support a larger population
allowing males to live longer. In this study, non-gravid females also
show this adaptive strategy of minimally depleting food supplies.
The longevity of starved gravid females can be postulated to
result from 1) eating the hatched nauplii or retracting nutrients from
the egg sac (i.e., food source) 2) having more food reserves. This
differential survival would result in populations being skewed toward
gravid females in tide pools with too little food.
