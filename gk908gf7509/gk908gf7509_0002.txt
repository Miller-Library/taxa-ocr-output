SUMMARY
Simple behavior responses in the presence of the same or a
different sex appear to take place in Tigriopus californicus Baker
among males and appears to be inversely related to surface area
and not volume. Among males, encounters including touching for longer
than two seconds and copulating pairs with another animal whether male
or female were common. Females alone showed no antagonistic behavior.
In longevity studies, gravid females outlived non-gravid females and
outlived males, the latter dying in half to greater than half the
period shown by gravid females.
Finally, an anatomy of mouthparts is shown in illustrations
drawn to scale, and indicates distinct differences in a number of
structures that may be of taxonomic significance.
