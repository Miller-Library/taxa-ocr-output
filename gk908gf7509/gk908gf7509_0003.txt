INTRODUCTION
Tigriopus californicus Baker, a harpacticoid copepod, occurs in
high tidepools along the California coast and is noted for its ability to
withstand inhospitable environmental conditions (1). Due to evaporation
and tidal wash, densities vary greatly. During observation in the
laboratory, males displayed aggressive behavior when in very dense
conditions with other males. Few behavioral studies have been conducted
on Tigriopus californicus and aggressive behavior has not been investigated.
The present study was to determine whether this aggression is density
dependent, as a function of volume or surface area, and if it is a
male and/or female trait.
Under starvation conditions there is a differential sex survival.
In earlier longevity studies, Egloff (1966) showed that the mean life
expectancy for males was significantly less than for females. He did
not compare the differential longevity of females to gravid females.
There would be an adaptive survival significance to the species if the
gravid females were hardier since they carry the future generations. This
possibility was investigated in the present study.
The anatomy and mechanism of the mouth parts was also studied as
this knowledge is necessary for the complete understanding of feeding in
Tigriopus californicus. Also, with an accurate study of the anatomy, one
can compare these appendages to those of other Tigriopus species. In
arthropod taxonomy such fine details of anatomy are part of determining
whether these species are different.
This paper investigates aggressive behavior, longevity and illustrates
mouth parts.
