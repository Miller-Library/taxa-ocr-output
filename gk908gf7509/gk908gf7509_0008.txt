Longevity in Adult Tigriopus californicus
Baker Under Starvation Conditions
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Ninety-nine adult Tigriopus californicus were collected from a
high tide pool on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. Under a
dissecting scope they were sexed for 1)males with claspers on first antennae,
2) females, 3) females with eggs visible in ovarian tubes or egg sacs
(labelled gravid females). To prevent cannibalism, they were separately
put in 1-2 ml filtered sea water (.45mWhatmanand GF/C fiber glass
filters). The water and container was changed every second day to prevent
oxygen depletion and algal growth. They were given no food and exposed
to laboratory conditions (15-22°C). Death was determined under a
dissecting scope as no movement, external or internal.
RESULTS
Fifty percent longevity occurred at 6.8 days for males, 7.4 days
for females and 13.3 days for gravid females. Mean male life expectancy
was 7.3 days. By the end of the experiment, 1002 death had not occured
in the females or gravid females, precluding calculation of the mean
life expectancy. By probit analysis and linear regression, the curves were
shown to be statistically different. Males + Females (p«0.002),
Females + Gravid Females (p«0.02), Males + Gravid Females (p«0.000001).
