Tearse, Tigriopus californicus, Aggressive Behavior
defined as a male clasping the caudal rami of another Tigriopus and
being pulled, 3) copulating pairs, in which a male was attached dorsally to
the cephalothorax of another Tigriopus, male or female. Qualitative
observations were made of bumping into or crawling over other animals
and short burstwhere violent swimming shorter than two seconds was
observed and interpreted as getting out from under other Tigriopus.
RESULTS
Encounters were seen as two males touching ventrally and
swimming, usually in tight circles. Also, they were observed as a few male
Tigriopus aggregating on another male Tigriopus and jerking at him.
The encounters were only found in vials with males present and never in
the female vial. They were never observed to last longer than 30
min. Bumping and short burst observed in all containers decreased
qualitatively with increasing surface area, while remaining constant
with increasing volume. Only in male vials was a decrease in the mean
number of encounters per 2 hr period with increasing bottom surface area
found (Graph 1). The only statistically significant drops in the number
of encounters were in the sequentially run males from 3.1 cmâ€œ to 14.5 cm
(p 0.025) and in the fresh males from 3.1 cm to 10.8 cm (p 0.025).
Other data appear in the graph for comparison.
Copulating pairs occurred in vials containing males and males plus
females, but never in the female vials. Copulating pairs were observed
between 2 males (maximum 12 sightings during a two hour test period)
