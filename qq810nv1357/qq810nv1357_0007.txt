RESULTS
Observations During Starvation
Upon arrival the E. hedgepethi were dark green
with glittery silver speckles. Under a dissection microscope
the green digestive gland could be seen to permeate nearly
every corner of their transparent bodies. After 15 days
without food, the sacoglossans had faded from their original
deep color but were still a dull lime green. After three
days of illumination, many of the slugs were distinctly
yellow in color. The slugs appeared to lose weight on
their strict sea water diet. Both green (fed) and yellow
(starved) slugs were observed to be positively phototaxic.
In both natural and artificial light, most slugs could be
found near the water line on the brightest wall of the glass
tank. When the flourescent lights, normally illuminating one
entire wall, were changed to illuminate only the bottom half
of the wall, most of the slugs migrated down into the
intense light.
Time Course of Chlorophyll Levels
Optical densities of the methanol extracts at 663 nm
were converted to ug chlorophyll per mg body weight and
plotted versus time (figure 1). Chlorophyll content
increased with feeding time. After 5 days it was near
