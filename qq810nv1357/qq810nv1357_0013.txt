FIGURE LEGEND
Figure 1: Chlorophyll content mass * versus feeding
time. 2 slugs per data point. Dashed horizontal line
represents equilibrium value (i.e., assay of slugs which had not
been starved).
Figure 2: Photosynthesis mass  versus feeding time.
2 slugs per data point. Squares = methanol-soluble
photosynthate. Diamonds - methanol-insoluble photosynthate.
Triangles - total photosynthate. Dashed horizontal lines
represent equilibrium values (i.e., assay of slugs which had not
been starved).
