the equilibrium value.
Time Course of Carbon Fixation
Counts per minute (cpm) of the methanol soluble and
insoluble fractions and their sum were normalized to slug
body weight and plotted versus time (figure 2). Carbon
fixation per mg slug increased with feeding time, peaking
at 5 days and then tapering off to the equilibrium value,
Carbon Fixed Per Unit Chlorophyll
The average fixation was 91527 cpm per ug chlorophyll,
with a standard deviation of 40763 cpm per ug chlorophyll.
There was no discernable trend with time; the variations
appeared random.
Intact Codium Versus Isolated Chloroplast Diets
Assays of slugs fed for 7 days on the different diets
are compared in Table 1, with data again normalized to slug
body weight. Slugs fed isolated chloroplasts contained only
1.68 as much chlorophyll per mg as slugs fed intact plants
for the same period of time. Carbon fixation in chloroplast-fed
slugs was just under 108 that of plant-fed slugs.
