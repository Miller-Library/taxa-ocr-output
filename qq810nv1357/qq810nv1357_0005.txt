sea water and chloroplasts isolated from 5 grams of C.
fragile by the method of Shephard, et. al., 1968. The dish
was kept in a 16° room and loosely covered with slitted
plastic wrap to minimize evaporation while permitting gas
exchange.
Assay of Photosynthetic Competence and Chlorophyll Content
Feeding slugs were removed from the C. fragile,
allowed 30 minutes to finish digesting their meal, and then
were blotted and weighed. Each animal was then incubated
for 2 hours in 1 ml of filtered sea water containing 10
uc; of +C-sodium bicarbonate at 16° under
flourescent lighting sufficient to saturate photosynthesis.
Slugs were then removed from the incubation medium and
homogenized in 1 ml methanol. The homogenate was bathed in
approximately 50° water for 10 minutes to extract the
chloroplasts fully, then centrifuged for 2 minutes in an
Eppendorf centrifuge at 12,000 g. The optical density at
663 nm was taken of the supernatant, and the chlorophyll
content determined from the equation ODg3 = 9.83X
[chlorophyll] (Dawson,et. al.,1986). The pellet was
resuspended in 1 ml .5 M NaoH with 58 Triton X and allowed
to dissolve for about an hour. The methanol soluble and
insoluble fractions of the animal were both acidified by
addition of trichloroacetic acid to 108 final concentration,
