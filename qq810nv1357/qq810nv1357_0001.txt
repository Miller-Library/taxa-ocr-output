ABSTRACT
Elysia hedgepethi were starved until free of
chloroplasts. As feeding resumed, re-establishment of the
animal-chloroplast symbiosis was monitered and found to rebound
to normal levels after five to seven days of feeding on Codium
fragile. E. Hedgepethi fed seven days on a diet of isolated C.
fragile chloroplasts did not accumulate chloroplasts
intracellularly to any significant extent.
