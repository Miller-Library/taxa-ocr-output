DISCUSSION
Owing to their availability and the rapid turnover
rate of their chloroplasts, E. hedgepethi were chosen
to follow the time course of re-establishing photosynthetic
capacity in starved animals. Intense light apparently
accelerates the removal of chloroplasts from animal tissue.
This is consistent with Hawes and Cobb's 1980 report that
chloroplasts in E. viridis undergo photodestruction,
and that damaged chloroplasts are removed from the animal
cytoplasm (Trench,1979).Thirty minutes feeding, the first
time point, was essentially equivalent to no feeding, for
the animals had not enough time to get settled and sink
their radulae into the algae. Two hours forty minutes
apparently was also insufficient, for chlorophyll content
and fixation both dropped, presumably due to variance in
the degree of starvation in the E. hedgepethi population.
After one day of feeding, however, chlorophyll content
and fixation increased significantly. The constant amount
of carbon fixed per ug chlorophyll in the animals throughout
the experiment suggests that the initial chloroplasts are
taken up and maintained intact; they are not degraded to
pay for any metabolic debt caused by starvation. Both
chlorophyll content and fixation could be reasonably
construed as logarithmically rising curves. Chloroplasts
reappear in the animals several times faster than they
disappear.
The ratio of fixed carbon that was methanol soluble
to that which was methanol insoluble was fairly constant
