MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection
Codium fragile containing Elysia hedgepethi was
collected subtidally near Santa Barbara, California.
C. fragile for feeding animals and for isolation of
chloroplasts was collected intertidally at Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California.
Starvation
E. hedgepethi maintained in a running sea water
aquarium (16°C) were starved for 18 days. For the first
15 days, their tank received indirect natural light. To
accelerate the loss of chloroplasts from the animal tissue,
flourescent lights were placed near the tank and kept on
continuously for the next 3 days.
Feeding
After starvation, twelve slugs of approximately the same
vellowish color were transferred to a beaker containing
filtered sea water and freshly collected fronds of C.
fragile. The feeding tank was aerated with a bubbling
stone and thermostated in a water bath at 16°0. The
water was replaced daily and the C. fragile semi-daily.
Three starved slugs were placed in a dish with filtered
