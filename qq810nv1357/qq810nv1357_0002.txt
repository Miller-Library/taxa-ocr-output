INTRODUCTION
Prolonged retention of functional chloroplasts in
digestive gland tissues is a common phenomenon among the
Elysiid sacoglossan opisthobranchs (Trench,1975). Sacoglossans
feed on siphonaceous algae, slitting the algal surface with
specially adapted radulae and sucking the cytoplasm out fron
the long, multinucleated coenocytic filaments. Chloroplasts
are phagocytosed into the digestive epithelial cells, then
the phagocytic membranes break down and the chloroplasts
migrate towards the back of the cell, fully contiguous with
the animal cytoplasm (McLean,1976). Indications are that
whereas little or no protein or lipid synthesis occurs in
the translocated chloroplasts, the chloroplasts continue to
produce and release photosynthate into the animal cytoplasm
for extended periods (Trench,1975).
In contrast to many algal-animal symbioses, there is a
turnover of these chloroplasts in the animal, and continued
ingestion is necessary to maintain a standing crop
intracellularly. Hinde and Smith (1972) have shown Elysia
viridis to maintain functional chloroplasts through 60
days' starvation in the light, while Elysia hedgepethi
has been reported to be free of chlorophyll after 10 days
without food (Greene,1970b). How quickly can starved
chloroplast utilizers rebound to normal photosynthetic
