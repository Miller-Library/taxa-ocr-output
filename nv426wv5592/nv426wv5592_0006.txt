Collison
shown with slanted horozontal lines are typical pools from
which cucumberswere collected. The first heavy line repreÂ¬
sents zero tide level and each heavy line "above" it is
roughly one meter in height. A lighter line connected to
a dark line represents about a half meter drop in height.
Collection totals are listed near the area where the
cucumbers were taken. In Area 1, the eleven C. curata
in the front zone were taken from: cracks in vertical
faces, small pools, and small coralline encrusted pockets,
The single C. pseudocurata was found in a dense aggregate
behind Mytilus. The second collection, eleven C. curata
to zero C. pseudocurata, was taken from the two nearest
pools. The cucumbers, it was noted, were always submerged,
but only to depths up to a foot. In Area 2, collections
were taken from inside the bowl, within the bowl, and
outside the bowl. The results were twenty-six C. curata
and zero C. pseudocurata.

These collections were made at a rocky outcropping.
several hundred yards north of Malpaso Creek, and just off
Yankee Point Drive. Figure 3 uses the same schematics as
previously described for Cypress Point. Waves directly hit
the front edge of the rock, and hit more or less at angles
down a channel to the left (south) in the figure. This
collection site shows clearly that a gradient of wave
action is at work here going from well protected, plat-
