Introduction
The case of the two closely related holothuroids.
Cucumaria curata and Cucumaria pseudocurata is of special
ecological and evolutionary interest. In a recent survey
of intertidal invertebrates Brumbaugh (1980) made summary
statements of the literature that describe these two
species as having similar habitats: the surf swept rocks
of the middle to lower intertidal zones of Central California
rocky coastline. He also reports that C. pseudocurata
ranges from the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia
to Monterey County, California while C. curata was only
known along one mile of coast from Yankee Point to Malpaso
Creek in Monterey County. The morphology and biological
aspects of C. pseudocurata have been described, however.
C. curata has had only taxonomic work published on it
(Cowles, 1907).
Not only are the two species alike in habitat, but
external morphological similarities complicate their study,
A set of field criteria have been established to help disÂ¬
tinguish between species (Brumbaugh, 1980). These criteria,
however, are of use only to one familiar with the cucumbers.
or when one has both species and a hand lens for close
comparison. Positive identification of the species must
be made by examination of body wall spicules, which are
obtained by dissecting away a small piece of the body wall
