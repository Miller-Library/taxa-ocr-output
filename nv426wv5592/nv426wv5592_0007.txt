formed pools ten meters or more from the surf to the ver¬
tically facing fronts near the low tide level.
Collections were made in relation to this gradient
of exposure. Beginning with the set of three pools most
distant from the surf, the collection made in this rela¬
tively shallow, flat pool (which sits just at the top
of Mytilus beds) shows that all twenty-four cucumbers
collected were C. pseudocurata. Similar results were ob¬
tained at the pool in the center, which was positioned with
nearly the same zoning pattern. The pool was at a distance
of ten meters from the surf, being protected from the
surf by a surge channel directly in front of it. Results
of a collection made from a variety of angles, walls, and
depths, but always within the pool, showed that there were

bers were situated in aggregates on encrusting corallines
at the bases of Corallina, and usually on flat surfaces.
Moving up the gradient, to more exposed areas at about
one to two meters from the surf, a collection area is defined
by boundry lines. This area is intermediate in wave action.
No cucumbers were ever found here on dry vertical faces,
but were always submerged, and often were wedged into the
encrusting coralline algae, at times in association with
Corallina. Collections totaled twenty-two cucumbers in
this area: nine were C. curata and thirteen were C. pseudo-
curata.
