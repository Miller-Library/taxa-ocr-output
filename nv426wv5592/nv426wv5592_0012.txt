to C. curata as a substrate. The encrusting corallines,
being a smooth, thick film, readily conforms to the sea
cucumber's body, providing a tight fit. Other associates
are Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and occasional Haliotus
and Leptasterius. The area was usually situated at the
top of the laminarias, with scattered Iridea and Gigar
tina. Totals in these areas, not including Cypress Point,
are seventy-three C. curata and four C. pseudocurata.
Intermediate areas of exposure had mixed distributions
of the two species. The cucumbers were on both flat bottomed
pools, and above pool levels on vertical faces, but not
nearly in the numbers of the back and front respectively.
Total number of C. curata was forty-eight, and a total of
twenty-eight for C. pseudocurata.
The two interrelated factors in the niche differences
are wave action and dessication (lower limits of C. pseudo¬
curata outside of range overlap seem to be determined by
Pycnopodia helianthoides according to a study by Ruther-
ford,1973 ). In the protected areas, abscence of cucum¬
bers on vertical walls above pool level can be attributed
to problems of desiccation. In the exposed areas, at the
other end of the gradient, wave force seems to be a problem
for C. pseudocurata. Rutherford (1973 ) indicated in a
study on C. pseudocurata that surf was an important source
of mortality. One finds in unprotected areas that the
cucumbers are well wedged, in cracks, and under Mytilus.
