up the reef to higher, more protected pools behind the exposed
faces. Horizontal swaths of approximately i m width
of equivalent conditions of exposure, slope, and visgosity,
were examined for Cucumaria, where they were often found
aggregated and in habitat niche characterization. A few
separate individuals were also found. These areas are
recognized as typical of Zones 3 and 4 in Ricketts and
Calvin (1968) belonging to "Open-Coast Rocky Shores.
Collections were made at negative tides when surf
was moderate. Specimens were collected with broad-tipped
forceps and placed in small numbered vials. Associated
physical and biological observations were recorded. In
the lab, they were placed in sea water, and allowed to relax,
Measurements of length were then taken, and a small piece
of the body wall was dissected for identification purposes
Earlier collections were also characterized for color and
tentacular morphology. Efforts were made in earlier collect¬
ing to take only individuals from groups to gain the most
variation across the belt of habitat. Later collecting
included taking one to three members from a group of specific
habitat (e.g. vertical faces of rocks in the lowest inter-
tidal region). It is doubtful that results were biased
by choice of individuals collected due to preconceptions
because of the difficulty of species identification in
the field. The lower and more exposed situations were prob¬
