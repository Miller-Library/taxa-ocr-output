ably under collected due to the presence of dangerous surf.
It probably also lead to overcollection of the larger,
more conspicuous individuals, despite every attempt to make
a thorough search. The wet suit was a great aid to the col¬
lector in these situations.

Morphology and Color

Sixty-one cucumbers from the collection sites (Cypress
point, Pescadero Point, Yankee Point - Malpaso Creek)
that possessed ten equal tentacles proved to be C. curata.
Likewise, of twenty-seven cucumbers observed to have eight
larger tentacles with two smaller, ventrally located tentacles
all were C. pseudocurata.
Lengths of all cucumbers collected were measured and
plotted in Figure 1. The measurements taken were not
fully extended lengths, but were taken under uniform conditions.
The average length for C. curata (151 individuals) was 14.7 mm
as compared to 15.3 mm average length for C. pseudocurata
(126 individuals). The graph seems to show normal dis¬
tribution. Qualitatively, it might be added that C. curata
was the larger, heavier individual and C. pseudocurata
was usually thinner.
Qualitative features of the cucumbers proved to be
relatively constant through the study sites. The C. curata
examined, with few exceptions, were (observed under dissection
