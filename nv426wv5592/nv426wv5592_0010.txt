channels. This area is exposed to the brunt of the wave
action. It is characterized by a large Mytilus bed (also
Policipes) and a thick mat of Corallina and Caliarthron.
In the surge channels and pockets there are Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus, and at the lower edges there is the top layer of
the laminarians. Collections in this area (zone 4) ranged
from pocketed pools to vertical faces at zero tide level.
Of the twenty-eight cucumbers collected, twenty-seven were
C. curata, and one was C. pseudocurata, which was found in
a cluster under Mytilus. All of the cucumbers in this area
were well embedded in the encrusting coralline algae along
cracks on vertical faces or on horizontal surfaces. Close
association with Corallina was often noted.
One survey focused on one particular micro-habitat:
vertical walls of rocks outside of the pools, and not im¬
mersed in water. Collections were taken at both Pescadero
Point and Yankee Point - Malpaso Creek, and included both
lone and aggregate formations. The cucumbers were usually
along cracks, small pockets in encrusting corallines, and
under Mytilus. At Yankee Point - Malpaso, forty cucum¬
bers were collected: thirty-eight were C. curata, and two
were C. pseudocurata. Pescadero Point collections totaled
twenty-six: twenty-five were C. curata, and one was C.
pseudocurata. All three pseudocurata identified were lodged
behind Mytilus.
