Collison
The most exposed area,within one meter of the zero
tide line, cucumbers were found for the first time on ver¬
and
tical walls,,usually in a crack or well imbedded in en-
crusting coralline. Generally, Corallina and Caliarthron
also were in association. Cucumbers collected were as
follows: on vertical walls, out of pools, thirty-six were
C. curata and two were C. pseudocurata. In pools of this
area, ten were C. curata with one being C. pseudocurata.
Totals were fourty-six C. curata to only three C. pseudo¬
curata. The two C. pseudocurata found on vertical walls were
underneath Mytilus in tight aggregations.
Pescadero Point
Pescadero Point is the best example of a site with
differential wave action and varying degrees of desiccation.
The site consists of a wide front to the impinging waves,
with a small wash area breaking in to the right (Figure 4).
Located at the bottom of the figure, is a main pool about
20-25 meters from the leading edge of low tide. Moving from
the pool toward the surf, there is a gentle incline (con¬
sisting of a Mytilus bed) coming to a two foot ridge, which
begins a sloping rock face into the surf. Working to the
right, the pool narrows to a gentle, declining drain off
area and into another pooled area, which has wash feeding into
it.
