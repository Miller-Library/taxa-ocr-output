No studies have investigated the very restricted
distribution of C. curata, nor its apparent coexistence
in what is described as the same habitat with C. pseudo-
curata, in areas of range overlap. This study was designed
to gain information on the specific habitat niches of the
two species. It is a general dictum of evolution and ecology
that two species cannot occupy the same ecological niche.
The further interesting questions of the restricted range
of C. curata (correctly Cypress Point to Malpaso Creek,
Monterey County) and the apparent sympatric speciation
still await study.
Methods
Three areas, all in Monterey County, were chosen for
the habitat study on the two holothuroids: Cypress Point,
Pescadero Point, and the Yankee Point to Malpaso Creek area.
Preliminary samplings made to discover adequate popu¬
lations of the two species, so that their specific habitat
niches could be characterized, indicated that C. curata
was generally found in more exposed situations than C.
pseudocurata. This information was used to design a strati-
fied sampling program for complex rocky shores, which examined
