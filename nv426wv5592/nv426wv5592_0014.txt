Summary
1. Three sites in Monterey County, California (Cypress
Point, Pescadero Point, and Yankee Point-Malpaso Creek,
were chosen to study microhabitatual differences in two
closely related holothuroids, Cucumaria curata and Cucu¬
maria pseudocurata.
2. Collections were taken along a gradient of exposure,
from protected pools receiving occasional, moderated
splash at low tides to the lowest levels of the inter-
tidal receiving heavy, constant splash, to determine dis¬
tribution of both species. C. curata dominated in the
exposed situations, whereas C. pseudocurata dominated
in the protected areas.
3. Two interrelated factorsin the niche differences are wave
action and desiccation, which were moderated by the cucum¬
bers' association with encrusting corallines, Corallina,
Caliarthron, and Mytilus, the behavior of clinging into
depressions, and the habit of aggregation.
