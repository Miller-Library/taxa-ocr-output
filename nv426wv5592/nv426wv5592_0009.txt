The main pool represents a fairly well protected.
stable area exposed to occasional splash from surf spilling
over the ridge (more specific characteristics may be found
in Brumbaugh, 1965). Collections in this pool ranging over
a variety of surface inclines within the pool, resulted in
all fo-rty cucumbers identified as C. pseudocurata. The
cucumbers were in close aggregations and often at the
base of Corallina and Caliarthron.
In the pool below the drain off area, to the right in
the figure, another collection was made. This pool effecÂ¬
tively represents an area intermediate in wash; heavy
Corallina growth on encrusting coralline algae. Twenty-
seven C. curata versus six C. pseudocurata were collected
here. The cucumbers typically were imbedded into the en-
crusting algae on horizontal surfaces.
Another pool intermediate in exposure is located up
the gentle incline from the main pool, and just below the
ridge. Feeding it was a deep surge channel, that occasionally
brought waves splashing into it. It was located in the
middle of Mytilus beds. Collections made here varied from
horizontal surfaces within the pool to vertical faces both
within and above the pool. Collected were twelve C. curata
to nine C. pseudocurata. All of the cucumbers collected on
vertical surfaces above pool level proved to be C. curata.
Last of the zones at Pescadero Point is the front
incline, which has many vertical faces, pockets, and surge
