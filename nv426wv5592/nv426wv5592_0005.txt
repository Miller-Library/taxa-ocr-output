scope with light) dark brown, sometimes lighter, with
vellowish tint on the dorsal side. Ventrally they were
white to yellowish at the sides, varying in the amount of
white. The C. pseudocurata examined proved to have a greater
variance in color. Dorsal side was normally chocolate brown
(black in sunlight) but ranged to gray, with some specimens
from Sonoma County white. Ventrally they ranged from tan
to white with pigment peppered throughout. The lighter
colored individuals came from shaded spots, such as underÂ¬
neath Mytilus beds. No conspicuous differences were observed
in podia distribution or shape.
Niche Characterization
Results of collections at Cypress Point, Yankee Point -
Malpaso Creek area, and Pescadero Point (Figures 2-4)
will be presented in this order which represents a widening
gradient of wave exposure. Finally, a collection based on
vertical and horizontal surfaces at Yankee Point - Malpaso
Creek area and at Pescadero Point will be reported.
Cypress Point
The Cypress Point collection site consists of two
collection areas labelled in Figure 2, and is representative
of exposed outer coast, and Zone 3 to Zone 4 (Ricketts
and Calvin, 1968). In the schematic map, closely spaced
horizontal lines represent impinging wave action with the
direction of force perpendicular to the lines. The pools
