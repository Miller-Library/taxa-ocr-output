INTRODUCTION
The blood clot formed in decapod crustaceans
was described by Fredericg (1879) and Halliburton
(1665) as a jelly-like aglutination, consisting of
a cross-hatching of fibers to which is attached an
amorphous, granulated gel. Although

obse
ved an effect induced by variations in hydrogen
ion conent
ation and alium io on the clot
ng mech¬
anism in some decapod crustaceans, no investigation
of the effect of hydrogen ion and calcium ion on
the process in cirripeds has been reported.
This is a report of a study of the clotting
mechanism of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus nubilus : Exact'>Balanus nubilus</span> (Darwin, 1854) and
the effect of calcium ion and hydrogen ion on the
process.
MATERIALS AND
THODS
Specimens of B. nubilus were collected with

their basal calcareous plates intact from the pliings
of Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California, and kept
29
in running sea water until used.
The blood was removed by puncturing the basal
plate, removing excess debris w
ith forceps, and
mantle cavity fluid with a water aspirator. Blood
was withdra
n from the ventral thoracic sinus using

aone ml. plas
i syringe contain
ing 0.4 ml. of a
10 solution of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
disodium salt (EDTA) adjusted to a pH of 7.1 and fitted
with a 22-gauge needle coated with Beckman's
sicote, to minimize contact with wettable su
faces.
Generally, 0.6 ml. samples of blood were withdrawn
rred to a glass centrifuge tube conta:
ining
and transfe:
10% EDTA and 3% Nacl so that the final ratio of blood,
EDTA, and Nacl was 1:3:l respectively.
iis sample was then centrifuged immediately at
approximately 1500xG to remove any
particulate matter,
including any clot formed during the collect
tion of
blood. One ml. aliquots of the supernatant were used
in the eper
ntal procedures described below and
amounted to a l:5 dilution of the blood.
Acetate and tris (hydroxymethyl) a
inomethane
(Tris) buffers were prepared acco
ing to the method
of Gomori (1955); except buffers with a pH from 2.0
rom a mixture of 50 ml. of 0.2M
to 3.5 were preparedi
acetic acid (diluted to a total volume of 100 ml.)
and 5 ml. of 0.2M sodium acetate to which was added
glacial acetic acid until the mixture reached the
desired pH values. Similarly, buffers in the range from
6.7 to 10.0 were prepared from 50 ml. of a 0.2M Tris
solution (diluted to a total volume of 200 ml.) to
which was added Tris u
til the desired pH values were
reached.

The amount of clot was estimated in terms of its
protein content as measured by the method of Lowry (1951)
after dissolving the clot in 2% Naco, in O.1N NaoH.
RESULT
he ef?
slect of calcium ion on clot formation
To a one ml. sample of diluted blood containing
2TA was added an additional ml. of 3% Nagl, plus one
ml. of a solution of calcium chloride of molarities
ranging from 0.00625M to O.5M. Samples were allowed to
stand at room temperature for 6 hours, then centrifuged.
the supernatant removed, and the clot washed twice
in a 3% Nacl solution.. The clot was then dissolved
in 5 ml. of a 2% Naco, in O.lN NaoH solution and one
mi. aliquots were removed for protein analysis.
Fig. 1. presents the results. Even without the
addition of calcium chloride, a small amount of par-
ticulate protein was formed. This small amount remained
constant until the solution of calcium chloride added
exceeded 0.025M. The addition of levels in excess of
this amount induced clot formation.

To a one ml. sample of diluted blood containing
EDTA was added one ml. of buffer and one ml. of 0.2M
calcium chloride solution, an amount sufficient to
yield near maximum clot. The procedure follows exactly
the protocol used for calcium dependency above.
Fig. 2. relates pH values to the effectiveness
of a 0.2M calcium chloride solution to induce clot
formation. Between pH 2.0 and 4.5 the amount of
O
particulate protein remains at a low level approx-
lately equal to the amount of protein obtained with
the pre-threshold concentrations of calcium in Fig. 1.
At pil values above 4.5 the amount of clot increases
steadily to a maximum value at a pH equal to 6.7.
hen decreases at approximately the same rate, reaching
a zero clot value at a pH of 10.0.
