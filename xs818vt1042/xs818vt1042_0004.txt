relationship between mantle cavity fluid and blood in the content of
proline and hydroxyproline. These differences suggest that the amino
acids found in the mantle cavity fluid are not contaminants from the
blood.
Why amino acids are excreted by Crustacea is not known. One
explanation suggested by Parry (1960) is that the Crustacea cannot
ficiently metabolize all amino acids. The present findings, showing
that eight amino acids are excreted, would require modification of
this hypothesis, since it seems doubtful that the organism would have
lost almost one-half of the genetic machinery involved in amino acid
catabolism. It is conceivable, however, that the excretion of these
amino acids represents an overload of amino acids resulting from an
excessive amount of protein in the diet.
Amino acid excretion could also represent an alternate mechanism
for avoiding toxic concentrations of ammonia, since ammonia could accumulate
when the animal is exposed at low tide and injure the adult or its brooded
larvae. If this is the case, the organisms have chosen the extremely
expensive route of simply not oxidizing a large number of amino acids.
his would seem extremely wasteful, especially since several of the amino
acids found, such as lysine, have very low nitrogen/carbon ratios.
Norman (1967) has found that embryos in the ovigerous lamellae can
utilize lysine and leucine for protein synthesis. Since these amino acids
were found in the mantle cavity, there is possibly some utilization of
these amino acids by the larvae. However, amino acid excretion does not
