solution desalted by passage through Dowex 50 (H* form). The amino acids
were eluted with 1 N NHOH, evaporated to dryness in a flash-evaporator
at 50° C., and the residue redissolved in 1/2 milliliter of distilled
water. For analysis of blood amino acids, 1/4 milliliter of Balanus
glandula blood was collected from the main ventral blood sinus, added
mediately to an equal volume of TCA, and processed in the same manner.
Tive to ten microliters of solution were applied in 0.5 microliter
aliquots to Whatman l paper. The initial chromatograms, which first
indicated the presence of amino acids, were prepared by two-dimensional
ascending chromatography using n-butanol-acetic acid-water (l:1:5) as
the first solvent, followed by n-butanol-methyl ethyl ketone-water (2:2:1).
nal identifications were made on amino acids separated by one-dimensional
descending chromatography run simultaneously with 1 per cent amino acid
standards in systems of n-butanol-acetic acid-water (4:1:5) and n-butanol-
methyl ethyl ketone-water (2:2:1) in a chamber saturated with cyclohexyl-
amine fumes (Mizell and Simpson, 1960). The chromatograms were dried in
a 75° C. oven for 30 minutes, sprayed with.25% ninhydrin in acetone with
78 v/v acetic acid, and heated at 85° C. for 15 minutes.
Identification of amino acids was made on the basis of the character-
istic colors produced by ninhydrin in the presence of cyclohexylamine
(Mizell and Simpson, 1960), on the basis of their co-chromatography in
the above two solvents with amino acid standards, and on the basis of
results with specific colorimetric location reagents. The location reagents
used were platinic iodide reagent for sulfur-bearing amino acids (Block, 1958),
