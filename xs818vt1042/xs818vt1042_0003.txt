The results showed the presence of eight amino acids in the mantle
cavity fluid. Table I lists those present and indicates the relative
intensity of the ninhydrin-positive spots. Amino acid composition of the
blood was also determined (Table I). A major difference between blood
and mantle cavity fluid is that the blood had hydroxyproline and traces
of proline, while the mantle cavity fluid had large amounts of proline
and no hydroxyproline. Serine and leucine, which were present in the
mantle cavity fluid, were not present in the blood. The concentration
of lysine seemed to be far greater in the mantle cavity fluid than in
the blood. These differences can also be seen in Figure I, which depicts
a chromatogram in which the amino acids of blood and mantle cavity fluid
were simultaneously separated. The figure also shows the position of
an unidentified yellow, ninhydrin-positive substance with an approximate
Rf of 10 in n-butanol-acetic acid-water.

The above results show that eight amino acids are present in barnacle
mantle cavity fluid, and that these are not completely identical to those
present in barnacle blood. Of particular interest is the inverse
