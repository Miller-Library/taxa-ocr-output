depend on the presence of the larvae, since the amino acid content
was identical during and after the reproductive season.
Further study of the mantle cavity fluid, blood, and diet are
required to clarify the significance of this aminchacid excretion.
SUMMARY
Separated by paper chromatography, eight amino acids were identified
lam
in tho mantio cavity fluid of
glandula. They are glutamic acid,

lysine, proline, alanine, valine, serine, leucine, and arginine. These
amino acids do not compare identically with those found in the blood of
the same organism, one main difference being the presence of hydroxy-
proline and traces of proline in the blood, and the absence of hydroxy-
proline and large concentrations of proline in the mantle cavity fluid.
Reasons for the presence of amino acids in the mantle cavity are discussed.
