TRODUCTION
Several workers have reported the presence of high concentrations
of amino acids in the excretory fluid of Crustaceans (reviewed by Prosser
and Brown, 1961; see also Delaunay, 1927; Dresel and Moyle, 1950). For
example, as much as 18 to 27% of the nitrogen in Maja urine is reportedly
present in the form of free amino acids (Delaunay, 1927). However, there
seems to be little information available on the identity of amino acids
excreted by Crustacea nor is it clear how widespread this phenomena is
in the class.
In the present report the excretory fluid of an intertidal acorn
barnacle was analyzed for free amino acids. Eight amino acids were
separated and identified by techniques of paper chromatography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Excretory fluid was collected from the mantle cavity of the barnacle
3alanus glandula Darwin, 1854. The organism was removed from the rock
in such a way that the calcareous bottom plate was left on the rock but
the tissue layer forming the floor of the mantle cavity was left intact.
Through this semi-transparent membrane the mantle cavity fluid was
collected with a syringe. Approximately 75 organisms were needed to
collect one milliliter of fluid.
One milliliter of the fluid was deproteinized by addition of one
volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The TCA was removed with four to five
ether extractions. The pH was adjusted to pH 7 with O.1 N NH),OH and the
