Introduction
Littorina planaxis is a an intertidal snail found abundantly on the west
coast of North America from Charleston, Oregon to Baja California. It grazes
on the microalgae which grow upon the rocks, living high in the intertidal
zone (Morris, et al., 1980). The rocks upon which the snails live are highly
variable in topography and composition, providing a range of habitats. The
substrate is likely to play a large role in the ecology of many intertidal
animals. Cracks and indentations in the rock provide the snails with
protection from wave exposure and desiccation. The microalgae they eat may
grow differently from rock to rock. Smoother rock may allow the snail to
crawl farther in a given amount of time, rather than navigating the jagged
bumps in rocks with a more complex topography. Studies on other intertidal
animals have shown that the substrate may affect their population turnover.
density and movement patterns (Underwood and Chapman, 1985; Raffaelli
and Hughes, 1978).
In this study, two aspects of the substrate were examined for their
affects on Littorina planaxis. The topography of two types of rock, granite and
basalt, was examined to find whether the roughness of a rock played a role in
the snailâ€™s movement patterns or population density.
In examining the movement of a population of animals, it can be
difficult to describe which factors play a role in the movement of the group
Measurements can be made of the speed, direction or distance of an
individual, but often cannot be extended to describe the more complex
movements of the population. In most cases, the movement pattern of the
population as a whole is more relevant than that of a given individual. For
example, genetic mixing of a population may be affected by the distance a
