of the group was considered to be an acceptable measure of diffusion. Because
the day to day measurements of the spread of the snails was so variable, likely
due to changing environmental factors such as weather, temperature or tidal
height, diffusion was measured as the net spread of the snails over the entire
three day period. This tends to average the spread over the three days and
decreases the noise from environmental factors. The diffusion of the snails in
the six sites were then tested for the effect of rock type and roughness using a
nested ANOVA. Because the variances of among sites were heterogeneous
(Cochranâ€™s test), data were log-transformed prior to analysis. A second
ANOVA was performed on the population counts taken from each of the
sites to test for differences in population density between rock types and
topographies. The population data were analyzed in their untransformed
state.
In an attempt to quantify the fractal dimension of the rock, a mold was
taken of each rock site using liquid latex in four cases and Instamold in two
cases. The molds were then cut lengthwise and the profile of the rock traced
so it could be digitized by a computer. A computer program was then used to
analyze the fractal dimension of the rock in the following way (Morse,
Lawton, Dodson and Williamson, 1985). A box was drawn around each
digitized rock profile. The box was then divided into four, and four into
sixteen, up to 1024 boxes. For each level of subdivision, the computer
counted the number of boxes in which the line was found. The slope of the
regression of the natural logarithm of the number of boxes in which the line
was found to the natural logarithm of the size box is an estimate of the fractal
dimension of the rock. Then the digitized line was rotated a random amount
and the same count done. The line was rotated four times, giving four
estimates of the fractal dimension of the rock, which were averaged. A
