Materials and Methods
The experiment was conducted at a point in Carmel Bay where basalt
and granite can be found in close proximity. Three sites were chosen on each
rock type that were visually classified as having rough, intermediate and
smooth topography. The sites were chosen at equivalent tidal heights in the
mid-littorina zone for and checked for similar wave exposure at high tide in
order to control as much as possible for these factors. Three trials were then
run on each of the six sites. On day 0 of each trial, a 0.25m2 quadrat was
cleared of Littorina planaxis, and the number of snails recorded. Thirty of the
snails taken from the site were then chosen randomly, marked with a dot of
enamel paint and placed at a point in the center of the quadrat marked as the
origin. Each day for the following three days, the positions of the snails were
recorded to the closest centimeter as Cartesian coordinates from the origin. A
minimum of 20 snails were recovered at any time. Three replicate diffusion
trials were performed on each of the rock sites.
To find the diffusion of the snails, the spatial variance was calculated at
each time period as:
L(X-X)?
n-1
here X = mean position of the snails
x = position of one snail
n = total f of snails recovered.
Because the diffusion model assumes random movement of the snails, the
diffusion of the snails in both the x and y direction were calculated. Using the
Student's t-test, movement in both directions could not be shown to be
different. Therefore, the radial distance of the snails from the mean position
