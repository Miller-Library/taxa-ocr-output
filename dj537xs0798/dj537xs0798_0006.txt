dimension of 1 indicates a perfectly smooth surface, with increasing values as
the complexity of the surface increases.
Results
The fractal dimensions of the rock profiles were found to lie between
1.08 and 1.12 for all the sites, and were not statistically different among sites.
The mean spatial variance after three days ranged from 246.5 cm'on
the rough basalt site to 777.3 cm’ in the intermediate granite site. In all three
granite sites, the means of diffusion were greater than the means of diffusion
on the three basalt sites. However, the standard error was large because of the
variance in the diffusion rates from day to day and trial to trial (fig. 1). The
pooled mean for the spatial variance of granite sites was 543.4 cm’ while the
pooled mean of the basalt sites was 286.1 cm?
The ANÖVA performed on the diffusion of the snails showed the
roughness of the rock not to have a statistically significant effect on the
diffusion of the snails. However, the diffusion on the granite was found to be
significantly different than the diffusion on the basalt to a level of P =,052
(table 1), with granite having the larger diffusion.
An ANOVA was also done to compare the population densities of the
snails on the six rock sites (table 2). Although a graph shows a trend of
decreasing population density with decreasing rugosity in both rock types, and
a higher mean density in the basalt than the granite, these trends were not
statistically significant (fig. 2).
Discussion
The ANOVA performed on the diffusion data showed no statistical
difference of the movement of Littorina planaxis within the rock types. This
would indicate that the roughness of the rock did not substantially affect the
diffusion of the snails. Similar studies on related intertidal snails, Littoring
