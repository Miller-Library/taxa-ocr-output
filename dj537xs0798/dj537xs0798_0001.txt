Abstract
Littorina planaxis, an intertidal snail, is abundant on a variety of substrata.
Iwo rocks, granite and basalt, were examined to determine if the rock type or
the roughness of the rock influenced the movement pattern or population
density of the snail. A diffusion model was used to quantify the spread of the
snail across the rock in rough, intermediate and smooth areas on each rock
type. Additionally, the fractal dimension of the rock was measured on each
site in an attempt to quantify the topography of the rock and to provide a less
subjective estimate of roughness or smoothness.
The roughness of the rock was not found to have an effect on the
diffusion of the snail. However, there was an almost significant difference
(p=.052) between the movements of the snails on the granite and the basalt,
with snails spreading faster on the granite. Neither the rock type nor the
roughness of the rock was found to influence the population density of the
snails. While the diffusion model provided interesting information about
the movement patterns of the snail, the fractal dimension analysis was not
found to be helpful because no differences could be found in the fractal
dimension of the rock.
