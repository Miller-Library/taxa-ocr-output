The population density of Littorina planaxis was not found to be
dependent on the complexity or type of the substratum, and data on related
species do not show a consistent correlation of topography and population
density. Crevices and pits have been shown to affect population density of
Littorina rudis (Emson and Faller-Fritsch, 1976; Raffaelli and Hughes, 1978)
while Littorina unifasciata did not show any relationship between
topography and population density (Underwood and Chapman, 1985).
Intuitively, it might seem that surface complexities would influence the
population density of snails. In rougher areas, the snails have more cracks
and depressions for protection from wave exposure. Without protection, the
littorines might be more easily washed from the rock, which would tend to
decrease the size of the population. Because all density counts were taken
between the months of April and June, these results reflect only the
springtime population densities. It may be interesting to repeat the
comparison of population densities during the winter months when storms
may impose greater wave forces.
Fractal dimension is a useful tool in describing some aspects of nature.
It has been used to describe the complexity of algae (Dau, 1995), the path of
clownfish while swimming (Coughling, Strickler and Sanderson, 1992), and
the shape of coral reefs (Bradbury and Reichelt, 1983; Mark, 1984). However.
In this study, fractal analysis did not prove to be useful in quantifying the
different complexities of specific sites on rock. Despite the perceived
differences in the complexity of the substrate, the fractal dimension was not
found to be significantly different from site to site.
Using the diffusion model to describe the movement of a population
across a substrate provided interesting information about the snails and
questions for further thought and study, such as the average spread of the
