group of snails spread in a breeding period. In order to more closely examine
the behavior of a population, the pattern of movements of a group of animals
should be measured rather than those of single animals. A diffusion model
is one way to measure the movement of a population. Diffusion is usually
used to describe the random motion of gas molecules due to thermal energy
However, it can also be used to describe other systems (Berg, 1993). In this
case, Ã  diffusion model is used by analogy to describe the random motion of a
group of snails across a rock face. Using this model, the spread of the snails
across a substrate over a given period of time can be measured. Finding the
rate of spread of the population can be relevant information in learning about
immigration, emigration, and the gene flow within or among populations in
a given area.
Quantifying the differences in the substrate is an obstacle to objectively
examining its effect on intertidal animals. It is easy to categorize different
rocks, but how can the topography of the rock be adequately described? Often
the best attempt when studying the effect of substrate on animals is simply to
use a subjective measure, such as rough or smooth. This is usually less than
ideal because one person's perception of the differences in a rock do not alloy
a comparison to other rocks on an absolute scale. Additionally, as humans
we cannot know how a rock is perceived by an animal on a totally different
size scale. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, the fractal dimension o
the rock was used to describe the complexity of the topography of the rock.
Fractal geometry provides a useful way to describe the irregularities of the
surfaces often found in nature because it takes into account not only the
complexity of the surface but also the scale of its measurement.
