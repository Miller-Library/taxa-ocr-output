from the temporal rate of change in the variance (Berg, 1993):

With the diffusion coefficient, the spread of the snails over a given period of
time can be calculated.

Using these equations, the average spread of the snails on the basalt and on
the granite can be calculated. The mean variance after three days on basalt
was 286 cm' while on granite the mean variance was 543.4 cm’. Plugging in
these values gives a diffusion coefficient of 47.5 cm’day" for basalt and 90.6
cm'day“ for granite. Using these diffusion coefficients in the second
equation, the average displacement for a snail in one day on basalt is 13.8 cm.
and on granite is 19.0 cm. However, according to the diffusion model the
displacement of the snails from the mean varies with the square root of time.
rather than with time. For one year, the average displacement of a snail from
