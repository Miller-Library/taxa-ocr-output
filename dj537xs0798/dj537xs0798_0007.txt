unifasciata showed an increased distance traveled on less complex surfaces
related to directional snail movement (Underwood and Chapman, 1989).
However, by using diffusion as a model, the distance traveled by the snails in
this study was only indirectly measured. Rather, the spread of a group of
snails was calculated. Implicit in the calculation of diffusion is a correction
for a changing mean position of the group. The group of snails could travel a
great distance in the same direction, but if the spread of their positions
relative to each other was not great, a small diffusion coefficient would be
calculated. From this data no conclusions can be made about the absolute
distance traveled by the snail, or how it may or may not relate to the
roughness of the substrate.
The ANOVA of diffusion as a function of rock type, although not quite
statistically significant at p =.052, suggests that the diffusion of the snails on
granite may be higher than that on the basalt. Although this experiment does
not meet the traditionally accepted significance level of p-.05, it is close
enough to warrant a closer look at rock type as a factor in snail movement.
Repeated trials with an increased sample size are necessary before these
results can be considered conclusive.
Other rock types should also be examined for an influence on the
movement of the snails. If it were found that the effect of rock type is real.
interesting questions are raised. If it is not the roughness of the different rock
types that influences the movement of the snails, what other aspects of the
rock might? One possibility could be a difference in growth of microalgae on
the two rock types. BecauseLittorina planaxis grazes on the microalgae,
differential abundance or types which grow on the granite and the basalt
might be examined as a factor in the movement of the snails.
