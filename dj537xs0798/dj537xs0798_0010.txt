the mean position on basalt would be 186 cm and on granite would be 257 cm.
If the snails do conform to the diffusion model, this would mean that the
average displacement of the snail in a day may be on the scale of tens of
centimeters, but over a year the average displacement is only on the scale of a
few meters! Of course, snails do not perfectly mimic the motion of
molecules. The diffusion model assumes random motion, with an equal
probability of the snail moving in any direction. In reality, the snails are
likely to be influenced by the cracks in the rock or by following the trail of
Ã¶ther snails. It would be interesting to track snails over a longer period of
time to see if their movements do match the predicted values. Further
analysis should be conducted to find how diffusion may be related to the
ecology of animals.
