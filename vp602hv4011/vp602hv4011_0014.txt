habitat may be made by examining the relative mass of the digestive gland compared to
those of individuals from pristine sites.
There are many directions to take in future studies on GST activity in M.
galloprovincialis as an indicator of marine pollution. Though this paper suggests a strong
correlation between GST activity and marine pollution, more studies would provide
evidence for whether organic pollutants are the cause of elevated detoxification enzyme
activity. Including other enzyme pathways, as well as expanding the time course
experiment as mentioned above would supply more conclusive data for the dependence
of enzymatic detoxification on pollutants in the water.
Future studies: possible confounding factors
There are many factors other than pollutant concentration that may vary among
sites, but which this study did not consider. What are the effects of seasonal changes,
including climate and run-off, on the mussels in each site? Do GST activity levels vary
with the reproductive cycle of each individual? How does food availability vary among
the sites?
In future studies, I would perform variations of the time course with more
controls. In addition to moving M. galloprovincialis from a polluted site into a clean site,
1 would transplant individuals from a clean site to a site higher in pollutant concentration.
1 would also control for seasonal and shorter-term variations by taking parallel
measurements of individuals that had not been transplanted. Dosing organisms from a
clean site with known concentrations of organic chemicals in the laboratory would show
the organismâ€™s detoxification response to only one pollutant at a time.
