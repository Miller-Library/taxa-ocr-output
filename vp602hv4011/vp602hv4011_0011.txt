statistically different (by Tukey-Kramer, p « 0.05) from activity levels at Palo Alto
(0.072 + 0.034 mAbs/min) and Monterey (0.063 + 0.021 mAbs/min) (ANOVA p = 6.66 x

However, Figure 7 does not take into account the effect differing body size on
GST activity. To correct for this, the data were normalized to total tissue wet weight, as
shown in figure 8. Total tissue wet weight was extrapolated in each case from valve
dimensions using the equation noted above. The activity at Moss Landing (0.0573 +
0.0226 mAbs/min/g tissue) was significantly higher than the activities at both Palo Alto
(0.0327 + 0.0140 mAbs/min/g tissue) and Monterey (0.0228 + 0.0068 mAbs/min/g
tissue) (ANÖVA p = 3.8 x 10“, Tukey-Kramer p 50.05). This analysis, like that shown in
Figure 7, supports the hypothesis that GST activity is higher in organisms from a polluted
site.
Measurement of GST activity: Time Course
Figure 9 shows the GST activity data from the 30-day transplantation time-course,
normalized to total tissue mass. At t = 0 days, GST activity is 0.0439 + 0.0152
mAbs/min/g tissue and at t = 30 days, GST activity is 0.0315 + 0.0155 mAbs/min/g
tissue. There is a significant decrease in GST activity over time (two-sample t-test p =
0.0283), supporting the hypothesis that mussels that experience a decrease in pollutant
concentration will show a decrease in GST activity.
Discussion
The influx of anthropogenic pollutants from industry, agriculture, and other
human activities into coastal water has a direct effect on marine life. In this study. I
