Introduction
Anthropogenic marine pollution is a hazard for marine invertebrates inhabiting
coastal waters, especially when they live in close proximity to areas of agricultural run¬
off, or inhabit bays where such pollution may collect. In recent decades, the application
of pesticides and other organic chemicals to farmlands in California’s agricultural valleys
has increasingly affected the coastal oceanic and bay environment. Toxins such as DDT
and its breakdown products, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH’s), and polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCB's) have been found in the Monterey and San Francisco Bays (SWRCB
1996). Although concentrations of these pollutants in seawater can be measured directly.
many of these lipophilic compounds are not very soluble in water, so data analysis can be
difficult. For example, contamination can be an issue when concentrations are low, and
the methods involved in direct water sampling can be complicated and time-consuming.
An alternative method is to examine animal biomarkers. Biomarkers are defined
as organisms that tolerate and accumulate into tissues toxins from the environment,
There are many characteristics that define good biomarkers: 1) They must amplify as
well as accumulate lipophilic compounds. Organic pollutants are often hydrophobic and
they enter the food web through phytoplankton, which store energy in lipid droplets. The
lipid droplets draw lipophilic pesticides from the surrounding water. Thus, any organism,
including marine filter feeders, that gets most of its energy from phytoplankton quickly
accumulates pesticides in its tissues if these compounds are present in the water (J.
Watanabe, pers. comm.). 2) They are sessile rather than motile, ensuring that they are
exposed to contaminants in a limited area. 3) They are transplantable for the purpose of
