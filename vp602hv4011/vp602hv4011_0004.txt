The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) is an ideal marker for the presence
of organic pollutants. Glutathione S-transferase detoxifies xenobiotic compounds by
catalyzing the conjugation reaction between reduced glutathione (GSH) and any
electrophile. Consequently, GST will link any compound with an electrophilic center to
GSH, and the resulting product, a glutathione S-conjugate, will be less reactive and more
polar than the original substrate. The glutathione S-conjugate can then be
compartmentalized and exported from the cell (Karam 1998). Many organic toxins such
as DDT and its derivatives are electrophilic and act as substrates for GST. Thus,
examination of GST activity provides an integrated assessment of the exposure of
organisms to organic compounds in the environment.
Other contaminant types that are currently measured through water sampling or in
biomarker tissues may be detected by increased activity from other detoxification
pathways. For example, the presence of heavy metals, which do not induce a GST
response (Regoli and Principato 1995), may instead increase levels of metallothionein
(Bolognesi et al. 1999)
An ideal organism for study of GST activity is the bay mussel, Mytilus
galloprovincialis. In addition to being a filter-feeding accumulator, M. galloprovincialis
occurs over a wide geographical range and can tolerate high concentrations of organic
pollutants. The mussel’s digestive gland is responsible for most of the organism’s
detoxification of pollutants. Thus, the highest level of GST activity in Mytilus is found in
the digestive gland (Regoli 1998; Kaaya et al. 1999).
