hypothesis, 1 decided to examine the assumptions underlying the use of total protein
concentration as the normalization factor. If, for example, protein concentration were not
independent of site or pollutant concentration, then normalization by total protein
concentration would obscure any effect of site on GST activity.
To test this possibility, I correlated protein concentration per gram digestive gland
with mass of digestive gland for all three sites. The protein concentration is higher in M.
galloprovincialis digestive glands from Moss Landing than in those from Monterey and
Palo Alto (Figure 5), contradicting the assumption that protein concentration varies
independently of location. Because protein concentration appears to be correlated with
site and pollution level, it is inappropriate to normalize GST activity with this factor. This
figure also suggests that the mass of the digestive gland varies with location. To confirm
this observation, I compared the mass of M. galloprovincialis digestive glands to total
tissue wet weights. These data are shown in Figure 6, and indicate that for their total
tissue wet weight, mussels from Moss Landing have larger digestive glands than mussels
from Monterey or Palo Alto. Thus, the data in Figures 5 and 6 illustrate both that the
digestive gland comprises a greater percentage of total tissue, and that the total protein
concentration in the digestive gland is higher in M. galloprovincialis from a polluted site.
To analyze the GST activity in a more meaningful and appropriate way, activity
data in mAbs/min/gram digestive gland (from each aliquot tested in the
spectrophotometric assay) was multiplied by the mass of the digestive gland of each
individual (Figure 7). This manipulation gives activity for each organismâ€”that is, the
total amount of GST detoxifying power each individual mussel has in its digestive gland.
Glutathione S-transferase activity at Moss Landing (0.170 + 0.101 mAbs/min) was
