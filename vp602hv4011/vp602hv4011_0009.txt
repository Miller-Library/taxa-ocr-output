accurately the tissue mass. The size index was the product of the three dimensions of
each shell, length * width * depth. Using the same group of individuals as before, the
relationship between measured total tissue wet weight and size index (Figure 3b) shows a
strong correlation (r* = 0.96), thus the equation for the regression line can be used to
estimate tissue mass from shell dimensions in cm:
Mass (g) = 0.10791*(1*w*d) - 0.32598.
This estimation of mass was used to normalize GST activity to total tissue wet weight
(see below).
Measurement of GST activity: Location
Figure 4 shows GST activity normalized to total protein concentration. Activity
from mussels at Moss Landing was 0.359 + 0.0923 mAbs/min/mg protein (average +
standard deviation; n = 14 from each site); that from Monterey specimens was 0.398 +
0.0848 mAbs/min/mg protein; and that of Palo Alto specimens was the highest, 0.488 +
0.0153 mAbs/min/mg protein. According to single factor ANOVA, there was a
statistically significant effect of site (p = 0.0147), and a Tukey-Kramer test indicated the
Moss Landing and Palo Alto groups were statistically different (p Â« 0.05).
The data normalized in this way do not support the hypothesis that organisms
from Moss Landing, the most polluted site, have higher levels of GST activity. This
normalization was based on the convention of expressing enzyme activity in units per mg
protein (Regoli and Principato, 1995), which requires the assumption that total protein
concentrations in M. galloprovincialis digestive glands vary randomly among individuals
regardless of location. Since the normalized GST activity data do not support my
