This study compares GST activity in M. galloprovincialis from three sites varying
in pollutant levels. The sites studied were chosen based on water quality data from the
California Mussel Watch Program (SWRCB 1996). Moss Landing, at the mouth of the
Salinas River, is subject to toxin-rich agricultural run-off from the entire Salinas Valley.
Mussel Watch has found high levels of many anthropogenic pollutants such as DDT and
chlordane in the water at Moss Landing Harbor. Monterey Marina does not receive or
collect contaminated run-off. It is also likely to experience more ocean flushing with
clean water than Moss Landing Harbor. Bixbee Park, near Palo Alto in South San
Francisco Bay is not as polluted as Moss Landing (SWRCB 1995; SFEI 1999). Figure 1
shows the locations of these sites, and Figure 2 provides data on representative pollutant
concentrations at each site.
Given these toxin concentrations, I hypothesized that M. galloprovincialis from
Moss Landing would show more GST activity than mussels from Palo Alto, and that
GST activities would be lowest in Monterey Marina. I also expected that mussels
transplanted from Moss Landing into less contaminated water in the laboratory would
show a decrease in GST activity with time.
