Future studies: other enzyme systems
Unlike the other detoxification enzymes mentioned, metallothionein is not
induced by organic compounds, but instead is induced by heavy metal pollutants. For a
complete look at pollution in the coastal marine environment, metallothionein must be
included along with enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of organic pollutants. For
example, M. galloprovincialis from Monterey Marina, the location with the lowest
concentration of organic pollutants, has the lowest level of GST activity, indicating that
these mussels experience relatively low levels of organic pollutants. However, it is
thought that this population of mussels is experiencing toxic stress due to copper and
tributyltin pollution from anti-fouling paints and other byproducts of heavy boat use in
the marina. Mussels from the Monterey Marina exhibit shell morphologies (large shell
width to length ratio) that suggest they are not healthy (Mark Stephenson, pers. comm.).
and assays of other enzyme systems, which detoxify compounds other than organic
pollutants, may be useful in determining the source of this stress.
Conclusions
GST activity is higher in the digestive glands of M. galloprovincialis from water with
higher concentrations of anthropogenic organic pollutants. GST activity does decrease
when organisms are transplanted from a site with high concentrations of organic
pollutants to a less contaminated site. From these two conclusions, I believe that activity
levels of GST and other detoxification enzymes in marine organisms are useful indicators
of the general level of marine pollution. In combination with direct sampling methods,
