blotted with a kimwipe, and the tissue (not including gonad or byssal threads) was
weighed.
Preparation of samples
Each digestive gland was homogenized in 4 volumes O.05M potassium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4 (Ig tissue 2 1mL), for 15-20 seconds, using an IKA Ultra-Turrax model T
tissue homogenizer. One mL of the resulting homogenate was spun in a refrigerated
microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4° C and 10,000 g. The supernatant was divided into two
parts, one for measurement of protein concentration, which was kept on ice for up to one
week, and one for the GST activity assay, which was used immediately,
Measurement of GST activity
The homogenate sample, to which 0.2mM dithiothreitol and 0.25 ug/mL Pefabloc (a
protease inhibitor, Boehringer Mannheim) were added, was kept on ice. The conversion
of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and reduced glutathione (GSH) to form oxidized
glutathione was measured at 340 nm on a Shimadzu UV-160 1 spectrophotometer,
following the method of Lima and Storey (1993). The spectrophotometer was connected
to a PC and data were collected using the Kinetics software provided by the
manufacturer. To begin, 3 mL cuvettes were filled with 2.0 mL of assay buffer (0.05 M
potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 2mM GSH and 2mM CDNB). A 60-second time course
was run at 20 °C to determine the background activity in the absence of GST. To initiate
the assay, 50 uL of the homogenate was added to the cuvette and activity was measured
for another 60 seconds. GST activity was determined after subtracting the background
