comparison studies. 4) They are naturally abundant and occur over a wide geographical
range as well as over a wide range of pollutant concentrations.
In the past, water quality monitoring programs have used assay techniques on the
tissues of biomarker organisms to determine directly the amount of specific pollutants at
a monitoring site. For example, the State of California Mussel Watch program and the
San Francisco Estuary Institute use tissues of native or transplanted bivalves to assess the
abundance and distribution of several heavy metals and organic toxins along the
California coast (SWRCB 1996; SFEI 1999).
Another way to use biomarkers to determine relative contaminant levels in the
marine environment is to examine an organismâ€™s biochemical response to the toxicity of
the contaminant. By observing the activity of enzymes involved in detoxification, a more
integrated measure of toxin exposure can be obtained than by assaying directly for
individual chemicals. Specific chemical tests may not find all of the toxins present in
seawater or biomarker tissue. Thus, by studying a detoxification pathway in a biomarker
organism, one can evaluate the effect of all pollutants of a particular type (e.g. organics)
on an organism.
There are a variety of detoxification pathways that biomarker organisms may use
to metabolize the organic compounds common in agricultural run-off. These include the
mixed-function oxidase system, which includes the cytochrome p450 group (Livingstone
et al. 1989); flavin-containing monooxygenase (Schlenk and Buhrer 1989).
multixenobiotic transport proteins (Cornwall et al. 1995), and glutathione S-transferase
(Fitzpatrick et al. 1995).
