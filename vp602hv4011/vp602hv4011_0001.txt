Abstract
In order to measure organic pollutants and heavy metals in coastal waters.
previous studies have directly assayed for these compounds in tissues of bioaccumulators
such as Mytilus galloprovincialis. In contrast, this study measured the activity of the
detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the digestive gland of M.
galloprovincialis as a bioindicator of the state of organic pollution at three sites in the
San Francisco and Monterey Bays with varying pollutant levels. Glutathione S¬
transferase activity was measured through the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
(CDNB) to reduced glutathione (GSH) to form CDNB-SH, at a wavelength of 340 nm.
The activity data were collected in milliabsorbance units/min and were normalized by
dividing by total tissue wet weight. Activity was highest in M. galloprovincialis from the
most polluted site, Moss Landing (0.0573 + 0.0226 mAbs/min/g tissue), intermediate in
specimens from the Palo Alto site (0.0327 + 0.0140 mAbs/min/g tissue), and lowest in
samples from the least polluted site, Monterey Marina (0.0228 + 0.0068 mAbs/min/g
tissue, ANÖVA p = 3.8 x 10°). Organisms from Moss Landing also have greater
digestive gland masses per total tissue mass and have higher protein concentrations than
organisms from less polluted sites. Mytilus galloprovincialis was transplanted from
polluted water at Moss Landing into pristine seawater and GST activity was measured
over 30 days. There was a significant decrease in GST activity with reduced exposure to
organic pollutants.
