Figure 8. Activity normalized to total tissue mass. Each vertical bar is the average of the
activities of 14 individuals from each site. Sites are as above. Error bars are standard
deviations from the mean. Shared letters (A, B) indicate groups whose means are not
significantly different (Tukey-Kramer p2 0.05).
Figure 9. GST Activity: Time Course. GST activity is normalized to total tissue wet
weight.
