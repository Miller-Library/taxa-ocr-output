activity from that of the homogenate. Activity was expressed in milliabsorbance
units/minute/g total tissue and was normalized in three ways: with respect to total protein
concentration; the whole digestive gland; and total tissue mass of the organism (see
results below).
Total protein concentration
Total protein in the homogenate sample was assayed using the Coomassie Plus Protein
Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The homogenates were diluted 20x with distilled water to
adjust protein concentration to within the working range of the system. The standard
used was bovine serum albumin.
Measurement of GST activity: Time Course
To test how GST activity levels change as mussels experience a decrease in concentration
of organic toxins, fifty individuals were transplanted from Moss Landing Harbor into the
flow-through tanks at Hopkins Marine Station. These mussels were acclimated to the
local water as described above. A group of individuals was removed from the tanks and
GST activity was measured at t = 0 days, 4, 10, 15, and 30 days.
Results
Estimation of total tissue wet weight
The correlation between tissue wet weight and shell length is shown in Figure 3a.
The râ€™ value (0.71) was low, so I included other morphological parameters to create a size
index more representative of the volume of a mussel shell, and thus to characterize more
