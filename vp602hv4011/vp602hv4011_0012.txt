chose to examine an aspect of that effect—one of many biochemical pathways that
metabolize those chemicals—as an analytical tool to determine the level of pollution in
coastal marine habitats. Currently, testing for both organic chemicals and heavy metals is
conducted in two ways: direct water sampling, and measurement of pollutant
concentration in bioaccumulator tissue.
Most organic pesticides are lipophilic and sparingly soluble in water, thus the
direct sampling method sometimes used by regional monitoring programs (SFEI, 1999) is
complicated and costly due to the low concentrations of pollutants in the water.
Lipophilic compounds accumulate in filter-feeding organisms, so higher concentrations
may be found in the tissues of filter-feeders like mussels and clams, and an alternative
testing method for organic compounds uses the tissues of these filter-feeders. This
method of testing provides specific information on concentrations of individual pollutants
accumulated by the organism, but because pollutants may accumulate at different rates
(Bjork and Gilek 1997), the relative concentrations of accumulated toxins in tissues may
not represent the actual concentrations of those tissues in the surrounding environment.
An alternative to these direct methods is to study enzymatic detoxification
pathways to gauge organic stress in marine bioaccumulators. There are a variety of
enzymes involved in detoxification. In addition to GST, some of these enzymatic
pathways, such as cytochrome p450 and multixenobiotic transfer proteins have been
considered as biomarkers to study toxic stress on an organism. Most studies on
cytochrome p450 have been performed on fish or other vertebrates, although Livingstone
et al. (1989) have assayed for cytochrome p450 activity using a fluorescence assay based
on ethoxy-o-deethylase.
