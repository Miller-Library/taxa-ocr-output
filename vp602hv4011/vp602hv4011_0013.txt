The multixenobiotic transport system has been studied in M. californianus.
Cornwall et al. (1995) determined that moderately hydrophobic pesticides such as dacthal
and chlorbenside are substrates for the multixenobiotic transport protein, but extremely
hydrophobic pesticides such as DDT and its derivatives are not. Thus, studying GST--
which does detoxify these hydrophobic pesticides-in conjunction with multixenobiotic
transport protein activity, would provide a more complete illustration of the concentration
of most types of toxic pesticides in coastal waters. Furthermore, examining a variety of
detoxification pathways in several aquatic organisms linked in the food web would show
the course of toxins from phytoplankton into higher trophic levels.
The results from three different sites show a significant correlation between GST
activity in the digestive gland of M. galloprovincialis and organic pollutant levels. The
results from the time-course transplantation experiment indicate that GST activity is
dependent on the ambient concentration of organic pollutants.
This study uncovered unexpected correlations between the pollutant level of the
three sites and both mass of the digestive gland and total protein concentration in the
gland. That mussels from Moss Landing, the most polluted site, have larger digestive
glands per total tissue wet weight and more total protein per gram digestive gland
suggests that these two factors are themselves responsive to pollutant levels. The
digestive gland is the primary detoxifying organ in M. galloprovincialis, and it may
contain several detoxification pathways that are induced by high pollutant concentrations.
Thus, the total protein concentration in the digestive gland would increase with more
pollutants in the water, and the digestive gland may itself respond by increasing its size to
increase its detoxification power. Thus, a very simple estimate of the pollution in a
