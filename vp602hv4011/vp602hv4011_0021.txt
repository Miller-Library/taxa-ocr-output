Figure 1. Map of study sites. (Pederson 2000)
Figure 2a. Anthropogenic organic pollutants in Mytilus tissue. Locations are PA: Palo
Alto, ML: Moss Landing, and MM: Monterey Marina. The y-axis shows concentrations
of accumulated organic chemicals in ppb, or ug/L, from O to 2000 (SWRCB 1996; SFEI
1999)
Figure 2b. Anthropogenic organic pollutants in Mytlius tissue. Same locations and data
as Figure 2a. The scale on the y-axis is increased by a factor of 10 (SWRCB 1996; SFEI
1999)
Figure 3a. Total tissue wet weight (g) vs. shell length(mm).
Figure 3b. Total tissue wet weight (g) vs. size index (cmâ€™) (see text).
Figure 4. GST activity normalized to total protein concentration. Each vertical bar is the
average of the activities of 14 individuals from each site. Sites are MM: Monterey
Marina, ML: Moss Landing, and PA: Palo Alto. Error bars are standard deviations from
the mean. Shared letters (A, B, AB) indicate groups whose means are not significantly
different (Tukey-Kramer p 2 0.05).
Figure 5. Total protein concentration (mg/mL) vs. mass digestive gland (g).
Figure 6. Mass digestive gland (g) vs. total tissue wet weight (g).
Figure 7. GST activity normalized to whole digestive gland. Each vertical bar is the
average of the activities of 14 individuals from each site. Sites are as above. Error bars
are standard deviations from the mean. Shared letters (A, B) indicate groups whose
means are not significantly different (Tukey-Kramer p 2 0.05).
