Clustering occurs in areas which receive some shade and some
protection from direct wave action. Animals disperse on a
rising tide. Reclustering occurs during tidal ebb while
rocks are still wet, and takes place both day and night. A
cluster varying in size from 22 to 44 individuals occupied an
average of 15 sq. in. (range 8 - 20 sq. in.) each day over a
32 day period. Daily shifts in cluster position occurred;
total cumulative area occupied by the cluster in 32 days
was 77 sq. in. Only 17 members of the original cluster re¬
mained after 32 days, while a total of 22 new members entered.

The limpet Acmaea digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833, is a
common inhabitant of the high intertidal rocky shores of the
North American Pacific coast. Populations of A. digitalis
are not randomly distributed but are often clustered into
groups in limited areas with comparatively few solitary
limpets on the surrounding regions. No specific studies of
clustering behavior have been made on A. digitalis, although
Frank (1966) mentions the occurrence of aggregations in de¬
pressions and other irregularities in the rock. Abe (1932)
studied the behavior of clusters of the limpet <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea dorsuosa : Exact'>Acmaea

period of two years and his results showed mainly seasonal
variations.

The present study, conducted at Hopkins Marine Station
on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California was carried out
to provide a better picture of the clustering behavior of
A. digitalis. On April 25, 1966, fourteen clusters were
placed under observation. Eleven of these persisted only
two to three days and only three clusters remained intact
with regard to the area occupied and members present for a
period of a month. This paper documents the activity of the
largest of the three remaining clusters.
For present purposes a cluster is defined as an aggre¬
gation of three or more animals, each within one centimeter
of its nearest neighbor. Animals farther than one centi¬
meter from the closest member of a cluster were not included
in the cluster. The clusters studied were located on the
east face of a large island of granite rock some eighty feet
offshore. Waves broke on the opposite side of the island.
rolled around and surged below the limpets in a narrow
channel, splashing them thoroughly at high water. The par-
ticular cluster studied was located six feet above 0.O water
level. No macroscopic algae were present in the area and the
microscopic algae seemed evenly distributed. The rock sur-
face was fairly smooth with a fold or crack rising up the
center. The upper end of this fold, where the cluster
studied was located, presented a shallow depression on the
2ed
Carol S. Millard
rock face which became shaded between 1:30 and 3:00 P.M.
The location offered some protection from the prevailing
winds.
To facilitate the plotting of cluster position on the
rock a grid of red dots was painted at 1½ inch intervals on
the rock surface. Within this grid the positions of indi¬
viduals could be designated with good accuracy. The limpets
present on April 25, 1966 were marked with India ink to
distinguish them from each other and from the original
members. The limpets were observed daily at low water for
a week and their positions mapped at each observation.
Thereafter, they were observed at intervals of one to
seven days. Several attempts were made to chart the move¬
ments of the limpets at rising and falling tides. For
these observations pencil notes were made on x-ray film
with the emulsion removed and surface roughened, facili¬
tating writing underwater. The water invariably became so
rough that plotting the movements of the cluster throughout
an entire tidal cycle was impossible.
General observation of the cluster showed that the
limpets move when they are being wetted by the splash of
incoming waves on a rising or falling tide. Within a half
hour after they have first been splashed, the majority of
26
Carol S. Millard
the limpets begin to move upward and laterally on the rock.
In this reaction, corroborated by Miller (1966), the lower
limpets begin to move before the higher ones; the low ani¬
mals are more frequently and heavily splashed. Once moye¬
ment has started the animals crawl upwards and laterally for
distances of two to six feet. Thus at high water the cluster
is dispersed. The animals remain more or less active while
the tide is in. As the water level recedes again, they tend
to regroup themselves into a cluster, in approximately the
position occupied by the previous cluster.
The first question posed was: does the cluster occupy
the same amount of space and the same area on the rock
consistently? To answer this question the daily positions
and areas occupied by the cluster at low water were compared
for successive days (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be seen
that the cluster shifted its position from day to day. The
area occupied averaged 15 sq. in. and varied from 8 to 20 sg.
in. The cumulative total area of rock surface occupied by
the cluster during the month of observation was 77 sg. in.
(see Figure 1,u). There was always some overlap between the
positions occupied by the cluster on successive days. This
overlap ranged from 37% to 75% of the total area occupied at
the time of observation (see Table 1). New area, not
276
Carol S. Millard
previously inhabited during the period of observation, was
added as the cluster changed daily in its shape and location
on the rock.
Another question to be answered concerns cluster member¬
ship (Figures 3 and 4). The membership of the cluster varied
from day to day as animals entered the cluster, remain asso¬
ciated with it for a period, and then either left the area
or remained nearby but not actually in the cluster. Later.
some of these limpets rejoined the cluster. Thus, it could
be observed that the turnover and variation in cluster mem¬
bership was something occurring in a relatively constant
group. Only a few unmarked limpets entered the cluster area
after the first week, during which eleven newcomers joined
the cluster. In the month that followed, fewer than ten un-
marked limpets joined. Two animals were observed to wander
one to four feet from the cluster area. The closer of the
two returned after five days; the other did not return.
Observations of Acmaea digitalis in several different
locations around the Monterey Peninsula indicate that, in
general, clusters are found in more protectéd areas. They
tend to occur in spots which receive more shade than the sur¬
rounding rock face due to a slight depression in the rock
barely noticeable when the full sun is on the whole rock face,
22

On the rock island where most of this study was carried out,
between 1:30 and 3:00 P.M. the cluster areas would be out¬
lined by a shade pattern which covered them but left the
rest of the rock in full sunlight. Clustering also tends
to occur on surfaces at right angles to the sea which receive
some surge and splash from waves but do not bear the full
brunt of the breakers. In areas directly exposed to wave
action Acmaea digitalis have not been observed to cluster,
although their populations may be very dense. Here they
remain randomly dispersed, although small, temporary clusters
of three to six animals may aggregate in a crack or depres¬
sion in the rock.
The factors stimulating clustering are not fully
known. Animals cluster when the tide is out and disperse
when the tide is in, at night as well as during the day,
thus light does not seem to be a direct and immediate
causal factor. Tide level and wave action appear to play
an important role. The limpets recluster when they are
still being splashed on an ebbing tide and the area is still
totally wet, as though the frequency of splash and the amount
of water passing over them were being measured. The fact
that the animals recluster when the rock is wet and may do
so at night seems to indicate that clustering is not similar
29.
Carol S. Millard
to the phenomenon of aggregation in sow bugs which keep
moving until they end up in the dampest and shadiest spot
available (Allee 1926) It is also difficult to look at
clustering as a purely random occurrence because it is seen
that limpets return to a fairly stable cluster area.
Some observations made suggest that the height of the
sea at high water and the degree of wave action may influ¬
ence the height on the rocks where clustering occurs,
Toward the end of the month that the cluster shown in Figure
1 was observed, the weather grew progressively more stormy,
and wave action increased. During this period the cluster
rose in its position on the rock (Fig. 1), gradually occupy¬
ing a higher area. Also, the cluster underwent progressive
fragmentation with time. This behavior recalls the finding
of Abe (1932) that clustering is seasonal, and that the
clusters of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. dorsuosa break</span> up shortly after the winter
storms begin.
The means by which animals are able to find their ways
back to the cluster area are not clear. There is a possibil¬
ity that mucous trails are involved. Another animal which
occurs slightly above A. digitalis in the intertidal region,
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Littorina planaxis : Exact'>Littorina planaxis</span> Philippi, has been proven to follow mucous
trails left on rocks by members of its own or other species
2.
Carol S. Millard
(Miyamoto, 1964; Peters, 1964). Whatever the mechanism, it
may be similar to that involved in "homing" in limpets.
During the month that the clusters were observed four of the
animals were seen to return to the same exact location and
orientation at successive low tides for period of two or
three days. They then changed resting spots and repeated
this behavior for several more days. Homing in some A.
digitalis was also noticed by Miller (1966).
SUMMARY
Acmaea digitalis populations often cluster on inter-
tidal rocks at low tide. Clustering occurs in areas which
receive some shade and some protection from direct wave
action. Animals disperse on a rising tide. Reclustering
occurs during tidal ebb while rocks are still wet, and takes
place both day and night.
A cluster varying in size from 22 to 44 individuals
occupied an average of 15 sq. in. (range 8 - 20 sq. in.)
each day over a 32 day period. Daily shifts in cluster
position occurred; total cumulative area occupied was 77 sq.
in.
Only 17 members of the original cluster remained after
32 days while a total of 22 new members entered.
