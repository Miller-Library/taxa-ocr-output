Nuttallina californica. They have been found to show
much activity during the hours of high tide, occurring
during the night (Smith, 1974). Boolootian (1951)
found them to feed on various red and green algae such
as; Gelidium spp., Ulva spp., and Ectocarpus spp.
The impetus for this comparative study of lipid
and carbohydrate stores was a test of the following
hypothesis; differences in habit and habitat are reflected
in the levels of tissue lipid and glycogen. Using
movement as an indication of active feeding it was hypoth-
esized that the more sedentary Nuttallina californica,
which has prolonged periods of inactivity, may have higher or
lower lipid and carbohydrate stores than those of
Mopalia muscosa, which seems to move and feed more fre-
quently.
Materials & Methods
Nuttallina californica of relatively the same size
were collected from similar habitats at Mussel Point
near the Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove and
at Point Pinos on the Monterey Peninsula. Mopalia
muscosa were collected from Mission Point in Carmel Bay.
Animals were collected during the last week of April
and the month of May, 1974.
Immediately after collection the animals were
