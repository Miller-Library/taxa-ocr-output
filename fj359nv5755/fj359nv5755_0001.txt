Lipid and Glycogen Levels in the Tissues
of Two West Coast Chitons;
Mopalia muscosa and Nuttallina californica
ABSTRACT
Analysis was done on the foot, gut, digestive gland, and
gonad using the methanol-ethyl ether method for lipids
and the phenol-sulfuric acid method for glycogen.
Species differences were found only in the foot tissues.
Female Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846) had a lower percentage
of lipid in the foot tissue than did female Nuttallina-
californica (Reeve, 1847). Comparing both sexes, N.
muscosa was found to have a higher level of glycogen in
the foot tissuethan N. californica. In the tissues of
both species studied lipids are quantitatively the more
important storage materials. Original paper containing
full findings is in library of Hopkins Marine Station.
