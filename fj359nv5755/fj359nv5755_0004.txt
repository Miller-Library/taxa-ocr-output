brought into the laboratory, weighed and then dissected
to obtain the foot, gut, digestive gland, and gonad.
The gut was extended in a dissecting pan and a bent
dissecting probe was run the length of it squeezing out
the contents to insure that only the gut tissue was
analyzed. The tissues were then placed in separate
crucibles and dried in an oven at 75 degrees centigrade
for 24 hours. Upon completion of drying the tissues were
kept in a desiccator until the analysis could be made.
Dried foot tissue was ground into a fine powder using
a mortar and pestle and the other tissues were broken
into fine pieces using a dissecting probe and the end
of a small test tube. Lipids were extracted using the
methanol-ethyl ether method of Freeman, Lindgren, Ng,
and Nichols (1957).
After the lipids had been extracted from the tissue
it was digested in 10 ml of hot 10% trichloroacetic acid
for 30 minutes. The supernatant was then analyzed for
carbohydrate content using the phenol-sulfuric acid
method of Dubois, Giles, Hamilton, Rebers and Smith
(1956) with reference to a glucose standard curve.
Therefore, all carbohydrate levels are expressed in terms
of glucose.
The entire organ of each animal was used for
analysis. Therefore, percent of tissue dry weight is
also percent of organ dry weight.
