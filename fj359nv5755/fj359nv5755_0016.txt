gonad weight is expressed in milligrams. N.R. means
weights were not recorded.
Table 4
Lipid and carbohydrate levels, expressed in
percent of dry tissue weight are shown for the digest-
ive gland, gut, gonad, and foot of five male Nuttallina
californica analyzed. Mean values are also shown.
Wet body weight and dried gonad weight for each animal
are also given; body weight is expressed in grams and
gonad weight is expressed in milligrams.
Table 5
Data from comparison of lipid content of tissues
using the t-test is shown. The table shows tissues
from the two types of chitons being compared, also
the sample size n, mean value,X, of each tissue;
standard deviation, S.D., of each tissue; the t value
arrived at and the probability, p, of the two tissues
being significantly different.
