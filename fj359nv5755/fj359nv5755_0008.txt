R. Tenold Storage Reserves In Two Chitons
Monterey Bay chitons, Nuttallina californica
(Reeve, 1847) and Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846).
A difference between species in storage reserves of
2.
lipids and carbohydrates due to an observed
difference in activity and feeding frequency was
investigated.
The foot tissue was found to be different between
species in terms of lipids and carbohydrates.
Other tissues were not significantly different.
4.
Lipids are quantitatively the more important storage
materials.
The levels of these two storage substances was
5.
found to be extremely variable from organism to
organism in both species studied.
