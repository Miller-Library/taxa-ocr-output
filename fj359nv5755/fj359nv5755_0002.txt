Introduction
Of the several species of Polyplacophora found in
the intertidal area of Monterey County California,
Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847) and Mopalia muscosa
(Gould, 1846) are two of the most common. The habitat,
behavior, and food of these two species differ greatly.
Nuttallina californica is a small chiton, usually
no longer than 3.7 cm which is usually restricted to
the middle intertidal of fairly exposed rocky shores
(Ricketts & Calvin, 1962). They are often found in small
furrows and crevices in the rocks and appear to lead a
rather sedentary life. From personal observation some
have been found not to move at all during a 48 hour period.
They have been found to feed mostly on red algae in their
immediate vicinity. These include Endocladia muricata,
Gigartina papillata, and Rhodoglossum spp. They are also
known to feed on the green alga Cladophora trichotoma
(Nishi, 1974).
Mopalia muscosa is the larger of the two species
and is in the size range of 7.6-10.2 cm. They are found
in more protected areas such as; tidepools, attached to
the underside of rocks, or on top of rocks under a covering of
Pelvetia fastigiata or Fucus furcatus (Legard & Andrus,
1974). Their activity is more pronounced than that of
