difference was found to be significant to the 97.5%
confidence limit. Mean lipid content of the foot of
female Nuttallina california was 8.7% of the dry weight
of the tissue. This is to be compared to a value of
4.5% for the same tissue in the female Mopalia muscosa.
This finding would tend to confirm the original hypothesis
however no significant difference could be found between
any of the other tissues.
Looking at the carbohydrate levels the only
significant difference between the two species was found
in the foot tissue of both sexes. These findings were
subjected to a two-tailed t-test and were found to surpass
the 99% confidence limit. The mean value for carbohydrates
in the foot of female and male Mopalia muscosa was 7.0%
and 4.3% respectively. These levels are to be compared
to 1.6% and 1.7% for female and male Nuttallina californica.
These findings show the foot tissue of M.muscosa as a
prominent storage site for carbohydrates as compared to
the other tissues in both species. It is to be remembered
that M. muscosa is a far more active animal than N.
californica.
The findings also showed intraspecies differences
between females and males concerning lipid and carbohyÂ¬
drate content of the gonads. Lipid content of the ovary
was much higher than that of the testis, probably reflecting
