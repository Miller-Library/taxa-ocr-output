Results & Discussion
Ten organisms from each species, five of each sex,
were analyzed. The results of lipid and carbohydrate
levels for female Mopalia muscosa are shown in Table 1,
male M. muscosa are shown in Table 2, female Nuttallina
californica are shown in Table 3, and male N. californÂ¬
ica are shown in Table 4. The mean level of carbohydrates
for both species, standard error for each tissue and
the range between individuals are shown in Figure 1.
Figure 2 shows the same information for lipid levels
in both species.
The findings show a great variability in lipid and
carbohydrate levels between individual organisms within
each species. It has been shown by Giese and Araki (1962)
that the chemical composition of tissues does change
depending on what stage of the reproductive cycle the
animal is in. This study was only conducted over a five
week period and individuals analyzed were of differing
gonadal developement. Dry weights of the gonad from
each individual were recorded but there was no apparent
relationship between gonadal size and tissue storage levels.
In answering the original hypothesis the only
significant difference found between the two species in
terms of lipid stores was in that of the foot tissue of
the females of both species. Using the t-test this
