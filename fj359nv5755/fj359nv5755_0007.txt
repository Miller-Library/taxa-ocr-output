R. Tenold Storage Reserves In Two Chitons

the large amount of storage reserves deposited in the
eggs to be used in developement. In Mopalia muscosa
the level of carbohydrates is significantly higher at
the 95% confidence limit level in the testis than it is
in the ovary. The possible reason for this difference
is not apparent. However when the tissues are corrected
for their difference in lipid content there is not a
significant difference between the carbohydrate levels
of the ovary and testis. The results of the "t-test
for significant difference between mean values is
presented in Tables 5 and 6.
As in other species of Polyplacophora studied;
Katharina tunicata, Cryptochiton stelleri (Giese, 1969)
and Mopalia hindsii (Giese & Araki, 1962) Mopalia
muscosa and Nuttallina californica seem to have most
of their storage reserves in the form of lipids, and
their carbohydrate stores are much lower. This trend
probably indicates a fast overturning carbohydrate reserve
used for immediate energy and a more stable lipid reserve
drawn on for the production of gametes and in periods
of starvation.
Summary
1. Lipid and carbohydrate levels were determined in
the foot, gut, gonad, and digestive gland of two
