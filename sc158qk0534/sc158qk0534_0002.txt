Introduction
Previous research in neuroscience has concentrated on studying the nervous
system at the single cell level. However, the question remains, how do these single
neurons and their intricate synaptic connections network together to allow complex
integrative functions of the nervous system? Several advances in this search have come
from researching sensory system integration.
In the visual system, integration of the attributes of an object, such as color, size and
depth, allows us to perceive the object as a unified whole. Amazingly, each of the
different aspects of an object is processed in different regions of the brain. Perceiving a
single object despite localized analysis of its features is referred to as the binding
problem. One proposed solution to the binding problem is synchronization.
Synchronization is defined as the locking or entrainment of the phases of a neural
population with other geographically isolated neural populations (Varela et al., 2001). In
the olfactory system of insects, it has been shown that disruption of synchronization
deteriorates odor discrimination (Stopfer et al., 1997), thus proving synchronization is
necessary for recognition of odor. Synchronization has not yet been proven necessary in
other sensory systems. However, a relatively new technique, in vivo two-photon calcium
imaging, has allowed scientists to witness synchronization in other sensory systems first
hand via real-time monitoring of neural networks (Konnerth, 2003).
The advantage of Caâ€œ imaging is that it allows for the real-time analyses of both
individual cells and neural networks at the same time. Calcium imaging makes use of the
fact that in living cells, calcium influx is often associated with depolarization due to
action potentials. Hence, one can observe neuron activity through calcium flow. This
