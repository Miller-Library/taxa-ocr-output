hypothermic shock. They were then paralyzed with 75mL of curare injected near the tail.
The zebrafish were then placed in a petri dish with a specially designed chamber and
secured with pins. Under a dissection microscope, the brain plate was removed with
sharpened titanium tweezers from a suture just below the cerebellum to expose the optic
tectum (Fig. 1B). Only one side of the optic tectum was exposed to minimize damage to
the brain and reduce dissection time. Throughout the dissection, zebrafish were immersed
with 75% Hank's solultion (7.4pH buffered with 2.6g/L HEPES, stored at 4°C). After the
optic tectum was exposed, the gills were perfused with 75% Hank's solution using a
custom-designed setup (Fig. 1A).
The membrane permeable fluorescent calcium dye Fluo3 was used for the
microinjection. The dye was dissolved in DMSO with 20% pluronic to yield a lOmM
stock solution and then further diluted in PBS to a final concentration of ImM (Konnerth,
2003). A micromanipulator was used to insert a glass micropipette into the superficial
layers of the optic tectum. Injections were performed between 10-40ms, using the
smallest duration that could expel dye from tip, and about 7psi. Calcium recordings
started 30-60 minutes after the injection.
Calcium Imaging - Zebrafish were placed into a similar perfusion setup as under the
dissecting microscope, allowing 75% Hanks Solution to pass through their gills. Oxygen
was slowly bubbled into the Hank's solution. The confocal microscope and Fluo View
software were used to visualize the calcium dye. Aperture was set to 1 or 2, and laser was
set to 3 or 6, depending on the amount of dye present. Äfter focusing on an injection site,
a time series was taken in darkness at two frames per second for 60-120 seconds to
