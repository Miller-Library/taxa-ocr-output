processes in individual dendrites and neurons closer to the time of stimulus that can
explain the wide field responses.
As with all new techniques, calcium imaging in adult zebrafish can benefit from
some improvements. Recordings were interrupted by quick, irregular movements of the
zebrafish that made following individual dendrites throughout a time series difficult. We
have yet to resolve the cause of this movement, but a completely stable fish will allow
more accurate recording and analysis of activity. This experiment analyzed dendrites
randomly selected from the area of recording, which was in turn determined by sites of
injection. Being able to inject dye more evenly into the optic tectum and to identify the
same regions between fish will enable recording of reproducible results that can be
mapped to determine integrative circuitry. Finally, with these improvements in place,
different patterns of light stimuli can be tested to elicit specific relationships between
stimulus and neuronal coding in the optic tectum adult zebrafish.
Conclusion
A calcium imaging and perfusion technique was developed to study dendritic
activity in the adult zebrafish optic tectum. Under a fixed-interval light flash stimulus,
dendrites showed a different activity pattern that distinguished them from background
activity and suggest integrative synchronous firing of neurons. However, periodicity of
the response was not locked to the light flashes. This technique can be used together with
electrophysiology to resolve pathways of higher order visual processing in the optic
tectum.
