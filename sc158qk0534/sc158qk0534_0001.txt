Abstract
Zebrafish has long been a model organism for studying the visual system. They have a
similar visual system as higher vertebrates but lack a visual cortex. Instead, higher order
visual processing occurs in the optic tectum. Previous studies of the zebrafish visual
system have used mainly electrophysiological techniques to record wide field responses.
We have developed a new technique for perfusing and calcium imaging of live adult
zebrafish. This technique allows for simultaneously recording of response in large
neuronal populations and activity in neuronal processes as small as 2-5um. Zebrafish was
immersed in and perfused over the gills with physiological 75% Hank's solution in a
custom-built perfusion system. Optic tectum of zebrafish was exposed in a dissection and
microinjected with fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo3. Confocal microscope was used to
image calcium activity in dendrites in the optic tectum receiving input from the retina. A
train of light flashes given in five-second intervals was used as stimulus. Time series of
responses were recorded at two frames per second. Graphical analysis reveals that
dendritic responses to stimuli showed different activity levels and oscillation patterns
compared with control, but responses were not time-locked to stimuli. Responses varied
between dendrites, with both excitation and inhibition evident. Neighboring dendrites
showed a higher correlation in activity, suggesting synchronization of neuronal
populations in response to light stimuli.
