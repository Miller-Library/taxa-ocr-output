technique has been successfully applied by Neill et al. in 2005 to characterize the
direction selectivity of neurons in the optic tectum of Zebrafish. Zebrafish are a model
organism to study visual system integration because they are easy to maintain, and, as
vertebrates, have a similar eye structure to mammals. Unlike mammals, they lack a visual
cortex, where more complex visual integration occurs, simplifying the study of basic
visual integration.
In zebrafish, visual information such as movement, shape, and color are analyzed
and integrated in the optic tectum. Single-cell and multi-cell recordings using
electrophysiology have shown that when humans, as well as other vertebrates, are
presented with a repeated stimuli delivered at a fixed interval, a specific response follows
(Takasaka, 1985). One aim of this study was to observe this response to a repeated light
stimulus at the single cell and network levels simultaneously, using calcium imaging to
record from a living and functional adult zebrafish brain.
Despite zebrafish being recognized as a model organism to study the visual system,
most work has been done on zebrafish larvae. In order to image adult zebrafish neural
networks in vivo using calcium imaging, a new method was required. In order to achieve
our goal of recording the response to a light train in vivo, our first aim was to develop a
method that allowed for imaging in adult zebrafish using confocal microscopy and
calcium sensitive dyes.
