alive during the procedure but we were also able to observe and record optic tectal
activity under the confocal microscope (Fig. 2).
Imaging of brain slices revealed that we could not focus on cell bodies of optic
tectal neurons, which were deeper in the optic tectum, because their fluorescence was
obscured by background activity on the surface. Instead, the long, narrow structures that
were imaged with FMI-43XM were axons and dendrites (Fig. 1C). This test indicated
that, using Fluo3 dye, we successfully imaged calcium activity in the dendrites.
Calcium imaging revealed two particular types of activity. The first was
synchronous activity in local populations, where fluorescence in a large region increased
and decreased as a group (Fig. 2A). The second was individual dendritic activity that
stood out from background activity (Fig. 2B).
Graphical analysis showed that activity patterns of dendrites were different when
light stimulus was delivered, some displaying elevated activity while others were
depressed. Oscillation period also varied between flash and no flash trials in the same
dendrite, and between dendrites, although periods were not time locked to stimulus.
Neighboring dendrites showed more similar activities than dendrites from different
regions. (Fig. 3)
Discussion
By using calcium imaging with the confocal microscope, we have developed a
method to image in vivo neuronal activity in adult zebrafish optic tectum. Other
experiments on zebrafish have used electrophysiology to record overall retinal and tectal
responses to light, and calcium imaging to study development of the visual system in
larvae (Niell, 2005). Taking a step further, our perfusion system allowed us to keep adult
