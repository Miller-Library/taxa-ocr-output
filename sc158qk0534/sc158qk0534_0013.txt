Fig. 1. Experimental methods. (A) Life support system: From left- 75% Hank's entered
zebrafish mouth via drip chamber and tubing. The solution passed through the gills of
curare paralyzed fish. Excess solution was pumped out through a second tube. (B) Sites
of dissection and microinjection: dark grey ovals represent optic tectum and light grey
oval represents cerebellum. (C) Brain slice: Calcium imaging of a slice of the optic
tectum injected with FMI-43XM dye. Visible structures are input axons and optic tectum
dendrites in the integrative region. Image was taken with 100x water immersion lens.
(D) Data analysis: Circles indicate dendrites of 2-4um that were selected for graphical
analysis. Image was taken with 40x water immersion lens.
Figure 2. Time sequences reveal synchronization of neural populations. FluoView
software was used to record fluorescence at 2fps. Light stimulus was light flash for one
second followed by darkness for four seconds. (A) Sample sequence of four frames
spanning two seconds. Boxes indicate region of synchronous dendrite activity. (B,C)
Under the same experimental conditions as (A), these time sequences were taken at a
different injection site in the same optic tectum. As in (A), several dendrites are in phase
with one another. In (B), circled bright spots indicates what was defined as a dendrite.
Figure 3. Dendritic activity with and without light stimulus. Each graph represents the
same dendrite recorded with a flash (blue) and without a flash (red). In flash trials, first
flash was given at 20 seconds. Graphed from data recorded at 2fps, and smoothed by
rolling average of 3 consecutive data points. (A) and (B) are two dendrites from the same
region of the optic tectum. (C) and (D) neighboring dendrites from a different region of
the same optic tectum as in (A) and (B).
