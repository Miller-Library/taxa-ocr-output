series, and individual neuronal activity. While overall levels of activity were similar in
the flash and dark conditions, graphical analyses of specific dendrites in each recording
showed that activity did vary between the two conditions. Compared to the dark trial,
each dendrite showed different levels and periods of activity when a light train was
presented (Fig. 3). It is important to note that the peaks and troughs in the graphs do not
represent action potentials as in traditional electrophysiological recordings, as dendrites
do not necessarily fire action potentials in response to depolarization. Rather, they
represent the summation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the retina. And it is the
integration of all these potentials as they spread to the neuron cell body that determines if
the neuron can fire an action potential.
Comparing two dendrites in the same time series recording, for example between
figures 3A and 3B, or between figures 3C and 3D, similar patterns of activity can be
observed. For example, in the presence of light flashes, the dendrite in figure 3A showed
elevated activity from 15-35 seconds, which was also apparent in dendrite in figure 3B.
However, comparing figures 3A and 3C, two dendrites that were further apart, the levels
and periods of activity were completely different. These results show that dendrites in
close proximity tended to receive similar input. While we could not determine whether
the dendrites were receiving input from the same axons, or the exact location of the
postsynaptic cell bodies, this correlation between neighboring dendrites suggests that
populations of neurons were stimulated in a similar manner by the light. Each of these
populations may respond to a specific aspect of a visual stimulus. Furthermore, this
correlation can lead to synchronous activity in a population of neurons consistent with the
binding problem model.
