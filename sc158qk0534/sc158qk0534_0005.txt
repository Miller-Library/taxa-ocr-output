observe activity without stimulus. We then recorded another time series from the same
site while providing a light train stimulus consisting of one second flashes followed by
four seconds of darkness. The first flash was given at 20 seconds after recording began.
Brain Slice - Slices of the optic tectum was made from zebrafish injected with the FMIÂ¬
43XM dye, using the same procedure as for Fluo3 injection. FMI-43XM is fluorescent
only when incorporated into the lipid membrane, and was used to outline neurons and
their processes. It was determined from calcium imaging of the slices that signals came
from optic tectum dendrites, which were 2-5um structures (Fig. 1C).
Data Analysis - In FluoView, dendrites of interest were circled as regions of interest and
their mean intensities exported to an excel file (Fig. 1D). Intensities for each circle was
normalized to the average intensity of the first five seconds, and fading was accounted for
using either only the first minute of the series, during which no fading occurred, or by
averaging the last ten seconds (Ffinal) and adding (1-(Ffinal)/240*framef to the normalized
intensity. The normalized values were used for analysis. Igor Pro software was used to
generate a smoothed graph of the data by taking a rolling average of three data points.
Results
While performing the described dissection, perfusion, and injection, one main
concern was for the vitality of the fish. We found that the main indicators that a live fish
were red gills, visible capillaries under the dissecting scope, and visible blood flow
through capillaries under the confocal microscope. Not only were we able to keep the fish
