zebrafish injected with calcium dye alive under the confocal microscope for two hours or
more. We were able to resolve calcium flux in cell processes as small as 2-5um in the
integrative region where input axons synapse on dendrites of optic tectal neurons. This
technique can provide information on how low level information from the retina is
integrated and processed in individual neurons in the optic tectum through summation of
inhibition and excitation leading to an action potential.
We selected to use a train of light flashes as our stimulus for several reasons. First
of all, a light flash provided a general stimulus to compare neuronal visual processing
activity to background activity in the dark, as recorded by calcium imaging. Because the
optic tectum is expected to have other integrative functions in addition to visual
processing, neurons in the optic tectum are active even in darkness. This activity is
supported by time series recordings of the optic tectum when the zebrafish was in
completely darkness showing individual flashes and synchronous waves of calcium
activity. In fact, recordings in darkness cannot be distinguished from recordings under
light flashes by simple observation, as both display abundant and non-uniform activity
throughout the field of recording. These results show that information from light stimulus
could not be encoded in the optic tectum in simple on-off fashion as in retinal cells.
Instead, the oscillatory activities suggest that each recording represents integrative
processing in the dendritic regions, where summation of inhibitory and excitatory inputs
determined whether a specific higher order neuron would fire. Furthermore, a large
number of these processes were captured occurring in parallel in each recording.
The calcium imaging technique allowed for more detailed analyses of the data
because it combines the ability to record overall wide field activity, as shown by the time
