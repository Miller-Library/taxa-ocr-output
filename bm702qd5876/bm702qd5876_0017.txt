Figure Legend
For all figures, the error bars represent standard deviations in heart rate
Figure 1. Although the average larval heart rate under Curare is slightly higher (212 beats
per minute) than that under MS 222 (190 beats per minute), there is no clear difference
between them.
Figure 2 A is a collection of raw data collected from the light sensor on the response to
carbachol: The amplitude merely reflects the change in optical density of the sample site
and is thus unimportant. As the dose is increased through a longer duration of the pulse
of injection, the interval between contractions increased. B: The increase of this interval
was then normalized with respect to the actual dose in picoliters. The actual dose was
calculated by injecting different durations of pulses into oil. There is a clear dose
dependent negative response of heart rate to Carbachol.
Figure 3. The heart rate increased in response to norepinephrine by 20 beats per minute.
It increased by approximately 30 beats per minute.
Figure 4. Increased injections of 100 uM Norepinephrine did not dramatically increase the
response of the heart.
