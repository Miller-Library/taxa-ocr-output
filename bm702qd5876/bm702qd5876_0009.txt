Discussion
The difference in the degree to which both nitric oxide donors decreased the heart
rate could be due to the procedure of bathing the larva with NONOate rather than directly
injecting it into the pericardium. Another possible reason for this difference could be the
differences in concentration. NONOate had been expected to release more nitric oxide
than SNAP.
Both carbachol and the nitric oxide donors dramatically slowed the heart rate.
Further experimentation is needed to show the relation, if any, between the activation of
muscarinic cholinergic receptors and the nitric oxide pathway. In a 1996 study by
Feldman et. al., the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rats that were involved in
increases in heart rate were linked to a nitric oxide production pathway by
experimentation that inhibited this cardiac acceleration by the application of nitric oxide
inhibitors L-NAME and Methylene blue (21 1). Now that both nitric oxide and carbachol
show acceleration in zebrafish heart rate, important further experimentation includes
manipulation with nitric oxide inhibitors. Another important test of the stimulatory
action of muscarinic cholinergic receptors by carbachol would be to block such
stimulation with atropine. This manipulation could be combined with nitric oxide donors
to see if artificial activation of the nitric oxide pathway down stream was enough to
overcome the inhibition of the proposed pathway upstream. An important component of
future experiments would be to compare light sensor information from different regions
of the heart because Davies et. al. states that cholinergic innervation only occurs in the
fish atrium not the ventricle (261).
