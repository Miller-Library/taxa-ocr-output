The actual reaction of the heart to the catecholamines was more than the expected
one. Fish heart rates are expected to increase “15-20% compared with the 100%
increase reported in some mammals" (Satchell 162). Although the direct effect of
norepinephrine in humans is an accelerated heart rate, the culmination of effects is often a
slowed heart rate because of the compensatory mechanisms. In the case of larval
zebrafish, these compensatory mechanisms were not detected. The effect may be masked
by part of the experiment's design: increasing doses of norepinephrine were added
(Figure 4). We believed the multiple doses would not have an additive effect because of
the short time period of the drug’s action. However, the increase in dose caused by the
increase in duration may have overcome the body’s compensatory mechanisms. The
extremely rapid heart rate of more than 220 beats per minute may be possible only in
these larval fish. Fetal mammals have a faster heart rate than that of adult mammals of
the same species. The response to catecholamines may be mediated through increases in
calcium flow within the contractile mechanisms of the cardiac cell (Satchell 162). This
idea is supported by the changes in heart rate and rhythm pattern caused by ryanodine.
Ryanodine produced not only a dramatically slower heart rate, but also large
standard deviations in this rate. These arrhythmias may be caused by the dramatically
slowed rate and the need (according to Starling’s Law) for the heart to be sufficiently full
and the cardiac muscle thus sufficiently stretched, before the heart can contract. In fact,
calcium is the molecule responsible for contraction of cardiac cells in relation to
Starling’s law because cardiac muscles are more sensitive to being stretched because the
troponin in cardiac muscle cells is more likely to bind to calcium than is other muscle
troponin (Satchell 38).
