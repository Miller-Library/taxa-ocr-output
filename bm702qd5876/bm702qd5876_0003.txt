vasoconstriction, changes in stroke volume, changes in heart rate are essential actions of
vertebrate cardiovascular systems allowing response to stimuli. These processes can be
witnessed in vivo in zebrafish hearts through stimulation of muscarinic cholinergic
receptors, adrenergic receptors, intracellular calcium pathways, sodium-potassium active
pumps, and nitric oxide pathways. The hypothesis of this project was that it would be
possible to examine the muscarinic cholinergic and adrenergic receptor activity and the
intracellular pathways of the larval zebrafish heart through manipulation with known
pharmacological agents.
Cholinergic receptors are responsible for actions of the parasympathetic system.
They include both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. To activate these receptors an
acetylcholine analog, carbachol, was used. To control for the fact that muscarinic rather
than nicotinic receptors were being activated, Curare was used as an immobilizer to keep
the fish in place and also as an inhibitor of nicotinic receptors.
Adrenergic receptors are part of the sympathetic system. Fish have been shown to
have such receptors and respond to adrenaline and norepinephrine but with less increase in
heart rate than expected by mammals (Satchell 162). Norepinephrine activates both alpha
and Bi adrenergic receptors, while isoproterenol only activates beta receptors (Katzung
127-128).
The pharamacological agent Ryanodine inhibits ryanodine receptors necessary in
the intracellular release of Calcium into the cytosol. It is clinically used to treat the
excessive release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that may result in the fatal
condition of malignant hyperthermia (Taylor 188). Calcium is needed to although cardiac
cells to contract properly.
