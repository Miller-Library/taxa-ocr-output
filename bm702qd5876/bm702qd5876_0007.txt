There were no clear differences between the average heart rate of six larvae
immobilized by Curare and one anesthetized by MS 222 (212 bpm and 189 bpm
respectively as illustrated in figure 1). Figure 2A comprises the raw data obtained from
the light sensor for carbachol. Carbachol demonstrated a dose dependent deceleration of
heart rate.
The heart rate of larval zebrafish increased in response to 100 uM isoproterenol
and 100 uM norepinephrine, with a greater increase in response to isoproterenol (Figure
3). The acceleration in response to norepinephrine reached a plateau at approximately
220 bpm even with further doses of norepinephrine (Figure 4).
Both nitric oxide donors decreased the heart rate. Within 15 minutes of injection
of 200 uM SNAP, the heart rate had decreased by half its original rate (Figure 5). Within
the same time period of 15 minutes, NONOate had less of an effect on heart rate
(decreasing it by 40 beats per minute) than SNAP did (decreasing it by 140 beats per
minute) (Figure 6). Overall, SNAP decreased heart rate much more dramatically then
NONOate (Figure 7).
Within 12 minutes, 100 uM ryanodine decreased the heart rate from 212 beats per
minute to 89 beats per minute (Figure 8). Increasing doses of 1 uM ouabain slowed
the heart rate from 216 beats per minute to 82 beats per minute.
In addition to the change in heart rate, the standard deviation of heart rate is a
measurement of cardiac arrhythmia. Ryanodine, both nitric oxide donors, and oubain
caused profound cardiac arrhythmia. However, ryanodine caused the most dramatic
arrhythmia (Figure 10). The maximum standard deviation of ryanodine was 472. The
