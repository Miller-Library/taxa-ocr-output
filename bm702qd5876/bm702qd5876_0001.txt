Abstract:
Zebrafish, Danio rerio, are a useful model system for vertebrate cardiovascular
research. Their transparent bodies during the larval stage of development allow for in
vivo experimentation. Pharmacological experimentation reveals important similarities
between zebrafish hearts and those of mammals. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor activity
was demonstrated through the dose dependent decrease in heart rate caused by the
acetylcholine analog carbachol. Adrenergic receptor responses were elicited by
norepinephrine and isoproterenol. The inhibition of intracellular calcium release
channels by ryanodine also had a decelerating effect on heart rate, as did the disruption of
sodium-potassium active pumps by ouabain. The stimulation of an undefined nitric
oxide pathway by two nitric oxide donors also slowed heart rate. Clearly, the
pharmacologic responses of the zebrafish heart should be further explored as a model for
vertebrate cardiovascular physiology and as a foundation for research in the genetics and
cardiovascular development of zebrafish.
