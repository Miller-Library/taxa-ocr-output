The control for each experiment was a baseline reading of that particular larvaâ€™s
heart beat and circulation before the administration of the pharmaceutical agent. In
addition to these individual controls, I recorded larval heart beat under anesthesia by
luM MS 222, to control for the effects of d-Tubocurarine. A control was needed for d-
Tubocurarine because it is a vasodilator and it releases histamine (Taylor 187).
