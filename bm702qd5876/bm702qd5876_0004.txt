In addition to inhibition of ryanodine receptors by ryanodine, intracellular sodium
potassium active pumps were inhibited by ouabain. As a cardiac glycoside, it inhibits the
natural exchange of sodium and potassium and causes the cells to lose potassium and
accumulate calcium (Kelly and Smith 814). Thus the cells become depolarized.
The role of nitric oxide in relation to heart rate was explored using to nitric oxide
donors, Spermine NONOate and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). Spermine
NONOate releases higher levels of nitric oxide but its release period is shorter than that of
SNAP (Shih 12). SNAP releases low levels of nitric oxide for a considerable time period.
