Introduction
Danio rerio, commonly known as zebrafish, are fresh water tropical fish that
naturally occur in India. Zebrafish are used for biological research due to their short
generation time, the relative ease of their maintenance, their sufficiently small body size
permitting the storage of large populations. The defining characteristic that sets them
apart from other potential vertebrate model systems is that their bodies in the larval stage
are transparent. Their transparency allows for detailed observations of the cardiovascular
system in vivo without the complications of surgical procedures.
I began studying the zebrafish cardiovascular system with the goal of studying
vascular development, growth and repair. Technical problems with this goal included the
difficulty in obtaining cross-reacting mammalian antibodies to receptors and to endothelial
cell growth factors and the lack of a visible response to certain pharmacological agents
that have been shown to play a role in the vascular actions of other model systems. The
size of zebrafish, while allowing for easy storage, made controlled wounding extremely
difficult. These problems highlighted the need for more knowledge describing the
cardiovascular physiology of the normal zebrafish.
The short generation time and transparent bodies of the zebrafish caused the fields
of genetics and developmental biology to be interested in zebrafish as a model system to
study cardiovascular mutations among others. However, before abnormal zebrafish
hearts can be characterized, better understanding of the normal zebrafish heart is needed.
The zebrafish heart has developed two distinct chambers before the larva hatches (Kimmel
255). Heart beat developes even sooner, within 24 hours of fertilization. Vasodilation,
