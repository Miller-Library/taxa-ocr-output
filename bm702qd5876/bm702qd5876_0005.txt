Materials and Methods
Adult zebrafish were maintained in fresh water at 28° Celsius, under a controlled
light source with a regular light cycle of 9 dark hours in a 24 hour period. In order to
obtain fertilized eggs, marbles were placed in the tank the night before. I then syphoned
the bottom of the tank in the morning and manually separated the fertilized eggs. Next, I
placed the eggs in 10% normal hanks and 90% de-ionized water solution in an incubator
at 28° Celsius.
Larvae between 6 and 8 days post fertilization were used for each experiment. I
immobilized each larva with 2 mg d-Tubocurarine in 1 ml 10% Hanks solution. The
larvae were placed in a temperature controlled stage of the light microscope at 28
Celsius. A robotic arm was used to inject all the pharmacological agents except
NONOate through a glass capillary tube directly into the caudal end of the pericardium.
luM Carbachol, 100 uM Isoproterenol,100 uM norepinephrine, 200 uM SNAP, 1 uM
Quabain, and 100 uM Ryanodine were the concentrations injected. NONOate was
added to the diluted Hank solution surrounding the larva to a final concentration of 100
UM, instead of injection. Vacuum grease helped secure the larva in the same place on the
slide. All injections were made at a pressure of 60 psi.
Each injection and reaction was observed under a magnification of 10 with
Nomarski optics and videotaped. We digitized the heart rate from the visual data of the
video tape by using a light sensor and the computer program Dempster. The interpeak
interval, or period, was measured using this program. The heart beat is the frequency, or
inverse of the period, converted to beats per minute.
