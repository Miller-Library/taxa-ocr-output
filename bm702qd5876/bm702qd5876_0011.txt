Calcium may also contribute to the change in rhythm not only because of this
difference of the affinity of cardiac cell fibers for calcium, but also in some other
mechanism. Calcium plays a role in the regular rhythm of the vasomotion of arteries, and
ryanodine can inhibit that role (Griffith and Edwards H1696). The data collected by
ryanodine is surprising for a teleost because previous studies argued that extracellular
rather than intracellular sources of calcium played more prominent roles (Vornanen
R1432). Bradykinin, verapamil, and diltiazem have been used to show differences in the
roles of extracellular and intracellular calcium sources in canine cells and should be used
in future experimentation to explore the role of calcium in the zebrafish heart (Yang et.
al. 59).
Quabain's mode of action was to disrupt the active exchange of sodium and
potassium. Theoretically as a cardiac glucoside, ouabain should have contributed to an
increase in intracellular calcium and thus had opposite effects of ryanodineâ€™s inhibition of
intracellular release of calcium. A study by Gjini, et. al. show that a cardiac glucosides
reduce the calcium current (95). A reduction in calcium current could have had similar
effects as an inhibition of calcium release, thus explaining the similar responses to
ryanodine and ouabain.
A significant next step in this research will be to apply the tool of the light sensor
to examine perfusion rates and quantify vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Nitric oxide is
a vasodilator (Eckenhoff and Longnecker 356). Histamine which may be stimulated by
Curare is also a vasodilator (although the control showed it did not exhibit clear
contributions) (Babe and Serafin 585). The light sensor technique will be especially
important with pharmacological agents like norepinephrine that act as vasoconstrictors in
