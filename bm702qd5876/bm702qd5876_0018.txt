Figure 5: Within 15 minutes of injection of 200 uM SNAP, heart rate decreased by 50%.
Figure 6. Within 15 minutes of administration of 100 uM NONOate, heart rate decreased
By 40 beats per minute.
Figure 7. Administration of 200 uM SNAP decreased the heart rate more than that of
100(M NONOate.
Figure 8. Following the injection of 100 uM ryanodine, the heart rate decreased from 212
beats per minute to 89 beats per minute.
Figure 9. Increasing injections of ouabain decelerated the heart rate even more.
Figure 10. The decrease in heart rate after injection of 100 uM ryanodine was dramatic
and continual. The huge standard deviations (as illustrated by large error bars) at different
sampling periods show cardiac arrhythmia.
Figure 11. Four beats into this sequence, there is a larger interval between peaks. It
represents a pause between heart beats. The heart recovers to normal and then there is an
even more dramatic pause between contractions of a couple of seconds.
