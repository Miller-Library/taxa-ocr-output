Conclusions
Through manipulation by pharmacological agents, these experiments support the
hypothesis that the larval zebrafish heart has muscarinic cholinergic receptor activity,
adrenergic receptor activity, an intracellular calcium release pathway necessary for
proper contraction, and a nitric oxide pathway necessary for normal rhythm similar to
that of mammals. Therefore zebrafish are an effective vertebrate model system for
cardiovascular research. Further experimentation with the vascular responses to these
pharmacological agents is needed, and the transparency of the larval zebrafish bodies will
allow for a new technique of data collection on cardiovascular physiology by a light
sensor.
