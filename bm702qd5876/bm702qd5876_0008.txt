standard deviation is a slightly misleading measurement of arrhythmia however because
the data are skewed heavily to the side o
slower heart rates; the major arrhythmias were
all long pauses in heart rate rather than irregular accelerations. Figure 11 shows the raw
data from a portion of the ryanodine experiment, including two long pauses in heart rate.
