Introduction
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polycheria osborni : Exact'>Polycheria osborni</span> is an amphipod of the sub-
order <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gammaridea : Exact'>Gammaridea</span> that is known to live in the tunic of
several different species of colonial ascidians. It ranges
in the lower intertidal and subtidal zones from Puget
Sound, Washington to southern California. It was found
in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplidium : Exact'>Aplidium</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Amaroucium : Exact'>(Amaroucium)</span> by Colman (1898), in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Clavelina : Exact'>Clavelina</span>
sp. by Alderman (1936) and in a variety of other asci¬
dians by Abbott and Newberry (1980) and Featherstone
(1980). Its anatomy and some of its behavior were described
by Skogsberg and Vansell (1928). Featherstone (1980) pro-
vided quantitative data on the incidence of Polycheria
osborni and contributed many new observations on its be-
havior. The present study was undertaken to provide ad-
ditional data on the distribution and abundance of the am-
phipod, a quantitative look at the ability of ascidians
to heal a vacated Polycheria osborni burrow, and ob-
servations on the feeding habits of Polycheria osbor-
ni. It also reports the finding of a second species of
commensal gammarid amphipod, this one living in the com¬
mon cloacal cavity of the ascidian <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplidium solidum : Exact'>Aplidium solidum.</span>

Distribution and Abundance of Polycheria osborni
Ascidians were collected at low tide at Mussel
Point, using a putty knife to remove them from the sub-
strate. They were taken to the laboratory in plastic bags
and glass jars and examined under a dissecting micro¬
scope for the presence of Polycheria osborni. The areas
of those colonies that were inhabited by Polycheria os-
borni were measured using a transparent plastic grid
marked in square centimeters. The number of amphipods
living in the whole colony was noted as well as the max-
mum number of amphipods that were found living in a
square centimeter. The species that were examined in a
quantitative fashion were Aplidium solidum, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Distaplia occidentalis : Exact'>Distaplia

us;these are species not studied in detail by Feather-
stone (1980).
Information on amphipods in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplidium arenatum : Exact'>Aplidium arenatum,</span>
Aplidium propimguum and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Synoicum parfustis : Exact'>Synoicum parfustis</span> was provided
by Bill Mulroy, who was making a study on the morpho-
logy and taxonomy of these three species. My verification
Wa
of Featherstone's (1980) data yeré obtained in a quali¬
tative manner by examining some samples of those species
for the presence of Polycheria osborni.
All four of those species that were examined quan¬
titatively contained Polycheria osborni; data are shown
ad
in Figs. 2-5. Aplidium arenatum, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplidium propinquum : Exact'>Aplidium propinquum</span> er-

Synoicum parfustis contained any Polycheria osborni, most
likely due to their having a sand encrusted tunic which
leaves little room for Polycheria osborni to burrow.
Rehm
The average number per cm. among the ascidians
which contained Polycheria osborni ranged from O in many
colonies to 1.81 in one colony of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cystodytes lobatus : Exact'>Cystodytes lobatus.</span> Fi¬
gures for the maximum number of amphipods per cm.
ranged from O in many colonies to 12, the highest figure
once again being found in Cystodytes lobatus. High va-
lues in both average and maximum numbers per cm.e were
often associated with the presence of many juveniles.
Juvenile burrows measure less than a millimeter long,
whereas those of adults can measure up to 8mm. in length
(Featherstone, 1980). The percent of colonies that were
infested with Polycheria osborni ranged from 12.04% in
Distaplia occidentalis up to 74.4% for Cystodytes lo-
batus.
Fig. 1 summarizes the information on the distribution
of Polycheria osborni at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove. As-
cidian species not included in the list are considered
to be improbable hosts for the amphipod due to their
very small size or to the hardness or heavy sand en¬
crustation of their tunics.
The low numbers of amphipods noted in the examina¬
tion of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Distaplia occidentalis : PartialExact'>Distaplia occidentalis may</span> be related to the small
sizes of the colonies examined, and the close proximity
of the zooids to one another within the colony; there is
very little tunic available on which the amphipod can settle.
On the other hand, the colonies of Cystodytes lobatus that
were examined were much larger and presumably older,
and the zooids are less closely packed, allowing
Polycheria osborni more time and space to settle on this
Rehm
ascidian. The colonies of Aplidium solidum that were
available at the time of this study were fairly small,
and the test of this ascidian is not quite as smooth
as that of Cystodytes lobatus. In addition, zooid sys-
tems are very prominent in this ascidian, and pull a¬
way from any physical contact, making it difficult for
Polycheria osborni to settle and burrow. However, a
fairly high percentage of the colonies of this ascidian
(42.9%) were found to be inhabited by the amphipod.
Polycheria osborni was relatively scarce in
Clavelina huntsmani. However, one amphipod was observed
to burrow completely into the tunic within a five minute
period. It is clear that the tunic is a suitable home for
Polycheria osborni yet the amphipod is an infrequent in-
habitant of this ascidian. Although Clavelina huntsmani
is a colonial ascidian, the zooids are not completely em¬
bedded in a common test. Because of this, the surface area
ef the test is distributed in such a way that may make
the amphipods settling on this ascidian relaively dif-
ficult, accounting for its relative scarcity in this asci¬
dian. Fig. 6 pictorially depicts two examples of the ways
in which <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Polycheria osborni : PartialExact'>Polycheria osborni may</span> burrow into the relative-
ly thin test. Small amphipods (up to imm. in length) of-
ten burrow into the distal end of the zooid between the
oral and atrial siphons, while larger specimens (up to 3mm.
in length) have been observed burrowed into the side of
the zooid at an angle, rather than perpendicular to the
vertical axis of the zooid. The distance from the dis-
tal end of the zooid to the furthest point of the bur-
Rehn
row was measured in ten infested zooids of Clavelina
huntsmani. A value of zero was given to those that had
burrowed into the top of the zooid; the burrow measured
furthest from the distal end was at a distance of 9 mm.
Healing of Abandoned Amphipod Burrows
When an amphipod abandons its burrow, the ascidian
is able to heal the depression left behind in the tunic
(Featherstone, 1980). To investigate this healing abi-
lity quantitatively, Polycheria osborni were removed
from their burrows from specimens of Aplidium solidum,
Clavelina huntsmani, and Cystodytes lobatus using a
pair of fine forceps. Burrow length was measured using
Vernier calipers to within +.125 mm. Burrow length
was used as a measure of amphipod length by Featherstone
(1980); in the present study burrow length was used as
a rough measure of burrow volume. After the amphipods
were removed, the locations of the burrows were marked
using tiny stainless steel pins (minuten nadeln) in
such a way that the tunic would be distorted as little
as possible. The ascidians with amphipods removed were
maintained in a trough of running seawater 38mm. deep.
Seawater flowing through the trough ranged in temperature
11.5 - 13.0°C. Burrows were measured at intervals over
a period of 200 hours until they were no longer recog¬
nizable as burrows and so considered to be completely
healed.
Healing times (Fig. 7) are given as a range in
time beginning at the last observation at which the bur-
Rehm
row was still visible and extending to the first observa-
tion at which the burrow had disappeared. Healing times
varied from 0-10 hours in one Aplidium solidum bur¬
row to 160-170 hours in one Cystodytes lobatus burrow.
Aplidium solidum was consistently the fatest healer, fol-
lowed by Clavelina huntsmani and Cystodytes lobatus in
that order.
The differences in healing times can perhaps be at¬
tributed to two factors, the relative stiffness of the
test and the location of the abandoned burrow to the
zooid systems. Cystodytes lobatus is known to have a
rather stiff test, whereas the tunic of Clavelina hunts-
mani is rather yielding. The test of Aplidium solidum
is somewhat soft and fleshy. In addition, the surface of
the tunic in Aplidium solidum is a very irregular one.
Polycheria osborni often takes advantage of existing
flaps of tunic on this ascidian when creating its bur¬
row and the result is often a relatively shallow de¬
pression in the surface of the test.
Feeding Observations
It has been speculated that the diet of Poly-
cheria osborni consists of detritus and small plants
and animals (Skogsberg and Vansell, 1928). No behavior-
al evidence for the selectivity of food types on the
basis of size or nature of the particles of food has
been reported. Toward this end, tunicates bearing the
amphipod were placed in a fingerbowl that was surrounded
by constantly flowing seawater to maintain temperature
Rehm
at 11-13 °C. The colony was arranged in such a way that
the interior of the burrow and the working of the amphi-
pod's mouth parts could be observed through a dissecting
microscope.
The brown algae <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis pyrifera : Exact'>Macrocystis pyrifera</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Laminaria : Exact'>Laminaria</span>
sp.and the red algae <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina : Exact'>Gigartina</span> sp. and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina papillata : Exact'>Gigartina papillata</span>
were ground separately in a blender to yield four dif-
ferent types of detritus. These were then filtered u-
aa
sing Tyler screens to create preparations of particle
sizes. The green algay <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cladophora columbiana : Exact'>Cladophora columbiana</span> was
collected in the field as well and used in the feeding
experiments. Brine shrimp larvae and <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pollicipes : PartialExact'>Pollicipes nauplii</span>
were hatched hatched in the lab, and eggs from the asci¬
dian <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ascidia ceratodes : Exact'>Ascidia ceratodes</span> were taken from that ascidian
using a pipette. Each one of these foods was fed to the
amphipod using a pipette to create a particle-laden cur-
rent of water that passed by the amphipod's burrow at a
reasonably close distance, making it possible for the
amphipod to catch the particles with its antennae. The
foods that Polycheria osborni ingested were noted, and
observations on feeding behavior were made.
Particles of Macrocystis pyrifera and Laminaria sp.
that were up to three times the length of the amphipod's
burrow (up to 5-6 mm.) were taken and eaten. Neither spe-
cies of Gigartina were eaten, although particles of both
were caught and "examined" by Polycheria osborni before
rejection. Cladophora columbiana was rejected similarly.
Both nauplii were caught and ingested. The larger brine
shrimp larvae were trapped in the burrow by the amphi¬
Reh
pod closing the burrow with its pereiopods as it has been
reported to do in other circumstances (Skogsberg and Van-
sell, 1928). Ascidia ceratodes eggs were also ingested.
Feeding was observed to take place as described by
Skogsberg and Vansell (1928) and Featherstone (1980).
In addition, the gnathopods were observed to scrape the
pleopods clean and then pass what was gleaned to the mouth
parts, presumably for ingestion. The gnathopods and the
antennae were observed to be capable of reaching out¬
side the burrow to secure a particle of food that had come
to the amphipod's notice.
The behavior associated with the rejection of
particles of algae was similar in each case. Polycheria
osborni grasped the particle with its gnathopods and
turned it over and over while apparently attempting
to feed on it. After having been turned in this manner
a dozen or so times, the unsuitable particle was vi-
gorously rejected from the burrow using the gnathopods
and sometimes kicking it away with the pleopods. My ob-
servations suggested an amphipod must actually examine
a particle carefully and perhaps try to ingest it before
recognizing it either as desirable food or undesirable
matter. This is made evident by the fact that a single

Polycheria osborni eeulbe observed to first eagerly
accept and then reject the same particle in the same
manner several times in succession. Gigartina species
and <span style='background-color:grey' title='Cladophora columbiana : Fuzzy'>Cladophora coltmbiana</span> are known to be particularly
tough algae, and were possibly relected for that reason.
During these experiments Polycheria osborni ex¬
10
Rehm
hibited no selective behavior with regard to the initial
securing of food particles. The amphipod appears to be
highly opportunistic with respect to feeding, as it ini-
tially reacted enthusiastically to everything fed to it.
Second Species of Gammarid Amphipod
While undertaking the study of the distribution
of Polycheria osborni in the ascidian Aplidium solidum,
a second species of gammarid amphipod was discovered to
be living in She common cloacal cavity of this tunicate.
A small scale distribution study on this amphipod was
done in a manner similar to that done for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polycheria : Exact'>Polycheria</span> os¬
borni, and some observations were made on the natural his-
tory of this unreported amphipod. Of 73 colonies of Apli¬
dium solidum examined, totalling 959 cm.2, 7 colonies
were infested, and a total number of 10 amphipods were
found.
Thus about 11% of the colonies examined were inha¬
bited by the second amphipod. It uses the common cloacal
cavity as a retreat, but was seen walking about on the
surface of the test, presumably searching for food. It
is not highly specialized morphologically as is <span style='background-color:grey' title='Polycheria osborni : Fuzzy'>Boly-
cheria osborni.</span> An identification of the species is stilj
needed, as the specimens taken during these observations
were juveniles too small to identify with surety.

Summary
1. From April-June, 1981, ascidians collected at Paci¬
fic Grove were examined for the presence of the amphipod
Polycheria osborni.
2. Polycher
ta osborni was found in Aplidium solidum and
Cystodytes lobatus, in addition to several species from
which it is already reported. It was absent in Synoicum
parfustis, Aplidium arenatum and Aplidium propinquum.
3. Healing of burrows vacated by Polycheria osborni was
examined in three ascidians. Aplidium solidum was able
to heal vacated <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Polycheria osborni : PartialExact'>Polycheria osborni burrows</span> fastest,
followed by Clavelina huntsmani and Cystodytes lobatus;
respectively.
4. Polycheria osborni apparently catches potential food
particles unselectively; it appears to examine and at¬
tempt to ingest all particles, thereafter eating some
and rejecting others. Polycheria osborni ingested bar-
nacle and brine shrimp nauplii and ascidian eggs as well
as brown algal detritus. Particles of Cladophora columbiana
and Gigartina sp. were not ingested, possibly owing to
their toughness; they were rejected from the burrow by
use of the gnathopods and/or the pleopods.
5. Polycheria osborni can retain active food organisms
such as nauplii within its burrow by closing the bur-
row opening.
6. Polycheria osborni can use its antennae and gnatho¬
pods to secure food particles lying outside the burrow
on the test of its ascidian host.
7. A second species of gammarid amphipod was discovered

living in the common cloacal cavity of Aplidium solidum.
