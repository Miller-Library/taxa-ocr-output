Gelidium spp.in three of the five population distributions
showed a similar gradient.
Hildenbrandia occidentalis shows a reverse gradient
(fig. 12 B) going from a control value below 100 cm, up
to 2250 cm in an area near the butfall, and back doun to
80 cm? in the control area on the opposite of the pipe.
Porphyra lanceolata shows this same gradient, but not
with the same dramatic figures.
The distributional squares show a correlation between
distance from the outfall and total number of species in
the square. (fig. 13) There exists a direct relationship,
i.e., few species close to the outfall and more species
as the distance increases. The exception to this, distriÂ¬
bution type V in figure 12 E could be explained by the
higher intertidal organisms having less direct exposure
to the effluent. Organisms living closer to the lower
low water level are more constantly washed by effluent.
One correlation for further investigation is that
between the chemical concentrations found at various
locations and the algal distribution in those same
areas. If one could begin his tests on the effects of
algal viability of the effluent at the next higher
concentrations than was detected at the area where an
alga first occurred in the distributions, it might be
possible to ascertain exactly what constituent or con-
stituents are limiting its environment and at what
concentrations.
