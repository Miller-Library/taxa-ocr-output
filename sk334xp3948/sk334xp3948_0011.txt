Conclusion
Both the current studies and the chemical studies
verified that the effluent is traveling south, along
the coast. There are measureable amounts of some comÂ¬
ponents of effluent up to 4000 feet to the south of the
outfall. There is a difference in the rates of dilution
between constituents, this unexplained.
The algal distributions show effects up to that same
4000 feet to the south, with some algae appearing only
utside this distance (Gigartina canaliculata). The algae
show varying tolerances to the effluent, appearing at
different distances from the outfall, corresponding to
different concentrations of effluent. Indicator algae
must be verified at different locations, but this will
be a start. Concerning the Carmel outfall, this dis-
tributional study with additional studies will provide
a baseline measure of change through time.
