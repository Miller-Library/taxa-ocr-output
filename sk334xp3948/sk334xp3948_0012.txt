Summary
Both transects and distributional squares may be used
to ascertain algal distribution.
Marine algal distribution around an outfall area shows
2.
distinct variations, dependent on the direction of
effluent flow.
There exists a varying resistance to the effluent in
different species, and within the same species.
The gradients shown by species of algae may lend themÂ¬
selves to use as pollution indicators, but more work
must be done to minimize the variables of this study.
