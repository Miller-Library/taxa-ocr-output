As for the use of any of these types of algae as
indicators, much more research would have to be done,
at different outfalls, under different conditions, and
over longer periods of time. The algal distributions
presented here do exhibit gradients which might imply
their use as indicators. The corallines, Endocladia
muricata, Gelidium spp., Iridaea splendens, Rhodoglossum
affine, Gigartina papillata, Gigartina canaliculata,
Egregia menziesii, Hildenbrandia occidentalis, and
Porphyra lanceolata all show signs of being possible
candidates for indicators of damage, but this study was
of only one outfall. To formulate conclusions, more
work must be done.
