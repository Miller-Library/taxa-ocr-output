The selection of these distributional squares was not
random. Areas of five "characteristic types" (described
below) were chosen at each of eight transect stations
(excluding 3 and 5):
3-4 feet above mean lower low water
horizontal
inshore
direct sun
2-3 feet above mean lower low water
vertical
not facing waves
2-3 feet above mean lower low water
II.
vertical
facing waves
inshore
3-4 feet above mean lower low water
horizontal
standing water, direct sun
near wave action
4-5 feet above mean lower low water
horizontal
rocky, few plants
direct sun, splashed at high tide
Wost algae were identified in the field, but some
were taken into the lab and identified there.
The data from the transects are contained in fig.10A-J
The cross-sectional map appears at the top, the species
found are listed on the left margin, and their approxi
mate area of occurrence indicated with either half or a
full bar, relative to subjective population count.
Figure 11 shows the distribution of algae in these
transects and is a summary. A bar is placed in the appro
priate transect column showing occurrence. The length of
the bar is proportional to the population present in the
