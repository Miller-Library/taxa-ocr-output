Chemical Analyses
Chemical analyses of the effluent at selected
stations around the outfall area (fig. 4) were then
made for later comparison to the algal distributional
studies. Tests were made for eight parameters. Micro
gram-atom concentrations per liter were calculated for
phosphates, nitrites, and nitrates by standard methods
(Strickland and Parsons) as well as milliliters of
dissolved oxygen per liter using Winkler titration
(Strickland and Parsons). Salinity was measured with
a refractometer, and hydrogen sulfide and chlorine
were determined by iodine generation and thiosulfate
titration with a starch endpoint. Temperature was meas
ured with a standard centigrade thermometer.
The results ofthe chemical tests are summarized in
figures 5-8. The first station "A" is at the sewage plant
itself, and, after that, the stations correspond to the
geography, going from Mission Point at the north, through
the outfall area, and down to Point Lobos to the south.
The concentrations obtained through the tests verified
the direction of currents as studied. The values of
nitrites, phosphates, hydrogen sulfide, and chlorine
were all at their highest values at the plant, and show
gradual dilutions going south, with apparently no effluent
going to the north.
