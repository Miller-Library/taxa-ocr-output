of the outfall pipe. A map (fig. 1) of a larger area was
obtained from the California State Department of Parks and
Recreation which showed the area from Mission Point (approx.
2000 feet north of the outfall) to Point Lobos (approx, one
mile south of the outfall).
Following this mapping, an extensive current study was
done of Carmel Bay south of the Carmel River. Both fluorÂ¬
escein dye packets and 12 plastic bottles filled with fresh
water were used for each run. The dye packets were helpful
around the immediate area and the bottles were more useful
for the offshore currents. The dye packets were thrown into
the water and followed up to 1/2 hour, while the bottles
were dropped in a pre-determined pattern and sighted from
several reference points at 15 to 30 minute intervals. The
bottles were recovered after two to three days, if possible.
Figures 3A-E give the results of the current studies.
Around the outfall, there is a general flow towards the
beach, which then turns north, circles back toward the
ocean, and then heads directly south. The offshore currents
go directly south and gyre offshore from Monastery Beach.
ur current studies showed that the effluent missed the
rocks just south of the pipe, going far enough offshore,
but being carried back into shore by the gyre. This was
verified by the results of our chemical tests, this
station giving consistently lower concentrations of the
effluent constituents than stations further south, The
recovery percentages were 33% for the first current study
and 58% for the second.
