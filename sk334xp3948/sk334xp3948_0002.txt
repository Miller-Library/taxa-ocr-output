Comparitively little has been done concerning the
distribution of marine algae, especially around an outfall
Doty (1949) summarized the tidal effects on algal vertical
distribution and did some work in the Carmel area, before
the present outfall was built. His work, however, includes
only conspicuous genera and covered such a wide range of
coastline that this could not be used as a control. Ricketts
and Calvin (1939) give transects in much more detail, but do
not cover polluted areas that surround an outfall.
The Carmel outfall, Carmel, California was chosen as
the sample study area. It is situated on a rocky point
just south of the Carmel River mouth and about one mile
north of Point Lobos State Park. There are rocky inter-
tidal areas (see fig. 1) within 1000 yards to the north
and most of the way to Point Lobos to the south. There
was an ideal gradient of natural population densities
of marine algae.
Mapping and Current Studies
In thepreliminary tests, I was one of a group of five
students at Hopkins Marine Station studying the Carmel
putfall area. The initial research, that of mapping the
area around the outfall and studies of ocean currents in
the Carmel Bay, was a necessary prerequisite to all of
our individual projects. Using a measured line and compass
the immediate outfall area was mapped (fig.2) showing in
detail, rocks, tidepools, etc., 150 feet to either side
