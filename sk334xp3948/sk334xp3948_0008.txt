culated from the results of the chemical tests) to
others which may withstand that same concentration of
effluent.
Tables 12 A-E show the results of the distribu
tional squares. Each species is followed through one
of the five types of locations, plotting the area
covered versus the distance from the outfall. The para
meter of area covered is assumed to be equivalent to the
suitability of the environment to growth of the alga.
These should quantify what was hypothesized by figure 11
and should give evidence supporting the use of certain
types of algae as indicators. These tables contain only
algae whose gradients seem significant. The entire list
of species appears in the appendix.
Concerning the individual species, Gigartina canal
iculata, appears to be the most sensitive to any concenÂ¬
tration of effluent, since it occurs only on the seaward
side of Point Lobos. Leathesia difformis and Postelsia
palmaeformis exhibits slightly higher tolerance, their
first appearance still 4000 feet south of the outfall.
Both Gigartina canaliculata and Leathesia difformis are
common throughout the Monterey area. Both the articulated
and crustose corallines show a tremendous gradient (fig.12 B).
Mission Point, one of the control areas, shows crustose
coralline covering an area of over 2000 cm. This value
drops to zero behind the outfall and again rises to over
1600 cm2 at South Point Lobos, the seaward transect.
