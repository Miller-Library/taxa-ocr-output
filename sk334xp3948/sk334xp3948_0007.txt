transect. The species are arranged with the species
occurring furthest away from the outfall listed first
and those occurring mainly at the outfall listed last
The empty bars indicate noticeable physical damage to
the algae, e.g., little side-branching, dryness, or
stunted growth.
The transects provide useful information concerning
the presence and qualitative abundance of marine algae
at various transect locations. These have an advantage
over the distributional squares because they cover a much
larger area and provide a more general idea of algal
distribution around an outfall area relative to tidal
height and wave exposure. Their primary value is contained
in their summary
The "V-shape" of the summary table in figure 11 in
dicates varying tolerance of marine algae to the effluent.
Codium fragile, Gastroclonium coulteri, and Postelsia
palmaeformis all appear in transects at a great distance
from the outfall. Hildenbrandia occidentalis, on the
other hand, appears in every transect, being extremely
dense at the outfall area. The algae listed between
these exhibit a gradient of resistance between algae
like Codium and Hildenbrandia, suggesting the hypothesis
that marine algae do have varying resistances to effluent
constituents, ranging from the type of alga affected at
ven small concentrations of effluent (which may be cal
