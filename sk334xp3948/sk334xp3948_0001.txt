ISTRIBUTION OF MARINE ALGAE
THE VICINITY OE A SEWAGE OUTFALL
AT CARMEL, CALIFORNIA
Introduction
For years, the standard method for an assay of
pollution has been a test for the presence of coliform
bacteria, under the assumption that these indicate the
presence of other, more harmful bacteria. While this
test may be useful from a public health viewpoint, it
fails to indicate the presence of sewage itself, which
these studies show, may contain more materials harmful
to the environment than coliform bacteria themselves.
An ideal test or "indicator" of pollution should meet
two criteria:be obtainable at all types of outfall areas
and be repeatable. The coliform test conforms to the
first, but is variable on repetition. This paper will
suggest a new type of indicator, that of varying algal
distribution around an intertidal outfall area, as a
helpful measure of the extent of total pollution. It
must be emphasized that this is a correlational study,
and that to be entirely accurate, further field and
laboratory tests would have to be run on the algae in
question to verify that it is the effluent that is re
sponsible for the distributional differences.
