There were differences in the rates of dilution
of the constituents, phosphate and salinity diluting
the fastest, while nitrite and chlorine residues were
detectable in measurable quantities at North Point
Lobos. The nitrite given off by the outfall is oxidized
to nitrate, and these describe reciprocal curves on the
graphs. As previously stated, the low values at station
E, just south of the outfall, are explained by the cur-
rent pattern, showing the effluent missing the station.
Algal Distribution
Marine algal distribution was studied both quali
tatively and quantitatively. The qualitative aspect
was studied through the use of transects, imaginary
Lines running from the highest growth of marine algae to
mean lower low water. All algae within 1/2 ft. on either
side of these lines were noted on a cross-sectional map
of the rocky intertidal area being studied. If an alga
looked unhealthy, this too was noted. Transects (fig.9)
were taken both north and south of the outfall area,
ranging from Mission Point to Point Lobos.
The quantitative distributions were obtained using
wooden squares 1/2 meter on a side, the area studied
each time being 1/4 meter2. All marine algae within
the square were noted and again, if there was a definite
structural injury to the plant, this was also noted.
