METHODS

Tegula funebralis were tested for reactions to light in sev¬
—.—.—
eral manners: (1) Three aquaria, as much alike in con¬
tents as possible (rocks, shell fragments, algæe, number of
snails) were set up under different light conditions and
the snail movements noted. (2) Groups of snails were
subjected to different intensities and spectral regions of
visible light, and their reactions observed and timed. (3)
Individuals were allowed to move in directional light.

response of such operated snails compared with the nor-

mal. Such operations were not generally harmful: all
operated animals survived for at least two weeks and no
infections were obvious. (Before operation, the snails
were anesthetized by slow addition of an equal volume of
isotonic MgCl- solution to sea water in which a number
of snails were lying upside down. A temperature of 30° C
also served to keep the snails extended out of their shells.)

sities of light, and observing their rate of exit from the
lighted area. As soon as the snails were placed in a circle
of light, they began turning and pushing each other
around in their attempt to move out of the light. They
move to the darkest areas available, and rest only when
they reach a crack or maximum darkness. The same
number of snails left in the same area, but without light,
disperse much more slowly. (Fig. 3). Snails previously
adapted to different light intensities were also tested in
this manner (Fig. 4). Those previously exposed to full
sunlight (6000 F.C.) scarcely responded at all
(3) Both operated and normal snails give a "shadow re-
action," which is best observed if the snail is lying on its
back, with foot partly extended. (If it is not extended far
enough, it will withdraw into the shell when shadowed.
If it is extended too far, the snail turns over and will not
react at all. When the snail is attached to a surface by its
foot, shading causes it to pull back its head, and to remain
in that position for some time,— e. g. up to 5 minutes).
