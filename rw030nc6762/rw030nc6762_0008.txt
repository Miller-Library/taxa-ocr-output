activity then increases sharply in tide pools. Maybe for L. planaxis
the splash amount of wetness gives maximum activity; this would protect
from desiccation and allow a larger percentage of activity among the
total population. Whereas L. scutulata, adapted to a lower level,
requires more moisture to attain maximum activity. The difference in
activity of L. planaxis in surf and in tide pools might be accounted
for if the wave force, present in surf action, causes a decrease in
activity. Haseman in 1911 observed that L. littorea became quiescent
during violent splashing by waves. The maximum of three quarters of
the animals having moved since the last observation agrees with the
subjective impression gained during preliminary observations.
On pairing (Fig. 4-5) Correlation of pairing with moisture is
not so evident. In almost all cases of pairing observed under dry
conditions, the animals were observed to cling together, both with
closed operculum, the male attached by dried mucus to the female.
Probably "unpairing" occurs as moisture increases and then some
factor in a good inundation causes a reinterest in the subject.
Moisture has a direct effect, but some other factor or factors
unobserved in this study also may have direct and primary effects.
Fig. 4 indicates the presence of 8% pairing in tide pools, but this
was not on a constant basis. Pairing occurred in the tide pools only
when it was occurringhmong the population as a whole. The pairing
percentages from the individual animals and the population as a whole
correspond quite well.
On clustering - (Fig. 6-7) An increase in moisture produced a
decrease in clustering. Clustering is associated with inactivity. In
most cases the opercula of clustered animals are closed. From the
inverse relationship evidenced here it can be hypothesized that this
