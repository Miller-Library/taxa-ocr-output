stayed closed in the middle of a pool for several hours and then
opened, thereby accounting for the low figure shown by the L. scutulata
The true percentage is probably in the very high nineties.
On number of animals in motion at the time of observation -
(Fig. 2) An increase in moisture produced an increase in the percentage
of animals in motion at the time of observation. Moisture appears to
have a direct effect on this phase of activity. The lack of movement
on dry surfaces shown by both species was also observed in L. littorea
by Haseman in 1911. Again the L. scutuata showed less activity in all
caught
cases; in fact they were notAmoving until surf conditions prevailed.
For neither species was more than 25% of the population in motion at
any time; this was in agreement with subjective impressions formed
during the early generalized observations.
On number of animals which had moved since the last observation,
1-1.5 hours before - (Fig. 3) An increase in moisture produced an
increase in the percentage of animals which had moved since the last
observation. Moisture appears to have a direct effect on this phase of
activity. In two cases L. scutulata showed a higher percentage of
activity. Movement virtually ceases under dry conditions, but one of
the marked L. scutulata moved. Probably one L. planaxis in the
population moved also, but it did so unobserved, thus allowing L.
scutulata to show a higher percentage of activity. P. W. Glynn in
1963 observed that L. scutulata in the endocladia belt showed a
migration with the tide; these results showed a concurring trend at
a higher level. L. planaxis does not appear to indulge in tidal
migrations. This could explain the higher percentage of activity
shown by the L. scutulata under surf conditions. The percent activity
for splash and surf conditions is basically the same for L. planaxis;
