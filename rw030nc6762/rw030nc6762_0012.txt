higher level on the rocky shores.
On pairing - (Fig. 10) An increase in wind produced a decrease
in pairing. This indirect factor seems to correlate better with
pairing than the direct factor of moisture.
Temperature effects
A graph (Fig. 11) relating temperature with attachment to the substrate
by the foot was made. After consideration it is believed that graphing
foot attachment against air temperature is rather meaningless. The
animals in the tide pools are reacting to the temperature of the
surrounding water; each individual on a rock is concerned only with
the temperature of that rock.
Cyclic activity
The moisture-oriented activity pattern shown by the results of this
study would seem to exclude any tidal or circadian rhythm since the
wet-dry cycle doesn't necessarily follow the tides or day and night.
No graphs were made but the correlated field notes were closely
scrutinized and no evidence of rhythms was found for any of the
specific parts of the activity pattern considered in this study.
Haseman (1911) at Woods Hole worked with three species of
east Coast Littorina under the influence of the idea, advanced by
Bohn in 1905, that these animals follow a tidal rhythm. Having found
rhythms correlated with tide level on vertical surfaces only, he
concluded "the primary directed force for rhythmical movements is
the surface film of water" and "Littorina littorea shows no established
rhythm in the absence of tidal changes. Both statements indicate
the lack of a tidal rhythm. It would seem rather that his work proves
that the primary environmental factor effecting the activity of the
East Coast Littorina is moisture.
