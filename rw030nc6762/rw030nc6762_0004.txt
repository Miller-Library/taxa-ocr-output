The data from each group of six were then correlated and graphed,
and the resulting six pages were then clipped to a master graph which
contained the general data. An example of the "book" so formed from
one day's observations is included as Appendix I. These were used as
the basis of graphs attempting to relate individual environmental
factors with specific parts of the activity pattern.
Discussion and Interpretation of Results - The rekability
of the results of this study are limited by three factors: first, the
constant fluctuation of the environment, during a period of observation
the temperature might increase three degrees or a cloud cover the sun;
second, the subjective estimations used to judge the degree of the
parameters; and third, the small number of individuals that can be
kept track of at one time. Therefore the value of the results lies
not in the actual figures obtained, but in the clear emergence of
overall trends.
Moisture effects
On attachment to the substrate by the foot - (Fig. 1) An increase
in moisture produced an increase in percent of animals with foot
attachment. Moisture appears to have a direct effect on this phase
of activity. The 100% activity shown by both species under surf
conditions has definite survival value, it prevents dislodging. Under
all conditions, surf excepted, the L. scutulata showed less activity
than the L. planaxis. The tide pool situation is interesting because
wetness is constant, but the need to hang on is no longer present,
except at high tide. Most of the animals were active, but the 100%
figure shown by L. planaxis is probably not valid. One L. scutulata
