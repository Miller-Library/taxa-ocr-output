is a phenomenon directly related to resisting the effects of desiccation,
an adaptation to the niche in which the animals live. Credence is leant
to this hypothesis by the fact that for the first time L. scutulata
showed a higher percentage of indulgence, the difference between the
two species being greatest under dry conditions. It seems logical that
the less adapted L. scutulata would have more need of protection than
the L. planaxis. A third supporting fact is the agreement of both the
individual and population data on the complete absence of the
phenomenon under splash and surf conditions. Periodically the animals
in the tide pools would leave and form clusters in particular places
around the edges; often the clusters would begin under water.
Unsuccessful attempts were made to relate this to data contained in
this study.
Wind effects
These were considered to act indirectly by an increase of wind causing
a decrease in moisture. The desiccating effect of the wind was proven
by the chapping experienced by this observer after days spent in the
field. During the course of these observations the amount of wind
only changed from little to some.
On clustering - (Fig. 8) An increase in wind produced an increase
in clustering, thus adding to the evidence for the protection from
desiccation hypothesis. Again L. scutulata showed a higher percentage
of clustering with the biggest difference between the two species
occurring during the conditions of greatest stress.
On attachment to the substrate by the foot - (Fig. 9) An increase
in wind produced a decrease in the percentage of animals attached by
the foot. The decrease is greatest in L. planaxis which correlates with
the fact that they tend to cluster less and also that they inhabit a
