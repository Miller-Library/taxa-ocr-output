Summary - Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata are
sea creatures adapted to the ecological habitat "uppermost rocky beach.
Their prime problem is prevention of desiccation. Therefore their
activity is correlated with moisture such that under dry conditions
they will be protected by the closed operculum. Factors equaling or
associated with activity (foot attachment, motion, pairing) all
showed an increase with an increase in moisture. Pairing didn't show a
linear correlation, some unknowns are involved. Clustering, an inactive
state,showed an inverse relationship with moisture; from this data it
is hypothesized to function as a protection against desiccation.
Temperature as measured was decided to be a meaningless parameter.
No evidence was found for either tidal or circadian rhythms. Wind
was considered to act indirectly by decreasing moisture. Thus an
inverse effect with foot attachment and pairing and a direct effect
with clustering were observed. An interesting and consistent difference
was shown by the two species. L. scutulata tended to be less active,
to require more moisture before showing activity, and to demonstrate
a higher percentage of clustering.
