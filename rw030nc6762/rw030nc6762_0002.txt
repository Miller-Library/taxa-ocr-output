Introduction - This study is an attempt to relate
environmental factors to the activity pattern of the two species of
California Littorina, L. planaxis and L. scutulata. The work was
undertaken at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove during May
1964. All observations were made in the field with the populations
disturbed as little as possible.
From preliminary generalized field observations, the
obvious activities of the animals were determined. Activity was
divided into two phases, actual motion and attachment to the substrate
by the foot. Closure of the operculum and attachment by means of
mucus were equated with inactivity. Feeding, an essential part of any
activity pattern, can be assumed to be associated with motion,
otherwise there would be a rescraping of an area. But differentiation
of feeding motion from other motion was impossible in the field;
therefore this parameter was ignored. Two intraspecific phenomena
were often observed, clustering and pairing, with only L. planaxis
indulging in the latter. The obvious environmental parameters were
degree of substrate moisture, amount of wind, degree of illumination,
and temperature. Tide from the table and time of day were also recorded.
Procedure - From among the granite rocks on which the
Littorina live, three representative areas were selected for
intensive observation: first, a tide pool, surrounded by many crevices
(some water filled) and horizontal and vertical areas, reached only by
the high high tides; second, two small tide pools, on a large
creviced generally horizontal rock group, splashed by the low-high
tides; and third, a surf swept large rock, consisting of a vertical
and horizontal plane, inundated by continual surf for 1.5 hours and
