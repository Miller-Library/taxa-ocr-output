would have been 100 micrograms.
Figure 3 shows the hydrolysis of laminarin by various
extracts. The theoretical limit of reducing sugar as glucose
would have been 200 micrograms. When the sample was allowed
to incubate for two hours, a peak of 160 micrograms was
reached at one hour.
Figure 4 shows the hydrolysis of chitin by various extracts.
The theoretical limit of reducing sugar as glucoseamine
would have been 200 micrograms. When a whole gut extract
was permitted to incubate for five hours there was a linear
increase in reducing sugar to a final value of 71 micrograms.
No hydrolysis of the following substrates was observed:
fucoidin, lactose, melibiose, sucrose, raffinose pentahydrate,
stachyose tetrahydrate, inulin, amygdalin, salicin, agar.
gentiobiose, dextran, pectin, arbutin, alginic acid, gum
rabic, quercitrin, kappa carrageanin, melezitose dihydrate.
turanose, cellobiose, a,a-trehalose, rutin, and the Endocladia
polyribose.
Table I shows enzymatic activity expressed in terms
of micrograms of reducing sugar released per millegram of
protein for various regions of the digestive tract. The
glandulae pancreaticae showed the highest amylase activity
and relatively high maltase and laminarinase activity.
However, activity for these substrates was not limited to
this gland. The foregut has substantial maltase and laminarin-
ase activity which may be due to the presence in this gut
