Materials and Methods
All animals used in this study were collected at Old
Fisherman's Wharf, Montery, California. Only animals fresh
from the field were used in these studies because animals
maintained in running sea water in the laboratory were found
to have considerably reduced enzyme activity.
In this study the alimentary canal was divided into five
anatomical parts: the foregut, the fatty tissue very similar
to the coeca hepatica as described by S. R. Tornava (1948),
the glands on the coeca hepatica which are quite similar
to the glandulae pancreaticae as described by S. R. Tornava
(1948), (see figure 5) the first half of the midgut, and
the last half of the midgut plus the hindgut.
The entire digestive tract or gut segments were evcised
from the barnacles and homogenized immediately in chilled
0.2 M acetate buffer (Gomori, 1955) at pH 5.5. The use of
tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffer (Gomori, 1955) at
pH 7.5 yeilded extracts with reduced activity. Generally a
ten per cent homogenate was prepared using a glass homogen¬
izer equipped with a Teflon pestle. The extract was centri¬
fuged in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4000 rpm. Enzymatic
activity was determined on a one ml. aliquot of the resulting
preparation without further purification.
The following substrates were tested: fucoidin (Pierce
Chem. Co.), maltose hydrate (Calbiochem), lactose (Calbiochem).
melibiose (Calbiochem), sucrose (Calbiochem), raffinose
pentahydrate (Calbiochem), stachyose tetrahydrate (Sigma
