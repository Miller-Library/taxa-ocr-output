segment of the glandulae salivales described by S. R. Tornava
(1948). Highest laminarinase activity was found in the
second half of the midgut. High enzyme activity was also
observed in the first half of the midgut where most of the
chitinase activity was demonstrated.
The sum of the activities of the individual segments
of gut exceeded the activity of the whole gut extract. This
discrepancy would suggest the presence of enzyme inhibitors
in some of the tissues or degradation of the carbohydrases
due to proteolytic enzymes.
Since the glandulae pancreaticae are located on the
coeca hepatica and do not border on the gut itself, it was
desireable to determine if there is a duct leading from
these glands to the lumen of the gut. Figure 5 shows several
duct openings in the anterior part of the midgut. While it
was not possible to follow the ducts through the mass of the
coeca hepatica, injection of methylene blue into the glandulae
pancreaticae revealed the presence of ducts terminating at
the duct openings described above.
It should be noted that when the coeca hepatica was
dissected, it was impossible to separate it from part of the
midgut. It is therefore possible that there was no enzymatic
activity here at all.
