Abstract
1. Four digestive carbohydrases, laminarinase, maltase,
chitinase, and amylase have been demonstrated in Balanus
nubilis (Darwin, 1854).
2. The tissues showing highest enzyme activity were
as follows: laminarinase, last half of the midgut: maltase,
foregut: amylase, glandulae pancreaticae: and chitinase,
foremost part of the midgut.
Introduction
Preliminary investigation of the gut of Balanus nubilis
(Darwin, 1854) revealed a, myriad of kinds of particulate
matter including diatoms, other algae, nauplii, and molted
exoskeletons. Such a diverse particulate diet would require
a variety of carbohydrases for efficient digestion. The
literature contains a comprehensive anatomical analysis of
the digestive tract of Balanus improvisus (Darwin, 1854) by
S. R. Tornava (1948), but there are no references to digestive
arbohydrase activity in(
rripedae.
The first part of this study consisted of a survey of
the entire digestive tract for the presence of enzymes capable
of hydrolysing a variety of glycosidic linkages. The second
part of the study examined anatomical regions of the gut
for their enzyme content.
