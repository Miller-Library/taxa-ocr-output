reproducible to 21.5 micrograms in the range from 25-200
micrograms. Dilution of the reaction mixture due to deÂ¬
proteinization brought the theoretical amount of reducing
sugar that could be released by enzymatic action within the
range.
The potenoy of the extracts was evaluated in terms
of their protein content as measured by the method of Lowry
(1951).
Results
Extracts prepared by homogenizing the entire digestive
tract were tested for their ability to hydrolyse a variety
of substrates. Figure 1 shows the time course of release
of reducing sugar from glycogen, starch, and amylose. The
amount of substrate added would have yeilded approximately
200 micrograms of reducing sugar as glucose or half this
amount with respect to maltose. This theoretical limit was
not reached suggesting a progressive degration of the enzyme
in these crude homogenates, perhaps by proteolyses. The
lower activity observed with amylose is probably a reflection
of the low solubility of this substance.
Following the detection of amylase activity the gut
was subdivided as described above and extracts of the various
regions were tested as well as extracts of the whole digestive
tract.
Figure 2 shows the hydrolysis of maltose by various
extracts. The theoretical limit of reducing sugar as glucose
