Figure 1. Time course for release of reducing sugar
from  starch, □ glycogen, and A amylose by extract of
whole digestive tract. Substrates were added as one ml. of
0.3 per cent solution or suspension. All reducing sugar
values are corrected by subtraction of substrate and enzyme
blanks.
Figure 2. Time course for release of reducing sugar
from maltose by extracts of E whole gut, □ foregut,
O glandulae pancreaticae, A coeca hepatica, O first half
of midgut, and A last half of midgut plus hindgut. Substrate
was added as one ml. of 0.3 per cent solution. All reducing
sugar values are corrected by subtraction of substrate and
enzyme blanks.
Figure 3. Time course for release of reducing sugar
from laminarin by extracts of E whole gut, □ foregut,
Oglandulae pancreaticae, A coeca hepatica, O first half
of midgut, and A last half of midgut plus hindgut. Substrate
was added as one ml. of 0.3 per cent solution. All reducing
sugar values are corrected by subtraction of substrate and
enzyme blanks.
Figure 4. Time course for release of reducing sugar
from chitin by extraots of A whole gut, O coeca hepatica,
and □ first half of midgut. Substrate was added as an
approximately 0.3 per cent suspension. All reducing sugar
values are corrected by subtraction of substrate and enzyme
blanks.
