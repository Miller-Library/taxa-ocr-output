A sample of purified kappa carrageanin was provided by
Dr. John H. Phillips of Hopkins Marine Station.
Chitin (Eastman Chem. Co. Technical Grade) was purified
by dissolving it in fifty per cent sulfuric acid and preÂ¬
cipitating it in distilled water.
A polyribose was extracted form Endocladia by dissolving
the alga in cold water with a Waring Blender, precipitation
vith ethanol, deproteinization with chloroform and amyl
alcohol, and drying with acetone.
All substrates were used as 0.3 per cent solutions
except amylose and chitin which were added as a suspension.
The test mixture was composed of one ml. of substrate, one
ml. of homogenate, and three mls. of buffer. The results
of all enzyme assays were corrected by subtracting the reducing
sugar values for enzyme and substrate blanks.
Reducing sugar was determined by the method of Somogvi
as modified by Nelson (1944). This method was found to be
