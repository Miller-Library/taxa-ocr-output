INTRODUCTION
It is assumed that all Littorina planaxis eventually die;
and that there is a steady turnover of individuals in the pop-
ulation. The most obvious possible causes of accidental death
a
e being torn from the rocks and tumbled into thesea, and
being eaten by possible predators as gulls, plovers, crabs,
starfish and squirrels, though these animals were never seen
ransacking the L. planaxis colonies. Since the actual causes of
death in the L. planaxis are not obvious, it was necessary to
devise field studies and laboratory experiments which would
bring out as many of these subtle fatal conditions as possible
The following paper deals first with the structure of thepop-
as a whole; the second and third sections deal with the two
large causes of attrition: wave shock and predation.
