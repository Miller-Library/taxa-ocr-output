On the lst of May there was a very rough sea during the HHV
8.
at night. Alan Miyamoto and others reported significant losses
to populations under study, and I noticed that many of my snails
were gone although I had no census figures on them. On therock
I was using for my aerial predator experiment, an estimated
fifty percent of my animals disppeared during that night.
9. In some of the foregoing experiments it was noted that the
larger snajls tended to remain under water for longer periods
than the smaller snails.
In summary, wave shock has been found capable of removing
sizable numbers of snails from the population. Whether they
survive removal depends largely upon the nature of the substrate
upon which they land. Sand in apparently the kiss of death.
Falling down from high rocks to a rocky substrate is not quite
so fatal unless the snails happen to land in pools where various
predators present a hazard.
