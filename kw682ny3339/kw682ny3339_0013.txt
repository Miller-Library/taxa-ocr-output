CAUSES OF DEATH
Wave Shock
Wave shock would seem to bethe greatest enemy on the pop-
ulation since displacement from the rocks would expose the
snail to a host of predators and adverse conditions not encountered
in thehigh intertidal. In order to determine the effect of
wave shock upon a population of L. planaxis the following field
studies and experiments were undertaken:
1. To determine relative clinging ability, Russel Peterson and
I took five classes of L. planaxis and subjected them to a
stream of water (delivery-12.8 liters/min thru 8.5 mm. diameter)
from thespigots in Agassiz Laboratory. The snails were submerged
to the height of their spires. The results were as follows:
Snail Size 4-6.9/32"

We were looking for a correlation between this experiment
andthe observation that middle sized snails are themost successful
snails in regions of heavy surf. This experiment did not con-
firm this although it must be noted that we were testing more
their ability to maintain position in a current than their ability
to withstand wave-shock.
2. Seven marked L. planaxis of about 6/32" were placed on a
vertical rock face exposed to heavy waves. Seven control snails
(about 12/32") living in thearea were also marked. After two
days and two high tides, only three of the small snails were
found after an exhaustive search. All seven controls were
recovered. This might indicate tuut small smails are dislodged
more readily than larg
