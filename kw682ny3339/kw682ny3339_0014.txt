3. Because I did not see what happened in the above experiment
I repeated the test at a later date. I placed 30 snails ranging
in size from 6-18/32" on the same rock face and watched them
during the period of one high tide. None was dislodged, but the
waves were not so violent as previously.
4. To determine a snails ability to return to the rocks after
being dislodged over a sandy bottom, 100 marked snails were put
into the sea five yards from some rocks in region  The
next day and the days following not one snail was recovered.
The correlary experiment of dropping snails over a rocky Bottom(Fg?:2
was tried under similar conditions. The animals were dropped
ten feet down the side of a cliff into water about two feet deep
at mid-tide. The average size of the recovered snails was 10/32"
Rec overu was 30%
5. To determine the snails ability to return to rocks after
being kicked off (people and other clumsy animals are frequent
enough visitors to the high intertidal to present a hazard to
L. planaxis) 20 marked snails dislodged and allowed to tumble
onto the sand about 3' below ther original positiontawarn.
The following day 12 were recovered dispersed over a
wide area (about five square yards).

persal but with overcast and little wind. Animals were kept under
constant observation. The animals at first opened their opercula
and extended their feet in typical righting movements. Those
who were successful in righting themselves remained extended for
about five minutes but did not try to crawl over the dry sand.
The unseccessful tried for about five minutes and then closed
their opercula. The righted snails closed also. As soon as
