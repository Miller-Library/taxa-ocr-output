foot therefore designated a two square foot grid.
After the grids had been established, all the snails within
each grid-quadrant were collected and then taken back to the
laboratory for measuring.
The results of these population surveys are summarized in
the two graphs following. Additional graphs are found in the
appendix.
From casual observation it would seem that the smallest
individuals in the L. planaxis population live the furthest
down on the rocks, because the veliger larvae probably begin
their attached existance at or below the "waterline". Its
asumed further that the snails move gradually up the rocks as
they grow. From the snails I sampled and observed, the relation
ship of size to vertical distribution seems to be influenced
by more than age. For instance, there seems to be a correlation
between theamount of spray andthe dominant size in a population.

The g2.24 and Fg26 have very little splash and small
snails; 2:3,4 where spray is grest and wave force is also high,
is composedpredominantly of middle sized snails (appendix);
the  where spray is high but wave force is low has the
largest snails (appendix). Apparently then conditions for optimum
growth are a large amount of spray and minimum amount of direct
wave shock.
Another factor affecting the vertical distribution of smaller
snails is the location of crevices in the sampled area. Smaller
snails are found in these crevices at heights where they would
not be expected. Graph I, 384 show that the size/frequency
distribution can be different for a crevice and a vertical face
adjacent to one another. In this particular example the incid-
ence of small snails is greater in thecrevice. From other
