they were wetted they became active, crawling as rapidly as
they could away from the open sea towards a shore rock. With
the exception of one individual who later changed his direction
all snails crawled away from the sea. This experiment was per-
formed on the rising tide. Snails crawling on a sandy substrate
cannot hold their position when hit by wave surge but tumble
with the current. All those I was watching in this experiment
were lost to me after the third such wave surge inundated them.
7. The failure of the snails to regain the rocks in the above
experiment suggests that the incoming tide presents too much of
a handicap to crawling over the sand due to the increased wave
surge over time. The countersituation--snails attempting to
regain rocks on a falling tide--was tried. Twenty-eight snails
ranging from 6-18/32" were released on a strip of sand where the
nearest boulder was 15" away from the populktion. The sand was
damp and as in the previous experiment all individuals immediately
popped out, and those not righted immediately began righting
movements. Once righted all began crawling in a straight line.
Two-thirds of the animals crawled towards the sea and nearest
rock, the rest moved further up the shore. Although two snails
came within two inches of the rock, a wave surge tumbled one so kh
that he could not right again. The other snail((6/32') gained the
rock and soon attached himself by mucus. Of the thirty, then.
only one was able to get to the rock. The others closed and
would be caught by the incoming tide.
One of the problems the snails encountered was sand-miring
of their feet. This was a hazard to larger snails (14/32" and
above) particularily because adhering sand grains prevented
complete closure of their opercula.
