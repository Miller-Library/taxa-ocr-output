consisted of the daily census of an isolated population on top
of a rock accessible to birds. Some individuals were painted u
unnatural colors to test the chance that birds would eat the
snails if they could see them better. The experiment was dis-
continued at the end of thirty days with negative results.
Birds would perch on therock, but evidence of their eating the
snails was never found.
Hemigrapsus nudus and Pachygrapsus crassipes were prime
suspects because they frequent the L. planaxis range. Nether
of these crabs was observed feeding on L. planaxis in thefield
nor could they be induced to eat the snails in the laboratory.
Cancer antennarius consummed without hesitation great
quantities of L' planaxis under lab conditions. Since this
animal is a visitor to the upper mid tide zone at the flood
tide (determined by trapping a few individuals at the base of
L. planaxis covered cliffs), it should be considered a definite
hazard to the L. planaxis that are accidentally dislodged from
the rocks. C. productus is a rarer crab in this area. The one
speciment tested would not eat planaxis, but he would not eat
dead fish either. The question remains open as to his predator
potential.
7. The Hermit crabs of the genus Pagurus would not attack a
living L. planaxis, although they would remove the soft parts
of a dead snail and clean the shell for a futurehome site.
8.
Thais emarginata was never observed eating L. planaxis nor
could they be induced to eat them even after three weeks of
starvation. I would not write off thepossiblity of their being
a predator, but the incidence of
Thais attacks must be slight.
9. The Bat Star Patiria miniata
eats L. planaxis in the labor-
atory. So does Leptasterias
zu ttla.
Although none of these
