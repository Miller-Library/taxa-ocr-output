populations I have observed, this would seem to betherule rather
than an exception. All individuals found below 5/32" were im-
bedded in crevices and chinks in the rock; individuals between
5-8/32" were found in protected areas not exposed to heavy
surf. Snails below8/32" are not commen on vertical faces exposed
to heavy surf and neither are individuals greater than 18/32"
The extremes in sizes apparently must be sheltered from the
direct force of the waves.
The question of where the inchoate rock-dwelling snails
appear on a vertical index could not be answered by this study.
The smallest individual collected was 4/32" and was from Oco Fa2:2.
In summary then the following things are apparent: The
dominant size class of snails in May 1964 was between 11 and 14/32":
as a general rule the smaller snails are found lower on a verti-
cal index, but this rule is tempered by factors such as degree
of spray and wave action, and the frequency andposition of
crevices in a population range.
