tide, they represent a threat to the dislodged snails.
10. Anthropleura xanthogrammica would alwys take in any L.
planaxis dropped onto its fringe, but, as described in Ricketts
& Calvin, the snails would be disgorged alive later.
In summary then, the most significant predator on L. planaxis
in Acanthina spirata. The other predators —-Cancer antennarius,
Cancer productus, and the starfish— are encountered by the
snails only when they are under water.
Acanthina spirata
In the field, Acanthina attacks were frequently observed
but these attacks were encountered only on a special type of
shore: regions where there are may little tidepools with numbers
of L. planaxis around their surfaces. If the snails are dislod-
ged and fall into pools, or if they venture below the water line
persuing their own activities, they are susceptible to attack
by Acanthina. In no instance did I or any one else working with
Acanthina observe a capture that wasnt under water.
The table below is a tabulation of L. planaxis shells recovered
from Hermit crabs. The percentage of these shells drilled by
Acanthina is also given.
