MFASURING
To measure the size of Littorina planaxis the following method
was adopted. This method is better than the common spire
length system because L. planaxis are very susceptible to
erosion of their spires. The snail isoriented with the lip of
the shell opening as in the figure. Themeasure is taken by
placing one point of a caliper at the widest part of the great
whorl opposite the lip, the other at the fringe of the lip.
