POPULATION
In order to gain an appreciation of thesize and distribution
of the snails comprising the Littorina planaxis population, it
was necessary to sample various ardas along theshore and from
these samples to try to construct a meaningful picture of the
structure of the population.
The sampling was accomplished by first selecting an area.
Since this was not to be an extensive sampling project and the
numbers of individuals would be relatively small, the areas
were selected to be as varied in amount of splash and wave shock
as possible. In all nine areas along the shore were sampled:
three populations from a protected shore (226), two from
heavy wave shock areas (2:34), one from a semi-protected beach
(2/), and three from an area where there was a great deal of
spray but little direct wave shock (42:5 ). These areas are
indicated on the map preceding this page.
Once an area was selected, the height of the lowest indivi-
dual snail in thepopulation to be tested was determined by meas-
uring his distance from the water line at that instant above the
0.O' tide. The figures for water height above 0.0' tide were
determined by reference to three Benchmarks of known height that
are positioned in the rocks on shore. Readings from the bench
marks to the water line were made at ten minute intervals during
the time that the heights of the various selected populations
were being determined.
Once the height of the lowest individual was established,
the upward range of the population was marked off in one-foot
intervals. The width of the grid was two feet; each vertical
