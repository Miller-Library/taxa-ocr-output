CAUSES OF DEATR
Predators
The following possible predators occur within or close to
the L. planaxis populations: California Ground Squirrel; Oyster
Catchers; Herring Gull; Plover; Sandpiper
Hemigrapsus nudus;
Pachygrapsus crassipes; Cancer antennarius; C. productus; Pagurus
spp.; Acanthina spirata; Thais emarginata; Patiria miniata:
Leptosterias pusilla; Pisaster ochraceous, Anthropleura elegan-
tissima and A. xanthogrammica.
Theses predators will be considered in order except for the
carnivorous whelk Acanthina spirata which, because of its sign-
ificance, will be considered later.
1. California Ground Squirrel: To find out if squirrels rec-
ognize planaxis as food two experiment s were tried. The first
consisted of placing a number of dishes containing known numbers
of L. planaxis around an area where ground squirrels were fre-
quent. In no instance was a L. planaxis eaten by squirrels
although the dishes were investigated.
The other experiment involved hand-feeding the squirrels at
Lovers and Lighthouse Points. Although the squirrels were always
curious and responded eagerly to what they assumed to be prof-
fered food, in no instance could a squirrel be induced to eat
a L. planaxis. They apparently did not recognize them as food.
2. The Oyster Catchers were never observed near L. planaxis
populations. They seemed to feed exclusively on the offshore
seaweed covered rocks.
Herring Gulls were negative also.
3.
Plovers and Sandpiperg were occasionally observed feeding
in theBalanus beds and could possibly feed on the L. scutulata
harbored there. The experiment
