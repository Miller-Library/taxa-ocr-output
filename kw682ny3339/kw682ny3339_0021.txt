I determined the upward range of Acanthina in my populatior
grids by measuring the heights of individuals in the grid or
the closest, to the grid if none was present in the grid itself.
These measuremerts were made at mid-tide because it was too
inconvenient (and dangerous in some places) to make the measure-
ments at high water.
Theresults of these measurements were that Acanthina appar-
ently does not range much morethan two feet above the Balanus
beds except when found in tidepools as described above.
From what I and others (Karin Rohe and Ken Tittle) have
observed, the capture and feeding must take place under water.
A particularly successful stalk and capture by Acanthina is
illustrated in figure ?.
A seriesof experiments was performed to determine reactions
of Acanthina to L. planaxis and vice versa.
1. Five Acanthina and 100 L. planaxis were placed in an aquarium
andobserved daily for a week. Since the L. planaxis all fled the
water and crawled as far above the surface as possible, it was
necessary to knock them into the water occasionally so that the
Acanthina wouldhave a chance to capture them.
I observed four attacks by Acanthina during theweek. In
the first, I did not see the capture. The Acanthina was rocking
the L. planaxis, his attack being made against the columella.
Judging from otherattacks observed, this would seem to be the
preferred position, although it is definitely not the only
position. The Acanthina was joined at intervals by two other
Acanthina. The three of them all but completely covered the L.
planaxis. In six hours they hadquit the snail. Although all
three had apparently participated in devouring the snail, there
was only one drill hole.
