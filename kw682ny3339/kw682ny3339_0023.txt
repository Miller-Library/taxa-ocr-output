2. In about 10 cases feeding Acanthina were removed from their
prey and then replaced near it again. About half of theindiv-
iduals tested resumed their attack immediately. Theother half
showed no interest in feeding and could not be induced to repeat
an attack even when fresh sea water and then a fresh snail were
substituted for water in which the capture took place and then
the captured snail.
3. From the snail shell table above it is apparent that the
heaviest incidence of drilling occurs on snails from 10/32-
13/32". To test to see if this is a preferred size for a special
reason, Acanthina were attached to the backs of various sized
snails. I found thatI could not make an Acanthina remain at-
tached to a snail below 8/32"; snails larger than 14/32" could
drag an Acanthina weighing 4.82 grams up out of thewater and
hang on until the Acanthina eventually dropped off. On the basis
of these two observations, the Acanthina apparently prefers
snails between 8 and 14/32" because they are large enough to
attach to and small enough to be too weak to escape by crawling
up out of the water.
In summary, from the observation of a successful attack by
an Acanthina on a snail measuring 12/32"
it would appear that
a L. planaxis iseasy prey for a truly hungry snail, however there
are conditions that must be met before an Acanthina can encounter
a periwinkle. The incidence of Acanthina predation is highest
in those areas where there are small tide pools below the litt-
orine covered rocks. For convenience and ease of capture snails
between 10 and 14/32" seem to be preferred, although it must
be pointed out that snails between 10 and 14/32" comprise the
bulk of the population and are therefore the size range most
Eintered by Acant'ina. Thetwenty per cent drilling
