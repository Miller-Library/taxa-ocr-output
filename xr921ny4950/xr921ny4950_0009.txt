does not occur in lipase and takes place quickly in pronase and trypsin,
No difference was noted in the sensitivity to digestion of fertilized and
unfertilized eggs.
The fertilization membrane of the urchin S. purpuratus was found
to be sensitive to both lipase and pronase, although the latter digestion
occurs more slowly. P. ochraceus eggs are lipase-insensitive and pronase
and trypsin-sensitive, analogous to colonial tunicates.
Comparison of the investments of colonial and solitary tunicate
eggs was done with the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 2a-d). It is
interesting to note the relative size of the eggs: colonial tunicate eggs.
with a mean diameter of about 250u, being 3-4 times as large as solitary
ones. Follicle cells are much more pronounced in the latter, appearing
as a single layer of elongated conical-shaped cells attached to the
outer surface of the chorion. Pitted surfaces can be seen, most likely
corresponding to vacuoles. Conversely, in the colonial tunicate eggs.
follicle cells appear as thin, symmetrical cells pressed flat onto the
chorion. The structure of the chorion also seems to be a thicker, more
complex and intricate matrix in the eggs of the solitary tunicates.
DISCUSSION
Most research on eggs has been done from a developmental perspective.
It is interesting however to look from an ecological viewpoint and focus
on the problem of survival of eggs and developing embryos. This study
