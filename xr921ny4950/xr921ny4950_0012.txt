also function as a further barrier against digestion.
Organisms have developed two basic strategies of reproduction
(Thorson, 1949): producing few eggs and taking good care of them, or
producing many eggs and releasing them immediately. Many marine inverte¬
brates, including urchins and starfish, favor the latter strategy.
Tunicates, however, present both patterns, which seem to roughly correlate
with the social organization of the individual species: colonial ascidians
tend to brood few eggs (Fig. 3), while solitary ascidians spawn many
thousands (Fig. 4).
Solitary tunicates deal with the problem of survival of spawned
eggs by the brevity of the pelagic embryonic stage (18-20 hours), post¬
poning the more involved processes of development and growth until the
benthic post-metamorphic stage. Pelagic eggs, however, are still presented
with the problem of being eaten. Spawned ascidian eggs especially are
in danger of digestion by the parent tunicate - out the atrial siphon
and into the oral one (Fig. 4).
In the scope of this study, it was seen that spawned eggs and
embryos have a protease-insensitive investment and not only are able to
pass through the digestive tract of the adult A. ceratodes undisturbed,
but embryonic development continues to the larval stage. It is therefore
suggested that there is a comparable survival strategy among some marine
invertebrates; namely, a protease-insensitive extra-embryonic membrane,
such as a chorion or a ferilization membrane, serves to protect the egg
and embryo from digestion by filter-feeders.
