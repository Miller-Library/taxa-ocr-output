INTRODUCTION
Many marine organisms produce eggs covered by tough membranes and
coats. Not only does this packaging make the eggs difficult to study, but
removal of these layers is accomplished only by strenuous means (Berg,
1967). This has long been a point of interest among invertebrate embryol¬
ogists, generating some rather creative solutions, such as digestion by
crab stomach juice (Berrill, 1932) and popping eggs out of a pipette and
lancing their investments with a tungsten needle (Muneoka, 1979).
This study centers on ascidian eggs, which are unique in the
intricacies of their extra-embryonic membranes. Two species of echinoderm
eggs were also briefly examined. The tunicate egg (Fig. 1) is covered by
vacuolated cells, known as test cells, which float more or less freely in
the perivitelline space. They are surrounded by a non-cellular envelope,
the chorion, upon which is attached another set of highly vacuolated cells,
the follicle cells (Reverberi, 1971). Many functions have been suggested
for these extra-cellular packagings. The chorion, the focus of this study,
is often noted to be the site of specific sperm recognition and is thought
to be responsible for preventing polyspermy, self-fertility, and inter¬
specific fertilization (Rosati and DeSantis, 1978). The chorion is also
considered to be the binding site of the spermatozoa (DeSantis et al., 1979).
although the presence of an acrosome in the ascidian spermatozoon has been
a matter of discussion (Kubo et al., 1978; Woollacott, 1977).
This paper demonstrates a further ecological function of this
extra-embryonic investment: that of protection of the egg against digestion
by filter-feeders. Eggs of both solitarytunicates, which are normally
