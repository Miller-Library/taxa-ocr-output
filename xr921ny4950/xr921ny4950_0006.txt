Eggs from the ascidians, A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis, were
fertilized with fresh sperm in pH 9 sea water (C. Lambert, personal
communication), and fertilization was assessed 2-4 hours later by evidence
of cleavage. A series of mechanically defolliculated and enzymatically
dechorionated eggs and tadpoles were also prepared, as well as P. ochrageus
and fertilized and unfertilized S. purpuratus eggs.
In order to assess digestion of eggs by the filter-feeding adult.
mature A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis were placed in a glass bowl, so
that uningested eggs could be easily recovered. A relatively dense susÂ¬
pension of eggs (300-350/ml sea water) and carmine, a biological marker.
was prepared and the number of eggs in 1 ml aliquots were counted under a
light microscope. A pasteur pipette was carefully placed just outside
the oral siphon of the adult and known aliquots were added dropwise to
the incoming feeding current. Animals were then put back into running
sea water to insure a constant food supply and the uningested eggs were
immediately recovered from the bottom of the bowl and the quantity noted.
The carmine labelled fecal pellets were recovered 6-26 hours later, washed
well in filtered sea water, and observed under a light microscope. The
number of intact and damaged eggs found in the fecal pellets was assessed.
and embryos were further incubated in fresh sea water at 12 to assay
the continuation of development.
Enzymatic digestion:
Digestion of the extra-embyonic investments was tested with;
Crude porcine pancreatic lipase (Sigma) (lmg/ml) and 10 mM dithiothreitol.
