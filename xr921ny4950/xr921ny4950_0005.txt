out the ovary, which was then minced and filtered through a Nitex screen.
This preparation was washed three times by centrifugation in Ca-free
artificial sea water, and the oocytes were resuspended in filtered sea

water and stored at 12
Removal of follicle cells:
The follicle cells of A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis were
removed mechanically by drawing the eggs up into a syringe and forcing
them through a tip of small enough aperture to approximate the diameter
of the chorion. A standard 31-gauge needle was successful.
Removal of the chorion:
Eggs were dechorionated enzymatically, according to a procedure
developed by Dr. Charles Lambert of California State University at
Fullerton, using crude porcine pancreatic lipase (Sigma) (lmg/ml) and
10 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma) at 16 and pH 9.1. Due to the fragility
of the dechorionated eggs, fresh eggs were placed in a supporting cylinÂ¬
drical tube, whose bottom had been removed and lined with a 50 u Nitex
mesh. The enzyme-egg suspension was stirred constantly with a plastic
paddle until observation under a light microscope demonstrated that
753 of the eggs were free of their extracellular investments (about 3
hours). The dechorionated eggs were then washed three times in filtered
sea water, using the Nitex mesh support.
