centered on spawned and brooded tunicate eggs, resulting in the discovery
of the ability of those spawned to resist digestion by filter-feeders.
presumably by means of a protease-insensitive extra-embryonic membrane.
This study shows that when a series of eggs of solitary tunicates
are fed to adult A. ceratodes, only those with a chorion are recovered
intact and continue to develop. The chorion therefore seems to function
as a protective device against digestion by filter-feeders. Two modes
of action are proposed: the chorion is impermeable to normal digestive
enzymes and the egg itself is very delicate and the chorion serves as
a supporting envelope, protecting the egg from mechanical fragmentation.
The latter idea is supported by the observed fragility of the enzymatically
dechorionated egg (Reverberi, 1971); however, this fragility may have reÂ¬
sulted from incubation in the enzymes. On the other hand, tadpoles.
which have much more formal integrity, yet no chorion, are also digested.
suggesting that enzyme action may be more important,
Fully-packaged eggs of colonial tunicates are rarely recovered
intact. These eggs are normally brooded and would never be presented
with the problem of digestion by filter-feeders in the wild. The chorions
of these eggs are easily digested by pronase and trypsin,

are not. The membrane appears to be sensitive to 0.58 pronase, however
proteolytic digestion occurs much more slowly than in the colonial ascidian
eggs. The change in protease sensitivity of the Stronglyocentrotus egg
noted by Berg (1967) during the first few minutes after insemination is
thought to be caused by crosslinking of tyrosyl residues producing an
