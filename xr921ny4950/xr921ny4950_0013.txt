ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Dr. David Epel for his suggestions and
encouragement during my work. The unlimited enthusiasm and energy of Dr.
Donald P. Abbott proved an invaluable inspiration. And a special note of
thanks goes to Carl Johnson for his patience, insight, and enthusiastic
support.
