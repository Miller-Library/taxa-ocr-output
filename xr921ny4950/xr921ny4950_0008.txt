after removal from the animal). Eggs fertilized prior to ingestion do
continue to develop and 448 hatch into normal viable tadpoles. Similar
results were seen in the mechanically defolliculated eggs.
A different type of result was seen in those eggs of solitary
tunicates which had been enzymatically dechorionated. Only 1-38 were
recovered intact in the fecal pellets. Furthermore, ingested live tadpoles
were only found in fragments after ingestion by the adult.
The eggs and embryos of the colonial ascidians do not pass through
the digestive tract of A. ceratodes intact. Less than 38 of the whole eggs
and embryos ingested were recovered unharmed.
Unfertilized eggs of S. purpuratus appeared to be digested, whereas
fertilized eggs (2-cell stage) with a fertilization membrane were recovered
intact. It appeared that cleavage had progressed, but further develop¬
ment was not assessed.
Unfertilized P. ochraceus eggs caused a most violent rejection
response, consisting of immediate closure of both siphons, body contrac¬
tion, and then a forceful ejection of water from the oral siphon. However,
those eggs which were ingested by means of forceful and persistent feeding.
were rarely recovered intact in the fecal pellets.
In vitro digestion experiments were also carried out on the
various eggs and the results are summarized in Table II. Eggs of the
solitary tunicates, A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis, appear to be
pronase and trypsin-insensitive and digestable by lipase. However, when
placed in lipase for ten minutes and then put into a protease solution.
dechorionation occurs quickly. Digestion of the chorion of eggs of the
colonial tunicates, C. huntsmani and Botryllus sp., on the other hand,
