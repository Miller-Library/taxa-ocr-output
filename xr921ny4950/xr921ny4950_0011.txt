elevated, hard, DTT-insoluble fertilization membrane (Foerder and
Shapiro, 1977). The increased intricacies of the membrane is comparable
to the more organized chorion in solitary tunicate eggs than in colonials,
The correlation between the protease-insensitivity of the membranes
of solitary tunicates and urchins and their resistance to digestion by
adult A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis is fascinating. The observations
that eggs without these investments are not recovered intact from fecal
pellets seems to put the barrier to digestion at the chorion and fertiliza¬
tion membrane.
Solitary ascidian eggs only respond to protease after a short treat¬
ment with lipase. Lipid content in the chorion has been demonstrated by
various staining procedures (M. Poenie, personal communication). This seems
to suggest that lipids somehow mask the proteins in the chorion membrane.
as a protective device against proteolytic digestion. The hypothesis
of the hatching enzyme in A. ceratodes as a trypsin-like compound (Berrill,
1932) would suggest that this masking effect is found only on the external
surface of the chorion. It is noteworthy that lipase also dissolves the
fertilization membrane of S. purpuratus; further investigation seems to
be warranted concerning the lipid content of this investment,
Unfertilized starfish eggs seem to attack the problem of digestion
from another angle: prevention of ingestion. Ingested P. ochraceus eggs
cause a violent ejection reaction, although eggs comparable in size, such
as those of A. ceratodes, are ingested easily. Perhaps saponin compounds
found in Pisaster eggs (Ikegami et al., 1967) function to provide a chem¬
ical defense against potential predators. The fertilization membrane could
