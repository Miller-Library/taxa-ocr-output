Eggs from solitary and colonial tunicates were fed to adult Ascidia
ceratodes and Ciona intestinalis. Those eggs which are normally spawned,
A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis, were recovered unharmed from fecal
pellets and embryonic development observed to continue. Dechorionated
eggs and viable tadpoles, however, were digested. Furthermore, eggs which
are invariably brooded, those of Clavelina huntsmani and Botryllus sp.,
were not recovered intact. Fertilized Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus eggs
were also able to survive ingestion by the adult A. ceratodes. A correlation
was noted between protease-insensitivity of the chorion and fertilization
membrane and the resistance to digestion. It is suggested that the proteoÂ¬
lytic insensitivity of the extra-embryonic investments serves to protect
eggs normally spawned from digestion by filter-feeding adult tunicates.
