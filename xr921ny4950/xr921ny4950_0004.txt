spawned, and colonial tunicates, whose eggs are brooded, are examined.
along with sea urchin and starfish eggs. Given the limited number of
eggs studied, it appears that those eggs which are spawned correlate with
a much greater degree of proteolytic insensitivity. It is suggested that
this protease insensitivity of the extra-embryonic chorion confers the
ability to survive ingestion by the adult.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Handling of gametes:
Adult tunicates were obtained during April and May from the interÂ¬
tidal region at Mussel Point and from the fouling communities of the
Monterey Marina in Pacific Grove, Ca., and kept in running sea water at
100
12 . Gametes were removed with a pasteur pipette from the gonaducts of
the solitary ascidians, Ascidia ceratodes and Ciona intestinalis, and from
the atrial chamber of the colonial ones, Clavelina huntsmani and Botryllus,
sp. Eggs were rinsed three times in paper filtered sea water and kept in
sea water at 12
; undiluted sperm of the solitary tunicates were used
fresh or stored for several hours at 40.
The shedding of Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus gametes was induced
by an intracoelomic injection of 0.5M KCl. The eggs were stored in
filtered sea water at 12 and the undiluted sperm kept at 40
Immature oocytes of Pisaster ochraceus were obtained by dissecting
