griseus (Sigma) (5 mg/ml), pH 7.8; and Trypsin,,2X crystallized from
bovine pancreas, dialyzed and lyophilized (Sigma) (5mg/ml), pH 7.6.
All experiments were carried out at 16, using a dilute egg concentra¬
tion (no greater than a monolayer) and effectiveness of digestion scored
as noted above.
Scanning electron microscopy:
Eggs of A. ceratodes, C. intestinalis, C. huntsmani, and Botryllus
sp. were fixed in 18 gluteraldehyde, 18 formaldehyde, 708 sea water, and
1.28 HEPES, pH 7.3. When preparing the mounts for gold spattering, the
eggs were gently squashed so as to cause some fragmentation of the extra¬
cellular layers.
RESULTS
Table I summarizes the fate of ingested eggs by adult A. ceratodes.
Parallel experiments were also carried out with C. intestinalis, with
similar results, although a strict numerical analysis was not done.
The eggs of the solitary tunicates, which had acomplete set of extra¬
cellular layers when fed to the adults, are found intact in fecal pellets.
except for the loss of follicle cells. These eggs do not fertilizé after
passing through the digestive tract; however control eggs, which were not
fed to the animals, also don't fertilize (most likely due to storage time
