Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
(3)
The host fish generally attempted to dislodge newly attached
isopods. The Pointed-nosed Sole Parophrys vetulus rapidly
quivered the entire body, while the Curl-fin Sole Pleuronicthys
coenosus vigorously contorted the whole body. Although
P. coenosus was relatively effective in dislodging isopods,
P. vetulus rarely dislodged them. For this reason only P. vetulus
was used in experiments described later.
This behavior of L. vulgaris and host fish was observed
throughout the entire six week study, indicating both host and
parisite have highly stereotyped behavioral patterns.
SENSORY CAPABILITIES OF L. VULGARIS
IN HOST LOCATION
A 20 gallon aquarium containing a single uninfested
P. vetulus was placed in complete darkness. Twenty larval
L. vulgaris were then introduced. The number of isopods infesting
the fish after six hours was counted. An identical experiment
was run concurrently in constant light as a control. The results
from four runs are shown in figure 1.
The data in figure 1 indicate light, and therefore visual
stimulation, is not essential in host location by larval
L. vulgaris.
