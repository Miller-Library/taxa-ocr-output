Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
(1)
The marine parasitic isopod Lironeca vulgaris (Stimpson)
is frequently found on several species of fish inhabiting
Pacific Ocean coastal waters of the United States. I have
observed the isopod in the gill chambers of the flatfishes
Parophrys vetulus, Pleuronicthys coenosus, and Citharicthys sp.,
and the sculpin Leptocottus armatus from Monterey Bay, California.
It also occurred in the rockfish Sebastes sp., the Ling Ophiodon
elongatus, and the salmon Oncorhyncus kisutch in coastal waters
off Southern Oregon. It is likely the parasite infests other
fishes aside from those listed. Its distribution is from Baja
California to Washington State (Schultz, 1969).
The objective of this study was to determine behavior patterns
and sensory capabilities utilized by larval Lironeca vulgaris to
locate hosts after release from the marsupium of the adult female.
The mechanisms of host finding looked for were (1) active use of
sense organs of the isopod to locate host fish from a distance.
followed by pursuit by the larval isopod, (2) ingestion of the
isopod by a host fish, with subsequent attachment of the isopod
to the interior of the mouth and movement by the isopod from the
mouth into the gill chamber, and (3) random movement by the
isopod until chance contact with the host fish occurred.
