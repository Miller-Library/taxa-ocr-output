Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgari
(6)
Throughout the six week study larval Lironeca vulgaris were
observed on at least 30 occasions to pass within ten centimeters
of the host fish without any visible reaction. The above work
indicates L. vulgaris does not use vision or chemoreception
as a means of locating hosts beyond a few centimeters distant.
It is conceivable that flatfish are infested by random
movement of the isopods, as indicated by the following model.
Flatfish population data was taken off Hopkins Marine Station
in Monterey Bay, using an otter trawl at depths between 20 and
28 meters. The data is shown in table 2.
A conservative estimate of the surface area of an average
sized adult flatfish is 100 cm2. A strip 10 cm. in width rep-
resents a mean between maximum probability of contact (fish
oriented perpendicular to the path of the isopod) and minimum
probability of contact (fish oriented parallel to the path of
the isopod). The width of a swath formed by a swimming isopod
is therefore 10 cm. Undamaged one to four day old larvae were
rarely observed resting during the six week study. For the
purposes of this model the larvae are considered to be constantly
swimming. Larval speed is constant at a conservative three
centimeters per second in this model. Isopod larvae in aquaria
generally swam in straight lines until diverted by obstructions.
Isopods will therefore swim in straight lines for model purposes.
Hence the area an isopod covers in four days is 1036 me, calculated
