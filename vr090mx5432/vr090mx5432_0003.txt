Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
BEHAVIOR OF FREE-SWIMMING LARVAL
LIRONECA VULGARIS
Adult female L. vulgaris containing well-developed brood
were isolated individually in aerated containers. Brood
released from the marsupium and placed in a larger aquarium
moved to the upper and lighted part of an aquarium, generally
for the first four to eight hours. They then began swimming
near the bottom of the aquarium, touching it at relatively
regular intervals. Average distance between touchings was
4.1 cm. (values ranged from two to twelve centimeters) in 26
measurements. Swimming speed during this activity was between
3 cm. and 4 cm. per second. Little variation in swimming speed
was noted during the first four days after release from the
marsupium. No systematic pattern of swimming was noted.
Occasionally the isopod would skim along the bottom, appearing
to maintain continuous contact with it.
When larval isopods contacted a host they immediately
attached using the anterior peraeopods. The contact-recognition-
attachment sequence was rapid, requiring less than four seconds.
The isopods used were released from the marsupium in vitro;
consequently they had never been in contact with fish before.
The immediacy of the contact-recognition-attachment sequence
therefore indicates a genetically programed behavioral pattern.
