Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
APPENDIX
NOTES ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF
L. VULGARIS
(1) Damage to gill filiments by isopods could be extensive.
Three or more large isopods could prevent closing of the
operculum of the host, resulting in death of the host. None
of the approximately 300 flatfish examined carried more than
three parasites. This suggests the existence of a mechanism
or behavior which limits the number of isopods per fish.
(2) Effective Lethal Time 50 was recorded for 30 starved
larval isopods, with 30 fed isopods as a control. ELT-50 was
defined as the time elapsed before half the isopods examined
could not swim when stimulated by a current of water from an
eye dropper. Fifteen of the thirty isopods were dead or could
not swim at the end of six days.
(3) Adult L. vulgaris of both sexes survived on a diet of
dead fish for at least three weeks.
(4) Adult L. vulgaris did not die after releasing larvae.
Size variation of 100 brooding females ranged from approximately
one gram to 3.25 grams. This suggests the possibility of
multiple broods by females. The suggestion is reinforced by
the observation of immature eggs in the ovary of a female already
