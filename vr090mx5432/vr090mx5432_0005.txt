Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
The following tests for chemoreception were done. A styro-
foam tank was fitted with 125 ml. flasks opening into either
end (figure 2).
A piece of P. vetulus approximately l cm2 was placed in one
flask. It had previously been observed that Lironeca vulgaris
fed readily on dead P. vetulus. Water was introduced into the
tank slowly to establish an unmixed gradient of fish scent.
Ten larval L. vulgaris were introduced and observed approximately
every two hours during daylight for two days. The experiment
was repeated using 20 larval isopods. At no time during the
experiments were isopods observed in either flask.
In another experiment a live P. vetulus was confined to a
single area on a large piece of plankton netting for two hours
and then removed, leaving some of the protective slime coating
on the mesh. The slime area was outlined in pencil and the
netting was stapled into an aquarium parallel to the bottom.
The aquarium was filled and approximately 15 larval isopods were
introduced. Normal larval swimming behavior was observed outside
the slime area. No larvae stopped swimming outside the slime
area during three hours of observations. At least five isopods
attached to the netting within the slime area for longer than
20 seconds following actual contact with the netting. Swimming
activity was resumed after halting, however, indicating the
