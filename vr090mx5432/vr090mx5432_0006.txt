Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgar

slime was not sufficient stimulus for permanent attachment.
Isopods swimming over the slime area without actually contacting
the mesh did not stop.
A choice experiment was run utilizing a Y-joint and a gentle
current which forced larvae to choose between a tank containing
a live fish and an empty control tank (figure 3).
The two tanks were filled with an equal volume of water.
A single P. vetulus was placed in one tank. Water dripping from
the excurrent capillary tube caused a slight current. All
tubing and the entire Y-joint was wrapped with black electrical
tape to eliminate light gradients. Larval isopods were inserted
in pairs into the introduction tube using an eye dropper, and
were removed when they emerged from the tubing into the tank.
The choice was then recorded.
Current flow from each tank was shown to be equal after the
experiment by putting methylene blue in one tank. A clear
division between blue water from one tank and colorless water
from the other was established down the exact center of the
choice chamber (figure 3).
Data on choice of 74 larvae is shown in table 1. The
presence of the fish had no clear effect on the choice of tube.
