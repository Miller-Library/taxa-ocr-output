Host locating Abilities of L. vulgaris

by (speed) X (time) X (swath width). Since the flatfish popu-
lation density was calculated to be roughly one fish per 65 me
the isopod covers approximately 15 times the area necessary to
find a single host. The chances of finding a host are undoubtedly
reduced by such factors as predation or environmental stress.
However, this rough model indicates that out of a brood of 300
larvae there is an excellent chance that one will infest a host
through random swimming activity, thereby increasing the isopod
population or at least keeping the population constant.
Random swimming cannot account for the infestation of the
active bottom fish Ophiodon elongatus or the pelagic salmon
Oncorhyncus kisutch. Both species are quick enough to easily
avoid isopods yet are occasionally infested. Six juvenile
0. elongatus between 12 and 16 cm. in length were exposed to
free swimming L. vulgaris. There was no reaction using three
larvae between four and five millimeters in length. Three
isopods between 1.0 and 1.5 cm. in length were ingested, but
all three attached to the interior of the mouth and subsequently
crawled into the gill chamber. An unidentified tidepool sculpin
took a one centimeter long isopod, which then crawled out the
mouth, over the operculum, and into the gill from the outside. In
all four observations the isopod avoided being swallowed. Thus
ingestion is a possible means by which these fish become infested.
No flatfishes were seen feeding on isopods.
