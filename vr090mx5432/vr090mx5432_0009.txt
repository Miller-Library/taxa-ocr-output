Host Locating Abilities of L. vulgaris
(8)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
This investigation indicated larval L. vulgaris were inca-
pable of sensory perception of host fish without physical contact
between isopod and fish. Random activity as a means of infesting
flatfish was shown a possibility using behavioral studies in
combination with a brief study of flatfish population densities.
Infestation by the feeding upon the isopod by fish was
shown physically possible, and provided a logical explanation for
the occurence of the parasitic isopod on pelagic fish.
Much work remains to be done on this subject.
