Trace Metal Levels in Intertidal
Molluscs of California
Abstract
Determinations of Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were made by
atomic absorption spectrophotometry on 7 species of Mollusca in the
genera Acmaea, Tegula, Thais (gastropods), and Mytilus, Protothaca,
and Tapes (bivalves). Eleven regions along the California coast
from San Francisco Bay to Los Angeles were included. Separate
analyses were performed on shells, and on soft portions of whole
bodies. Highest levels, above 900 ppm Pb were found in bodies
of Acmaea digitalis, 570 ppm Cu and 1700 ppm Zn in bodies of
Thais emarginata.
