The author wishes to express thanks to the faculty, staff, and


graduate students of Hopkins Marine Station, especially to Dr. Donald
P. Abbott for his encouragement and many indispensible suggestions
both during research and while writing the manuscript. Dr. John H.
Martin provided additional helpful criticism and a general knowledge
of the problems of trace metal analysis. Both to them and to Mr. George
Knauer and Mr. S. John Chang, I owe gratitude for inspiration furnished
during this study.
