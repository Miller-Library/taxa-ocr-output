per day on weekends, many of which have been seen to park within 5 feet
of the wall on which Acmaea were found. In addition, this locality is
situated directly under the Golden Gate Bridge. The very high levels
of Pb in Acmaea digitalis bodies at this point perhaps reflect not only
the high Pb fallout from auto exhaust, but also the fact that this species
lives on, and feeds from rock surfaces not thoroughly rinsed by their
submersion at high tides each day. Lead has no known usefulness in bio-
logical systems, and is known to inhibit certain enzymes.
Cadmium and Zinc
Cadmium in shells was highest in Mytilus at Carmel Bay (I), in Tapes
at Coyote Point (A), and Tegula at Fisherman's Wharf (F). Body values are
most sizable in Acmaea at White's Point (K) and Thais at the Wharf (F).
Cadmium is toxic to living systems because it can replace Zn, an important
component of metalloproteins such as carbonic anhydrase. Zinc metal in the
environment, however, often contains substantial amounts of Od as a contamÂ¬
inant, which might explain the high correlations of Cd and Zn in bodies of
maea and Thais.
Zinc was the most abundant trace metal in the soft parts of molluscs,
as it is in seawater; values in the body were at least 20 times higher than
in the shell. High amounts of Zn in bodies of Thais at Fisherman's Wharf,
1700 ppm, and of Acmaea at White's Point (K), 763 ppm, may be correlated
with location. In motor-driven marine vessels, it is almost universal to
have Zn blocks fastened to the hull, near the propeller to protect it and
the drive shaft from electrolysis in sea water. These blocks, higher in
the electromotive-force series than iron and brass, slowly go into solution
and need replacement at regular intervals. Fisherman's Wharf, as noted
earlier, lies in a harbor, while at White's Point (K) the collecting siteer.
