is less than 4 miles from the Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor, where many
hundreds of boats are moored. Zinc has been found to be concentrated by
brown algae (Black and Mitchell, 1952) 40 times that in sea water.
Mytilus edulis
It is perhaps noteworthy that levels of trace metals in Mytilus edulis
from California show a number of agreements with those of the same species
in New Zealand (Table 3) as determined by Brooks and Rumsby (1965). Dif-
ferenceslocalities and methods of analysis, however, should be taken
into consideration in any comparisons made.
Summary
Determinations of Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were made by
atomic absorption spectrophotometry on 7 species of Mollusca in the
genera Acmaea, Tegula, Thais (gastropods), and Mytilus, Protothaca,
and Tapes (bivalves). Eleven regions along the California coast from
San Francisco Bay to Los Angeles were included. Separate analyses were
performed on shells and soft portions of whole bodies. Highest levels.
above 900 ppm Pb found in bodies of Acmaea digitalis, 570 ppm Cu in
Tegula funebralis and 1700 ppm Zn in Thais emarginata, have raised
the question of causes for these unusual levels.
