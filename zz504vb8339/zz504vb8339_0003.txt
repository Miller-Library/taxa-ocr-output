included two herbivorous gastropods, one predatory snail, two bivalves
living on hard substrata, and two burrowing clams, as follows:
Acmaea digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833
Tegula funebralis (Adams, 1854)
Thais emarginata (Deshayes, 1839)
Mytilus californianus (Conrad, 1837
tilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758
Protothaca staminea (Conrad, 1837)
Tapes semidecussata (Reeve, 1864)
All species were collected alive, from the lowest portions of their
intertidal ranges. Animals were kept in filtered sea water for 24 hours
to purge sediments and gut contents. Before removal of soft parts, com¬
mensal organisms were removed, and the external surfaces of the shells
were cleaned with a non-metallic brush. Bivalves were placed in a 60°0.
oven for 15 minutes to cause opening, while gastropods were cracked
carefully in a vice. Bodies of both classes were then excised withaa
plastic knife, and both bodies and shells were washed with filtered sea
water and dried at 110°0. for 24 hours. The bodies of each species from
each location were pooled together to produce enough material for anal¬
ysis. From this, 3 aliquots were taken for triplicate analysis. The
same was done for shells.
Each aliquot of shell was crushed with mortar and pestle to.5-1cm
pieces. Samples of approximately .25g were used for analysis, as
experience showed that this small amount of sample, in the dilutions used,
caused less light scattering in analysis. These samples were then
placed in a 30ml pyrex beaker and weighed to the nearest .lmg. Five
