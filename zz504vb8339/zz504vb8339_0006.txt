likely possibility of Cu contamination at all localities in this study.
Chromium and Manganese
Chromium was found in relatively high amounts in bodies at two local-
ities, in Acmaea at Fort Point (B) and in Tegula at Fisherman's Wharf (F).
Shells were consistently highest at the Wharf. Body levels may relate to
possible contamination from automobiles at Fort Point (see lead, below), and
the presence of small craft in Monterey Harbor (see copper, above). Tapes
at Coyote Point (A) is also notable. tor high Cr.
High Mn levels in bodies and shells were found in animals from muddy
areas; in Mytilus and Tapes at Coyote Point (A) and in Mytilus at Elkhorn
Slough (D). Values were also high in Acmaea from Fort Point (B) and White's
Point (K). Manganese levels in shells of Tegula were first documented by
Krinsely (1959) who found 4-6 ppm in shells of live California animals, and
13-17 ppm in fossilized specimens. Most values in the present study are
above the range given for live animals. Manganese has a role as an activator
of enzyme systems that is well established.
Lead
Detection of Pb in shells was partially handicapped by high spectro-
photometric limits. High values were found in Mytilus californianus at
Half Moon Bay (C), both species of Mytilus at White's Point (K), and
especially in Acmaea at Fort Point (B), 931 ppm. These are animals which
live well up in the intertidal zone, and, near cities, they are exposed to
atmospheric fallout of Pb from automobile exhaust for much of the day.
Animals found at Half Moon Bay were in the vacinity of a sewer outfall.
White's Point, besides being directly inshore of the Los Angeles County
sewer outfall, is close to regions of heavy traffic in Los Angeles and
Long Beach. Fort Point attracts an estimated 60-100 tourist automobiles
