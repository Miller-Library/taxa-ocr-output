Results and Discussion
Levels of metals found in shells and bodies appear in tables 1 and
2, and figs. 2 and 3, and are discussed below.
Silver and Copper
Of the metals studied, Ag was distributed most uniformly in the
shells of animals examined; the highest levels,210 ppm, were found in
Acmaea at Fort Point, San Francisco (location B, in figs. and tables);
Thais and Tegula at Mussel Point (G). Body values of Ag were highest in
Tapes from Coyote Point, San Mateo (A), 7.3 ppm. Detectable amounts
(21 ppm) were found in all Tegula bodies, and consistently higher values
in the shells. Nicholls et al. (1959) have found Ag in zooplankton;
Brooks and Rumsby (1965) suggest that Ag is introduced into the digestive
system of the animals they studied (bivalves Ostrea sinuata, Pecten
novae-zelandiae and Mytilus edulis) by ingestion of plankton and suspended
particles.
Copper levels on molluscan bodies examined were up to 90 times as
high as in the shells (viz. Thais). High Cu values in Tegula,175 ppm, and
Thais, 570 ppm, from Fisherman's Wharf at Monterey Harbor (F) are probably
related, at least in part, to the presence of nearly 300 small boats
docked in the area, some only 50 yards away; the hulls of many are coated
with a Cu-based anti-fouling paint. The almost three-fold increase in
hais over Tegula may be related to the fact that the former is a preda-
cious snail and may get part of its Cu from the ingestion of herbivores
(like Tegula) or filter feeders (like Mytilus) which already contain sig-
nificant levels of Cu. Copper is an important enzyme activator and is a
constituent of hemocyanins that are present in all of the molluscs studied.
A basic physiological level for Cu cannot now be suggested, owing to the
