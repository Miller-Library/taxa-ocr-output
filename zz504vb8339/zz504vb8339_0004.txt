to oml of concentrated HOlwere added and the beaker covered with a way
watch glass. After foaming subsided, 5-6ml of 90% HNO3 were added.
Samples were shaken gently and warmed at low heat (60-70°0.) When
solutions turned clear, they were diluted with distilled water to 25ml.
Dried bodies were ground to a fine powder. Aliquots of approx-
imately lg were weighed to the nearest .lmg in a 30ml pyrex beaker.
Then 5-6ml of 70% HNO, were added; samples were covered as above, and
heated to a slow boil. If lipids were not present (visible as droplets)
samples were allowed to cool, and 2-3ml of 30% H,0, were added dropwise
to oxidize remaining organic matter. When clear, solutions were diluted
with distilled water to 25ml. If lipids were present, samples were
evaporated to dryness, then charred at 250°0. They were then cooled to
room temperature, redissolved in 90% HNO, boiled, recooled, treated
as above with Ho0, then diluted to 25ml.
Controls were run in two different ways, all steps of treatment
being identical to those with samples. Type 1 controls were blank
beakers used to compensate for contamination of samples from procedures
(handling, drying, reagents, etc.). These readings were subtracted from
sample readings. Type 2 controls were beakers containing standard
solutions of mètals at known concentrations, to measure loss. Steps
of treatment were again identical to those with samples. Results, used
to adjust sample readings, are as follows: Ag-1% loss, Cd-no loss, Or-
7 gain, Cu-7% loss, Mn-5% loss, Pby11% loss, Zn-38 loss.

All samples were analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer Atomic Absorption Spectro-
photometer, Model 303. Light scattering artifacts in Od, Pb, and Zn
were compensated for by running all samples with the Pb lamp at 222).
At this wavelength, the spectrophotometer read only background levels
of light scatter. Values from this procedure were treated as werettypell
controls, and subtracted from sample readings.
