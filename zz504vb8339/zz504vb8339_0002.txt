Trace Metal Levels in Intertidal
Molluscs of California
Introduction
A growing number of observations of potentially toxic levels
of trace elements such as lead, cadmium, and zinc in fishes and shellÂ¬
fish has focused concern on the matter of distribution of these materials
in marine organisms (Drinnan, 1966; Hardy, 1966; Houblouget al, 1954;
MeFarren et al, 1961). The interest in this field is not new. Since
the work of Cornec (1919), and Clark and Wheeler (1922), scientists have
been aware of concentration of trace metals in a variety of marine
plants and animals. Results of later studies have been compiled by
Vinogradov (1953) and Goldberg (1965); they cover many marine species,
though most of the data were obtained by analytical methods far less
accurate than those in current use.
Limited information is now available on the heavy metal content of
a number of marine molluscs in various parts of the world (e.g. Brooks
and Rumsby, 1965; Shuster and Pringle, 1968) but little has been done with
California species. In the present study, 7 species of molluscs from 11
locations in California were analyzed for their content of silver, cad-
mium, chromium, copper, manganese, lead, and zinc (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cug Mn,
Pb, Zn). While far from Comprehensive, the present survey represents an
attempt to establish baselines for existing levels, to relate these
levels to possible environmental sources, and to discover any molluscs
which exhibit particularly high levels of one or more metals.
