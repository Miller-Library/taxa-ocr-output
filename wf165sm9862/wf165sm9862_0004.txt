Designing Primers:
Using the known sequence of the noncoding region of 2A,
4B, and 40, a 20bp sequence for each gene containing a unique
sequence (with little or no repeats) and one rich in GC pairs
was found. The GC pairs are preferred over AT pairs because
of their stronger bonds (three instead of two) which are more
stable and thus permit for higher temperatures in PCR reactions.
A T74 primer was also made for the plasmid vector (see fig.
1).
PCR Reactions:
For the Polymerase Chain Reactions the doing region, 2A,
4B, and 40 gDNA were used as templates. dNTPs, TAQ enzyme and
buffer, T74 primer, along with the respective primers were added.
The reactions were carried out at 90°C for denaturing, 55°
to anneal, and 72°C to extend for 25-30 cycles.
Agarose Gel:
63 agarose gels were used for the DNA. 23 EtBr was added
to the agarose to visualize the DNA when irradiated. Ikb ladders
were used as references.
Southern Blots:
DNA Extraction:
liquid Nitrogen was used to grind the tissues.
The DNA was then chloroform extracted. The
polysaccherides were precipitated in 203 EtOH.
