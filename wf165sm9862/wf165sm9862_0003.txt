Of the family 3 specific genes were studied: 2A, 4B, and 40.
2A has a noncoding region length of about 1 kb while 4B and
4C have about a 500 bp noncoding region.
Why does Macrosystis pyrifera contain many different genes
to code for the same protein? In the Drosophila actin gene family
(which like the FCP gene family has similar coding regions with
noncoding regions of different sizes and sequences), the actin
genes were found to be developmentally regulated and tissue
specific (Fyrberg et al, 1983). In tomatoes, the CAB genes were
found to be organ/tissue specific and light regulated (Kellmann
et al, 1990). To answer this basic question gene specific probes
were made. By creating such probes the expression of these
different genes could be followed through different developmental
stages and stress responses by measuring the amount of its mRNA,
thus elucidating the presence of the various genes.
In order to make gene specific probes, gene specific primers
were designed and made. Using Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR),
we amplified the noncoding regions to use as probes on Southern
Blot Analysis to test the probe's specificity.
A light regulation experiment in which giant kelp blades
were incubated at low level light, so as to induce the production
of FCP proteins, was then set up and samples were obtained
periodically. Form these samples RNA was exptracted and a
Northern Blot was performed using radioactive labeled probes.
Our results were encouraging.
