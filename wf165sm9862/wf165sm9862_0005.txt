The DNA was precipitated in EtOH, resuspended
in water and quantitated in the spectrometer
DNA Digest:
Each gene (coding, 2A, 4B, and 40) was digested
with Sac I, Pst I, and Hind III overnight and
visualized on an agarose gel (see fig. 2).
The DNA/RNA was transferred onto a nylon
Transfer:
membrane (see fig. 3) and the membrane was then
UV irradiated to permanently bind the DNA to
the membrane.
Prehybridization: Blotted the membranes with Salmon Sperm DNA.
Added water, Klenow Buffer, GAT mix, random
primers, radioactive CTP and Klenow Enzyme.
Hybridization: 108 SSPE, 28 SDS, and water.
Exposure:
24-48 hrs.
RNA Extraction: The tissue was ground in liquid Nitrogen. RNase
free reagents used. Extracted with Chloroform. Precipitated
polysaccherides with EtOH. The RNA was precipitated with Licl
in BME. Extracted with Acid Phenol. Precipitated with NaOAc
and EtOH. Quantitated on spectrometer.
RNA Gel: 1.28 agarose, 6.68 formaldehyde gel composition. RNase
free reagents were used. Running buffer: 0.2 M MOPS, 10mM EDTA,
1OmM NaOAc, and 378 formaldehyde.
Light Regulation Experiment: filtered sea water; incubation
