The evidence obtained strongly suggests the presence of
gene specific probes. When the genes are probed with the coding
region, eight different products are found in a southern.
However, when the 2A noncoding region was used as the probe
it hybridized to only one of the eight products, strongly
suggesting gene specificity.
More experiments, however, are needed. The development
and use of gene specific probes can be extremely helpful in
future experiments. Once these probes are made they can easily
be amplified by PCR reactions. These probes could monitor the
expression of genes through the measure of the mRNA. For example,
at different depths kelp blades are exposed to different
quantities of light and so future experiments could focus on
light regulation of the FCP genes. Also, experiments focusing
on tissue specificity and developmental stages (where FCP
production in juveniles and full grown kelp with canopies are
compared) or nutrient regulation (i.e. during upwellings) can
provide invaluable to the comprehension of gene families and
their regulation. In all, gene specific probes are but the first,
but nonetheless valuable, step in elucidating the need of various
different genes to produce one protein.
