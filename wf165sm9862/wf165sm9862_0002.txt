ABSTRACT
Eight genes in Macrocystis pyrifera code for the FCP
protein. Each gene has similar coding regions but very different
noncoding regions (dissimilar sequences and sizes). From this
gene family three genes, 2A, 4B, and 4C, were studied. Gene
specific primers were made and challenged with positive results.
These primers were used in PCR reactions to make gene specific
probes. The gene specificities of the probes were tested using
Southern Blot Analysis concluding with supporting results. A
light regulation experiment using RNA obtained from incubated
kelp blades which were analyzed on a Northern Blot using the
radioactive gene specific probes was conducted but its results
were ambiguous.
INTRODUCTION
Macrocystis pyrifera contains about eight distinct genes
which code for the FCP protein, similar to the CAB protein of
higher plants and green algae for both are part of the light
harvesting center connected to Photosystem II complex of photoÂ¬
synthesis (Grossman et al, 1990). FCP proteins function as a
satellite dish which focuses the suns light to reaction centers.
These eight different genes make up the FCP gene family of giant
kelp.
In this gene family, every gene is made up of a) about
an 858 homologus coding region of about 700 bp and b) a distinct
noncoding region of different sizes and of different sequences.
