temperature: 15Â°C; light: 70 micro E/m's which is approximately
half the saturating illumination (Gerard et al, 1986).
RESULTS
The primers indeed were gene specific. Each primer was
challenged by introducing various templates of different sizes
to the PCR reaction and then analyzing it on a gel. Only one
product of the correct size was obtained (see fig. 1).
After a 24 hr. exposure, the Southern revealed promising
results. In the blot labeled with the coding region the molecular
weight marker was easily distinguished while many bands in each
digest lane were visible. On the blot labeled with the 2A
noncoding region, again, the molecular weight marker could easily
be spotted. Using the marker as a reference point, one band
in each digest lane could be distinguished, each of which
corresponded to one band on the blot labeled with the coding
region. These results highly suggest that the probes were gene
specific because only one band per lane was seen on the blot
labeled with the noncoding region.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, results from the
Northern Blot Analysis were ambiguous; clear results could not
be obtained.
