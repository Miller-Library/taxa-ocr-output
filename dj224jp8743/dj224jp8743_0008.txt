Behavioral response
light in S. heathiana
These responses were shown to be independent of the wavelength
of the light used to light adapt the animal, which
indicates that the differences did not result from
stimulating two separate visual pigments. Thus, while
this effect has clear adaptive significance, its
physiological mechanism has not been determined.
