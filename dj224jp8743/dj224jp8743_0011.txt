A Behavioral Response to Light in S. heathiana
Figure 4:
Magnitude of the on- and off-responses during various
stimulus regimes. Animals were light adapted for 20 minutes
prior to the start of the experiment using the monochromator, which
was used throughout to give test flashes. During Part I, the
light was interrupted intermittently for about 20 seconds to give
off-on" stimuli. For Fart II, the light was turned off and the
responses of the animal were followed during dark adaptation using
using short flashes of "on-off" stimuli. In Part III, a return
to the first stimulus regime was used to follow the responses during
light adaptation. Note that the rate of change of the off-response
is greater than that of the on-response during dark adaptation.
while during light adaptation the reverse is true.Lower trace same as Fig. 1.
Figure 5:
Nagnitude of the on- and off-responses under three different
colored conditioning lights:. A. White light; B. Blue light (Corning
5-58 filter); C. Red light (Wratten 22 filter). Dashed lines indic-
ate onset and removal of the adaptation light.
