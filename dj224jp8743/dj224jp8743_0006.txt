Behavioral response to light in S. heathiana
ranges of wavelengths of the adaptation light on the
magnitude of the off-response was examined in
Stenoplax as well; however, no significant wavelength
dependence could be discerned (Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
While Stenoplax is predominately a nocturnal animal
which seeks the undersides of rocks during the day, it
can be found exposed early in the morning (Heath, 1899).
In addition, presumably the moon can sometimes provide
sufficient light for some predators to see Stenoplax when
it is out grazing. Consequently Stanoplax's ability to
detect and to react to a sudden change in light
intensity may reflect its ability to detect and react
to changes in lighting produced by an approaching
predator. Since chitons are unable to outrun many
potential predators, a clamp-down to impede removal from
the substrate is probably their best defense.
From a behavioral viewpoint, at least, Stenoplax
seems to rely on its "on-receptors" during periods of
low illumination and on its "off-receptors"during periods
of high illumination for its primary source of information
about sudden changes in intensity levels. This may give
the animal a wider range of ambient illumination in which
a potential predator can be detected.
