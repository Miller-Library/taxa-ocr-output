A Behavioral Response to Light in S. heathiana
Figure Captions.
Figure 1:
A. Response of Stenoplax to test flashes of light during dark
adaptation (A of the test flash - 500 nm). B. Response to the
same test flash just subsequent to approximately 30 minutes of
light adaptation. (Vertical axis indicates response magnitude in
upper traces. The lower traces indicate the duration of test flashes:
upward deflection indicates the onset of the stimulus and down-
ward deflection indicates the cessation of the stimulus.
Stimulus duration is about 20 seconds.)
Figure 2:
Average of five runs showing magnitudes of the on-response
and off-response during light and dark adaptation. Animals were
dark adapted for one hour prior to the start of the experiment.
The striped bar shows the period of light adaptation (about
30 minutes). Response magnitude, in this and in all figures, is
by the polygraph
in arbitrary units which are in proportion to uncalibrated values recorded
Figure 3:
Magnitude of the off-response after 30 minutes light adapta-
tion under different intensity conditioning lights. Different
intensities were achieved using neutral density filters. The
adaptation light
was removed at time = 0.
