Behavioral response to light in S. heathiana
adaption, and a photoreceptor mechanism for this phenomenon
has been proposed (Mpitsos, 1973). The present investi¬
gation, on the chiton Stenoplax heathiana (Berry , 1946),
obtained the first measurements of an increase in a
behavioral response to shadowing during light adaption.
MATERIALS AND GENERAL METHODS
Specimens of Stenoplax heathiana were collected
intertidally off Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California,
in May, 1974, and were used in experiments not more than
three weeks after collection. The animals were maintained
unfed in tanks of running seawater at a temperature of
about 14°c.
The response to shadowing in this animal consists
primarily of a movement of the dorsal surface towards
the substrate, hereafter termed a "clamp-down". In
order to measure this clamp-down response, the dorsal
surfaces of the animals were first carefully dried, and
a pin, fashioned into a hook, was glued to their plates
at about the middle of the body. After allowing the
animals to adjust to this condition for at least 24 hours,
a specimen was selected and placed in a wax-bottomed pan
filled with sea-water kept at about 14°C by a Peltier cell.
A string from a force transducer was hooked around the pin
