Behavior response to light in S. heathiana
Then test flashes, each 20 seconds in duration and
given at least six minutes apart, were presented from the
monochromator. The test flashes used within any one
sequence were identical in intensity, and had a wavelength
of 500 nm. After dark adaptation, the on-response was
of much greater magnitude than the off-response (Figure
2). The animals were then light-adapted for about 30
minutes. The monochromatic test flashes were again
used to test the magnitude of the responses. During
and immediately after the light adaptation, the onÂ¬
response was considerably weakened, while the off-response
usually increased during presentation of the adaptation
light, and was always stronger just subsequent to its
removal (Figure 2).
The magnitude of the effect of light adaptation was
found to be dependent upon the intensity of the adaptation
light: the stronger the light used to adapt the animal
prior to testing, the more the off-response was increased
(Figure 3). It does not appear to matter whether the
on-stimulus is given before the off-stimulus or vice-versa,
and furthermore, the rates of change of the two responses
are not necessarily correlated (Figure 4). In Lima scabra
the eame effect has been noted and shown to be highly
dependent on the wavelength of the adaptation light
(Mpitsos, 1973). The effect of using three different
