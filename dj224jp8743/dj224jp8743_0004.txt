Behavioral response to light in S. heathiana
the flash ("on-response") and to its removal ("off-response").
The behavior as measured was the same for each stimulus;
a rapid lowering of the dorsal surface began 1 to 3 seconds
after the onset of the stimulus, and continued for about
five seconds. The chiton then returned to its original
position, a process which was highly variable in duration
and lasted up to several minutes (see Figure 1). The
actual displacement of the animal's plates during this
process was only about one mm; the tension of the string
from the strain gauge may have decreased the normal
displacement slightly.
The clamp-down response could be evoked by other
stimuli as well. Stroking the dorsal surface of the
animals with a pin, disturbing the water in the tray, or
any sharp movement which might affect the tray, such as
a tap on the table-top close to the animal, resulted in
a clamp-down. Some animals clamped down in the absence
of stimuli perceivable by the investigator. The clampÂ¬
down responses elicited by all types of stimuli were
indistinguishable from one another. Only clamp-downs that
occurred from 1 to 3 seconds after the presentation of a
light stimulus were counted as responses to light.
In order to determine the relative effects of light
and dark adaptation on the on- and off-responses, specimens
were first allowed to dark adapt for at least one hour.
