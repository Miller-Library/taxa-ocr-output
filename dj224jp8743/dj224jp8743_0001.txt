Behavioral response to light in S. heathiana
INTRODUCTION
Many species of chitons have aesthetes, unique
photoreceptors whose structure has been examined (e.g.
Omelich, 1967), but whose role in behavior has received
little attention. The most common light-mediated
behaviors noted among chitons are: 1) phototaxis
(usually found to be negative); 2) diurnal activity
patterns; and 3) shadow responses (Heath, 1899; and Boyle,
1972). The first two behaviors require only photoreceptors
that are able to detect the presence of light and of light
intensity gradients. The shadow response, on the other
hand, requires the ability to detect sudden decrements in
light intensity. Since the approach of possible predators
could very well be signalled by a shadow, the ability to
detect a sudden drop in light intesity may be of selective
value. Obviously, a shadow response can only occur
when animals are illuminated, on the other hand, since
the sensitivity of most photoreceptors is attenuated by
long exposures to light, due to bleaching of the visual
pigment, it might be expected, that the shadow response
of chitons would weaken during the day. However, in
another mollusk, Lima seabra (Born), the strength of
the sensory response to shadowing increases during light
