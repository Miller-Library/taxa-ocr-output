Physiologically, the weakening of the clamp-down in
response to the on-stimulus during light adaptation
can be accounted for by bleaching of the visual pigment.

this effect led to a proposed mechanism involving two
visual pigments. The present study has turned up no
such wavelength dependence in Stenoplax, suggesting that
this mechanism is probably not functioning here. However,
it can not be conclusively ruled out, solely on the
basis of this study. In order to more fully investigate
this problem, a neurophysiological approach would be
ideal; unfortunately preliminary attempts to record
from the lateral nerve cord, which is known to innervate,
the aesthetes, were unsuccessful.
SUMMARY
The chiton Stenoplax heathinan was shown to respond
to both the onset (on-response/ and the removal (off-response)
of a light stimulus. In both cases the response consisted
of a slight clamp-down to the substrate, presumably to
help maintain the animals grip on the substrate. If
the animal is light adapted, the magnitude of the offÂ¬
response increases while that of the on-response decreases.
