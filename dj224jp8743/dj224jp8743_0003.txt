giving a permanent record of relative changes in string
tension. In order to eliminate all lateral movement.
a tight enclosure was built around the animals using
pins inserted in the wax. With this enclosure in place,
string tensions could be changed only by vertical movement
of the chiton's plates.
Two light sources were used during the course of the
experiment. Monochromatic test flashes were supplied by
a high intensity diffraction grating using a 100-watt
tungsten-halide lamp; the intensity of this source was
controlled by alinear neutral density wedge; a camera
shutter was used to control the duration of the test
flashes. Background adaptation lights were provided by
a heat-filtered 18-watt tungsten lamp equipped with a
Corning 5-58 filter, with a transmission maximum at about
450 nm, and a Wratten 22 filter which cut off wavelengths
of light below 560 nm.
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
When presented with a 20 second test stimulus from
the monochromatic source (A = 500 nm), Stenoplax displayed
a behavioral clamping down to both the presentation of
