algae, or bryozoans were left in the bowl,the water was fouled
within a few days.
Cryptic coloration was obvious in various species of
caprellids. All juveniles observed were transparent, making
them difficult to see. On adults of C. incisa found on
T. occidentalis, short bars of deep red against a light
background made this species inconspicuous on its substrate,
This caprellid was not found further than 1.5 cm from T.
occidentalis. C. penantis adults had a mottled orange brown col-
oration matching well the background presented by Aglaophenia
C. californica adults possessed red bars running across their
bodies and gnathopods. Adults of C. brevirostris were
transparent except for their eyes, as well as their guts, which
tended to assume the color of food material within.
Discussion
The need for resource partitioning among co-occuring
species of caprellids was addressed by Caine (1977). He
found that co-occuring, filter-feeding caprellids tend to
utilize particles of different sizes, collected at different
heights above the substratum. He noted that niche diversity
in caprellids may involve morphological, behavioral, or
physiological features of the species. Few differences in
feeding behavior and morphology of feeding appendages were
found between the species present on A. struthionides.
Due to the great abundance of C. penantis relative to other
species, resource partitioning may not occur. Competition may
well be limited and other species (such as C. incisa) may
have other preferred substrates. In addition, it may be that
experimental designcombined with the opportunistic nature of
