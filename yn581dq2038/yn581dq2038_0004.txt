Gragborn
system was designed to simulate in some degree the effects
of local turbulance and water flow in the natural habitat.
Substrates with resident caprellids were pinned to the inlet
rubber stopper. Feeding behaviors were observed with a stereo-
microscope. Two ten minute feeding observations were made of
the same individual caprellid on the same Aglaophenia plume
at twelve hour intervals. After two 10 minute observations
were completed, milk was injected to study turbulance and
particle settling in the region occupied by the caprellid.
Caprellids were seen to move in response to contact with the
milk. No further behavioral observations were made until all
visible traces of milk in the tube had disappeared. All in-
dividuals were examined 12 hours after the last experiment in
which they were used, and results are presented only for animals
still alive at that time.
Distribution information was obtained in the lab within
2 hours of collecting A. struthionides in the field. Hydroid
colonies were collected submerged in separate glass jars,
and placed in glass bowls filled with seawater. With a bowl
under the dissecting scope, the number of adult and juvenile
caprellids on the proximal and distal half of each frond were
recorded under minimal illumination. Species identification
of juveniles was not feasible. After caprellid size, species,
and distribution was recorded, the frond under consideration was
removed from the colony with forceps and measured. Once removed,
fronds and accompanying caprellids were not returned to the bowl.
Line drawings of feeding appendages of the four caprellid
species encountered were made with the aid of a camera lucida
