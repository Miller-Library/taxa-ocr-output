thus offering a possible reason why scavenging wasn't noted.
Of the remaining three types of feeding, filter-feeding was
frequently seen; no distinction was made between browsing and
scraping, and these are considered together.
Caprellids were observed to situate and orient themselves
such that they were out of the main current and exposed to
flow rates generally less than 1 cm per second. The adults
of all 4 species investigated often stood virtually motionless,
taking advantage of eddy currents created by the substrates.
Positioning was such that particulate matter present in the
water column drifted past or fell slowly on the caprellid.
Browsing and scraping seem to be related to the side of
the frond where a caprellid is found. Observation of both
sides of Aglaophenia fronds showed a much greater frequency of
encrusting organisms on the abaxial side. In the flow tube,
C. californica was found on the abaxial side of the Aglaophenia
frond 78% of the times observed, while C. penantis and
C. brevirostris were found in this orientation 70% and 65%
of the time respectively.
Filter-feeding and related behaviors, as well as scraping,
were subdivided into eight classes of stereotyped behavior,
defined below. A summary of feeding behaviors of four species of
caprellids is presented in figure 2.
Behavior 1 represents the bending of the first antenna
over the cephalon. Gnathopod 1 on the same side of the body
is then closed around the base of Al, which is drawn through
Gi, presumably removing trapped particles (figs. 3 & 4).
Behavior 2 is similar to behavior 1, except that antenna
2 is being cleaned instead of antenna 1 (figs. 3 & 4).
