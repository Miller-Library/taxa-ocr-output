Distribution
Distribution of adult and juvenile caprellids on
Aglaophenia half fronds is presented in figure i. More
juveniles than adults were present on Aglaophenia fronds of
all size classes. Species of juveniles was not determined.
The distinction between adults and juveniles was based on
size and to some extent, color. Transparent individuals
smaller than 2.2 mm were classified as juveniles. Transparent
individuals larger than 2.2 mm and caprellids with coloration
in regions other than the gut (generally larger than 2.0 mm)
were considered as adults. Distribution of adult species is
summarized in table 1.
Only one species (C. penantis) is common on A. struthionides,
It therefore seems likely that most juveniles are C. penantis.
Other species occur only sporadically, and their main dis-
tribution may be elsewhere. The skewed distribution of species
suggests that resource partitioning may not be important in
this microhabitat.
Feeding Behavior
Five types of feeding mechanisms have been described in
adult caprellids, including browsing, filter feeding, predation,
scavenging, and scraping (Caine, 1977). In the present study,
predation and scavenging were not observed. The lack of
predation may be due to rem val of prey items by filter
feeders present in the laboratory seawater pipes. The current
maintained in the observation chamber may have washed away
organisms which weren't actively clinging to the substrate,
