Introduction
Mayer (1882) and subsequent workers have noted that the
vast majority of caprellids are found on living substrates.
Numerous species occur on hydroids, and a variety of relaÂ¬
tionships between the caprellid and its hydroid host have
been reported. Lockington (1875), Mayer (1882), and Mackay
(1945) stated that caprellids eat or parasitize hydroids.
Green (1963) concluded that hydroids were utilized solely
as a substratum, while McDougal (1943), reported that the
major food source of caprellids were sessile protozoans
and diatoms growing on the hydroids. Food acquisition by
filter feeding was noted by Saunders (1965), Patton (1968).
and Keith (1969). Keith concluded that caprellids were
opportunists, utilizing the most readily available organic
material as food. This appears to consist mainly of floating
organic detritus in their natural habitat. Caine (1974)
examined the possible relationship between food sources and
appendage structure in various sympatric caprellid species,
In a subsequent paper (Caine,1977), he reported that most
co-occuring, filter-feeding caprellids don't utilize the
same size of particle at the same height above the substratum.
At Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, 3 species
of Caprella (C. penantis, C. brevirostris, C. californica)
occuring on the hydroid Aglaophenia struthionides (Murray)
and one species (C. incisa) associated with the bryozoan
Tricellaria occidentalis (Trask) were examined. Since four
species of caprellids have been found in the same small
area, three of these in the same microhabitat,it seems
likely that resource partitioning of some type occurs,
