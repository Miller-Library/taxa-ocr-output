particularly with respect to food. This possibility
was investigated in the present study.
Materials and Methods
Four species of Caprella were collected from intertidal
waters surrounding the northeast shore of Mussel Point,
California. C. californica, C. penantis, C. brevirostris,
and C. incisa were collected by gathering colonies of
Aglaophenia struthionides and nearby substrates. Prionitis
was the substrate for A. struthionides in all cases and
Tricellaria occidentalis was found growing at the base of
A. struthionides in approximately one fifth of the collections.
Specimens were gathered within one hour of low tide and
transferred to the lab in jars filled with sea water. Only
specimens submerged at low tide were collected. Upon return
to the lab, caprellids and their substrates were placed in
bowls filled with seawater and most of the Prionitis (hydroid
substrate) was removed. Fresh seawater at a temperature of
10-15 degrees C was allowed to flow into the bowls. The
T. occidentalis was identified by C. Baxter of Hopkins Marine
Station.
Feeding behaviors were observed for each species with
the aid of an event recorder coupled to a strip chart recorder,
permitting the recording of 8 different categories of stereo-
typed behaviors. A chamber for the observation of caprellids
on Aglaophenia consisted of a 15 cm length of glass tubing
2.2 cm in inside diameter, fitted at both ends with single
hole rubber stoppers and provided with a constant supply of
fresh seawater flowing at the rate of 132 ml per minute. Linear
flow past caprellids was approximately i cm per second. This
