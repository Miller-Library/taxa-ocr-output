Behavior 3 represents simultaneous bending of antennae
1 and 2 over the cephalon. Gnathopod 1 on the same side of
the body is then closed around the bases of Al and A2, which
are drawn through Gl, removing trapped particles (figs. 3 & 4).
Behavior 4 signifies bodily cleaning from the gills to
the distal pereopod. Gnathopod 1 picks and/or scrapes
material from the body (figs. 3 & 4).
Behavior 5 represents the removal of material from G2
by Gl (figs. 3 & 4).
Behavior 6. This involves pulling or scraping material
from the substrate by Gl (figs 3 & 4).
Behavior 7 represents active gathering of food. It
includes removal of detritus directly from the water column
with both first gnathopods, where it is then held in place.
Larger detritus may be similarly captured by all four gnathÂ¬
opods and held in place (figs. 3 & 4). In C. incisa, waving
of both first gnathopods through the water, presumably
filtering food from the water, has been observed. This feeding
mechanism is also included in tabulated results.
Behavior 8 considers movement of Gl to the caprellid's
mouth, where the maxillipeds contact it (figs. 3 & 4).
Statistical analysis using the Student-Newman-Keuls
test indicated significant differences (p=0.05) between
C. incisa and C. californica in frequency of behaviors 4
(cleaning of body with Gl from gills to distal pereopod)
and 7 (active gathering of food, including catching of large
detritus with Gl and G2, and combing of water with G1);
between C. incisa and C. brevirostris in behaviors 4 and 5
(cleaning of G2 with G1), and in behavior 5 for C. incisa
