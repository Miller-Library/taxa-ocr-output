Abstract
Caprella californica, C. brevirostris, and C. penantis
may occur together on the hydroid Aglaophenia struthionides.
Caprella incisa may occur on the bryozoan Tricellaria
occidentalis growing in close proximity. Cleaning and feeding
behavior of these caprellid species were compared under
conditions simulating natural water flow. All species were
seen to engage in filter feeding and some in scraping and
macrophagous feeding. Quantitative comparison of the main
components of feeding behavior in the three species on
Aglaophenia shows little obvious evidence of resource
partitioning, and the role of motility and positioning are con-
sidered.
