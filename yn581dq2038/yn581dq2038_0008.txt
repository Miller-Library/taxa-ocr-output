and C. penantis.
Some of the behaviors found in all four species occured
in typical coordinated sequences. Cleaning of antennae, G2,
and the body with Gl, and scraping were often followed by cleanÂ¬
ing of Gl with the maxillipeds. Walking was carried out in
the inchworm fashion typical of the caprellid. Variance for
data related to walking was high, so this information is
presented in two ways. First, data were pooled and the average
number of walks per individual per 10 minute trial was determined
for each of the four species examined (table 2). Next, the
number of 10 minute trials in which walking occured and the
number of trials in which it was absent are compared for
four caprellid species (table 3). The four species of caprellids
taken as a group were found to differ significantly (p=0.05)
in regard to the number of trials in which walking was or
was not present.
Miscellaneous natural history
Caprellids can be kept alive for periods of 2 weeks
and perhaps indefinitely at room temperature in glass bowls
using 1 mm mesh nylon screen as the sole substrate. If held
down with glass rods, caprellids could easily walk on it, or
cling to one location. Nauplius larvae from the goose barnacle
Pollicipes polymerus were used as a food source and provided
every 3-4 days. Larvae were stained with toluidine blue and
the guts of caprellids began to assume this color soon after
larvae were introduced. A stirring bar with a plastic blade
at the tip, suspended from a motor above the bowl, was used
to prevent the nauplii from sinking to the bottom where they
were unavailable to the caprellids. In cases where hydroids,
