feeding has obscured certain secondary feeding behaviors.
The caprellids investigated differ in the amount of
walking done, and in the positions and locations they assumed
(tables 2 & 3 ). Characteristically in Aglaophenia a group
of fronds radiate from a compact holdfast at the base, such
that different fronds receive different amounts of exposure,
some being shielded by surrounding fronds. Shielding may
influence the location a caprellid uses for feeding. This
is evidenced by caprellid positioning in slow currents to
take advantage of particle settling. Positioning on the
axial or abaxial side of a frond seems to be related to the
availability of encrusting organisms which can be utilized
as food, since caprellids have been observed more frequently
on the abaxial side. Caprellids found on Aglaophenia were
sometimes observed to scrape a certain region and then move.
Walking may be a response to depleted local supplies of
encrusting organisms available as food. In addition, a wa king
caprellid may be "seeking" a site suitable for filter-feeding
in terms of currents and food.
