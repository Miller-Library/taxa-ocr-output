Horng & Hayhurst: Haul-Out Effects of the Pacific Harbor Seal on the Rocky Midtidal Community
Boal (1980), can be attributed to the species' non-independent relationship with an increase in
algae cover.
The results of our study indicate that Pacific harbor seals may have some impact on the
rocky midtidal community. The lack of significant differences in percent cover, diversity, algae
biomass, and algae frond length among seal haul-out intensities indicates that this impact is not
severe. However, because the limited sample size only allowed detection of the largest differences
between sites, this study cannot conclude that seal haul-out has no impact.
Further data are necessary in order to accurately assess the impact of the Pacific harbor seal
on the rocky midtidal community. In past years, the population of harbor seals has dramatically
increased at Hopkins Marine Refuge and in the surrounding area. If this trend continues, the
possible effects of seal haul-out will become an increasingly relevant topic. Future studies that
examine the effect of seal haul-out in the rocky intertidal should employ an experimental design
which accounts for the high degree of variance at all spatial scales in this environment. Spatial
heterogeneity needs to be considered when examining the effect of any factor on a community as
diverse as the rocky midtidal.
