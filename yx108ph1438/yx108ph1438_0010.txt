Horng & Hayhurst: Haul-Out Effects of the Pacific Harbor Seal on the Rocky Midtidal Community
Acknowledgments
Sinc√®re thanks to our advisor, Jim Watanabe, for his guidance and unending support from
start to finish. Without his help, this project would still be a question, and nothing more. Many
thanks to Terry Nicholson for her expert advice on anything related to seals. Finally, an apology
to the seals for intruding onto their home.
