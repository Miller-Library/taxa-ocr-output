Horng & Hayhurst: Haul-Out Effects of the Pacific Harbor Seal on the Rocky Midtidal Community
Abstract
This study, conducted at the Hopkins Marine Refuge in Pacific Grove, CA, examined haulÂ¬
out effects of the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) on the rocky intertidal community.
The study employed a nested sampling design, consisting of three replicate plots each within three
haul-out intensity sites, low, medium and high. Plots were sampled using 20 X 20 cm quadrats
haphazardly placed within a vertical range of 1.5 to 3 feet above MLLW.
Percent cover analysis of sessile species revealed no significant differences among haul-out
intensities. Mastocarpus papillatus cover, however, noticeably decreased as haul-out intensity
increased. Conversely, Mazzaella affinis cover increased as haul-out intensity increased. Average
algal biomass and frond length measurements also failed to demonstrate significant differences
among haul-out intensities. However, trends of increasing biomass and decreasing frond length
with increasing haul-out intensity were observed.
Due to the high level of heterogeneity in the rocky midtidal, only large differences among
haul-out sites could be detected by our experimental design. A lack of significant differences
among haul-out sites does not rule out the possibility of actual impact by harbor seals. Observed
trends indicate that haul-out of harbor seals may have a moderate impact on the rocky midtidal
community.
