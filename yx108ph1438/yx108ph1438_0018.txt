Horng & Hayhurst: Haul-Out Effects of the Pacific Harbor Seal on the Rocky Midtidal Community
8. Average percent cover was graphed for the six most abundant species of algae encountered.
Error bars for each column graph standard error. Intensity refers to seal haul-out intensity. No
clear trends in general algae cover can be seen among seal haul-out intensities.
9. Average percent cover of Mastocarpus papillatus and Mazzaella affinis was graphed for each
plot. Error bars represent the standard error of that plot. Low, medium, and high refers to seal
haul-out intensities. The graph indicates trends of decreasing M. papillatus cover and increasing
M. affinis cover with greater seal haul-out intensities.
10. Average dry algae biomass (grams / meter2) was graphed for each plot. The triangle symbols
indicate the mean of the three plots of that intensity. Intensity refers to seal haul-out intensity. A
general trend of increasing algae biomass with increasing seal haul-out intensity is indicated by the
graph.
11. Average extended algal frond length (millimeters) was graphed for each plot. The triangle
symbols indicate the mean of the three plots for that intensity. Error bars indicate the standard
error of that plot. Intensity refers to seal haul-out intensity. A possible trend of decreasing algae
frond length with increasing seal haul-out intensity is indicated by the graph.
12. The Shannon index of diversity (H') was graphed for each plot. Symbols represent the average
diversity of those three plots. Average diversity is used to estimate the diversity for that intensity.
Intensity refers to seal haul-out intensity. The graph indicates similar diversities for each seal haulÂ¬
out intensity.
