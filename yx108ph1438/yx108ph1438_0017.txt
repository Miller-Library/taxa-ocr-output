Horng & Hayhurst: Haul-Out Effects of the Pacific Harbor Seal on the Rocky Midtidal Community
Figure Legend
1. Shaded areas represent the worldwide distribution of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) (Riedman,
1990).
2. Topographical map of Hopkins Marine Refuge. Arrows indicate locations of the sampled plots.
3. Graph of the average number of seals at any given time during the day for each plot. Intensity
refers to seal haul-out intensity. Large differences among intensities support the categorization of
plots as low, medium, and high in seal haul-out use.
4. Close-up topographical map of Hopkins Marine Refuge, Hewatt's Dome and vicinity,
Numbers and arrows indicate the location of each plot. 12 and 13 are high intensity plots and 14 is
Ã  medium intensity plot. Plot 14 extends to figure 5.
5. Close-up topographical map of Hopkins Marine Refuge, Bird Rock and vicinity. Numbers and
arrows indicate the location of each plot. 6 and 7 are low intensity plots and 9 is a medium
intensity plot. Parts of plot 14, a medium intensity plot, extends over from figure 4. Plot 7
includes both sides of Pete's Rock.
6. Close-up topographical map of Hopkins Marine Refuge, Seal Island and vicinity. Numbers and
arrows indicate the location of each plot. 5 is a low intensity plot, 4 a medium intensity plot, and 5
a high intensity plot.
7. Plot of the cumulative number of species encountered as the number of points in the quadrat
increased. The vertical line marks the number of points sampled for each quadrat in this study
(35).
