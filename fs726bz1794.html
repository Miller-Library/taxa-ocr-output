INTRODUCTION
The study of animals in the field often reveals aspects of behavior
not discoverable from observations on captive animals. Behavioral
studies on intertidal organisms in the field are usually carried out
during periods of low tide. Observations at high tide are more difficult
to make, particularly at night, and animal behavior under these conditions
remains largly unexplored. A search of the literature revealed no
such work done on chitons.
This study, carried out on Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846), was
directed toward revealing its temporal and spatial patterns of activity.
Attention was also focused on inter- and intraspecific interactions
involved in habitat partitioning, and on the possible occurrence of
individual homesites and territories or home ranges. Homing ability
in some <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polyplacophora : Exact'>Polyplacophora</span> has been noted previously (Crozier 1921; Thorne,
1967, 1968).
FIELD STUDY SITE AND METHODS
The present study was carried out during the Spring of 1974 on the
rocky shores of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. Mopalia muscosa
is common here, particularly in the mid tide zone. The site selected
was a surface 1.2 x 1.3 m on a sculptured granitic outcropping, occurring
between the +1.8 and +4.2 foot tide level on the eastern edge of the
point.Surf conditions at the site during high tide varied from a gentle
surge to breaking waves.
The macroalgae occurring in the study site were <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina papillata : Exact'>Gigartina papillata</span>

study site, whereas the numbers of C. digitalis and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. scabra</span> declined in
the neighboring areas.
The activity of eight individuals of Mopalia muscosa in the study
site was monitored over a five-week period from April 28 to May 30, 1974.
Marking the chitons was unnecessary due to distinctive individual
differences in algal growth on their plates. The substrate was also
S. Y. Smith
Activity Patterns of Mopalia muscosa
page 4
unmarked, and natural landmarks were used as reference points to note the
Positions of animals. The chitons could, in this way, be observed with
minimal disturbance.
An initial 48-hour watch indicated that the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mopalia : Exact'>Mopalia</span> moved only at
night, therefore an intensive surveillance of the chitons was conducted
from just before dusk to shortly after dawn, with intermittent daytime
observations. The night time observations were made at intervals of
15 minutes to one hour. For each observation the chitons' new positions
and the distances traveled from their previously noted positions were
recorded. These night observations were made with a flashlight, using a
red filter to reduce disturbance during their dark cycle. Observations
on submerged animals were made with the use of a wet suit, face plate,
and snorkle.
DIURNAL AND TIDAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS
The data on movements are summarized in Fig. 1; original data are
on file in the library at Hopkins Marine Station.
During daylight hours and when exposed by the tide, Mopalia muscosa
were not active, and were in fairly protected locations. Six of the
eight sites were adjacent to a sandy bottom and in a depression, crevice,
or at the base of a rock. Individuals were often partially or completely
buried by the sand. Another daytime site was under or next to Anthopleura
elegantissima and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anthopleura xanthogrammica : Exact'>Anthopleura xanthogrammica.</span> After foraging, the eight
individuals in the rocky area homed for 69 out of the 71 excursions monitored.
Homing is degined here as the return to the exact site the individual left
aarlier that night. In one instance, a rock washed into the home of a foraging
S. Y. Smith Activity Patterns of Mopalia muscosa
page 5
chiton and blocked it. This individual settled about 7 cm away, and then
consistently homed to this new site for 5 observed journeys over the
following 15 days. The only other occasion a chiton failed to home occurred
when one individual traveled 20 cm beyond it customary range of 40 cm
from home. Instead of returning, it stayed at a site similar to its old
home, about 35 cm away, and subsequently was lost from the study area.
Foraging occurred only at night, when the chitons were submerged or
awash. Not all of the animals monitored moved every night: during the
14 nights of observation the total number of times a particular individual
left home varied from 4 to 14, with a mean of 9.
If the rock was submerged or awash by an incoming tide at the onset
of dusk, the animals moved away from their homes. If the study site was
dry, activity was delayed until the chitons were wetted by the incoming
tide. The chitons began the return journey to their homesites at such
a time that they were back at their homesites before sunrise or before
a receeding tide uncovered them, whichever came first. Thus no animal in
the study site was left either conspicuously exposed to avian predators
or stranded in a position where desiccation rates were high.
Similar activity patterns were found for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chiton tuberculatus : Exact'>Chiton tuberculatus</span> Linne
by Crozier (1921) and for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acanthozostera gemmata : Exact'>Acanthozostera gemmata</span> (Blainville) by Thorne
(1967, 1968).
Figure 1 illustrates other intriguing variations in activity. More
individuals were active at spring tides (May 7, May 20 and May 21, 1974)
than at neap tides (April 29 and May 9, 1974). There was a period of
inactivity during high tide at night when the individuals were away from
home (May 3, May 7 and May 20, 1974). In addition, some individuals
remained out, but inactive, during the high low tides that occurred in
the middle of the night. (April 29 and May 9, 1974); these individuals were

located at the lowest vertical positions in the study area and during these
low tides were never entirely uncovered. On one occasion an individual
was found away from its home during a low tide that left it totally
uncovered. That particular animal halted movement until the next inÂ¬
coming tide, whoih occurred while it was still dark.
These observations suggest that the chitons predict the time and
perhaps the height of low tides. Westersund (1974) found evidence of
endogenous tidal rhythms in his work with Mopalia muscosa, which could
explain the animals' ability to anticipate coming events. He also found
the extent of their activity reflected the magnitude of the tides. This
is corroborated by my field observations.
HOME RANGES, DIET, AND INTERACTIONS WITH NEIGHBORS
Fifty-three chiton journeys were coninually monitored while an
ont
additional 18 journeys were monitored sporadically (due to adverse weather
conditions). Figures 2a and 2b show the various pathways the individuals
followed. The distances traveled from the homesites ranged from 5 to 50 cm,
most being between 25 and 40 cm. Only on one occasion, already described,
did an individual move farther than 50 cm from his home.
Each Mopalia muscosa appeared to have a series of established pathways
within a radius of 50 cm from their homesites. These pathways were
followed fairly closely and consistently, though they did not always appear
to coincide with any obvious contours of the substrate. The same path,
was normally used on both the outgoing journey and the return home, though
this was not always the case. In general, a chiton left home, traveled to
a certain location within its home range, and remained there "until it was
time" to return home. The locations to which foraging chitons traveled
S. Y. Smith
Activity Patterns of Mopalia muscosa
page 7
usually had much macroalgae present; yet some locations were void of any
macroalgae. On several occasions, feeding on Gigartina papillata was
observed.
Quantitative studies of the diet of Mopalia muscosa were not underÂ¬
taken, but the gut contents of 5 chitons from very similar habitats in
areas adjacent to the sutyd site were analyzed qualitatively. The guts
contained a wide variety of algal material along with small amounts of
animal matter and a lot of sand. Those algae that appeared most often were
identified (with the assistance of Dr. Isabella A. Abbott) as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina : Exact'>Gigartina</span> spp.,
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cladophora : Exact'>Cladophora</span> sp., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endocladia muricata : Exact'>Endocladia muricata</span> (Postels and Ruprecht) J. G. Agardh,
and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia occidentalis : Exact'>Hildenbrandia occidentalis</span> Setchell. Also included were Petrocelis
franciscana, (author), <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chaetomorpha : Exact'>Chaetomorpha</span> sp. and a variety of blue-green and
coralline algae. Boolootian (1964) also found M. muscosa to be a nonÂ¬
specific herbivore, feeding on what was available, along with small
amounts of animal matter he believed was accidentally ingested.
The home ranges of individual chitons, as determined by the paths
they followed, did not appear to overlap. Only on 2 out of the 63 chitons
journeys monitored did a chiton enter into another's home range. On one
of these occasions the resident individual left its home, approached the
intruder's girdle and remained there for about half an hour. The resident
chiton then left the intruder and traveled a wide semicircle of about a
50 cm radius in its home range before returning home again. The intruder
remained for a little over an hour before moving off to a new site.
Collisella pelta were absent from the study area but were abundant on
rocks in adjacent areas, indicating possible competitive exclusion. Connor
(1974) demonstrated that <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. pelta</span> exhibits an avoidance reaction to M. muscosa
pushing C. pelta when it encountered the limpet in its territory.

BEHAVIOR IN OTHER HABITATS
Limited observations were made on six M. muscosa located in a tide
pool adjacent to the main study site, and on two individuals located on
a cement substrate immediately above this pool. The six individuals in
the tide pool did not home or follow regular pathways, but rather
wandered throughout the pool. At dawn, they settled in sites out of
direct sunlight and there spent the day. Activity at low tide during the
night decreased in the pool but did not halt altogether as in the
chitons of the rocky habitat which were exposed to air during low tide.
The two chitons located on the cement substrate above the tide pool,
like the rocky habitat individuals, returned to specific homes after
foraging at night during the high tides. They, too, generally followed
specific pathways within limited home ranges. None of the eight chitons
was active during the day and all showed a tidal rhythm in some degree.
SUMMARY
1. The movements of eight Mopalia muscosa inhabiting the rocky intertidal
were followed during 14 days over a one month period (April 28-May30).
All were regularly covered and uncovered by the tides.
2. The animals moved about only at night when submerged or awash. They
were inactive during the day and when exposed by low tides at night.
3. Each animal occupied a spcific home site when inactive; home sites on
rocks near or in sand, or adjacent to sea anemones (Arthopleura spp.).
4. In foraging, individuals normally followed specific pathways leading no
more than 50 cm from the home site, and returned along the same path.
5. Diet consisted mainly of red algae; the animals appear to be relatively
unselective herbivores.

6. A competitive herbivore, Collisella pelta, appeared to be excluded from
the home range of M. muscosa.
7. Animals observed in a tidepool showed similar basic activity patterns
but failed to home or completly halt movement during low tides at
night, as seen in those directly exposed to the tidal cycle.

FIGURE CAPTIONS
Fig. 1: Date, time, light, tidal height, and movements of 8 M. muscosa
during ten 14 hr. periods of observation. Positions of animals
were recorded at intervals of 15 min. to 1 hr. throughout the
14 hours for these ten dates. Four additional nights these
chitons were observed only the observations were sporadic.
This additional data is included in an Appendex on file at Hopkins
Marine Station. Each vertical white bar above the axis indicates
the percentage of the total number of animals moving sometime
within that hour: the dark vertical bar shows the average
distance these animals moved during that hour. Below the line
the vertical white bar indicates the percentage of the total
number of animals away from their homes, which does not always
equal the percentage moving. Absence of bars means all animals
were examined and found to be immobile at their home sites.
