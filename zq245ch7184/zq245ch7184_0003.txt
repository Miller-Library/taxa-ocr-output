five snails were tested during the same period of time, so there is
no variation due to a diurnal cycle (if one exists). The tests were
run at a water temperature from 14 -16 C. Each time the oxygen level
l
was determined 40 milliliters of water was removed. Therefore, at the
m
end of the test period there was only 50 milliliters of water present.
(This remevalof water caused the snails to produce a muah more rapid

decrease in the concentration of oxygen per milliliterefwater than
M
they weuld have done if left in 250 milliliters of water.)
In determining the lactic acid level of T. funebralis inrelatien when

to approaching anaerobiosis individual snails were put in 100 milliliters
of water with a mineral oil layer on the surface of the water. The snails
were tested for periods varying from 18 to 160 hours, the oxygen
content of the water being determined at the beginning and end of each
test. The initial oxygen concentrations ranged from 5.3 to 5.6
M
microliters of oxygen per milliliter of water. The lactic acid present
in each snail at the end of the test period was determined using the
Barker and Summerson method (Barker, S.B., 1957, p. 241).
RESULTS and DISCUSSION
