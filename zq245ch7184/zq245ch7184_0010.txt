HOLZ, WALLY (Stanford U., Stanford) Relationship between oxygen
consumption and lactic acid concentration in Tegula funebralis
(A. Adams, 1854)
Oxygen consumptions were determined with the Winkler method. The
Barker and Summerson method was used for lactic acid determinations.
The consumption of oxygen by Tegula funebralis continues in water of
low oxygen content, but at a much reduced rate. Lactic acid does not
accumulate in excessive amounts until the animal has been under conditions
of low oxygen tension for periods in excess of 160 hours. It appears
that both sessation of physical activity and a continued low extraction
of oxygen from the environment tend to suppress the accumulation of lactic
acid when the animal is in waters of low oxygen content.
