SUMMARY
1. The relation between the rate of oxygen consumption by Tegula funebralis
(A. Adams, 1854) and the oxygen content of sea water has been
investigated.
2. The consumption of oxygen continues in water of low oxygen content,
but at a much reduced rate.
3. Lactic acid does not accumulate in excessive amounts until the
animal has been under conditions of low oxygen tension for
periods in excess of 160 hours.
4. Itappetht both gessation of physical activity and a continued
low extraction of oxygen from the environment tend to suppress the
accumulation of lactic acid when the animal is in waters of low
oxygen content.
