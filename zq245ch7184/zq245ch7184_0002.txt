This study was directed toward discovering the effect of
approaching anaerobiosis on the lactic acid level in Tegula funebralis
(A. Adams, 1854), and the nature of the relationship between the avail-
ability of oxygen and the amount of this product of metabolism.
In order to produce conditions approaching anaerobiosis snails were
placed in water not in contact with the atmosphere. The animals then
depleted the oxygen supply of the water to the level at which they
could withdraw either no oxygen at all or only small amounts,et
oxygen.
METHODS
Inerderte determine theeffect of approaching anaerobiosis upon
the level of lyygen eensumptien in the animals, Five snailwere taken
directly from the field before each experiment and placed in graduated
cylinders containing 250 milliliters of fresh sea water. The surface

of the water was covered with a layer of mineral oil to paexent oxygen

cages contained openings large enough to allow for the easy movement

the oxygen concentration throughout the water. The oxygen condentnetien
was measured at the beginning of each test and at two hour intervals
for eight hours; In determining the exygen level in the water the
Winkler method was used (Rogers, Charles G., 1929, p. 81). All
