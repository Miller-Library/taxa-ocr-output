of activity and low continuing uptake of oxygen even at this level

All the levels of lactic acid accumulated by the snails examined
up to 89 hours fell within the range of values obtained from analysis

tissues of snails removed from the field at low low tide and high high
tide. The amount of the material in the animals examined at low low
tide ranged from 120 to 380 micrograms per gram of dry weight of smail
and at high high tide from 300 to 590 micrograms per gram dry weight
of snail. While more animals should be examined, the results are
suggestive with respect to the possible tidal cycle observed by Suyder(ig63).
