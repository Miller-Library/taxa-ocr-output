It is of particular interest that Dr. Barnard found
mature specimens of Hyale grandicornis in Ulva, and that
the present study has revealed only juvenile individuals
in the mantle groove and nuchal caviti of Acmaea. Ulva
occurs mainly in the warmer months in the region studied,
and at the end of the present study it was just beginning
to grow. Perhaps the immature forms of Hyale grandicornis
migrate to the Ulva as they attain sexual maturity and as
the alga appears each summer, and possibly the juvenile
amphipods survive during the winter and spring under Acmaea
shells.
The author plans to continue research on the problem.
Summary
1. Immature specimens of Hyale grandicornis (Kr√∏yer, 1845)
are found in the nuchal cavity and pallial groove in five
species of Acmaea and in Lottia gigantea.
2. The percentage of limpets hosting immature H. grandicernis
increases with decreasing height in the intertidal region.
The amphipod shows no clear preference for particular lim-
pet host species.
4. No amphipods were found in any limpets less than 8 mm in
shell length. For limpets above this size there is a slight
positive correlation between shell length and the percent
of limpets bearing amphipods. However, for those limpets
which housed amphipods, there was no correlation between
