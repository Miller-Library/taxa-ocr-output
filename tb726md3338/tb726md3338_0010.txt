Acknowledgments
This work was made possible by grant GY806 from
the Undergraduate Research Participation Program of
the National Science Foundation. Dr. J. Laurens
Barnard of the Smithsonian Institution identified
the amphipods as Hyale grandicornis. The author is
very grateful for his help and suggestions. Appreciation
is also expressed for pertinent literature supplied
by Dr. Peter W. Glynn of the Institute of Marine Biology
University of Puerto Rico. Discussions with David A.
Egloff of Hopkins Marine Station proved helpful in
suggesting approaches to field and taxonomic problems.
Special thanks must go to Dr. Donald P. Abbott of
Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University for his
time and effort spent in discussing the project with
the author, and particularly for his criticism and
editorial comments on this paper. The Monterey
Foundation authorized the use of Pescadero Point for field
studies.
