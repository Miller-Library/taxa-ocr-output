JOHNSON, SAMUEL E. (Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, Calif., USA.) Occurence and Behavior of
Hyale grandicornis, a gammarid amphipod commensal in
the genus Acmaea. The Veliger
Immature individuals of the amphipod Hyale grandicornis
were found under the limpets Acmaea scabra, A. scutum,
A. digitalis, A. limatula, and A. pelta on intertidal rocks
1 - 6 feet above mean lower low water along the California
coast. H. grandocornis was not found in other situations
in the adjacent habitat. During the day the amphipods lie
deep in the mantle groove or nuchal cavity; at night they
move to the rim or upper surface of the shell and apparently
feed on algae growing on the shell. The percentage of
Acmaea hosting immature H. grandicornis increases with
decreasing height in the intertidal region. Hyale exhibits
no definite preference for particular species of Acmaea.--Author
