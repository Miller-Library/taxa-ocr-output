needed in collecting, for the amphipods often jump
away when the limpet is lifted from the substrate.
Each limpet collected was then identified, and its
shell length measured. The amphipods present with
each limpet were counted and sorted into three size
groups (0.5-2 mm, 2.-4 mm, and 4.-6 mm),
kinpertten.
Figure 6 shows the population density of each
species of Acmaea for each zone, and the percentage
of each Acmasa species which served as hosts to
H. grandicornis. In Zone A, no amphipode occur
even though suitable hosts are present. The Acma
species of Zone B, slightly lower in the intertidal
but overlapping Zone A, bear a small population of
amphipods. The large bouldere characterizing this
zone shade and protect it from deseidation, keeping
it moister than Zone A. From this point down to the
lowest populations of Acmaea examined, the population
of amphipods increases, with the exception of Zone D.
Zone Die characterized by the macroscopic algae
Endocladia, Sigartina, and Iridaea, while Zones C and
E are distinguished primarily by the encrusting algae
Hildenbrandis, Peyasonelia, Fetrocelis, and Ralfaia
Ulva was just beginning to grow in Zone E when field
studies were discontinued.
