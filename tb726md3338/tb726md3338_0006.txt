The present studies do not indicate any clear preference
on the part of the amphipods for any particular species of
Acmaea. Moreover, for those limpets which did house amphipods,
there appears to be no clear correlation between the shell length
of the limpet and the number of amphipods present (Figure 7). Howe
ever, for limpets with a shell length of 8 mm or more there does
appear to be a slight positive correlation between shell length
and the percent of the population bearing amphipods (Figure 8).
Limpets less than 8 mm long did not accomodate amphipods.
Natural History
Field examinations carried out at Pescadero Point and at
Mussel Point during day and night and at high and low periods
indicate that the amphipods do not leave the limpet at any time,
unless the latter is removed from the substratum. These obser-
vations are supported by the absence of free-living immature
H. grandicornis in areas adjacent to the limpet populations.
The position of the amphipods under the shell was deter-
mined from laboratory observations using aquaria in which
field conditions were approximated. During the day the
amphipods are found behind the head in the nuchal
