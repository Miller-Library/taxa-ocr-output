the shore side of large boulders. The sites chosen
were divided up into zones (Figures 3-5) based on both
plant and animal indices, and following natural grouping
forganisms on the rocks. Correlation of these zones
with those of Ricketts and Calvin (1939) and Doty (1946)
is shown in Figure 2. Intertidal elevations were
determined by measurement from a United States Geological
Survey bench mark on Pescadero Point and wore checked
against the theoretical tidal heighte as determined from
the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Tables
the Pacific Coast, using the time and height corrections
for Nonterey.
The population of the five species of Acmaea studied
determined by dividing the surface of the campling
sites into quadrats of 400 cm2, and recording numbers
of each Acmaen species present. The total area of each
zone studied in the sampling sites ranged from 2,5 to
3 m2. After determining the distribution and numbers of
Acmaed spp., the distribution and frequency of occurence
of H. grandicornis was determined by sampling of Acmaea
species in the individual zones. Attempts were made to
sollect representative numbers of the five species
studied from each zone but certain species in some areas
were extremely scarce or non-exist√§nt. Extreme care was
