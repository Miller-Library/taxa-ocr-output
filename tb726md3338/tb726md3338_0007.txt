cavity or deep in the groove between the mantle fold
and the foot. Sometimes an amphipod may be observed
at the edge of the mantle fold, but thie behavior i
rare in the daytime. In conditions of near darkness
and splash or submergence they are found lying on
their eides, in contact with the pallial tentaeles of
the limpet at the mantle margin. In this position the
amphipods groom themselves, and from it they also feed,
reaching around the edge of the shell or moving completel.
out onto its dorsal surface and seraping up the algae
growing there. Gut contente were unidentifiable, but
the material on the shell is composed of numerous
varities of diatoms and several types of blue-green
algae, primarily Enteromorpha. Occasionally small
growthe of Ulva are found on the shells. The amphipod
seem never to leave the limpet, but seek cover under
the sbell when disturbed. If an amphipod is trapped
outside and is unable to crawl under the host's shell
again, it either presses itself closely against the
edge of the shell and remains there, or moves away t
a nearby limpet. Other types of shelter, either in
field or laboratory, appear to be ignored. When
forced to awim, H. grandicornis moves very rapidly a
first, but quickly slows and appears to seek shelter.
If repeatedly disturbed, it soon ceases all movement.
