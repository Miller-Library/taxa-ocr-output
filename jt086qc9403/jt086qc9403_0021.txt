Acknowledgments
Without much patient and generous help, I could not have even begun
this study. Dr. Welton Lee constantly tempered my enthusiasm with
insight and sense, and edited the entire manuscript. Dr. Donald P. Abbott
offered invaluable assistance with methods and identification, and his
advice was always patiently and graciously given. Dave Anderson, Roy
Miller, Geoff Rabone, and Don Wiggin gathered all of the physical data
about the transects. Fred Johnson simultaneously studied the macrofauna
of the transects. Without their work, this study would have been much less
interesting. Jim Rote, Sam Johnson, and especially Paul Boothe gave me
much assistance with statistics. S. T. Wheeler typed the entire manuscript,
under difficult conditions. To all of them, I wish to express my gratitude
and respect.
