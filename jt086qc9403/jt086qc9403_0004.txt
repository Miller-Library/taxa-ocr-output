Introduction
Meiofauna, usually defined as organisms larger than protozoa but
less than one mm long in their adult stage, are the most numerous multi¬
celled organisms in the sandy beach ecosystem. Despite their abundance,
easy availability, and obvious ecological importance, they are little¬
studied (Pennak, 1950; Swedmark, 1964; Mclntyre, 1969; Hulings, 1971;
Hulings & Gray, 1971). Only a few researchers have undertaken field
surveys of sandy beach meiofauna. No studies have been made on the
open coast of the western Pacific, although Wieser (1959a, 1959b) has
studied the meiofauna of beaches along Puget Sound, Washington,
This study was undertaken to provide a further understanding of
sandy beach meiofauna of the western Pacific coast. It was also
designed to provide some insights into the sandy beach ecosystem in
general, and the role of physical influences in shaping that ecosystem,
