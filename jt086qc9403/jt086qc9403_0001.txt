Dear Dr. Barnes:
Enclosed is a manuscript entitled "The Interstitial Meiofaunal Associations
of Two Physically Different Areas of a Monterey Bay Sandy Beach," which
1 would like to submit for possible publication in the Journal of Experimental
Marine Biology and Ecology. I hope that you find everything in good order,
The large margin of variation reported "Statistical Accuracy" may at first
glance, seem to invalidate the study. However, the margin of variation
does not undermine any of the conclusions of the study. To my knowledge,
the method for checking extration inefficiencies has not been described
before. Furthermore, detailed statistical analyses have been regrettably
rare in meiofaunal population surveys,
I hope that you find the paper worthy of publication. If you should need
further information, I can be reached at the address below.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration,
Sincerely yours,
denn 8. Lelle
