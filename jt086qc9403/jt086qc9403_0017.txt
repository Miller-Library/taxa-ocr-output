for nematodes and turbellarians, the groups of organisms found showed
little overlap in their ranges.
In contrast Sand City transect sites showed clear differences in the
total number of individuals found at the different stations, with a distingt
maximum at Station 1.55. Furthermore, all sites except the highest
contained five or six types of organisms, and these, unlike those of
Del Monte beach, showed much overlap in ranges.
These results lead to several hypotheses about the meiofauna of this
beach by Anderson, et al.(1972).
1. The appearance of greater numbers of organisms at times of
high tide may indicate some sort of vertical migration
associated with the tidal cycle.
2. For this two-week period, the meiofauna maintained stable
ranges and spatial associations. These associations may
form a sandy beach meiofaunal community, dominated numerically
by nematodes except at the terrestrial and marine fringes,
where, respectively, oligochaetes and archiannelids become
dominant. The ranges of each may be most directly related
to tidal level and exposure.
3. Within their ranges, the meiofauna were unevenly distributed.
Their distribution may be related to the irregular distribution
of organic carbon noted by Anderson, Miller, Rabone & Wiggin (1972).
