The overall counting error for specific types was 22%+11%. The
error for overall totals was 21%+10%. Thus, at worst, the counts were
reliable to within one-third of the reported figure.
To assess expected sample variation, I took the mean and the
standard deviation for each type of organism (N915) and for overall totals,
for each triplicate set of samples. I expressed the deviations as
percentages of the means, and found the mean and standard deviation
of the percentages. In these samples, variation for individual types
was 31%+21%. Overall totals varied by 21%+14%.
Hypothetically, the two errors could be cumulative; the reported
figures would then vary by as much as 80% from the actual population
figures. Because of the large margin of possible error the conclusions
drawn from the data depend on both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
