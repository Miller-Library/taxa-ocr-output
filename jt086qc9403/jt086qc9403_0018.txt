4. The maximum abundance at Sand City occurred at mean high
water, in a zone subject twice daily to inundation and heavy
surf. Thus, the stress engendered by extreme and rapid
environmental fluctuations, which seems to be a limiting
factor for the macrofauna of these beaches (Johnson, 1972), is
no inimical to meiofauna.
johnson, in his concurrent study of the same transects, found low
macrofaunal diversity and abundance in the midtidal zone, and maximum
diversity above 2 m and below 1 m tidal height. The only macrofaunal
types found in the midtidal zone were mobile predators.
The distribution of meiofauna neither follows this pattern nor
complements it. At the Del Monte beach, the meiofauna were distributed
evenly along the transect, despite the different zones of environmental
stress and macrofaunal distribution. At the Sand City transect, the
meiofauna were most abundant on either side of the midtidal zone.
That zone is slao within the range of the only predatory macrofaunal
species found on the transect—the glycerid Hemipodus borealis (Johnson)
The irregular distribution of meiofauna within their general ranges,
and the apparent contradictions between meiofaunal and macrofaunal dis¬
tributions relative to the macroenvironment, both suggest that differences
between microhabitats are perhaps as important as macroscopic influences
in determining meiofaunal distribution. If so, then future studies should
concentrate on these microhabitat differences, rather than on traditional
macrohabitat influences on zonation.
