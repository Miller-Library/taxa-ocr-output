Method and Materials
Selection of sampling sites. The Monterey Bay coastline between
Monterey and Fort Ord is ideal for such a study. It is a long, unbroken
sandy beach stretching north for several kilometers from Monterey Harbor
Municipal Wharf +2. As the beach extends to the north, it becomes more
exposed to the open ocean and therefore offers an environment with
unbroken gradients of wave action (Bascom, 1964), sand grain size and
sortment, and organic carbon content (Anderson, Miller, Rabone & Wiggin,1972).
To maximize the physical differences between the beach areas
studied, I chose transects at the extreme ends of the gradients mentioned
above. One site, the Del Monte transect, was 250 m north of Wharf +2
and seemed to have little wave action, relatively fine sand, and a gentle,
even slope. The Sand City transect, 4.6 km north of the Del Monte
transect, had much rougher surf, coarser sand, and a steeper slope.
Sampling procedure. Stations were designated every 9-12 m between
the berm and MLLW (mean lower low water). The Del Monte transect
had five stations, at 2.42, 1.85, 1.23, .58, and .02 m above MLLW,
At the Sand City transect, where the rough surf precluded working too
close to the waves, there were only four stations, at 3.49, 2.37, 1.55,
and .88 m above MLLW. Stations are denoted by their height above MLLW,
