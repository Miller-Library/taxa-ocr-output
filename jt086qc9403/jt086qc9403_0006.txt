Two sets of samples (56 samples in all) were taken. During the
preliminary survey (April 25-27, 1972), a single sample was taken
from each station during the daytime low tide, and another during the
daytime high tide. During the final survey (May 9-10, 1972), triplicate
sets of samples were taken from each station during the daytime high
and low tides. No samples were taken from stations inundated during
high tide.
Physical measurements. For each transect, slope, sand particle
size and sortment, interstitial water content, and interstitial salinity
were measured. I am indebted to Anderson, Miller, Rabone, and Wiggin
(1972), who gathered this data as part of their concurrent study of the
same transects.
Slope was calculated with a line and level. Sand particle size
was obtained by dry sifting through a series of Standard Tyler screens
with mesh sizes of 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.063 mm.
Samples from high, middle, and low beach were sifted. Median particle
diameter and sortment were calculated following the methods of Buchanan
and Kain (1971).
Interstitial water content was estimated by weight loss after drying
to a constant weight. Samples were taken from 15 cm below the surface,
at seven points on each transect.
Permeability was measured with a constant head permeability device,
using sand cores from tidal heights of about 0, 0.6, and 1.8 meters
(Means and Parcher, 1971).
