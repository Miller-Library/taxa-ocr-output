The nereids might easily have been missed at Del Monte. The Del
Monte transect seems to have reached only the extreme edge of the
archiannelids 'range, with which nereids were always associated at
Sand City. Even at Sand City, nereids were always sparse.
On both beaches the meiofauna appeared to maintain constant ranges
and associations on a given beach. However, within their ranges, the
meiofauna were patchily distributed.
Usually, but not always, more individuals were found in the samples
taken at the time of high tide.
The different types of meiofauna seemed to inhabit similar tidal
zones on the beaches. Oligochaetes and collembolids appeared in the
high beach; harpacticoids and ostracods at medbeach; and archiannelids
and nereids in the low mbeach. Nematodes occurred at all levels of
the beach. Turbellarians appeared at all stations below 2.5 m.
Nematodes were the most abundant organism in samples from all
but the highest and lowest stations. At the highest station at Del
Monte, oligochaetes and nematodes codominated; at the highest station
at Sand City, nematodes, oligochaetes and collembolids codominated.
At the lowest stations, archiannelids were most numerous at the Sand
City transect, but not at the Del Monte transect.
The two transects were not similar in all respects. The Del Monte
transect sites contained an average of three types of organisms, and
each site contained roughtly similar numbers of individuals. Except
