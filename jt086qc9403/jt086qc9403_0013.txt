Permeability tests suggested that Sand City transect was more permeable
than Del Monte transect. However, inconsistent results at intermediate
transects implied that the method (which involved repacking sand cores in
the lab) may have given inaccurate results.
Salinity ranged between 3.2-3.4% at all levels on both beaches.
The physical differences between the transects have significant
implications for the meiofaunal inhabitants of the interstitial environment.
The most important of these are:
1. Heavy wave action increases the rate of sand turnover, and,
potentially, the rate of meiofaunal depopulation through
physical disturbance.
2. Large sand particles increase the size of interstitial pores,
which increases the life-space available to meiofauna, and
the rates at which water and detritus can flow through the sand.
3. Small sand particles decrease the size of interstitial pores,
thereby decreasing meiofaunal life-space, and the rates of
water and detrital percolation.
4. Organic carbon, a gross index of the meiofaunal food supply,
was irregularly distributed.
5.
High concentrations of organic carbon, which are encouraged by light
surf and small sand particle size, favor black sulfide layer
formation (Gherini & Swanson, 1972). In their concurrent study
of the Del Monte transect, Gheriniand Swanson found that the
diversity and abundance of meiofauna in the sand above the
layer greatly exceeds that in the black-sulfide layer.
