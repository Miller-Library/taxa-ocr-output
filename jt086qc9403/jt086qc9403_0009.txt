Statistical Accuracy
The study contained three potentially significant sources of error:
inefficiencies in extraction; counting error; and random sampling variaÂ¬
tion.
To check whether the extraction method left significant numbers of
meiofauna in the sand sample, I counted each rinse separately for three
series of ten rinses. In each series, the tenth rinse vielded only
2.5-3% of the total for all ten samples, indicating that most of the
meiofauna had been extragted.
As a further check, each series of counts was graphed in a decreasing
function. By converting the counts to log,, and using least-squares
regression analysis (Snedecor, 1967), I found the exponential curve
most nearly fitting the points. Calculation at the areas under the three
curves showed that the ten rinses captured an estimated 87, 95, and
96 percent of the animals that the methods would ever catch. Compared
with the large counting error and random sample variation, extraction
inefficiency was an insignificant source of error.
To assess counting error, I counted the contents of four Petri dishes,
randomly chosen in my absence from 22 previously counted. I later
learned which dishes I had recounted, and calculated the pergent
difference of the second count from the first, both for each type of
organism, and for the sample total. I then took the mean and the
standard deviation for each set of percentages.
