Discussion
As suggested by Anderson, et al. (1972), transect slope, mean
particle size and sortment, and organic carbon content can be correlated
with relative exposure to heavy surf. Permeability seemed to correlate
with sand particle size and interstitial detrital content.
The Del Monte transect is sheltered from rough surf by Point Pinos
to the west. It has a gentle, even slope, well-sorted medium-size sand,
a high content of organic carbon, and low permeability. A dense black sulfide
layer appears in the lower third of the beach (Gherini & Swanson, 1972).
Sand City is exposed to the open ocean. It has an obvious berm,
intermediately sorted very coarse sand, and a low organic carbon content.
No black sulfide layer is present.
Despite the physical differences between the beaches, the patterns
of meiofaunal distribution on each beach showed some striking similarities.
The two beaches supported the same types of meiofauna, except that no
Euzonus were found at Sand City (see Anderson, et al. 1972), and no
nereids or ostracods appeared at Del Monte.
The ostracods may be excluded from Del Monte by the small
interstitial spaces there; they are the only type whose body is not elongated
and flexible.
