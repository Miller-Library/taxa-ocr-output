Abstract
Counts made from core samples of interstitial meiofauna, taken
two weeks apart, at high and low tide each time, on exposed and
protected transects of a long beach, indicate that on both transects
the meiofauna maintained stable ranges and associations. Meiofauna
of both transects included oligochaetes and collembolids on the high
beach, harpacticoid copepods on the midbeach, archiannelids on the low
beach, and nematodes and turbellarians at all levels. The exposed
transect also contained ostracods (midbeach) and nereid polychaetes
(low beach). Nematodes predominated numerically at all except the
highest and lowest sampling sites. Within their broad ranges the
meiofauna were patchily distributed.
On the protected transect, each site contained about an equal number
of meiofauna. On the exposed beach, meiofauna were most abundant
at mean high water. Overall meiofaunal distribution correlated neither
with macrofaunal distribution, nor with zones of stress associated with
surf or tidal action. This, and their patchy microdistribution, suggest
that meiofauna may be distributed according to microhabitat differences
as much as by macroscopic influences.
