Sand City Transect. Sand City transect contained eight major types
of meiofauna: collembolids, oligochaetes, turbellarians, harpacticoids,
ostracods, nematodes, archiannelids, and nereid polychaetes. Figure 3
shows the abundance and distribution of each. Mites and nemerteans
occurred in insignificant numbers (10 per sample).
The associations at the different sites showed greater diversity, and
more overlapping of ranges, at Sand City than at Del Monte (Fig, 4). The
three lower sites all contained five or six major types of meiofauna. The
uppermost station contained only three types.
Again, the meiofauna were generally, but not consistently, more
numerous at high tide.
The total numbers of organisms differed consistently from site to site
(Fig. 4). Station 3.49 was the most barren of the entire study. Stations
2.37 and .88 contained intermediate numbers. Station 1.55 vielded
greater numbers of meiofauna than any other station of the study.
The meiofauna were again patchily distributed. One triplicate
set of samples yielded total counts of 3,700, 12,500, and 10.900
organisms. Though the numbers fluctuated widely, the types found at
any one site remained constant.
