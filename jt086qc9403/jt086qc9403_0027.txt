Figure Captions
1. Del Monte transect profile, and the mean numbers of the seven
groups of organisms collected, at each site, for each survey.
MHHW, MLHW, MHLW, and MLLW = mean higher high water,
mean lower high water, mean higher low water, and mean lower low
water, respectively. Stations are designated by their height in
meters above MLLW. Preliminary survey taken on April 25-26,1972;
final survey taken on May 9, 1972. Tidal datum is MLLW.
2. Total numbers of organisms per survey at each Del Monte transect
site, with breakdown by types. Outside columns - preliminary
survey; inside columns = means of triplicate samples of the final
survey. Nemat., Turb., Olig., Collemb., Euz., Harp., Archi. -
nematodes, turbellarians, oligochaetes, collembolids, Euzonus,
harpacticoids, and archiannelids, respectively. HT,LT - high tide
and low tide, respectively. 2.42, 1.85, 1.23, .58, .05 = sampling
stations, designated by height in meters above mean lower low water.
3. Sand City transect profile, and the mean number of the eight groups of
organisms collected,at each site, for each survey. MHHW, MLHW,
MHLW, and MLLW = mean higher high water, mean lower high water,
mean higher low water, and mean lower low water, respectively.
Stations are designated by their height in meters above MLLW.
Preliminary survey taken on April 27, 1972; final survey taken on May 10,
1972. Tidal datum is MLLW.
