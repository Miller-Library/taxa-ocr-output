Physical Characteristics of the Transects
The Del Monte and Sand City transects lie at the ends of a series of
six transects studied by Anderson, et al. (1972). The Del Monte transect
is sheltered from the open ocean surf; the Sand City transect is unprotected.
Table I summarizes the data obtained by Anderson, et al. Figures 1 and 3
show profiles of the transects.
The Del Monte transect was even and gently-sloping (5.9%), with
medium-size sand (mean diameter = 400u), well-sorted (6-quartile
deviation = .21) along the entire transect. A distinct black sulfide layer
appeared at stations .58 and .05, about 15 cm below the surface (Gherini
& Swanson, 1972). Mean organic carbon content was 410+98 ug C/gm
dry sand. The data suggest a gradient from the high beach (386 ug) to
the low beach (481 ug). Interstitial water content remained low (6.8%
H,O/gm dry sand) until approximately mean higher high water (MHHW)
below mean lower high water (MLHW) they averaged 24.0%.
The Sand City beach was quite different. It had an obvious berm, a
steeper slope (7.5%), and very coarse sand (mean diameter = 1580 u),
which was not as well sorted (Ã¸-quartile deviation =.4-.5). Organic
carbon content was significantly lower than at the Del Monte transect
(202 ug; t = 7.18 for 2 d.f.). It did not vary greatly between the high beach
(203 ug) and the low beach (200 ug). Interstitial water content followed
a pattern similar to that of Del Monte. Levels were low (3.9%) above
MHHW; below MLHW, it averaged 20%.
