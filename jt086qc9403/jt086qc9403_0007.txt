Interstitial organic carbon content was determined by the wet ashing
technique of Strickland and Parsons (1968). Triplicate samples were
taken from four points, about 18 m apart, on each transect,
At the same four points, at the surface and 15 cm below the surface.
interstitial salinity was measured, using an AO refractometer, which
read directly in parts per thousand.
Meiofaunal Sampling Method. Meiofauna samples were taken by
coring to 30 cm with PVC pipe 4 cm in diameter. Each core contained
about 370-380 ml of sand. Each sample was immediately placed in a
beaker, covered, and sealed. Within three hours, the samples were
returned to the laboratory, and placed in a refrigerator at 4°C. They
remained there for 1-21 days, until the meiofauna were extracted. These
procedures did not seem to alter the meiofaunal counts.
Extraction. After the sand sample had been transferred to an
Erlenmeyer flask, a 7.5% solution of MgCl, was added, and the sample
left for at least twenty minutes. Then the sample was swirled, and the
supernatant poured through a 160-u mesh net. Each sample was decanted
at least five times.
After pouring off the MgCl, solution, I added sea water heated to
60°C, which killed most of the remaining meiofauna. The sample was
swirled and decanted another five times.
A fine jet of sea water was used to clean the net contents into a
Petri dish. I inspected the net visually to make sure it was clean.
