Filtrates from Del Monte stations .58 and .02 invariably contained
large amounts of organic detritus, and required dilution before counting,
The filtrate was transferred to a graduated cylinder, to which artificial
sea water was added. The column was inverted until the contents were
thoroughly mixed, after which a given fraction was poured off for counting,
Counting. All samples were counted under the low power (10.5x)
of a Bausch & Lomb dissecting microscope. Organisms too small to be
seen at that magnification were not counted. Two counting methods were
used.
During the preliminary survey, I counted eight microscope fields in
each Petri dish. The first took in the center of the dish; the rest were
spaced equally around the center. The fields subsumed eight-fifteenths
of the dish surface.
During the final survey, I placed the dish on a 1-cm grid, and
counted every other whole square, in a checkerboard pattern, Fractions
of squares were ignored. The area counted totalled four-tenths of the
dish.
To obtain the estimate for a whole sample, I multiplied the raw
counts of the MgCl, and sea water subsamples by appropriate factors,
and added the two subtotals.
