Meiofaunal Associations
Del Monte Transect. Seven major groups of meiofauna appeared in
the Del Monte transect samples: oligochaetes, collembolids, juveniles of the
polychaete Euzonus dillonensis (Hartman)*, turbellarians, harpacticoid copeÂ¬
pods, nematodes, and archiannelids. Figure 1 shows the abundance and
distribution of each. Nemerteans and mites appeared in insignificant
numbers ((10 per sample).
Nematodes and turbellarians were found at all stations; nematodes
were always abundant. The other meiofaunal types appeared only at one
station each, resulting in specific associations for each tidal level
sampled (Fig. 2). In addition to the nematodes and turbellarians,
oligochaetes and collembolids occurred at station 2.42; juvenile
Euzonus at station 1.85; harpacticoids at station 1.23; and archiannelids
at station .02. Station .58 contained only nematodes and turbellarians.
During the study period, the meiofauna maintained constant ranges.
Their numbers varied both between surveys and among the triplicate samples.
There was a weak tendency for meiofauna to be more numerous in samples
taken during high tide. When compared at similar tidal times, samples
from the different sites contained similar numbers of meiofauna (Fig, 2).
The Euzonus are of meiofaunal size only as juveniles. The adults are
4-5 mm long. The juveniles were found in the same area in which
Anderson, et al., found adults.
