the drift kelp, influencing the C:N value. But because of such low levels of polyphenols,
sea urchins feeding on this drift kelp did not experience nitrogen limitation, and
therefore experienced strong growth (Norderhaug et al., 2003).
This study has shown that kelps differentially allocate both their defensive
chemicals and nutrients in their different tissues. Nutrient values and the concentration
of polyphenols can help determine the importance of certain tissues, in the event kelp
may preferentially defend those tissues most important for growth and reproduction by
decreasing their palatability either through a decrease in the nutrient levels or by an
increase in the polyphenolic concentrations. Sea urchins fed restricted diets on these
different kelp tissues displayed growth rates positively correlated with nutrient levels
and negatively correlated with polyphenolic concentrations. Those fed mature
Macrocystis blades and drift kelp, which are high in nutrients and low in polyphenols,
grew the most, while those fed meristematic tissue, also high in nutrients but
significantly higher in polyphenolic concentrations, grew at a much slower rate. Those
urchins fed sporophylls also grew at a very slower rate, as these tissues have very low
polyphenol values, but also have very low nutrient values. These conclusions help to
clarify herbivore-kelp relationships, and can further develop the complexity present in
giant kelp forest ecosystems. It will be important to further examine how herbivores
may preferentially choose one kelp tissue over another, whether that choice is cased by
differences in nutrient levels or defensive chemicals.
