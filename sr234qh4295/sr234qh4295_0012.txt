of their lack of growth, are sources for nitrogen for the rest of the kelp organism
(Schmitz, 1980; C S Lobban, 1978).
The high relative nutrient levels examined in apical meristems is intriguing. The
high nitrogen levels could signify the large amount of nitrogen transported to the
meristems to support growth (Schmitz, 1980), while the low carbon levels could
represent very high turnover due to the rapid expansion and elongation consuming the
carbon for that growth of the kelp organism.
It has been shown that sporophylls receive significantly less translocated products,
such as nitrogen containing amino acids, than other parts of the kelp, supporting the
finding of the low % nitrogen of the sporophylls (CS Lobban, 1978). The same study
describes sporophylls as growing the slowest of the kelp tissues, which translates to
having the highest carbon levels, as herbivores that have strong growth rates do not
consume as much carbon (C S Lobban, 1978). Because of the high C:N values, and
therefore low nutrient enrichment, these tissues have evolved to need lesser defenses,
as they may not be targeted by certain herbivores. While other experiments have found
reproductive tissue to have high concentrations of defensive chemicals, the low nutrient
levels themselves may be enough to deter herbivores from consuming these important
tissues of the kelp (Tugwell, 1989).
The low concentration of defensive chemicals, like polyphenols, in the drift kelp
samples is supported by past experiments, which have shown that bacterial
degradation of drift kelp decreases the amount of polyphenols produced by the kelp
tissues (Norderhaug et al., 2003; Van Alstyne, McCarthy III, Hustead, & Kearns, 1999).
It is also possible that this bacterial degradation led to a decrease in nitrogen levels in
