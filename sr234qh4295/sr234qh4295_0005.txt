kelp and mature blades should be significantly lower, as their role in the survival of the
kelp is not as vital (Lubchenco & Gaines, 1981).
I also hypothesized the nitrogen levels of the sporophylls and the meristems will be
very low, and the nitrogen levels in drift kelp and the mature blades will be significantly
higher, with lower C:N ratios as a result. Drift kelp refers to any parts of kelp that have
become dislodged from the substrate and drift near the ocean floor (Nosengo, 2011).
Because these tissues do not play as vital a role for the survival of the kelp, their high
nutrient levels do not play a disadvantage for the kelp’s endurance (Jackson, 1977).
The polyphenol levels of these parts will also be significantly lower, as the kelp does not
have incentives to as vigorously protect these tissues (Tugwell, 1989; Van Alstyne,
McCarthy III, Hustead, & Kearns, 1999; Watanabe, 1984). Past studies have also shown
that as kelp undergoes degradation at the hands of microbes, polyphenolic
concentrations have been shown to go decrease significantly (Van Alstyne, McCarthy III,
Hustead, & Kearns, 1999). This microbial breakdown of polyphenols may also decrease
the polyphenolic concentration of the drift kelp.
III. Methods
Field Sampling. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus individuals and tissues from
Macrocystis pyrifera were collected for laboratory experimentation along the California
coast in the Monterey Bay, specifically from the kelp forest adjacent to the Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University (36°36’ N, 121° 54’W). The kelp tissue samples
were collected between the depths of 0 and 10 meters. The collected kelp samples were
