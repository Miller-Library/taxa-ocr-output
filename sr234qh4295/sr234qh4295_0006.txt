kept in a large tub with a continual flow of seawater, while the sea urchins were stored
in an aquarium also with a constant flow of seawater.
Growth Rate Studies. The quality of nutrients of different tissues of kelp as a bio¬
assay for herbivore growth was determined by restricting the diets of
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to those specific tissues in the laboratory, over a period
of two weeks.. In the growth rate trials, four experimental groups of each tissue type
(mature blades, apical meristems, sporophylls, and drift kelp) were used, as well as one
control group, receiving no kelp tissue. For each tissue group, four different arenas
were created to separate the sea urchins and prevent competition. Each arena with a
single urchin was initially provided with 15 grams of kelp tissue (wet weight), after
starving for 72 hours to remove confounding effects of their previous diets.
Before the experiment, each sea urchin’s diameter was measured with vernier
calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. The urchins were placed between the jaws of the
calipers and were rotated until the greatest diameter was determined.
Each arena was subjected to natural light-dark cycles, and provided with a continual
supply of running seawater (n-4). Food was replaced in the arenas ad libitum, when
little food remained. All arenas were maintained with similar amounts of food.
At the end of the experiment, the diameters of the sea urchins were measured in the
same manner as the initial diameters, with the maximum diameter being recorded, to
the nearest 0.1 mm. The growth was then determined, subtracting the initial diameters
from the final diameters.
