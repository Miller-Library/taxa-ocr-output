can also serve as anti-biotic, anti-fungal, and anti-fouling agents (Ragan & Globmtiza
1986, Pavia et al. 1997, Wikstrom and Pavia 2004).
Multiple past studies have examined the variation in phlorotannin concentrations in
the different kelp tissues, but a more detailed understanding of the nutrient variations
that exist in these tissues is essential (Norderhaug, Fredriksen, & Nygaard, 2003). These
studies provide further explanations of the physiological evolution giant kelps have
undergone to protect their most important tissues for growth and development (Van
Alstyne, McCarthy III, Hustead, & Kearns, 1999).
The grazing pressure of herbivores is considered one of the most important factors
affecting the health of kelp beds (Dean et al. 1984, Schiel & Foster 1986). In the
northern pacific, grazing sea urchins have devastated many areas of kelp beds,
developing these once rich ecosystems into what are termed "urchin barens" (Estes &
Duggins 1995). Growth rates of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and other
herbivores, have been examined in past experiments (Ebert, 1968, Swan, 1961,
Watanabe, 1984)), but no research has been carried out to see how restricted diets on
the different kelp tissues of Macrocystis pyrifera affect growth rates of these sea urchins.
This research project specifically examines how kelp tissues differentially partitions
nutrients (as C:N ratios) and polyphenols in its different tissues. The apical meristem,
sporophylls, and mature blades will be the specific parts of the kelp that will be
analyzed, as well as drift kelp. The project will also address how restricted diets on
these specific kelp tissues affect growth rates of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The
data collected from these experiments will provide vital information on the macroalgae-
herbivore interactions present in the Monterey Bay region, and will aid in
