understanding the complex ecosystem present in kelp forests around the world
(Hemmi & Jormalainen, 2002). There has been a lack of research looking at the growth
rates of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and how different allocation of Macrocystis
pyrifera nutrients will affect them. This project will allow for these gaps in knowledge to
be filled.
I hypothesized the levels of nitrogen would be lowest and C:N ratios, as well as the
polyphenol levels, would be highest in the parts of the kelp responsible for growth and
reproduction (apical meristems and sporophylls) (Swan, 1961). Nitrogen levels may be
decreased in the meristems and sporophylls because of the evolutionary advantages
these tissues would experience for being less nutritious to herbivores (Diaz,
Güldenzoph, Molis, McQuaid, & Wahl, 2006). An increase in C:N ratios would
accompany an increase in carbon in the growing apical meristems and sporophylls,
which follow the source-sink phenomenon, which describes the importation of carbon-
rich materials to kelp tissues responsible for growth (C S Lobban, 1978; Schmitz, 1980).
An increase in carbon levels leads to an increase in C:N ratios. C:N ratios help signify
how nutrient rich certain plant material is, as nitrogen plays a major role in the nutrient
requirements of marine organisms (Hamilton, Lange, Boyd, & Peters, 2011). There have
been strong correlations between the amount of nitrogen with respective growth of
organisms (Davies, 1971, Lambers, 1992, (Howarth, Marino, Lane, & Cole, 1988).
Past experimental studies have shown that polyphenol levels are indeed higher for
those tissues that are most important for a kelp’s growth and reproduction, specifically
in the meristems, holdfasts, and sporophylls (Tugwell, 1989; Van Alstyne, McCarthy III,
Hustead, & Kearns, 1999). Based on these results, the polyphenol levels of both drift
