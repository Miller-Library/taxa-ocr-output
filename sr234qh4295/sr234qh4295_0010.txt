V. Discussion
The significance in the difference of growth rates between the sea urchins feeding
on different kelp tissues may further assist in the knowledge of preferential feeding
patterns of these organisms in a kelp forest ecosystem. Many experiments have been
performed to attempt to understand food choice in marine invertebrates (A. G. B. Poore
& P. D. Steinberg, 1999; Wakefield & Murray, 1998; Watanabe, 1984), but little work
has been done linking possible nutrient variations and defensive mechanisms employed
by algae to explain how growth rates of those invertebrates may be different with their
different feeding patterns. The data in these studies leads to the belief that sea urchins
are a good stand in for other herbivores that may benefit from consumption of tissues
that are high in nitrogen levels, low C:N ratios, and low in polyphenol levels.
The growth rates of those sea urchins that have fed on mature blades and drift kelp
is much higher than those growth rates of the urchins feeding on both apical meristems
and sporophylls. For mature blades, their high nutrient levels and low polyphenolic
levels make them very palatable for urchins, thereby providing the ability for strong
growth. Drift kelp, meanwhile, has a somewhat intermediate value of nutrients, but
their significantly low polyphenolic concentrations allow their tissues to be extremely
palatable for the urchins (Tugwell, 1989; Van Alstyne, McCarthy III, Hustead, & Kearns,
