I. Abstract
Some of the most interesting aspects of a kelp forest ecosystem are the herbivore
kelp interactions. Macrocystis pyrifera utilizes different methods to deter consumption by
herbivores. Both nutrient levels and defensive chemical concentrations may be allocated
differently to the different tissues of the kelp, showing defensive preference for those
tissues responsible for growth and reproduction. We examined this nutrient allocation as
well as differential distribution of polyphenolic concentrations in three different tissue
types (mature blades, apical meristems, sporophylls, and drift kelp) of Macrocystis pyrifera,
and those from drift kelp, and analyzed how these differences affected the growth of the
herbivore Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Sea urchins were fed restricted diets of a single
type of algal tissue for 14 days, and their growth rates were compared. Urchins fed a diet of
mature blades experienced the strongest growth, as mature blades had low concentrations
of polyphenols and high nutritional value. Urchins fed diets of both sporophylls and apical
meristems experienced the least growth, as sporopyll and apical meristem tissue
palatability was low, due to either low nutrient levels (sporophylls) or high polyphenolic
concentrations (apical meristems). Urchins fed diets of drift kelp had strong growth rates,
because although drift kelp was low in nutrients, the tissue also contained low
polyphenolic concentrations. We concluded both nutrient allocation as well as differential
polyphenolic concentrations both played roles in palatability of kelp tissues and their effect
on herbivore growth rates.
