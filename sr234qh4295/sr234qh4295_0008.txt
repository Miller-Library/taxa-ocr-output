centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm. 0.1 ml of the ethanol-water fraction is mixed
well with 5 ml of reagent A (75 ml Folin-Ciocalteu reagent made up to 750 ml with DI
water). After 0.5-8 minutes, 3.5 ml of reagent B is added (57.5 g sodium carbonate
dissolved in 500 ml of DI water). The tubes were then incubated at 40° C for an hour.
After incubation, 1 ml of the mixture was added to a cuvet, and the absorption at 765
nm was measured with a spectrophotometer. A standard solution of 0.05 g of p-
Coumaric acid was dissolved in 2 ml 96% ethanol and filled up to 50 ml of DI water. The
standard was diluted to a range of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 mg/ml. After
determination of the standard curve, the measured absorption allowed for the
calculation of polyphenolic concentration of the tissues.
Statistical Analyses. Single-factor ANOVA testing was used to test and analyze all
data, including polyphenolic levels, nutrient levels (nitrogen levels, carbon levels, and
C:N ratios), and the effect of tissue identity on growth rates. Significant (Pæ0.05) tissue
nutrients and growth rate results were used to indicate whether certain tissues were
beneficial for the growth of sea urchins and also what defensive mechanisms kelp
organisms may employ.
IV. Results
The growth rates of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus differed significantly (p-0.0006)
when feeding on restricted diets of the different tissues of kelp. Figure 1 shows the
averages of the growth rates of the sea urchins feeding on different diets of the kelp
tissues. Sea urchins fed the mature blades had the highest average growth at 0.136 mm
per 2 weeks, while those fed apical meristems grew the least, on average 0.0422 mm;
