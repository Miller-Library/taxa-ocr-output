II. Introduction
Kelp forests ecosystems provide a complex home to numerous organisms, including
invertebrates, herbivores, including echinoderms, gastropods, amphipods, and isopods
(Barrales & Christopher S. Lobban, 1975). It has been shown that herbivore-feeding
habits can exert a certain pressure on the evolution of kelps and the allocation of their
defenses, such as polyphenolic/phlorotannin concentrations (Hay & Fenical, 1988,
Wright, De Nys, Poore, & Steinberg, 2004). The relationship between these herbivores
and the giant kelp dominating the kelp forest ecosystems of the west coast of North
America, Macrocystis pyrifera, is vital for understanding kelp forest ecosystem dynamics
as a whole (Watanabe, 1984, Foster and Schiel, 1985, Wakefield, 1998).
Macrocystis pyrifera is comprised of many different types of tissues, including
meristems, reproductive tissues, and the non-reproductive tissue of the kelp blades
(Van Alstyne, McCarthy III, Hustead, & Kearns, 1999). The meristematic tissue of kelp is
responsible for the growth of the organism, while the reproductive tissue, or
sporophyll, is responsible for the production of the spores used in reproduction
(Barrales & Christopher S. Lobban, 1975). The non-reproductive tissue refers to the
blades of the organism, and is responsible for the majority of photosynthetic activity. It
has been shown that these different tissues may utilize different methods in the defense
of their parts, possibly both chemical defenses and differential nutrient allocations are
used (Bazzaz and Grace, 1997). Some of the specific anti-herbivore chemical defenses
include the production of polyphenols and/or phlorotannins on the surface of the kelp
tissues (Tugwell, 1989; Van Alstyne, McCarthy III, Hustead, & Kearns, 1999).
Phlorotannins are polymers of phloroglucinol and are ubiquitous in brown algae, and
