Nutrient and Polyphenol Determination. In order to determine both the nutrient
and polyphenol levels in the different tissues of the kelp, 10 g of kelp (wet weight) were
dried at 120° C for 48 hours. The dried kelp samples were then removed, and placed in
canisters of a Wiley ball mill for 30 seconds ensuring grinding into fine powder. This
kelp tissue powder was then used in the determination of nutrient allocation (n-5) as
well as the polyphenol concentrations (n-4).
To determine the nitrogen and carbon levels in the different kelp tissues, the
powder of the dried tissues was processed in a Carlo Erba CN Elemental Analyzer. 4-7
mg of powder was measured by microscale and placed in tin capsules for carbon and
nitrogen content, and these tins, after being placed in the analyzer, were run. A
standard curve was developed before the procedure with acetanilide, and applied to the
experimental samples for standardization.
For determination of the polyphenol levels, -75 mg of the dried tissue sample was
used according to a modified Folin-Ciocalteu method, according to Hendrik Poorter &
Yvonne de Jong-Van Berkel, from Utrecht University (Van Alstyne, 1995). In this revised
method, the dry plant material was first extracted with 5 ml of 80% ethanol in a
centrifugation tube. The tubes were placed in a heating block for 30 minutes at 30° C,
and then centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes. After the supernatant had been
removed, the pellet was extracted for a second time with 2.5 ml of 80% ethanol, and
again placed in a heating block for 30 minutes at 30° C. After a second centrifugation at
4500 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was removed and added to the supernatant
from the first extraction. To remove chlorophyll, the pellet was extracted a third time
with 5 ml chloroform and 2.5 ml deionized water. The chloroform is removed after
