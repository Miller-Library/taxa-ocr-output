1999). With their low polyphenolic values, the urchins may be able to consume enough
drift kelp to satisfy their nutrient needs, and allow for another strong growth rate.
The lower growth rates of urchins fed both sporophylls and apical meristems seem
to follow the hypotheses that organisms have evolved to allocate their defenses in such
a way as to enhance survival (Rhoades, 1979; Tugwell, 1989). While sporophylls have
extremely low values of nitrogen, and the highest of C:N values, apical meristems had
the second highest percentage of nitrogen, and the second lowest value of C:N, which
could possibly lead to increased grazing by herbivores, if no other protective
mechanism were present. So in order to protect these extremely important tissues for
growth, kelp has evolved to allocate very high concentrations of polyphenols to these
tissues. Because of this high concentration, apical meristem tissues may not be
palatable to urchins, and therefore the urchins fed restricted diets of meristematic
tissue will be unable to consume this tissue, and will therefore be unable to obtain
enough nutrients to support growth. For those urchins on diets of sporophylls,
however, they are not deterred to consume the tissue of the sporophylls, but the lack of
nutrients does not support strong growth.
The high levels of nutrients in the mature blades can be explained by the notion that
because of the relative lack of their necessity to growth and reproduction, as the
meristems and sporophylls are. As a result, the plant may not need to protect these
tissues in any manner, and have evolved to decrease the amount of costly chemical
defenses to these tissues. The high nitrogen levels are explained by the source-sink
theory, which says that mature blades produce an excess of nitrogen levels, and because
