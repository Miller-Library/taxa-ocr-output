those fed sporophylls 0.0558 mm, and those fed drift kelp grew 0.114 mm. A control
group of sea urchins fed nothing grew on average only 0.015 mm.
The results from the nutrient allocation in the different parts of the kelp are
significant, in terms of % nitrogen levels, % carbon levels, and C:N ratios (P= 0.0001,
0.0008, and 0.0012 respectively). Figure 2 displays the % nitrogen levels from the
different parts of kelp. The average for the mature blades was 2.838%, apical
meristems 2.318%, sporophylls had the lowest value of 1.446%, and drift kelp had
1.911% nitrogen.
Figure 3 displays the % carbon levels from the different kelp tissues involved in the
experiment. The average % carbon level for mature blades was 24.182%, apical
meristems with the lowest average of 20.433%, sporophylls with 28.051%, and drift
kelp with the highest average of 29.231%.
Based off these % carbon and nitrogen values, C:N ratios could be calculated. Figure
4 shows these C:N results for their respective tissues of kelp. Mature blades had an
average C:N value of 8.573, the lowest value of the experimental variables. Apical
meristems had the next lowest value, of 8.857, sporophylls had the highest ratio of
19.560, and drift kelp had a C:N value of 15.399.
The polyphenol values for the different kelp tissues were also significant
(P=0.0022). Figure 5 shows the respective values of the polyphenolic concentrations
measured from the different tissues. Apical meristems had the significantly highest
value of 0.202 mg/ml, while drift kelp had the lowest value of 0.00585 mg/ml, mature
blades with 0.0273 mg/ml, and sporophylls with a concentration of 0.0121 mg/ml.
