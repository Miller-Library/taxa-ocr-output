Respiration in Dodecaceria

INTRODUCTION
Dodecaceria fewkesi was first described from California
by Fewkes (1889) under the name Sabella pacifica. Moore
(1909, 1923) later reclassified it with regards to specie and
genera, and Berkeley and Berkeley (1954) recently elaborated
on Moore's description.
This specie is distinguished from others in the family
Lirratulidae by the presence of setae resembling acicular
spines distally spoon shaped, construction of its own calcar-
eous tube masses, and its dark green to black color in life
(Blake, 1975). Dodecaceria fewkesi lives in asexually repro-
ducing clones. It has not yet been experimentally established
uhether autotomery precedes regeneration or schizametamery
(Dehorne, 1933) occurs.
I chose Dodecaceria fewkesi for these experiments because
I was particularly interested in respiratory rates under dif-
ferent conditions and stresses experienced by an intertidal
tube dweller. There appears to be atleast one previous inves-
tigation of the influence of the natural tubal environment
on respiratory metabolism of Polychaetes (Fox, 1938), and a
few authors (Hyman, 1932 and Courtney,1958) have studied the
effect of life in glass tubes.
