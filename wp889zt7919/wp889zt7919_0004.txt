Respiration in Dodecaceria
B. L. Gasior
Ihe duration of all experiments ranged from ten to twelve
hours between 0600 and 2400; readings were taken every hour.
Ihe vessels were immersed in a constant temperature water bath
at 19Â°C, and shaken at a rate of 50 per minute. Instant ocean
was the aqueous medium used throughout the experiments, and
the gas phase was air. Respiratory rates were calculated as
Al gram wet weighthour.
RE SULT
All results of these experiments are summarized in lable
I. These values for respiratory rate will be compared below
for the different experimental conditions used. However, one
must first consider the possible contribution of the respir-
atory rates of non-worm tubular material to the values given
in Experiments I and IV. To examine this question I determined
the respiratory rate of the tubular mass in the Warburg vessels
in 17 experiments. The resulting rates varied inconsistently,
and in some experiments live worms were found in the tubes.
According to Berkeley and Berkeley (1954), even one single
segment of Dodecaceria may have regenerative powers. Since
in breaking up the tubes, a single segment or more of worm
was often times left behind, I attributed the small respira-
tory rates obtained to this fact. No correction was therefore
applied for respiration of the tubes.
