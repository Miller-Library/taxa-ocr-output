Respiratory rates of worms in water were significantly
higher than those in air, both in and out of tubes, The beÂ¬
haviour of Dodecaceria has not been studied in its natural
tube, however, perhaps D. fewkesi has the same capabilities
as stated for Arenicola and Nereis by Wells (1949). He contends
that both Arenicola and Nereis can, when the water level falls
below that of the burrow openings, resort to aerial respira-
tion by trapping bubbles in the water which remains in the
burrow. This ability could be important for intertidal species
experiencing long exposure, both for obtaining oxygen to main-
tain the standard metabolic rate, and in preventing CO, build-
up, but there are no experimental data. De-tubed worms placed
in air, assumingly, are under great stress because they are
not receiving a constant fresh supply of sea water. The slight
drying of their integument may be enough to initiate decreased
respiration. A decrease in activity may also explain the de-
creased respiration, but it is yet unknown whether activity
is substantially decreased when these worms are exposed at
low tide.
The comparison of respiratory rates of whole and headless
worms in air and water will be found in the following section.
