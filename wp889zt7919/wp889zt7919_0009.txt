Respiration in Dodecaceria
B. L. Gasior
DISCUSSION
Bounhiol found respiratory rates of Cirratulids small
compared with values obtained for active errant forms of
Nereis and Nephtys, and for Arenicola, Amphitrite, and Sabella
pavonina. He attributed this low metabolic rate to the small
amount of muscular activity, but his results must be interpreted
with caution because of the inadequacy of methods for quanti¬
tative work in 1903. Courtney (1958) stated that the intertidal
Cirratulid Polychaetes Audouinia tentaculata, Lirratulus cir-
ratus, and Dodecaceria concharnum do not irrigate their burrows.
Both food and oxygen are obtained from the surface of the habitat
by means of branchial and tentacular filaments.
Many conflicting data have been compiled on respirometry
of various other Polychastous Annelids. Ewer & Fox (1940) con¬
tend that 0 consumption of Sabella varies with 0, tension,
while Hyman (1932) holds that the fall in 0, consumption with
time in Nereis virens is largely conditioned by some other
factor(s) than the fall in 0, content of its environment.
The worms showed a relatively constant respiratory rate over
the duration of each of my experiments. This trend is in accor¬
dance with the findings of Dolk & Paauw (1929). They found that
earthwormscare efficient breathers, respiring at a constant
rate down to 1/8 the 0, concentration of air.
Fox (1938) showed that O, consumption of S. spallanzanii
declined progressively after the removal of the worm from its
