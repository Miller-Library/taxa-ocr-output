In water there was no significant difference between
respiratory rates in and out of their natural tubes. In air,
however, the respiratory rate of worms out of tubes was higher
than that of worms in tubes.
Perhaps the respiratory rates of worms in and out of tubes
in water were not significantly different because there is a
layer of water surrounding the animal in its natural tube,
and placing it in water out of its tube was not dramatically
stressful. I observed that worms out of their tubes in water
maintained their natural U-folded position, and did not aggre-
gate as they did in air.
The significant difference in rates in and out of their
tubes in air may be attributed to the left-over water in their
tubes as opposed to their semi-dry integument, which was most
likely a very stressful situation.
