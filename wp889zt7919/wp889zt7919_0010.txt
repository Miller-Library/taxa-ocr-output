hatural tube. The decline of S. pavonina was shown to be
negligible during the first 5 hours of de-tubing. Hyman
(1932) , with respect to Nereis virens, showed that O, uptake
was higher in worms unenclosed than worms enclosed in glass
tubes. My results are not in accord with these findings for
a significantly lower value was not found for worms out of
their tubes.
CONCLUSTON
It seems as though the intertidal specie of Dodecaceria fewkesi
can adjust its respiratory rates to meet different stresses.
My experimental results seem more consistent with those of
the earthworm (Dolk & Paauw, 1929). Much more work needs to
be done on the respiratory rates of invertebrates, for there
seems to be no uniformity in the results relating 09 consump-
tion to 0, tension or habitat. As Hemmingsen suggests (1950)
and Courtney (1958) states, "...it is clear that among the
Polychaetes there is considerable variation in the absolute
values of the respiratory rates, owing to diversity of way
of life...'
