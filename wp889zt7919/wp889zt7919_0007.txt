A. IN UATER
It is interesting to note that the respiratory rate of
whole worms in water is not significantly different from that
of worms out of their tubes in water. However, headless worms
in water had a respiratory rate 5 times as high as whole worms
under the same conditions. I feel the remarkable significant
difference noted in the rates under these conditions can be
attributed, in large, to regenerative properties of this specie.
The standard metabolism during growth is known to be appreciably
higher than during adulthood (Hemmingsen, 1950 ).
Much research has been done on the role of a crown or
anterior branchial filaments in respiration.(Zoond, 1931 and
Wells, 1949a, 1952 and Courtney, 1958 ). Wells concluded that
the localisation of oxygen uptake depends more on behaviour
than anatomy (1952).
