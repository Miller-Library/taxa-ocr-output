ABSTRACT
Respiratory rates of the common California intertidal
Polychaete Dodecaceria fewkesi were measured under different
experimental conditions using Warburg constant- volume
respirometry. At a constant temperature of 19Â°C, mean respir-
atory rates ranged from 69.08 to 648.61 1 09 / gram worm/
hour (wet weight), depending upon the environmental conditions.
No significant difference was found between the rates in and
out of their natural tubes in water, whereas in air the res-
piratory rate was higher out of their tubes. Respiratory rates
in water were significantly higher than those in air under
all conditions. Headless worms had a much higher respiratory
rate than whole worms.
