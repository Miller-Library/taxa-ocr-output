B. IN AIR
The significantly lower respiratory rate found for whole
worms as opposed to headless worms in air may be due to the
innate fact that whole worms are not regenerating. Being
exposed in air is a stressful enough situation to lead to a
decreased respiratory rate.
C. UHOLE UORMS
In comparing the respiratory rates of whole worms in air
and water one sees that they are in accord with those out of
tubes in air and water. The lower respiratory rate in air can
most likely be accounted for by a decrease in activity.
D. HEADLESS UORMS
The respiratory rate of headless worms in water is seen
to be slightly more than 5 times their respiratory rate in
aif. I believe they are maximizing efficiency of metabolism
while in water. There are most likely some essential elements
in water for regeneration, respiration, and other metabolic
functions that are missing in air. Perhaps their activity is
always highest while immersed in water, in compensation for
the time spent exposed during low tides. It would be to any
intertidal animal's advantage to function in this manner.
