Worms were collected on April 25, 1976, from rocks at
the zero to negative one foot tide level along the boat works
beach of Cannery Row, Monterey Bay, California. A chisel and
hammer were used to break chunks of the calcareous tube masses
from the rocks. The worms were brought to the laboratory and
kept in aquaria of running sea water at an average temperature
of 12°C at Hopkins Marine Station.
In preparation for these experiments I chiselled off
smaller chunks of tubes from the colony a minimum of twelve
hours before each run. Uhen I needed worms out of their natural
tubes I placed the tubes with worms in 100% Mocl, solution
for approximately 45 minutes before carefully chopping up the
tube chunks into even smaller pieces, and extracting the worms
with a pair of fine forceps. I tried to be as gentle as possible,
but it is virtually impossible to cut off a portion of the
colony without harming at least a few of the inhabitants.
Animals in each vessel were weighed after extraction from tubes,
and before experiments run out of tubes. The animals were placed
on a KIMWIPE for ten minutes before weighing; the weight of
worms varied from 0.03 to 2.37 grams/ vessel. After extraction
from tubes I counted the number alive, dead, whole, and head¬
less, and weighed the tubular mass. On handling, these worms
secrete a pigment from the skin, which has been characterized
by R.P. Dales (1963).
