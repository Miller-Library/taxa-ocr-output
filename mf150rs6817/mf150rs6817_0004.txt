Prior sequencing of RyRs indicated that a high level of homology existed
among isoforms and species in portions of the channel region (Hakamata et al.,
1992). PCR primers specific to one of these regions in Makaira nigricans (blue
marlin) RyRI sequence were used to amplify sequence RyR in the species
mentioned above. Attempts at isolating other existing isoforms were done in this
conserved region because the primers were more likely to anneal to all of the
isoforms.
Two patterns of transmembrane sites have been proposed for the RyR
channel region: the first hypothesizes that four transmembrane locations exist
while the second proposes twelve transmembrane sites (Zorzato et al., 1990;
Takeshima et al., 1989) . Location of transmembrane sites has been predicted by
the pattern and hydrophobic character of amino acids in a portion of the
molecule. The region sequenced in these experiments has been suggested to
contain three of the twelve predicted transmembrane sites and one of the four
hypothesized locations. Recent experiments done by Grunwald, et al. using site
directed antibodies, provide support for the four site model (Grunwald et al.,
1995) Comparisons of RyRs from higher vertebrates with RyRs of more
primitive vertebrates may provide another approach to examining this structural
question. This leads to a second question for investigation: what clues do the
sequences obtained in this study provide about structure and/or function in this
region of the RyR?
Expression of RyRI in amphioxus and shark was determined in these
experiments. Two amphioxus clones were sequenced and found to have different
amino acid translations. Alignment of amphioxus and shark sequences with RyR
from other species showed a high level of homology with the exception of a
variable region that was approximately 50 amino acids. This variable region
contained a hypothesized transmembrane region. Despite the residue changes.
