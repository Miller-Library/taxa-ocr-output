Introduction
Intracellular calcium release in muscle cells is controlled by the ryanodine
receptor (RyR), a large protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The
ryanodine receptor allows calcium, stored in the SR, to be released into the
cytosol during excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. The ryanodine receptor is
localized at triad junctions, sites where the SR associates with specialized
inpocketings of the muscle cell membrane called transverse (T) tubules. At these
triad junctions, the cytosolic domain of the RyR forms "foot" structures which
span the gap between the SR and T tubules. The RyR is necessary for signal
transduction between these two membranes in E-C coupling (Sorrentino et al.,
1993).
A combination of four identical monomers of more than 5,000 amino acids
each forms the calcium release channel. Of these 5,000, only 1,000 residues
make up the pore, or channel, which is inserted into the SR. These pore amino
acids are found at the carboxy terminus of the RyR and are highly conserved
between isoforms and species. The bulk of the protein closest to the N-terminus
is cytosolic, and is thought to form the foot structure (Sorrentino et al., 1993;
Grunwald et al., 1995)
Two models for RyR control of calcium release have been proposed. In
the first model, direct mechanical coupling of an RyR to a dihydropyridine
receptor (DHPR) in the T tubule membrane triggers calcium release by the RyR
upon excitation (O'Brien et al., 1995) Calcium-induced calcium release, the
second method of modulation, requires extracellular calcium. In this proposed
pathway, a calcium current through the DHPR activates the RyR. (Herrmann-
Frank et al., 1991) When RyRs are located next to each other, a two component
mechanism has been proposed. Calcium release via direct mechanical coupling
