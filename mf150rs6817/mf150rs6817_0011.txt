(Table 1). As the alignment indicates, the most variation among all sequences
occurs between aa 10 and aa 30 and between aa 40 and aa 90, while the rest of
the sequence region has a high level of homology. Hydrophilicity profiles reflect
this overall high level of homology among amphioxus, shark, blue marlin
(fishRyR1), and frog alpha (Figure 4).
Figure 5 is a parsimony tree including the same species shown in the
alignment (Figure 3). The tree was resampled by bootstrapping 500 times and
the numbers at each node represent the percentage of trees in which this node
occurred. In 45.2% of the trees, rabbit cardiac, rabbit brain, and frog beta
sequences were further separated into their own clade. Since this bootstrap value
was less that 50%, this node was collapsed back. A distance tree based on the
number and types of amino acid changes among sequences was derived for these
species as well (Figure 6). The lengths of the branches correlate to distance in an
evolutionary time scale.
