possibility is that the RyR of tunicates may differ enough from blue marlin RyRI
that the primers will not anneal.
The Amphó and Amph10 clones are most homologous to each other and
differ from the other RyR sequences to a similar extent. The differences between
the Amph6 and Amph10 clones in this sequenced region may be due to
sequencing problems. However, the possibility of these clones coming from
different types of RyR cannot be ruled out at this point. Resequencing of these
clones would be necessary for demonstrating the veracity of these sequences.
Since these sequences are from CDNA made from RNA, inconsistencies in how
introns are spliced from this region during transcription might also explain the
sequence differences. However, when this portion of the sequence is aligned
with Drosophila RyR, the entire region falls within an exon on the Drosophila
sequence (Takeshima et al., 1994).
The next step in determining the pattern of isoform expression in
amphioxus might be to sequence further along the RyR. If the two amphioxus
clones are from different RyR types, comparisons at some of the more diverse
regions may show a step along the way in the branching off of the different
isoforms. Isolation of RyR from tunicates would be very useful in drawing a
more complete picture because it is a relatively close ancestor to amphioxus.
Obtaining RyR sequence from larval tunicates might be more feasible since at
this stage in life, the tunicates have tails designed for locomotion. With
adulthood the tunicates become benthic and resorb their tails, losing the muscle
present in this appendage. Although adult tunicates do require some sort of
musculature to pump water for feeding, it is presumably less than that of the
larval tail (Minkoff, 1983).
RyR3-specific primers would be a useful tool in determining the presence
of this isoform in tissues where it is coexpressed with RyRI and RyR2.
