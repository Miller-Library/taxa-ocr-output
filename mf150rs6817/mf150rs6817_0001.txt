Abstract
A highly conserved portion of the RyR channel region was amplified.
cloned and cycle sequenced from Brachiostoma lanceolatum (amphioxus) and
Mustelus californicus (smoothhound dogfish). Two isoforms, RyRI and RyR3,
are expressed in most vertebrate skeletal muscle, while RyRI is the sole isoform
expressed in mammalian and some reptilian skeletal muscle. The purposes of
this study were 1) to investigate how primitive the two isoform condition is, and
2) to determine what clues the sequences of primitive vertebrate RyRs provide
about structure and/or function in the channel region. In comparisons with
published RyR sequences, amphioxus and shark displayed an overall high level
of sequence identity with all isoforms in this region. Molecular phylogenetic
analyses clustered the amphioxus and shark sequences with the published RyRl
sequences. One region of 50 contiguous amino acids located within a possible
transmembrane region did display high variability among species. However,
hydrophilicity profiles of amphioxus, shark, fish RyRI, and frog alpha sequences
in this region revealed similar patterns of hydrophobicity. This common
characteristic indicates that the amino acid differences most likely do not impact
on structure or function in this region.
