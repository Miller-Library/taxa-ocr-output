Discussion
Sequences obtained in these experiments are just a beginning step in
explaining isoform expression in early and pre-vertebrates. While the data do not
indicate clearly whether amphioxus and shark specifically have one or two
isoforms, they do strongly suggest that amphioxus and shark express RyRl. This
result is not surprising since the expression of RyRI seems to be common to all
vertebrate skeletal muscles that have been characterized. Further support for the
presence of RyRI in amphioxus is the similarity in E-C coupling mechanisms in
amphioxus twitch muscle and vertebrate skeletal muscle suggesting that they
have similar ryanodine receptors (Benterbusch et al., 1992). Expression of
RyRl in shark is expected based on immunoblotting experiments done by
O'Brien et al. which indicated the presence of both RyRI and RyR3 in shark
skeletal muscle (O'Brien et al., 1993).
Comparisons of the hydrophilicity profiles for amphioxus and shark with
those of fish alpha and frog alpha reflect the sequence variability between aa 40
and aa 70 of the sequences shown in Figure 4. The presence of hydrophilic
amino acids located between aa 60 and aa 65 could suggest that this portion of
the protein is not in the membrane of the SR (Figure 6). The hydrophilic
character of this region may also indicate that this small region is more likely
found in the cytosol, perhaps on the surface of the folded protein. However, the
overall hydrophobicity seems to be maintained in these sequences from
amphioxus and shark. Therefore, the numerous changes in amino acids in this
region are unlikely to impact structural or functional interpretation of this region
to a high degree.
