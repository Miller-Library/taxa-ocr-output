Figure 6. Distance tree generated by PHYLIP Protdist and Neighbor programs
using a CLU
ISTALV multiple alignment of derived sequences. The algorithm to
determine branch lengths was provided by the Dayhoff PAM matrix which
weights amino acid changes by predicting the probability of a specific amino acid
switch. Drosophila is the designated outgroup.
