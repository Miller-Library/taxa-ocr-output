However, it is this coexpression which makes development of a probe very
difficult. RyR3 seems to be expressed at much lower levels than RyRI and RyR2
in all tissues (Sorrentino et al., 1993). Therefore, the chances of isolating RyR3
from any tissue using non-RyR3 specific probes are not high. These factors, in
addition to the difficulties in finding a distinct yet highly conserved region of the
RyR3, make this project a difficult undertaking.
Results from this study have shown that amphioxus and shark do express
RyRI. In alignments with other RyRl sequences, a small region of high
variability was present in amphioxus and shark. However, as the hydrophilicity
profiles indicated, these amino acid differences have not appreciably changed the
pattern of hydrophobicity in this region. Overall, sequences obtain for these
species demonstrated high level of homology with RyRI sequences from other
vertebrate species.
