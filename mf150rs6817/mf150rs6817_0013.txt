Previous alignments of the entire RyR sequences were used by the Block
lab to construct a parsimony tree. In this tree, fish alpha and frog alpha were
grouped in the same clade. The parsimony tree completed for the regions
sequenced in this experiment places fish alpha, amphioxus and shark into a
separate clade. This raises the questions, 1) would the same division occur ir
more of the sequences of amphioxus and shark were compared and if this is the
case. 2) where in the phylogenetic tree does this split between frog and these
other species occur? Isolation of RyR from species such as lungfish, bowtin and
birchirs which branch off of the vertebrate phylogenetic tre between bony fisn
and amphibians might help answer this second question. The distance tree also
groups amphioxus, shark and fish alphas apart from frog alpha, posing similar
questions.
In the distance tree, an amino acid change is weighted based on the
frequency with which that amino acid occurs in the entire sequence. Branch
lengths are meant to reffect distance on an evolutionary time scale. The large
branch lengths separating amphioxus and shark from fish suggest that these two
groups are more evolutionarily distant than the parsimony tre might indicate.
However, a distance tree which weights amino acid changes based on
composition, polarity, and molecular volume may provide a better representation
of relative branch distances.
There are several possible explanations for the lack of a POR product of
predicted size with tunicates. The most obvious problem may have been with the
quality of tunicate RNA Or CDNA. However, UV spectrophotometty of each orf
these indicated that the both the RNA and CDNA were of high quality. Four
attempts at priming with RyR Bam and RyR Eco were made, but perhaps more
PCR trials should be conducted trying different PCR conditions. Another
