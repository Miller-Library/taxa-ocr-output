Materials and Methods
Tissue Isolation
Amphioxus and hagfish tissue samples were obtained from Pacific
Biomarine (Venice, CA). Muscle tissues from smoothhound shark and blue
marlin were taken from specimens collected by the Block lab (Kona, HA, 1993).
Tunicate specimens were a kind gift of Dr. Doug Stoner, Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, CA.
Blue marlin, shark, hagfish and amphioxus tissues were freeze clamped
and stored at -80’C. Tunicate specimens were used immediately upon acquisition
and did not need to be freeze clamped for storage purposes.
RNA Isolation
Tissue samples of 200 mg to 500 mg were placed in Tri Reagent
(Molecular Research Center, Inc, Cincinnati, ÖH). Samples were minced
thoroughly with a Tekmar homogenizer and RNA was isolated according to the
manufacturers specifications. RNA pellets were washed with 70% EtÖH (1 ml
per sample) and centrifuged at room temperature for 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm.
The pellets were dried, resuspended in Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) -treated
H9O (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and combined to form one sample of 100 ul total
volume.
CDNA
Total RNA (20-40 vg) in 18 ul of DEPC-treated H2O was used to make
CDNA. To this RNA, 0.05 vg/vL Oligo dT’s (2 vl) were added and the resulting
solution was heated to 95°C for five minutes and then quick chilled on ice. 5 x
Buffer (12 vl), 10 mM dNTPs (2 vl) (Promega, Madison, WI), and DEPC-treated
