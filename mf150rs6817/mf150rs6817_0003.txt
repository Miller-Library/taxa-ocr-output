may trigger calcium-induced calcium release in a neighboring ryanodine receptor
(O'Brien et al., 199
At least three different RyR isoforms have been found in muscle and other
cell types. RyRI was first isolated from skeletal muscle and is proposed to
function via direct mechanical coupling (Takeshima et al., 1989; Zorzato et al.,
1990). RyR2 and RyR3 were first found in cardiac and brain tissues respectively.
These two isoforms are thought to employ calcium-induced calcium release
(Hakamata et al., 1992)
A pattern of isoform expression in skeletal muscles has been described by
O'Brien et al (O'Brien et al., 1993). In most vertebrates that have been surveyed,
two RyR isoforms (alpha and beta) which correspond to RyR 1 and RyR2 are
expressed. However, only the RyRI isoform has been isolated from skeletal
muscles in mammals and some reptiles. Based on this pattern of expression it has
been suggested that the more primitive condition is the expression of two
isoforms in skeletal muscle.
Little is known about isoform expression prior to shark along the vertebrate
phylogenetic tree. This raises the question: how primitive is this two isoform
condition? Since the condition of having two isoforms appears to be more
primitive, then this coexpression is expected in species at the based of the
vertebrate tree. In an attempt to begin answering this question, one purpose of
this study was to extend observations of isoform expression further back in time
by obtaining sequence from the RyRs of primitive vertebrates such as
Brachiostoma lanceolatum (amphioxus), Myxine glutinosa (hagfish), and
Botryllus schlosseri (tunicates). Sequencing of Mustelus californicus
(smoothhound dogfish) skeletal muscle RyR was also attempted to try to verify
the presence of two isoforms.
