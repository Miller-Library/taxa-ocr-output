Figure Legends
Figure 1. PCR detection of recombinants. PCR products were fractionated on
1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV light.
Bands at approximately 670 bp represent vectors containing clones. Molecular
weight markers are given to the left of the figure.
Figure 2. Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of shark and amphioxus.
Figure 3. MacVector 4.0 multiple sequence alignment of derived amino
sequences. Dots indicate sequence identity to the top sequence (Shark17). Gaps
in sequences are represented as dashes. The region of high variability referred to
in the text is located between aa 40 and aa 90. Lines over portions of the Sharkl /
sequence indicate locations of hypothesized transmembrane sites (Zorzato et al.,
1990; Takeshima et al., 1989).
Figure 4. Hydrophilicity profiles generated by MacVector 4.0. Values above the
zero line indicate regions of hydrophilic residues. Program utilizes à kyte¬
Doolittle algorithm.
Figure 5. Parsimony tree generated from a CLUSTALV multiple alignment of
derived amino acid sequences by PHYLIP Protpars. Values given at nodes of
tree are percentages of 500 bootstrap replicates in which the node occurred.
Drosophila is the designated outgroup.
