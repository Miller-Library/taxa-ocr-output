and incubated overnight at 37°C. Color selection was used to determine which
colonies had successfully taken up the vector
PCR Detection and Plasmid Purification
PCR detection of recombinants was done using 1 mM M13-20 (forward)
primer, 1 mM M13-Reverse primer, and 3 mM MgCl. PCR cycle conditions
were the same as described above. 2 vl of LB with 50 ug/ml ampicilin were used
to grow up the transformed cells. The purifications of the plasmid DNA were
done with the Wizard Miniprep DNA Purification Systems (Promega, Madison,
WI following manufacturer's procedures.
Cycle Sequencing
1 ug of each clone, PRISM Ready Reaction Terminator mix (Applied
Biosystems), and either 3.2 pM M13-20 and M13-R were used for the sequencing
reactions. For PCR of the sequencing reactions, 25 cycles of the following
conditions were used; 95°C for 5 min; 95°C for 1 min; 55°C for 1 min, 30 sec;
70
12°C for 2 min; 72°C for 7 min. Following PCR the unincorporated nucleotides
were removed using G50 Sephadex spin columns (Promega, Madison, WI).
Polyacrylamide denaturing gels (6%) were used for sequencing the clones
on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Sequences were edited with
SeqEdl.03 from Applied Biosystems.
Analysis of Sequences
Comparisons of the experimental sequences with those listed in
GENBANK were done via the NCBI BLAST E-mail server (Altschul et al.,
1990). Consensus sequences were made in AssemblyLign (International
Biotechnologies, Inc.) The program Mac Vector version 4.0 (International
