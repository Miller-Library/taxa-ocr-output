Results
cDNA concentrations as determined by UV spectrophotometry, ranged
from 180 ng/ol to 600 ng/bl. PCR products of the expected 450 bp size were
obtained for blue marlin, hagfish, shark, amphioxus. The photograph of the
products from PCR detection of recombinants shown in Figure l indicates that
cloning was successful with blue marlin, shark, and amphioxus. A faint band at
approximately 670 bp (450 bp of clone plus 220 bp of poly linker) from the
hagfish products can be seen in lane 12, however, sequencing of this clone
determined that there was no insert. RyRl sequence was amplified from the
three other species. Since the Block lab had already sequenced blue marlin in
this region, the sequence obtained for blue marlin in this study was not used in
comparisons.
The nucleotide sequences of shark and amphioxus are given in Figure 2.
These are consensus sequences derived from the overlap of the forward and
reverse primed sequences of a clone. Clean sequence for two amphioxus clones,
Amphe and Amphl0, and three shark clones, Shark17, Shark 20 and Shark21
were obtained. However, only the sequences from Shark17, Amph6 and Amphlo
are shown in Figure 2 because consensus sequences could only be determined for
these clones. Amph6 was sequenced twice and the two consensus sequences
showed 98.1% identity. Comparisons with GENBANK showed that the
sequences with the exception of Shark2l were most likely RyRI (Mus
musculus). BLASTX results for Shark21 indicated that this clone was probably
Ryk3 (Homo sapien). However, since a consensus sequence could not be
completed for this clone, its sequence was not used in analysis.
An alignment of the translated sequences is given in Figure 3. Sequence
identity is greatest among blue marlin, amphioxus and fish RyRI sequences
