From examination of records like those in Fig. 5, it appears
that the most powerful jetting responses are those that involve the
coordinated ("adult-like") use of the giant and non-giant motor
pathways. Thus, contractions associated with small-unit activity
alone (Fig 5, cycles 1 and 2) are not as powerful as cycle 3, although
they are definitely stronger than the contraction due to a normal
breathing cycle (prior to frame zero in Fig. 5A). Finally, a
contraction due to the firing of a short-latency, embryonic-type
giant spike acting more or less alone (e.g., due to the pallial nerve
stimulation) is at best equal to the contraction due to small motor
axon activity alone. This can be seen by comparing behavioal data
from Fig. 4B with cycle 1 in Fig. 5 (filled symbols in Fig. 5A). Thus,
a giant axon spike does not necessarily lead to a marked increase in
jetting performance over that provided by the non-giant system. The
boosting effect of the giant axon only comes about when its
activation is properly timed in relation to the burst of non-giant
activity.
Differences in the level of behavioral performances achieved
in jetting cycles invoking coordinated discharge of giant and nonÂ¬
giant motor units and in those cycles generated by small activity
alone can also be more subtle than indicated by the data in Fig. 5.
Fig. 6 shows the time course of the mantle radius and the
corresponding stellar nerve recording of the same 4 day-old unfed
squid (as in Fig. 5) in response to a 30 V shock to the mouth. Again,
the motor discharge displays a combination of embryonic and adult
patterns: An embryonic, giant-type occurs at short latency before
the burst of small unit activity in the first cycle; small activity
