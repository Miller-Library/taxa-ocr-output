ganglion, the slow motor axons emerge, with the third-order giant
axons, in the stellar nerves and synapse on circular mantle muscles
that are slow to fatigue (Mackie 1990; Otis and Gilly 1990).
A major advantage of such a complicated system lies in the
the ability to use the two pathways separately or in concert. The
giant axons, with much larger diameters (280-718 um in Loligo
forbesi ) than the small axons (40-50 um), also have greater
conduction velocities (15.0-22.3 m/s vs 3.1-5.6 m/s) (Pumphrey and
Young 1938).
The two pathways can work together in a coordinated manner,
and two electrophysiological escape response patterns have been
identified, one for adults and one for embryos. The adult, or
delayed-type, pattern shows multiple cycles of small motor activity
at long latency (300-500 ms) with the giant spike(s) present, if
occurring at all, in the middle of bursts of small motor axon spikes
(Otis and Gilly, 1990). The embryonic, or fast-start, pattern
characteristically shows a single giant spike preceding any small
motor activity in the same cycle, and occurs at short latency (-50
ms) (Gilly et al. 1991). The embryonic pattern is retained by the
hatchling, and within a few weeks, the adult pattern develops. Ã„fter
the change to the adult pattern, the fast-start pattern of giant axon
firing is seen only following sudden visual stimulation (Otis and
Gilly, 1990).
The factors responsible for the progressive development from
one system to the other are currently unknown. However, one
function that may require the use of the adultlike motor patterns is
prey capturing. Sepioteuthis hatchlings develop the ability to feed
