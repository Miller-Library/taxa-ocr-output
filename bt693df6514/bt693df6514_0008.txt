obtaining an indication of the mantle response due to preferential
activation of the giant axon.
Recordings of mantle dynamics and the underlying motor
patterns in the stellar nerve were also obtained from a 4 day-old
restrained hatchling that had not been fed (Fig. 4). A 5 V shock to
the pallial nerve was delivered, and this resulted in a single, abrupt
jet response. Firing of the giant axon within one ms after the shock
(Fig. 4A) leads to the onset of mantle contraction within one frame
(Fig. 4B), and the mantle contraction reaches peak response (the
smallest diameter) by 2-3 frames. The rapid onset of this mantle
response and its temporal relationship to the giant spike are thus
very similar to the results discussed above in conjunction with
strobe flash stimuli. Pallial nerve stimulation appears to produce a
mantle reponse that is longer lasting than that due to a strobe
stimulation (compare Figs. 4B and 1A). However, this may be due to
secondary small unit activity that accurs with a sizeable delay only
after the nerve shock. Such late activity is apparent in Fig. 2A.
Shocks applied to the surface of the head of the same 4 day-
old squid give behavioral and neural responses that are more
complex than either pallial nerve shock or strobe stimulation. A
single 20 V shock to the mouth during frame zero results in the
behavioral data shown in Fig. 5A, and the corresponding stellar nerve
activity is shown in Fig. 5B. Expanded traces for each of the 3
jetting cycles are shown in Fig. 50. The short latency for the first
cycle of neural activity (30 ms) is characteristic of hatchling and
embryonic squid (Gilly et al, 1991) and is not seen with adult
animals (Otis and Gilly, 1990).
