only is present in the second cycle; the adultlike-coordinated
giant/non-giant discharge exists in cycles 3 and 4. In Fig. 6A, the
corresponding measurements of the mantle radius do not show
marked differences in speed or degree of contraction. However,
when the corresponding thrust of the water jet (calculated as
(dVol/dt)2, where volume is proportional to the mantle radiuse
(O'Dor, Foy, and Helm, 1986)) produced by each mantle contraction is
compared in Fig. 7, there is a notable correlation between the type
of motor activity and the strength of the jet thrust for each cycle:
the thrust produced by the embryonic giant (cycle 1) is on the same
order as, but slightly greater than, the thrust from the small motor
activity alone (cycle 2); adult-like cycles 3 and 4, where the giants
fall in the middle of small unit firing, are associated with jet
thrusts considerably larger than those of cycles 1 and 2.
DISCUSSION
The higher values of instantaneous velocity and acceleration
in the feeding hatchlings compared with the giant-only escape
response produced by a strobe flash seem to indicate that, in order
to produce the extra burst of speed, the giant and the small motor
systems must be working together to produce an added behavioral
effect. In this experiment, behavioral and electrophysiological work
on restrained hatchlings shows that the degree of mantle
contraction and jet thrust produced are related to the motor
patterns of escape response elicited by the hatchling.
In considering mantle radii, all escape responses produce
stronger contractions than those made during a normal breathing
