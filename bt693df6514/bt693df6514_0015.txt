FIGURE LEGEND
Figure 1A: Instantaneous velocity of an 11 day-old hatchling during
a feeding attack and during an escape to a strobe flash
Figure 1B: Acceleration of the feeding attack and escape to the
strobe
Figure 2A: Electrical recording of an 11 day old, "fed" hatchling in
response to a 5 V pallial nerve shock
Figure 2B: Same as 2A on an expanded timescale
Figure 3:
Electrical recording of the restrained, 11 day-old, "fed'
hatchling escape to a strobe flash
Figure 4A: Oscilliscope trace of a 5V shock to the pallial nerve of a
4 day-old unfed hatchling
Figure 4B: Corresponding mantle radius, before, during, and after the
shock (frame zero) described in Figure 44
Figure 5A: Mantle radius of 4 day, "unfed" hatchling before, during
and after a 20 V shock to the mouth at frame zero
Figure 5B:
Electrical recording of the hatchling's reaction to the
shock
Figure 50: Cycles 1, 2, and 3 from figure 5B shown on an expanded
timescale
Figure 6A: Mantle radius and electrical recording of same 4
day, "unfed" hatchling before, during, and after a 30 V
shock to the mouth at frame zero. This shock was given
approximately 1/2 hour after the shock corresponding
with Fig. 5
Figure 6B: Expanded timescale of cycles 1-4 in Figure 6A
Figure 7:
Calculated thrust of the water jet corresponding with Fig.
