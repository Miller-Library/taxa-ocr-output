ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Many thanks go to Professor Gilly, whose patience, advice,
wisdom, and humor were much appreciated; without his help this
project would never have been accomplished. I am also indebted to
the following people: Professor Baxter for providing the video
equipment, Roger Hanlon and the University of Texas for supplying
the squid eggs, Bruce Hopkins for advice and help with setting up
equipment for experiments, Professor Denny for his infinite
knowledge of energetics, and Professor Thompson, director of
Megavision Studios. I would also like to thank the 1991 Biology
175H dudes for their support and friendship.
