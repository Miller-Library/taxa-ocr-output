were either digitized and stored on a videotape or were stored on
the audio track of the behavioral videotape.
Calculations
In the videotapes of the free-swimming animal, the Megavision
system was used to collect the x,y coordinates of the eye in
sequential frames. The calculated distance that the squid's eye
moved in sequential frames was used to measure the instantaneous
velocity. Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity: dy/dt.
Experiments were normalized for comparison by dividing all values
of velocity and acceleration by the body length of the squid, which
was the average measured distance from the squid's eye to its tail
in the frames used for data collection.
Videotapes of the restrained animal were used to measure the
change in radius (r) of the mantle over sequential frames. Volume
(Vol) is proportional to r2 for a cylindrical or conical object. The
thrust of the water jet produced by the mantle contraction can be
calculated based on equations provided by Ö'Dor, Foy, and Helm
(1986), and is proportional to (dVol/dt)2.
