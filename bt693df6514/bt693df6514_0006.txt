experiment with an 11 day-old animal that had been actively
feeding, the maximum instantaneous velocity reliably occurred
between the between the second and third frame (33 ms per frame)
after the strobe flash and had a value ranging from 0.45-0.56 body
lengths/frame and corresponding accelerations of 0.37-0.44 body
legths/ framee. Examples of such responses are indicated by the
open symbols in Figs. 1A, B, respectively. Similar responses were
also obtained in younger squid (3-8 days; data not illustrated).
During an attack on a small fish, the same squid displayed a
maximum velocity of 1.1 body lengths/frame and a peak acceleration
of 0.57 body lengths/frame2. Thus, the feeding attack of a hatchling
squid can be substantially more rapid than an escape resoponse to a
strobe flash. Based on the published work on Loligo (Otis and Gilly,
1990; Gilly et al, 1991) and on the data on Sepioteuthis described
below, it is assumed that these escape responses are largely, or
entirely, diven by a single giant axon spike and that the small motor
axon system plays a negligible role. The significantly greater values
of both peak velocity and acceleration during the feeding episode
suggest that the giant axon may also be utilized during this nonÂ¬
escape behavior. In order to pursue this idea, the relationship
between motor activity and jetting performance was investigated in
restrained hatchlings.
Electrophysiological recordings in conjunction with behavior in the
restrained hatchling
Electrophysiological recordings in restrained animals have
shown that escape responses to strobe flashes give a distinctive
