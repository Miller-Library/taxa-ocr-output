ABSTRACT
Free-swimming Sepioteuthis lessoniana hatchlings were
videotaped during both feeding and strobe flash sessions. Analysis
showed that while feeding the peak instantaneous velocity obtained
by the hatchling is twice as great and the peak acceleration is 50%
greater than during an escape response to a strobe flash in which
only the giant axon is used. Behavioral measurements of mantle
radius made with video were used to compute jet thrust and compare
performance with varying patterns of motor neuron activity in the
restrained hatchling. The coordinated, adultlike pattern of giant and
small fiber use resulted in mantle contractions and jet thrusts that
were always greater than contractions and thrusts produced by
giant-only or small-only responses. Thus, evidence strongly
suggests that hatchling Sepioteuthis use the giant fiber in feeding
attacks.
INTRODUCTION
The squid neural system is comprised of two motor pathways,
one slow and one fast, that can interact in complex ways. The fast
pathway originates in the brain from two first order giant cells
which make contact with seven second order giant neuons. One
second-order axon projects to the stellate ganglion and synapses
there with the third order giant axons that innervate mantle muscles
associated with rapid escape responses. The slow pathway runs
basically in parallel, starting from the median basal lobe of the
brain, connecting with the pallio-visceral lobe, and then continuing
on to the stellate ganglion via the pallial nerve. From the stellate
