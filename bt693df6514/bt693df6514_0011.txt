cycle. Small motor activity can produce a contraction as strong, if
not stronger than the giant acting alone (overlay, Figure 5A). Small
motor activity also gives weaker contractions than when both the
small and the giant systems are being used in conjunction (Figures
5A and 6A). While Figure 6A shows that the contraction caused by
small activity only is almost equivalent to other cycles in which the
giants are involved, it is worth noting that the lowest point in cycle
2 is indicated by a single point, whereas the other cycles have
multiple points defining the full contraction. The difference in the
position of this low point and the points clustered at a higher level
in this contraction could easily be due to noise in sampling
measurements.
While embryonic and adultlike giant spikes show almost no
difference in the degree of mantle contraction, the effect of each
response pattern is made apparent when jet thrust is calculated.
The jet thrust resulting from the embryonic giant is only about half
of the thrust produced by a single adultlike giant spike. Thus, the
presence of a giant acting with small motor activity does not
necessarily imply that an added behavioral effect will be produced.
Instead, the position of the giant spike seems to be the factor that
determines if the effects from the giant and the small systems will
add or not: a giant fired at long latency, in the middle of a burst of
small motor activity will give a summed effect, while a short
latency giant that preceeds small motor activity produces behavior
that is similar to small motor activity acting alone. Also, the
summed effect of the adultlike pattern of giant fiber use
consistently produces mantle contractions that are larger than that
