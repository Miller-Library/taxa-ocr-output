of the giant alone or the small fiber alone. This would seem to
indicate that, in order to attain the high velocity and acceleration
seen in feeding, the hatchlings must be using the giant in an
adultlike manner.
The effect of feeding vs. not feeding on the degree of mantle
contraction and jet thrust is yet to be determined. Both fed and
unfed squid showed combinations of the adult and embryonic
patterns at the age of 4 days. If animals were in the "fed" category,
the adultlike response would predominate by the age of 8 days; if
"unfed", the hatchling exhibited only embryonic behavior by as early
as 6 days old, though they did not survive or were not kept alive
beyond 7 days. This might indicate that adultlike-use of the giant
fiber must be exercised through an activity such as feeding,
otherwise the ability to use the adult pattern is lost once the
hatchling is past 4-5 days old. This also supports the idea that the
giant fiber is used in an adultlike manner for feeding.
Future work may focus on obtaining more video data on
hatchling feeding. Due to the difficulty in videotaping the feeding
attacks of the Sepioteuthis hatchlings, only a small number of
sequences were of use for analysis. The feeding attack/capture
sequence of an 11 day-old Sepioteuthis hatchling seemed to be
representative of the feeding attacks made by other 7-8 day-old
hatchlings, but this is not certain. At the present time, electrical
recordings from free-swimming hatchlings are not possible.
Therefore, in order to assess whether the adultlike giant is actually
being used in feeding, the behavioral data from the restrained
animals must be converted to values of free-swimming acceleration
