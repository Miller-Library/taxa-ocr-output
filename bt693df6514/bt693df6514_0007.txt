motor discharge in the stellar nerves in both adult, hatchling, and
late-stage embryonic Loligo opalescens (Otis and Gilly, 1990; Gilly
et al, 1991). In "simple" escape responses of this type, the giant
axon fires first at brief latency (25-50 ms) and may be followed by
small unit activity of unidentified origin. Firing of the giant is
always accompanied by a sudden jetting reaction. When the giant
does not fire in response to the strobe stimulus, no mantle response
is detectable with video observations, even though some small
motor activity may occur. Sepioteuthis lessoniana hatchlings
displayed similar behavior in the present study.
Just supra-threshold electrical stimulation of the pallial
nerve in a restrained 11 day-old squid (same animal as in behavioral
experiment of Fig. 1) results in the fairly selective firing of the
giant fiber with a delay of approximately 1 ms, as shown in Fig. 2. A
strobe flash stimulus (Fig. 3) also triggers a giant axon spike but at
a longer delay (20 ms). The recordings in both Figs. 2 and 3 also
show some small unit activity of uncertain origin following the
giant spike. If strobe stimulation fails to trigger a giant spike,
there is no observable mantle response. In the case of pallial nerve
stimulation, proper positioning of the stimulating electrode can
yield a similar pattern, but often weak mantle responses
(determined by simple visual observation) can be elicited without
activation of the giant axons. In either case, pallial nerve
stimulation was a reliable means of providing a "template" for the
waveform and amplitude of the giant spike to aid in its
identification during more complex motor discharges and in
