on live prey as early as 4 days posthatching (Hanlon, 1990), and
precise timing of a strike would be advantageous in capturing a
rapidly moving prey item, such as a copepod or larval fish. Thus, it
is of interest to compare in more detail the time course of evolution
of the adult-like useage of the giant fiber system with the
development of feeding behavior. Additionally, it is possible that
the attacks made on live prey may positively reinforce the adult
pattern of giant fiber utilization or even be necessary for the
changeover. As a first step in exploring these ideas, it must be
ascertained whether or not the giant axons are used in feeding by
hatchling squid.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Late-stage Sepioteuthis lessoniana eggs were obtained from
the Marine Biomedical Institute, University of Texas Medical Branch,
Galveston, and kept in circular plastic tubs (28 cm in diameter, 15
cm deep) in an aquatron (100 gallon tank with 50 gallon reserve)
with gently circulating seawater (22-23 Â°0). The tubs had two
Nytex (0.4 x 0.4 mm pores) panels in the sides and one in the bottom
to keep water circulating in the tubs. Each morning, hatchlings born
overnight were put in one group and transferred by beaker to either
another plastic tub or the open aquatron, so that animals of
different ages were separated from each other. Groups of animals
were arbitrarily chosen to be "fed" or "unfed". Fed animals were
kept in the open portion of the aquatron and were given many small
