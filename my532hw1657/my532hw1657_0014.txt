Acknowledgements
1 thank Professor Gilly for his guidance, encouragement, and Conus californicus
specimens. I would also like to thank him for allowing me to have unlimited access to
his lab over the past few months. I want to give an extra special thanks to Joseph Schulz
for showing me these biochemical techniques and for his never-ending help and patience
throughout the quarter. I would also like to acknowledge all of the members of Gilly's
lab for answering my numerous questions. Finally, I want to thank Chris Patton for
helping me produce the SEM images of the granules.
