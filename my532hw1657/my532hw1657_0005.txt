SDS-PAGE Gels
Gels were set up using the Bio-Rad Mini Protean II Electrophoresis gel system.
Samples were dissolved in 2X Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 95Â°C for 6 minutes.
Gels were run with 16mA/gel for approximately 1.5 hours or until the dye front reached
the end of the gel. 10% and 5% SDS-PAGE gels were only run for samples from the
sucrose gradient.
Tricine SDS-PAGE Gels
As described by Judd in the Protein Protocol's Handbook, the separating gel was
composed of 1.34 ml water, 2 ml separating gel buffer, 2 ml of IX crosslinker
separating/spacer gel acrylamide, 640 uL glycerol, 2 uL TEMED, and 100 uL 10%
ammonium persulfate. The recipe for the spacer gel was 1.38 ml water, 1 ml
separating/spacer gel buffer, 0.6 ml IX crosslinker separating/spacer gel acrylamide, 1
uL TEMED, and 10 uL 10% ammonium persulfate. The stacking gel recipe was
composed of 2.06 ml water, 0.38 ml 1.OM Tris buffer, 0.5 ml stacking gel acrylamide, 12
uL O.SM EDTA, 1.5 uL TEMED, and 30 uL 10% ammonium persulfate. Samples were
dissolved in 2X sample buffer and heated to 95'C for 6 minutes. 1OX cathode running
buffer was made of IM Trizma base, IM tricine, and 1% SDS and had a pH of 8.25. The
1OX stock of anode buffer was composed of 2M Trizma base with a pH of 8.9. Tricine
gels were run with 16mA/gel for approximately 3 hours when the dye front reached the
end of the gel.
