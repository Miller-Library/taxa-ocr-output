to the complicated material in the Ficoll-sucrose gradient pellet, the second band layer
contains only a few components (lane 5 in Fig. 7). If the "granule" contents from the thin
band layer are biologically active, they may supply an excellent source of purified Conus
peptide.
As shown in Figure 10D, the novel C. californicus peptide selectively blocks fast-
inactivating Na current in disassociated cells from the stellate ganglion of Sepia
officinalis. (Based on unpublished data by Gilly). Preliminary whole-cell voltage clamp
experiments suggest that the granule contents block both fast- and slower- inactivating
Na currents. Although little work has been done to investigate the novel peptide's
ability to block inactivating inward current, it appears that the granule contents contain
the novel peptide in some form. For example, the granules may possess an unmodified,
less discriminating form of the novel peptide that blocks various types of inactivating Na
channels. A concern about these experiments is that it was difficult to discern the exact
peptide concentrations in duct venom and the granule contents. An estimation was made
by assessing the different volumes of the Ficoll gradient layers obtained from a known
amount of duct venom. These physiology experiments suggest that duct venom and
granule contents reduce the current amplitude to different degrees. (Fig. 10A,B) A
discrepancy in concentrations of the peptide toxin may cause this effect. In order to
confirm the results of these experiments, further physiology experiments need to be
conducted after verification of peptide concentrations within each sample. Future
experiments should also explore the kinetics of the channels affected by these peptide
toxins.
