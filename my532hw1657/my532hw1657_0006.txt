Staining the Gels
SDS polyacrylamide gels were silver stained according to Morrissey (1981). Gels
were prefixed for approximately 1 day in 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid
followed by 5% methanol and 7% glacial acetic acid for 30 minutes. Gels were then
fixed in 10% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes and then soaked in water for over 1 hour.
This was followed by soaking the gels for 30 minutes in 5ug/ml dithiothreitol and then 30
minutes in 0.1% silver nitrate. The gels were developed in 50 uL of 37% formaldehyde
in 100 ml 3% NacOz. Staining was terminated by adding 1% glacial acetic acid. Gentle
agitation occurred during each of the above steps. Gels were stored in 0.03% NacO,
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Granules were fixed in 2% EM-grade glutaraldehyde in seawater. Dehydration
occurred through a graded series of 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol
concentrations. Approximately 1 ml of hexamethyldisalizane was added to dry the
granules. The granule samples were then mounted on carbon tape and sputter coated
with gold. Images were taken with a Hitachi S-450 Scanning Electron Microscope
operating at 15 KV.
Verification of Release of Granule Contents
A lul sample of the Ficoll gradient granules was heated for 5 minutes at 95'C.
Unheated and heated lul granule samples were observed with oil emersion lightÂ¬
microscopy at 60X.
