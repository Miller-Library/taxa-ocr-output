such as the thick band weighing less than 1.4 kDa, were not present in the Ficoll gradient
pellet (lane 5). The tricine gel in Figure 7 compared the bands from the different Ficoll
gradient layers as described in Figure 2. Unfortunately, Figure 7 does not adequately
represent these results because this gel did not run uniformly. As a result, it is difficult to
match the molecular weight standard bands (lane 1) directly to the bands in the other
lanes without considering the entire gel. Careful inspection of this tricine gel showed a 5
kDa band present in the Ficoll gradient pellet (lane 3), the whole duct venom (lane 2),
and in the white band (lane 5) from the Ficoll gradient. The 5 kDa band did not appear in
the middle layer (lane 4) or top layer of the Ficoll gradient (lane 6). Molecular weights
were calculated (Fig. 8) from the distances the bands traveled in the IX tricine gel shown
in Figure 7.
Solubilization of Granules in NP40
After centrifugation of the granule pellet from the sucrose gradient in non-ionic
detergent, the NP40 pellet still showed a strong band of 5 kDa (lane 3 in Fig. 9). There
was also a less prominent band of 5 kDa in the NP40 supernatant (lane 4). Except for the
5 kDa band, it appeared that most of the bands were different in the NP40 supernatant
and pellet. Combining the bands from NP40 pellet and NP40 supernatant produced the
original granule pellet bands from the sucrose gradient (Fig. 2), which did not resolve
well in the figure. The solubilized Ficoll gradient pellet produced similar results.
However, the bands were much lighter and difficult to scan onto a computer.
