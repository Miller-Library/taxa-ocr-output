In conclusion, the results from the biochemical and physiological experiments
suggest that the granules contain a putative Na channel-blocking peptide, which is a
component of both duct and milked venom. Thus, the venom duct granules may provide
a significant, but overlooked, source of potent peptide neurotoxins. This research
focused on identifying the 5 kDa peptide in the granules. However, the granules contain
numerous other components, which need further analysis. Additional research might also
focus on why the peptides must be enclosed within a tightly associated complex that is
not soluble in non-ionic detergent. Overall, this study is just the first step in
understanding the contents and function of the Conus duct venom granules.
