in seawater. The bottom layer was made from 1 M sucrose in seawater. The duct venom
pellet was resuspended and added to the top of the gradient. The gradient was then spun
at 100,000x g at 4 C for 45 minutes. Each layer was removed at stored at 4 C. All
natural seawater was buffered with Hepes and had a pH of 7 to 8.
Granule Isolation using Ficoll-Sucrose Discontinuous Velocity Sedimentation
The Ficoll-sucrose gradient was a modification of the protocol described by R.S.
Cameron and J.D. Castle (1984). The gradient was prepared in a 2 ml ultracentrifuge
tube. (Fig.2) The top layer consisted of 0.2 ml of 0.8 M sucrose in seawater. A second
layer of 0.5ml of 1.58 M sucrose in seawater followed this. The next layer was
composed of 0.75 ml of 1.55M sucrose and 4% Ficoll in seawater. A final layer was
prepared with 0.5 ml of 2M sucrose and 4% Ficoll in seawater. The resuspended duct
venom pellet was added to the gradient and spun at 100,000x g for 45 minutes. Each
layer was subsequently removed. The Ficoll pellet was resuspended in 0.4 ml of
seawater and spun in the microfuge for 15 minutes. The Ficoll pellet was then
resuspended in a final volume of 30 uL. Seawater was Hepes buffered and possessed a
pH of 7.8. All samples were frozen at -80'C.
Solubilization of Granules in NP40
Granule samples from the sucrose gradient or the Ficoll-sucrose gradient were
solubilized for twenty minutes in 1% Nonidet P40 in seawater. The samples were then
microcentrifuged to produce two layers, which were subsequently separated and stored at
â€”4 C.
