Abstract
Marine Conus snails produce a wide variety of neurotoxins ("conotoxins") that
specifically bind to different ion channels and neuronal receptors. Much research has
revolved around the physiological effects of the conotoxins without focus on how these
snails produce their venom. For example, the temperate snail Conus californicus
produces a novel conotoxin that targets voltage-sensitive sodium channels in cephalopod,
but not gastropod neurons. The predicted molecular weight from the CDNA sequence
encoding this peptide is 4680 Da. Numerous dense granules are present in the venom
duct of Conus californicus, where venom production occurs. In an attempt to isolate the
granules, as a first step towards biochemical characterization, crude venom was run on a
Ficoll-sucrose gradient. Inspection of these granules with light microscopy and scanning
electron microscopy confirmed the presence of dense granules of approximately 2-6 um
in diameter. Electrophoresis of the SDS solubilized granules revealed a prominent 5 kDa
band on SDS-polyacrylamide tricine gels that matches a band in "milked" venom and
duct venom. This 5 kDa granule peptide was not solubilized by nonionic detergent
(NP40) suggesting that it is packed within a tightly associated granule complex.
Observation with light microscopy indicated that application of heat disintegrated the
granules and released soluble, bio-active peptide into the medium. Preliminary whole
cell voltage-clamp recordings of disassociated cells from the stellate ganglion of Sepia
officinalis showed that the granule contents block voltage-gated sodium channels. In
conclusion, it appears that these dense granules contain a peptide resembling mature
milked venom peptide in both mass and function.
