a Ficoll-sucrose discontinuous gradient was employed since it possessed additional dense
layers. Only very heavy duct venom components, such as dense granules, could possibly
make their way to the very bottom of the Ficoll-sucrose gradient. This granule
purification process appeared more efficient because it eliminated excess bands found in
the lanes containing the sucrose gradient pellet.
Because each gel varied slightly in shape and how the samples ran, it was difficult
to align the bands without surveying the entire gel. Results indicate that the granules
possess a peptide with a molecular weight of approximately 5 kDa, which corresponds to
the predicted molecular weight from the novel C. californicus peptideâ€™s CDNA sequence
of 4680 Da. However, there is a discrepancy in the exact molecular weight of the C.
californicus novel peptide. Mass spectroscopy suggests that the novel peptide is 3120
Da. Possible ionization or fragmentation problems with the mass spectroscopy may have
caused the lower molecular weight results. Unfortunately, this novel peptide was not run
on a gel so it is not possible to directly compare bands. Another concern is that Conus
venoms change while the animal remains in captivity and this may cause variances in
molecular weight predictions. Overall, the tricine gels indicted that the granules contain
a prominent peptide of approximately 5 kDa, which matches a band in whole duct venom
and in milked venom.
The 5 kDa band is also present in the thin, second layer from the Ficoll-sucrose
discontinuous gradient (Fig. 2B). Visual inspection with light microscopy revealed
minute, round bodies in this thin layer. These two clues suggest that this layer contains
tiny granules. Physiological experiments were not performed with this material and it is
unknown if the peptides from these "granules" contain active peptide toxins. In contrast
