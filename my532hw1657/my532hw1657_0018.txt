Fig.6 SDS-Polyacrylamide tricine gel comparing results from the sucrose and Ficoll-
sucrose discontinuent gradients. Both arrows denote the 5 kDa band. The gel
curved down towards the right, so the 5 kDa band appears lower on the right side
of the gel than on the left side. The 5 kDa band is present in lanes 2-5, 9, and 10.

fractions from the Ficoll-sucrose discontinuous gradient. The arrow denotes the
5 kDa band, which appears in lanes 2,3, and 5. Once again, the gel was curved
inward and it is difficult to compare bands to the molecular weight standard
without assessing the entire gel.

Fig.8
SDS-Polyacrylamide tricine gel shown in Figure 7. This graph was used to
compute the molecular weight of the granule band as 5 kDa.

Tricine gel comparing the NP40 soluble and insoluble material within the pellet
from the sucrose gradient. The arrow highlights the 5 kDa band.
Fig. 10A Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of disassociated cells from the stellate
ganglion of Sepia officinalis. Shows the effects of 1:100 and 1:500 dilutions of
Conus californicus whole duct venom on inactivating inward current. Voltage
step and pulse durations are listed at the bottom.
Fig. IOB This second trace illustrates the similar effects of 1:100 and 1:500 dilutions of
the granule contents on inactivating inward current.
Fig. 10C Recording demonstrating the effects of the 1:500 dilution of the granule contents
on fast-inactivating inward current. Voltage step and pulse duration listed below
the trace.
Fig. 10D Recording illustrating the effects of the putative novel peptide from C.
californicus on fast-inactivating inward current. Recording based on work by
Wm. F. Gilly.
