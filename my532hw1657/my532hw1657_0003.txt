Production of Conus venom occurs in four general steps: precursor synthesis,
processing, packaging, and venom delivery. (Maguire and Kwan, 1992) The first three
steps occur within the venom duct of the Conus snail. Visual inspection of the venom
duct shows that it contains numerous dense granules of various sizes. However, the
purpose of the granules remains a mystery. The granules may be involved in packaging
of immature venom, synthesis of venom to a certain phase, transportation of mature
venom to the radular teeth, or even transport of enzymes necessary for venom production.
In order to ascertain the function of the granules, the first step is to identify their contents.
The purpose of this research was to perform a biochemical analysis of the Conus
californicus granules in order to determine if the granules contain material similar to
mature venom peptides in either duct derived or milked venom.
Materials and Methods
Dissections
Conus californicus were obtained from the Monterey Bay and kept in tanks.
Specimens were anaesthetized in 2% magnesium chloride in seawater before dissections.
The venom duct and venom bulb were removed and the crude duct venom was squeezed
out. Samples were microcentrifuged for 15 minutes at 14,000 x g, and supernatant was
removed. (Fig. 1) The pellet was resuspended in a small quantity of seawater. Samples
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Granule Isolation using Sucrose Discontinuous Velocity Sedimentation
The gradient was set inside a 2 ml ultracentrifuge tube. The top layer was
composed of 0.5 ml of seawater. The second layer consisted of 0.5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose
