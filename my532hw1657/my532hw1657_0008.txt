SDS PAGE Gel Results of Sucrose Discontinuous Velocity Sedimentation
Centrifugation of the sucrose gradient produced a supernatant of mixed sucrose
layers and a pellet. During an initial attempt to analyze the results of the sucrose
discontinuous gradient, 10% and 5% SDS PAGE gels were run. As shown in Figure 5.
all duct venom components were very complicated and many bands of similar molecular
weights appeared in lanes 2-6. The material from the sucrose gradient's supernatant (lane
2) appeared to be composed of similar material as the supernatant from the whole duct
venom of C. californicus (lane 3). For example, both lanes 2 and 3 possessed a
prominent band at approximately 25 kDa and a 49 kDa band. However, taking the
unbalanced sample loads into consideration, both bands also appeared in the sucrose
gradient's "granule" pellet (lane 4), whole duct venom (lane 5), and duct venom pellet
(lane 6) as well. Overall, it appeared that the majority of the bands in the sucrose
gradient pellet were also present in the gradient's supernatant.
The tricine gel (Fig. 6) showed a prominent 5 kDa band in the "granule" pellet
from the sucrose gradient. Lane 4 from Figure 6 shows this 5 kDa band, which matches a
band of the same molecular weight in the whole duct venom (lanes 3 & 9) and in
milked" venom from C. californicus (lane 10). This 5 kDa band did not appear in the
supernatant from the sucrose gradient (lane 8).
SDS PAGE Tricine Gel Results of Ficoll-Sucrose Discontinuent Velocity Sedimentation
Ultracentrifugation resulted in a top layer, a thin white band, a middle layer, and a
pellet. (Fig. 2B) The tricine gel (Fig. 6) produced a prominent 5 kDa band from the
Ficoll gradient pellet (lane 5) that matched the sucrose gradient pellet band (lane 4) in
both weight and intensity. Many of the bands from the sucrose gradient pellet (lane 4),
