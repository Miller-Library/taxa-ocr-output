Introduction
Lurking within the waters of Monterey Bay, Conus californicus utilizes an
assortment of peptide toxins to catch its prey of polychaetes, snails, a small species of
octopus, and small fish. Conus californicus is just one of an estimated 500 Conus species
that produces â€œconotoxins" to capture prey. Conotoxins are produced in the venom duct
of the Conus snail and stored in modified radular teeth. The predatory snail harpoons its
victims with a barbed tooth and injects up to 30 ul of venom. (Bingham, et. al. 1996)
Different Conus species have evolved neurotoxins, which specialize in swiftly
immobilizing their prey. (Duda and Palumbi 1999) These peptide toxins are now valued
for their potential medicinal role in targeting specific families of ion channels and
neuronal receptors.
The peptide toxins of the Conus snails are generally 10-30 amino acids long.
(Ramilo et. al. 1992) Some of the conotoxin families include o-conotoxin that targets
voltage-sensitive calcium channels and a-conotoxin that affects nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors. This research examines a novel family of conotoxin from the "milked" venom
of Conus californicus, which is structurally unrelated to previously classified Conus
peptides. This novel conotoxin has a predicted molecular weight of 4680 Da from its
CDNA sequence and selectively targets voltage-sensitive sodium channels in cephalopod,
but not gastropod neurons. (Based on unpublished data by Joseph Schulz) Although the
physiological effects of these various conotoxin families have been examined
extensively, little research has been devoted towards understanding how the Conus snails
produce their complex venoms.
