Whole Voltage-Clamp Recordings
After applying heat to the Ficoll-sucrose gradient pellet, there were very few
intact granules present compared to the control. For example, within a minuteâ€™s limit an
average of 11 intact granules were counted in the control slide and only 3-4 granules
were found in the heated sample. Most of the heated granules appeared broken up and
there was more free material present in the background.
Preliminary whole cell voltage-clamp recordings demonstrated that whole duct
venom from Conus californicus blocked inactivating Na current. (Fig. 10A) A 1:500
dilution of duct venom partially blocked inward Na- current, and a 1:100 dilution
appeared to nearly eliminate inactivating Na current. A 1:500 dilution of granule
contents had little effect on inactivating Na current, but a 1:100 dilution blocked
approximately 1/2 of the inward Na current. (Fig. 10B) In contrast, a 1:500 dilution of
the granule contents blocked fast-inactivating inward current. (Fig. 10C) Both the duct
venom and the granule contents were less effective on the non-inactivating, inward tail
currents. These latter currents are carried primarily by Ca.
Discussion
Much time was devoted towards developing an adequate method of purifying the
granules from the duct venom. An initial attempt was made using a sucrose
discontinuous gradient. However, massive components, such as epithelial cells
inadvertently obtained from the dissection process, appeared to contaminate the granule
pellet. In an attempt to further separate these undesirable components from the granules,
