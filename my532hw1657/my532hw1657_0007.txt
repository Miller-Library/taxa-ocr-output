Whole Cell Voltage-Clamp Recordings
Whole cell voltage-clamp was performed on disassociated cells from the stellate
ganglion of Sepia officinalis. The external recording solution was composed of 480 ml
Nacl, 10 ml CaCh, 20 ml MgCl, 20 ml MgSO4, and 10 ml Hepes at a pH of 8.0. The
supernatant from the duct venom was composed of 3 C. californicus specimens in 0.4 ml
of seawater. The duct venom supernatant was heated for 5 minutes at 95Â°C. 1/100 and
1/500 dilutions of duct venom supernatant were applied to the cells. In order to release
the granule contents, the granules from the Ficoll gradient pellet were also heated at 95'C
for 5 minutes. A 1/500 or 1/100 dilution of the Ficoll pellet was applied to disassociated
cells from the stellate ganglion. All recordings were done at 12-13'C using custom
software.
Results
Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy
The contents of the Ficoll-sucrose pellet were observed with a light microscope as
shown in Figure 3. The granules appeared abundant, dense, and varied in size. They
generally clumped together as exemplified by Fig. 3B. SEM images also revealed dense
granules ranging from 2-6um in diameter. (Figs. 4A,B,C, & D) Most of the granules had a
convoluted surface structure (Figs. 4A, B, and C), which is probably due to the
dehydration process. Only two out of approximately 100 granules appeared non-
shrunken. (Fig. 4D)
