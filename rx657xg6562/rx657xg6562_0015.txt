unsulfated and has no effect in inhibiting fertilization. Heparin and ZA are
similar in that they both significantly suppppress fertiliation and contain
sulfate groups. There is evidence from the work of DeAngelis and Glabe
(1987), that the egg surface ligands for bindin, a protein secreted from the
acrosomal granule of sea urchin sperm that mediates the spermâ€™s adhesion to
the egg, have been characterized as containing substantial amounts of
carbohydrate and esterified sulfate. Because zosteric acid is a sulphated
phenolic ester, it may be suppressing fertilization because it is similiar in
structure to the egg surface ligands, thereby tying up sperm and preventing
them from fertilizing.
The Protease treatment experiment further elucidated the mechanism
by which ZA inhibits fertilization. By removing the vitelline layer of the eggs
with Protease, the egg receptors for the sperm were also removed. Figure 6
shows that ZA inhibits fertilization by up to 83.0% when using eggs with
intact vitelline layers. It also showed that ZA lost its inhibitory effect on
fertilization once the vitelline layer was removed. These results suggest that
ZA inhibits fertilization by binding to the egg receptors on the vitelline layer.
Once the vitelline layer is removed, the ZA can no longer bind to the egg
receptors located on this layer and therefore can no longer shield it from
sperm. The sperm can then freely swim to the plasma membrane, where
other egg receptors may also be located, and fertilize. This assay therefore
suggests that the vitelline layer and the receptors on it may be the critical
components affected by ZA in the inhibition of fertilization.
CONCLUSION
The experiments conducted in this study show that zosteric acid
produces a wide variety of effects: on barnacle behavior and settlement,
