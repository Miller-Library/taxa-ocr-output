INTRODUCTION
Biofouling, the attachment of a wide variety of organisms to Ã 
submerged surface, has been and continues to be a major economic concern.
Both microscopic and macroscopic organisms contribute substantially to drag
and the loss of integrity of ships and other vessels. In the past, the most
effective antifouling compounds have been toxic to marine life prompting
continued research in this area.
The recent identification and synthesis of p-(sulphooxy) cinnamic acid,
commonly known as zosteric acid (ZA), by Dr. Richard Zimmerman is one of
the first natural non-toxic compounds shown to prevent fouling of a wide
range of organisms (Todd, Zimmerman, Crews, and Alberte, 1993). This work
was inspired by the observation that new leaves of Zostera marina, from
which the compound was isolated, were essentially free of fouling organisms
from marine bacteria to barnacles (Harrison, P.G., 1982).
The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism(s) by
which zosteric acid inhibits fouling. The most prevalent form of fouling is
barnacle settlement (Christie, A.O. and Dalley, R., 1987). Therefore, three
Balanus amphitrite bioassays analyzing the effects of ZA on larval
chemotaxis, mobility, and settlement were performed to determine the
compound's mode of action of ZA. The effects of ZA on marine bacteria
were also studied because the presence of microbial films was shown to act as
a settlement cue in recruiting cypris larvae to surfaces (Maki et al., 1990)
Cypris larvae respond to surface associated stimuli during settlement and
metamorphosis. Attached bacteria can present various stimuli by changing
the surface chemistry through their physical presence and or by the
production of extracellular molecules. Therefore, by preventing the
formation of bacterial films, the primary initiator of fouling that leads to the
