successive growth of both algae and marine invertebrates, ZA may inhibit
barnacle settlement.
Zosteric acid was also tested in another type of attachment assay, the
attachment of the sperm to the egg in the fertilization of sea urchins.
Gametes from both Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Litichinus pictus were
used to determine the mode of action of ZA as a possible inhibitor of
attachment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The competent cyprids of Balanus amphitrite used in this study were
cultured by James S. Todd at the Marine Sciences Laboratory of Duke
University according to the method described in Rittschof, D., 1992.
Chemotaxis Assay
Chemotactic response was assayed using a 50 cm long trough of PVC
pipe. Barnacle larvae were maintained at a temperature of 6-8Â° C to prevent
settlement and kept at room temperature during the experiment. Both ends
were closed with silicone gel and rubber stoppers were used to prevent water
flow between the five 10 cm sections. To begin, a rubber stopper was placed at
20 and 30 cm from side #1 and from approximately 250 barnacle larvae were
pipetted along with 8 ml of FSW into this section of the trough. 14 ml of
FSW were then added to the 0-20 cm section and 16 ml to the 30-50 cm
section. At time zero 2 ml of 30 mM ZA were added at 0 cm and the two
rubber stoppers removed allowing the movement of the cyprids and the
diffusion of ZA throughout the trough. At 60 minutes, a rubber stopper was
placed at each 10 cm mark from side f1 (10 cm, 20 cm,...) and the number of
larvae in each of the five 10 cm sections were counted (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm....).
Experiments were disregarded if the number of larvae was less than 100 or if
