dishes and examined under the microscope. The number of fertilized and
unfertilized eggs were recorded to compare percent fertilization at the varying
concentrations of the two compounds. These dose response experiments for
ZA and CA were done twice with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and also
once with Litichinus pictus for ZA.
A comparative analysis was done with Litichinus pictus and ZA, CA,
and Heparin, to compare the effects on fertilization of a known compound
such as Heparin with the compounds under study. All dishes were set up in
replicates. Controls were set up with sperm (diluted 1/100,000), eggs (2%
solution in FSW), and FSW for a final volume of 5 ml. The experimental
dishes were set up similiarly except that they contained a final concentration
of 3mM ZA, CA, or Heparin. Once the gametes were allowed to fertilize,
samples were removed from the dishes and examined. The number of
fertilized and unfertilized eggs were recorded to compare the variability in
percent fertilization due to the effects of the different compounds.
One last fertilization experiment was done to determine the
mechanism by which zosteric acid inhibits fertilization. A protease was used
to remove the vitelline layer of the unfertilized eggs to determine whether or
not ZA was inhibiting fertilization by acting on the egg, as opposed to the
sperm. In the control dishes, untreated eggs with intact vitelline layers were
placed in 0 mM, 1mM, and 3 mM concentrations of ZA. The experimental
dishes contained ZA at the same concentrations mentioned above with eg
whose vitelline layers were removed. The vitelline layer of the eggs were
removed by treating dejellied eggs with Protease (100 ug/1 ml egg solution)
for 10 minutes. The eggs were then washed three times to remove excess
Protease. Sperm (1/10,000 dilution) were added to the untreated and treated
eggs. After four hours samples were removed and percent fertilization was
