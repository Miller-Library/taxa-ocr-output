cells, and 3mM zosteric acid showed agglutinated red blood cells with bacteria
attached, just as in the positive control.
The second assay showed a difference in the density of bacteria attached
to the glass slides in response to the varying concentrations of zosteric acid in
solution. Bacteria were counted from the photographs taken of the glass
slides immediately after they were washed of excess unattached bacteria in
SW. These numbers were then normalized to the control. Figure 3 shows a
negative correlation between the concentration of zosteric acid and bacterial
density. The lower concentrations (0.03 mM and 0.3 mM) of the zosteric acid
seemed to have a small, yet noticeable effect on the density of attached
bacteria by 18.2% and 24.3% respectively. The highest concentration of
zosteric acid (3 mM) had a more significant effect in preventing bacterial
attachment, decreasing the density of attached barnacles by 36.4%.
Sea Urchin Fertilization
In the dose response experiments with the Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus, ZA decreased percent fertilization while CA did not. The mean
fertilization rates for each concentration were normalized to the percentage of
the control and plotted in Figure 4. The figure shows a negative correlation
between the concentration of ZA and percent fertilization. The data at 2 mM,
3 mM, and 4 mM ZA dishes were statistically different from the control,
having P values of 0.023, 0.006, and 0.00 respectively. The dose response
experiment for ZA on Litichinus pictus showed a similiar negative
correlation between increasing concentrations of ZA and percent fertilization.
Figure 4 also shows the relationship between CA and fertilization in S.
purpuratus. Increasing concentrations of CA have no statistically different
effect on the percentage of eggs fertilized (P value: 0.147) as compared to the
control.
