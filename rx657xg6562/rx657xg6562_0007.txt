containing 200 ul of three marine bacterial isolates of the strain Shewanella.
The control tube contained 600 ul of the bacterial strains and SSW, for a total
volume of 30 ml. The four experimental tubes contained bacteria, and three
different concentrations of pH neutralized zosteric acid (0.03mM, O.3mM,
3.OmM) or coumaric acid (3.0 mM), and the appropriate amount of SSW for a
final volume of 30 ml each. A glass slide was then placed in each tube such
that it would float horizontally once the tubes were placed on their sides. The
tubes were placed on a rocker at room temperature for two hours. Each glass
slide was removed and dipped in SSW three times to remove much of the
excess unattached bacteria. The underside of each slide was examined to
ensure that the bacteria were specifically attaching themselves as opposed to
settling due to gravity. The slides were then examined and photographed
under the microscope. The number of bacteria per unit area was counted to
quantify the density of the bacteria attached to the surface of the slide.
Sea Urchin Fertilization
Several experiments were done to determine the effects of zosteric acid
on sea urchin fertilization and the possible mechanism by which it functions.
A dose response experiment for both ZA and CA was performed with eggs
and sperm of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Four different concentrations
of ZA and CA were tested: 1mM, 2mM, 3mM, and 4mM. Replicate dishes
were set up for each concentration. Control dishes with just sperm and eggs
were also set up. 1ml of a 2% egg solution in FSW was placed in each dish.
ZA neutralized to pH 7.8 or CA neutralized to pH 7.6 was added to the dishes
in appropriate volumes such that once the final volume of 5 ml was reached
by adding FSW the desired concentration was established. Sperm were then
added to the dishes at a 1/10,000 dilution. The solutions were stirred and the
sperm and eggs were allowed to fertilize. Samples were removed from the
