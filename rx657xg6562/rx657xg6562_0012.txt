The fertilization experiment comparing the effects of CA, Heparin, and
ZA showed a variance in percent fertilization due to the effects of the
different compounds. Figure 5 shows the effects of these compounds at 13
mMl on fertilization of L. pictus. CA decreased the percentage of fertilized
eggs by 14.1% as compared to the control. Heparin decreased fertilization by
36.9% and ZA by 74.8%.
Figure 6 shows the results of the Protease treatment experiment. 96.0%
fertilization was observed in the control eggs with intact vitelline layers and
no ZA. The ZA treated dishes suppressed fertilization by up to 83% as was
seen in the previous dose response curves. In the experimental dishes
containing the protease treated eggs, fertilization was not inhibited by ZA.
DISCUSSION
Although previous investigations (Todd et al., 1993) demonstrated that
p-(sulphooxy) cinnamic acid inhibited settlement of competent cyprids of B.
amphitrite the mechanism was unknown. A bioassay of chemotactic
response to ZA in B. amphitrite was the first step in determining the
compound's mode of action. Analysis of cyprid distribution in the
chemotaxis assay indicated that ZA exhibited no chemotactic response.
Because the larvae did not move in response to a concentration gradient of
ZA, the compound does not appear to be chemorepellent to the cyprids and
therefore does not inhibit settlement by deterrence. During this experiment it
was observed that the larvae in the 0-25 cm range (those exposed to a much
higher concentration of ZA) were noticeably less active than those in the 25-
50 cm range.
A second possible mode of action for the inhibition of settlement by ZA
was therefore hypothesized to be through effects on swimming behavior. If a
