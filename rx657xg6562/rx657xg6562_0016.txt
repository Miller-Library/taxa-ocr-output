bacterial attachment, and sea urchin fertilization. The results from these
experiments suggest that there may be more than one mode of action.
Zosteric acid not only functions in both its buffered and unbuffered forms, but
also as a sulfated compound and/or simply as a weak acid. Thus, multiple
mechanisms seem to be involved, both individually and synergistically for an
overall antifouling effect.
