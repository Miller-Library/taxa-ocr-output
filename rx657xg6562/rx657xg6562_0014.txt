implicate a role for the sulfate moiety of ZA in inhibition of settlement which
may be a key to the compoundâ€™s mode of action.
The results of the hemagglutination assay showed no agglutination of
the red blood cells in the negative control with fucose. In the experimental
tube with the zosteric acid, agglutination was not prevented and bacteria
attached to the red blood cells, as in the control. Therefore, the only
conclusion that can be made is that ZA at a 3 mM strength does not prevent
bacterial attachment in this assay. These results do not prove that ZA does
not inhibit bacterial attachment, as can be seen in Figure 3. These results
show that at a 3 mM concentration, ZA can suppress the attachment of
bacteria onto glass surfaces by up to 40%. However, coumaric acid was also
shown to suppress attachment by up to 50%. Because both ZA and CA
seemed effective in suppressing the adherence of bacteria, it can be concluded
that the sulfate group on ZA is not the portion of the compound necessary for
inhibiting bacterial attachment.
In the dose response experiments of ZA and CA with S. purpuratus
and L. pictus, a negative correlation was observed between the concentration
of ZA and percent fertilization. As the concentration of ZA increased, percent
fertilization decreased. CA, however, did not show this effect. Because ZA,
the sulphated phenolic ester, was effective and CA, the unsulfated analog of
ZA, was not, it seems that the sulfate group may play a critical role in
inhibiting fertiliation. The fertilization experiment with Heparin further
supports this hypothesis that the sulfate moiety of ZA is a necessary
component in inhibiting fertilization. Heparin was chosen for this
experiment because it is a highly sulfated polysaccharide, known for its
anticoagulant properties. Figure 5 shows that the fertilization inhibiting
action of Heparin is intermediate to the effects of CA and ZA. CA is
