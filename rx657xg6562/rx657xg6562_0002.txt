ABSTRACT
Zosteric acid (p- sulphooxy cinnamic acid) was studied for its role as a
non-toxic antifouling agent. Cypris larvae of B. amphitrite were used to study
the effects of the compound on larval chemotaxis, mobility, and settlement.
Zosteric acid (ZA) elicited no chemotactic response from the larvae and
therefore it does not appear to inhibit settlement by deterrence. ZA and
sodium acetate, a weak acid with a similar pKa, did both cause larval
immobility, possibly acting as weak acids and changing intracellular pH. Both
pH neutralized (8.0) and unbuffered ZA were shown to inhibit settlement by
up to 30%. Because the presence of microbial films can act as settlement cues
for further fouling by both larval invertebrates and algae, ZAâ€™s effect on
bacterial attachment was also investigated. Both zosteric acid, a sulfated
phenolic ester, and p- coumaric acid, an unsulphated analog of ZA, were
found to suppress bacterial attachment. Therefore, it can be concluded from
this study that the sulphate moiety is not the necessary component for
inhibiting bacterial adherance. The effects of ZA were also assayed on the
attachment of sperm to the egg in the fertilization of the sea urchins
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Litichinus pictus. It was found that the
sulphate group on the ZA is necessary for the inhibition of fertilization.
Another fertilization experiment, in which Protease was used to remove the
vitelline layer of the egg, showed that ZA may inhibit fertilization by binding
to the egg receptors on the vitelline layer, thus blocking sperm from
attaching. In conclusion, it should be noted that ZA has a wide variety of
effects and more than one mode of action. Multiple mechanisms seem to be
involved, both individually and synergystically, in producing ZA's
antifouling effect.
