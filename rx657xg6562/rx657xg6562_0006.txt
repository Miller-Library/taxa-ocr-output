Bacterial Attachment
Two different assays were done to test the effects of ZA on bacterial
attachment. The first was a hemagglutination assay done with red blood cells
and bacteria to test for the ability of zosteric acid to prevent agglutination of
red blood cells due to the adherence of bacteria. The experiment was carried
out in eppendorf tubes with an overnight culture of Vibrio cholerae and
human type O- whole blood that was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for five
minutes, washed, and resuspended in phosphate buffered slution (PBS) three
times to arrive at a 5% solution of red blood cells. A 1% solution of fucose,
and 6 mM zosteric acid neutralized to pH 8.0 were additional components.
The first tube contained 15 ul of bacteria and 50 ul of red blood cells in PBS,
the positive control for hemagglutination. The second tube consisted of
bacteria, red blood cells, and 100 ul of fucose (a sugar known to inhibit
hemagglutination). The third tube contained bacteria, red blood cells and 100
ul of 6mM zosteric acid (3mM final concentration in tube). The last two tubes
acted as controls containing red blood cells and either zosteric acid or fucose,
to make sure that these compounds were not affecting the red blood cells.
Appropriate amounts of PBS were added to each tube for a final volume of
200 ul. The tubes were left to sit for 30 min and then samples were removed
and checked under the microscope to observe for bacterial induced
agglutination of the red blood cells.
The second bacterial attachment assay was set up to determine the
relationship between varying doses of zosteric acid in solution and the
density of attached bacteria on a surface. Coumaric acid, an analog of zosteric
acid without the sulphate group, was also tested for the ability to prevent
bacterial attachment to surfaces. Five 50 ml Falcon tubes were set up, each
