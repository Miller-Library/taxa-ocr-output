the two rubber stoppers were not released at the same moment. The side in
which the ZA was added (f1 or f2) was reversed every other experiment. A
control experiment was run exactly as above with one exception¬ 16 ml of
FSW was added to the 0-20 cm section and no ZA was used.
Cyprid Mobility
Plastic Falçon petri dishes were used to evalute the effects of ZA, p
coumaric acid (CA) and sodium acetate on B. amphitrite motility. From 10 to
30 larvae were used in each dish containing 2 ml of solution. 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10
mM concentrations of ZA and 3, 5, and 7 mM of CA were used in both
buffered (pH 8) and unbuffered (pH 3.9 for CA and pH 5.2-5.7 for ZA)
solutions. Sodium acetate was used at 10 mM both buffered with Trisma as
above (pH 8) and unbuffered (pH 5.7). Cyprids were considered motile if they
were noticeably active under the microscope and/or their appendages were
extended after 15 minutes. Two types of control experiments were used: one
contained 2 ml FSW and the other a buffered solution of MES (pH 5.6), both
absent of any of the above weak acids. Two replicate dishes were analyzed for
each concentration, buffered and unbuffered.
Barnacle Settlement Assay
Attachment of cyprids of B. amphitrite was assayed against ZA, CA, and
sodium acetate in plastic dishes (Falcon 43001) containing 20-60 larvae and 5
ml of solution at room temperature. Each experiment was stopped after 24
hours using a few drops of 1 N HCI and the number of attached barnacles
were counted using a dissecting microscope. Varying concentrations of
buffered and unbuffered ZA, CA, and sodium acetate were assayed with 6
replicates for each unbuffered ZA concentration and 4 for each buffered one.
CA and sodium acetate assays were done once. Experiments were disregarded
if there were less than 20 larvae in a petri dish.
