cyprid can not swim it will never find a suitable substrate on which to settle
and will simply remain in the water column until it recovers or dies. A
necessary distinction must be made between toxic and non-toxic compounds
that cause immobility. Although both cause immobility, a narcotic effect was
differentiated from a toxic one in that the former is reversible and the latter is
not (Rittschof et al., 1992). The results from this assay indicate that at 8 mM
ZA and 10 mM sodium acetate the larvae are 100% reversibly immotile and
therefore inhibited from settling. The CA caused complete irreversible
immotility at 5mM. This is clearly because CA is more acidic (pH 3.9) than
both ZA and sodium acetate and too far from the pH of normal sea water for
the larvae to survive. Because a FSW solution of pH 5.7 did not cause
immobilization, acidic extracellular pH does not appear to be the sole
component in producing this behavioral effect. ZA and sodium acetate may
act as weak acids by partitioning across the cell membrane and changing
intracellular pH. The uncharged species is present in higher concentrations
as the pH decreases in approaching the pKa of a weak acid- 4.0 for ZA and 4.74
for sodium acetate. Therefore, the uncharged species is expected to cross the
cell membrane and in this way could affect intracellular pH possibly resulting
in larval immobility.
Non-toxic antifoulers such as ZA seem to be more variable than toxic
agents in their ability to inhibit settlement (Rittschof et al., 1992). Although
high variability existed among the barnacle inhibition assays, it is apparent
from Figure 2 that both buffered and unbuffered ZA inhibited settlement up
to 30%. Because neither CA nor sodium acetate produced the same inhibitory
effect, the mechanism by which ZA prevents settlement cannot be attributed
to larval immobility in which all three compounds were effective. Therefore,
larval settlement appears unrelated to external pH. However, this does
