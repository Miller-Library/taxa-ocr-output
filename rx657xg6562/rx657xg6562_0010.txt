pH 5.2 did not cause larval immotility and in the control experiments (2 ml
FSW) larvae were almost 100% motile.
Barnacle Settlement Assay
Figure 2 shows the dose-effectiveness of pH neutralized and
unbuffered ZA against barnacle settlement. The error bars were determined
by calculating the error (0) using the binomial distribution equation, o
squared=npq, where n equals the total number of replicate experiments, p
equals the fraction of larvae that settled, and q equals the fraction that didnâ€™t.
Four experiments were conducted in which there were more than 20 larvae
in each petri dish. A stock solution of 20 mM ZA (pH 4.2-4.3) was used and
then diluted to 0.05, 0.1, 1, 2, and 3 mM. The pH's of the final solutions were
8.0 in all buffered dishes and 6.5 to 7.6 for 3 mM unbuffered ZA, 7.8 to 7.9 for 2
mM, and 8.0 for 1 mM. pH neutralized and unbuffered percent settlement
were similar at 1, 2, and 3 mM although buffered ZA (pH 8) was a slightly
more powerful inhibitor than unbuffered ZA (pH 6.5 to 7.6) on average and at
each concentration. Neither sodium acetate nor CA significantly inhibited
settlement.
Bacterial Attachment
In the hemagglutination assay, the positive control tube containing
Vibrio cholerae and red blood cells showed significant agglutination due to
the attachment of bacteria (tab. 2). The negative control tube containing
bacteria, red blood cells, and fucose, a known inhibitor of hemagglutination,
showed no agglutination and the red blood cells were free of bacteria. The red
blood cells in the other control wells containing red blood cells and either
hypothetical inhibitor of bacterial attachment, fucose or zosteric acid, without
bacteria were normal. The experimental tube containing bacteria, red blood
