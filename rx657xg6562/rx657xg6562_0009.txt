recorded. The Protease treated eggs were checked for fertilization by
observing for cleavage.
RESULTS
Chemotaxis Assay
The chemotactic effects on the cypris larvae did not differ between the
control and ZA experiments (fig. 1). The number of larvae was greatest in the
20-30 cm range (100% at time zero) and then evenly distributed among the 10-
20 cm and 30-40 cm sections and the 0-10 cm and 40-50 cm sections. Despite
the ZA concentration gradient that was established after sixty minutes
between sides #1 and #2 (2.05 mM and .004 mM respectively) the larvae swam
evenly in both directions.
Cyprid Motility
The motility of the cyprids differed greatly between buffered and
unbuffered ZA, CA, and sodium acetate. Regardless of which of the three
compounds was assayed, the larvae were motile at pH 8 (tab. 1). At 8 mM ZA
and above (pH 5.7 and below), the larvae were 100% reversibly immotile with
appendages contracted upon contact. When placed in FSW, there was almost
100% recovery after 10 minutes. At 5 mM CA and above (pH 3.9 and below),
the larvae were 100% irreversibly immotile upon contact, probably dead. In
10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.7) the larvae were almost 100% reversibly
immotile after 40 minutes. The acidity of the final solution differed between
the same concentrations of the same compound depending on the molarity of
the stock solution from which it was made. The above pH's were calculated
after a 1:1 dilution of ZA or sodium acetate with FSW while CA dishes were
all made from an 8 mM stock solution due to the compoundâ€™s low solubility
in sea water. A solution buffered with MES (pH 5.6) or FSW titrated down to
