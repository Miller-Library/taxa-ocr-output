cepts are at convenient, but not necessarily equivalent, intervals.
Therefore, a site given an exposure rating of 2 is not twice as
exposed as a site rated 4.
The locations of the seven study sites on these shores are
given in Fig. 1. Substrates in sites 1 - 5 are composed of granite,
while those in sites 6 and 7 consist of congrete,
Once the study sites were selected a technique was developed
for sampling percentage cover of lichen species. Previous research¬
ers (Ferry and Sheard, 1969; Fletcher, 1973) agree that percentage
cover is the best method for sampling and assessing saxicolous
crustose and foliose lichens which dominate rocky shores. However,
no previously developed sampling method proved wholly appropriate
to my study sites, as explained below.
Fletcher (i973) surveyed marine lichens by placing transect
tapes along the shore contour, relating transect positions to tide
levels. He sampled lichen with a 10 X 10 cm transparent square
ruled into 100 1 X 1 cm squares. Each 1-cm square over 1/2
occupied by a lichen thallus was counted as 1% cover of that
species. A 50 cme frame was laid at 1/2-m intervals along the
transect tape, and five grids were counted, one in each corner of
the frame, and one in the middle.
This sampling method applied to my study sites proved in-
effective because many lichen species shared each 1 X I cm square.
The thalli of lichens are very small, grow in patches, and often
form mosaic-like patterns containing numerous species. Therefore,
a pin-hit technique proved to be the most accurate method of assess¬
ing percentage cover of individual species.
