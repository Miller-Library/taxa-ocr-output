was removed. Each grid contained 100 dots spaced 1 cm apart on
all sides. To assess percentage cover, the lichen species found
under each dot was identified and recorded as 1% cover. For
each subarea, 3000 points were pooled and analysed to obtain mean
percentage cover values for each species present. In all, 1200
points were counted in each exposure site, except in sites 6 and
7 where only north-facing low rocks were counted.
RESULTS
Analysis of data from the seven sites examined indicates
that six species occur in fairly constant positions in the supra¬
littoral zone.
The chi-square test of independence was performed to assess
the significance of differences in species richness between north¬
facing high rocks, north-facing low rocks, south-facing high rocks,
and south-facing low rocks. The results indicated that aspect is
not a significant factor influencing species richness. However,
when the richness on high rocks was compared with that of low sites,
it was apparent that tidal height influences species richness, on
seaward facing slopes. High rocks contain twice as many different
species than do low rocks.
Exposure also affects species richness. Using Ballantine's
exposure scale, it appears that richness decreases in extremely
exposed and very sheltered environments, with the greatest rich¬
ness exhibited in fairly sheltered sites, for both high and low
rocks (Fig. 2).
The chi-square test of independence for abundance shows that
north-facing rocks exhibit a significantly higher total percentage
