cover by lichens than south-facing rocks (Fig. 3). North-facing,
high rocks show the highest total mean percentage cover of any
subarea within a site.
Certain species are restricted to rocks of a particular aspect,
while others are not. Acarospora schleicheri (Ach.) Moss. only
occurs on south-facing, high slopes. It is present in all but
extremely exposed environments, and is most abundant on exposed
shores (Fig. 4). Conversely, Physcia phaea (Tuck.) Thoms. and
Buellia sp. were found only on north-facing high rocks, in very
low abundance on fairly sheltered shores. The distribution of
the other species investigated appears unrestricted with respect
to aspect.
The full influence of tidal height upon lichen distribution
in areas of varying exposure could not be objectively compared
because the vertical range of available substrate for lichen
colonization differed from site to site. In sites 6 and 7, no
high rocks existed, while in site 4 boulders heavily encrusted
with lichen occur 10 meters above the sea. Where high substrate
was available (sites 1 - 5 ), lichens were abundant.
Some species exhibited a preference for substrate within a
certain vertical range. Aspicilia sp. was most prevalent on high
rocks in exposure areas 2 - 5 (Fig. 5). Only on very exposed
shores was it counted on low rocks. Pyrenocarpus lichen (Fig. 5)
prefers low, north-facing, semi-exposed environments. It was
found even in extremely exposed sites, but reached a peak in
abundance in semi-exposed site 4. Based on the distribution of
these species, this pyrenocarpus lichen appears to be more tolerant
