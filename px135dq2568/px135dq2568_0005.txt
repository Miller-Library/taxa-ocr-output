The transect method was deemed inappropriate because it
resulted in frames filled or partially filled with flowering
plants and barren rocks, or subjectively selected. Further¬
more, transect lengths varied considerably amongst study sites,
so a standard sample size could not be obtained. Similar draw¬
backs were inherent in the sampling methods employed by Ferry
and Sheard (1969).
For each of the seven exposure areas, four subareas were
identified: north-facing high, south-facing high, north-facing
low, and south-facing low slopes. Low study sites began at the
lowest thalli of Lecanora pinguis, generally if on north-facing
rocks on the seaward side. Low sites extended 1.5 vertical meters.
The lower limit of the high sites was the elevation at which angio¬
sperms, notably Mesembryanthemum, became dominant. In each sub¬
area, six 50 cme or larger rocks were selected for sampling
according to the following criteria:
1. Aspect - a compass reading within 20° of due north
or due south. North-facing rocks faced the sea
in all sites.
2. Slope - 45° -
90°
3. Proximity to sea - the six quadrats fulfilling the
above criteria and closest to the ocean were
selected for percentage cover analysis.
A 50 cm clear plastic flexible sheet (quadrat) with five
10 X 10 cm grids drawn with various orientations at the four
corners of the plastic and in the middle was placed on a rock.
To insure random orientation of the quadrat, a sheet of black
plastic was laid on top of the clear plastic and both were posi¬
tioned on the rock. For coverage counting, the black plastic
