DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that aspect has an important
effect in limiting the distribution of Acarospora schleicheri,
which may be considered photophilic, and influences the total
cover of other lichen species. Aspect mainly influences sunlight
exposure, substrate temperature and moisture. In general, south¬
facing rocks receive more sunlight than do north-facing rocks.
The larger amount of heat generated from longer periods of sun¬
shine causes faster evaporation on south-facing rocks. Following
wetting by wave-action or fog, south rock faces tend to dry out
more rapidly than north-facing rocks of the same exposure rating.,
Aspect could account, in part, for the higher percentage cover
documented on north-facing rocks.
Factors other than aspect which could influence the dampness
of the supralittoral zone include substrate slope, fog, tidal
height, wind-speed, wind-direction, and proximity to sea. No
attempt was made to quantify the dampness of the substrate at
various exposures.
The distribution patterns of the supralittoral lichens invest-
igated reflect different degrees of tolerance to salt water spray.
the species found in extremely exposed environments (exposure rating
1), namely Caloplaca bolanderi, L. pinguis, L. phragmites, and
pyrenocarpus lichen being the most tolerant. These results contrast
with the conclusions of Ferry and Sheard (1969) on the Dale Penin¬
sula, England, that none of the nearly 50 species studied show a
preference for shores of any particular exposure. However, these
workers suggest that exposure to salt water may fulfill a nutritional
