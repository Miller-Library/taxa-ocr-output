requirement, not create a stress, for some supralittoral lichen
species.
Species distribution may be further complicated by substrate
competition between species with similar tolerances to salt water.
In low areas and very exposed areas, lichens must also compete
with algae for substrate. At Pt. Pinos, the extremely exposed
study site, the green alga Prasiola occupied the high rocks, where
lichens could be expected in less exposed areas. It appears that
on extremely exposed shores wave action is so strong that sufficient
salt water is carried to even the highest rocks allowing the
establishment of algae, some well above the normal vertical range.
Prasiola and L. pinquis were observed growing side by side on high
rocks at Pt. Pinos, but judging from relative abundance, the alga
possesses a competitive advantage. It should be noted that algae
have much faster growth rates than do lichens.
The physical effects of waves may prohibit lichens from
settling below the tidal heights documented. No upper limit was
observed here, but Wheeler (1938) indicated that Lecanora pinquis
occurred at 40 ft. above sea level at Pt. Lobos
(a very ex¬
posed site).
No grazing on lichens by marine organisms was observed in the
field. However, hundreds of ladybugs were seen crawling on various
lichen species in study sites 1 - 3 during late May. The ladybugs
appeared to be grazing, probably on small organisms dwelling on
lichen, but no gut analyses were performed to verify this observa¬
tion.
