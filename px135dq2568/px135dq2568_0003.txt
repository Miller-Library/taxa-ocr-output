to variations in aspect to the sun and tidal height.
METHODS
A number of north- and south-facing rocks, with up to 10
meters difference in vertical height, situated in varying ex¬
posures located between Pt. Pinos and Monterey Wharf #2 on the
Monterey Peninsula, California (Lat. 36° 38.2', Long. 121° 53.5')
were investigated during May 1982. Generally, high rocks were
pinnacle-like or eroded and fissured boulders; low rocks were
more rounded but differed from high rocks mostly because they
faced the sea or were grounded in sandy beaches.
Exposure ratings were based on Ballantine's exposure scale
(Ballantine, 1961), modified using the following dominant and
equivalent species of algae (I. Abbott, personal communication,
1982):
1. Extremely exposed shores.
Alaria abundant.
2. Very exposed shores.
Laminaria at minus 2.0 ft. tide level.
No Alaria.
Hesperophycus, Fucus common.
3. Exposed shores.
Laminaria at minus 2.0 ft. tide level.
Hesperophycus, Fucus, Pelvetia common in bands
or zones.
Egregia.
4. Semi-exposed shores.
Laminaria
dropping out, seen in occasional patches.
Hesperophycus dropping out.
Pelvetia less common than in 3.
Fucus only found occasionally.
5. Fairly sheltered shores.
No Laminaria, Hesperophycus.
Pelvetia occasional.
Fucus rare (in patches).
6. Sheltered shores.
Only Pelvetia.
7. Extremely sheltered shores.
No permanent brown algae.
This exposure scale is not a simple mathematical scale. The inter¬
