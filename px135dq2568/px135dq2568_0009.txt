rocks.
Some lichens occurred in low numbers at most exposures.
and in the case of Caloplaca bolanderi, this species seemed
to favor low quadrats rather than high quadrats of the same
exposure (Fiq. 4).
The distribution of the two species of Niebla indicates
that they are semi-terrestrial. The Niebla species have a pre-
dominantly landward distribution, often sited on residential
garden rocks along the shore in Pacific Grove, and are encounter-
ed in positions sheltered from sea-water spray, such as crevices
or lee-sides of high rocks.
Species C is the most widespread of these semi-terrestrial
species in the supralittoral zone. It was counted in exposures
ranging from very exposed to fairly sheltered. N. combeoides
(Nyl.) Rund. & Bowl. and N. homalea (Ach.) Rund. & Bowl. were
found in semi-exposed and fairly sheltered high sites, with N.
homalea more abundant on north-facing slopes and N. combeoides
more abundant on south-facing slopes (Fig. 4).
Still other species occurred so rarely or in such specialÂ¬
ized niches that they were not included by the sampling method,
Roccellina condensata (Darb.) Follm. was only found in exposed
and fairly sheltered areas (study sites 3 and 5) in the steep
crevices of high rocks. Accordingly, it was never encountered
in a quadrat. Where R. condensata was observed, it grew abundantly
in thick, dense patches. The presence of this species on the
Monterey Peninsula is a new record for North America,
