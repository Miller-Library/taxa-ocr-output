of sea-water spray than does Aspicilia sp.
Although the height of the highest rock containing lichen
varied amongst sites, the height of the lowest lichen thalli re¬
mained fairly constant with respect to the red alga, Endocladia
muricata (Post. & Rupr.) J. Ag., in all exposure sites. Height
was measured above the top of the Endocladia zone, which occurs
between 1.0 - 2.0 m above zero tide level, using a meter stick
and surveyor's tape. The lowest thalli of L. pinguis or Caloplaca
bolanderi occurred in all exposures between 1.5 and 3.0 meters
above the Endocladia. Perhaps below that height, these species
cannot survive wave action or competition for substrate with
algae.
The distribution of several lichen species may be correlated
with areas of particular exposure to wave action.
Lecanora pinguis, while one of the most common lichens, is
rare on more sheltered shores (exposures 6 and 7) but becomes more
abundant on more exposed high rocks (exposures 1 and 2, as shown
in Fig. 6). Its greatest abundance on north-facing slopes occurs
in exposure site 3, while on south-facing rocks, L. pinguis is most
abundant in very exposed sites (exposure rating 2).
Another species of the same genus, L. phragmites Tuck.,
exhibits the opposite distribution pattern. L. phragmites is rare
or absent on exposed shores, but becomes progressively abundant on
sheltered shores (Fig. 6). It is the dominant species on north¬
facing low rocks in fairly sheltered (exposure 5) to extremely
sheltered (exposure 7) environments. L. phragmites occurs in low
abundance on high slopes and was not encountered on low south-facing
