ABSTRACT
The distribution of twelve supralittoral lichen species was
investigated on the southern shores of Monterey Bay, California
and related to their exposure to sea-water spray, aspect to the
sun, and tidal height. Percentage cover was determined using a
pin-hit technique. Tidal height and exposure to sea-water influence
the distribution of several species, while aspect only affects
one species. Aspect limits the distribution of Acarospora
schleicheri (Ach.) Moss. to south-facing slopes, and influences
the total percentage cover of other lichens. Some species in¬
vestigated reflect different degrees of tolerance to salt water.
Caloplaca bolanderi (Tuck.) Magn., Lecanora pinquis Tuck., Lecanora
phragmites Tuck., and a pyrenocarpus lichen appear most tolerant
to salt water exposure. The physical effects of waves may prohi¬
bit lichens from settling below 1.5 meters above the red alga
Endocladia muricata (Post. & Rupr.) J. Ag., mean height approxi-
mately 1.2 meters above zero tide level. No upper limit was observed.
INTRODUCTION
Though marine lichens have been studied for many years and
their distribution described and quantified on numerous European
shores, sparse data exist on the lichens of Monterey Bay, central
California, or those inhabiting the Western coast of North America.
Two early papers contain descriptions of local lichens, but lack
quantitative data on their distribution. Peirce (1899) investi¬
gated the nature of the association of alga and fungus in Ramalina
reticulata, Usnea, and Sphaerophorus globiferus collected in
Pacific Grove, but did not mention their distribution. Wheeler
