drag, such an action makes no sense metabolically or mechanically. A
barnacle with edge on flow cannot sieve water well because the interception
area of the net, relative to the current, is near zero. Facing the direction
of maximal drag permits maximal water flow across the sieve and thus maximal
feeding. Moreover, as Wainwright and Dillon (1969) explain, an orientation
parallel to the current is less stable than normal to current, on the basis
of torques. Small deviations from an orientation normal to the current
produce only small twisting movements, whereas small deviations from the
parallel orientation cause much greater twisting movements.
CONCLUSION
1. Smaller mass barnacles have cirral nets with greater area relative to
their body mass.
Smaller barnacles have disproportionately larger cirral nets to permit
flow rates, relative to barnacle size, comparable to those of larger
barnacles.
3. Barnacles minimize drag of the extended cirral net in increasing current
speeds primarily through vertically withdrawing their cirri. Barnacles
do not turn their net edge on to the flow to dodge drag,
