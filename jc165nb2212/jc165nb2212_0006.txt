1981). Although the aperture formed by 2 setae and 2 cirri is rectangular,
I assume that this formula can still yield a reasonable estimate of relative
volume flow rate for a setal aperture, differing at most by a constant. Thus,
relative volume flow rate is
9 k dAp
A
where k is a constant and d is one-half the distance between setae. Distance
between setae for an average B. nubilus is 0.0074 mm, and half this distance
can be assumed d. A knowledge of the number of setal apertures extended into
the mainstream at different speeds gives an estimate of the total relative
volume flow rate for the entire cirral net. A graph of relative volume flow
rate for B. nubilus appears in Fig. 10. Volume flow rate increases with
speed, but the rate of increase reaches a maximum near 45 cm/s and gradually
decreases at higher mainstream speeds.
One can also formulate a theoretical relationship for relative volume
flow rate per cirral area as a function of mass, at a fixed mainstream speed.
I assume that a given increase in mass entails an increase in distance
between setae proportional to mass. Although this assumption may not be
entirely true (because smaller mass barnacles have larger nets per body size
and this hints at larger distances between setae, relative to mass, for these
barnacles), it provides a reasonable estimate. Since relative volume flow
rate is
k d'Ap
M
and area of the setal aperture is
Aed?
then for relative volume flow rate per setal aperture area
