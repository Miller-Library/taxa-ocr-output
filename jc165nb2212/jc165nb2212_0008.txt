upward increase of volume flow rate relative to barnacle size for the
balanomorphs less than 0.75 g, and it neglects the factor of metabolism.
H. Barnes and M. Barnes (1959) report a markedly weight dependent oxygen
uptake in barnacles, small barnacles consuming more O, per mass than large
barnacles. O, consumption is proportional to body mass"1/3. Fig. 12 can
therefore be converted to relative volume flow rate per mass, relative to
respiration rate, as a function of barnacle mass (Fig. 13). The high values
at small mass seen in Fig. 12 decrease strikingly. Only a small upward tail
remains. Nevertheless, a difficulty arises. The formerly constant large
mass end of the curve is transformed to a positively sloping line. This
may not be a problem. Barnes' metabolic analysis deals only with barnacles
up to 0.20 g in size. At masses greater than 1.00 g, weight dependent O,
uptake may disappear and metabolic rate may remain more constant with barnacle
size. If barnacles greater than 1.00 g are assumed to have a fairly constant
metabolic rate, then volume flow rate per mass, relative to respiration
rate, is constant (Fig. 13). The only portion of the curve remaining to
be explained is the now small upward tail at small mass,
This upturn may be explained by boundary layer theory. Cirral nets for
barnacles less than 0.50 g, despite their disproportionately larger area,
are still quite small, approximately 7 to 40 mmâ€™. Consequently, these
organisms exist in a boundary layer-a velocity gradient in fluid where speed
changes from zero at the surface to free stream velocity slightly higher
(Vogel, 1981). Denny et al. (1984) estimate a boundary layer thickness of
0.5 om in wave-caused flows. Barnacles less than 0.50 g may see less than
the mainstream speed assumed in calculating volume flow rate because their
whole net is very close to their shell surface and the rock surface. If
true, then the volume flow rate calculated for barnacles less than 0.50 g
