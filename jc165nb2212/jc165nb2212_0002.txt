INTRODUCTION
While many investigators have examined the feeding activity of the
barnacle cirral net (Anderson, 1978, 1980; Barnes and Reese, 1959; Crisp
and Southward, 1961; Southward 1955a, 1955b; Southward and Crisp, 1965;
Stone and Barnes, 1973), no one has examined the relationship between
cirral net area and barnacle body mass. Furthermore, little work has been
directed toward investigating the hydromechanics of the cirral net (Johnson,
1982). In this study I attempt to quantify the relationship between cirral
net and barnacle size, and to explain this relation through hydromechanics.
This effort was quite amenable to laboratory study because of the detailed
information available on cirral morphology (Crisp and Southward, 1961;
Darwin, 1854).
The cirral net of balanomorphs (acorn barnacles), the filter-like
apparatus by which these barnacles sieve sea water for food, consists of six
pairs of heavily setaed cirri (Appendix). The anterior three pairs of cirri
are short and stout, and do not play a large role in sieving water or
forming the cirral net (Crisp and Southward, 1961). The posterior three
pairs of cirri are thin and elongate, and they form the main cirral net area.
Each of these posterior cirri branches at its proximal end into two equally
sized, heavily setaed rami. Consequently, a balanomorph cirral net
resembles a twelve-fingered hand, forming a concave, arched structure when
extended. This twelve-fingered hand achieves its maximal area during
extension, as defined by Crisp and Southward (1961). In extension, the
barnacle holds its cirri outside the shell for varying periods without
rhythmic beating movements.
One might assume cirral net area is directly proportional to barnacle
mass. If this were true, however, the cirral net of the smaller mass
