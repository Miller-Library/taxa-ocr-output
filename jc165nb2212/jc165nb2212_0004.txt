area from sketches of enlarged film negatives, using an Apple II digitizer.
Cirral net area was defined as frontal area, the maximum projection of the
cirri on a plane normal to the flow. Upon completeing area measurements,
I recorded the wet tissue mass of each barnacle without shell.
II. The relation between cirral area and mainstream speed. Using B.
nubilus, I measured cirral net area, maximal cirral height, and maximal
net width at various mainstream speeds. Height and width, like area, were
measured in a plane normal to flow. I later made morphological measurements
of distance between setae extending from the rami, and determined a mean
for the number of setae per cirrus.
III. Drag on the cirral net. The fluid-mechanical force on the cirral
net, drag, was examined using a model (Fig. 2). I mounted the model upsideÂ¬
down on a force transducer (Fig. 3), and manipulated the cirral net into
various configurations. Velocities were adjusted so that the Reynolds
number, a dimensionless index of fluid motion relative to an object, was the
same as that for actual barnacles. Reynolds number values (Re = 1U/2/ where
I is characteristic length, U fluid speed, and/ kinematic viscosity) ranged
from approximately 5,000 to 40,000. Knowing that equality of Reynolds number
implies equality of drag coefficient (Vogel, 1981), I examined in three
separate experiments the effects of mainstream speed, spacing between rami.
and orientation of the net relative to flow. I held all other variables
constant during each of these tests.
RESULTS
The area of the cirral net / body mass is greater for smaller barnacles
(Fig. 4). Area per mass increases rapidly with decreased barnacle mass such
that smaller barnacles (20.40 g) have much greater cirral areas for their
