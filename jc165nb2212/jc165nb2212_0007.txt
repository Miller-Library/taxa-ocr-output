where k' is a constant. Scaling volume flow rate per setal aperture
area to volume flow rate per cirral net area merely increases the constant,
as long as the total number of setal apertures remains the same. Such is
the case at constant velocity. This theoretical procedure yields the graph
in Fig. 11. The rate at which water passes through the cirral net relative
to the area ofthe sieve increases in proportion to the cube root of the mass.
One may obtain relative volume flow rate for the cirral net per
barnacle mass as a function of mass, if the ordinates of the graphs in Figs.
4 and Il are multiplied. This procedure yields a fairly constant volume
flow rate per mass as a function of mass (Fig. 12). That is, the rate at
which a balanomorph cirral net sieves water relative to barnacle size is
roughly constant over barnacle sizes, above a mass of 0.75 g.
DISCUSSION
The disproportionately larger cirral nets seen in smaller mass barnacles
maintain a fairly constant flow rate of water through the sieve relative
to body mass. Intuitively this makes sense. If a small barnacle had a
cirral net in the same proportion to its mass as that of a large barnacle,
areas of setal apertures would be too small to allow a large enough flow rate
for the barnacle to survive. The cirral net would almost act as a solid
wall, with the cirri and setae all closely spaced. To compensate for this,
the smaller barnacles have developed larger cirral nets, with correspondingly
larger setal apertures, to permit flow rates per barnacle mass roughly equal
to those of their larger barnacle counterparts. Equal flow rates per mass
would enable smaller barnacles to sieve water equally well for their body
size.
This argument, nonetheless, has two problems. It neglects the slight
