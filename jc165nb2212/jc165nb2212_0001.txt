ABSTRACT
Balanomorph barnacles use their cirral net as a sieve to strain food
from sea water. Previous investigations have documented activity of the
barnacle cirral net, but no study has examined the relationship between
barnacle body mass and cirral net size. This study explores this relation¬
ship, employing a hydromechanical approach. I found that smaller barnacles
have cirral nets with greater area relative to their body mass. An exami¬
nation of flow through the cirral net shows that this disproportionate
area allows flow rates through the net, relative to body size, comparable
to those of larger barnacles. In increasing current speeds, barnacles
minimize drag of the extended cirral net primarily through vertically
withdrawing their cirri. Barnacles do not turn their net edge on to the flow
to dodge drag, as earlier reported.
