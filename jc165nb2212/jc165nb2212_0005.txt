Cirral net area changes, however, with mainstream speed. Net area for
the test barnacle increases to a maximum at 26 cm/s andthen decreases at
higher speeds (Fig. 5). Width and height, the components of area, follow
similar trends (Fig. 6), although height decreases more markedly at higher
speeds. No substantial change occurs in the angle at which the barnacle
extends its net relative to a plane normal to the flow as mainstream speed
increases; that is, no substantial bending of the net backward or sideways
occurs.
Drag on the cirral net is proportional to the square of mainstream
speed (Fig. 7). This result agrees with the theoretical prediction (Vogel,
1981) that
D - 2 CpPSU
where D is drag, Cp the drag coefficient, o density of sea water, S area, and
U speed. Constancy of drag coefficient as a function of Reynolds number
(Fig. 8) supports this relationship. Drag does not differ significantly
with ramal spacing (Table 1). Drag does vary with orientation of the cirral
net relative to flow (Fig. 9). Forces reach a maximum with the cirral net in
its normal position, perpendicular to the current (0°), and achieve a minimum
with the net edge on to the flow (90°),
Further calculations can estimate the relative volume flow rate--the
volume of water passing through the barnacle's sieve per time--as a function
of mainstream speed. For a singular circular aperture, reasonably far from
other apertures and at a Reynolds number less than 3.
