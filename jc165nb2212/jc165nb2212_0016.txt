Fisher
Drag as a function of orientation relative to flow for the
Figure 9
model. 0° is when the cirral net is normal to flow, and 90°
is when the net edge is on to the flow. Mainstream speed - 54.2
cm/s. Flags denote standard errors.

speed.

A theoretical calculation of relative volume flow rate per cirral
net area as a function of barnacle mass.
Figure 12
Relative volume flow rate per barnacle mass as a function of
barnacle mass. Ordinate values are the product of ordinates in
Figs. 4 and 11.
Figure 13 Relative volume flow rate per barnacle mass, relative to respi¬
ration rate, as a function of barnacle mass (darkened line).
Dashed line represents the case where barnacle metabolic rate is
roughly constant for barnacles greater than 1.00 g.
