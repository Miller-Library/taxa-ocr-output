Fisher
would be slightly higher than the real value. Using a corrected, lower
speed in determining flow rates for these barnacles would lower the volume
flow rate values. This would then yield constancy in the ordinates of Fig.
13 to demonstrate that smaller mass barnacles have relatively larger cirral
net areas to maintain flow rates per barnacle size approximately equal to
those of larger barnacles.
In B. nubilus net area increases slightly to a maximum as mainstream
speed increases, and then area decreases noticeably. This decrease may
result as the barnacle tries to take advantage of the faster current, an
obvious aid for suspension feeders, while minimizing drag as much as possible.
Since drag increases rapidly with mainstream speed (drag is proportional
to the square of speed), retraction of the cirral net to decrease area, and
thus drag, almost seems a necessity.
The mechanism by which barnacles decrease cirral area appears to be
retraction of the cirri, rather than decrease of ramal spacing. Changing
ramal spacing has no substantial effect on drag because the intrinsic shape
of the net does not change much. When ramal spacing changes, setae overlap
still remains and the cirral net retains its same overall concave, arched
structure. Moreover, greater decreases in height than width of the net at
higher speeds indicate height is the area component more responsible for the
area change. The barnacle probably withdraws the cirri vertically, and any
change in ramal spacing is merely a physical requirement to bring the cirri
through the operculum.
The barnacles examined here do not, as previously reported (Crisp and
Southward, 1961) put their net edge on to the flow to dodge drag. Not once
did I observe a barnacle put its net edge on to the flow, although I used
mainstream speeds up to 100 cm/s. While putting edge on to flow minimizes
