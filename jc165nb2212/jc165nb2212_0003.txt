barnacles would approach such tiny dimensions that it would appear impos¬
sible to sieve water through the minute apertures formed by setae between
rami. Logically, smaller barnacles should have cirral nets with greater
area relative to their body mass to facilitate flow rates, relative to body
mass, equal to those of larger barnacles. A hydromechanical approach is
needed to examine such an issue. I sought the answers to three questions:
1. Do smaller mass barnacles have cirral nets with greater area
relative to body size?
2. If smaller barnacles have disproportionately larger cirral nets,
is this to permit flow rates, relative to barnacle mass, equal
to those of larger barnacles?
3. How do barnacles minimize drag in the extended cirral net position?
METHODS
I. The relation between cirral area and barnacle mass. I collected
20 barnacles from among the species Tetraclita rubescens (13 barnacles),
Balanus glandula (5 barnacles), and Balanus nubilus (2 barnacles) on the
periphery of the Great Tide Pool, Pacific Grove. After giving the animals
a twenty-four hour recovery period, I placed eachbarnacle in a flow tank
(Fig. 1), as described by Vogel and LaBarbera (1978). I increased sea water
speed in the tank until cirral net extension occurred. I then photographed
a posterior view of the extended cirri through amirror placed behind the
barnacle at a 45° angle to flow. Portions of the flow tank's trough walls
were covered to prevent any shading response caused by a reduction in the
amount of light falling on the barnacle. Water temperature remained fairly
constant at 14.2° + 0.3°C throughout this procedure. I measured cirral net
