Anaerobic metabolism in snails
paper is the transfer from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism which
often occurs after the potential of the other methods has been
exhausted(7,12,14,20).
In most species, the switch to anaerobic metabolism is a
switch to the lactate producing pathway of glycolysis (8). But not
all invertebrates accumulate lactate during glycolysis (11,21). A¬
nother glycolytic pathway that employs the linkage of amino acid
with carbohydrate metabolism has been shown to exist in a number
of invertebrates (1,7,8,18) including the parasitic round worm
Ascaris (15), and the intertidal bivalves Rangia, Crassostrea,
and Volsella (2,6,18,19). The pathway is shown in figure 1. Some
features to note in it are: 1). 8 moles of AIP are produced as
oppossed to the 2 moles made during lactate-producing glycolysis
and so it conveys an adaptive advantage to any organism capable of
using it. 2). it accumulates succinate, alanine, and sometimes
propionate instead of lactate.
The existence of this pathway was investigated in two of the
gastropods which inhabit the intertidal zone of central California 's
rocky coast - Nucella Emarginata, and Acanthina Puntulata. These
were selected for the following reasons: One of them, the Nucella
belongs to a genus in which some other species have been shown to
possess quantities of the enzymes malic dehydrogenase, lactate dehy¬
drogenase, pyruvate kinase, and pyruvate-carboxykinase in proportions
