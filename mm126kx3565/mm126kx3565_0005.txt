Anaerobic metabolism in snails
respire for 64 hours in a bath of 17° C water. An equal number of
controls were placed in open vials and kept under the same condi¬
tions except that there was free exchange of oxygen between the
vial and the air.
After the test period, all animals were frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and homogenized in perchloric acid according to the pro¬
cedure of Williamson (24) with only one modification; the whole
snail was dropped into the liquid nitrogen instead of being frozen
between freeze clamps. The extracts were then assayed for the
end products according to Williamson (23) for alanine ; Williamson
(24) for succinate with a modification in the concentration of AlP
by a 10 fold increase; and according to Gutman (5) for lactate.
All assays were spectrophotometric measurements of the change
in absorbtion resulting from a change in the concentration of NADH
according to the equations shown in figure 2. Figure 2 also gives
a flow chart of the major steps in the experiment.
RESULITS
Based on an average consumption rate of 124 ul/g/hr of oxygen
for a group of similar gastropods (4,12), and on an average animal
weight of 2 grams per vial for the Nucella, and 5.3 grams'per vial
for Acanthina, theloxygen in these vials should have been exhausted
in less than 23 hours in the case of Nucella, and in less than 9
