Anaerobic metabolism in snails

level of resolution by a factor of three.
However if some justifiable reason for elimination of the
negative readings could be found, some results fall out of this
data. Certainly negative readings are impossible to interpret as
they directly correspond to negative concentrations - which are
impossible. If any of this data had a remote chance of being cor¬
rect, it would have to be the positive readings.
Knowingly taking the experimental bias of considering all ne-
gative values as zero readings, and all positive values as real,
the results in figure 4 can be obtained. In the Nucella, the ave¬
rage accumulation of alanine was greater in the anaerobic animals
than in the aerobic ones. The ratio of anaerobic to aerobic con¬
centration is an indication of how much greater. For Nucella this
ratio is greater than 2.5. Also, the accumulation of lactate in
the anaerobic tissue is only slightly greater than the same in the
aerobic tissue. For the Acanthina, both the accumulation of ala¬
nine and lactate are nearly the same for both extracts.
If these results were acceptable, they would indicate an af¬
firmitive conclusion regarding the existence of the pathway in fi¬
gure one in Nucella, and would imply that either the Acanthina
does not have it, or that conditions were not sufficiently vigorous
to force the snail into anaerobic metabolism.
