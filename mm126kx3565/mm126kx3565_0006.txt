Anaerobic metabolism in snails
for the Acanthina - even if the vials were not flushed with any
nitrogen. Nitrogen flushing served to minimize both the possibilty
of aquatic and aerial respiration, and also it minimized the possi¬
bility of death due to dessication because seawater could be left
in the vial.
A preliminary check on the sensitivity of the assays showed
the alanine and lactate assays to be about 10 times less sensitive
than expected. The succinate assay did not work at all, presum¬
ably because of instability in the enzyme succinic thiokinase which
initiates the whole reaction. The succinate assay was therefore
eliminated. The results (in change of absorbance) of the remaining
two assays are shown in figure 3.

The high number of negative values for both the aerobic and
anaerobic samples are difficult to explain. Both normal change in
absorbance in blanks, and when NADH concentration is changed cause
only positive changes in absorbance. Negative readings may have
resulted from localized heating in the cuvettes, producing convec¬
tion currents which alter the absorbance of the solution. Another
possibility is that there are some other compounds present in the
mixture whose absorbance in UV light also decreases upon addition
of the final reagent.
The other explanation of negative results is that these numbers
- 6.
