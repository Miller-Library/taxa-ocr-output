Anaerobic metabolism in snails
ABSTRACT
The existence of an anaerobic metabolic pathway which accumulates
alanine and succinate was tested for in two snails which inhabit the
intertidal region of the central Californian coast. Anaerobic con¬
ditions were induced by maintaining experimental animals in nitrogen
flushed vials for 64 hours after which the whole soft tissue was
assayed for alanine, succinate, and lactate. These assays were com¬
pared against the same for a set of controls. Results did not de¬
monstrate an accumulation of more alanine, succinate, or lactate in
the snails under anaerobic conditions than in the aerobic controls.
