that are characteristic of the animals which are known to have this
pathway (2,16,17,18). In the lab, both species demonstrated an
ability to survive for ar least 30 hours in a nitrogen flushed en¬
vironment - in the case of Nucella, the length of survival exc eded
5 days for 75% of the specimens. Both species are left dry for
reasonably long periods during low tide, and are therefore  suscep¬
table to the type of dessication stress that leads to anaerobiosis.
Both have shells into which they may retreat during dry periods,
thus closing off the organism from the oxygen containing medium
which surrounds it.
The build up of the end products alanine, and succinate can
be used as a means to detect the existence of the pathway. The
hypothesis upon which this paper is based is this - If this path¬
way is utilized in these snails, then those which have been placed
under conditions which would induce anaerobiosis should possess a
greater amount of these end products in their tissue then thos
left to respire aerobicly. Furtheremore, there should be no sig¬
nificant difference in the lactate levels between the two. An
assay for lactate was therefore also added.
MATERTALS AND METHODS
Two snails each were placed in 30 ml vials containing 0.5 ml
of seawater, all flushed with 99.9% nitrogen gas for 60 seconds.
The vials were capped, and taped closed, and the snails left to
