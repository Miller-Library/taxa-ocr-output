Anaerobic metabolism in snails
represent random changes in the overall absorbance of the solu¬
tion. If this were the case, all positive results within the same
range of absolute values would also have to be considered random.
Indeed, statistical tests indicated that the whole of the values
obtained for both the aerobic, and anaerobic extracts were not
significantly different than zero. This of course means that no
difference between the experimental and control animals could be
determined.
Zero readings lend themselves to two interpretations. 1).
there is no measurable increase in the alanine or lactate concen¬
trations when snails are kept under anaerobic conditions over when
they are not, and so the animals do not possess the pathway in
question, or they utilize a similar pathway which may accumulate
succinate for exanple, but does not accumulate alanine or lactate.
2). The assay itself is not sensitive enough to measure the small
concentrations of these products which for alanine should be near
.78 mg/gram fresh tissue - assuming a value near the average for
other gastropods (3).
In light of the statistical finding that the numbers are not
different than zero, the later explanation is most probable.
In fact, when the concentrations inplied by these results were
conpared to the minimum resolving ability of the assays according
to the original authors it was found that the highest reading cor¬
responded to a concentration that was lower than the confident
