Anaerobic metabolism in snails
INTRODUCTION
Nst of the animals which inhabit the midtide forest are adapted
for metabolizing carbohydrates via the oxygen requiring respiratory
pathway common to most members of the animal kingdom. Being ma-
rine, they are primarily adapted for respiration in an aquatic me¬
dium, though many are quite capable of aerial respiration when the
tide is out. (12,14).
However the capacity for aerial respiration is functional on¬
ly so long as the gill surface of the animal remains relatively
wet.(12,14). When evaporative water loss becomes severe,aerial
respiration must be halted to prevent the possibility of death due
to dessication. (12,14).
Numerous well known strategies and combinations of strategies
are employed by the intertidal invertebrates for coping with this
problem. These include: the use of oxygen stored in body fluids
via respiratory pignents such as in the worm Urechis.(12), the use
of oxygen trapped in mantle cavities as for example in certain.
Littorine snails (12), and the use of some form of metabolic slow
down akin to hibernation, such as the lowering of heart rate which
occurs in the bivalve Mytilus Edulis (12).
A final strategy, and the one of particular relevance to this
