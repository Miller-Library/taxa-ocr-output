Anaerobic metabolism in snails
OS
FIGURE CAPT
Essentials of the succinate producing anaero¬
bic metabolism found in several invertebrates.
Note the evolution of 8 moles of ATP and the
accumulation of alanine, succinate, and propi¬
onate.
Flow of steps in this experiment. Final assay
for end productswere based on change in concen¬
tration of NAD according to these equations.
Results of assays for alanine and lactate.
The units are absorbtion, and represent the
change in absorbtion which occurs in the
assay mixture after addition of the enzymes.
Change in absorbtion is directly related to
concentration of end product.
Relativeanounts of end products accumulated
in anaerobic and aerobic tissue of Nucella
and Acanthina. Results are based upon extreme
expiremental bias as described in text.
