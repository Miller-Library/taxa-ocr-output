Anaerobic metabolism in snails
Mark Roberts
ONCLUSION
Only by allowing for extreme experimental bias may it be said that
any of this data provides evidence for or against the existence of
succinate-producing glycolysis in these two snails. In light of
the prior conclusion that the assays employed were not sensitve e-
nough to detect any end products, the ultimate conclusion of this
paper must be that the existence of this interesting biochemical
pathway still awaits further investigation in these species.
