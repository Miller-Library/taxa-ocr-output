Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
of the brood fluid of P. scaber and I. resecata suggest
that the mother is actively concentrating solutes within
the brood fluid. I. resecata, despite observation of
active ventilåtion of the marsupium (approximately 22 times
per minute) through mechanical contraction of the brood
cavity and movement of brood plates, maintains a marsupium
of brood fluid 150 to 200% normal seawater osmotic solute
concentration. Brood fluid of P. scaber is between 8 to 14%
or two to three times that of seawater (fresh water rated
at 0.2%). Blood of P. scaber is approximately 3.5%.
SUMMARY
Evidence suggests that developing embryos increase
in both inorganic and organic weight within the brood
pouch. Brood fluid appears to contain a higher concen¬
tration of solute than other fluids found in the animals'
environment. Several hypotheses can be developed to
describe these results:
the mother is actively concentrating minerals
and/or nutrients within the brood fluid
b) a decrease in brood size is noted through
development. Perhaps decaying embryos provide
an important source for other developing embryos.
More work is needed to concretely say if the mother
is actively supplying minerals and/or nutrients to
