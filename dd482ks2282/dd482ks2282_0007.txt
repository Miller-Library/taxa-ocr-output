Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
As expected, development within the brood pouch was more
advanced than in cultures. Highlighted bars of graphs
3B, 4A, and 5A show a decrease in dry weight of embryos
going from stage 1 to stage 2 (which cannot be entirely
accounted for by normal embryo weight variation within
a brood) compared to the original weight of the brood;
this decrease can be accounted for by an absolute decrease
in organic weight perhaps as vitelline reserves of yolk
are utilized. Apparent anomalies such as 3AN, 3CS, 4AS2,
in which an increase in organic weight was observed despite
no increase in dry weight cannot be readily explained.
In bars 4BST, 4BS2, 5AN, 7AR, 7AS, 7CR, the increase in
dry weight can be entirely accounted for by increases
in inorganic weight. However, in graphs 5BR, 5CR, 7BR,
8A and 8B (charting development from stage 2 to stage 3),
increases in dry weight cannot be entirely accounted for
by increases in inorganic weight. There appears to besa
definite increase in both absolute inorganic weight and
absolute organic weight. While the noted anomalies in
graphs of development from stage 1 to stage 2 can perhaps
suggest that observed weight changes could be due to normal
variation within embryos of a particular brood, the
magnitude of the weight changes from stage 2 to stage 3
far exceed the maximum limits of these possible intra-brood
