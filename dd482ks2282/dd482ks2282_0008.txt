Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
weight variations. Thus a significant increase in both
organic and inorganic weight in some embryos (particularly
from stage 2 to stage 3) occurred.
Of special interest is the apparent differences in
increase of absolute organic weight in graphs 8A and 8B.
At the termination of the experiment, the larvae represented
in bars 8AS, 8A82, 8B83, had cannabalized several other
embryos. Perhaps this was the source of the additional
increase in inorganic and organic weight.
Tests for total nitrogen content in the various
embryonic stages, which involved first digesting ten
embryos of each stage by the Folin-Wu method, then assaying
for ammonia content by the phenol-hypochlorite method,
suggest that the ratio nitrogen/drybody weight is constant:
that is, as dry weight increases, total nitrogen increases.
Such a result would support the hypothesis that organic
weight increases during development, but the results
of the tests were not statistically significant perhaps
due to a small sample size. However, during development,
the embryo is apparently utilizing an additional source
of organidand inorganic compounds, aside from those
originally contained within the egg itself.
The most obvious source of additional nutrients
would be the brood fluid itself. Refractometer studies
