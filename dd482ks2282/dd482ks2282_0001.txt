Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
The brood pouch or marsupium in isopods, located
ventrally on the animal, is formed of five pairs of
brood plates or oostegites which arise from the inner
regions of the basis of the first five pairs of pareao-
pods. The edges of the plates overlap to a large
degree, but there is no evidence of a structural inter-
locking mechanism of plates. Embryos within the
marsupium in both marine and terrestial species are
bathed in a "marsupial fluid" which fills the brood
chamber.
The mechanical protection of the developing brood
by the marsupium in part explains the biological
significance of the structure. However, if this were
its only function, the brood might more appropriately
remain in the body cavity. Verhoeff (1920) suggests
other advantages provided by the marsupium:
a) The marsupium is capable of a much greater
expansion than the body cavity and therefore
can harbor a more numerous brood.
