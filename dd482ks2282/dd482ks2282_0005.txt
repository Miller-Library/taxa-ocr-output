Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
portrayed in graphs 1B and 2B were done two weeks after
the studies in 1A and 24. The fact that these second
studies show similiar significant trends suggests that
seasonal variation is not a factor. Further, in the
course of following experiments, embryo weights for the
three stages were obtained for other purposes and were
similiar to those weights observed in graphs 1 and 2.
The dry weight increase between stage 2 and stage?3
can be attributed to inorganic uptake alone. (primarily
minerals), organic uptake alone, or a combination of both.
Individual broods corresponding to the three develop-
mental stages in both P. scaber and I. resecata were
divided in the following ways: partt of the brood was
removed from the mother (gentle pipetting of embryos
after brood plates slightly lifted) and utilized for
ex-marsupial cultures; part of the brood was immediately
weighed; remainder of the brood was allowed to develop
normally within the mother. Ex-marsupial culture dishes
consisted of 50X12 mm tight-lid Petri dishes (holes in
lid for oxygen exchange) filled with five milliliters
of either:
filtered seawater and penicillin (50 parts/million)
a)
plus tris buffer pH 8.3
