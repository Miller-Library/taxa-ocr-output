Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
from the embryo pool and weighed in each of five trials.
Bar graph total height indicates mean wet weight of
one embryo. Each bar is divided into two sections; the
lower section represents mean dry weight of one embryo.
In graphs 1B and 2B (mothers individuated) each mother's
brood was sampled independently. Graphical representation
is identical to the previous graph.
There is a significant decrease in dry weight
in development from stage 1 to stage 2 in two of four
trials (p=0.01), and a decrease in dry weight between
stage 1 and stage 2 with probability less than 0.1 and
0.4 in the other two trials. However, as development
proceeds from stage 2 to stage 3, dry weight increases
significantly again in three of four trials (p = 0.001),
and increases with probability less than 0.4 in the other.
The apparent constant increase in size of the developing
embryo can in part be attributed to the constant increase
of wet weight. Mean embryo weight never varied more than
2 ug between samples at each stage (sample size: three
embryos each stage), which is within the limits of accuracy
of the balance.
Seasonal variation of nutrient availability, temper-
ature, etc., probably cannot account for any observed
differences in weight between stages, since the studies
