stage 3: late larvae; exoskeleton and appendages
well formed; pleopod beat visible in marine
species; larvae motile; completely free
of membrane.
I studied these stages to determine if the brood
receives any organic and/or inorganic nutrients di
during the brood period. Relative wet and dry weights
(corrected for salt content of surface seawater on embryo)
of the three developmental stages were compared for both
P. scaber and I. resecata. Fifteen mothers of each
species were collected for this study, including five
mothers containing stage 1 embryos, five containing stage 2
and five containing stage 3 embryos. Wet weights were
obtained by placing embryos on glass fiber filter paper,
removing surface water with gentle vacuum, and immediately
weighing. Dry weight was obtained by weighing these same
embryos dessicated for 48 hours to constant dryness.
Five embryos were weighed in each trial, on a Cahn electro-
gram balance with an accuracy of + 2.5 ug. Results for
I. resecata and P. scaber are plotted in graphs 1 and 2.
In graphs 1A and 2A, the embryos from the five
mothers of one stage were combined to form one large
embryo pool of a particular stage (graph designation:
mothers pooled). Five embryos of each stage were removed
