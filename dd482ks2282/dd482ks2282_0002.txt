Embryonic Development within the Marsupium
b) The brood, despite lying outside the mother,
is still within a cavity, and is protected
from strong evaporation and dessication.
In addition to these advantages, it can be suggested
that the brood pouch is an important structure mediating
mineral, nutrient, and metabolic exchange between mother
and embryo. Verhoeff discounts this final function,
but Saudray and Lemercier (1960), in noting a consider-
able increase in embryo size before hatching (in Ligia
oceanica) and an even more rapid increase in weight after
hatching, in great part due to mineral uptake, suggest
that such increases were of maternal origin.
I will attempt to determine whether indeed the mother
contributes to embryonic development by supplying organic
nutrients and/or minerals within the brood fluid in
Porcellio scaber (Latreille 1804) and Idothea resecata
(Stimpson 1857).
For my purposes, the brood within P. scaber and I.
resecata were assigned three developmental stages:
stage 1: early egg; only yolk visible; roughly
spherical.
stage 2: middle larvae; eye spots visible; larvae
elongate within membrane; body curved
away from developing appendages.
