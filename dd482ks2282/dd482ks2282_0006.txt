After one week, at 14°0. embryo dry and ash weights
were obtained (ashed at 290°C, 12 hours) and compared
to dry and ash weights of original embryos and original
embryos allowed to develop normally within the brood
pouches of the marked original mothers. Results are
plotted in graphs 3 to 8. Animals that died before the
end of the week period were not included in the results.
Each separate graph 3 to 8 charts the developmant
of a particular brood. Each bar charts mean actual
weight change per animal during the experimental period.
Total height of the bar represents mean dry weight of
one animal; each bar is divided into two sections; the
lower section represents ash weight (a measure of inorganic
weight) whilethe upper portion represents ash-free weight
(organic weight). Numbers above the bar represent the
stage of the embryo at the end of the experiment.
The changes in dry weights during development in
graphs 1 and 2 were confirmed within a particular brood.
