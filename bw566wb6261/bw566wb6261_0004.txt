RESULTS: A diagram of the area of study is presented in Figure
1, which includes descriptive information. Wave size generally
increases along the shore from transect 1 to transect 7. The
sand throughout this stretch of beach was well sorted and par¬
ticle size did not differ appreciably within transects. Av¬
erage particle size increased,however, with increasing distance
from Pier +2. The organic content of the sand along each tran¬
sect was patchy. Average organic content appeared to decrease
with increasing distance from the pier. The organic content
of the darkened sulfide layer was generally higher than that
of the sand above it. On transects 1 through 4, a darkened
sulfide layer was found while on transects 5 through 7, the
sulfide layer was not present. In general, from transect 4
to transect 1, the sulfide layer increased in darkness. No
relationship was found between tidal level and degree of dark¬
ening. It was noted, however, that the layer was generally
darker with increasing depth into the sand.
To determine the topography of the sulfide layer, a study
of a 400 square foot area adjacent to Pier +2, see Figure 1,
was undertaken. Lines and levels were used and measurements
of the depth of the sulfide layer were made at two foot inter¬
vals. The results were then plotted as depth below a reference
point equivalent to the highest point in the study area, and as
depth below the surface of the sand. Depth below the surface
varied from 5 to 25 cm and showed no definite relationship
to the surface topography of the sand.
