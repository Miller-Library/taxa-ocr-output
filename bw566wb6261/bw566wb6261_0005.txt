To test the effect of particle size and organic content on
the formation of the sulfide layer, a series of glass 500, 1000,
and 2000 ml cylinders were prepared to simulate field conditions.
Three grades of sand were used singly and in a mixture. Fine
sand corresponded to a particle size passing .250mm and caught
by .125mm screens, medium sand passed .500mm and was caught by
.25Omm screens, coarse sand passed 2.00mm and was caught by
50Omm screens, and mixture was a combination of equal weights
of fine, medium, and coarse sand. Sodium acetate in seawater
solution was used to vary the organic content of these pre¬
parations. The concentrations of sodium acetate used were
1.0%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, and 0.0%. As an in¬
dicator of the production of HoS, ferrous sulfate was added
to a concentration of 0.02%. No effect related to cylinder
volume was observed.
The cylinders were filled to a height of 40 cm, mixed
with a seawater solution by repeated inversion, allowed to
settle, and maintained close to 13°C in total darkness to
prevent the growth of photosynthetic organisms. They were
inspected at intervals and rated as to color.
In addition, sulfide formation in a percolation unit was
studied. An apparatus modeled after Kaufman (1966) was con-
structed from clear plastic tubing with an inside diameter
of 7.5 cm and 60 cm in length. The column was filled to a
height of 50 cm with fine sand. The rate of percolation was
maintained close to 10 ml per minute. The rate of supply of
solution was 15 ml per minute, thereby creating an overflow
