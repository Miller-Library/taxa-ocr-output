in suspension. The finer grade of sand can also contribute
to increased organic content by sieve-like trapping of organic
material. A mixture of sand should also produce a fine sieve
through the filling of large pores with the smaller sand part¬
icles.
The presence and darkness of a sulfide layer on Del Monte
beach increases with decreasing wave action, decreasing particle
size, and increasing organic content. The laboratory experi¬
ments using cylinders also show an increase in darkening with
increasing organic content, especially in a fine grade or mix¬
ture of sand. The final degree of darkening of a sulfide layer
could be dependent upon the available supply of organic mater¬
ial and length of time it stays in deposits. The difference
in coloration between the stagnant cylinders and the percolation
tubes at the same concentration of sodium acetate is probably
due to the extended maintenance of required organic material
as sodium acetate in the percolation system.
Although on Del Monte beach the darkened layer was found
only in areas of finer sand, the coarse particles in the stag¬
nant cylinders also gave rise to darkened sand. The differ¬
ence in these observations may be explained by the stagnancy
of the cylinders as opposed to the instability of a sandy beach.
In the laboratory, the stagnant system required at least five
days of incubation before a sulfide layer appeared. On a
sandy beach, where erosion and deposition of sediments may
occur constantly, accumulation of organic material is inhibited
and anaerobic bacteria may be exposed to oxygen often enough
