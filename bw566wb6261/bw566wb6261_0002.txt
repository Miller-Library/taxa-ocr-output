INTRODUCTION: During preliminary studies of several Monterey
Bay sandy beaches, it was noticed that a black sulfide layer
occurred on some beaches but not on others. Perkins (1957)
dealt with the characteristics of the layer, but made no men¬
tion of the conditions necessary for its formation. Bruce (1928)
referred to the sulfide layer as existing where the sand ap¬
peared to be of a finer grade and organic debris naturally ac¬
cumulated. An investigation was begun to determine some of the
physical parameters necessary for the formation of the sulfide
layer. Those factors studied were sand size, wave size, and
organic content of the sand.
In the laboratory effects of particle size and organic
content on the formation of the sulfide layer were studied
using both a stagnant and a percolating system. These exper¬
iments were designed to augment field observations.
During the preliminary studies a sharp decline in both
the abundance and diversity of meiofauna was found. Zobell
(1946) remarked that the bacteria in the sulfur cycle in the
sea "might yield water or mud uninhabitable to other organisms
or may be growth promoting". Hulings (1971) suggested that the
sulfide layer might be an area of enriched meiofauna. Perkins
(1958) found that within the sulfide layer the population of
nematodes was only 14.6% of the population above the layer.
In view of these discrepencies a study to examine the distri¬
bution of meiofauna within and above the sulfide layer was
included in the current study.
