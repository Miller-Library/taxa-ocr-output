ABSTRACT: A study of the sulfide layer on Del Monte beach in
Monterey, California was conducted to determine the effects
that wave size, sand size, and organic content might have on
the layer. Meiofauna distributions were also examined in
relation to this darkened sand. A sulfide layer was found
to form under conditions of decreased wave action, decreased
sand size, and increased organic content. Laboratory experi¬
ments augmented these findings on sand size and organic con¬
tent, with increasing organic content increasing the dark¬
ness of the layer. Meiofaunal counts were found to drop sharp¬
ly in the sulfide layer, not only in the number of organisms,
but also in the diversity.
