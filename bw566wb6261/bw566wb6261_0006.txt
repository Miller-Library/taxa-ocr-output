and a constant head of 10 cm. The solution was recycled from
a five gallon reservoir. Sodium acetate in seawater at concen¬
trations of 0.1%, and 0.05% were used as well as seawater with¬
out additions. The contents of the reservoirs were changed
every twelve hours.
In the stagnant system of cylinders, the darkened sand
appeared first as a myriad of small darkened areas which later
merged together to provide a more homogeneous darkening. The
entire cylinder darkened and never was a layer of undarkened
sand found in the stagnant cylinders. The minimum incubation
period required for noticeable darkening was five days. Gen¬
erally, the cylinders with higher concentrations of sodium ac¬
etate solution darkened most rapidly and were of a darker color
after fifteen days of incubation. In solutions of concentra¬
tions of 0.1% and above, the fine and mixed sands were darker
after fifteen days than were the coarse and medium sands. There
appeared to be no overall relationship between the original or-
ganic content of the sand and the degree of darkening.
In the percolation system, greater concentrations of sodi¬
um acetate solution in seawater again gave rise to an increased
rate of formation of the sulfide layer. The minimum period for
a noticeable degree of darkening was seven days. In contrast
to the stagnant system, at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.05%
sodium acetate solution in the percolation unit, darkening
began ten om below the sand surface. After ten days, however,
this ten centimeters of white sand also began to darken. The
concentrations of 0.1% and 0.05% sodium acetate resulted in a
