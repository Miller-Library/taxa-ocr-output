to prevent formation of a darkened sulfide layer. Thompson
(W.C. Thompson, personal communication) has examined the same
stretch of beach chosen for this study for several years. His
observations indicate there is a greater amount of deposition
and erosion with increasing distance from Pier #2. This could
explain the absence of a sulfide layer in transects 5, 6, and 7.
The meiofaunal counts definitely disagree with the pro¬
position that the sulfide layer may be rich in meiofauna. On
the average, the layer was found to contain only 11% of the
number of organisms in the sand above and only 40% of the
classes. This does not vary greatly with the nematode counts
of Perkins (1958) who found in the sulfide layer only 14.6%
of that above. In two cases, counts of Platyhelminthe from the
darkened sand exceeded counts of the sand directly above,
which may be due to a preference, found by Sterrer (1971),
of gnathostomulids for the HoS-rich sand. Perkins (1958)
and Sterrer (1971) both suggest that the meiofauna found in
the layer may be feeding on the bacteria. The sharp decrease
in numbers in the layer shows that the distribution of meiofauna
is affected by some property of the sulfide layer. Polluck
(1971) showed that in several cases meiofaunal distributions
were limited by a lack of oxygen. The presence of HyS in sand
is usually associated with a diminishing supply of oxygen and
may be the limiting factor in distribution. Further invest¬
igation of the actual limiting factor should prove interesting
and further elucidate the affect of sulfide-rich sands on the
sandy beach ecosystem.
