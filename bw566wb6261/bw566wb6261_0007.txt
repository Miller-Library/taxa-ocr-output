black sand in the percolation system while these same concen¬
trations in the stagnant system resulted in medium gray and
light-medium gray. After fifteen days the 0.0% unit had not
darkened. During formation, the layer increased in darkness
with increasing depth, but at the end of fifteen days the
column was a solid black. These experiments are summarized
in Table 1.
Variation in counts of meiofauna was large. See Table 2.
There appears to be an increase in the number of species with
increasing tidal height. The peak occurs at a tidal height of
+6 to +7 feet for the sand above the layer, and at +3 to +4
feet for the sulfide layer. Nematodes were the most wide¬
spread animals both above the sulfide layer, with their peak
being at +4 to +5 feet, and within the layer, with their peak
occurring at 0 to +1 foot in tidal height. Harpacticoid
copepods, collembolids, nereid, juvenile and adult archiannelid
and gpionid annelids were never found in the sulfide layer.
DISCUSSION: Of the three physical parameters studied, it is
felt that wave action is the most important factor governing
formation of a sulfide layer. Wave action affects particle
size, and these two factors in turn can greatly influence the
organic content. Mild wave action can deposit a finer grade
of sand and can allow a greater proportion of the suspended
organic material to settle, whereas, heavy wave action, through
greater turbulence, maintains fine sand and organic material
