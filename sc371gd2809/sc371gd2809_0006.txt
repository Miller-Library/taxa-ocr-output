row was still visible and extending to the first observa-
tion at which the burrow had disappeared. Healing times
varied from 0-10 hours in one Aplidium solidum bur¬
row to 160-170 hours in one Cystodytes lobatus burrow.
Aplidium solidum was consistently the fatest healer, fol-
lowed by Clavelina huntsmani and Cystodytes lobatus in
that order.
The differences in healing times can perhaps be at¬
tributed to two factors, the relative stiffness of the
test and the location of the abandoned burrow to the
zooid systems. Cystodytes lobatus is known to have a
rather stiff test, whereas the tunic of Clavelina hunts-
mani is rather yielding. The test of Aplidium solidum
is somewhat soft and fleshy. In addition, the surface of
the tunic in Aplidium solidum is a very irregular one.
Polycheria osborni often takes advantage of existing
flaps of tunic on this ascidian when creating its bur¬
row and the result is often a relatively shallow de¬
pression in the surface of the test.
Feeding Observations
It has been speculated that the diet of Poly-
cheria osborni consists of detritus and small plants
and animals (Skogsberg and Vansell, 1928). No behavior-
al evidence for the selectivity of food types on the
basis of size or nature of the particles of food has
been reported. Toward this end, tunicates bearing the
amphipod were placed in a fingerbowl that was surrounded
by constantly flowing seawater to maintain temperature
