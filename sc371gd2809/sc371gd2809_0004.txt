ascidian. The colonies of Aplidium solidum that were
available at the time of this study were fairly small,
and the test of this ascidian is not quite as smooth
as that of Cystodytes lobatus. In addition, zooid sys-
tems are very prominent in this ascidian, and pull a¬
way from any physical contact, making it difficult for
Polycheria osborni to settle and burrow. However, a
fairly high percentage of the colonies of this ascidian
(42.9%) were found to be inhabited by the amphipod.
Polycheria osborni was relatively scarce in
Clavelina huntsmani. However, one amphipod was observed
to burrow completely into the tunic within a five minute
period. It is clear that the tunic is a suitable home for
Polycheria osborni yet the amphipod is an infrequent in-
habitant of this ascidian. Although Clavelina huntsmani
is a colonial ascidian, the zooids are not completely em¬
bedded in a common test. Because of this, the surface area
ef the test is distributed in such a way that may make
the amphipods settling on this ascidian relaively dif-
ficult, accounting for its relative scarcity in this asci¬
dian. Fig. 6 pictorially depicts two examples of the ways
in which Polycheria osborni may burrow into the relative-
ly thin test. Small amphipods (up to imm. in length) of-
ten burrow into the distal end of the zooid between the
oral and atrial siphons, while larger specimens (up to 3mm.
in length) have been observed burrowed into the side of
the zooid at an angle, rather than perpendicular to the
vertical axis of the zooid. The distance from the dis-
tal end of the zooid to the furthest point of the bur-
