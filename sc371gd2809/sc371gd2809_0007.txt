at 11-13 °C. The colony was arranged in such a way that
the interior of the burrow and the working of the amphi-
pod's mouth parts could be observed through a dissecting
microscope.
The brown algae Macrocystis pyrifera and Laminaria
sp.and the red algae Gigartina sp. and Gigartina papillata
were ground separately in a blender to yield four dif-
ferent types of detritus. These were then filtered u-
aa
sing Tyler screens to create preparations of particle
sizes. The green algay Cladophora columbiana was
collected in the field as well and used in the feeding
experiments. Brine shrimp larvae and Pollicipes nauplii
were hatched hatched in the lab, and eggs from the asci¬
dian Ascidia ceratodes were taken from that ascidian
using a pipette. Each one of these foods was fed to the
amphipod using a pipette to create a particle-laden cur-
rent of water that passed by the amphipod's burrow at a
reasonably close distance, making it possible for the
amphipod to catch the particles with its antennae. The
foods that Polycheria osborni ingested were noted, and
observations on feeding behavior were made.
Particles of Macrocystis pyrifera and Laminaria sp.
that were up to three times the length of the amphipod's
burrow (up to 5-6 mm.) were taken and eaten. Neither spe-
cies of Gigartina were eaten, although particles of both
were caught and "examined" by Polycheria osborni before
rejection. Cladophora columbiana was rejected similarly.
Both nauplii were caught and ingested. The larger brine
shrimp larvae were trapped in the burrow by the amphi¬
