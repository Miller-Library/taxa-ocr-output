The average number per cm. among the ascidians
which contained Polycheria osborni ranged from O in many
colonies to 1.81 in one colony of Cystodytes lobatus. Fi¬
gures for the maximum number of amphipods per cm.
ranged from O in many colonies to 12, the highest figure
once again being found in Cystodytes lobatus. High va-
lues in both average and maximum numbers per cm.e were
often associated with the presence of many juveniles.
Juvenile burrows measure less than a millimeter long,
whereas those of adults can measure up to 8mm. in length
(Featherstone, 1980). The percent of colonies that were
infested with Polycheria osborni ranged from 12.04% in
Distaplia occidentalis up to 74.4% for Cystodytes lo-
batus.
Fig. 1 summarizes the information on the distribution
of Polycheria osborni at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove. As-
cidian species not included in the list are considered
to be improbable hosts for the amphipod due to their
very small size or to the hardness or heavy sand en¬
crustation of their tunics.
The low numbers of amphipods noted in the examina¬
tion of Distaplia occidentalis may be related to the small
sizes of the colonies examined, and the close proximity
of the zooids to one another within the colony; there is
very little tunic available on which the amphipod can settle.
On the other hand, the colonies of Cystodytes lobatus that
were examined were much larger and presumably older,
and the zooids are less closely packed, allowing
Polycheria osborni more time and space to settle on this
