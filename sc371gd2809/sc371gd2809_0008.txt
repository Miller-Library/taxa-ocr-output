pod closing the burrow with its pereiopods as it has been
reported to do in other circumstances (Skogsberg and Van-
sell, 1928). Ascidia ceratodes eggs were also ingested.
Feeding was observed to take place as described by
Skogsberg and Vansell (1928) and Featherstone (1980).
In addition, the gnathopods were observed to scrape the
pleopods clean and then pass what was gleaned to the mouth
parts, presumably for ingestion. The gnathopods and the
antennae were observed to be capable of reaching out¬
side the burrow to secure a particle of food that had come
to the amphipod's notice.
The behavior associated with the rejection of
particles of algae was similar in each case. Polycheria
osborni grasped the particle with its gnathopods and
turned it over and over while apparently attempting
to feed on it. After having been turned in this manner
a dozen or so times, the unsuitable particle was vi-
gorously rejected from the burrow using the gnathopods
and sometimes kicking it away with the pleopods. My ob-
servations suggested an amphipod must actually examine
a particle carefully and perhaps try to ingest it before
recognizing it either as desirable food or undesirable
matter. This is made evident by the fact that a single

Polycheria osborni eeulbe observed to first eagerly
accept and then reject the same particle in the same
manner several times in succession. Gigartina species
and Cladophora coltmbiana are known to be particularly
tough algae, and were possibly relected for that reason.
During these experiments Polycheria osborni ex¬
