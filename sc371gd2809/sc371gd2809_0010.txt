Summary
1. From April-June, 1981, ascidians collected at Paci¬
fic Grove were examined for the presence of the amphipod
Polycheria osborni.
2. Polycher
ta osborni was found in Aplidium solidum and
Cystodytes lobatus, in addition to several species from
which it is already reported. It was absent in Synoicum
parfustis, Aplidium arenatum and Aplidium propinquum.
3. Healing of burrows vacated by Polycheria osborni was
examined in three ascidians. Aplidium solidum was able
to heal vacated Polycheria osborni burrows fastest,
followed by Clavelina huntsmani and Cystodytes lobatus;
respectively.
4. Polycheria osborni apparently catches potential food
particles unselectively; it appears to examine and at¬
tempt to ingest all particles, thereafter eating some
and rejecting others. Polycheria osborni ingested bar-
nacle and brine shrimp nauplii and ascidian eggs as well
as brown algal detritus. Particles of Cladophora columbiana
and Gigartina sp. were not ingested, possibly owing to
their toughness; they were rejected from the burrow by
use of the gnathopods and/or the pleopods.
5. Polycheria osborni can retain active food organisms
such as nauplii within its burrow by closing the bur-
row opening.
6. Polycheria osborni can use its antennae and gnatho¬
pods to secure food particles lying outside the burrow
on the test of its ascidian host.
7. A second species of gammarid amphipod was discovered
