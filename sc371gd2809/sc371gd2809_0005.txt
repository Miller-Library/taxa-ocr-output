row was measured in ten infested zooids of Clavelina
huntsmani. A value of zero was given to those that had
burrowed into the top of the zooid; the burrow measured
furthest from the distal end was at a distance of 9 mm.
Healing of Abandoned Amphipod Burrows
When an amphipod abandons its burrow, the ascidian
is able to heal the depression left behind in the tunic
(Featherstone, 1980). To investigate this healing abi-
lity quantitatively, Polycheria osborni were removed
from their burrows from specimens of Aplidium solidum,
Clavelina huntsmani, and Cystodytes lobatus using a
pair of fine forceps. Burrow length was measured using
Vernier calipers to within +.125 mm. Burrow length
was used as a measure of amphipod length by Featherstone
(1980); in the present study burrow length was used as
a rough measure of burrow volume. After the amphipods
were removed, the locations of the burrows were marked
using tiny stainless steel pins (minuten nadeln) in
such a way that the tunic would be distorted as little
as possible. The ascidians with amphipods removed were
maintained in a trough of running seawater 38mm. deep.
Seawater flowing through the trough ranged in temperature
11.5 - 13.0°C. Burrows were measured at intervals over
a period of 200 hours until they were no longer recog¬
nizable as burrows and so considered to be completely
healed.
Healing times (Fig. 7) are given as a range in
time beginning at the last observation at which the bur-
