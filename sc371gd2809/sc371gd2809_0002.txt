Distribution and Abundance of Polycheria osborni
Ascidians were collected at low tide at Mussel
Point, using a putty knife to remove them from the sub-
strate. They were taken to the laboratory in plastic bags
and glass jars and examined under a dissecting micro¬
scope for the presence of Polycheria osborni. The areas
of those colonies that were inhabited by Polycheria os-
borni were measured using a transparent plastic grid
marked in square centimeters. The number of amphipods
living in the whole colony was noted as well as the max-
mum number of amphipods that were found living in a
square centimeter. The species that were examined in a
quantitative fashion were Aplidium solidum, Distaplia
occidentalis, Clavelina huntsmani, and Cystodytes lobat-
us;these are species not studied in detail by Feather-
stone (1980).
Information on amphipods in Aplidium arenatum,
Aplidium propimguum and Synoicum parfustis was provided
by Bill Mulroy, who was making a study on the morpho-
logy and taxonomy of these three species. My verification
Wa
of Featherstone's (1980) data yeré obtained in a quali¬
tative manner by examining some samples of those species
for the presence of Polycheria osborni.
All four of those species that were examined quan¬
titatively contained Polycheria osborni; data are shown
ad
in Figs. 2-5. Aplidium arenatum, Aplidium propinquum er-

Synoicum parfustis contained any Polycheria osborni, most
likely due to their having a sand encrusted tunic which
leaves little room for Polycheria osborni to burrow.
