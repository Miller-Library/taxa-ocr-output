hibited no selective behavior with regard to the initial
securing of food particles. The amphipod appears to be
highly opportunistic with respect to feeding, as it ini-
tially reacted enthusiastically to everything fed to it.
Second Species of Gammarid Amphipod
While undertaking the study of the distribution
of Polycheria osborni in the ascidian Aplidium solidum,
a second species of gammarid amphipod was discovered to
be living in She common cloacal cavity of this tunicate.
A small scale distribution study on this amphipod was
done in a manner similar to that done for Polycheria os¬
borni, and some observations were made on the natural his-
tory of this unreported amphipod. Of 73 colonies of Apli¬
dium solidum examined, totalling 959 cm.2, 7 colonies
were infested, and a total number of 10 amphipods were
found.
Thus about 11% of the colonies examined were inha¬
bited by the second amphipod. It uses the common cloacal
cavity as a retreat, but was seen walking about on the
surface of the test, presumably searching for food. It
is not highly specialized morphologically as is Boly-
cheria osborni. An identification of the species is stilj
needed, as the specimens taken during these observations
were juveniles too small to identify with surety.
