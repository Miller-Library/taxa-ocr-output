Introduction
Polycheria osborni is an amphipod of the sub-
order Gammaridea that is known to live in the tunic of
several different species of colonial ascidians. It ranges
in the lower intertidal and subtidal zones from Puget
Sound, Washington to southern California. It was found
in Aplidium (Amaroucium) by Colman (1898), in Clavelina
sp. by Alderman (1936) and in a variety of other asci¬
dians by Abbott and Newberry (1980) and Featherstone
(1980). Its anatomy and some of its behavior were described
by Skogsberg and Vansell (1928). Featherstone (1980) pro-
vided quantitative data on the incidence of Polycheria
osborni and contributed many new observations on its be-
havior. The present study was undertaken to provide ad-
ditional data on the distribution and abundance of the am-
phipod, a quantitative look at the ability of ascidians
to heal a vacated Polycheria osborni burrow, and ob-
servations on the feeding habits of Polycheria osbor-
ni. It also reports the finding of a second species of
commensal gammarid amphipod, this one living in the com¬
mon cloacal cavity of the ascidian Aplidium solidum.
