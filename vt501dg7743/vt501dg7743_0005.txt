Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 6
By photographing adjacent microscope fields while traversing a
section cut through the depth of the sheath, a montage of the
bacterial distribution was prepared (Fig. 5a).
A composite drawing representing a square centimeter of
capsule-sheath viewed edge on, synthesizes the striations visible
in direct light with the layered bacterial distribution apparent
in fluorescence (Fig. 6).
