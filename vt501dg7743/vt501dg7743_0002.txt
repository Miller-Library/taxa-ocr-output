Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 3
INTRODUCTION
After mating, female Loligo opalescens deliver their eggs in
clusters of 100 to 300, covering them in a sheath secreted by
their nidamental glands (Arnold,'71). An ovulating female then
attaches this egg capsule, (Fig. 1), to a large, common egg-mass
built up by several females on sandy substrate (Recksiek and Frey
78). Local divers report little attrition of these egg masses,
and it appears the embryos escape animal, fungal, and microbial
predation during their three to five week incubation. An
interesting predation defense mechanism or mechanisms may exist.
while assessing microbial settlement on the egg capsule
surface in a search for this mechanism, we noticed bodies that
appeared to be bacteria far below the capsule's colonized
surface. We have investigated these bodies and here report the
first instance of an apparently natural deposition/colonization
of bacteria in the sheath of Loligo opalescens egg capsules. We
describe the morphology of the egg-capsule sheath, and detail the
distribution of its bacterial flora with electron and light
microscopy.
