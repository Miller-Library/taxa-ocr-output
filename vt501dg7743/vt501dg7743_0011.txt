Fig. 1. Egg capsules: c-capsule, e-eggs, s-sheath. The capsule
on the right has been opened and its contents pulled away from
the sheath.
Fig. 2. Histological staining of 3 micron sections of freshly
laid capsule's sheath show regular striations at 1000x total
magnification. Their spacing at 10 to 20 microns implies roughly
100 layers in total.
Fig. 3. Bacillus bacteria midway through the depth of the sheath
covering a freshly laid capsule - 45,000x.
Fig. 4. A shorter rod (a), and the common fusiform morphology (b)
midway through the depth of the sheath - 45,000x.
Fig. 5a - The vertical bar represents a typical bacterial
distribution through the 2 mm depth of the capsule sheath. The
water is above/outside, and the eggs below/inside. Distribution
of bacteria is distinctly layered. The dark rectangle corresponds
to figure 5b. 5b - A typical fluorescence photomicrograph used to
map the bacterial distribution depicted in whole in 5a. This is a
border between regions of high and low bacterial density,
Fusiform sheath bacteria are evident below, stained with DAPI and
viewed at 1000x magnification in this optical section through the
depth of the sheath.
Fig. 6. Striations visible in light microscopy, combined with the
fluorescence distribution transect, yield a composite structure:
a matrix of fine striations bearing thick, bacteria-laden layers,
The dark rectangles, A and B, correspond to figure 2 and figure
5b respectively.
