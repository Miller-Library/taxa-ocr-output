Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 5
RESULTS
Sheath Structure
The sheath is a tough, acellular matrix one to two
millimeters thick which completely encapsulates the eggs (Fig,
In light and electron microscopy its most obvious structural
features are numerous, thin striations parallel to the capsule
surface (Fig. 2). These striations, which stain darkly with
Lee's-methylene-blue-basic-fuchsin in light microscopy, are also
stained by uranyl-acetate in samples prepared for transmission
electron microscopy. Both results suggest that these are areas
high in protein content. The striations are roughly 3 microns
thick, 10 to 20 microns apart. We estimate that the sheath, at
1000 to 2000 microns thickness, contains roughly 100 of these
striated layers.
Sheath Bacteria
In addition to striations, light microscopy also reveals
bacteria-sized bodies deep within the capsule sheath (Fig, 2).
Transmission electron microscopy further reveals morphologies
which strongly suggest bacteria (Figs. 3, 4). Fluorescence
microscopy of samples stained with the DNA-specific dye DAPI
confirms that these bodies contain genetic material and are
therefore most likely bacteria (Fig. 5b).
In electron and light microscopy a fusiform bacteria is
consistently in high abundance, even in capsules less than six
hours old. It stains positively with acridine orange and DAPI,
and is present in the sheath of all the capsules we have examined
to date (Figs. 4, 5b).
The distribution of bacteria through the depth of the
capsule sheath, as assessed by optical sections stained
fluorescently for DNA, appears to be non-random. One to five
densely populated layers, in which bacteria may comprise as much
as ten percent of the volume of the sheath matrix, alternate with
layers which are nearly or completely free of bacteria.
