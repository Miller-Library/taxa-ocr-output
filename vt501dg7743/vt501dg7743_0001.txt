Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 2
ABSTRACT
The egg capsule sheath of the squid Loligo opalescens is an
acellular matrix 1-2 mm thick which contains roughly 100 thin
striations in layers parallel to the capsule surface. In this
matrix is suspended a dense culture of bacteria in one to five
layers. Its probable source is the accessory nidamental gland.
