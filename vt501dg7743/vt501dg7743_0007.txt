Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 8
This phenomenon is not unprecedented. Early investigators of
bacteria in the accessory nidamental glands of bioluminescent
squid (Pierantoni '14, '18), (Herfurth '36), (as cited in Buchner
65) noted bacteria in the egg capsule sheaths of three squid:
Loligo edulis, Loligo forbesi, and Sepia officinalis. These
investigators also looked on the accessory nidamental gland as
the most likely source for the sheath bacteria,
Function
Function of egg capsule sheath bacteria is perhaps the most
interesting question raised by this study. A likely pezibliig is
defense of the developing embryos. Loligo opalescens' eggs are
laid in large masses which appear to suffer little animal,
fungal, or microbial attrition. Sheath bacteria offer a possible
explanation for this predation resistance. Instances of natural
flora discouraging colonization by pathogenic organisms have long
been established (Zobell '46).
Sheath bacteria might populate layers of the capsule sheath
so heavily that all available resources are exhausted to the
detriment of pathogenic organisms. It is also possible that the
bacteria do not "passively compete" but actively produce an
antibiotic compound. A symbiosis of this type has been noted in a
crustacean's eggs, in which a bacteria of the genus Alteromonas
protects embryos by producing the fungicide isatin (Fisher '83,
Gil-Turnes, Hay, and Fenical '89).
If "embryo protection" is actually a role of sheath
bacteria, it may not be the only element in the capsule with this
function. Atkinson ('68, '73) has demonstrated an "immobilizing
factor" in the nidamental gland secretions which form the capsule
sheath. This factor agglutinates the cilia of motile metazoans,
and may inhibit protozoan predators of the egg capsule. Sheath
bacteria, in conjunction with "immobilizing factor" might
constitute an interesting system of embryonic defense.
