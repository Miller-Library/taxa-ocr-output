Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 4
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General: Squid were captured in Monterey Bay, held in 2000
liter, circular holding tanks with constant flow, and induced to
mate by artificial egg masses (Yang, '83)
Electron Microscopy: After opening freshly laid (age Â«6 hrs)
capsules longitudinally and removing the chorions and embryos
with sterile forceps (Fig. 1), samples of the capsule-sheath were
fixed in glutaraldehyde (22 in sterile sea water for 2 hrs),
treated with osmium tetroxide (12 in sterile water adjusted to
oceanic salinity and pH), stained with uranyl-acetate (1 hr at
12, as for osmium tetroxide), serially dehydrated in acetone (20-
1002 in 102 steps), then set in Spurr's plastic (Spurr '69). This
block was then sectioned to 800 Angstroms in planes perpendicular
to the surface of the capsule, and examined on a Phillips 201
electron microscope at 80 ky.
Light Microscopy: The transmission EM protocol described
above was followed until the sample had been set in Spurr's
plastic. The sample was then sectioned to 3 microns in planes
perpendicular to the surface of the capsule, stained with Lee's
methylene-blue basic-fuchsin, and examined at 1000x total
magnification under oil.
Bacterial Distribution: The capsule sheath was separated
from the embryos and chorions (Fig. 1), then sectioned in 0.5 mm
planes perpendicular to the surface of the capsule. To minimize
extraneous bacteria all implements and surfaces in contact with
the capsule were sterilized for 10 minutes with 952 ethanol,
Samples were then stained with acridine orange (1 ug/ml: 10
minutes stain, 10 minutes wash in sterile sea water) or the DNA
specific stain DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole diluted 1 to
1000 in sterile sea water, 20 min stain, 20 min wash in sterile
sea water), and examined at 1000x total magnification with UV
excitation. By photographing adjacent microscope fields while
traversing samples, photo-montages which transected the depth of
the capsule-sheath were prepared.
