Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 9
Generality
Already noted in the egg capsule sheaths of three
bioluminescent squid (Buchner '65), and now a non-bioluminescent
squid (Biggs and Epel '90), egg capsule sheath bacteria may be a
more general phenomenon than previously suspected. Marine
bacteria have also been found in association with the eggs of a
scaphapod (Geilenkirchen, Timmermans, Van Dongen, and Arnolds,
70), and even a crustacean (Fisher, '83).
In the cephalopods investigated so far, it appears sheath
bacteria are derived from the accessory nidamental gland. Since
this organ is common in squid and cuttlefish, it is conceivable
that further investigation will reveal other instances of
accessory nidamental gland-derived sheath bacteria. If so, the
function of accessory nidamental gland bacteria, which has
remained elusive in adults (Bloodgood '77), might become evident
in the context of the capsule sheath.
