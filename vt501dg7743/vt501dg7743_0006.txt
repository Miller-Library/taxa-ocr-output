Egg Capsule Sheath Bacteria - 7
DISCUSSION
Our observations indicate that the one to two millimeter
thickness of the egg capsule sheath contains roughly 100
striations, probably proteinaceous, and one to five densely
populated layers of bacteria. Bacteria in organized layers
abundant even in capsules less than six hours old, raise
questions of origin, function, and generality.
Origin
If work on Loligo pealei, an Atlantic squid, can be
generalized to the Pacific Loligo opalescens, a likely source for
the sheath bacteria is the female squid's accessory nidamental
gland. In many species of cuttlefish and squid this paired organ
of sexually mature females opens onto the mantle cavity, which
serves the organism as an oviduct (Williams '09), (Buchner '65).
Studies of L. pealei by Bloodgood ('77) reveal that the
accessory nidamental gland derives its mottled appearance from
internal convoluted tubules, which harbor one of three distinct
cultures of bacteria (one of which produces a sepiaxanthin-like
pigment responsible for the gland's color). Bloodgood's
investigations further show the gland has musculature permitting
it peristaltic movement and is contractile upon dissection from
the squid. His results also suggest that the gland secretes a
medium on which the bacteria grow.
while the capsule sheath is secreted primarily by the
nidamental glands, (Arnold '71), the duct opening of the
accessory nidamental gland suggests that it may also contribute
to formation of the capsule. Our results suggest that its
contribution could include bacteria. Perhaps the accessory
nidamental gland contracts during formation of the egg capsule,
periodically expressing its bacterial contents into the sheath,
This would account not only for the layered distribution, but
also for the abundance of bacteria in newly laid capsules.
