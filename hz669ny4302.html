ABSTRACT
The impact of the introduced mudflat grazer, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Badillaris attramentaria</span>
on the ecosystem in Elkhorn Slough was studied by building cages to exclude
the snails from plots of sediment. Sediment samples were collected from the
exclosures and from controls areas where snails were present. These
samples were then analyzed for chlorophyll a concentration as a measure of
diatom productivity. The high variation within the environment, both
spatially and temporally, obscured the effects of the snails. Therefore, the
population dynamics of the diatoms must first be elucidated before the
effects of the snails can be determined.
INTRODUCTION
For centuries humans have played a key role in facilitating the spread
of numerous alien species to new environments throughout the world. Many
of the terrestrial introductions were preconceived for the alteration of an
ecosystem. Exotic marine organisme, however, have usually been
inadvertently transported by various means. Wooden ships were ideal
environments for the transfer of species of anemones, barnacles, mollusks,
algae, snails, and other rugged organisms that could survive harch conditions
(Cariton 1989). Ballast water was also an important means by which alien
species were introduced thousands of miles away. When a ship completed a
journey, the ballast water would be pumped into the new harbor. The
emergence of commercial oyster farming played a key role in the invasion
by species closely associated with the oysters. Charles Elton, one of the first
scientists to become concerned about the homogenization of the earth's
species composition, suggested that, 'the greatest agency of all that spreads
marine animals to new quarters of the world must be the business of oyster
culture" (Elton 1958).
Introduced species have been demonstrated to have a profound effect
on the ecosystems which they invade. Such species can cause alterations in
nutrient and water cycles (Egunjobi and Onweluzo 1979, Weetman, et al.
1980), frequency of natural disturbances such as floods and fires (Smith
1985), and soil structure (Hodgkin 1984). Vitousek (1986) has concluded
that individual species can have a profound effect on the ecosystems that
they invade.
The role of grazers in the structure of intertidal and benthic
communities has been studied in a number of organiems. Grazing herbivores
such as gastropods and polychaete worms primarily affect the succession
and species composition of the microflora (Bianchi and Rice 1988). This
effect has been shown to be especially apparent in the rocky intertidal zone
(Lubchenco 1978). Even though invasions in soft-sediment marine
communities are much more common, they are not well understood. The
physical environment is highly variable and is, therefore, much more
difficult to study (Wilson 1991). Laboratory studies suggest that grazing at
à minimal level may actually have a positive effect on benthic diatom
populations, while larger grazing pressure results in a suppression of algal
productivity (Connor, et al. 1982). This stimulation may be the result of
stirring of the sediments and thus revealing increased nutrients to surface
species.
The mud snail, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Batillaria attramentaria : Exact'>Batillaria attramentaria</span> (Sowerby), was introduced to
North America as early as 1923 (Whitlatch and Obrebski 1980). The species
is native to Japan and was accidentally brought through the oyster farming
industry to the West Coast of the Northern United States and Canada.
Fatillaria live in close association with the oyster, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Gassostrea gigas</span>
(Thunberg, 1793). The first evidence of an established population of the
snail was in 1951 (McLean 1960). There are currently two locations where
such snail populations have been found in the state of California: one in
Tomales Bay and the other in Elkhorn Slough. Preliminary studies on
reproduction suggest that the snails have no pelagic stage in their life cycle,
thus minimizing their dispersal ability. This information could be important
in explaining the reason for their lack of expansion past the areas where
they were introduced, despite suitable habitat availability.
Batillaria are found in numbers exceeding 300 per square meter and
are capable moving up to twenty meters in a month. Intestinal analysis has
suggested that their main sources of food are benthic diatoms (Whitlatch and
Obrebski 1980). As a result this species is capable of greatly impacting the
environment into which it has been introduced. The populations are
typically found in mudflats and marsh creeks where there is a high
concentration of diatoms. Elkhorn Slough does not support any native
mudflat snails so Batillaria is the only gastropod present that feeds on
benthic diatoms. Therefore, the introduction of this species could have a
dramatic impact on the distribution and productivity of the diatoms that
they feed upon. This is an experimental study of the grazing effects of
Batillaria attramentaria on the mudflat ecosystem, using chlorophyll a
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiment A
The experiment was conducted in the Elkhorn Slough in Watsonville,
California. The research area was located in a mudflat area north of the area
known locally as 'the Island.“ The area has a gentle slope which is high on
the edges and in the middle, forming a shallow depression that is rarely
exposed. The area is exposed to direct sunlight throughout the day. The
edge of the selected area is surrounded by a dense patch of pickleweed, and
Badllaria were observed in the midst of the patches. Eighteen plots were
haphazardly selected throughout the study site and were randomly assigned
one of three experimental conditions. Six plots were used as controis and
were marked off at the corners with dowels as a 20 cm by 20 cm area. Six
plots were experimental cages (also 20 cm x 20 cm) with screen wrapped
around four dowels at the corners. The screen was 10 cm high and was
submerged 2 cm into the sediment to prevent the snails from burrowing
underneath the exclosures. Six plots were used as controls for the effects of
cage materials and structure, with two sides bordered with screen and two
sides exposed to let the snails enter and exit freely. Three of these cages
were set up parallel to the incoming tide, and three of them were set up
perpendicular. Ten samples of sediment were collected throughout the
eighteen plots to get an estimate of the chlorophyll concentration in the area
After twelve days there was a noticeable layer of film inside the exclosure
cages and also within some of the cage controls. A 3.5 cm in diameter
sample of the top centimeter of sediment was collected in the center of each
plot. These samples were brought back to the lab and transferred to new
containers. 11 mL of acetone were added to each vial, and the sediments
were kept in darkness in the 4° Celcius room for 48 hours. One mL of
solution was removed from each sample and placed in a microfuge tube. The
samples were centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the absorbance of
chlorophyll a was measured with a spectrophotometer. The wavelength
readings were collected at the following: 664.0 nm, 647.0 nm, 630.0 nm.
Eight days later I collected two samples from each of the cages, one
from the center of the plot and the other on the side. At the same time
another set of eighteen plots were constructed nearby as a replication of
the first experiment. Seven days following the start of the second
replication, sediments were collected from both sets of plots. The above
sédiment analysis was repeated on each of the samples in the laboratory.
Data analysis
The chlorophyll a concentration was computed by the following
equation (Hansmann 1983):
chlorophyll a (ug/mL) =11.85 (664) -1.54 (D647) - 0.08 (D630).
Experiment B
A similar area of mudflat was discovered close to the study site of
experiment. Careful searching revealed seven living specimens of Batillaria
scattered over an area comparable in size to the study site where there were
hundreds of thousands of snails. In order to try to elucidate the reason for
the low numbers of snails, 35 snails were marked, and a notch was made in
the shell in order to keep track of shell growth. Specimens were notched
and returned to the mudflat used in experiment as a control for snail
growth.
RESULTS
Experiment A
Figure 1 shows the difference in chlorophyll a concentration between
the initial samples and those collected after the experiment continued for a
period of seven days. In all cases, the error bars show that there is no
observable heterogeneity between the three treatments. Figure 2 displays
the fluctuation of the average snail counts through time. Table 1 shows the
actual values within the different plots and demonstrates the erratic snail
numbers within single plots. Figures 3 through 5 show that variation within
the plots also was not heterogeneous. A comparison of average chlorophyll a
concentrations between samples taken at the center of the plots to samples
taken on the side edges shows no observable difference between the three
treatments. The average center trends were all lower than the average side
trends.
Experiment B
The snails that were introduced into the sparsely populated mudflat
area all disappeared after two days. None were recovered, and subsequent
observations of the area revealed no snails, either living or dead.
DISCUSSION
The spatial and temporal variation within the mudflat environment
was unpredictable and highly fluctuating. The results show that the snail
populations between and among plots differed greatly and that the
chlorophyll concentrations were not noticeably correlated with these
variations. The fluctuations within the treatments were so large that any
possible differences between treatments were obscured. The reasons for
such variation are unknown, since the patchy environment did not appear to
follow any pattern or gradient that would explain the differences in
chlorophyll a concentration. As a result, it can not be asserted that the
exclosure condition either had an effect or did not have an effect.
The samples from the center of plots were consistently lower than the
side averages. This observation suggests a possible edge effect due to the
actual cage structure. There might have been water current alterations due
to the physical obstruction of the cage that encouraged diatom productivity
in certain areas around the edge of the plot. Such observations might also
have been due to some impact of the cages on the snail populations. These
results are somewhat unexpected since the shade provided by the cage walls
reduced the sunlight reaching the diatoms around the edge of the plots. This
was not the case in the control plots since there were no walls constructed
but was a factor only for the cage controls and the experimental plots.
Further investigation of the variation within the mudflat might help to
sort out the differences between the environmental variation and changes
due to the experimental conditions. Daily counts of the snails within the
xperimental plots and frequent collection of sediment would give a more
exact view of the day to day conditions in the area. From these data, trends
might emerge which would link the snail fluctuations with varying
chlorophyll a concentrations. Snail enclosures could also be established
which would maintain fixed densities within the plots. From this test, the
effect of fluctuating snail population would be controlled. In addition, the
density of snails could be varied to determine whether low populations of
snails improve the productivity of diatoms by stirring up nutrients beneath
the surface of the sediment and increasing nutrient cycling
Determining the actual diatom species composition within the
different experimental conditions would help to discover the species that the
snails are digesting. The experimental plots might have low concentrations
of diatoms that the snails are feeding on, while other species are
compensating for this gap by increasing their productivity. If this were
observed, then the snails would be altering the competitive interactions
among the various diatom species. This effect would not be observable in
basic chlorophyll a measurements, but microscopy analysis would make such
differences obvious.
The effects of introduced species to the rocky intertidal zone are often
quite obvious and straightforward (Lubchenco and Menge 1978). The
intertidal zone is a harsh environment and has, therefore, developed a
complex network of interactions among the native species living there. As a
result, the successful invasion of an alien species is more likely to have a
profound effect on the structuring of the intertidal ecosystem. Nutrient
supplies are unpredictable, and species often develop highly specific habitat
requirements which are easily disrupted by the introduction of a new
species. The soft-sediment environment, while a more abundant type of
écosystem, is much less understood and not as well studied. The conditions
that the species in the soft-sediment must overcome are vastly different
from the challenges of the rocky intertidal. Therefore, the impacts of
invasion species in the mudflat can not necessarily be assumed the same as
the impacts in the intertidal zone. As a result the spatial and temporal
variation within this environment must be studied and understood before
such impacts can be determined.
The results from the transplant experiment further emphasize the
high variability within the Elkhorn Slough ecosystem. Not only is there high
variation within a single mudflat region, but the disappearance of all the
snails when transferred to a seemingly analogous environment suggests high
variability on a larger scale.
The introduction of Batillaria attramentaria into Elkhorn Slough made
it the first mudflat-grazing gastropod in the marsh. As a result there was no
direct competition between this species and another closely related species.
The snails were quite successful in the mudflat, with an average population
of 350 m-2. This success suggests that there was possibly an available niche
to be filled by this snail. However, this indication can not be accepted with
any certainty since the actual effect of the snails on the rest of the ecosystem
could not be determined. The diatoms have obviously not been decimated
by the snails, and it is possible that the snails actually encourage diatom
productivity. Some research suggests that mud snails stir up the sediment
and increase nutrient cycling (Connor, et al. 1982). The effect of Batillaria
in Elkhorn Slough has not been determined and must be investigated
further. Future studies on the effects of grazing must focus on the
population dynamics of the diatoms. The effects of varying light conditions,
salinity, tides, and sediment content all need to be addressed.
