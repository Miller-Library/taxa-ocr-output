Results
Electrophoretic separation of T. californicus DNA on a one percent
agarose gel revealed a single distinct band at about 20 kilobases. The same
separation performed on RNA gave three distinct bands.
The T. californicus genomic DNA digested with three restriction
enzymes EcoRV, EcoRl, and Pstl resulted in different degrees of digestion.
EcoRV digested more completely revealing a smeared DNA band where as
Pstl and EcoRl were less effective with their corresponding bands being more
distinct. The sharpness of the bands indicate that the DNA was in relatively
larger fragments (figure 3).
Following hybridization of the P-32 labeled UBM probe to the digested
genomic T. californicus DNA and exposure to X-ray film for 18 hrs, at least
three distinct bands were seen on the resulting autoradiograph. A
reproduction of the autoradiograph is not included due to its low resolution.
A fragment of about 310 base pairs was observed when PCR products
and the restricted vector with fragment insert were separated on a two percent
agarose gel by electrophoresis. (figure 4 and 5). The sequencing of this
fragment resulted in the sequence given in figure 6.
The obtained DNA sequence was translated into an amino acid
sequence and is shown in figure 7 with the yeast UBC4 and ÃœBC5 amino acid
sequence. Table I gives the percent of amino acid identity between the
sequenced fragment from T. Californicus and the yeast UBC4 and UBC5
amino acid sequences.
