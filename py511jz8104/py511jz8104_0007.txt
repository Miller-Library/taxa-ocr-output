Discussion
T. californicus is an ideal organism in which to study the effects of
stress on the expression of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. This is true for
several reasons. First, both high molecular weight DNA and intact RNA are
efficiently isolated with good yield and purity. In figure 1 the uppermost
band of the molecular weight marker labeled M is 21.7 kilobases. The three
juxtaposed bands to the right are T. Californicus DNA and are estimated to be
roughly 19 kilobases. In addition to being relatively long, the DNA also
appears as sharp, distinct bands indicating a high degree of purity. Figure 2
shows that the RNA has similar characteristics. The ribosomal bands are
fairly distinct indicating the RNA is both pure and intact. Efficient isolation
of RNA that has not been degraded is a critical step in Northern blot analysis
which can be used to characterize the nature of ÃœBCTI expression.
Southern blot analysis confirmed that ubiquitin was present in T.
Californicus. The autoradiograph of T. californicus DNA in the EcORV
restriction that was hybridized with the UBM probe from C. reinhardtii
showed at least three bands, thus providing strong evidence that at least three
genes coding for ubiquitin exist in T. californicus. This conclusion assumes
that the probe hybridized with only intact genes or that the restriction enzyme
did not cut within an ubiquitin coding region. Restricting the genomic DNA
with more restriction enzymes will reveal the plausibility of these
assumptions. The discovery of ubiquitin genes in T. californicus is not
surprising, however, considering that all eukaryotes studied thus far possess
the ubiquitin system. The poor resolution of the autoradiograph prevented
its reproduction for this paper.
