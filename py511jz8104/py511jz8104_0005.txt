deoxynucleosides triphosphates, 25 nmol of MgCl2, 5 ul of Taq polymeraseloX
Buffer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The products were precipitated
overnight with 0.1 volume sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol and
resuspended in 20 ul of sterile water. A 5 ul sample was run on a two percent
agarose gel to confirm amplification of a fragment of the expected size,
roughly 309 base pairs. The product was then run on a two percent low-
melting agarose gel and bands at 309 base pairs were cut and eluted using the
Magic PCR Mini-Prep Kit (Promega).
The fragment was then inserted into pBluescript SK+ vectors
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which had been restricted with EcoRV, by blunt end
ligation. Transformation into the XLI-Blue strain of E. coli was performed
according to standard methods (Maniatis, 1982). After proliferation, the
vector with the inserted fragment was isolated from XLI-Blue using the Magic
Maxi-Prep Kit (Promega). A sample of the vector was restricted with BamHI
and Sall (Promega) and run on a one percent agarose gel to confirm that
amplification was successful.
The inserted fragment was sequenced using Sequenase 2.0 from US
Biochemicals (Cleveland, Ã–H) and T3, T7(Promega), and -40 Universal (US
Biochemicals) primers. Sequenase 2.0 products were run on a 6%
polyacrylamide gel and bands were visualized by autoradiography (Kodak
XAR-5 film). Analysis of sequence was performed using the Genalign, Sec
and Gened programs from Intelligenetics (Mountain View, CA). The
sequence was first translated into an amino acid sequence and then compared
to the UBC4 and UBC5 amino acid sequences of the yeast S. cerevisiae.
