Blot method (Dr. Jan von Kampen, personal communication). Once the
DNA was denatured the transfer was performed by sandwiching the gel with
Whatman paper 3mm and Hybond N+ Nylon membrane (Amersham) on
one side and four sheets of Whatman paper 3mm on the other. The stack
was then placed on a gel dryer with the nylon membrane below the gel and
dried at 80° C until the gel was flat. The DNA was fixed by baking at 80° C for
two hours. The DNA was probed with a P-32 labeled ubiquitin gene(ÜBM)
from C. reinhardtii, kindly provided by Dr. Jan von Kampen. The nylon
membrane was then exposed on X-ray film (Kodak XAR-5 Rochester, NY) for
18 hours and then developed.
Gene cloning and analysis. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
performed using isolated T. californicus genomic DNA and two degenerate
oligodeoxynucleotide primer:
OCP9 15' GAGGATCCTA(T,C)GA(A,G)GG(T,A)GG(T,A)GT(TOTT(TCTT 3"
Dj2 I5' CTGTCGACAC(A,G,C,T)GC(G,A)TA(CTTT(CTTT(A,GCTGTCCA
(C.T)TC 3’] (Oligo's Etc., Gilford, CT)
The primers were developed from the conserved regions of UBC4 and UBC5
in yeast and ÜbcDl in Drosophila (Zhen et al., 1993). The PCR was performed
in 100 ul reaction mixtures containing 400 ng of genomic DNA, 500 pmol of
each primer, 10 ul of Taq polymerase 10X Buffer (Promega), 1 nmol of each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), and 0.25
umoles of MgCl2. The amplification consisted of 35 cycles of 94° C for 30
seconds, 55° C for 90 seconds, and 72° C for 90 seconds followed by a 10
minute incubation at 72° C. The product was precipitated overnight with 0.1
volume ammonium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol and resuspended in 20
ul of sterile water. A second PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 ul
containing 15 ul of resuspended DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 5 nmol of each
