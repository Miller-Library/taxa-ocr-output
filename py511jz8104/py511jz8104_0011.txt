Figure 1. One percent agarose gel of isolated DNA from T. Californicus.
Upper band of M is 2
1.7 kb and next band is 5..15 kb. Lanes 1, 2, 3 are DNA in
increasing concentration.
Figure 2. One percent agarose gel of isolated RNA from T. Californicus. On
original distinct bands can be visualized.
Figure 3. One percent agarose gel of restricted DNA. The uppermost band of
Mis 21.7 kb. The EcoRV restricted the best showing the most diffuse band of
the three restriction enzymes.
Figure 4. Two percent agarose gel of PCR products. The lower four bands of
the 1 kb standard are 506, 516 bases, 396 bases, 344 bases, and 295 bases. The
two circled fragments are UBCTI.
Figure 5. Two percent agarose gel of vector restricted by BamHI and Sall. The
lower four bands of the 1 kb marker are 506, 516 bases, 396 bases, 344 bases, and
295 bases. The circled fragment in lane five is UBCTI. The upper bands are
the vector in super-coiled, nicked, and linear form.
Figure 6. Sequence of cloned fragment. The ends of the sequence correspond
to the base pairs of the primers indicating that the primed fragment was
sequenced.
Figure 7. The sequence of the cloned fragment that has been translated into
an amino acid sequence. T. Californicus sequence is on top followed by UBC4
and UBC5. Lines indicate homology between sequences.
Table I. The percent amino acid identity between the the yeast UBC4 and
UBC5 sequence and the T. californicus UBCTI sequence.
