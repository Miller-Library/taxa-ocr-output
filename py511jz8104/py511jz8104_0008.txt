Having established the existence of ubiquitin in T. californicus, the
presence of at least one gene coding for ubiquitin-conjugated enzyme was
very likely. The primers OCP9 and Dj2 prime for a conserved ubiquitin¬
conjugating enzyme coding region in yeast UBC4 and ÜBC5 and ÜbcDl in
Drosophila that is roughly 309 base pairs long. Figure 4 shows the products of
the PCR separated by two percent agarose gel electrophoresis. The expected
fragment can be seen to be roughly 309 base pairs. Following cloning,
restriction of the vector revealed a fragment again at 309 base pairs, indicating
successful cloning (figure 5 - lane 5 from the right.).
Final confirmation that the T. californicus homologue of yeast UBC4
and UBC5 had been cloned was established by elucidating the DNA sequence.
Each end of the cloned fragment was identical to the sequence of the primer
used for PCR indicating that the isolation and cloning was successful in
amplifying UBCTI (see figure 6.). Comparison of the amino acid sequences
shows a remarkable level of amino acid identity. Of particular interest is the
region circled in figure 7. The cystine residue in this portion of the sequence is
crucial for the ubiquitin-UBC thioester bond and the catalytic core of E2's
(Finley and Chau, 1991). The complete amino acid identity in this region is
further indication that the gene sequenced is a homologue of the yeast UBC4
and UBC5 genes.
The high degree of conservation between yeast UBC4 and UBC5 and
UBCTI suggest that ÜBCTI expression can also be induced by heat shock and
other stresses. Further examination of this question by Northern blot analysis
of RNA isolated from T. californicus subjected to various stresses such as
salinity and temperature is needed to confirm this hypothesis. This study has
established T. californicus as a marine organism that is amenable to further
