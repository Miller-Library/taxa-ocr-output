cloning and sequencing of the first UBC discovered in this marine organism,
UBCTI.
Materials and Methods
Collecting T. californicus. T. californicus were collected from a high
splash pool behind the Jacques Loeb building at Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove, CA. The specimens were captured by using a tea strainer and
held at room temperature in 18" x 11" x 6" Tupperware containers filled with
filtered sea water. The animals were fed three times a week with ground
mussels provided by Dr. George Matsumoto (Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, CA). New specimens were collected every two weeks.
Isolation of DNA. Specimens were concentrated by in a 15 mL
polypropylene Falcon tube until they filled about 5 mL. After concentration,
they were anesthetized with 90% ethanol and isolation of DNA was
performed following a protocol used in study of the ubiquitin system in the
green algaeChlamydomonas reinhardtii (Dr. Jan von Kampen, personal
communication).
Isolation of RNA. Isolation of T. californicus RNA was performed
following a protocol used for isolation of sodium channel mRNA from rat
skeletal muscle (Cooperman, S. S. et al., 1987).
Southern Blot. Isolated genomic T. californicus DNA was restricted by
Pstl, EcoRl, and EcoRV restriction enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI). The
restricted DNA was run on a one percent agarose with a Lambda DNA ladder
(Promega). The DNA was transferred onto a sheet of Hybond H+ Nylon
Membrane (Amersham Arlington Heights, IL) by the Innovative Southern
