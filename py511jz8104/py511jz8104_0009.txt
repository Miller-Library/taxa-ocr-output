investigation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and the ubiquitin system and
their relationship to heat shock and stress response.
Acknowledgments
I am indebted to Dr. Jan von Kampen and Julie Golden for their patience and
guidance. I thank Greg Ha for the outdoor adventures and for being a partnei
in "harshing" on our lab mates. I also thank Christine Shin and Theresa
McEvoy for their comic relief and taking the "harshing" without retaliation. 1
am eternally grateful to Dr. R. Paul Levine for providing me the opportunity
to study under his tutelage and for assembling one of the finest labs at
Hopkins Marine Station.
