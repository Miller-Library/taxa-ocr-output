ubiquitin which eventually binds to the protein to be tagged. The E2's,
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (ÜBC's), confer specificity to the ubiquitin
system by leading ubiquitin to the protein to be targeted. The E3's, ubiquitin¬
protein ligases, act to ligate ubiquitin to selected proteins and are also
involved in conjugating a chain of ubiquitin to a monoubiquinated protein
(V. Kampen, J. and M. Wettern, 1992).
This paper is concerned with the stress function of the ubiquitin system
and is focused on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. In the yeast S. cerevisiae
ten UBC genes have been sequenced and studied. The expression of two of
these genes, UBC4 and UBC5, is induced by heat shock and is involved in the
stress response. Yeast ubcaubc5 double mutants show an inability to survive
high temperatures or in the presence of an amino acid analog that causes
abnormal protein synthesis. In addition, loss of UBC4 and UBC5 function
induces the stress response in yeast (Jentsch and Seufert, 1990)
The copepod Tigriopus californicus is an ideal organism for studying
stress as its life in the high splash pools of the western coastline subject it
wide temperature and salinity fluctuations. The survival of this species
depends on its tolerance of conditions in which predators cannot survive. It
can withstand salinities of up to six times that of normal sea water and
temperatures of up to 40° C. In addition to its ability to cope with a range of
conditions, it is a hardy animal that is easily maintained in the laboratory and
is found in abundance along the California Coastline (Haderlie et al., 1980).
The expression of UBC4 and UBC5 in yeast has been shown to be
induced by stress, and the synthesis of a family of heat shock proteins (HSP's),
the HSP 60's, in T. Californicus is inducible by temperature and salinity stress
(G. Ha and T. McEvoy, personal communication). The results presented here
lay the foundation for study of UBC's in T. Californicus by reporting on the
