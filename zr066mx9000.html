Abstract
Citharichthys stigmaeus of a first year class
population were analyzed by gas chromatography to
determine the concentration of DDT residues in var-
ious tissues. Liver contained 2.6 ppm DDE (wet weight).
Gut and brain tissue contained 0.3 and 0.23 ppm re-
spectively, while gills and muscle had lower concen-
trations of 0.073 and 0.064 ppm DDE.
In uptake experiments, fish were incubated in 1 ppb
C14-labeled DDT for various times up to 36 hours. Ap-
preciable label was found in all tissues after 30 minutes,
increasing to high concentrations in the liver, gut and
brain after 24 hours. Lower, but significant uptake
was found in the skin, gills and muscle.
Fish pulsed for 4 hours in 1 ppb CDDT and sub-
sequently transferred to natural sea water provided data
on DDT excretion. Gills averaged a 90% loss of the initial
pulse label, while skin, liver, gut, brain and muscle
retained 80 - 110% of the DDT after a 72 hour incubation.

Introduction
The speckled sanddab is a carnivorous, benthic,
marine fish, with a range along the Pacific coast of
North America from Baja California to southeastern Al-
aska. It probably feeds on small benthic invertebrates
such as worms, clams, crabs and shrimps (Baxter, 1960
and Ginsberg, 1952). The sanddab lives in contact
with the bottom and is often buried just below the sand
so that only its eyes are above the substrate. Because
of this close relationship with the bottom it is expected
that this species, and flatfish in general, would be
exposed to much higher levels of DDT residues than pel-
agic fish. The low solubility of DDT residues in water
(Bowman, 1960) may cause thesespesticides to accumulate
within the sediments adsorbed to particulate matter.
A study by the California Department of Fish and Game
(Odemar, 1968) has shown DDT residue levels in marine
bottom sediments to be 9 - 19 ppb, approximately 2800
times greater than concentrations in sea water.
The sanddab was chosen for this investigation be-
cause of its benthic niche and presumably high exposure
to pesticide residues, for its position near the top of
the benthic food web, and for its commercial importance
as a food fish. The species lends itself to experimen-
tation because of its great abundance in the shallow
waters of southern Monterey Bay, small size, ease of
adaptibility to experimental conditions and wide variety
of foods.
Gas chromatographic analyses have been made by
Risebrough (1968, in press) for the English sole from
Monterey Bay in which he found 0.76 ppm total DDT.
Odemar (1968) found DDE levels in the starry flounder
from Monterey Bay of 0.284 ppm. In this investigation,
in addition to an analysis of the ambient levels of DDT
residues found in a sanddab population in southern Mon-
terey Bay, an attempt to determine the approximate rate
of uptake of chlorinated hydrocarbons and their deposi-
tion within the body was made.
Uptake of DDT can be realized in the marine envi-
ronment by two methods: assimilation from ingested food,
or direct absorption from the water environment. Con-
centration of persistent insecticides through food chains
in terrestial, estuarine and marine systems has been in-
vestigated (Woodwell, 1967, Woodwell, et.al., 1967 and
Risebrough, et.al., 1967). Uptake directly from the
water in salmonid fishes has been studied using C-labeled
DDT by Premdas and Anderson (1963) and A.V. Holden (1962)
working with Atlantic salmon and brown trout respectively.
In this investigation, DDT uptake directly from the
water is emphasized. Approximate rates of uptake, depo-
sition in various organs, mobility of the pesticide
within the fish and possible excretion of DDT under con-
ditions of low external concentration of the insecticide
2

were studied. Direct uptake of DDT from sea water at
concentrations approximating those of the bottom sediments
is shown to be a significant route of pesticide accum-
ulation in Citharichthys stigmaeus.
Materials and Methods
Citharichthys stigmaeus in the 4 - 10 cm. length
range (total length from tip of the closed mouth to end
of caudal fin) were caught in a 10 foot otter trawl off
Del Monte beach in southern Monterey Bay, California (fig. 1).
The fish were collected in water from 1.5 to 10 m. just
outside the surf line. Three collections at the same
location during the month of May, 1969, were sufficient
to provide fish for experimentation. Approximately 40
small flatfish were caught with each 10 minute trawl.
Citharichthys stigmaeus comprised about 75% of the flat-
fish caught by this method. The fish used were approx-
imately 9 months to 1.5 years old, as determined by
scale and otolith measurements (Parrish, personal com-
munication; Arora, 1951), and had not attained sexual
maturity.
In the laboratory, fish were kept in Flowing-water,
aerated aquaria at ambient sea water temperatures of
12 - 15°0. They were fed approximately 0.5 g. of frozen
brine shrimp per gram of fish per day.
6
Analyses for ambient levels of DDT residues were
carried out isothermally (200°0.) on a Beckman Gc4
gas-liquid chromatograph. The machine was equipped
with a 3% QFi column on 80-100 mesh 'Chromosorb W' and
an electron capture detector. Helium was the carrier
gas. Tissue samples were prepared for chromatography
by the perchloric - glacial acetic acid rapid digestion
and cleanup technique described By Stanley and LeFavoure
(1965). Nannograde hexane was used for lipid extraction
and glassware cleaning. Tissues and lipid extracts were
weighed on a Mettler Type H15 Cap. 160g analytical balance.
Glassware was checked on the chromatograph for presence
of DDT residues before each extraction. Tissue samples
were pooled from 25 fish to obtain enough lipid extract
for accurate weight determination. During chromato-
graph operation, standard samples were periodically run
to ensure accuracy of peak height determination,
In the uptake experiments, fish were incubated at
14°0. in sealed one gallon jars containing 1 ppb ring
labeled C"DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)
ethane) with a specific activity of 19 mC/mM. Sea water
in the incubation jars was aerated for approximately 10
minutes prior to addition of radioactive DDT and test
animals, after which the jars were sealed to prevent
loss of DDT by codistillation. Fish were weighed and
measured before incubation. Their average weight was
66
1.8 g. and their average length was 5.7 cm. Incubations
were run for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 9, 14, 18, 24 and 36 hours;
four fish were used in each incubation. At the end of
each experiment the four fish were removed from the jars
and killed. The skin, gills, brain, liver, gut (stomach
and intestines) and muscle were then removed and weighed.
Skin samples were patches (approximately 1.5 cm") taken
from the region posterior to the pectoral fin on both the
"dorsal" and"ventral" surfaces. Muscle samples used were
from the area exposed by removal of skin patches. Whole
organ samples were used for brain, liver, gut and gills.
After weighing, tissues were homogenized with a test tube
mortar and motorized teflon pestle in 2 mls. of N.N-di-
methylformamide. An additional 2 mls. of DMF was used to
wash the mortar and pestle. Two washings with 95% ethanol
ensured complete cleaning of dissection tools and homog-
enization equipment between each tissue sample (periodic
checks of these washes showed no significant scintillation
activity above background). The 4 ml. of DMF and tissue
homogenate mixture were poured into a 20 ml. scintillation
vials and 10 mls. of toluene scintillation fluid (4 g. PPO
and 100 mg. POPOP/liter) was added. The samples were
counted in a Nuclear-Chicago Unilux II, two-channel scin-
tillation counter. CDDT concentrations in ppb were
calculated for each tissue from C disintegrations per
minute and wet weights of the tissues. C DDT remaining
in the incubation jar after the experiment was extracted
with petroleum ether and counted with the tissue samples,
For excretion experiments, fish averaging 2.0 g. and
5.4 cm. were incubated in 1 ppb CDDT for 4 hours as in
the uptake experiments. After the 4 hour pulse the fish
were transferred to normal sea water in 3000 ml. incu-
bation flasks for periods of 24, 48, and 72 hours. The
sea water was aerated and gas traps with chloroform and
2M NaoH were set up to prevent CDDT from escaping into
the laboratory. Dissection, homogenization and counting
methods were the same as in the uptake incubations.
Results
Average fish length of the 25 fish pooled for gas
chromatography was 5.3 cm. The results of the analyses
are summarized in Table 1. The ambient levels are given
here in parts per million DDE in both wet weight and
lipid weight. DDT and DDD peaks were also observed in
the samples, but the column was unable to resolve these
peaks into measurable quantities. Risebrough (1968, in
press) found that DDE comprised 70% of the total DDT res-
idues in English sole from Monterey Bay.
Uptake experiment results are given in Table 2. All
fish in incubation jars with 1 ppb C"DDT died between
24 and 36 hours of incubation. Control fish in sealed
jars with normal sea water died between 40 and 45 hours
of incubation. CDDT extracted from the incubation jars
at the end of 24 hours had a concentration of 0.25 ppb.
The 36 hour extract contained 30% of the original 1 ppb.
Data from the 4 hour pulse experiments are listed
in Table 3. All experimental and control fish lived for
the entire 72 hour incubation in normal, aerated sea water.
Sea water extracts had less than 0.01 ppb C1DDT concen-
tration after 72 hours, while the chloroform and NaoH
gas traps contained appreciable labeled DDT (approximately
0.05 ppb in the CHCla and 0.02 ppb in the NaoH after 72
hours). These data suggest that codistillation of any
excreted DDT out of the experimental flasks occurred during
these incubations. The extent of this codistillation
loss can be up to 90% after 48 hours (McCarthy, personal
communication).

Discussion
The concentrations of DDT residues found in a natural
population of Citharichthys stigmaeus support the evidence
(Risebrough, 1968, in press and Odemar, 1968) of the pres-
ence of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides in marine flat-
fish. Separate tissue analyses by gas chromatography
show that ambient pesticide levels are correlated with
the lipid content of the tissues in which they are
found (Table 1). The relatively low concentration of
DDE per weight of lipid in the gills suggests that some
of the pesticide is adsorbed on the gill surface. This
conclusion is substantiated by the finding in CDDT up-
take experiments that approximately 50% of the label was
adsorbed of both skin and gills (determined by tissue
washes in dimethylformamide before homogenization).
The evidence that DDT residues are found within the
sanddab in the natural environment shows that the fish
can concentrate the pesticide within its body. The data
from uptake experiments suggest a method for direct up-
take from the water. Evidence here indicates that direct
water uptake of DDT is as important a method for pesti-
cide build-up in the natural environment as accumulation
through the food chain.
Premdas and Anderson (1963) concluded that ClDDT
uptake in the Atlantic salmon occurs mainly through the
gills and is transported through the body by the blood.
My data suggest that the same model is correct for
Citharichthys stigmaeus. Furthermore, because marine fish
swallow water to maintain osmotic balance (Brown, 1957).
an important route of uptake may be through the gut wall.
Data indicate that a limited amount of uptake is through
the skin also, because 50% of the label in skin is absorbed
C14DDT. Uptake data are presented graphically is Figs. 2
32.
and 3.
Radioactivity in all tissues studied decreased mark-
edly after 24 hours, which corresponds to the death of the
experimental animals. Premdas and Anderson also observed
this decrease in DDT concentrations while working with
uptake of lethal doses, and attributed it to a possible
alteration in permeability attending death. It appears
that uptake and retention of DDT is an active process.
Death of the experimental fish after 24 hours is probably
not due to acute DDT poisoning. Rather, the general phys-
iological stress on the fish because of DDT uptake may
cause its death by suffocation earlier than control fish;
or more specifically, increased respiration due to DDT
uptake may cause a more rapid depletion of the limited
oxygen supply in the experimental container. No evidence
is available, however, for increased respiration or de-
pletion of the oxygen supply.
Until the time of death, DDT concentrations in all
tissues increases steadily. One notable exception is the
gills, in which the uptake rate decreases almost to zero
after 4 hours (Fig. 2). This suggests a point at which
an equilibrium is achieved between uptake by the gills
and transport of the pesticide by the blood away fromtthe
gills to other parts of the body. An interesting obser-
vation related to this assumption is that brain, liver,
and gut uptake rates decrease slightly and remain fairly
27
constant after the initial four hours until death. The
suggestion is that once equilibrium is achieved in the
gills, the other organs receive absorbed DDT from the
gills at a constant rate. It is possible that uptake
through the gills is in equilibrium with the concentration
of pesticide in the sea water environment and that in
these experiments the adjustment to the higher concen-
tration of DDT takes approximately 4 hours. Further ev-
idence of this proposed dynamic equilibrium is see in the
excretion data.
Fig. 4 shows the results of the pulse experiments.
Organs can be paired according to their position in the
circulatory system: gills - brain, liver - gut, and
skin - muscle. Similarities of the plots for these pairs,
both in pulse and uptake experiments, indicates that
blood circulation is the carrier of DDT residues through-
out the body of the fish. Furthermore, these data sug-
gest that DDT is quite mobile within the body,
Fa
The initial drop in concentration in the gills prob-
ablyis due to both loss to the circulatory system and loss
to the environment (Fig. 4). The low lipid content of the
gills increases the exchange efficiency of this organ.
Loss of DDT from the gills seems to be favorable when
equilibrium is disrupted in a less concentrated envir-
onment. The pesticide may be lost due to solubility in
the water, but probably to a sloughing of gill mucus se-
cretions. The DDT concentration in the incubation flasks
was quite low, due to constant aeration of the water and
resultant codistillation. Therefore, the situation in
these incubations is favorable for loss of DDT from the
gills. Fig. 5 shows that the gills lost over 90% of their
initial label after 72 hours. Retention of label after
72 hours does not seem to be related to lipid content of
a tissue, but rather to its venous proximity to the gills.
Carnivorous fish have generally lower pesticide levels
in the natural environment than sea birds on the same
trophic level (Risebrough, 1968, in press). An explanation
may be ability to excrete DDT residues via the gills.
The rise in gill radioactivity at 44 hours corres-
ponds with a similar rise in brain concentrations (Fig.
4).
This suggests a mobility of DDT anteriorly, probably via
the hepatic vein, as the liver and gut lose some C14ppT.
Skin and muscle retain their label with few fluctuations
in concentration.
A comparison of gas chromatography (Table 1) and uptake
experiment data shows a direct correlation between ambient
levels and rates of uptake from water (Table 4). This
correlation suggests that uptake directly from water, if
not the most important method of accumulation of chlorinated
hydrocarbons by Citharichthys stigmaeus, is a significant
mode of entry. Food chain effects may not be as evident
78
12
in juveniles, because they presumably feed on lower trophic
levels than adults.
Jabla!
The liver has the highest concentrations of DDT res-
idues, both naturally and in uptake experiments. This
organ concentrated DDT most effectively in the Atlantic
salmon (Premdas and Anderson, 1963) and the northern an-
chovy (Kaplan, personal communication). This is andim-
portant consideration because fish liver has been shown
to contain mixed-function oxidases (Buhler, 1968) which
hydroxylate a wide variety of compounds, including steroid
sex hormones, and are induced by DDT and its derivatives,
There are several reasons why the liver should be such an
effective concentration site: 1) DDT absorbed by the gills
can be transported directly to the liver by the hepatic
artery; 2) DDT ingested either with swallowed water or
food reaches the liver by the hepatic portal system directly
from the gut; 3) a large degree of vascularization in the
liver provides greater surface area for absorption of pest-
icide and 4) the liver has a high lipid content.
Fig. 6 shows a schematic diagram of a typical fish
circulatory system and presents a hypothetical model for
DDT uptake in Citharichthys stigmaeus.
Feeding experiments are necessary to confirm the role
of DDT in food in the total uptake of these fish. It is
assumed that activity from CDDT ingested with food would
be found mainly in the gut, liver and perhaps feces. Most
of the C1DDT remaining in the blood after leaving the
liver would probably be lost through the gills and little
would reach the brain.
