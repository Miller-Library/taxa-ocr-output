D. Asexual reproduction and regeneration
In order to determine various aspects of regeneration,
P. prolifica were sectioned with a scapel in different areas
of the body: between the anterior and median sections, after
the first foliaceous parapodia, after the third foliaceous
parapodia, and between the median and posterior sections. Both
halves of the sectioned individuals were placed in plastic cap¬
illary tubes and kept in running seawater.
Further information on regeneration was obtained by observing
regenerating individuals ejected from natural tubes.
Results
A general growth and time sequence for anterior regeneration
in P. prolifica was determined (Figure 12). Frame A shows the
healed wound after sectioning an individual with a scalpel.
Healing of the wound is done by invagination, and occurs within
ten hours after sectioning.
Frames B and C show the extension phase of anterior re¬
generation. The new tissue formed is white, and no external
segmentation is visible.
It should be noted that palps and a mouth form before any
external segmentation can be seen (Frame D). Segmentation is an
all at once process, as parapodial lobes develop for all segments,
then setae appear (Frame E).
Frame F shows a fully functional miniaturized anterior re-
gion, which is still very white compared to the normal cream color
of the anterior region. After an individual has reached this
stage, the new anterior region enlarges and regains its normal
color over a 2 to 3 week period.
