Table 1 Time for particle uptake by each of three animals in
six 15 cm. long plastic tubes.
The same six tubes
were used for all three trials.
Time spent in various positions in tubes. Zero position

represents the open end. The 15 cm. position represents
the end covered with phytoplankton netting.

Percent time that individuals protruded or withdrew palps
from ends of tubes.
Lab: n=10, observed 5 hours.
Field: n=15, observed 2 hours.
