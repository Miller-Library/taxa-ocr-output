Phyllochaetopterus
Regenerating individuals exhibited notable behavior. The
anterior halves of those individuals sectioned in the median
region set up partitions and built extensions on their tubes,
a normal behavior for naturally occurring individuals. These
individuals were also observed to have their palps protruding
from the end of their tubes. Anterior halves of individuals
sectioned between the anterior and median regions exhibited no
such behavior, and were often found to have fallen out of their
tubes onto the bottom of the finger bowl in which they were
stored. This phenomenon was also observed in the case of post-
erior halves sectioned between the median and posterior regions,

Unlike Chaetopterus variopedatus, where the ability to
regenerate is body region specific (Berrill, 1928), PhylloÂ¬
chaetopterus prolifica has the ability to regenerate anteriorly
or posteriorly from any section in the body. It is not known
if regeneration can occur both anteriorly and posteriorly from
one segment; however, cases have been observed where regeneration
is proceeding in both directions. As found for C. variopedatus,
no dedifferentiation of existing segments seems to occur during
regeneration.
The total number of segments in the anterior region of an
individual is constant. This number is achieved in regeneration
whether complete or partial regeneration is occurring.
Complete anterior regeneration is a faster process than
posterior regeneration. There seems to be a need for a fully
functional anterior section to regenerate fairly quickly. This
assumption is supported by the development of sensory and feeding
organs (palps, eye spots, and a mouth) before the development of
