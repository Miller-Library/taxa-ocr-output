development occurs. Larvae may be searching for mature sexual
tubes to settle on, and, if unsuccessful, they settle solitarily
and develop into sexual forms themselves.
It is doubtful that the individuals found with gametes in
asexual tubes ever develop into fully mature, sexual individuals.
For maximum genetic input, these 'maturing' asexual individuals
would have to grow to a size paralleling that of the mature sex¬
ual individuals. This also seems unlikely as the average asex-
ual individual would have to increase its length at least tenfold,
This increase in size would require a large tube to accomadate
the individual. However, the total lack of connections between
asexual and sexual tubes and the uniform diameter of large tubes
indicate that no enlargement is taking place. It is also highly
improbable that an individual would leave its tube to start
building a new one, due to the presence of predators associated
with the colony, and an individuals inability to maneuver effi¬
ciently outside of a tube.
A possible explanation for the presence of egg-bearing
individuals in asexual tubes may be the decrease in effect of
the sexual maturation inhibitory process, permitting limited
gamete production. This decrease in effectiveness may be due
to the colony size or certain environmental factors. It is sus¬
pected that the gametes produced are eventually reabsorbed by the
asexual individual.
