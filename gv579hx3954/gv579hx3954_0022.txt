as having up to 40 or more posterior segments, and no description
of different sexes was given. The striking difference of the ex-
ternal morphology between sexual and asexual forms shown previous¬
ly, coupled with the finding of egg-bearing individuals in asexual
tubes, leads us to believe that the sexual forms described by
Berkeley and Berkeley are the egg-bearing individuals in asexual
tubes.
The fact that sexual individuals are always found associated
with sexual individuals, and the discovery of sexual forms in
isolation suggests that the asexual colonies arise from larvae
which settle on sexual individuals. This assumption is supported
by the finding of uniform asexual tube diameters in a colony, while
variations occur between colonies. This variation is most probably
not due to environmental factors, as colonies of varying tube di¬
ameters were found in close proximity of one another. One possi¬
ble explanation for this variation may be genetic similarity within
a colony, and genetic dissimilarity between colonies. The possi¬
bility exists that an asexual colony can arise from a single asex¬
ual individual.
A possible model for asexual versus sexual development is
differential development of settled larvae. Larvae that settle
solitarily develop directly into sexual individuals, while those
that settle in close proximity of mature, sexual individuals
are inhibited from maturing and develop asexually. This is
supported by the finding of single immature individuals in large
tubes, and the constant association of sexual individuals with
asexual individuals. Since sexual individuals are found near
one another, this differential settling may be very specific for
the presence of already mature sexual individuals before asexual
