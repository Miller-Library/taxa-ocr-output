tubes. The retraction of the individuals into the tubes was
measured. The process was repeated 30 seconds after the palps
reappeared at the end of a tube, and time intervals between
stimulations were recorded. The process was repeated 20 times
with 10 individuals. Table 4 shows the average distance
retracted in response to the different weights. The difference
is significant to a level of .001. Thus the response is
graded; stimulation with the heavier weight causes a greater
withdrawal. No habituation to stimulation was found after
20 trials.
Autotomy of the palps was tested by clamping lead
shavings onto the palps of 20 individuals and recording the time
required for releasal. All 20 palps were released at the point
of attachment to the body, either by a jerk or by a long, steady
pull. The average time required for release was 4.5 minutes,
with a range from 15 seconds to 13 minutes.
The force required to release a palp was determined by
clamping successive lead shavings onto it, until it was released,
The force needed to break a palp was similarly found by
holding one end of a palp with forceps and adding shavings to
the other end until it broke. The force required for release
was 3.5 times greater than the force neede to break a palp
(2015 and 70:10 dynes, respectively).
Palps are frequently lost in natural populations; 54 out
of 300 individuals were found with regenerating palps. Regen-
erating palps are translucent and flared until they reach a
length of 1-1.4 mm. At this time the ends become knobbed,
and the palps themselves take on a brownish hue. Palp regen-
