fact that asexual reproduction by autotomy and regeneration is
taking place in the median body region of P. prolifica.
E. Aspects of sexual forms
Investigation of Phyllochaetopterus colonies revealed the
presence of two different tube sizes. The smaller tubes ranged
in diameter from 0.5-1.0 mm, while the larger tubes ranged from
1.2-1.8 mm. Whereas the smaller tubes contained the expected
multiple asexual forms, the large tubes were, singly inhabited
by a much larger fonm of P. prolifica. Table 5 compares average
number of segments per body region in the two forms. The differ¬
ences in all means are significant at the.OOl level.
The posterior segments of the large forms are either orange
or cream colored, associated with the presence of female and male
gametes respectively. The orange color in the female is due pri¬
marily to pigmented spheres; the eggs themselves are brown, often
not quite spherical, and range in size from 65-70 1. Coloration
in the male is due to the sperm, which are slightly oval with a
diameter of 3 /. Attempts to fertilize eggs were made in the
latter part of May, but were unsuccessful.
Twenty colonies of P. prolifica were examined, all containing
at least four sexual forms in individual large tubes. Each large
tube was enmeshed with small tubes, forming a dense, flat mat
which was attached to a styrofoam float or a cement pillar.
Integration of a large tube into the mat occurred either at one
end with the other end of the tube hanging freely, or in the
middle of the tube with both ends hanging freely.
Tubes containing sexual individuals are very rarely branched
(3 tubes out of 123 investigated), and if so, only in the last
few centimeters of the free-hanging end. No connections between
