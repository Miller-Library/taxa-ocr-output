Biology of Phyllochaetopter
The individual furthest from the open end typically did not
begin to catch the algae in its mucus bags until after 30 min¬
utes exposure. Most had caught algae after an hour. Three
of these tubes had three pin holes each, located along the
length of the tube. A t-test showed no significant difference
in rates of Dunaliella pick-up between the group with holes
and the group without (Table 1).
Water flows in the tubes at about 1 mm/sec until it pas¬
ses the foliaceous parapodia, slowing to 0.2 mm/sec past the
posterior region. The cilia covering much of the dorsal surface
set up eddies, resulting in turbulent water flow. The arrows
in Figure 7 show the directions of water flow around the body.
P. prolifica was able to tolerate oxygen stress. Ten
individuals were placed in each of five glass-stoppered reagent
bottles. Nitrogen was bubbled through three of these for 15
minutes, while air was bubbled through the other two. Oxygen
tension in the nitrogen bottles was determined with an oxygen
electrode to be less than 10% saturation. The bottles were
sealed and left in running sea water for 19 hours. After re¬
moval and examination, all animals were alive, and no differ¬
ences could be detected between the individuals in low oxygen
tension and the controls.
The movement of individuals in artificial tubes was
periodically observed during a five hour period. Three indivi¬
duals were placed in each of four 15 cm long plastic tubes,
one end of which was covered with phytoplankton netting. These
were vertically suspended in a running sea water aquarium.
Individuals were distinguished by the different number of fol¬
