eration was studied by removing the palps from healthy
individuals. This was done both by pulling with forceps to
autotomize them and by cutting them with a scalpel to a length
of approximately .75 mm. Growth was measured daily. Similar
rates of regeneration were obtained for the two different
cases; the palps grew about .25 mm per day (Figures 10,11).
The growth was fairly linear, and the only difference between
the two cases was the initial 3-day period during which there
were no visible signs of growth for the palps which were pulled
free.

Observations on individuals occupying the ends of tubes
indicate that the palps are frequently protruded. The rarity
of fecal pellet ejection and the frequency of particle capture
suggest palps are protruded to feed. This feeding activity
is, of course, greatly reduced when an individual is not at
the end of a tube. Nevertheless, this phenomenon can serve
as a valuable, accessory feeding mechanism.
Besides serving to supplement filter-feeding, the palps
are important in clearing the tubes, especially in moving debris
away from the tube openings. Individuals who had their palps
removed tended to keep both ends of their tubes closed with
partitions. Feces aggregated about the ends of these tubes,
and the partitions were not removed until the palps were long
enough to successfully eject debris. This suggests that the
partitions were constructed to prevent the reentry of feces
into the tubes.
The frequency of regenerating palps in natural populaÂ¬
tions leads one to believe that the loss of palps, possibly
