Biology of Phylloch
lined with large, flagellum-like membranelles; their beat
draws water posteriorly through the loops. The dorsal groove
passes under the medial loop and widens posterior to each noto¬
podium, forming a cupule. A small (0.15-0.20 mm), clear ball
made of mucus secreted by the medial loop rotates in the cupule.
The balls catch and tightly pack particles which are driven
past them by the beating membranelles. The medial loop period¬
ically spreads apart, and the balls move forward along the dorsal
groove to the mouth where they are ingested (Barnes, 1965).
The posterior region is dark green and has a highly
variable number of segments, never exceeding forty-five. Each
notopodium is elongate and has a ciliated tip from which protrudes
one seta. The bilobed neuropodial flaps have uncinal plagues
which are used to brace the animal against the tube. This region
is used primarily for locomotion and stability.
The asexual form of P. prolifica inhabits large, dense
clumps of twisted, weakly annulated tubes. These tubes consist
of a parchment-like substance which is deposited in layers
(Barnes, 1965). Older sections of tubes are opaque and thickened,
whereas sections of new growth are thin, translucent, and more
regularly annulated. Areas of new growth can expand to accom¬
modate additional internal layering.
The colonies have a matted base of tightly packed tubes
which is attached to a substrate. The tubes radiate from the
substrate and are frequently and irregularly branched, especially
near the base. A high degree of interconnection exists between
tubes, and it is possible that the entire colony has arisen from
the extensive growth and branching of one or a few tubes. The
