Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
clumps tend to have an even upper boundary with the majority
of tubes opening at this surface.
The tubes range in diameter from .5-1.2 mm, and are
inhabited by as many as twelve individuals in a one-foot section.
Individuals in the tubes often build transverse partitions
between each other. These opaque white partitions contain two
holes made by the modified fourth setiger. It is presumed
that the fourth setiger is also used to make the small pores
which appear irregularly along the sides of the tubes.
B. Irrigation and Feeding
For thirty-seven tubes, there was an average of one
animal in every five centimeters of tube (r=0.84, p(.01,Figure 3).
The number of pores in a tube was counted by constricting
one end with cotton thread, gently forcing water into the other
end with a syringe, and counting the number of leaks. These
were unevenly spaced, but they averaged one to every 3.3 centi¬
meters of tube (r=0.73, p(.01,Figure 4). There was an average
of 1.7 pores per animal (r=0.74, p«.01, Figure 5). All slopes.
had 95% confidence limits which did not include zero as a pos¬
sible slope (Sokal and Rohlf, 1968).
P. prolifica filters particles from the irrigation water
using the mucus ball method described earlier. Animals were
always seen producing mucus balls with all except the first
foliaceous notopodia, unless the animals were doubled over
or passing a tube-mate.
The balls average 0.15-2.0mm in diameter when passed
forward to the mouth. When three animals were placed in con¬
centrations of Nitzschia which ranged from 10'to 10 cells per
