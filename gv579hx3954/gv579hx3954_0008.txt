iaceous notopodia on each. Figure 8 summarizes the observations.
Each individual was closest to the tube opening relative
to the others in its tube for three or four of the ten observaÂ¬
tion times. An analysis of variance showed no statistical
difference in the average times spent in each position. The
average interval between times spent in the closest position
was 1.8 hours, and the average distance travelled was 7.5 cm/hr.

The asexual form of P. prolifica is a highly modified
filter feeder which lives in a complex and densely populated
community. It therefore must have evolved a method for ensuring
that all tube-mates get adequate food and oxygen. Efficient
tube irrigation would seem necessary for success. However, the
long length, small diameter, branches, and closed ends of the
tubes might make irrigation difficult. Instead, P. prolifica
has evolved an energetically economical system which involves
a minimum of pumping and the need for little coordination
among tube-mates.
The slow speed at which water passes the animals' posterior
segments and the slow rate at which individuals further from
the tube opening pick up particles suggest that water moves
only slowly from the opening into the further reaches of the
tube. There the water may be stagnant and depleted of food
particles. However, animals continually change positions in
the tube; each animal therefore spends time at the tube mouth.
Food would travel through the gut of a typical animal in about
1.5 hours, and the average time spent away from the opening of
a tube is 1.8 hours. Thus the animal may move to the opening
