Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
Hovden Cannery. Several of these colonies were wired to sty¬
rofoam and were floated in their natural orientation in running
sea water aquaria. Parts of these colonies were periodically
removed for experimentation; otherwise they remained undisturbed,
Other colonies were dissected immediately after collection.
Removal of individuals from natural tubes and their
placement into plastic or glass tubes were carried out as described
by Barnes (1965). The artificial tubes were kept in petri dishes
or finger bowls in running sea water, and were observed with
dissecting and compound microscopes. Plastic tubes were Intra¬
medic Polyethylene Tubing with internal diameters of .045 inches
and variable lengths. Glass tubes were 0.9-1.1 mm in diameter
and 100 mm in length.
Observations of currents and feeding were made using
carmine particles, the diatom Nitzschia longissima, and the
green alga punalieila tertiolecta to trace water movement. These
were suspended in sea water filtered through a Millipore filter,
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. General Description
The body of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica is divided into
three distinct regions (Figure 1). The anterior region is cream¬
colored or light tan and contains ten to twelve setigerous
segments. The rounded prostomium, which has two lateral eye¬
spots, is surrounded by the peristomial collar and lips. Paired
palps and antennae arise at the base of the prostomium.
The palps are approximately equal to the anterior region
of the body in length. Their coloration varies from tan to
