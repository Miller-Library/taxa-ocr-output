Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
Varying abilities for anterior regeneration were observed
as a function of the location of the artificial sectioning. Those
individuals sectioned between the anterior and median region,
after the first foliaceous parapodia, and after the third folia-
ceous parapodia regenerated at approximately equal rates. In
contrast, those individuals sectioned between the median and the
posterior sections were observed to take comparatively longer
times for similar development.
Feeding was observed as early as stage A, but it was not
as efficient a process as observed for normal individuals. At
stage F feeding was observed to be essentially normal. Feeding
was not observed for regenerating individuals lacking foliaceous
parapodia.
Posterior regeneration
A general time and growth sequence for posterior regeneration
was also determined (Figure 13). Frame A shows the healed
wound after sectioning. In this case, healing is accomplished
by evagination of the gut lining.
As can be seen in frame C, neuropodia develop before noto¬
podia in the extended region. However, unlike anterior regenera¬
tion, segmentation occurs in a sequential pattern through time.
The oldest segments are the most anterior and decrease in age
posteriorly.
Ppsterior regeneration occurs over an indefinite amount of
time. After the initial growth of the tail, the process slows,
and segments are then added a few at a time, with no observible
pattern. This is evidenced by the finding of individuals in
tubes with 20 or more normal sized posterior segments and a very
small extension with one or two developing neuropodia.
