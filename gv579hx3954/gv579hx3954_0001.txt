Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
INTRODUCTION
Phyllochaetopterus prolifica (Chaetopteridae) is a
sedentary polychaete occurring in dense colonies of highly
branched tubes (Potts, 1914). Like other Chaetopteridae,
its body is divided into three distinct and highly differ¬
entiated regions (Figure 1).
The external morphology of the species was investi¬
gated and described by Potts (1914), and also by Berkeley
and Berkeley (1952).
Work done on closely related species includes that
done by Barnes (1964, 1965), who investigated tube building
and feeding in Chaetopteridae. Extensive regeneration stud¬
ies on Chaetopterus variopedatus were carried out by Berrill
(1928) and Faulkner (1932). The possibility of regeneration
as a means of asexual reproduction for Phyllochaetopterus
was discussed by Potts (1914), who suggested autotomy as a
cause for the multiple occupancy of their tubes. However,
Potts did not document his statements.
This paper investigates various aspects of the biology
of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica: its methods of tube irriga¬
tion and feeding, the functional morphology of the palps, its
methods of asexual reproduction and regeneration, and aspects
of its sexual forms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Colonies of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica were collected
during April and May from three areas: the floats at the Monterey
marina, the pilings at Monterey Wharf #2, and the kelp beds off
