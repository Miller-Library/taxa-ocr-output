of tube-building. Those without palps had much slower rates
(Figure 9). The individuals without palps made only small
additions to the tubes and kept both ends closed with partitions.
These worms cleared their tubes by pushing feces out through
holes in the partitions with their peristomial collars. The
feces aggregated about the ends of the tubes. After about seven
days, the partitions were removed and the rate of tube-building
increased. The palps were 1-1.4 mm in length, long enough
to be extended out in front of the body.
A study was undertaken to determine the percentage of
time that individuals occupying the ends of tubes spend with
their palps protruding. Ten individuals in natural tubes were
placed in a glass bowl filled with sea water and watched
continuously for five hours. Similarly, fifteen individuals
were observed for two hours in their natural habitat at the
Monterey marina. Although the values obtained varied consid¬
erably from individual to individual, the palps were protruded
50% of the time (Table 3). During the seven hours of obser¬
vation, the palps were frequently seen carrying small particles
to the mouth; only five instances of ejection of debris from
the tubes were recorded.
In order to test the responsiveness of the palps to
mechanical stimulation, an artificial colony of individuals
in natural tubes was set up in a large glass bowl of sea water.
One end of each tube was held in place by clay, and the other
end was left free. In separate trials, l gm and .l gm weights
(only the difference in magnitudes is important) were dropped
from a height of 1 inch onto palps protruding from the ends of
