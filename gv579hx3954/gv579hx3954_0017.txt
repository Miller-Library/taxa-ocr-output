Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
As in anterior regeneration, varying abilities for posterior
regeneration were observed. Individuals sectioned between
the median and posterior regions, after the third foliaceous para-
podia, and after the first foliaceous parapodia regenerated
at approximately equal rates. Those individuals sectioned between
the median and anterior regions were observed to take compara¬
tively longer time for similar development.
Foliaceous parapodia regeneration
Foliaceous parapodia have been observed to regenerate be¬
tween the anterior and median sections of individuals. Regen-
eration between median and posterior segments has never been
observed, but the possibility should not be excluded. Time in¬
volved in this process seems to be rather long, and no inherent
pattern or criteria for regeneration has been determined.
Regeneration in natural tubes
Up to 30% of the individuals inhabiting natural tubes have
been found undergoing some stage of regeneration. 82% (49 of 60)
of the recently budded individuals (frame B in figs. 12813) have
foliaceous parapodia directly either anterior or posterior to the
budded area; the other 18% are budded directly anterior to a
variable number of setigerous segments in the anterior region of
the individual. In this case, as with regeneration of whole an-
terior sections, the number of setigerous segments in the fully
regenerated individual is pre-determined, and enough segments
are added to complete the normal anterior region. No indivi¬
duals have been found to be regenerating from anterior or post-
erior segments alone.
