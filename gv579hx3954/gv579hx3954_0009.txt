when it needs to empty its gut and move away when its gut
is full.
MacGinitie (1945) found that Chaetopterus yariopedatus
can filter particles as small as proteins with its mucus net.
P. prolifica may have the same ability, and it can filter out
54 Dunaliella cells and also catch macroscopic particles with
its palps.
This ability to exploit a large range of particle
sizes, coupled with the ability to change the speed of mucus
ball formation with particle concentration, would allow the
animal to feed quickly. However, the sigmoid nature of the
curve in Figure 5 suggests that at high concentrations, P.
prolifica is limited by the rate at which it can produce and
consume mucus. At low concentrations the animals probably
have a maximum residence time for mucus balls.
The sections of tube near the opening are probably
deficient in oxygen, since a variety of tubiculous polychaetes
have been shown to remove 50-60% of the oxygen in the water
which passes their bodies (Dales, 1963). P. prolifica can
tolerate low oxygen tensions. The animals lie extended in tubes
with a maximum surface area exposed. The stirring action of
the cilia may serve to increase oxygen uptake by maximizing
exposure to the surrounding water. Furthermore, the pores in
natural tubes might aid in diffusion of water and food particles
into the upper reaches of the tubes, although such an effect
was not seen in the thicker-walled plastic tubes.
Thus all tube-mates are able to endure sub-optimal
conditions in between periods of heavy feeding.
