large tubes or between large and small tubes were observed.
Large tubes are of a uniform diameter throughout their
individual length, and have an average length of 16.2 cm (n=43,
range= 8-23 cm).
Upon investigation of a 10 ft“ area under the floats at the
Monterey marina, sexual forms were found, each occupying their
own tube, in the absence of asexual colonies. Of the 69 in¬
dividuals found in this area, 33 were male, 34 were female, and
two contained no gametes. Although containing no gametes, the
latter two closely resembled the sexual forms in size and appear-
ance.
Individuals that contain orange pigment and eggs have been
found living in association with, and in the tubes of asexual
forms of P. prolifica. However, these individuals resemble the
asexual forms in size and appearance, and the relative amount of
pigment and gametes present is greatly reduced.
Differences were found in the average size of asexual in¬
dividuals found in different colonies. In one colony, tube
diameter was approximately 0.5 mm and the average length of asex¬
ual individuals was 7 mm (n=20, range- 5-9 mm). In another colony,
tube diameter was approximately 1.0 mm, and the average length
of an asexual individual was 14 mm (n=65, range- 10-25 mm). No
differences were noted between the sexual individuals of these
two colonies.

Berkeley and Berkeley (1952) first reported the presence of
sexual forms of P. prolifica. However, they were only described
