Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
UMMARY
1. P. prolifica communally inhabits tubes in densities of
one animal per 4 centimeters of tube.
2. Rate of mucous ball formation is a function of particle
concentration.
3. P. prolifica does not create a unidirectional water flow
through the tubes; instead, each animal periodically comes to the
mouth of the tube to feed.
4. Rate of particle movement through the gut corresponds
to the amount of time spent away from the tube mouth.
5. The palps are used in feeding, voiding feces, and as
sensory appendages.
6. Palps are extended from the tube opening for approximately
50% of the time, in both field and lab observations.
7. Palps are capable of autotomy, and 18% of the population
is found to be in the process of regeneration.
8. P. prolifica has the ability to regenerate anteriorly or
posteriorly from any body region.
9. Anterior regeneration occurs faster than posterior regen¬
eration and is achieved by a different process. Anteriorly, seg¬
mentation and further development of the segments takes place
over the whole new body region uniformly, as cpposed to the more
sequential segment-by-segment process of posterior regeneration.
10. Asexual reproduction by autotomy and regeneration occurs
in the median body region.
11. Sexual forms of P. prolifica are larger and inhabit
bigger tubes than the asexual forms.
