segmentation. Also, a fully functional anterior region is formed
in miniature, and then the enlargement occurs.
This method of
regeneration is completely different from the sequential poster¬
ior method of regeneration, which, as shown, occurs over an in¬
definite amount of time.
In support of asexual reproduction by autotomy in the median
regiom, the following points should be noted:
1) Anterior and posterior regeneration from median regions
is faster than the same processes from posterior or anterior seg¬
ments alone.
2) 82% of the recently budded individuals found in natural
tubes have done so in the median region. The other 18% can be
explained by the loss of anterior segments due to predation. It
is unlikely for autotomy to occur in the anterior region, as
behavior patterns have been shown to be particularly maladaptive
in the case of lone anterior segments.
3) No anterior or posterior regions alone have been observed
undergoing regeneration in natural tubes.
4) Barnes (1965) observed that the foliaceous parapodia
are the major food gathering segments, and provide water currents
through the tubes. It has been observed that regeneration of the
foliaceous parapodia is a slow process. Thus, if autotomy were
to occur outside of the median body region, one half of the split
individual would have to go without these essential segments for
an extended period of time. This process would be maladaptive
for the survival of the half without foliaceous parapodia, and
therefore the advantage of asexual reproduction by autotomy
would be lost.
The preceeding four points clearly support and document the
