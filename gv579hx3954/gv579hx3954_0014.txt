by predation, may be a common phenomenon. The palp's sensitiv¬
ity to mechanical stimulation and the associated withdrawal
response are certainly of adaptive significance to this
animal. The gradation in this response permits the animal to
react appropriately to its environmental cues. Moderate
stimulation, as from particulate matter in the water, causes
a slight retraction, whereas the response to a strong stimulus,
such as would be inflicted by a predator, is a much greater
withdrawal.
The relatively weak attachment of the palp to the body
as compared to the strength of the palp itself could serve to
facilitate the release of an entrapped palp in order to avoid
predation. Shedding a palp seems to have no detrimental conse¬
quences for the individual; a new, functional palp can be
regnerated in ten days or less, and lost functions of the palps
can be compensated for in the meantime.
One final point concerning the palps has to do with the
ability of the animal to distinguish between fecal pellets and
food balls. It is possible that these two types of particles
are selectively separated by either of two independent methods.
One such method involves particle size; the fecal pellets are
too large to be ingested so they remain in the vicinity of the
mouth until they are eventually drawn away by the palps. A
second possibility is that the mucus in the food balls connects
them to the peristomial collar where they are held until
swallowed. Having no such mucus, the fecal pellets are caught
by the palps and carried away when the animal retracts.
