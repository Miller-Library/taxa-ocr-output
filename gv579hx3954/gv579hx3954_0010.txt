C. Function of Palps
P. prolifica uses its palps to remove fecal pellets
and other debris from the tubes. Fecal pellets are passed up
the dorsal, ciliated groove and carried by ciliary action to
the base of the palps. They are subsequently passed out to the
ends of the palps where they are prevented from moving further
by the knoblike processes located there. When the palps are
extended outside of the tubes, they pull apart from each other
and the particles are released.
Two types of particles are regularly carried up the
dorsal, ciliated groove: fecal pellets and food balls. However,
only fecal pellets are ejected by the palps. In order to
determine how this selectivity in rejection of particles is
accomplished, particles in the vicinity of the mouth were
observed for extended periods of time. Only particles less than
2504 in diameter were ever ingested. The diameter of fecal
pellets was found to be 250-350 and that of the mucus balls
was 150-2504. It was also observed that the arrival of particles
at the mouth was usually followed by a short retraction of
the body. During this retraction, fecal pellets were caught
in the outgoing groove of the palps, whereas the mucus balls
remained positioned at the mouth until swallowed.
An experiment was performed to study the effects of palp
removal on both the clearing and building of tubes. 25 individ¬
uals were confined to 10 mm sections of natural tubing. The
palps were removed from 10 of these individuals; the first
parapodia were removed from five others as controls. Tube¬
building was recorded daily, and other observations were made.
The individuals with palps and the controls had similar rates
