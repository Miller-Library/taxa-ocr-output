Biology of Phyllochaetopterus
reddish-brown. They are attached dorsally, anterior to the
antennae. Directly anterior to the point of attachment, the
dorsal and ventral surfaces are rotated 30-45° relative to the
rest of the body; the ventral surfaces are thus tilted toward
the midline of the body. The dorsal surfaces are rounded and
crenulated; the ventral surfaces have two grooves which run
the length of the palps: a shallow, ciliated furrow which car¬
ries particles outward, and a deep, ciliated trough which travel
particles toward the mouth (Figure 2). The end of each palp
is slightly knobbed. They can be held in three different posi¬
tions: extended in front of the body, tucked back along the
dorsal surface, or tightly coiled adjacent to the peristomial
collar.
A ciliated, dorsal groove originates at the base of the
palps and runs the length of the body. Food and fecal pellets
move along it to the mouth and palps from more posterior regions.
The neuropodia of the anterior region have simple setae
and are used for locomotion. The fourth setigerous segment
contains a large,dentate spine used for cutting. Whereas most
of the dorsal surface of this region is covered with cilia,
the ventral surface is unciliated and secretes the tube material
(Barnes, 1965).
The median region is greenish-gray and includes three
to seventeen segments. The neuropodia are short ridges with
uncini which are used to brace the individual against the tube
wall. The noto- and neuropodia are covered with cilia, as is
much of the dorsal surface of the median region. Between the
lobes of the trilobed, foliaceous notopodia there is a loop
