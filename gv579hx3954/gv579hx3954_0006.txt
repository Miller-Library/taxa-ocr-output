Biology of Phyllochaetopte
ml, the time taken for ball formation was significantly less
at higher concentrations (p(.001, Figure 6).
Many of the particles which passed through a foliaceous
parapodium were not caught in the ball immediately behind it.
Water which passed by seven or eight balls still carried par¬
ticles. Some of these were caught in the dorsal groove in the
posterior region and passed forward.
Carmine particles moved through the transparent foregut
at about 2 mm/min. Thereafter, they moved through the dark
hindgut at an average rate of 0.43 mm/min.
Hartman (1969) reports that P.prolifica ranges in length
from 1-6 cm. A typical animal has a hindgut of about 2 cm;
therefore, food would travel through it in about 1.5 hours.
Barnes (1964, 1965) noted that P. socialis and related
species create currents primarily with the beating membranelles
of the foliaceous parapodia. P. prolifica also depends prim¬
arily on this method. In addition, some animals occasionally
show slow posterior to anterior peristaltic waves which set up
currents. The movements of animals through tubes also serve
to circulate water.
P. prolifica does not show an ability to pump a unidi¬
rectional flow of water through a tube. Carmine particles were
observed flowing simultaneously into both ends of a section of
natural tube. Most characteristic was an ebb and flow pattern
at the mouth of the tube.
Six 15 cm long plastic tubes containing three individuals
each were covered at one end with phytoplankton netting. These
were placed in a 10 cells/ mi solution of Dunaliella tertig
