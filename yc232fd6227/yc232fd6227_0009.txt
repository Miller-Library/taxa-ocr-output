gills at levels above those found in bone, so that the
gill filaments themselves may be said to accumulate these
metals. Ting's data also shows this trend. Manganese
is possibly accumulating in the gills, but the values are
too close to those of bone to make a definite statement.
These observations are similar to those made in studies
by Pringle, et. al. (1968) and Brooks, et. al. (1965),
which indicate that the gills of bivalves, due to their
mucous secretions, tend to be sites of concentration of
Cutt, Zn, and Mnt. One theory for the toxicity of
the trace metals upon fish attributes them with causing
asphyxiation. When in high enough concentrations, the
metals have been found to precipitate in the mucous
layers of the gills, blocking respiratory transfers
(Pringle, et. al.).
The liver seems to be accumulating cadmium, zinc,
and copper. The copper levels are especially interesting,
since they range from two to twenty times the levels of
copper in the other tissues. Among the catalytic trace
elements, Bowen includes copper, manganese, and zinc. Thus,
considering the many enzymatic functions of the liver,
the relatively high levels of zinc and copper would be
expected.
Bone concentrates the largest number of the elements
studied, including silver, zinc, manganese, chromium, and
