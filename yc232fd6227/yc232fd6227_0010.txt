cadmium. Chromium and silver especially are found in bone
as opposed to the other tissues. Since much of bone is
inorganic material, concentration of these generally non-
enzymatic elements is not unusual. However, no definite
explanation can be found for the high manganese and zinc
levels. These, too, could be accumulating in the inorganic
fractions of the bone, or they could be involved in some
physiological functions of bone cells. No information
could be found in the literature which could distinguish
between these or other hypotheses.
No general conclusions can be made concerning the
behavior of trace metals as a class in regard to food chain
magnification. As a whole, no single pattern emerged,
with most of the elements in each tissue showing much
scatter between different trophic levels. Hovever, a few
patterns for specific elements in specific tissues are
seen in Figure9- Figure 12. Manganese in the liver,
and zinc in the flesh and bone all show decreasing concen-
trations with increasing trophic levels. This is the same
pattern ovserved in an experiment by Baptist and Lewis (1969)
for both 2n65 and Cr5l in an artificial food chain of
four levels. Although at first this inverse relationship
might appear to be due to decreasing surface/volume ratios
with increasing size, this does not explain the scattered
behavior of most of the other elements with regard to
trophic level.
