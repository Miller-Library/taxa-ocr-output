than those found in open ocean, and give a clearer picture
of what metals are involved as pollutants.
The question of trace metal accumulation was approached
from two points of view. First, for each fish studied,
levels of the seven metals were measured in the flesh,
liver, bone, and gills to determine the principle sites
of concentration of each metal. Flesh was chosen because
of its use in several of the species studied as food by
man. The liver, because of its use as a filtering organ,
and because of its many physiological roles, might be
expected to act as an accumulation site. Bone was chosen
since due to its mineral composition, it might offer a
matrix suitable for the concentration of an entirely dif-
ferent group of metals than those found in the other
tissues. Finally, gills, because of their large surface
area and use as an exchange organ, would be predicted to
be another site of concentration.
The second focus of attention involved trace metal
behavior in food chains. Although the fishes used in this
study do not lie necessarily in the same food chain, they
do fall into general trophic levels. The fish studied
were the top smelt, Atherinops affinis; shiner perch,
Cymatogaster aggregata; starry flounder, Platichthys
stellatus; striped bass, Roccus saxatilis; and the leopard
shark, Triakis semifasciata.
