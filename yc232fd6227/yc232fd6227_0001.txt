LEVLES AND SITES OF CONCENTRATION OF TRACE METALS
IN INSHORE FISHES OF MONTEREY BAY
ABSTRACT
The sites of concentration of the trace metals
cadmium, lead, silver, copper, chromium, manganese, and
zinc were determined for five species of inshore marine
fishes. Generally, zinc and lead accumulate in the gills;
copper, cadmium, and zinc accumulate in liver; and silver,
zinc, manganese, chromium, and cadmium concentrate in bone.
Flesh dosen't noticeably concentrate any of these elements.
Concentration levels with regard to trophic levels were
also examined, and it was found that manganese in the
liver, and zinc in flesh and bone decrease in concentration
with increasing trophic level. Cadmium in the liver may
show a direct relationship of concentration with higher
trophic levels.
