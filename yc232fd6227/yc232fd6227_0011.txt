A rather interesting behavior is observed for cadmium
in the liver, shown in Figure 12. Of the twenty-eight
metal-organ systems studied with regard to food chains,
only cadmium showed any kind of direct relationship
between trophic level and concentration. Although the
uncertainty of Figure 12 is rather large, due to the high
toxicity of cadmium in enzymatic reactions, and the essential
physiological role of the liver, this trend of cadmium to
accumulate at higher trophic levels deserves further study.
Although some conclusions have been reached concerning
the two questions set forth in this study, no definite
statement can be made concerning the more important and
general question: Is trace metal pollution occuring in
these marine fishes? To draw such a conclusion, base-
lines of natural concentrations must exist for comparison.
Ting's study on tuna was used to partially fill this need,
and indeed, as mentioned earlier, there is the possibility
that manganese is acting as a pollutant. Perhaps cadmium
and silver, since they have no known physiological
functions are also occuring due to pollution. But no
such conclusions can be made for the other four metals,
and it is quite possible that all of the levels measured
are simply natural levels. Hopefully, the data obtained
in this study will be of use to other investigators as
comparison values, so that some idea of natural levels
