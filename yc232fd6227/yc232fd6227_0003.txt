INTRODUCTION
Most public attention and much of the research
involving pollution has centered around the introduction
of pesticides, especially DDT and its derivatives, into
the environment. Only recently, with the government's
release of mercury levels in swordfish, has public awareness
focussed on another source of pollution, that of the trace
metals.
Using calculations of the total amount of an element
mined each year as compared to the amount of that element
added to the oceans each year, Bowen (1966) has classified the
pollution potential of many of the trace metals. Silver (Ag),
cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and
zinc (Zn) are all classified as having a very high potential
of pollution. Manganese (Mn) is classified as having a
high potential of pollution.
The detrimental effects of many of the trace metals
have been known for years. Silver is highly poisonous,
and copper, which is used in large amounts in some areas
as a fungicide, is also toxic. The toxicity of manganese
is reported to be moderately high. Chromium, although it
may be important in activating some enzymes, is suspected
of being carcenogenic. Stock's study (1960) of zinc pol-
luton in industrial smoke indicates that this metal may
