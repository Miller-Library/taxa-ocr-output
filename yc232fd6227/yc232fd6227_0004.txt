Cadmium, which is used extensively by man in such
varied items as automobile parts, laundry equipment, and
dental fillings, has been responsible for many human deaths.
In Japan alone, since 1962, fifty-six deaths have resulted
from "Ouchi-Ouchi" disease, which is linked to cadmium-
polluted rice in areas adjacent to mining operations. On
a molecular level, cadmium binds to essential SH-groups
to block the functioning of many enzyme systems (Nillson, 1970).
Lead has long been known to be highly toxic, and yet
in 1965 alone, about 6,000 tons of lead were introduced
into the air of Los Angeles as a result of the use of
tetraethyl lead in gasoline (Lead in the Environment and
its Effects on Humans, 1967). Lead readily co-ordinates
with organic ligands, and is generally toxic to enzyme
systems (Brooks and Rumsby, 1965). Both lead and cadmium
are cumulative poisons, so that exposure to low levels
over an extended period can allow undesirable levels to
accumulate (Bowen).
In an effort to determine the extent to which these
metals are accumulating in marine fishes, a study was made
of the concentration of Ag, Cd. Cr. Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn
in inshore fishes of Monterey Bay. It was felt that the
inshore water mass, due to its proximity to pollution sources,
would tend to accumulate metal pollutants at higher levels
