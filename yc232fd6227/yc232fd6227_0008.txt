species are given in Tables 2A-20. Values determined by
Ting (1967) for albacore and skipjack tunas are found
in Table 3. Ting's values are given as a comparison, since
his fish were pelagic and from a different region (Peru).
His values generally compare closely with the values found
by this study of inshore fishes, with the exception of
manganese. The inshore fishes were often one order of
magnitude higher for manganese than the tunas. This could
possibly be due to manganese accumulation in the inshore
waters, since manganese levels would be expected to be
approximately equal if they were only involved with natural
systems. Veith's study of trace metal introduction into
Monterey Bay (1971) shows that manganese is one of the
principle trace metals found in the sewage effluent. In
addition, he found manganese to be the highest of the metals
studied in sediments near the Monterey sewage outfall.
Manganese concentrations in the two water bodies would
have to be determined before any definite hypotheses could
be made.
The concentrations of each metal by tissue are plotted
in Figure 2 - Figure 8. From these, it can be seen that
certain tissues are accumulating much more of particular
metals than others. Flesh is the site of lowest concentration
for all of the metals. Lead and zinc concentrate in the
