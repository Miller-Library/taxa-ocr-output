size of the gills in some of these fishes, the whole gill
basket, including bone, had to be used. Thus, gills can
be said to accumulate a metal only when that metal's con-
centration in the gills is greater than its concentration
in the bone of the same fish.
Samples were prepared for analysis using a modification
of the wet digestion procedure of Middleton and Stuckey
as described in Christion and Feldman (1970). Samples
were dried at 90'C and powdered with mortar and pestle.
one gram aliquot was dissolved in 5 ml of 90% HNO3 and
refluxed at low temperature. HCl was used to dissolve
any remaining calcareous particles. Two ml of 30% Ho09
were added and the sample was refluxed again before
bringing to volume with distilled water.
All samples were analyzed on a Perkin-Elmer Model 303
atomic absorption spectrophotometer using an air-acetylene
flame. Standard conditions were followed for each element.
For each set of tissues, the mean value was calculated,
and all variation was reported in terms of one standard
deviation. Those tissues for which N = 1 or N = 2 represent
a composit value of five samples which were too small
to be run individually.
