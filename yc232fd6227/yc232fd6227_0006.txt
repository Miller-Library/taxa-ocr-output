trophic level of each fish.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The geographic location of this study is shown in
Figure 1. Elkhorn Slough enters into the central portion
of Monterey Bay. Although there is a small amount of fresh
water entering the slough, generally the physical character-
istics are those of an inshore marine environment (Rote, 1968).
The Pajaro River enters into Monterey Bay about three miles
north of Elkhorn Slough, and is a typical estuarine environ-
ment, with salt water intrusion occuring up to two miles
above the mouth of the river.
The shiner perch (12-14 cm; all were females with young)
and the leopard sharks (100 cm) were captured using gill
nets at Kirby Park in Elkhorn Slough, shown as station 1
in Figure 1. The starry flounder (22-26 cm) were captured
with a beach seinein the yacht harbor of the slough, shown
as station 2. Finally, the top smelt (22-25 cm; all were
females with young) and striped bass (24 cm) were taken
using gill nets, about one mile up from the mouth of the
Pajaro river at station 3.
Tissues were either dissected on the day of capture,
or the whole fish was frozen in a plastic bucket for later
dissection. It should be noted that due to the small
