Heat-Shock Proteins in T. californicus
cells from adverse environmental effects, the mechanism of their
action remains unclear
Given the demonstrated ability of T. californicus to tolerate a
wide range of adverse environment conditions, it seems appropriate
to examine the role the heat-shock response plays in situ. Variation
in the heat-shock response was examined at the level of protein
synthesis for several unique populations of T. californicus, collected
from high tide pools along Mussel Point, Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove, California to provide further insight into the ecological
and physiological significance of the stress protein response.
Materials and Methods
Collection of Tigriopus californicus. Animals were collected with a
small strainer consisting of 100um nylon mesh and PVC pipe from
high tide pools along the west side of Mussel Point at Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove, California. Animal samplings from each pool
were placed in 17 X 100mm polypropylene test tubes, capped, and
dropped into a Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen for flash
freezing. Rock pool temperatures were measured with a Yellow
Springs TeleThermometer. Salinity measurements in parts per
thousand (%/00) were performed with a American Optics portable
refractometer. Water samples from each pool were collected in 35 X
45 mm containers with lids and pH was measured with a Beckman
940 pH meter within 30 minutes.
Collection and maintenance of control animals. Animals were
collected with a small strainer (see description, supra.), placed in a
large beaker containing sea water and carried back to the laboratory
Animals were maintained in Instant Ocean artificial seawater
(Aquarium Systems, Mentor, ÖH) at 32%/00 or 60%00 and kept in a
laboratory incubator with a 12hr light: 12hr dark cycle at
approximately 23°C. Animals were fed ground Tetramin (Tetra Sales,
Morris Plains, NJ) three times per week and were acclimated for at
least 48hr prior to experiments.
