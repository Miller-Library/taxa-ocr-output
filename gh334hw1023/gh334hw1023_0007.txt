Heat-Shock Proteins in T. californicus â€¢ 8
populations. Lanes 4 (43.2%0), 5 (51.9%0), and 7 (78.7%00),
representing animal samples obtained from unique splash pools,
have approximately equal levels of HSP60 protein(s) at 58kD. Lane
3, corresponding to a sampling from a 33%00 rock pool, appears to be
somewhat anomalous, perhaps due to underloading.
Discussion
The levels of HSP60 production under increased salinities in in
situ populations of Tigriopus californicus were found to be different
than those determined by acute salinity shock experiments
performed in the laboratory by Ha (1993) and McEvoy (1993). Ha
found that when T. californicus was acclimated at 16.5%0 artificial
seawater for 24hrs and then immediately transferred to 66%0
seawater, dramatic induction of HSP60 and HSP7O occurred. Ha
further noted that the level of heat-shock proteins in individuals
declined to "pre-shock" levels after approximately four hours at
66%o. In concordance, Hakimzadeh and Bradley (1990) found a
gradual return to normal (non heat-shock) proteins after severe heat
shock in the copepod Eurytemora affinis. Since the heat-shock
response appears to be transient, differences in findings may be
related to acclimation time. In the wild, animals are rarely, if ever
subjected such rapid hyperosmotic shock, as evaporative processes
occur over a much greater time scale.
Since approximately equal
amounts of HSP6O at 58kD were found among the different
populations at varying salinities (Pool Z, 43%0; Pool D, 51%00; Pool Y,
72%/0), it may be that T. californicus copes with a hypersaline
environment without maintaining higher basal levels of HSPs. An
extension of this finding is the prediction that species which live and
function in more stringent habitats (such as hypersaline
environments) have higher thresholds for HSP induction.
Though studies have shown that the kinetics of
thermotolerance induction and decay closely coincide with the
kinetics of heat-shock protein synthesis and degradation (Lindquist,
1986), there is some evidence that tolerance is independent of HSP
