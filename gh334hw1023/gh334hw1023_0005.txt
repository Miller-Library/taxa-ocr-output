Heat-Shock Proteins in T. californicus • 6
buffer (49.6 mM tris, 384mM glycine, 20% methanol, 0.01% SDS )
Immobilon was soaked approximately 5 minutes in methanol. Gel
and Immobilon were mounted in a Hoeffer TE22 transfer apparatus
between the two pieces of Whatman filter paper. Transfer was
carried out at 25mA constant current for 12 hours at 4°C.
Immunostaining. Äfter transfer, Immobilon membranes were
removed from the gel and blocked with TBS/Milk/Tween (60ml 5X
TBS, 15g Carnation nonfat dry milk, 0.3ml Tween20) for 1 hour at
37°C. Blots were subsequently washed with TBS/Tween (IX TBS, 0.5%
Tween) for 15 minutes. Probing occurred with Rabbit Anti-HSP60
polyclonal antibody, developed against Synechococcus sp.
(cyanobacteria) (StressGen, Victoria, B.C., Canada) in 1:1000 dilution
in TBS/Milk/Tween at room temperature for 1 hour with rapid
rocking. Following primary antibody incubation, blots were rinsed
for 10 min in IX TBS, 10 min in TBS/Tween and 10 min in IX TBS
Secondary antibody probing occurred with anti-rabbit IgG (whole
molecule) peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) diluted 1:1000
in IX TBS for 1 hour with rapid rocking. Äfter rinsing, blots were
incubated in Renaissance wester blot chemiluminescence reagents
(DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) for 1 minute and imaged on Kodak X¬
OMAT AR film.
Densitometric analysis. Wet gels and X-ray photographs of
immunoblots were scanned by transmittance with a green filter
using a Pharmacia ImageMaster DTS and analyzed with Pharmacia
ImageMaster Software (Version 1.0) according to prescribed
methods.
Results
In the field at Mussel Point, salinity in the high tide pools
inhabited by Tigriopus californicus varied from 15 to 88%00 during
the period of experiments. The most saline rock pool (88%0) in
which T. californicus was found completely evaporated after
