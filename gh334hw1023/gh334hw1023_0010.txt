Heat-Shock Proteins in T. californicusÂ° 11
Conclusion
The degree of conservation of HSPs and the heat-shock
response across species implies strong natural selection. Since
natural selection can only act on the stress response when it is
evoked, stress which induces HSPs must be somewhat common
among individual organisms. We have sampled Tigriopus
californicus from rock pools of various salinities and measured the
expression of HSP60 in animals. No correlation was found between
HSP60 expression in animals and pool salinity, apparently because of
the ability to osmoregulate. However, differential production of
HSP60 was noted among distinct T. californicus populations.
Whether these differences are genetic or phenotypic remains to be
elucidated.
