Heat-Shock Proteins in T. californicus â€¢ 2
Abstract
The supralittoral harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus is
subject to a wide variety of external stressors. Animals were
collected from splash pools at Mussel Point, Hopkins Marine Station,
Pacific Grove, CA during May 1994 and flash frozen at poolside to
examine the expression of HSP60 heat-shock proteins. No correlation
was found between HSP60 expression in animals and splash pool
salinity, suggesting acclimation through osmoregulation. Differential
expression of HSP60 between T. californicus populations, however,
was noted.
Introduction
The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus, an inhabitant
of splash pools at or above the high-tide mark, is subject to wide
and largely unpredictable variations in temperature, pH, salinity and
water loss. As the high splash pool environment is influenced by
erratic meteorological and tidal disturbances, T. californicus must
exhibit great tolerance to withstand the daily and seasonal
variability of its habitat. The organism is thought employ
homeostatic, or at least enantiostatic, mechanisms to enhance its
survivability. Recently, the induction of heat shock proteins has been
shown to occur in T. californicus in response to extremes of
temperature and salinity in the laboratory, suggesting that such
proteins may increase the organism's tolerance to adverse
environmental conditions in its natural habitat (Ha, 1993; McEvoy,
1993)
The heat-shock response, despite its somewhat limiting name,
may be elicited by a wide variety of stressors, including anoxia,
ethanol, heavy metals, amino acid analogues, inhibitors of oxidative
