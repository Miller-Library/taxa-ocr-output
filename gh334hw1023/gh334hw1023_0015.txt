Figure 1. Western blot with anti-HSP60 polyclonal antibody probe.
Samples obtained from various Tigriopus californicus populations at
Mussel Point. Twenty (20) ug samples of soluble protein derived
from laboratory animals maintained in 32%0 and 60%00 seawater
were loaded in lanes 1 and 2, respectively (numbered left to right).
Soluble protein (20ug) derived from in situ populations was loaded
in lanes 3 through 8. Order of these lanes, left to right, is as follows:
Pool A (33%/0), Pool Z (43.2%/0), Pool D(51.9%0), Pool X(60%/00), Pool
Y(72.8%0), and Pool X(78.7%/0). Prominent reaction occurs with
protein(s) at 58kD. Note cross-reactivities in lanes 3 and 6.
Figure 2. Histogram representing densitometric analysis of 58kD
band from Western blot. Units along the ordinate are O.D. X mm
(trace density). Animals of Pool X (lanes 6 and 8) apparently
produce higher levels of HSP60.
