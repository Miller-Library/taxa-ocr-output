INTRODUCTION
Information on predation of ascidians is scant and
can be found either in studies on the biology of an individual
predator (McDonald and Nybakken, 1980; Perron, 1975; Sellers,
1977; Yarnall, 1972) or in anedotal observations of pre¬
dation ontunicates (Ching, 1977; Gulliksen and Skjeveland,
1973; Lambert, 1980). Abbott and Newberry (1980) offers
the most current collection of tunicate predator information,

My goal was to obtain a survey of possible ascidian
predators here in the Monterey Bay area, specifically Pacific
Grove. At the same time I hoped to gain general information
about predator-ascidian relationships like feeding behavior,
tunicate response and damage.
Bow,
METHODS
The survey began with field observations in the inter-
tidal of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. Signs of
predation such as digested tunicate, missing zooids or
actual feeding behavior by predator suspects were noted.
Predator suspect is defined as a specimen of a recorded
predator, a relative of a recorded predator or any animal
associated with and suspected of eating tunicates.
Field observations, noting predator species, type
of tunicate and source of association (on or eating tunicate).
continued throughout the survey. Observations were made at
various times and tides in different areas throughout the
intertidal and subtidal of Hopkins Marine Station (HMS),
Eighteen species of predator suspects were brought into
the laboratory for feeding observations. All specimens were
collected from the intertidal or subtidal of HMS.
All animals except <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Megathura crenulata : Exact'>Megathura crenulata</span> were kept in
wire mesh cages or plastic tubs with fresh running sea water.
The animals were maintained under natural day and night light
only. Artificial light was eliminated as a preliminary class
study showed that some animals would not feed in bright arti¬
ficial light. Some species are noted to be inhibited by light
altogether (Lambert, 1980). A red light created by using
a dive light covered with a red plastic sheet provided light
to aid in night observations. Specimens of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Megathura : Exact'>Megathura</span> were
kept in an outside tank with running sea water and, thus,
were exposed to natural day and night light also. Animals

were starved for five days and allowed to get accustomed
to lab conditions before presenting tunicates,
Tunicate specimens used in feeding observations were
collected from the intertidal and subtidal at HMS, and from
the Monterey Marina floats <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Diplosoma macdonaldi : Exact'>(Diplosoma macdonaldi,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Botryllus : Exact'>Botryllus</span> spp.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Botrylloides : Exact'>Botrylloides</span> spp., and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ascidia ceratodes : Exact'>Ascidia ceratodes).</span> Colonies or
pieces of colonies, approximately 20 cm2 in surface area,
were tied to the bottom of the cages or tied to glass slides
and placed on cage bottoms to prevent predators from turning
over tunicates and eating them from the potentially injured
bottom of the colony.
A total of nineteen tunicate species were fed to
predator suspects. During an observation run one or more
individuals of a suspected predator species would be exposed
to equal amounts of six or seven species of ascidians for two
to three days. Observation runs were made until all suspects
had been exposed twice to all ninteen ascidians.
During the first 24 hours, observations were made every
one to two hours and every three to six hours thereafter,
Every observation was scored for successful feeding, feeding
activity without observed success, and association of predator
on tunicate species with no observable feeding activity.
After the two to three days of feeding, all tunicates were
removed from the cages and checked for any damage or effects
due to predation such as missing zooids or digested tunic.
During the observations, individual feeding behavior and
tunicate responses were noted.
Bow, 1981
RESULT
The laboratory feeding observations are summarized in
tables 1-5. The observations of feeding on each tunicate
species are summed up for all individual specimens of each
predator species. Therefore, the feeding patterns of indi¬
vidual predator specimens are not included.
Some predators show a strong association with one
prey species. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplidium californicum : Exact'>Aplidium californicum</span> was the only ascidian
species that <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Trivia solandri : Exact'>Trivia solandri</span> had been observed eating and

Although other tunicate species were eaten, <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Patiria miniata : PartialExact'>Patiria

ascidians. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Megatebennus bimaculatus : Exact'>Megatebennus bimaculatus</span> was found stronly

Some predator species exhibited behavior difficult to

successfully on <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. californicum</span> for a large portion of the

tidally from the kelp beds of HMS revealed sand, sponge

orange zooids, a partially digested lobe of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Aplidium arenatum : Exact'>Aplidium arenatum</span>
and whole <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Perophora annectens : Exact'>Perophora annectens</span> zooids amongst sponge spicules,

and sand.
Feeding Observations:
With the exception of a polyclad flatworm, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Eurylepta californica : Exact'>Eurylepta
californica,</span> and the bat star Patiria miniata, the other
predators found were eight species of gastropods, three of
which are keyhole limpets. These three are <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Diodora aspera : Exact'>Diodora aspera,</span>
Megatebennus bimaculatus, and Megathura crenulata and they
eat both the zooids and the tunic. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Diodora : Exact'>Diodora</span> uses the outer
lips of the mouth to form a suction that pulls the prey up
to open jaws. The radula makes one or two strokes, tearing
off tissue. Then the jaws close, cutting off any threads
hanging from the radula.
Megathura and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Megatebennus : Exact'>Megatebennus</span> probably eat in a somewhat
similar fashion. The mantle of these two limpets covers the
head region of the animal, making it difficult to follow
Bow, 1981
the exact mechanism of feeding. Gouging bite marks left
in tunicates fed to Megathura and Megatebennus suggests
that the mouth is applied to the tunicate surface, jaws
agape, while the radula rasps up masses of tunicate tissue,
While the exact mechanism used by Calliostoma ligatum
was not directly observed, it seems feasible that the
mechanism would be similar to the feeding behavior of
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Calliostoma annulatum : Exact'>Calliostoma annulatum</span> observed by Perron (1975). <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. ligatum</span>
crawls across the tunicate surface, tasting the surface with
its mouth and tentacles. It raises its head with the mouth
open and in a sudden jabbing motion, lunges at its prey,
Its mouth attaches to the prey and the head rocks up and
down as the tunicate zooid is drawn into the mouth.
The feeding mechanism of Hermissenda crassicornis is
well described by Yarnall (1972). The rocking action of the
buccal sac as it pumps, sucking up the zooids, is accompanied
by a jerking movement of the ceratae from a relaxed, ex¬
tended position to a position lieing flat against the body,
The feeding method of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lamellaria diegoensis : Exact'>Lamellaria diegoensis</span> is
described by Fretter and Graham (1962) and Lambert (1980).
The mantle covering the shell of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lamellaria : Exact'>Lamellaria</span> spreads out over
the periphery of the animal, concealing the actions of the
mouth. In order to determine feeding, the animal had to
be removed and the tunicate inspected for signs of predation
(hole in tunic).
The feeding behavior of prosobranchs Trivia solandri
and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Erato vitellina : Exact'>Erato vitellina,</span> and the bat star Patiria miniata is
Bow, 1981
described in Abbott and Haderlie (1980).
<span style='background-color:grey' title='Eurylepta californica : Fuzzy'>Eurvlepta californica</span> is often found wrapped over the
siphons of Clavelina. When it eats, the mouth and pharynx
extend down through one of the siphons
and
sucks in the zooid. As the flatworm's mouth and pharynx
extend deeper into the tunic, the central part of the body
folds into the tunic through the siphon. The pharynx and
gut of the zooid are ingested by the flatworm.

DISC
SSION
To try and get the closest correlation of tunicate
predators with their preferred prey species, a point system
was employed which included not only successful feeding
observations, but also the attempts at feeding where success
could not be determined, along with observations of association
of the predator with tunicate species. By giving each type
of observation a weighted numerical value based on the
assumption that a predator eats more of, or associates more
with, its preferred food, each tunicate species receives a
number that represents the predator's preference for that
species. (figure 1)
All tunicates that were ranked most preferred had been
successfully preyed upon by their prospective predators.
whereas only half of the second and third most preferred
tunicates were successfully eaten. The result that all of
the most preferred tunicates were successfully eaten may be
taken as a positive indication of the appropriateness of
the point system in ranking preferences. The quick drop
in positive correlation for the second and third choices
may be explained by: 1) The occurance of specialized preda¬
tors that eat only one or two tunicate species. 2) Sometimes
a predator specimen spent a significant amount of observation
time sitting on a tunicate, using it as a substrate and not
trying to eat it. 3) In some cases active feeding behavior
was repeatedly observed on the same prey species without
Bow, 1981
observed success. This may be due to a zooid-escape response
or the predator may be grazing material on the tunic surface,
Predators like <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hermissenda : Exact'>Hermissenda</span> and Calliostoma who eat
only the zooids may be unsuccessful in feeding attempts
because the zooids contract down into the protection of the
tunic when disturbed by predator foraging. This same con¬
traction-escape response can be elicited by poking or
rubbing the tunic surface with a dissecting probe,
Predators such as Megathura, Megatebennus and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Patiria : Exact'>Patiria</span>
that eat both the zooid and tunic were observed either eating
or not eating which resulted in scored feeding rates of
100% success. (tables 2 and 5). Even though the zooids are
withdrawn, the tunic-plus-zooid-eaters are usually success¬
ful as they eat right through the tunic until the zooids are
available for feeding.
Sand encrusted tunicates such as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Synoicum parfustis : Exact'>Synoicum parfustis,</span>
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Euherdmania claviformis : Exact'>Euherdmania claviformis</span> and sandy lobes, excape successful
predation by zooid-only-eaters. The sand provides an
extra barrier of protection for the zooids. These tunicates
were successfully eaten only by Megathura and Patiria, both
voracious zooid-plus-tunic-eaters.
Overall, A. californicum is the most preferred tunicate,
Clavelina ranks second and A. psammion is one of the third
most preferred species. (figure 2) This preference may
correlate directly with the intertidal abundance of species
as these top three choices simultaneously rank the same in
abundance intertidally (Pulliam, 1981). The predators may

have already been conditioned to eating one of the top three
species in the field, so when brought into lab, they continued
to feed on the same favored species. Many of the Megatebennus
and Diodora specimens were collected either on or near
A. californicum, and did, in fact, favor A. californicum
during lab feedings.
There appears to be no definite coorelation between
body form (solitary, social or compound) and the degree of
predation. (tables 1-5) and figures 1 and 2)
Both
A. californicum and Clavelina, the top two choices, are
non-ascidic and contain low concentrations of vanadium,
whereas <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Euherdmania : Exact'>Euherdmania</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Distaplia occidentalis : Exact'>Distaplia occidentalis,</span> the two least
predated species, contain high concentrations of vanadium
(Abbott and Newberry, 1980). However, A. psammion also
contains high vanadium concentrations and has a pH of 1-2.
yet ranks number three. Though there may exist chemical
defenses against predation, they certainly do not offer a
complete means of protection.
Feeding studies of individual predators would be use¬
ful in determining the importance of tunicates in predator
diets. The rarer species <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Trivia : Exact'>Trivia,</span> Lamellaria and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Erato : Exact'>Erato</span> tend
to be specialists, eating only one or two tunicate species
(figure 3). These would be interesting to study, but their
rarity may make it difficult to accumulate data.
The two nost common predators, Hermissenda and Patiria,
ate a larger variety of ascidian species (seven and eight,
respectively). These certainly would lend themselves to
Bow, 1981
﻿12
more investigation especially in the field. In lab Megathura
was found to eat the greatest number of tunicates, a total
of 14 species. Despite the lack of feeding observations,
they do eat ascidians in the field as the gut analysis shows.
These large animals are known to occur in abundance and may
prove to be a profitable predator for further study.
Megatebennus was primarily found in areas of high surge
where water was well ciculated or was brought in to lab with
subtidal tunicate specimens. It was found mostly on
A. californicum and in addition, often resembled the color of
the tunicate with which it was associated. All the ascidians
which it ate in lab occur in intertidal areas of high surge.
Many of the animals in sea water tables became sick unless
a hose was positioned with its excurrent flowing directly
through the cage. This suggests that Megatebennus prefers
a habitat with a high turnover of water. Perhaps this in¬
formation will be useful in locating specimens in later studies.
It would be best to obtain data on tunicate predators
from actual field observations; however, it was difficult to
observe many instances of feeding in the field. (figure 4)
In collecting data in the laboratory, 184 hours were spent
observing suspected predators and potential prey. This
yielded 147 observations of actual feeding. In contrast,
80 hours were spent looking for predation in the field and
only 15 feeding observations were made.
Perhaps predators have their most significant impact
during larval stages or on newly settled and young adult stages.

SUMMAR
Based on lab and field observations, the following ten
1)
animals were observed feeding on ascidians: fissurellid
gastropods; Diodora aspera, Megatebennus bimaculatus, and
Megathura crenulata; other prosobranchs; Calliostoma
ligatum, Erato vitellina, Lamellaria diegoensis, and
Trivia solandri; the opisthobranch Hermissenda
crassicornis; the bat star Patiria miniata; and the
polyclad flatworm Eurylepta californica.
A point system was applied to feeding observations to
obtain a correlation between tunicate species and
predator preferences.
The three most abundant species of tunicates in the
field, Aplidium californicum, Clavelina huntsmani, and
Archidistoma psammion, were found to be the three most
predated tunicates in lab.
The less common predator species Erato, Lamellaria and
Trivia appear to specialize on one or two tunicate
species, Hermissenda, Patiria and Megathura are
more general in their choices, eating a variety of
seven or more ascidian species.
The fissurellid gastropods, Lamellaria and the bat star
eat both tunic and zooids. The other prosobranch gastro-
pods, opisthobranch and polyclad flatworm eat only the
zooids.

on tunicate species. Success was determined by
actually seeing the zooid or tunicate material
pass into the predator or by strong evidence
such as missing zooids or digested tunic.
o/+ -- Observed feeding behavior, but found no evidence
for success.

Figure 1
Preferences and Predation based on lab observations.
The numbers indicate each predator's preference for
a tunicate species; number 1 being the most preferred
and larger numbers for the less preferred species.
The same scoring symbols used in tables 1-5 are
shown to indicate each predators observed reaction
to each tunicate species.

Predation based on Field Observations.
The same scoring symbols used in tables 1-5 were
employed to score observations made in the field.
Double symbols, o, +, +, indicate observations
that were seen in the field but not in the lab.
+ -- observed successful feeding
qy+ -- observed feeding behavior but success undetermined
undetermined
o -- predator observed on tunicate but no feeding
activity exhibited
Blank spaces mean that no interaction was observed
between the predator and tunicate species.
