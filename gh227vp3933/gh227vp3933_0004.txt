appeared to be a pore. Under oil immersion counts were
taken of cnidocysts in the ectoderm in the field of view at
the tip, middle and base of the verrucae. Another ver-
ruca tip in the same section was also counted (Table 2).
Only spirocysts and basitrichs were identified in this
section. The counts indicate there is a gradient in the
density of spirocysts in the verrucalar ectoderm. The
density is greatest in a ring at the verruca tip. Hand
(1955) indicates there are cinclides at the tips of the
verrucae in Anthopleura elegantissima which could account
for the indication of a pore seen in one section (not
illustrated).

Hand'describes the cnidom of the column as consisting
of atrichs and basitrichs. He does not mention the
presence of spirocysts on the column, but he did not
examine the cnidom of verrucae specifically. In addition
to spirocysts some basitrichs were identified in the
sections of verrucae. No other types of cnidocysts were
observed.
Mechanism of Attachment
The fact that occassionally verrucae tips were
torn off when gravel cover was plucked from an anemone
indicates how strongly verrucae can adhere. Some obser-
