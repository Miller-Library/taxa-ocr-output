Discussion
The indication from these experiments is that the
ability of an anemone to capture gravel bits with its
verrucae is directly related to the availability of
gravel to the anemone. Considering that spirocysts are
required for adhesion of gravel to verrucae, the opportun-
istic nature of this correlation can be understood.
None of the experimental animals came close to achieving
100% gravel cover under the experimental conditions used,
The experimental results do indicate that the method
of presentation may affect the amount of gravel an an-
emone attaches to itself. It seems anemones that have
a longer time to attach to gravel before being subjected
to conditions which act to remove loosely adhered gravel
should cover themselves more completely.
It is conceivable that in the field after a wave
showers anemones with sand, much gravel will settle on
and around the anemones. This mode of presentation of
gravel would seem to allow more time for adhesion than
the few moments an anemone has if sand is supplied only
during short surges of the surf, which my experiments
were designed to simulate.
Another aspect of gravel cover that still needs to
be investigated is turnover of attached gravel. The
