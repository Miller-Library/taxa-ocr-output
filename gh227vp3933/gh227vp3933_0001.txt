Introduction
Small clonal and large solitary individuals of the
sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima,occur predominantly
on rocks in the intertidal zone from Alaska to Southern
California (Hand, 1955). In many situations these anem-
ones cover all or part of the column with small gravel,
bits of shell, or algae. The covering materials adhere
strongly to the verrucae on the column (Hand, 1955).
The present investigation was conducted to deter-
mine how the anemones attach gravel to themselves, and
to ascertain the relation betweenithe availability
gravel and the amount of gravel actually attached to
anemones. The facilities at Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California were
used to conduct all aspects of this investigation.
Gross Morphology, Distribution,
and Number of Verrucae
The gross morphology of the verrucae of 8 cloneÂ¬
mates used in experiments to be described later was
studied. The anemones were first relaxed in Mgcl2 solu-
tion isotonic with seawater for 4 hours then individually
examined under a dissecting microscope in a bowl of sea
water.
