or between clonemates. Also, there appears to be no
correlation between the number of complete columns and the
size of anemone as measured by bouyant weight or body
dimensions. The data obtained are not complete enough
to allow further generalizations. It was not possible
to obtain quick estimates of the number of verrucae
per anemone.
Microscopic Structure of Verrucae
To study the microscopic morphology of verrucae,
frozen sections of an anemone fixed in 10% formalin sol-
ution were cut at 32 microns using an international cry-
ostat microtome. Figure 2 illustrates the salient features
of a longitudinal section of a verruca. The absence of
zooxanthellae in the gastrodermis at the very tip of
verrucae may help to explain the offwhite color of the
patches at the tips of the verrucae.
The distribution of cnidocysts around the verrucae
tip was studied. Cnidocysts were identified using il-
lustrations of the cnidom of Anthopleura elegantissima
(Hand, 1955). Nearly all cnidae observed lay in the
ectoderm; exceptions were 7 spirocysts observed in
zooxanthella laden gastrodermis when the tissue was first
resolved, and 9 spirocysts that were resolved in the
gastrodermis at the tip of the verrucae in an area that
