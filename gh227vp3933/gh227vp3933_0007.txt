their adhering gravel the first week in lab, but still
retained some after 3 weeks. No studies of turnover
rate of covering material were carried out.
Relation between Gravel
Availability and Amount of Cover
Preliminary observations
In the field, Anthopleura elegantissima were seen
bearing some gravel cover whether they were on horizontal
or vertical rock faces. In the laboratory it was obser-
ved that anemones collect small gravel on the column if
they are simply buried in it or if it is presented to
them in a fast moving current of water. The latter
observation suggests that wave action can make water
borne gravel and shells available to anemones regardless
of their orientation. Wave borne gravel appears to be
the only source of many anemones in the intertidal zone.
It was interesting to observe that some anemones sub-
jected to the scouring action of gravel in a water current
in the lab swelled their verrucae shortly after exposure
was begun. The same response was observed in anemones
that contracted when they were probed several times with
a dissecting needle. The swelling of verrucae in response

to abrasion would seem to be'behavior'facilitating gravel
