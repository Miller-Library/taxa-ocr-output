pick up. Other than this behavior, throughout the course
of this study, Anthopleura elegantissima was never ob-
served to actively "reach" for gravel with
tentacles
or by bending the column down to contact the substratum.
Field observations suggest that gravel cover present
on anemones is related in part, at least, to the avail-
ability of gravel. Anemones observed at the water level
on the Monterey wharf pilings several meters above the
bottom are essentially bare of gravel cover. Only an
occassional anemone here
had a few bits of attached
shell. At the other extreme,anemones on flat rocks
lying low in the sand and subjected to much washing by
surf, are profusely covered by sand gravel. In many
places along the Monterey peninsula it was seen that
anemones on rocks more distant from beds of sand had
observably less gravel cover than anemones that were
closer to a source of gravel. It seems reasonable that
a difference in gravel availability might account, at
least in part, for the difference in amount of cover
observed on anemones. To test this hypothesis 3 exper-
iments testing different aspects of availability were
conducted.
