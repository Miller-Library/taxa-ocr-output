4. Only gravel contacting verrucae directly is available
for capture. Gravel can be picked up in a fast moving
current of water. Wave borne gravel appears to be the
only source of cover to many anemones in the intertidal
zone. Anemones poked or subjected to scouring by water
borne gravel swell their verrucae. Anemones were never
observed to pick up gravel with their tentacles of by
bending the column down to contact the substratum.
5. In many places anemones on rocks distant from beds of
sand had less gravel cover than anemones closer to a
source of gravel.
6. Experiments with anemones exposed to gravel carried
by rapidly swirling water (simulating waves and cur-
rents) show that: (1) gravel cover increases with
successive exposures to scouring with gravel, (2) with
longer duration of exposure to gravel, and (3) with
greater amounts of gravel present in the scouring
water. Presenting gravel to anemones in rapidly mov-
ing water seems to limit the degree of gravel cover
they can acquire. The mode of presentation of gravel
seems to be related to the amount of gravel an anemone
attaches to itself.
