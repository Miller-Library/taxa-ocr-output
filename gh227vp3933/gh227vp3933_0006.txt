crabs on which it settled. Mariscal also observed spiro-
cysts and prepared a scanning electron photomicrograph
of the thread of a discharged spirocyst. He noted that
a web of microfibrillae extends from the shaft of the
discharged spirocyst thread and noted that this feature
might enable spirocysts to function in an adhesive cap-
acity. Anthopleura elegantissima has spirocysts in
other parts of the body, but spirocysts attach strongly
to foreign objects only at or near the verrucae tips.
(Occassionally gravel was noted to adhere to tentacles,
but not for more than a fraction of a second) Spirocyst
depletion and the occurence of a cinclide in verrucae
tips might help explain the sharp decline in spirocyst
number of the very tip of the verrucae shown in Table 2,
Two other observations were made incidental to the
above studies. First, gravel presented to an anemone
denuded of cover adhered better after 24 hours than it
did only an hour after it attached. Perhaps more time
allows more spirocysts to attach. The observation sug-
gests that the longer gravel is attached the better it
adheres. However this may not be the case. A second
observation suggests the attached life of a piece of
gravel may be limited. Seven anemones collected in the
field and transferred to plastic tanks with slowly
running seawater and constant illumination lost much of
