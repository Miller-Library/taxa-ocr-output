for any such anemone was 8, indicating animals attained
virtually 100 % cover. All experimental results are there¬
fore reported in terms of percent of the maximum gravel
cover attained (bouyant weight).
The relation between anemone bouyant weight and
bouyant weight of maximum possible gravel cover for every
anemone used in experiments is shown in Fig. 4. The
data support a general positive correlation between
the size of an anemone and the amount of gravel it can
carry.
rst experiment
This experiment was conducted with 14 anemone to
test whether or not, other things being constant, there
is a relation between frequency of exposure and amount
of cover an anemone bears. In the experiment anemones
were exposed intermittantly to agitated water and sand.
1.5g bouyant weight of gravel was added to each beaker
and agitated as described for one minute. Gravel re-
maining loose after one minute was poured out of the
beaker and the anemone with its gravel cover was weighed.
The exposure procedure was repeated at one hour inter¬
vals 5 times. In between exposures the animals were
kept in beakers of gently flowing seawater.
