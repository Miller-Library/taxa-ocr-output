experimental data and observations indicate that anemones
do loose attached gravel, and so to effectively evaluate
the relation between gravel availability and amount of
cover, this parameter must be taken into consideration.
Summary
1. Gravel and other debris is often attached to the tips
of verrucae on the sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantis
sima.
2. Small simple and compound verrucae occur on the distal
1/4of the column; only large simple verucae occur on
the proximal 3/4 of the column. Verrucae occur in longi¬
tudinal rows; some rows extending from the top of the
column to the base, other rows are present only near
the top. The numbers of verrucae in complete longitudinal
rows varies around the column of an anemone.
3. Gravel adheres only to the tips of verrucae. Many spi-
rocysts and some basitrichs occur in the ectoderm of
verrucae; the density of spirocysts is greatest near
the tips of verrucae, declines at the verrucal sides,
and approaches zero near the base. Spirocysts enable
verrucäe to adhere to objects, perhaps by means of
microfibrallae extending from the shafts of everted
threads.
