this experiment are consistent with the results of Ex-
periment one: gravel cover increases with greater avail-
ability until an upper limit seems to be reached, but
this upper limit is scarcely a third of the maximum
gravel-carrying capacity of the animals tested.
Third experiment
In the third experiment gravel availability was
varied by varying the amount of gravel presented to
anemones during exposure of fixed duration. Using 0.5.
1, and 2 grams (bouyant weight) of gravel, three groups
of 6 to 8 anemones were exposed to agitated gravel and
seawater once for 4 minutes. The results are shown in
figure 7. The T value significance levels (Table 5)
indicate the change in percent maximum gravel cover at-
tained between anemones exposed to 0.5 and 2g of gravel
is statistically significant. This result quantitatively
supports a positive correlation between the amount of
gravel in the water and the amount of gravel an anemone
covers itself with under the conditions of the experiment.
