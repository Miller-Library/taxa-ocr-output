the experiment was performed. The standard sand used
in the experiment was sifted by a 2.00mm mesh screen
and retained by a.991mm mesh screen. Eleven samples of
25 sand grains each were counted out and their bouyant
weights taken. Weights for the 25 grain samples ranged
from 107-140mg: mean 119mg, standard deviation 8.25,
standard error of the mean 2.49. It can be judged that
the error due to gravel bouyant weight variance intro-
duced in measuring gravel cover by bouyant weight was
not appreciable. Because the water content in anemones
varies with their degree of contraction, all weights
reported are bouyant weights determined to the nearest mg
by immersing the anemone plus petri dish lid to which it
adhered in a beaker of sea water. The plate was suspended
by its nylon thread from a torsion balance. Initial
weights of the anemones were taken before the experiment.
The ability of each anemone to cover itself maximally
with gravel was determined at the end of all experiments
in which that anemone was used. This was done by burying
the anemone in gravel and comparing the weights of the
anemone without cover and with maximum cover. Counts
of the number of exposed bare verrucae were taken on
each anemone when it had attained maximum gravel cover
in order to express what further capacity the anemones
had to attach gravel. The greatest count of bare verrucae
