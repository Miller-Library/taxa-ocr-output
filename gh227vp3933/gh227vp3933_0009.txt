Experimental Methods
Forty-three anemones all clone-mates and denuded of
sand, were established on separate plastic petri dish
lids 5 cm in diameter. To facilitate adhesion of the
anemones, fine sand was glued to the surface of the petri
dish lids with 5 minute epoxy and allowed to dry. A
loop of nylon thread was tied to a hole in the edge of
each lid so that anemone and dish together could be easily
weighed. an anemone was placed on each lid, allowed to
attach, and was dept on the lid through all subsequent
operations. The lids with anemones fitted loosely in
the bottom of 150 ml beakers measuring 5.5 cm X 8 cm.
Animals were thus maintained in separate beakers provided
with running seawater between experiments.
Sand weighed to the nearest 0.1 g bouyant weight
using a beam balance was poured in along the side of
the beakers without touching the anemones. It was made
available to the anemone by agitating the water and gravel
in the beaker with clockwise and counter-clockwase motions
of a jet of sea water directed through a retainer screen
at the top of each beaker. The water pressure was stand-
ardized by adjusting the water flow so that from a heighth
of 3.5 cm the jet from the 3/8 inch nozzle used shot
16 cm up the 3 degree incline of the sea table on which
