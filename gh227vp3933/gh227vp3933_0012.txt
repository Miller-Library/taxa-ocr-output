During the experiments it was noted that some anem-
ones were attached at the centers of their plastic lids,
others near one side. Because anemones near the sides
of their lids were observed to be subjected to more scour
of gravel than anemones in the centers of their lids,
results are reported according to the position of the
anemones on the lid in Fig. 5.
Figure 5 shows the % of maximum gravel cover attained
by anemones on the centers and sides of lids after each
exposure. A composite curve for all 14 anemones, with
means, ranges, and standard deviations is shown at the top,
The T value significance levels of the differences in the
percent of maximum gravel cover on anemones classified
as center and side is presented in Table 3. T value
significance levels for the differences in cover between
exposures for side, center, and composite groups are
also tabulated.
The difference in Zmaximum cover attained by side
and center anemones is statistically significant fol-
lowing the first 2 exposures, but does not satisfy the
95% criterium for significance after the last 3 exposures.
In general, the composite graph for the 14 anemones
represents the gravel cover gained by this clone of an-
emones after each exposure. The percent of maximum gravel
