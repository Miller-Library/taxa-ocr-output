vations and simple experiments were conducted to throw
light on the mechanism of adhesion.
Verrucae were probed at various points with a dis-
section needle and the only tissue noted to be readily
adherent was allthe whitish patchs at the tips of ver-
rucae. Next, numerous small fragments of cover slips
were presented at verruca tips, allowed to attach, and
then pulled off and examined microscopically. The best
fired
of such preparations revealed a mass of cnidocysts. By
cutting off a verucca tip attached to a cover slip a
preparation was obtained which showed both the attach-
ment spot on the cover slip and the verruca tip itself,
separated by a cleft more than 500microns wide which was
spanned by a mass of cnidocyst threads (figure 3).
The only possible explanation for the physical attach-
ment of the tissue to the cover slip was the mass of threads
extending from tissue to glass. Because true nemato-
cysts were scarce here, and the mass consisted very largely
of partially fired spirocysts and empty spirocyst capÂ¬
sules, there can be no doubt that it is the spirocysts
which enable verrucae to adhere to objects.
Other cases of cnidocyst adhesion have been docu-
mented. Mariscal (1972) found that basitrichs were the
primary nematocysts enabling the sea anemone Calliactus
tricolor to attach its tentacles to shells of hermit
