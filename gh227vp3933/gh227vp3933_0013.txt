attained increases with the first two exposures but later
levels off at a value less than half the maximum gravel
cover capacity of these anemones. Considering the fluc-
tuations in gravel cover in individual anemones it is
evident that anemones lost gravel as well as gained it
in successive exposures. As noted previously, verrucae
seem to adhere more strongly to gravel given more time
for attachment. It seems likely therefore, that the
surge of water the anemones were subjected to could act
to detach loose gravel recently picked up.
Second experiment
This experiment was conducted to ascertain if,
other things being constant, there was a relation between
the duration of exposure to gravel and the final amount
of gravel cover. For this experiment 7 anemones were
exposed only once to agitated seawater and gravel for
intervals of 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 minutes. Two grams of gravel
(bouyant weight) were used in each exposure.
The results are shown in Fig. 6. T value signi-
ficance levels (Table 4) indicate that the increase in
gravel cover shown between animals exposed for 0.5 minutes
and those exposed for 1 minute is statistically signi-
ficant. After 1 minute of exposure there is no signi¬
ficant change in the amount of covér. The results of
