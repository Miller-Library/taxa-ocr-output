INTRODUCTION
Two sympatric species of Anthopleura are found in the
and
local intertidal which seem to occupy different types of
habitat with some overlap. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anthopleura xanthogrammica : Exact'>Anthopleura xanthogrammica</span>
(Brandt, 1835) is generally seen lower in the intertidal
and in more surf swept areas than <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anthopleura elegantissima : Exact'>Anthopleura elegantissima</span>
(Brandt, 1835). Suspecting this habitat difference may
be correlated with metabolic differences, studies of oxygen
consumption of the two species were made. Sassaman and
Mangum (1972) measured the oxygen consumption for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Haloclava producta : Exact'>Haloclava
producta</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Metridium senile : Exact'>Metridium senile</span> and found that Metridium
senile from a higher oxygen environment had a higher oxygen
consumption rate at the sôme oxygen concentration at (air
saturation).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All the animals used in this study were taken from the
rocky intertidal area at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California. Several of each of the two species of
Anthopleura were taken from three different tidal levels.
Several <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. xanthogrammica</span> were taken from an exposed point
where no A. elegantissima were seen. All anemones were
allowed to settle for at least three days to check for
trauma. During settling and between measurements the
Oxygen Consumption in <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Anthopleura : PartialExact'>Anthopleura
anemones</span> were left in running sea water at 12°0.
Measurements were made in a Scholander (1949) type
respirometer with compensating chambers and with a Warburg
respirometer. Volume compensation in the Scholander respir¬
ometer was with oxygen to maintain a constant partial
pressure of oxygen.
Measurements were made in a running sea water bath at
12°C. The running water current moving the chambers and
the ciliary activity of the anemone provided the only
mixing.
Readings were taken every fifteen minutes for four
hours or more. A mean volume change was calculated along
with standard deviation and standard error of the mean.
The b value for the log-log plot of the weight regression
was calculated and tested for significance with the Student's
T test.
Measurements taken over prolonged periods, seventeen
hours, with the Scholander respirometer revealed negligible
changes in the running mean volume change from that during
the first four hours. Blanks run under each set of conditions
showed negligible volume changes.
Both sample and compensating chambers were covered with
aluminum foil for dark conditions. Uncovered glass chambers
were in light at an intensity of sixty foot candles for
the Scholander respirometer and forty foot candles for the
Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
Warburg respirometer.
All animals were dryed for twenty four hours to a
constant weight within 0.01 grams (Brafield and Chapman, 1965).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Oxygen consumption rates in ul O/hour/gram dry wt.
under four different conditions for both A. elegantissima
and A. xanthogrammica are organized in Table One. Average
variation for repetitive measurements for single anemones
at different times at an average dark submerged oxygen
consumption rate of 21.5 ul 0/hour/ gram dry wt. was
+ 13.8 ul O/hour/gram dry wt. The variation in the differ-
ence in oxygen consumption rates under different light
conditions, at different tidal levels and between the two
species is as large or larger than the variation in oxygen
consumption rates for a single anemone. Therefore these
differences can not be established with my data.
One point of interest is the increased oxygen consump¬
tion rates in dry animals vs.submerged animals by a factor
of two or three. When submerged in sea water the anemone
is expanded exposing a greater surface area for exchange.
The partial pressure of oxygen in both air and sea water in
equilibrium with each other should be the same. Since the
anemones run for long periods submerged do not show a progresswe
reduction in respiratory rate it is assumed that the water
Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
is maintained in approximate equilibrium. This all
indicates that aquatic respiration would be more favor¬
able, but aerial respiration is consistently greater.
The volume of oxygen in the air is forty times greater
than in an equal volume of water and the rate of diffusion
of oxygen is 324,000 times greater in air. Together
these two factors make the supply of oxygen in air to
respiratory tissue more effective, indicating that covering
by the tide limits the anemone's metabolic rate. One
advantage of the preferred habitat of A. xanthogrammica
on surf swept rocks is the presence of super saturated
sea water to enhance metabolic rate.
The log-log plot of weight regression for A. elegantissima
in Graph One reveals a good correlation between the oxygen
consumption rates using the Scholander respirometer and
the Warburg respirometer. The b value was calculated to
consideva
be 0.20 which is significantly different from the O.65
b value found for Metridium senile (Sassaman and Mangum, 1970
and the 0.75 b value found for several other intertidal
invertebrates (Newell, 1970). The low b value indicates
that larger anemones are not dramatically changing the
morphology or physiology of the metabolizing tissue.
The value above zero may be accounted for by some enlargement
of individual cells in larger anemones and for burying of
cells in the larger masses of tissues, thus increasing the
diffusion path for oxygen. I can not account for the
Oxygen Consumption in Anthopleura
difference between my b value and the higher ones reported
by other authors for different species of sea anemones.
However a low b value for anemones seems quite expected
by me.
SUMMARY
There is a large variation in oxygen consumption rates
for both A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica.
Aerial respiration was found to be two to three times
greater than submerged respiration for both species.
A b value found for A. elegantissima was calculated
to be 0.20. This is quite different from b values for
other anemones and other intertidal invertebrates, but
seems expected.
