0300 hours for a 24-hour period. This duration of low water
simulated the duration of low tide at the time and location from
which the animals were collected. Response time and temperature
were recorded every two hours except for a 4-hour break in the
48-hour experiments.
Experiments to test the affects of water disturbance upon
activity were conducted in three aquaria, each containing 20
animals and placed under the three light regimes previously de-
scribed. Water disturbance was created in the aquaria by a 120-
volt, AC electrio stirrer connected to a timing device allowing
the motor to run for 4 seconds, stop for 9 seconds, and run for
4 seconds repeatedly for six hours, after which six hours of
quiescence followed. This cycle was repeated for 24 hours.
The response time and temperature were recorded every two hours.
In all experiments, the flow rate in the aquaria was ad-
justed to between 1240 ml/min and 1320 ml/min in order to keep
the dilution rate of squid water the same. During times of low
water in the tidal rhythm experiment the squid-water was diluted
by the appropriate amount to account for the reduced volume of
seawater.
Laboratory animals were trapped as previously described.
Males and non-brooding females will satiate themselves if given
a large enough piece of food and will not eat for a week or two
afterward. Presumably they will not respond to a food stimulus
