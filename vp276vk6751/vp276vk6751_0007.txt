during this time so the traps selected for hungry males and non-
brooding females. This eliminated a potentially large source
of error in response time in the laboratory. Animals were used
no longer than 8 hours after collection. They were allowed
approximately 6 hours to acclimatize to the experimental conditons.
SULTS
Field study. Original data showed that variations in temperature.
wave period and wave height were insufficient to account for
changes in activity, and the patterns in the fluctuations of
these faotors did not correlate with fluotuations in activity
levels, as shown in Figure 3.
The activity pattern of the field population is presented
in Figures 4-6 which present both the number of animals found
as a function of time and the water depth at trap sites 6. 7.
8, and 9, respectively. Due to an unexpectedly low tide on May
28 traps 1-5 were above water throughout the entire 6-hour
period. Consequently data from these traps were not collected.
No more than one animal appeared in trap 10 at any time so the
results were not presented.
Figure 4-a shows that peak activity occured at 0100 hours.
This the is the time at which the water level reached 25 cm.
Figure 5-a shows peak activity again occured at 0100 hours.
Figure 5-b shows the close correlation between time of peak
activity and the time at which the water level reached 25 cm.
