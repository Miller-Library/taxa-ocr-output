chiltoni, has demonstrated that activity patterns in this animal
are closely tied to tidal rhythms (Enright, 1965). This species
remains buried in the sand except during a 4- to 6-hour interval
shortly after the tidal crest on the beach of collection, and
the swirling action of the surf (as simulated in lab) initiates
the pattern of activity.
Isopod ecology studies performed at Hopkins Marine Station
in 1973 suggested that within the period of high activity during
nighttime hours there is a sharp peak in activity that has not
been correlated to any obvious environmental factor.
Finally, it has been shown that the benthic intertidal
amphipod Synchelidium spp. shows bursts of swimming activity in
response to small, short-term changes in hydrostatic pressure
which may be experienced by the animals as waves peak just before
breaking. This may be a mechanism by which the animals maintain
themselves in this zone (Digby, 1961). A similar situation may
exist in C. harfordi.
The purpose of the present investigation was to establish
the activity patterns of C. harfordi and to identify the environ-
mental factors which were most influential upon these patterns.
The factors which were felt to be the most important were light,
depth of water, disturbance of substrate in which the animals
occur, and water temperature.
