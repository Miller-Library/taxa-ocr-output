INTRODUCTION
lirolana harfordi is a marine isopod which occurs most
abundantly under rocks in the high intertidal zone from British
Columbia to at least Ensenada (Ricketts and Calvin, 1968).
The animal has also been observed at night actively swimming in
the swirling water of breaking waves (author, personal obser-
vation). Of the relatively small amount of information accumulated
on C. harfordi very little has been directed toward the ecological
relationships between the animal and its environment.
Investigation of the aspects of feeding and energetics
in C. harfordi has shown, among other things, that although it
will actively seek bait in the form of pieces of fish during
both day and night, activity is higher during the night than
during the day (Johnson, 1973). Although generally considered to
be a scavanger, Johnson feels they are primarily predators upon
marine invertebrates such as small marine annelids. Brooding
females are known to go for months at a time without eating
anything. Ecological work on another cirolanid, Excirolana
