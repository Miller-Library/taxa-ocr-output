Figuro 6-a shows that the activity peak occured at 0200 hours,
an hour later than in any of the othor previous graphs. Figure
6-b shows that water depth reached its shallowest point between
2400 and 0200 hours. Peak activity oocured within this time in-
terval. Figure 7-a shows that a much lower peak occured an hour
later, corresponding to the ebbing tide which was occuring at
this time. The water depth never even approached the 25 cm
depth found in Figures 4, 5, and 6. The corresponding activity
level did not approach the height that it did in Figures 4,
5. and 6. Figure 8 shows that a definite peak in activity occured
at the 20-40 cm depth interval, corresponding to the peaks in
activity found at the time the water level was 25 cm at traps
6 and 7, and corresponding to the lower peaks of activity which
occured at the time minimum depth was reached at traps 8 and 9.
Laboratory study. The results from the experiments testing
the effect of light on activity patterns are represented in
Figures 9-a through 9-c. The response times shown here are aver-
aged response times from three different experiments. A response
time above 9.5 minutes was considered no response since after
8 minutes the response-time determination was ended in one ex-
periment and after 10 minutes it was ended in two other exper-
iments. Activity level was much lower (higher response time)
in constant light than in constant dark. No significance was
ascribed to the fluctuations during the 24-hour test period in
