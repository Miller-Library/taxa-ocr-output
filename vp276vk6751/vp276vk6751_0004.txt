squid from being eaten. The bait was replaced every three
hours. Since preliminary experiments showed essentially no
activity during daylight hours traps were checked every hour
from 1800 to 2400 hours on one night and from 2400 to 0600
hours the following night. As traps were collected depth,
temperature, wave period, and wave height were recorded.
Laboratory study. The behavior of C. harfordi in the laboratory
made it a difficult subject in which to determine patterns of
activity. If placed in a tub of seawater the animals ceaselessly
swam about and showed continuous activity. If running seawater
was placed in the tub the animals oriented toward the current
and eventually crawled up the hose and invaded the seawater system.
The experimental chambers therefore consisted of aquaria with
one rock and 5 cm of sand on the bottom. Each rock was weighed
to insure all aquaria contained a rock of similar size. These
conditions closely matched the natural under-rock habitat of the
animal. Once the animals were introduced into the aquaria
they immediately burrowed into the sand or under the rock and
remained there for indefinite periods of time. If, however,
10 ml of squid-water (one 40-g squid and 400 ml seawater put in
a blender at high speed for 2 minutes, then strained) was added,
within minutes the animals came out of the sand, swam about for
a few minutes, and returned to their hiding place. In each
experiment the response time (e.g., the time interval between
