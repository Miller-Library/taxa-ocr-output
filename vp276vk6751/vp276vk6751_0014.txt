Figure 8. The total number of animals in the field population
found at a given 20-cm depth interval throughout the 12-hour
eriod.
Figure 9-a. The activity pattern of laboratory animals under
constant light conditions.

dark conditions.
gure 9-c. The aotivity patterns of laboratory animals under
light-dark cycle. The double line on the horizontal axis indicates
the period of darkness.
Figure 10. The affect of tidal rhythm upon activity level in
the absence and in the presence of the light-dark cycle. Verticle
dotted lines indicate duration of high and low water. Double
line on horizontal axis of light-dark graph indicate periods of
darkness.
Figure 11. The affect of tidal rhythm upon activity level in
constant light. Verticle dotted lines indicate periods of
high and low water.
