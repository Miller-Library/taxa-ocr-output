the introduction of the food stimulus and the appearance of the
first animal) was used as the criterion for level of activity:
a lower response time indicated a higher level of activity. In
some experiments 8 minutes was the time limit beyond which no
response was considered to occur. 10 minutes was the time limit
used in later experiments.
While many environmental factors interact to influence
the activity patterns of C. harfordi, laboratory experiments
were restricted to light, depth, and water turbulence.
Experiments to test the affects of light upon activity
patterns were conducted in three aquaria illuminated by three
General Electric F72712 cool-white fluorescent tubes placed 40
cm above the water surface. Each aquarium containing 20 animals
was placed under constant light, constant dark, and light-dark
conditions (lights off from 2000 to 0600 hours in the light-dark
cycle). Response time and water temperature were recorded every
two hours for 24 hours.
Experiments to test the affects of tidal rhythm upon
activity wore conducted in three aquaria, each containing 20
animals, and placed under the three light conditions described
above. In the constant light and the light-dark aquaria the water
level was lowered from the normal 25 cm depth to 3 cm above the
sand from 0400 to 1000 hours during a 48-hour period. In the
constant light aquarium the water level was lowered from 2100 to
