constant conditions. The activity level increased markedly
during the dark period of the light-dark cycle. Some antici-
pation of the change in light conditions was shown.
The results from the experiments testing the affect of
tidal rhythm upon activity level in the three light regimes are
shown in Figures 10 and 11. Response times shown are those obÂ¬
tained from one experiment. 8 minutes was the time limit within
which a response had to occur in Figure 10, and 10 minutes was
the time limit in Figure 11. In constant dark the activity level
was very much affected by tidal cycle; the level of activity was
lower during time of low water and increased when the level of
water was raised. In the light-dark cycle activity was cued on
the light only, tidal levels notwithstanding.
The results of the experiments testing the affect of water
water disturbance upon activity level in the three light regimes
re shown in Figures 12-a through 12-c. Response times shown
are those obtained from a single experiment. 10 minutes was the
time in which a response had to occur. Figures 12-a and 12-5
show no detectable pattern in activity level. Figure 12-c shows
the typical pattern of response time in the presence of the light-
dark cycle seen in Figures 9-c and Figure 10.
DISCUSSION
It is not surprising that C. harfordi did not appear to
cue its activity pattern to temperature. During cold, foggy
