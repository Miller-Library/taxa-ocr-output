10
days the water in the high intertidal probably does not fluctuate
any more than the ambient sea temperature and would not signal
to the animals that conditions are favorable for high levels of
activity.
The confirmation of the nocturnal habits of C. harfordi
is not unexpected. Birds are known to be heavy predators on
terrestrial isopods. Marine birds, which are likely to show
diurnal activity patterns, may have been an important predator
upon C. harfordi and through evolution have applied heavy selective
pressure for the isopods to adopt a nocturnal lifestyle. Day-
time would also provide heavy physiological stress upon an ani¬
mal venturing out at a low tide under a high noon sun.
The data strongly suggest that the animals have an opt-
imum depth of 20 to 40 cm which raises many interesting questions.
Do they remain in their homes until the water level directly
over their heads reaches 20 to 40 cm, or do they all come out
at sunset and merely follow the tidal cycle up and down main-
taining a position at 20 to 40 cm? It is impossible to tell from
the present data. What are the advantages in maintaining this
optimum depth? Perhaps under selection pressure from deeper
vater predatory fish a behavioral pattern has evolved keeping
isopods from venturing into deep water. At the same time ex¬
cursions into shallower water presents the possibility of being
caught in a high tide pool as the tide was ebbing away.
