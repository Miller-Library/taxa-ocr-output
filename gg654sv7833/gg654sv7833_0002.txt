antagonists inhibit development, and in particular cause a delay
in early cleavages (Buznikov et al, 1970; Renaud & Parisi,
1981).
Using the sea urchin species Paracentrotus lividus and
Sphaerechinus granularis, Renaud & Parisi reported reversal of
the cleavage inhibition, caused by the 5HT antagonists
metergoline and gramine, by the simultaneous addition of
serotonin to the incubating eggs. However, Denis LaRochelle in
David Epel's lab found that this was not possible with
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs.
Species differences can mean variable plasma membrane
permeability. Since serotonin is a charged molecule at
physiological pH, egg permeability could indeed be the reason for
the seemingly negative results. I therefore decided to use the
technique of electrically permeabilizing the eggs, adding a
substrate, and then resealing the plasma membrane pores with low
calcium sea water (method of Robert Swezey and David Epel, 1989).
I achieved moderate success reversing the effects of 5-HT
antagonists metergoline and ketanserin with serotonin. When high
amounts of serotonin were used, cells treated with serotonin
cleaved much earlier than controls.
Renaud and Parisi (1981) had reported that gramine's effect
on cleavage only included a delay in cytokinesis, not in
karyokinesis, or chromosal replication and separation. So, in
order to investigate the nature of serotonin involvement in
development, I used 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) to
fluorescently stain the chromosomes and observe karyokinesis in
