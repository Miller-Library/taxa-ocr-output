antagonist-treated eggs as compared to controls. I found that
metergoline, ketanserin, and methysergide all delayed
karyokinesis concurrent with the delay in cytokinesis.
Recently, a great deal of neurological research has resulted
in the characterization of three types of serotonin receptors:
5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 receptors. In addition, within the 5-HTI
class, there are four distinct subclasses: 5-HTIA, 5-HTIB, 5-
ITIC, and 5-HTID receptors. Each receptor type and subtype has
different affinities for different serotonergic drugs. They are
characterized by radioligand studies and by pharmacological
differences. Most 5-HT receptors bind the same drugs; the
difference is in the affinities for these drugs. I have included
as table 1, a characterization of 5-HTI and 5-HT2 receptors (from
S. Peroutka, 1988). Different receptor types have also been
correlated with different activities. For example, 5-HTIC and 5Â¬
T2 receptors have been proposed to affect phophotidylinositol
turnover, whereas 5-HTlA receptors have been correlated with
adenylate cyclase modulation. Although the putative
intracellular receptors in sea urchin eggs are unlikely to be the
same as any classified neural extracellular receptors, comparison
of different drug affinities for these receptors is nevertheless
a useful way of characterizing them. Therefore, I have done a
series of concentration experiments with the serotonergic drugs
metergoline, methysergide, spiperone, ketanserin, methiothepin,
cinanserin, DOI, RU24969, and 1-phenyl biguanide in order to
compare drug potencies and help characterize the hypothesized
receptors. Structures of all drugs used are in tables 2 and 3.
