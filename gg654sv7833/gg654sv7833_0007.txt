Other potent drugs were Methiothepin, Spiperone, Ketanserin and
Metergoline, all 5HT2 antagonists. Methysergide, a 5-HT2
antagonist, was somewhat less potent, but nevertheless
significantly delayed cleavage at a concentration of 30 uM.
Three selective agonists were used as well: RU24969, a 5-
HTIB agonist; DOI, a 5-HT2 agonist; and 1-phenyl biguanide, a
5-HT3 agonist. None of these agonists had the expected effect of
speeding up cleavage. On the contrary, as shown in figures 7-9,
they all acted as serotonin antagonists by delaying cleavage. As
shown in table 1 and figures 7-9, Phenyl biguanide was a very
weak antagonist, effective only at very high concentrations,
whereas DOI was the most potent and RU24969 showed a medium
effectiveness (effectiveness as measured by the concentration of
drug required to significantly delay cleavage).
Effects of Serotonin
As shown in figures 10-11, I was able to reverse cleavage delays
by metergoline and ketanserin with serotonin. The concentrations
of serotonin used are only approximate because, using the
electroporation technique, it is impossible to know for any given
experiment exactly how much substrate is entering into the cells.
For the metergoline experiment, I found that "100 uM
serotonin reversed the effects of 10 uM metergoline, but the 1mM
serotonin sample was not sped up over controls. In the
ketanserin experiment, however, I found that serotonin not only
reversed the 10 uM ketanserin delay, but also, as shown in
figures 11 and 12, embryos with concentrations of serotonin
