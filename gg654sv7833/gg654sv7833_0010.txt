been found to act on these receptors is serotonin itself. The
receptors appear to bind similar substrates, but not be activated
by them in the same way as its intended substrate, serotonin. As
shown in figure 12, serotonin not only reverses the effect of the
antagonists ketanserin and metergoline, but by itself, speeds up
development.
Further studies on serotonin's role in sea urchin egg
development could clarify many remaining questions. The use of
5-HTIA, 5-HTIC, and 5-HTID agonists would confirm whether or not
sea urchin egg receptors are comparable to known nerve cell
receptors. Radiolabeling, antibodies, or other methods could
help confirm the existence of the receptors, and possibly locate
them in the cell.
I did in fact attempt a standard radiolabeling experiment in
Steve Peroutka's lab at Stanford University, but found no
receptor activity. However, these results are not conclusive
since this test is designed for high density nervous tissue, such
as rat brain. In fact this test does not find activity in lower
density receptor tissue such as cardiac tissue, which has known,
characterized serotonin receptors (S. Peroutka, personal
communication). So, a different radioassay would have to be
designed to definitively find activity.
Finally, as noted in the introduction, serotonin receptors
in other systems are known to affect phosphatidylinositol
turnover, and adenylate cyclase activity. Therefore, studies
measuring the effect of serotonin on calcium and cAMP levels in
sea urchin embryos, or phosphotidylinositol turnover could help
