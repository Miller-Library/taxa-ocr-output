S.purpuratus eggs were prepared according to the above two
methods, depending on whether serotonin was used or not. Instead
of fixing eggs with formaldehyde, however, the DAPI staining
method was used to kill the eggs and stain the chromosomes for
viewing under a fluorescence microscope. At 70, 80, 90, and 100
minutes, 1 ml of egg suspension from each plate was washed twice
in KGE mix (3 mM potassium gluconate, 3.2 mM glycine, .4 mM EGTA,
and .4 mM magnesium sulfate). Eggs were then resuspended in 1 ml
of .18 Triton detergent in KGE mix. 1 ul of a 1 mg/ml solution
of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) was added to each ml of
prepared eggs. In addition, formaldehyde stops were taken at 90,
100, 110, and 120 minutes in order to see cytokinesis effects and
compare them to effects on mitosis by the drugs. DAPI samples
were then viewed under a fluorescence microscope. If the results
were not obvious, plates were scored by counting 100 samples in
each plate. When high amounts of serotonin antagonists were
used, the results were obvious simply by viewing.
Results:
Delay of Cleavage by Serotonergic drugs
Table 4 shows the effective concentrations of all drugs used.
Cinanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, was found to be the most powerful
drug in delaying cleavage. The graph of the delay in cleavage
caused by 10 uM concentration cinanserin looks like delays caused
by 100 uM concentrations of most other drugs (see figures 1-6).
