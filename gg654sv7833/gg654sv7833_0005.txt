Whenever serotonin was used, it was necessary to permeabilize the
unfertilized eggs to allow the 5-HT to enter the cells. For
these experiments, after dejellying and washing the eggs, they
were resuspended in zero calcium sea water and washed twice, then
washed twice in transpermeabilization media (Trans Mix). The
transpermeabilization media is intended to mimic the cytoplasm of
the egg so that when eggs are electroporated, they do not lose
too many nutrients to their surroundings, nor do they become
activated by calcium or lysed by high sodium concentrations.
This media consists of 225 mM potassium gluconate, 185 mM
mannitol, 300 mM glycine, .5 mg/ml glutathione, 5 mM magnesium
chloride, 4 mM ATP, 10 mM spermidine (to keep the membranes
intact), 20 mM sodium chloride and 2 mM sodium bicarbonate. The
eggs were then given 300 volts of electric current, with.6
microfarads capacitance, 1 pulse every 10 seconds, for a total of
5 pulses. The eggs were then transferred to Eppendorf tubes
containing either serotonin in.058 ascorbic acid, or .058
ascorbic acid only (for controls). After 2 minutes, an excess of
low calcium sea water (9:1 ratio of zero calcium sea water to
fresh sea water) was added to each vial, the low concentration of
calcium resealing the egg pores without activating the eggs. The
eggs were washed once with 9:1 mix, then twice with fresh sea
water for a final suspension of 28. The rest of the procedure is
identical to the first method.
