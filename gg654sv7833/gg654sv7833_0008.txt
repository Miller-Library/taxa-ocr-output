higher than 10 um divided significantly ahead of controls.
Delay of Mitosis
Usin the DAPI method, I examined the effects of metergoline,
methysergide, and ketanserin on progression through mitosis. All
antagonists were found to also delay karyokinesis to the same
degree that cytokinesis was delayed. If a low concentration of
drug was used, the same percentage type delay ensued in both
cytokinesis and in karyokinesis. When a high concentration of
drug was used, drug-treated eggs were 1008 delayed over controls
in both cytokinesis and karyokinesis. Please see Table 5 for
results of each experiment.
Discussion:
Although serotonin receptors have not yet been characterized in
sea urchin eggs or embryos, all my results point to the
conclusion that serotonin receptors do exist in these embryos.
Six selective serotonin antagonists all delayed cleavage of
activated eggs. In addition serotonin appears to be involved in
early cell division, both cytokinesis and karyokinesis.
Cytological studies showed that eggs treated with high amounts of
antagonist (100 uM ketanserin and 50 uM metergoline) accumulated
in prophase, whereas controls moved on to other phases of
mitosis.
The most interesting aspect of these experiments is the
