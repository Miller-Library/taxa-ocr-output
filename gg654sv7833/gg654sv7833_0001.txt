Abstract:
Six serotonin antagonists, cinanserin, methiothepin, spiperone,
metergoline, ketanserin, and methysergide, were all found to
delay the first two divisions of sea urchin embryos. Three
serotonergic agonists, DOI, RU24969, and phenyl biguanide were
also found to delay cleavage, although more weakly than the
antagonists. Cleavage delays caused by 10 uM metergoline and 10
uM ketanserin were reversed by serotonin. Serotonin alone was
found to speed up cell division over controls. Cytological
studies showed the serotonin antagonists metergoline, ketanserin
and methysergide delayed karyokinesis as well as cytokinesis.
Introduction:
Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a potent mammalian
neurotransmitter, was first reported in sea urchin embryos in the
late '60's (Buznikov et al, 1964, 1970). The method originally
used was a fluorescence assay (Buznikov et al., 1970; Toneby,
1977), and these findings were later confirmed with the more
specific techniques of HPLC and thin-layer chromatography (Renaud
& Parisi, 1981, Toneby, 1977). Two lines of evidence suggest
that 5-HT is a regulator of sea urchin embryo development.
First, fluctuations in 5-HT levels, coincide with early cell
divisions (Buznikov et al. 1964). Secondly, serotonin
