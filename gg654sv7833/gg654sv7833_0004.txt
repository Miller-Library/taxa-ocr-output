Methods and Materials:
Fresh S. purpuratus gametes were collected by injecting 1-2 mls
of .5 M KCl into gravid sea urchins. The eggs were kept stirring
Eggs were always
at 160C. Dry sperm was kept at 400.
mechanically dejellied by passage through Nitex mesh and washed
twice before use. Eggs were diluted or concentrated as necessary
to keep a constant suspension of 28 (as measured by Bauer-Schenk
centrifuge tubes). Eggs were then fertilized, and subsequently,
the appropriate drugs added. Eggs were incubated in 24-microwell
plates, .5 ml per well. Drugs that were able to freely diffuse
through the egg membrane were simply added to the samples, the
same amount of solvent being added to the control plate. Whether
drugs were freely diffusible through the membrane was judged by
trial and error, i.e. determining whether the drug had an effect
on cleavage when simply added to the incubation plate. The two
solvents used were distilled water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
If DMSO was used, the maximum amount added to the eggs was 2ul/ml
of egg suspension. The fertilized, treated eggs were incubated
at 1600. Samples of two-cell and four-cell stages were taken of
the developing embryos at 100, 110, 120, 155, and 165 minutes and
put into a 18 formaldehyde solution. 100 embryos were counted
for each time stop of each plate and numbers of cleaved cells
taken to be percentages.
