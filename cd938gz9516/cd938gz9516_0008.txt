The second antennae also act as a pivot point when an
animal alights on a stipe of kelp. As the animal swims the
second antennae are extended anteriorly. Upon contacting
a solid surface the antennae are spread apart and provide
a pivot point as the anterior part of the body swings toward
the surface. The first three peraeopods are used to grab
the substratum and establish a hold (fig. 8).
Removal of one antenna affects the behavior of the ani-
mal but not drastically. Interfaces are still detected.
In walking, the animal compensates by increasing the arc
through which the remaining antenna is swung (fig. 3B).
In swimming, animals with one antenna missing swim in a
curving course toward the side of the remaining antenna in
80% of the cases observed. The intact antenna and the stump
are groomed. In righting themselves the animals arched their
bodies and flipped over to the side lacking the antenna.
Removal of both antennae had more noticeable effects.
In swimming, the air-water interface was not perceived until
the cephalon of the isopod was almost entirely out of the
vater. There is less variation of swimming patterns in these
animals. They tended to swim in straight lines, exhibitihg
little maneuverability. Righting was difficult to achieve.
