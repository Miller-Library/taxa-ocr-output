terior shell the animal merely attaches to the kelp with
the last three pairs of legs and then pulls itself out of the
old exoskeleton, segment by segment, in a series of undulating,
worm-like movements. Removal of the anterior shell is quite
different. The animal does not attach its anterior legs and
then walk backward out of its shell using the last three
pairs of legs. Instead, it bends its body sharply ventrally
and then the last three peraeopods grasp the anterior exo-
skeleton and are used to pull it off. This may demonstrate
the animal's tendencies always to move forward in locomotion
and also the importance of the second through the fourth per-
aeopods in accomplishing any ambulatory locomotion. Surgical
removal of the last three peraeopods causes the animal great
difficulty in removing the anterior molt. One such animal
took 6 hours to remove the anterior shell, whereas normally
it only takes 15 minutes.
The Uropods
Each uropod consists of two recognizable segments, a
proximal protopodite and a distal endopodite. The uropods
form valves covering the ventral side of the branchial chamber.
They serve to protect the pleopods, which are very delicate
structures and, in addition, they direct water flow through
the pleotelson.
Proper regulation of water flow in the branchial chamber
increases the efficiency of the pleopods in respiration and
