swimming (fig. 14). Water currents are drawn into the chamber
when the pleopods are raised and water is forced out when
they are lowered. The uropods can regulate the aperture
through which the stream of water flows, thus controlling
the speed of locomotion by the Venturi principle.
The endopodite of the uropod is free to move separately
from the protopodite and thus is able to narrow or widen
the posterior aperture of the pleopod chamber. It is pos-
sible that the endopodites help steer the body in swimming
by acting as rudders. However, the right and left endopodites
have never been observed to move independently of each other
in a way suggesting steering control.
The animals with one uropod removed always swam on a course
curving toward the side with the remaining uropod. The water
stream is deflected off the uropod and toward the opposite
side, creating a force pushing the animal to the side with
the uropod remaining (fig. 15).
In animals lacking both uropods, the two rami of each
pleopod were more widely separated than usual, so the exopodites
extended laterally out of the normal chamber. This resulted
in less water being jetted out posteriorly, and the animals
without uropods swim more slowly.
