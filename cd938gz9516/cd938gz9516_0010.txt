chew on. If one of the first peraeopods is removed, the
second peraeopod on the same side takes over the job of groom-
ing the antennae, though this is done somewhat inefficiently,
often leaving the outer segments of the flagellum untouched.
Removing both first peraeopods is compensated by the second
peraeopod pair taking over the role of the first.
The second peraeopods are well endowed with setae and
are used in grooming the first peraeopods when the latter are
burdened with debris. In an animal missing one of the second
peraeopods, e.g. the left, the animal compensates by bringing
the left first peraeopod to the right second peraeopod to be
cleaned.
The second, third, and fourth peraeopods are grouped to-
ion. The

segments are bent at an angle towards the surface of the kelp.
The fifth, sixth, and seventh peraeopods, on the other hand,
are oriented posteriorly. The basis faces toward the rear
and the other segments are usually aligned with the basis
in a resting animal.
On a stipe of Macrocystis the fifth through the seventh
peraeopods are used mainly for gripping the stipe. Often
the fourth pair joins the other three pairs. This leaves
the first three peraeopods free to groom and carry out
feeding activity. This separation of function brings to mind
the more extreme case of the arcturid isopods.
