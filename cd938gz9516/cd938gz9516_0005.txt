UTILIZATION OF APPENDAGES
The First Antennae
The first antennae are difficult to study because of
their small size and rather rapid movements in the normal
animal. They are used in chemoreoption and contain aesthetascs
on the outer segment which are the sensory structures (Schultz,
1969). Aesthetascs face forward amd the two appendages are
moved alternately.
In those animals with only one first antenna removed,
no change in behavior was noted. Removing both first anten-
nae resulted in a decrease in locomotary activity; the animals
remained in a stationary position and were non reactive to
prodding by the experimenter.
The. Second Antennae
The second antennae have five peduncular segments and
a number of segments in the flagellum which increases in di-
rect proportion to the size of the animal (Menzies, 1948).
In adult animals 20-25 mm long the number of flagellar seg-
ments ranged from 14 to 16. In animals 9-15 mm long there
were 8-10 segments.
According to Schultz (1969) the second antennae are mainly
tactile sensory structures. My own observations affirm they
are primarily used for probing the environment. The segments
of the peduncle are bent easily; notches in the margins of
