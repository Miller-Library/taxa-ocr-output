INTRODUCTION
Idotea resecata is a marine isopod found in fairly quiet
bay waters along the California coast. Though much work has
been done on the appendages for the purpose of taxonomy
(e.g. Menzies, 1950), search of the literature reveals little
on the functions of the appendages in Idotea. The more ob-
vious functions such as the use of the peraeopods for loco¬
motion have been assigned to the appendages (Schultz, 1969).
but details of the activities have not been described in
Idotea with the exception of feeding activity (Green, 1957
and Cruz, 1963).
In the kelp beds adjacent to Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove, numerous individuals were found which were missing
and regenerating appendages. Regeneration of the appendages
in Idotea has been described by several investigators
(Boussat, 1958; Varèse, 1960; Glaizal, 1962). However, nothing
has been mentioned about compensatory behavior following
amputation of an appendage.
I decided to examine function of selected appendages
in intact animals and in animals with selected appendages
removed. Observations on regeneration were recorded as
opportunity arose during the study.
I. resecata is a very hardy animal, survives well in the
lab and is very suitable for studies on appendage utilization
