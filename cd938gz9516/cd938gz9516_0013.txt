of support in the peraeon segments by arching its body. In
w-alking there is increased pleopod action to give a forward
thrust. The animals have much difficulty in moving around
the edge of a kelp blade from the upper surface to the under-
side; the anterior appendages are clearly needed to establish
the initial hold.
Removal of the fourth or the fifth peraeopod results in
difficulty as far as turning around on a stipe is concerned.
These center peraeopods are used as pivot points in an intact
animal, and the animal must compensate for their absence by
moving the pivot point forward or backward to a less favorable
location on the body.
Removal of two of the last three pairs of legs impairs
gripping of the substratum, but the animal can still hold on
reasonably well with just the seventh pair. If the last
three pairs are removed the animal has difficulty in holding
onto a stipe or blade of kelp.
In swimming, the animal compensates for the loss of the
last three pairs of peraeopods by having the fourth peraeopods
assume the role of a water brake (fig. 13).
One peculiar use of the fifth, sixth, and seventh per-
aeopods is their role in the removal of the anterior molt.
When an isopod molts, the posterior half of the exoskeleton
is molted first; then after a period of approximately 24
hours the anterior molt is discarded. In removing the pos-
