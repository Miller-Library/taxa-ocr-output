REGENERATION
The sequence of events during regeneration of appendages
varies with the type of appendage, the level at which the
original appendage was lost, the extent of damage to the
tissues remaining within the stump and the stage of the an-
imalin the intermolt cycle. Since it was not possible to
monitor these factors in the time period of this study, only
a general descriptionof the process will be made. Regen-
eration was studied up to the third molt for the first antennae
and up to the second molt in the other appendages (see fig.
17-36). A typical sequence is given by a description of
the events in the regeneration of a peraeopod.
The ischium of the peraeopod is the amputation site.
Immediately after the operation bleeding occurs. This stops
shortly thereafter. A dark green scab is sometimes present.
Three to four days later an exoskeletal covering is formed
over the wound. The area beneath the wound site is white.
After the first molt a stump is formed. It is rounded
in appearance, unsegmented and colorless. The second molt
produces a peraeopod with the same number of segments as in
a normal limb. However, the segmentation is not complete,
the joints are not entirely movable and the setae are absent
(fig. 31). The regenerate résembles the juvenile peraeopod
described by Menzies (1948).
