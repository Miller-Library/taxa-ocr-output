The pleopods also may be associated with circulation.
There is a direct correlation between the rate that the
pleopods beat and the rate of heart beat. When the heart con-
tracts the pleopods are extended ventrally and when the heart
expands the pleopods are brought back into the branchial
chamber. This implies that the pleopods are either aiding
in pumping the blood are moving as a consequence of the exÂ¬
pansion and contraction of the heart.
When the pleopods stop beating, the heart stops momentarily.
The heart starts beating again at a constant rate if the
pleopods remain stationary. This rate is maintained until
the pleopods start beating again. Then the heart beat rate
speeds up or slows down to coincide with the pleopod beat rate.
The pleopods may recommence beating before the heart does.
This suggests that the two structures are not enervated by
the same nerve.
