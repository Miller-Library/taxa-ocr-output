The second antennae are fastidiously groomed by the first
peraeopods (fig. 6). Material on the antennae of I. resecata
living on Macrocystis consists of mucus from the kelp and
adhering debris. These appear to be acceptable food sub-
stances, and the second antennae thus play a role in feeding
by serving as collecting devices. Both antennae are regularly
cleaned and the material is brought to the mouth parts. Fur-
ther details are discussed in relation to the first peraeopods.
A specific aspect of behavior was seen in a laboratory
aquarium which indicates the second antennae may participate
actively in another way in bringing detritus to the mouth
parts. Much detritus, mainly Macrocystis debris, had accum-
ulated on the bottom of the tank. On several occasions when
an I. resecata came to rest on the bottom in the detritus,
the second antennae which wer√© initially extended were pulled
in toward the cephalon as in grooming. A mound of debris was
accumulated in one stroke, and the first peraeopods grabbed
portions of this and transported it to the mouth parts.
The second antennae serve as a pivot point for the body
in certain situations as in righting. An isopod lying on its
back arches its body until only the telson and the tips of
the second antennae remain in contact with the substratum.
The arched position attained is unstable and usually the
animal is able to flip over to one side and right itself
(fig. 7).
