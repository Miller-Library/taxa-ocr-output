SUMMARY
1. The marine isopod Idotea resecata is found in the fairly
quiet waters of Monterey Bay living on the brown kelp Macro-
cystis. The utilization of selected appendages of I. resecata
was studied.
The second antennae probe the environment and may be
used in feeding in conjunction with the first peraeopods.
They act as pivot points in righting and in alighting on kelr
while swimming.
The first peraeopods are used in grooming the s√©cond

antennae in a manner suggesting a feeding mechanism. They are
associated with the mouth parts and are used for locomotion
only in compensation behavior.
4. The second, third, and fourth peraeopods are oriented
forward. Along with the fifth pair, they are the main ambu-
latory legs.
The first three peraeopods are used for grabbing kelp

when the animal is swimming.
6. The last three peraeopods are used for gripping the
substrate and are used as water brakes in swimming behavior.
They are also used for removing the anterior molt.
The uropods direct water flow through the pleotelson.
The pleopods show functional differentiation. The first
two pleopods possess hairs and are natatory. The fourth and
fifth pleopods are probably used mainly for respiration.
9. The correlation between the rate that the pleopods beat
and the rate of heart beat suggests that the pleopods play
a role in circulation.
10. Observations on regeneration were done.
