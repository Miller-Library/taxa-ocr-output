The Pleopods
The pleopods are the five pairs of appendages of the
anterior pleonal segments. They are biramous, each pleopod
having a free endopodite and exopodite coming off the basis.
The second pleopod in the male is sexually modified, having
a style. This modification is common to all members of
Valvifera (Schultz, 1969). In addition, the first and second
pleopods and the exopodite of the third pleopod have hairs
around the periphery. This is the case in Sphaeromatids,
also (Schultz, 1969). Size of the pleopod increases going
from the first to the fifth pair and the length of the hairs
decreases in going from the first to the third pair.
The presence of the hairs suggests that the first and
second pleopods are natatory. The hairs themselves are na-
tatory in structure. In an individual hair, there is one
main root with small bristles branching off from it (fig. 16).
The fourth and fifth pleopods lack hairs and have very thin
membranes, suggesting that they play more of a role in respir-
ation than locomotion.
Animals lacking the first and second pleopods are not
able to swim. The remaining pleopods beat but no motion is
generated. Animals missing the fourth and fifth pleopods are
able to swim but the incidence of death is high (50%). Thus
it seems that there are specialized functional modifications
in the pleopods of I. resecata.
