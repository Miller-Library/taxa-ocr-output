MATERIALS AND METHOD
Animals to be used for laboratory studies were collected
on Macrocystis and maintained on plants held in running sea
water aquaria at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford Uni-
versity.
Studies of swimming and of activity on kelp were made
in large aquaria. Ventrally placed structures were viewed
from below in a glass tube of 1.5 cm in diameter and 1 m
in length. Activity of animals on kelp blades was studied
under a dissecting microscope as well as in large tanks.
Removal of the appendages was accomplished by methods
described by Schneiderman (1967), using fine forceps and very
sharp manicuring scissors. Animals were first lightly anes-
thetized using a solution of MgCl, isotonic with sea water.
Their bodies were wrapped in damp cheesecloth to limit
movement, leaving only the area to be operated on exposed.
All operations were performed under a dissecting microscope.
For most appendages studied other than peraeopods (e.g.,
the first antennae, the second antennae, etc.) the appendage
was removed unilaterally in some specimens, bilaterally in
others. Three animals were operated on for each condition.
For peraeopod groups two and three, either one, two, or all
three pairs of appendages were removed. Here, too, operations
were performed on three animals for each condition.
