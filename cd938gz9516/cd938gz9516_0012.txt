are extended laterally. Similarly in slow swimming the last
three pairs of peraeopods are extended laterally perpendicular
to the body where they act as water brakes, disrupting the
flow of water about the body (fig. 11).
The braking phenomenon is also observed when an isopod
falls freely through the water. This was seen in isopods placed
in the glass observation tube and also in aquaria. The animals
are not long term swimmers and after a few swimming excursions
they appear to tire. When a tired animal is placed in the water
it falls, making no effort to swim, but the fall is retarded,
and balance is maintained, by the lateral perpendicular exten-
sion of all the peraeopods except for the first pair (fig. 12).
Once the animal has rested, swimming my be resumed again.
The first, second, and third peraeopods are used in a
swimming animal to grab an algal stipe when the animal initially
contacts it. As soon as the hold is established, resulting
in a stable position with the last four peraeopods firmly
gripping the stipe, the first peraeopods are pulled up to
assume the role of aiding the mouth parts once more.
Removal of the first peraeopods does not affect ambulatory
motion. When the second peraeopods are removed, the animal
compensates by using the first peraeopods as locomotary ap-
pendages. The first peraeopods become much more important
for locomotion if peraeopods two and three, or two to four
inclusive, are removed. The animal also compensates for lack
