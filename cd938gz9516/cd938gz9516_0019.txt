Removing a limb may have an effect on the molting cycle
of the animal. It was observed that in large animals 25-30
mm long the period between the first and second molts was
much shorter than the period between the operation and the
first molt. This suggests that amputation alters the molting
rhythm.
Regeneration was abnormal in the uropods and the pleopods.
Both were structurally distorted relative to normal appendages.
The uropod had setae on the posterior part of the protopodite
and were thickened (fig. 36). This thickening has also been
reported in Idotea baltica by Glaizal (1962). The regenerated
pleopods differed from the normal paddle shape in having a
very irregular surface (fig. 33).
