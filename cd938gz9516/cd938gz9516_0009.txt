The Peraeopods
Each peraeopod is composed of six segments. All per-
aeopods are subchelate and biunguilate. Except for the first
peraeopods, they are mainly locomotary and clinging appendages
and the biunguilate condition is a modification for walking.
The first peraeopods are used more like hands, and are closely
associated with the mouth parts.
The number of setae decreases as one goes from the first
to the seventh peraeopods. The first peraeopod has three
main clusters of setae, each centered around a large file
seta. The second, third, and fourth peraeopods each have two
clusters of setae and the last three pairs of legs have only
one main cluster.
As mentioned previously; the first peraeopods are used
in grooming the second antennae (fig. 6). The animal places
one of its antennae betw√©en the dactylus and the propodus
of the two first peraeopods and then pulls the antenna through
from base to tip. The three large file setae and their clusters
may be acting as food strainers. Mucus and debris are scraped
off and brought to the mouth parts where the material is mas-
ticated. This behavior may be regular, with the animal repeatedly
cleaning off first one antenna and then the other. If the
food is rejected by the animal the material is removed from
the mouth parts by the first peraeopods. The first peraeopods
also actually hold chunks of food for the mouth parts to
