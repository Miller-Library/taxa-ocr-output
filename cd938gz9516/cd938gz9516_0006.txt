segments allow for increased movement between adjoining seg-
ments (fig. 17). The flagellum, being composed of many seg-
ments, has great flexibility which enables the antennae to
explore the environment very efficiently. Physical inter-
faces, e.g. the air-water interface, are detected by the
second antennae. When the interface is contacted, the animal
alters its behavior, i.e. in the case of a swimming isopod,
the animal changes direction (fig. 1).
When the animal is stationary on a kelp leaf, the anten-
nae are held in a forward position but angled approximately
40Â° from the anterior-posterior axis. At rest on the stipe
of Macrocystis the second antennae straddle the tubular stipe
for balance or for gripping the stalk (fig. 2).
When the animal is walking on kelp, the antennae swing
about irregularly in an arc (fig. 34). There is no set pattern
relating the behavior of the antennae to one another in the
probing, but they never contact each other. An animal about
to go around the edge of a kelp blade from the upper to lower
surface, first bends the antennae to probe the under surface
(fig. 4); following this it may move. In swimming, the anten-
nae are extended straight forward, allowing for smoother
fluid flow about the body. Sometimes the extreme outer
segments of the flagellum are pointed outward. The animal
may be sonsing the presence of a solid surface and is poised
for contact (fig. 5).
