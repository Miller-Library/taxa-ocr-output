The second through the fifth peraeopods are the major
ambulatory legs. Locomotion is ditaxic with the body remaining
fairly rigid (fig. 9). The unguis is used to establish
anchorage in ambulatory movement. If the unguii are removed
from all of the peraeopods the animal cannot carry out nor-
mal walking, and only inefficient slow gliding movement re-
sults. While the animal is walking, the first peraeopods are
extended in quick, alternating movements in front of the body,
acting like probes. The sixth and seventh peraeopods are
normally inactive in slow walking. Their activity increases
with the speed of movement. Monotaxic movement is sometimes
exhibited by the appendages, with the frequency of this in-
creasing as one goes from the seventh to second peraeopods.
The first legs have never been observed moving monotaxically.
In backward motion the sixth and seventh peraeopods play
more of a role, moving ditaxically; their posterior orientation

these two pairs of legs extensively in turning around.
In fast swimming the peraeopods are all pulled in close
to the body giving a streamlining effect (fig. 10). The first
three pairs are oriented forward, dactylus out, poised for
grasping. The fourth through the seventh legs are oriented
posteriorly with the fourth pair bent at the basal-ischium
joint and the last three pairs aligned straight back. To
