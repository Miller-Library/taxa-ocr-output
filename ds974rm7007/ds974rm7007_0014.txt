The drop in swimming activity from day 12 to day 13 is difficult to explain. It is possible
that the fish used in the day 13 experiment were not healthy. Ã„fter the experiment, they
were examined and found not to have undergone metamorphosis. Possibly fish which
have not metamorphosed by day 13 begin to decline. However, they were no other signs
of decline in these fish.
The flexion experiments lent little insight into the changing swimming technique of
these fish. The fish swim with increasing stiffness as they age, but their bodies do not
loose any flexibility. One alternative explanation to changing flexibility is acquisition of
the capability to use the muscles to modulate body stiffness. It has been shown that the
largemouth bass can increase body stiffness by using their muscles to generate negative
mechanical work (Long and Nipper, 1996). Perhaps as the Bonito gain sophistication of
muscle firing pattern they are able to stiffen as they swim.
The first aspect of anatomy of motoneurons, the existence of pattern A and pattern
B cells, remains developmentally and functionally enigmatic. One suggestion based on the
data is that cells are born in pattern B and grow into pattern A. This contention requires
further investigation to be convincing. Though pattern A cells are larger than those of
pattern B, there is scant evidence that pattern A cells arise first. When we examined the
development of the tier structure across culture time, it appeared that cells are born in
groups, which we saw as tiers, and then migrate dorsally and medially to join the other
cells. If this is the case, the first tier of cells is born pre-hatch and migrates to the dorsal
third of the spinal cord by day 2. Embryonic studies are necessary to examine the pattern
of the first tier of cells at their birth. The second tier may then appear at day four and still
be apparent at day five, when we observed it first. Further staining and visualization of
