Fig. 1 Behavior experimental apparatus.
Fig. 2 Injection site in ventral muscle. Rostral is down; ventral is left.
Fig. 3 Change in fish flexibility over culture time. Smaller angle of flexion equals greater
flexibility.
Fig. 4 Change in activity levels of fish over culture time. All data shown, means are
outlined squares, error bars are standard deviations.
Fig. 5 Change in activity levels of fish over culture time. All data shown, means and
standard deviations calculated with all data points greater than one standard
deviation outside the mean removed.
