powered by a motor. The motor was modulated by a 1 kQ potentiometer to allow for
variable rotational velocity and by a three way switch to facilitate both directions of
rotation. To approximate conditions in Jones (1963), each vertical black and white pair of
stripes covered 18 degrees of the drum's inside area; each black stripe was 1.9 in width
and each white stripe was 2.6 cm in width. The fish were filmed at 1:1.6 magnification by
a Sony CCD camera suspended 30.3 cm above the petri dish, and the footage recorded by
a Panasonic Time Lapse VCR 6740. To facilitate the experimenter's visibility of the fish,
the base of the petri dish was painted black for 2-12 day old fish which are largely
unpigmented, and white for 13 day old fish which are dark in color. Each day, five fish
were placed in the apparatus at approximately lOam and the drum cycled through its
rotating capabilitiesâ€”clockwise and counterclockwise at each possible speed.
To gain insight into the mechanics of Bonito swimming, we quantified percent time
active versus time at rest and maximum angle of body flexion across all 12 days of culture
time. First, we inspected the video tapes and were unable to find any quantifiable
response to the rotating drum, even at very high speeds- the fish did not turn or swim a
different amount under the varying conditions. However, the fish were sufficiently active
when the drum was not spinning to use this time segment of each tape for scoring.
Activity was quantified with a stopwatch. Each two minute sample, one sample
per day, began after the first minute in the rotating drum apparatus to allow for
attenuation. Because the purpose of this study is to analyze swimming behavior, a fish
was considered active if any part of its trunk or tail was visibly moving. Thus, a fish
holding still but snapping its jaw was considered inactive, while a fish hovering in place
with its tail beating was scored as active (we chose to include hovering in swimming
