behavior). Initially, both active time and inactive time were scored and summed to
determine accuracy of scoring. As I improved my timing technique, and the sums became
consistently accurate, this precaution was abandoned. All five fish were surveyed and the
mean percent time active calculated.
Maximum body flexion was scored similarly, using two minute segments and data
from all five fish. When a large body flexion was observed, the behavior was traced ster
by step onto acetate paper from a frame by frame playback on the Panasonic Time Lapse
VCR. The flexion of the fish's body was measured by drawing lines through the axis of
the head and tail and finding the angle with a protractor-the smaller the angle, the greater
the flexion. The smallest angle for each fish was chosen and the mean of these maximum
flexions calculated for each day.
Anatomy of Motoneurons
We labeled spinal motoneurons by injecting ventral muscle with the retrograde neuronal
tracer Dil (Molecular Probes*) at 2.5 mg/mL. Dil is a long-chain dialkylcarbocyanine
which diffuses laterally in the plasma cell membranes of axons in muscle tissue to fill the
cell bodies in the spinal cord.
Fish from days 2 through 13 were anesthetized by placing in a beaker on ice and
then fixed for two hours in 3.7% formaldehyde. The fixed fish were then injected on a
microscope stage using injection micropipettes directed by a Narishige micromanipulator.
The micropipettes were pulled from 1.5mm diameter, 4 inch long capillary tubes on a
Narishige vertical puller. Dil was drawn into the tips of the microelectrodes by capillary
action. A sample injection is shown in Fig 2 (rostral: down, ventral: left), though
