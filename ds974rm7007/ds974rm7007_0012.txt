Small voltage changes appear to sum into a small mound immediately prior to both double
spikes, which are 667 Hz and 286 Hz respectively. This simple activity demonstrates the
ability of a day 3 fish to fire high frequency potentials which are followed by movement
without observable delay.
A recording from a day 5 fish (Fig. 19) includes a 95 msec action potential series
of lower frequency (80 Hz) than the record from day 3 (Fig. 17). This series is more likely
but not definitively from muscle. The interpeak interval of spikes in this record is again
approximately constant. Series of similar and lower frequencies were consistently found in
day 5 and older fish.
Two successful records from the final day of recording, day 7, show significantly
different electrical patterns, both of which appear to be muscle activity. Fig. 20 shows a
long (627 msec) duration swim burst of spike clusters with maximal amplitude of about 4
uV and a relatively low 17 Hz frequency. Fig. 21 shows a non-periodic record with peaks
of two recurring amplitudes (about 8 uV and about 3.5 uV). Unlike previous events, this
pattern shows a variable interpeak interval, which is interpreted as a more sophisticated
pattern.
Discussion
We believe we have made progress towards our overall goal of correlating the behavior,
motoneural anatomy, and electrophysiology of Bonitoâ€™s pre-metamorphosis development
Our general conclusions are as follows. First, the fish become increasingly active over the
period studied, and enhance their repertoire of swimming behaviors. Second, the anatomy
