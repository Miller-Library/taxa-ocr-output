easily between the two. Fish of all ages sampled can execute a C-type fast start as
described in literature, but do not appear to use the behavior as an escape response or a
predatory attack response (Williams et al, 1996). Three swimming strategies are seen
over the course of development. In days 2-3, the fish swim by undulating their entire
bodies. In days 4-6, they begin to swim using tips of their tails. Finally, in days 7-13, the
fish are capable of tail tip locomotion, as before, and full tail locomotion. In Days 7
through 9, the fish spend much of their time either hovering-beating their tails without
propelling forward-or swimming continuously around the dish. Fish are seen to attack
each other beginning at day 8.
As is illustrated in Fig. 3, no trend was found in the maximum body flexion for the
time period sampled (f-value = 18.4, r=26). The means of percent time that fish of each
age were active are higher in days 5-13 than in days 2-4 (Fig. 4). Figure 5 is an alternative
plot of this data, in which all data points outside one standard deviation of the original
mean are eliminated. In figure 5, the highest mean is at day 8 and the lowest is at day 2,
and there is a drop from day 12 to day 13. There is a decrease in activity from days 8-10
and an increase from days 10 -12.
Anatomy of Motoneurons
We found two patterns of motoneurons in segments of the spinal cord. Cells in
pattern A (Fig. 6), which is more common, tend to have larger cell bodies which extend
their axons straight down to a long fiber tract parallel to the spinal cord. This fiber tract
veers ventrally to form the root. It appears that these cells extend their axons to the
ventral root just caudal to the cell. Cells in pattern B (Fig. 7) are smaller and less densely
crowded into a segment than cells in pattern A. Their axons extend directly to the ventral
