root and tend to intersect each other. In general, segments exhibit exclusively pattern A
or patter B, but in some segments of a Day 7 fish, a set of pattern B cells was observed
ventral to two sets of pattern A cells.
The number of cell bodies per segment is highest in pattern A structures in the last
two days, at greater than 25 cells per segment. A general increasing trend in number of
cells per segment was apparent. Many cells, even at day 2, have extensive dendritic
arbors, which increase in number of dendrites and extent of arborization with age (data not
shown). Fish older than day 8 also have many swellings in the ventral roots. In fish from
days five through 7, cells in a segment are divided into tiers which are distinguishable by
margins which separate them and, in the case of day 7 fish, by the morphology of the cells
in each tier. Cells in the more ventral tiers are usually smaller than the cells above them.
Two day 2 Bonito were successfully injected and visualized. The stained portions
of both fish extend rostrally from the midsection of the fish. Fig. 8 shows the most rostral
neurons stained. Only four patter A cells are visible, which is possibly due to poor
staining. More neurons are seen in the most caudal segment stained (Fig. 6). This
segment contains more than 15 cells, in pattern A. In both segments, the cells extend their
axons caudally into the ventral root behind them.
A more complete picture of early larval spinal cord anatomy is shown in Fig. 9, a
reconstruction of a day 3 Bonito spinal cord. This spinal cord has five sections which
represent different morphologies. In the most caudal section, between the tail tip and first
arrow, each segment contains approximately three cell bodies which are stacked in
pyramid form (20X, Fig. 10). The next section, between arrows 1 and 2, is either quite
simple compared to the previous segment or not well stained, but it does shown one
