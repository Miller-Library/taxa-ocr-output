Materials and Methods
Fish
Bonito were cultured at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and collected live each day of
experimentation. In our numbering system, eggs are collected from a tank of adult bonito
and set in the culture tank on day 0. The eggs usually hatch on day 2. With the exception
of electromyographic (EMG) recordings, the experiments included 12 days of the larval
Bonito's maturation period- days 2 through 13. EMG experiments comprised recordings
from days 2 through 7. All fish used in electrophysiology studies were raised at 22°C. In
the course of the experiments, we sampled fish from three broods, raised under the same
conditions with the exception of temperature. Day 2, 3, 5, and 6 fish used for
motoneuronal staining were cultured at 26.5°C +.5°C. All other fish were cultured at
22.5°C+5°C
Behavior
In order to study swimming behavior, we constructed an apparatus to elicit
propulsion and direction changes, modeled after Jones (1963), in which a similar apparatus
is used to measure the responses of fish to moving backgrounds. In the general setup, fish
swim freely in a container inside a rotating black and white striped cylindrical drum,
intended to simulate a water current acting on the fish. Many species of fish have been
shown to swim with the rotating stripes, against the artificial current (Jones, 1963). In our
apparatus, illustrated in Fig. 1, the larval Bonito swam in a raised petri dish of diameter
8.8 cm with an opaque bottom. The petri dish was placed in a cut opening in the bottom
of a plastic bucket which had been modified for the experiment. The 28.6 cm diameter (at
base), 30.3 cm high bucket was positioned open end up on a revolving tray which was
