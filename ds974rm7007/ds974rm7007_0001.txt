Abstract
Developmental changes in the swimming behavior and the underlying muscular function
and motoneural anatomy in the Pacific Bonito, Sarda chiliensis, were investigated in the
course of the first twelve days of post-hatch development of the fish. Quantitative
observations of behavior revealed peaks in activity at days 8 and 12 of development
Analysis of maximum body angle while turning showed no trend towards decreasing or
increasing flexibility of the fish (f-value = 18.4, râ€™ =.26), even though Bonito use different
amounts of flexion while swimming in different stages of development. Motoneurons in
the spinal cord from days 2 through 7 are organized into tiers: one tier was seen on days 2
and 3, two tiers on days 5 and 6, and three tiers on day 7. Tier distinction decreases as the
fish grow older, and tiers are no longer distinguishable on day 11. Spinal cord cells are
also divided into two categories-cells in pattern A tend to be larger and extend their
axons ventrally to a fiber tract which travels parallel to the spinal cord and then veers to
form the ventral root, while pattern B cells are smaller and extend their axons directly to
their ventral root. Finally, neuritic connections between cells were seen in early days and
multiplied with age. In later fish, extensive swellings were seen in the ventral roots and
neurites of the spinal cord. Electrophysiology studies revealed that on day 7, the motor
units of the fish began to fire in sustained low frequency series' reminiscent of the tail beat
in continuous swimming. Also on day 7, a variable pattern of firing was observed for the
first time. These data correlate acquisition of swimming behavior with increased
complexity of motoneurons and greater sophistication of muscle activity. Understanding
Bonito's striking development is a step towards developing a well-characterized model
system for the study of the acquisition of swimming in teleosts.
