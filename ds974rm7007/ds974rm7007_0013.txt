of motoneurons increases in complexity. And third, the muscle activity becomes more
sophisticated
A source of error exists in the husbandry of the fish used in behavioral and
neuroanatomical experiments. Fish from days 2 -7 were cultured at 26.5째C while fish
from days 8 -13 were taken from a different brood cultured at 22.5째C, the preferred
culture temperature. It has been suggested that the growth cycle is accelerated when the
temperature is increased (MacFarlane, pers. comm.). Since in our experiments the earlier
fish might have had accelerated growth, the results would underestimate the differences
between younger and older fish. The greatest complication is in correlating EMG data
with other data; fish used in EMG's were raised at 22째C, while most of their counterparts
(days 2-6) in other experiments were raised at 26째C.
The general increase in activity over culture time is likely to result from all or part
of the following explanation. Natural selection may prefer fish that swim more at early
ages because the exercise strengthens the pattern generator which controls swimming as
well as the muscles which execute it. However, the younger fish may lack the ability to
coordinate their muscles into sustained swimming activity. This second statement is
supported by the lack of observation of any fish before day 5 swimming continuously, the
simplicity of motoneural anatomy until day 5, and day 3 EMGs, which show no record of
low frequency sustained muscle group firing.
The peak in swimming activity at day 8 corresponds to the hovering behavior,
which is seen constantly at this age. Older fish return to floating when they are resting,
while day 8 fish hover while resting. Therefore, although fish from days 9 through 12
swim more continuously than day 8 fish, the fish have highest overall activity on day 8.
