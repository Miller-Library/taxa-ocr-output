Spinal motoneurons in vertebrates are multipolar, and the number of dendrites
corresponds to the amount of synaptic input the cell receives (Kandel et al, 27). Large
dendritic arbors and many synaptic connections within the spinal cord and between ventral
roots and muscle are affiliated with finer motor control and more complex behaviors. The
enhanced dendritic arborization and complex topology of ventral roots seen as the fish
ages is likely responsible for the increase in coordinated behaviors such as hovering. The
putative neuromuscular junction seen in the day 10 fish (Fig. 14) may be a direct example
of increased motor control.
A single electrode inserted into muscle tissue detects signal from asynchronous
motor units in the vicinity. The signals tend to interfere with each other, constructively or
destructively, so the resulting EMG is often replete with random and complicated signals
(Loeb and Gans, 50). For this reason, we examined extracellular EMGs not for precise
analysis of swimming mechanism but for comparison across ages of larval fish. The most
important information gleaned from EMGs comes from the two day 7 recordings. For the
first time in day 7, we saw sustained low frequency firing which almost certainly comes
from motor units. The 17 Hz frequency of the series in Fig. 20 corresponds to the
frequency of tail beat of a day 7 fish swimming continuously around the dish. The clusters
of spikes in this EMG suggest that motor units have been able to synchronize. Further,
we see in Fig. 21 that a day 7 fish can create a variable pattern of firing. This
sophisticated pattern suggests complex behavior, such as coordinating fins to execute
hovering. It is interesting to note that the fish acquire sustained low frequency firing,
sophisticated pattern firing, a third tier of motoneurons, and the ability to hover on day 7.
