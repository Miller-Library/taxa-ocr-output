Introduction
Developmental studies in fishes are focused mainly on swimming-one of the
simpler forms of vertebrate locomotion. In swimming, muscle movements are reduced to
lateral sets of myotomes which contract alternatively to propel the fish forward. These
myotomes overlay the spinal cord and demarcate its segments. This simple organization
facillitates ease of both neural control in the fish and muscular and neural studies (Sillar et
al, 1993). Correlational studies of the development of swimming behavior, muscle
activation, and motoneural anatomy have been performed in several swimming organisms,
including cyclostomes and amphibians, but not extensively in teleost fishes. Larval
zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) motoneural anatomy has been studied extensively, and
swimming acquisition and underlying neural patterns have been analyzed in larval
Angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare), but developmental biology still lacks a wellÂ¬
characterized model teleost species for neural control and muscle activation during
swimming (Yoshida et al, 1996)
This paper introduces another candidate teleost model, the Pacific Bonito (Sarda
chiliensis). Bonito offer an auspicious and interesting model for the study of teleosts for
three reasons. First, it is possible to detach the intact spinal cord from the fish with
minimal effort, allowing for neuroanatomical and physiological studies. Second, these fish
are highly active from a very early age and exhibit a range of behaviors including turning,
burst swimming, listing, and, later in development, hovering, continuous swimming, and
predation. Bonito development is accelerated compared to that of other teleosts. For
example, larval Angelfish, Pterophyllum scalare, do not show locomotion until S days
after hatching (Yoshida et al, 1996), while Bonito can swim immediately post-hatch.
