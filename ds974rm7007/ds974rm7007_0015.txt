day four fish is necessary to show the birth of the second tier if it does occur at that point.
If this ontogeny is correct, the cells which appear ventrally and laterally on day 7 are
nascent cells-the only nascent cells that we saw, which happened to be in pattern B.
However, we did see larger cells in pattern B in days 10 and 13, when no tier structure
was apparent. Therefore, a developmental trend in appearance of patterns A and B has
not yet been conclusively observed.
The functions of cells in these patterns may be partially related to external
structure. The most striking difference between the two patterns was that in pattern A,
cells project their axons to a fiber tract running parallel to the spinal cord which then veers
ventrally to form the root. A study of this fiber tract-its structure, and any synaptic
connections in it, could lend insight into how the input of cells of type A is modulated on
its path to the muscle. Any function of these fiber tracts with regard to electrical activity
could create a difference in type A and type B electrical outputs.
The succession of tiers in the spinal cord correlates with the acquisition of
swimming behavior. We observed one tier of cells on days 2 and 3, two tiers on days 5
and 6, and a third tier on day 7. Beginning day 8, the distinction between tiers of cells
disappears and by day 11 is completely nonexistent. It is interesting to note first that
activity reaches a maximum at day eight, after all tiers are present. Further, the more
complex behaviors which we seek to understandâ€”hovering, continuous swimming, and
predation-are each established by day 8. The fish increase their activity level and
repertoire of swimming behaviors as the number of tiers increase, and reach full capability
when all tiers are present.
