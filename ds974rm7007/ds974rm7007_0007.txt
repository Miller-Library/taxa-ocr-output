electrode tips were usually drawn out of the fish without breaking. The injected fish were
stored in either distilled water, formaldehyde solution, or Phosphate Buffered Saline
(PBS) overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. They were then visualized at 4, 10, 20, and 40X on
an Olympus fluorescence microscope and videotaped to a Sony VCR SLV-373UC.
Images were captured from the footage using the Megavision 1024XM System v.4.3. and
processed on Adobe Photoshop. Motoneuronal anatomy was analyzed qualitatively
directly from the footage and from captured, processed images.
Electrophysiology
Extracellular recordings were read from a single tungsten wire inside a capillary tube
pulled on the Narishige vertical puller to make an electrode. The fish was stabilized in
10% Agarose and supplied with water in a dish. The electrode was positioned in the fish's
muscle using a Narishige micromanipulator. During readings, careful attempts were made
to observe any movement which might be matched with action potentials. The stage was
lighted with a D.C. battery, rather than with the AC light source, to avoid creating excess
noise in the signal. The experimenter noted any apparent artifacts due to movement near
the specimen. The signal was recorded on a Sony DAT 670 and selected time periods
processed with PAT—Single Channel Current Analysis Program v6 6d. EMG's were then
converted to Microsoft Excel and further processed.

Behavior
Qualitative observations were made of Bonito behavior. All observations were made at
22°C. Starting at day 2, Bonito can swim either upright or on their sides, and alternate
