repeating well stained dorsal cell body. Sections 3 and 5 show complicated segments of
pattern A cells, while section 4 is either simple or unstained. A 20X image of more
complex cell morphology, taken from the most rostral segment of the fish's body, is
shown in Fig. 11. It appears that the cells shown in Fig. 11 extend their axons to ventral
roots both caudal and rostral to themselves, however this is difficult to discern. The
ventral roots are more likely close enough together that cell bodies from one appear to
extend processes to the rostrally adjacent ventral root.
A partial reconstruction of the day 5 spinal cord is compared with the day 3 spinal
cord and a partial day 7 spinal cord in Fig. 12. Only the rostral portions of the day 5 and 7
fish were successfully stained. Days 3 and 7 show increasing complexity and number of
cells moving from caudal to rostral, but this trend is not clear in the day 5 reconstruction.
Day 5 segments appear to have two loosely defined tiers of cells, both of which are
arranged in pattern A.
The day 7 spinal cord contained the first visible third tier of cell bodies, in the
fourth through eleventh segments. Fig. 13 shows one segment of spinal cord in two
different planes of focus-one showing the more dorsal, medial upper tiers, in pattern A,
and the other showing the ventral, lateral, third tier in pattern B. A third tier has
approximately 8 cells; an entire segment has more than 20 cells. Video footage suggested
a two tier structure in the most rostral day 7 ventral roots, the more ventral tier containing
smaller cell bodies.
In day 10, there is extensive connectivity-fine processes are visible and swellings
on the fibers in the ventral roots are abundant. The processes projecting from the ventral
root in Fig. 14 appear to be innervating muscle. The most ventral of these processes
