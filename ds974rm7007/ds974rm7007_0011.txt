appears to end in a neuromuscular junction. The clearest example of pattern B, shown
above, was from a day 10 fish (Fig. 7). In fact, all neurons seen in this day 10 fish were in
pattern B.
Images from day 11 and day 13 fish show a marked increase in cell number per
segmentâ€”each segment shown in Fig. 15 has at least 30 cell bodies. These are pattern A
cells, and they have lost all organization which would suggest tiers. The best defined
image from day 13 shows a more complex morphological structure than any seen in earlier
fish (Fig. 16), which under better resolution is interpreted as a pattern B cluster caudal to
a pattern A cluster. The pattern A ventral root connects with more than 25 cells; the
pattern B ventral root has fewer.
Electrophysiology
EMGs were recorded from days 2, 3, 5, and 7.
A record from a day 3 fish is shown in Fig. 17. The wholescale shift in voltage
(232-396 msec) is preceded by 100 msec by a small spike of amplitude 1.8 uV. Record
portions such as this were correlated with movement of the fish. The next section of the
record is a series of short duration spikes. The high amplitude peaks in this series (greater
than 1.1 microV; average 1.75 microV) have a firing frequency of 117 Hz and a constant
interpeak interval. These spikes are at such a high frequency that they cannot be
correlated with action potentials in muscle, and may in fact be neurons firing.
Fig. 18 shows a record from a different day 3 fish, with two consecutive events
consisting of two spikes followed by movement, with a 28 msec delay between events.
