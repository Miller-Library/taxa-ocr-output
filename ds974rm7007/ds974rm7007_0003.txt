Finally, healthy Bonito undergo a rapid metamorphosis at the end of the larval stage after
which they immediately act as predators. We feel that this metamorphosis, in which a
Bonito triples in size in approximately 48 hours, must be preceded by substantial progress
in motoneural organization and muscle coordination so that the fish are advanced
swimmers upon reaching full size. As of yet, there are no theories or data regarding how
they might accomplish this preparation.
We seek to quantify Bonito's accelerated behavioral development prior to
metamorphosis and address how it is controlled by examining motoneural anatomy and
analyzing electromyograms of muscle activation during normal swimming. The hypothesis
is that all three levels undergo detectable development within the short period chosen-
development that can be correlated as a function of culture time. The experimenters
gained access to colonies of Bonito bred at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. For each of the
first twelve post-hatch days of development (days 2-13), sample Bonito fish were
observed and then injected with a fluorescent dye to fill their motoneurons.
Electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from individual fish from days 2 through 7. The
observations were quantified into behavior statistics which showed that Bonito acquire
swimming behavior quickly. The progression of motoneuron development and trends in
muscle activity led us to a general theory of swimming acquistion in larval Bonito. Based
on all of the data, we believe that Bonito acquire the capability to execute complex
swimming behaviors such as hovering, continuous swimming, and predation as the number
and complexity of motoneurons increases and the ability to coordinate motor units into
sustained firing in addition to variable firing develops.
