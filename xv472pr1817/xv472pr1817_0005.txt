Isozymes
Since electrophoresis for isozymes allows direct
visuglization of the gene products, this technique was used
as a measure of the genetic difference between clonal and
solitary A. elegontissima.
The method used was Brewer's (1970) vertical starch
gel electrophoresis for esterase.
Tissue extracts were prepared from mesenterial filaments
of five clonal and five solitary A. elegantissimg. As an
interspecies and intragenus comparison, two A. xanthogram¬
mica were also run. The mesenterial filaments were excised,
blotted of excess moisture and homogenized in a ground glass
hand homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at
10,000 g for 10 minutes and the liquid supernatant used in
the electrophoresis.
Electrophoresis was carried out for 5 hours at 150
volts and 10 milliamps in a 3°C cold room following Brewer's
(1970) procedure for the esterase system. The gel was sliced
and stained for acid phosphatase activity (Shaw 1970) and
esterase activity (Brewer 1970).
Acid phosphatase activity was located in a faint band
common to both clonal and solitary A. elegantissimg and the
A. xanthogrammicg. These results indicated the similigrities
within the genus Anthopleura and did not resolve any genetic
differences within the species A, elegontissimg.
