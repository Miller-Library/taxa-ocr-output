required an oral disc diameter measurement which was con¬
verted to area by the formuld for the grea of a circle,
The exposed surface area was measured in submerged
animals forced to contract by prodding them with a probe until
no further contraction was noted. The surface gred of
clonals was approximated as a half sphere since their
columns are protected by clonemates. The half sphere gred
was computed by using half the contracted column digmeter
as the value for the radius. The solitary surface grea
was approximated as that of a half sphere plus a cylinder
equal to the exposed column. The method of weighing employed
was reduced weight obtained by weighing the anemone suspended
in sea water. The results are summarized in Table 6. The
clonals have more tentacle grea, oral disc gred, and
exposed grea per mass than the solitary,
DISCUSSION
The results showed differences between clonal and
solitary in their isozyme activity, nematocyst frequencies,
distributions, habitat, and in several measures of surface
area to mass ratios.
The variance in esterase activity and nematocyst per¬
centages are indicative of possible genetic differences
between clonal and soiitary, however there is a strong
possibility that both results are inducible by size. This
influence is suggested by the large clonal with a solitary
esterase banding pattern. Clearer support for size influence
