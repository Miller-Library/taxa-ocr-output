Results for the esterase activity are shown in Figure 1.
The A. xanthogrammica has one intermediate band which makes
its esterase activity pattern distinctly different from the
multi-banded pattern of the A. elegantissimg. The clonal
and solitary A. elegantissimg have a common fast band, but
show some variance in the two slower banding positions. These
two slow banding positions have the characteristics of one
locus with either a homozygous allele resulting in one
band or a heterozygous allele resulting in two bands,
the variation between the clonals and solitaries in the two
slower banding positions is genetic, the differences can
be attributed to any of the following: 1) The clonals and
solitaries have two different loci, 2) It is the same locus,
but different alleles, or 3) The esterase activity is an
inducible isozyme. Support for this last reason of induci¬
bility is seen in slot 14 where a clonal has a slow band
at a position similiar to a solitary's slow band. This
clonal animal has a pedal disc diameter of 8 cm which is
more common of solitaries than clonals.
Morphology
Nematocysts were used as the morphological charac¬
teristic to compare clonal and solitary, since it is a
taxonomic feature used in the classification of seg gne¬
mones (Hand 1955). Nematocysts types were identified and
percentages of the different types determined for the
mesenterial filaments and tentacles.
