METHODS AND RESULTS
Tissue grafts
To determine if there is a difference in tissue compa¬
tibility between the clonal and solitary forms, two methods
of tissue grafting were employed using the following crosses:
1) Self to self, 2) Nonclonemate to nonclonemate, and
3) Clonal to solitary.
The first method involved culturing tissue sections,
The anemones were relaxed in an isotonic MgCly solution
and strips of body wall approximately 10mm X 4 mm X 1 mm
were excised from the pedal disc and column. Tentacle
sections were prepared by excising a whole tentacle.
clipping 1 mm of the tip to remove the aggression receptors
(Francis 1973-b), then slitting one side to produce a sheet
of tissue in a pie wedge shape. The two tissue pieces were
placed side by side with both ectodermal surfaces facing the
same way and the long cut edges in contact. This arrange¬
ment was held firmly between two frames supporting 1 mm nylon
mesh which allowed circulation of water over the tissue,
The frames were incubated in running sea water at about 13
for 7 days. In this manner, 1 series of pedal disc grafts,
1 series of column grafts, and 2 series of tentacle grafts
were prepared.
Grafts were evaluated after 7 days using the following
criterig, fusion was characterized by the tissue sections
remaining intact along 50% of the graft seam and rejection
