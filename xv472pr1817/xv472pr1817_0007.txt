For the nematocyst study of the mesenterial filaments,
six clonals and five solitaries were used. A piece of mesen¬
terial filament was placed on a glass slide and squashed
firmly with the coverslip yielding a slide with identifiable
unfired and fired nematocysts resolvable with a light micro¬
scope. Nematocyst types within random fields were counted
until a total of 200 nematocyst were identified. The following
classifications by Hand (1955) were used to divide the
nematocysts into four groups: 1) Short basitrich 9.0-18.5 X
1.5-2.0 u, 2) Large basitrichs 25.0-39.0 X 3.5-6.0 u, 3) Thin
basitrichs 27.0-48,0 X 0.5-1.5 u, and 4) Microbasic p-masti¬
gophores 11.0-27.0 X 2.0-4.5 u and 18.5-47.5 X 3.5-4.5 u.
The results are compiled in Table 3. There is some
indication that clonals have a greater percentage of small
basitrichs and a lower percentage of large basitrichs than
solitaries, (p slightly greater than 0.05 using Student t test),
Nematocysts of the tentacles were studied in five clonal
and five solitary. The method involved snipping the tip of
the tentacle and treating this piece of tissue in the same
manner as the mesenterial filament preparation. Nematocysts
were counted until 100 were identified. The nematocysts
were classified as either spirocysts 9.0-29.0 X 1.5-3.0 u
or basitrichs 14.0-24.5 X 2.0-3.0 u (Hand 1955).
Results are summarized in Table 4 and show that the
clonals have more spirocysts relative to basitrichs than the
solitaries (p less than 0.05, Student t test).
