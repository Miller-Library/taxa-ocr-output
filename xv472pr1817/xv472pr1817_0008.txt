To determine if the nematocyst frequencies are affected
by the size of the anemone and not necessarily its identity
as clonal or solitary, the nematocysts in the tentacles of
a clone containing varying sizes of animals were examined,
Nematocyst counts of tentacles were taken for two gnemones
at each 1.2 cm increment in pedal disc sized from 2.5 cm to
8.8 cm. Figure 2 shows that as the pedal disc size increases
the relative number of spirocyst decreases (r - 0.89, p is
less than O.01).
Field observations
Field studies were conducted to answer such questions
as the difference in vertical distribution and habitat that
exist between clonal and solitary. The distribution of the
clonal was from 2,5 m in exposed greas with strong wave
action to ,6 m above mean lower low water level, while the
solitary were found from 1.2 m to subtidal depths. In
studying the clonal and solitary habitats the zone of
coexistance became a focus point.
A salient relationship was noted in surge channels in
which both solitaries and clonals were found. These surge
channels ranged in width from 10 to 50 cm and were of yarying
widths, a typical surge channel is illustrated in Figure 3.
Solitary anemones were found more frequently at the mouth of
these channels than within the channel. The reverse relaÂ¬
tionship was seen for clonals. Twelve surge channels were
observed and anemones scored according to whether clonal or
