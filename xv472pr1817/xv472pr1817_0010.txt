The sizes of animals within clones on sloping surfaces
were measured as a function of vertical height for four
clones. The lowest clonals were considered O with the
rest of the clone's position relative to this marker.
Measurements of the anemones' pedal disc size were taken gt
locations 10 cm apart, from O to 30 cm in vertical height.
The results are graphed in Figure 6 and show a linegr
increase in pedaldisc size as the vertical height decregses
(r = 0.73, p is less than O.01).
Surface to mass relationships
The morphology of the clonal and solitary anemone was
studied further by computing the following surface to mass
measurements: 1) Tentacle grea per mass, 2) Oral disc gred
per mass, and 3) Exposed surface ared per mass. Five clondl
and five solitary animals were used, and the data was
obtained in the manner described below.
Tentacle greas and oral disc greas were taken on
anemones induced to expand in a dilute solution of the liquid
supernatant from homogenized squid. For the tentacle greas,
five tentacles were randomly selected from an anemone and
the base diameter and length measured. Using the formuld
for the surface area of a cone, the average surface gred
per tentacle was determined. This value was than multiplied
by the total number of tentacles to givethe total tentacle
surface area for the anemone. The oral disc surfac gred
