was the decrease in tentacle spirocyst percentages with increasing
anemone size within a single clone. Since the enzymes and
nematocysts are an integral part of the feeding process,
these features may be influenced also by diet and feeding
behavior. There is not enough evidence to support genetic
differences as maintaining the two distinct forms,
The existance of the two forms if not genetic, suggests
a phenotypic expression controlled by external forces,
Hand (1955) and Francis (1973-a) attribute the solitary
form to a more protected environment since its size is
more vulnerable to wave shock. I also found solitgries
in protected environments, but found them more frequently
at the mouth of surge channels than clonals, a distribution
pattern which may reflect differences in feeding habits,
I postulate that in surge channels a solitary at the mouth
is feeding on incoming food laden water, the water is
depleted of some of it particles by the solitary and can
support only smaller more efficient clonals further up the
channel. The size gradient observed in clones along surge
channels and vertical faces also fits this model. The
anemones nearest the mouth or lowest in vertical height
are feeding on the most food laden water and thus can grow
larger per unit food gathering greg.
The genetic variation of esterase activity and nemaÂ¬
tocysts are also compatible with the model since they
dre involved in the feeding process and could be influenced
by food availability. Of particular interest is that
