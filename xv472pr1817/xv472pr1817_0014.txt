SUMMARY
Clonal and solitary forms of A. elegantissima were
comparatively studied and found to have differences in
isozyme activity, frequencies in nematocyst types, and
intertidal location. These differences suggested that food
availability was the determining factor in the distribution
and expression of the two forms.
