A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE CLONAL AND SOLITARY FORMS
OF THE SEA ANEMONE ANTHOPLEURA ELEGANTISSIMA
The sea anemone Anthopleurd elegantissimg is referred
to as the aggregating anemone of the middle intertidal
region with an average column diameter of 1.5 inches by
Ricketts and Calvin (1968 ed.). This description overlooked
solitary occuring individuals of A. elegantissimg (Hand 1955),
which I have found to have a vertical distribution that
extends subtidally and a pedal disc diameter up to 15 cm.
Prelimingry field observations suggested to me that there
are two distinct forms of A. elegantissimg, an aggregating
form and a solitary form. Distinctive features of the two
forms include whether the anemone occurs in a dense clonal
aggregation created by asexual reproduction (Francis 1973-a)
or as solitary individuals, size, vertical distribution,
and habitat.
This study had the following objectives: 1) To examine
the differences between the clonal and solitary forms,
2) To determine if the differences are genotypic or phenoÂ¬
typic, and 3) To determine if there are any controlling
influences on the occurence or expression of one form over
the other.
