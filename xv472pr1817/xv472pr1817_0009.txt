solitary, and whether at the mouth or within the channel,
This data is summarized in Table 5 and shows a preferential
diestribution of solitary at the mouth and clonal within the
channel.
Another feature of the surge channel habitat appegred
to be a size gradient as a function of distance from the
channel mouth. Five surge channels were observed. MeasureÂ¬
ments of pedal disc size of both solitaries and clonals were
made. Locations of the anemones measured were 15 cm apart
extending from the mouth to a distance of 45 cms. The pedal
disc size of the anemone was plotted against its distance
from the channel mouth in Figure 4. The data fit a linear
regression (r = 0.87, and p is less than 0.01). It is
apparent that as the distance from the mouth increased,
the pedal disc size decreased,
Variations in size within a clone were noted for several
clones occuppying surge channels or vertical faces. The
clonal members negrest the surge channel mouth or at the
lowest position on a vertical surface approached the size
of solitary anemones. Data for this gradient of size as
a function of distance from the mouth was collected from
4 clones along surge channels. Pedal disc megsurements of
the anemones were taken at locations of 10 cm increments
from the mouth to a distance of 30 cm into the channel.
Results gre graphed in Figure 5 and show a linear increase
in pedal disc size as the distance from the mouth decregses
(r = 0.84, and p is less than O.01).
