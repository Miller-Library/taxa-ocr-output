GENERAL MATERIAL AND METHODS
This study involved the protected rocky intertidal
zone (Ricketts and Calvin 1968 ed.) at Hopkins Marine StaÂ¬
tion and Pt. Pinos in Pacific Grove, Californig. All field
observations and laboratory animals were collected from these
areas.
The following definitions of clonal anemones (hereafter
clonal) and solitary anemones (hereafter solitary) were
used in this study. Clonal was defined as any anemone
failing to show aggression (Francis 1973-b) to a minimum
of one near neighbor or having the characteristic scar and
shortened tentacles indicative of recent fission. A solitary
was defined as any anemone which did not meet either criterig
of clonal.
The anemones used in the laboratory studies were collected
by carefully removing them from the rock substrate with a
spatuld or fingernails. Anemones were allowed to settle
in glass or plastic containers with a continuous flow of
sed water at approximately 13?C. Nonclonemates and solitary
anemones were kept separate to prevent aggression (Francis
1973-b). Anemones were not fed during the study,
Methods used in comparing the clonal and solitary were;
1) Tissue grafting to determine tissue compatibility,
2) Starch gel electrophoresis for isozymes, 3) Morphological
studies of nematocysts, 4) Field observations of distribution
and habitat, and 5) Measurements of surface and mass. Each
method and its results is treated in a separate section.
