FIGURE CAPTIONS
Starch gel electrophoresis stained for esterase
activity. Tissue extracts are from the mesenterial
fildments of 5 clonal and 5 solitary A. elegantissma,
and 2 A. xanthogrammicg. Two clonal anemone tissue
preparations were run in duplicate and the
identical results combined as seen in slot 1 & 2.
and slot 5 & 6.
Graph showing decrease in the percentage of
tentocle spirocysts as function of increasing size,
represented by pedal disc diameter. Sample size
is 10 gnemones from the same clone.
Illustration of a typical surge channel,
Size of gnemone determined by pedal disc diameter
as a function of distance from the mouth of a
surge channel. Data obtained from solitgries
and clonals at 12 surge channels,
Variation in size of clonals as a function of
distance from the mouth of a surge channel.
Data was collected from 4 clones along surge
channels.
Variation in size of clonals as a function of
location on a vertical surface. The lowest
clonal member is 0, with vertical heights being
relative to this marker. Data was obtained from
4 clones along vertical surfaces.
