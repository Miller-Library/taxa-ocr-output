small clonals have more spirocysts than large solitaries.
Spirocysts when discharged create a mesh of entangling
fibers thought to be used in trapping prey (Mariscal 1974).
It would be advantageous for the small clonal to have more
spirocysts since they would be feeding on water relatively
poorer in large pieces of food than the large solitary,
The morphological surface areas to mass can be applied
to the food availability scheme. Tentacle grea per mass
is d measure of feeding efficiency, and the oral disc greg
per mass is a measure of farming efficiency in providing sunÂ¬
light for its algal symbionts. Thus the clonal form is a
more efficient feeder and farmer than the solitary, which
is in keeping with clonal's position in greas of possibly
decreased food availability,
This study best supports the model that solitary and
clonal are phenotypic expressions controlled perhaps by
food availability. The solitary individuals may be less
efficient feeders and are found at surge channel mouths and
at a lower tidal level than the clonals where the availability
of large amounts of food may be greater. The small clongl
is d more efficient feeder and farmer, and is a phenotype
expressed when food availability is low.

Hopkins Marine Station; particularly my advisor Nathan
Howe for his endless help and encouragement, and Phil Murphy
for his expertise with starch gel electrophoresis.
