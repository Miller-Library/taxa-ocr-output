was characterized by anything less than 50%. The results
showing 100% rejection for all crosses and tissue types
are presented in Table 1.
Problems encountered with the first method were tissue
necrosis and muscular action within the tissue which dis¬
rupted the edges in contact. Attempts to correct these
problems were made in the second method of tissue grafting,
In the second method, halves of anemones were used
instead of tissue sections and the halves were stitched
together to maintain contact between the cut edges. The
anemones were relaxed in an isotonic Mgcly solution, then
cut longitudinally in half. For each cross, halves of simi¬
liar size were paired. The column halves were sewed together
with square knots at 6 mm intervals using a curved needle and
cotton thread. The grafts were incubated in running sed
water at approximately 13'C. Two grafts were prepared for
each of the three possible crosses using this method,
The same definitions of fusion and rejection were used
as in the first grafting method. Table 2 shows that after
7 days, rejection was observed in all crosses. The events
leading to the rejection are similiar to asexual division
(Davis, 1972). The halves pinched into two autonomous
animals and moved away from each other. Local necrosis
ground the stiches enabled the thread to cut through the
softened tissue freeing the anemone halves as they separgted.
Results for both grafting methods showed no differential
grafting response among the three crosses. The common
event observed was rejection.
