Figure Legends:
Fig 1. Characteristic responses of cells expressing TRPM7 to changes in external
calcium. Perfusion occurred from 20 to 40 seconds.
a. Individual cells, decreasing [Ca from 2mM to OmM
b. Ten-cell average, decreasing Ca from 2mM to OmM
c. Individual cells, increasing [Ca from OmM to 2mM
d. Ten-cell average, increasing [Ca from OmM to 2mM
Fig 2. Characteristic response to addition of exogenous cyclic AMP. ImM CAMP was
added from 20 to 40 seconds.
a. Individual cells
b. Ten-cell average
Fig 3. Frequency of oscillation in the presence of cGMP and cAMP. The number of
oscillating cells in the region of interest was counted during repeated 2-minute sampling
periods over the course of a 1 hour imaging trial. Heavy black bars indicate the periods in
which the reagents were present.
Fig 4. Oscillations per cell for different pharmacological treatments. Three rectangular
regions were sub-sampled from the video of each trial. Data shown are least-squares means
with error bars connoting standard error. See Appendix A: ANOVA for a more detailed
comparison across treatment groups.
Fig 5. Effects of thapsigargin on internal Cat stores.
a. Addition of TuM thapsigargin occurs from 20 to 40 seconds.
b. [Cai gradually decreases in the subsequent four minutes.
c. Fifteen minutes later, perfusion with 100uM cAMP (from 20-40 s) has no discernible
effect.
Fig 6. Oscillations are broader and less frequent in the presence of staurosporine
a. Representative plot of individual cell oscillations in the presence of 1OuM
staurosporine (compare to Fig 3a)
b. The ratio of peak height to peak width at half height was used as a metric for
comparing peak shapes. Graphed values are means (n-20) with error bars denoting
one standard deviation. Peaks were significantly broader with staurosporine (2-tailed
t-test P.001)
