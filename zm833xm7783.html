INTRODUCTION
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Collisella paradigitalis : Exact'>Collisella paradigitalis</span> (Fritchman, 1960) is a common limpet
of the mid to hugh rocky intertidal occuring along the Bacific
coast from Southwestern Alaska to Northern Baja California. Previously
confused with a South American species, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. strigatella,</span> it is now
recognized as a separate species (Lindberg, 1981). In contrast
to many other species of intertidal Acmaeids, little work has been
done on the biological aspects of this species.
The purpose of this study is to characterize the habitat niche
and activity patterns of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. paradigitalis.</span> To define its habitat
niche, the following aspects were examined: 1) vertical distribution
2) wave exposure 3) orientation of substrate with respect to the
sun 4) orientation with respect to direction of wave action 5) slope
of substrate 6) presence in crevices.
To determine activity patterns, the following questions were
posed: 1) how far do they move? 2) what percent moves per high
tide? 3) is there a home range or restricted area over which these
limpets graze? 4) is there correlation between the size of an animal
and the distance it travels? 5) is there any evidence of homing?
Many of these questions have been studied in other limpet species,
but almost none have been adequately addressed for C. paradigitalis.

DISTRIBUTION
METHODS
All distribution data were collected during morning low tides
during April and May of 1982. All study areas were located on
shoreline behind Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California,
The limpets had a patchy distribution in the study area, and
to maximize data collection, sites were selected which had sig-
nificant populations of C. paradigitalis. These were distributed
along a gradient of wave exposure classified by the average wave
size washing each area. An exposure scale of 4 levels was devised.
and study sites were assigned to these, as follows;
1) Very protected - waves gently lapping on shore. Outer
rocks and islands of rocks blocking main force of waves.
Little or no spray.
2) Moderately protected - waves causing some splash or spray,
Outer rocks blocking most of the waves.
3) Moderately exposed - waves causing quite a lot of splash
with spray. Outer rocks partly blocking waves.
4) Very exposed - waves violently crashing on rocks with much
spray. No outer rocks, waves come in full force.
For each level of exposure, approximately equal areas were surveyed
for limpets.
Intertidal height was determined by surveying points from a
benchmark of known elevation, and then recording the relative heights
for each limpet. In the very exposed study area, there were no
Shabb
benchmarks nearby, so elevations were determined by establishing
tidal level at the time of low low water on a very calm day, and
then measuring intertidal heights relative to this value.
Orientations of the substratum faces upon which limpets were
found were measured by compass and then corrected according to
the declination of the Monterey area. The direction from which
waves were coming relative to each study area was also recorded in
this manner.
The slope of substrate, measured with an inclinometer, was
categorized as being: 1) horizontal, 0 - 30° 2) intermediate,
31 - 59° 3) vertical, 60 - 90° 4) overhanging, greater than 90°.
Presence in crevices was also recorded.
RESULT
Out of 720 limpets observed, the vertical range extends from
f.7 to t3.2 meters over all exposure conditions (Figure 1). The
average density occurs at .27 meters below the <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Endocladia : PartialExact'>Endocladia zone,</span>
which gives a comparative physiological level between sites.
Small standard deviations indicate that the greatest limpet density
actually occurs over a much narrower range. Greater densities of
C. paradigitalis were also found in the more protected areas.
Substrate orientation data indicates a preference for NW and
SE facing rocks (Figure 2), while a closer look suggests that
limpets may orient themselves according to the degree of wave action
they are receiving. Figure 3 compares the number of limpets facing
into the waves with the number facing away from the waves (i.e.,
limpets on the front vs. back sides of rocks). Rocks facing intod
Shabb
the waves were defined as those facing no more than 45° away from
the direction of oncoming waves, while those facing away wer defined
as being 180° opposite in orientation from those facing into the
waves.
The results indicate that more limpets are found facing
toward the waves in protected areas than in exposed areas.
Table 1 gives more information on microhabitat preference,
most notably, that over 902 of the population was found on vertical
or slightly overhanging surfaces, and also that over 502 were found
in crevices. Large numbers were also found totally submerged in
tadepools during low tides, also reported by Fritchman, 1960,
but no data was collected on these animals.
ACTIVITY PATTERNS
METHODS
All data was collected from observations made over a 2 week
period during consecutive low tides from May 11-25, 1982. The study
was conducted with a population of 18 C. paradigitalis in 2 sites
located in a very protected area on the Eastern end of Agassiz Beach
behind Hopkins Marine Station.
The 2 sites where the study was conducted were chosen because
they were typical <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. paradigitalis habitats,</span> they had relatively
flat rock surfaces so that measurements could easily be made, and
easily accessible. The position of each limpet was marked with
nail polish and numbered during low tide on the morning of May II.
At each following low tide until May 25, the location of each limpet
was recorded by using a system of polar coordinates with the origin
Shabb
at the original site of the limpet.
Elevations of the study site ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 meters
above mean low low water.
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the significant behavioral findings. Movement
between low tides ranged from O to 50 cm, averaging 13.4 cm if
periods of inactivity are discounted.
932 of the population moved during high tide with the percentage
dropping sharply if only those moving greater than a certain distance
are considered.
C. paradigitalis occupies a more restricted range than would
be expected, given the average displacement at each high tide.
The ranges were found to have radii from 8 to 80 cm, typically
20 to 25 cm. Figure 5 shows a plot of all the points at which
an individual limpet was found during low tides over 2 weeks. A
circle with a radius of 19 cm encloses all the points.
Only 12 of 18 limpets returned to a specific site over 2 weeks.
Only 3 individuals were observed to return to a specific site more
than once, 1 returning 5 times, and 2 returning twice. The individual
that returned 5 times always returned to the same site with its
head in the same orientation, but orientations in other homers were
not always so precise. The same individual exhibited an activity
pattern, spending 3 consecutive high tides foraging, then 3 at
home. 3 cases were observed where a single site was occupied at
different times by 2 different limpets, not necessarily of the same
Shabb
species (Table 2, bottom).
Figure 7 is a graph which correlates limpet size with average
displacement at high tide. Limpet shell sizes ranged from 8./ to
16.0 mm with average displacement ranging from 3.2 to 22.9 cm per
high tide. The point with the hatched circle is believed to be
an error.
No significant trends were observed when displacements
resulting from night high tides were compared with day highs, of
when high high tides were compared with low high tides.
DISCUSSION
The distribution of C. paradigitalis suggests that the species
is not as resistant to desiccation stress as the higher intertidal
limpets such as C.scabra and C. digitalis whose niches were described
by Stoner B. Haven, 1973, and physiological tolerances determined
for them by Walcott, 1973. This assumption is reinforced by its
tendency to occupy vertical faces, crevices, tidepools, and areas
which face toward the waves in protected areas, all positions
which would reduce desiccation stresses and maximize water retention.
C. paradigitalis can commonly be found low on the rocks buried in
the sand after receding tides, a very protected environment which
is moist, dark, and safe from possible predation by starfish or
birds (Hahn, 1982).
Physiological factors are not the sole determinants of the
distribution of C. paradigitalis. The decrease in density of
C. paradigitalis in areas exposed to heavy surf suggests that it may
Shabb
suffer in competition from C. digitalis which is most similar to
it in habitat niche, and flourishes in wave swept areas.
Competition may also be very significant in determining
orientations either facing toward or away from waves in varying
exposure conditions, which would further take it out of competition
with C. digitalis.
Substrate orientation data (Figure 2), may best be explained
by relating the directions which study sites faced with the direction
of oncoming waves. All of the study areas faced toward the ocean
in a range from NW to NE, the density of organisms facing NW is a
result of the great number of limpets facing into the waves in the
protected areas, while the density facing SE is a result of those
facing away from the waves in the more exposed areas.
Activity patterns are also strongly influenced by physiological
factors and competition.
If the distance travelled by a limpet is directly proportional
to its foraging area, Figure 5 would suggest that larger limpets
need to forage over greater distances than smaller limpets. A
foraging range or territory (example, Figure 4) would be important
in determining spatial distribution so that competition could be
minimized and grazing areas could be most efficiently utilized
at high limpet densities. If a home range exists it is possible
that limpets occasionally return to sites offering physiological
advantages which may explain why some C. paradigitalis exhibit
occasional homing behavior, a phenomenon which requires further
study.

SUMMARY
Distribution
1) Vertical distribution: .7 - 3.2 meters above MLLW with average
density .27 meters below Endocladia zone.
2) Wave exposure: greatest densities occur in protected areas where
more face into the waves than in exposed areas.
3) Orientation of substrate: main density of organisms facing
toward NW or SE. NW density faces into the waves in protected
areas. SE density faces away from waves in exposed areas.
4) Slope of substrate: 912 of sample population found on
vertical or slightly overhanging surfaces.
5) Crevices: 552 of population found in crevices.
Activity patterns
1) Average distance moved during high tide = 13.4 cm.
2) Approximately 772 of the population moves greater than 5 om during
a high tide.
3) Homing ranges with radii from 8 to 80 cm have been determined
with the average between 20 and 25 cm.
4) A correlation exists between the size of a limpet and its average
distance moved per high tide. The larger the limpet, the greater
the travelling distance.
5) Very infrequent homing in 672 of the population.
