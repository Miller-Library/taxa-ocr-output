Blazyk 13
To increase the usefulness of this study, I would like to increase sample sizes from each
location, while adding additional locations to the north and south, to investigate further the
apparent effect of isolation by distance. Also, I plan to sequence additional sections of COI, or a
section of another gene to isolate a greater number of polymorphic sites that would add power to
f√ºrther resolve genetic differences between populations. With current populations and sample
sizes, there are no apparent significant differences, suggesting fairly high levels of gene flow.
However, Fsr does increase significantly with distance, which shows that there is not unlimited
exchange of larvae between all locations studied. Rather, there is a balance between fairly high
larval exchange and isolation by distance in Tegula funebralis between Oregon and southern
California.
