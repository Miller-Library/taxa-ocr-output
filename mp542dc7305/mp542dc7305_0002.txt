INTRODUCTION
Many marine invertebrates are sessile and may live their entire adult lives within a few
square meters of space. Therefore, the genetic makeup of populations is largely due the nature of
larval dispersal and development (Hoskin 1996). The pelagic larval phase of some invertebrates
is the one chance that animal has to spread its genes to another (possibly quite distant) location.
It is then to be expected that invertebrates that lay egg cases would have genetically distinct
populations on a much smaller scale than species that have pelagic larvae.
Pelagic larvae of invertebrates can drift in the oceans for anywhere between a few days to
several months. Off the west coast of North America, where the California Current moves at an
average rate of 10 cm/s (Debenham et al. 2000), larvae have the potential to move from tens to
thousands of kilometers. However, in many cases, species exhibit a more limited dispersal than
is predicted by the duration of their pelagic larval phase. This can be explained by natural
selection, larval behavior, including vertical migration and swimming, eddies and other
counteracting currents, and by possible physical boundaries to dispersal.
Because it is very difficult to directly measure larval dispersal distances, other, indirect
measures are used. One such tool is analyzing genetic differences between populations. This
evaluation, when compared to genetic variation within populations, gives a good idea of the
amount of larval exchange between populations. One migrant per generation prevents the
accretion of large genetic differences, and ten migrants per generation stops all but very minor
differences from appearing.
Possible barriers to dispersal include Point Conception, where the California coast turns
sharply eastward, moving away from the stream of the California Current, Monterey Bay, and
San Francisco Bay. However, these features seem to not always impede dispersal.
