APPENDIX 2: FIGURES
Fig. 1: Map of the west coast of the United States with collection sites marked in red.
Fig. 2: Example of an unsuccessful PCR, with products run on a 2% agarose gel. There are no
clear bands, even for the positive control. The lane of many bands is the 1kB standard.
Fig. 3: Example of a successful PRC, with products run on a 2% agarose gel. There are clear
bands at about 700bp for most samples, including the positive control, and an empty lane for the
negative control. The 1kB standard is in the first lane.
Fig. 4: Parsimony tree produced with all 68 sequences. Horizontal branch lengths represent
numbers of nucleotide changes. Included are three major clades used in analysis.
Fig. 5: Minimum spanning tree with identical sequences grouped in circles and divergent
sequences radiating outwards on branches proportional to the number of nucleotide changes.
Fig. 6: Plot of pairwise Fsr versus distance (km), including negative values of FsT.
Fig. 7: Plot of pairwise Fsr versus distance (km), with negative values of Fsr changed to zero.
