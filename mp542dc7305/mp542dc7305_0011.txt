and the mostly small/insignificant Fsr values), there is probably an isolation by distance effect
acting as well. Isolation by distance is based on the stepping stone population model, which is
the theory that gene flow is restricted with increasing geographic distance, resulting in a genetic
structure. This is likely more realistic than the island model, since populations very far apart
would be expected to exchange fewer individuals than closer populations, even if the species has
a moderate or high dispersal potential.
I then calculated values of Nm for each of the pairwise combinations including Oregon
that had a positive Fsr (using the formula Fsr = 1/(4Nm+1)). The Oregon and Lompoc
populations gave an Nm of about 3, which represents the number of migrants per generation
between those two populations (Bohonak 1999). Exchange rates between Oregon and the other
locations had an average of about 7 migrants per generation, although one site suggested an Nm
as high as 40. Even with a rate as low as 3-7 migrants per generation, any major genetic
differences between populations would be prevented.
Numerous studies mentioned previously, as well as my results, support the likelihood that
many species with pelagic larvae have relatively high gene flow along this coast. Ford and
Mitton (1993) and Debenham et al. (2000) showed that Point Conception and Monterey Bay do
not obstruct dispersal of the pink barnacle or the red sea urchin, respectively. In the present
study, suggested barriers such as Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay appear to not impede
dispersal very significantly, at least not to an extent detectable with the statistical power of my
data.
The connection between Tegula population structure and implications for marine reserves
may not be immediately apparent, since it is unlikely a reserve would ever be created for the
purpose of protecting these snails. However, many other marine species (including several
