Miner (2002) found that although there appear to be two distinct physiological races of
Pollicipes polymerus (gooseneck barnacle, with a pelagic larval phase of up to 40 days), which
divide at Point Conception, there were no differences in the genetic makeup of individuals
spanning this range. Tetraclita squamosa rubescens (pink barnacle) appear to have high gene
flow along a range from San Francisco to south of Point Conception. However, the population at
Moss Landing, at the center of Monterey Bay, does seem to have a higher level of isolation than
the rest, which could indicate more larval retention in some populations than others (Ford and
Mitton 1993).
Debenham et al. (2000) shows that in Strongylocentrotus franciscanus (red sea urchin,
with a pelagic larval phase of 61 to 131 days), there is high gene flow throughout the species
range from Alaska to Baja California. Samples from Alaska did seem to deviate slightly from
the rest, possibly indicating a more limited exchange of larvae, selection, or evidence of selective
mating.
In a study of Haliotis cracherodii (black abalone, with a pelagic larval phase of 5 to 15
days), Hamm and Burton (2000) conclude that there are significant differences between
populations of abalone between Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, although genetic difference does
not correlate with geographic distance. This indicates that black abalone might be fairly poor in
dispersing larvae even moderate distances, which is consistent with observations of pink and
green abalone dispersal.
Buonaccorsi et al. (2002) studied Sebastes caurinus (copper rockfish, with a pelagic
phase of several months) from Canada to south of Point Conception. Among these samples,
there was evidence of significant divisions between populations, as well as a positive correlation
between geographic and genetic distance.
