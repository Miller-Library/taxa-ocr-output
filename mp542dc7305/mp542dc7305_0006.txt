Blazyk 6
(1998)—50 sec at 94°C, 90 sec at 50’C, and 90 sec at 72°C, but for 30 cycles instead of 25 and
700
without the 8 min extension time at /z’C. The Folmer et al. (1994) primers: HCO2198 (5’-
TAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3’) and LCO1490 (S’GGTCAACAAATCATA
AGATATTGG-3’) were used to amplify a section of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). Some other
primers were tried, without success, including LCO/HCO (which are the same as 1490/2198 but
are not degenerate), COla/COlf, and 2198/conch2f. PCR products were run in 2% agarose gels
to identify the samples that successfully amplified, producing a distinct band, about 700bp in
length.
DNA sequencing
To remove excess dNTPs and primers, 5 ul of PCR products of successfully amplified
samples were then added to 2 ul shrimp alkaline phosphotase (SAP), 1 ul exonuclease 1 (EXÖ),
and 0.5 ul SAP buffer. The samples are then held at 37°C for 30 minutes and 80°C for 15
minutes. To add fluorescent markers for sequencing, 2 ul of the SAP/EXO products were added
to 6 ul dd H20, 1 ul big dye, 1.5 ul 5X buffer, and 0.5 ul of either 1490 or 2198 (for forward and
reverse sequences). The samples were then cycle sequenced with 25 cycles of heating to 96°C
for 10 seconds, 50°C for 5 seconds, and 60°C for 4 minutes.
After the samples cycle sequenced, 40 ul 75% isopropanol was added to each, and they
were let to stand for 15 minutes. The samples were then spun at room temperature at about 3000
rpm for an hour to form DNA pellets. The tubes were then uncapped, turned over, and spun for
two minutes at 700 rpm to remove excess fluid. To resuspend the DNA, 20 ul of hi-di was
added to each tube. The tubes were then vortexed to ensure the DNA mixed in the hi-di and then
briefly spun to bring all the liquid to the bottom of the tubes. The samples were heated at 96°C
