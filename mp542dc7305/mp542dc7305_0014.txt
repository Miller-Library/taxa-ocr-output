ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Stephen Palumbi for being a great advisor and knowing the level of
involvement that allowed me to learn and explore things myself, without ever feeling completely
lost. Also, thanks to Emily, who also worked on snail genetics, and who knows everything about
scientific labs, having spent many summers in such thrilling environments. I also owe a lot to
everyone in the Palumbi lab—Vollmer, Julie, Laura, Cathy, Roxanna, Tom, and Adam. You
guys always helped me out, answered my questions, and even took the time to speculate with me
about Tegula genetics. I would also like to thank the other 175H professors—George Somero
for being a wonderful advisor and helping me get snails from various locations, and Mark Denny
and Jim Watanabe for general advice and input. Lastly, thanks to all the sea kids for making the
first five weeks of the quarter raucous and fun, and to all the other 175H/176H students for the
lovely, although somewhat quieter, times the rest of the quarter.
