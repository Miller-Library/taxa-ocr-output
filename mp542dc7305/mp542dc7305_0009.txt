(Tables 3 and 4) and graphed these values over distance (Fig. 6). Here, the linear regression line
had an R“ of 0.5035 and a slope of 1x10“, with p = 0.000. Changing negative values of Fsr to
zero (Fig. 7), the linear regression had an R* of 0.5894 and a slope of 5x10%, still with p - 0.000.
DISCUSSION
From the parsimony tree, no striking structure or clades corresponding to locations are
evident. There appear to be individuals from each location spread throughout the tree. However,
upon closer inspection, some subtle patterns are noticeable. For example, Clade II is made up of
eight individuals, four of which are from the Oregon population. None of the other four
members of this clade is from south of Soberanes. With current sample sizes, this is not
conclusive, yet may suggest that structure is not truly lacking.
The results of the chi-squared test show that there is not a significant difference between
the distribution of snails from Oregon, Lompoc, and the remaining samples across the three
clades specified. The test was not too far from significant, with p - 0.08, giving further reason to
think that a larger sample size could resolve some hints of differences in structure between
populations.
Using the principles of the island model, in which all populations have an equal chance
to exchange individuals, Wright and Malécot first developed analyses of the relatedness of
populations in the 1940s. Wright, in fact, derived the formula for Fsr, relating it to population
size and migration rate (Fsr = 1/(4Nm+1)). The “st“ stands for the relationship between the
subpopulation and the total population, and is a type of "inbreeding coefficient" (Templeton
2003). This has now become one of the most standard measures in population genetics to show
population structure.
