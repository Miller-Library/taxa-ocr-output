for two minutes to denature the DNA. Äfter cooling to room temperature, the samples were
transferred to a sequencing plate and sequencing using an ABI3 100 Genetic Analyzer.
Post-sequencing analysis
Äfter sequencing, the files were cleaned and sorted, using Sequencher 4.1. The forward
and reverse files for each snail were combined to create one consensus sequence per snail. These
consensuses were accumulated into a master contig, which was used in making trees and in
statistical analysis. PAUP*4.Ob10 (PPC) was used to make parsimony trees with branch lengths
in terms of numbers of nucleotide changes. Structure among clades was analyzed using
contingency tables and chi-squared values with the program ChiSquare v1.0. To compare
diversity within sequences from one location to diversity of sequences among two or more
locations, Fsr values were calculated. This was done using heap big Power Mac, programmed
by Stephen Palumbi. Pairwise Fsr values (between each pair of locations) were then correlated
with distance between populations to examine whether values increased with distance, as would
be expected by the isolation by distance model.
RESULTS
Amplification and Sequencing
The first several PCR conditions tried were unsuccessful, producing no visible bands of
products, including the positive control (Fig. 2). In these unsuccessful reactions, I was using
0.15 ul of enzyme (both AmpliTag and DNAzymeEXT), as well as a number of different primer
pairs, including 1490/2198, LCO/HCO, COla/COIf, and conch 2F/2198. After doubling the
amount of enzyme per reaction to 0.30 ul, and using the degenerate primers 1490 and 2198, I
was finally able to consistently produce successful reactions (Fig. 3). In this figure, bands of
