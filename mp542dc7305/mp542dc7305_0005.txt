geographic difference, which indicates that more structure may resolve with larger sample sizes
and additional populations further to the north and south.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Populations sampled
T. funebralis were collected from seven sites along the west coast of the United States
(Table 1; Fig. 1). These areas include Strawberry Hill, Oregon (44°15’42'’N, 124°07’36°W),
Bodega Bay, California (38°19’N, 123°04’W), just outside the breakwater at Pillar Point, near
Half Moon Bay, California (37°29’42"’N, 122°29’42"’W), exposed and protected regions of the
rocky intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California (36°37’N, 121°54’W), the
rocky intertidal at Soberanes Point, California (36°27’092’N, 121°55’45’’W), San Luis Harbor,
San Luis Obispo, California (35°10’36'’N 120°45’36’’W), and Lompoc, California (34°43’N,
120°34’)
DNA isolation
To isolate DNA, all snails were relaxed in a 1:3 mixture of isotonic MgClz and seawater.
Once relaxed, small bits of tissue were snipped from the edge of the snails' feet. This tissue was
then processed with the Nucleospin kit, extracting relatively clean DNA. The products were run
on a 2% agarose gel, showing bright bands corresponding to DNA. The extracted DNA was
diluted with water to a 1:10 solution, which was used in PCR.
mtDNA amplification
1 ul of the 1:10 DNA was used as a template in a 25 ul polymerase chain reaction
comprising 2.5 ul 1Ox AmpliTaq buffer, 2.5 ul 1Ox dNTPs, 0.30 ul AmpliTaq polymerase, and
1.25 ul each of the forward and reverse primers. Amplification conditions were as in Hellberg
