ABSTRACT
Potential for gene flow in marine environments is often much higher than what is actually
observed, due to various barriers to dispersal. Understanding the divisions between populations
of organisms is important to fishery regulations and designing effective marine reserves. Tegula
funebralis have a pelagic larval phase, lasting 5-14 days, giving them a moderate potential for
dispersal. Samples ranging from Oregon to Santa Barbara were collected from seven geographic
locations. A 700 base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was
sequenced for an average of 9 individuals from each location. Comparing these sequences, there
is no clear overall population structure, although there seem to be some slight patterns
corresponding to geographic location. In particular, snails from Oregon are more similar to each
other and are more different from snails from other populations, suggesting a lower level of
dispersal between T. funebralis from Oregon and the more southern locations. These smaller
signals could not be shown to be significant with the current sample sizes, using Fsr values or
chi-squared tests, and had p values of between 0.07 and 0.10. Overall, there appears to be a
fairly high level of gene flow across the range studied, which makes it unlikely that there are
major barriers to dispersal in this range. However, there may be subtle population structure in T.
funebralis along the west coast of North America that will emerge when larger sample sizes from
each location are used, a larger portion of the gene is sequenced, and populations further to the
north and south are sampled.
