amplified DNA about 700bp long are visible. About 90% of the PCR products sequenced
produced clean enough data to be used in analysis. In total, there were 67 sequences from snails
from seven locations, giving an average of about ten sequences per location.
Parsimony and Minimum Spanning Trees
I first created a parsimony tree with the 67 sequences I had produced, plus the published
sequence for Tegula funebralis COI found on GENBANK, which represents an individual from
Baja California (Fig. 4). This tree is one of a hundred randomly generated trees, all of which
contained the same major clades, including matching groupings of snails. These trees represent
the most parsimonious relationship between the snails, meaning that each base change occurs as
few times as possible (ideally, just once). This same data can be viewed in another way as a
minimum spanning tree (Fig. 5). Here, identical sequences are grouped together in circles, with
divergent sequences radiating out from those circles on branches proportional in length to the
number of nucleotide changes that occur in the sequence.
Statistical Analysis
First, I selected three major clades from the parsimony tree (Fig. 4). I chose these clades
because they seemed to be the largest groupings of sequences. Most of the other branches on the
tree led to only one or two individual snail sequences. I then examined the makeup of these
major clades by creating a contingency table (Table 2). To test whether the distribution of clades
in any location was significantly different from the total, I used a chi-squared test. The true
value of chi-square was 9.828, with p = 0.08 + 0.05 (not significant).
To compare diversity between locations to diversity within locations, l used the measure
of Fsr. Including all seven populations as separate demes, Fsr was negative (although not
significantly different from zero). I then calculated pairwise Fsr values for all pairs of locations
