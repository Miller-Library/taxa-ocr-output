ESCUSSIO
Much variation between different experiments was found which
can probably be attributed to the aforementioned difficulties of
classifying embryos with respect to age. Irrespective of these
variations, it was found that the early stages always incorporated
Aal
less amino acid into protein than the later stages, and that
Tyu
peak incorporation occurred at stages C-E.
Interpretation of the above data is complicated by an apparent
bypassing of the endogenous amino acid pool by the added C-Il amino
acids. The data show that at low external amino acid concentrations
———
(Fig. 1-111) greater than 503 of the amino acid taken into the cell
(ct. Bres, 1063)
was incorporated into protein. As Bala
glandula probably con-

tains a large amino acid "pool", the high percentage
o
of incorporation observed can be explained by a bypassing of the

merbrane into the cell, or by isotope discrimination. A similar
type of compartmentation has been suggested to exist in the sea
te Ge
ax
urchin embryo (Berg, 1965). This compartmentation, if it is this,
is much larger in barnacle embryos, and may seriously hinder the
interpretation of results obtained with C-11 amino acids. If this
compartmentation is of similar magnitude throughout all stages,
however, the general pattern found for incorporation is probably
correct.
The above results also indicated that barnacle embryos can
utilize exogenous amino acids. It is interesting that two of the
amino acids used, leucine and lysine, are also found in the fluid
