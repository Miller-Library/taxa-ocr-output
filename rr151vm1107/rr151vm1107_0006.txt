fraction differed yith the different developmental stages.There
was usually variation between experiments but the radioactivity
of the TCA-soluble fraction was generally the highest apt one of

the three early stages (see figure 1). Figure 1 also shows dif¬

ferences between leucine and lysine uptake in different experiments.
This differenco is apparently real, and does not result from the
difficulties in staging the embryos, since the lamellae used to
compare leucine and lysine uptake were taken from the same animal.
insoluble Phase
TCA¬
Incorporation of labeled leucine and lysine was always lowest
at stage B (blastoderm migration over the yolk) and generally in-
creased to a peak at stages C-E (segmentation of the blastoderm
to demarcation of the limb buds). The rate always decreased to

slightly lower levels at the later stages.
Total Incorporation
The total amount of C-11 lysine and C-1 leucine found within
the egg was always greater than the concentration of the C-1h amino acid
external to the eggs. The ratio of these concentrations (inside/
outside) varied from.8 to 8.0, suggesting a type of active trans-
port for these eggs. Although total uptake increased with increas-
ing amounts of added C-14 amino acid, the ratio inside/outside
decreased, suggesting a saturation of the "active transport" sys¬
tem.
Table ! is a listing of the calculated numerical results of
the experiment illustrated in figure 1-1. All of the data used
to plot the graphs were compiled in this way for each experiment.
