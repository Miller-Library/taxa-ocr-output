but in the process of hatching).
Volume Determination
Cirriped eggs are especially difficult to work with since dur-
ing the earlier stages they are held tightly together in the ovig-
erous lamellae and cannot be washed free of this tissue. Since
fferent sets of eggs had to be compared on a volume basis in order

to calculate the results of the experiments this proved to be a
ss tupeete o
complication. As a result, a method for determining the volume of
the eggs was devised.
Pieces of ovigerous lamellae were weighed and the number of
eggs in the pieces counted. From this a curve was prepared establish¬

ing a wet weight:number-of-eggs relationship (only an approximation
since weight density changes during development, described by Barnes,
1965, were disregarded). The volume of a single egg was then cal¬
culated from the egg dimensions, assuming that the egg has the shape

of an oblate spheroid of volume 1/3 Nabe (a=60,1 b-984). The volume
of a single egg was calculated to be 1.16 X 10-° ml. With this a

Preparation of the Ee
A number of micro-organisms was sometimes found on the surface
of the tissue binding the eggs together and on the eggs themselves.
