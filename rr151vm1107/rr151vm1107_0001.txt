That adult marine invertebrates can concentrate amino acids

irom a dilute solution has now been demonstrated for several dif-
ferent organisms (Stephens and Schinske, 1961; Stephens, 1963, 1961:
Ferguson, 1967). Recent studies have shown that sea urchin embryos
can likewise transport exogenous amino acid and incorporate it in-
to their protein (Mitchison and Cummins, 1966; Epel, 1967) and that
there is an increased rate of both uptake and incorporation follow-
ing fertilization (Hultin, 1953; Gross, 1961; Epel, 1967). In

these eggs the incorporation(peaks) at the mid-gastrula stage and
e
subsequently decreases (Guidice, Vittorelli and Monroy, 1962).
Little data is available, however, on rates of protein synthesis
in the later larval stages.
The present report concerns experiments on uptake and incorp-
oration of C-Il lysine and C-14 leucine by embryos of the barn-
acle,
anus glandula (Darwin). Six distinct stages of develop-
ment have been used in this study, ranging from early cleavage
stages through the hatching nauplius.
The results of this research indicate that there are one
herk

and possibly two peaks in the rate of incorporation of amino acids
between cleavage of the first blastomere and hatching.
As was
had chee ef eune
found with sea urchins, one of these is (around the mid-gastrula
tage. This study also suggests that these embryos possess a
transport system for concentration of amino acid.
