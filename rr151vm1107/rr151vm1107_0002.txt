Adults of Balanus glandula were collected from rocks on China
Point near the Hopkins Marine Station and transferred immediately
a
to the lab where they were maintained in a circulating water bath
at 16° C. The embryos (found in sheet-like plates known as ovig-
erous lamellae) were then taken from the barnacles, observed under
a compound microscope to determine the stage of development,
weighed, and immersed in millipore-filtered sea water at 16° C.
All tests were made within two hours (of removing the barnacles ote vwee
from the rocks and no longer than one hour after the ovigerous lam¬
ellae were taken from the mantle cavity. All incubations with the
C-1l amino acids were performed at pH 7.7, which corresponds to
the pH of the mantle cavity fluid.
Classification of the Embryonic Stages
The classification of the developmental stages is adapted from
that described by Barnes (1965) for Balanus balanoides and Balanus
balanus. The stages used herein have been characterized in the
following manner.
B. the formation and growth of the blastoderm over the yolk,
C. the formation of the mesoblast and hypoblast (segmentation
of the blastula),
E. demarcation of the nauplius appendages (Barnes' stages D
and E),
F. the development of the appendages and the origin of the
