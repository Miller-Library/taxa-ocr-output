Isotopes
The specific activities of the uniformly labeled C-11 amino
acids (International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation) were:
C-14 lysine, 200 mc/m; C-1h leucine, 198 mc/mM.

For all developmental stages determinations were made of the
amount of free isotope in the TCA-soluble phase and the amount of
isotope incorporated into protein (TCA-insoluble phase). The degree
of active uptake was estimated by comparing the total uptake into
the eggs with the a mount of isotope originally present in an equal
erca
volume of external medium.
As the different lamellae varied in size, the results are
expressed in counts per minute/gram wet weight. This mode of ex-
pression allows a comparison of thé different stages with other.

However, absolue comparison between stages is extremely difficult
since a long developmental sequence has been here arbitrarily div¬
letaen
ided into six phases. The actual time from fertilization to fully¬
formed nauplius is not known for B. glandula, but estima tes from
other species suggest that the duration is at least twenty-four
days. Thus, stages placed in the same category (e.g., Stage E)
might actually be four to six days apart in time since fertilizat¬
ion.
CA-soluble Phase
In all experiments C-1 amino acid was found in the TCA-soluble
fraction of the embryos, and the amount of labeled amino acid in this
