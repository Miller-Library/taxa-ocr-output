In order to be reasonably certain that these and any traces of bact¬
eria present would not affect the results of the experiments ad¬
versely the ovigerous lamellae were washed h-6 times with millipore-
filtered sea water amd incubated in sea water containing .25 mg/ml
streptomycin (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 150 units/ml penicillin (Sigma
Chemical Co.).
Isotope Incorporation
In all of the experiments the pair of lamellae from one barnacle
was separated and one lamella was incubated with C-11 lysine while
the other was incubated with C-14 leucine. Three different con¬
centrations of amino acid was used:.1c/ml sea water, .33/c/ml
20
we u
and 1.7c/ml.The duration of the incubations was twenty minutes.
After incubation the samples were washed with 0.001 M C-12
mino acid and then 2ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to the
washed eggs in a Dounce homogenizer. The eggs were then homogen-
ized and the TCA-homogenate centrifuged at 1130g for 15 minutes in
a Servall RC-2B centrifuge. Part of the TCA-soluble supernatant
was then collected, extracted twice with either, dried on a
e
planchet and (its activity counted in a Nuclear Chicago gas flow
counter with mica window.

The TCA-insoluble precipitate was resuspended in the TCA and
mg of bovine serum albumin was added. This was then heated for
twenty minutes at 90° C, filtered through 24 Schleicher & Schuell
glass fiber filters and the residue then washed four times with 5%
TCA-O.O5 M C-12 amino acid and twice with ether:ethanol:chloroform
uhe
(2:2:1). The filters were glued to planchets and counted as above.
