Dear Dr. Epel,
I am wondering if you have had time to read my
paper again and pass any kind of judgement on it. I understand
that you are probably pretty busy with your summer course so
I don't mean to push you into anything. What I really want is
an opinion. I have been asked by a medical school to which
I am applying to write a short essay about any subject which I
have studied and feel confident with. My studies last quarter
would be ideal for this I think but I'm still not sure if you
think my findings are valid enough. I suppose this is related
to whether or not my paper is publishable. Any opinions of
yours at this time would be appreciated.
I certainly hope that the sun is shining a little
brighter now than it did last qurter and that "Big Bertha" is
functioning for Raffin!
Sincerely,
Ao
