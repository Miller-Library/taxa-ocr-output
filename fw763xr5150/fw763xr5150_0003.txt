unaffected during twenty-four hours incubations in these inhibitors, indicating that
NAD kinase is stable and is not degraded or synthesized during development.
The sensitivity of the enzyme activity to different concentrations of free
calcium was also tested to find out if there was a correspondence between changes
in the intracellular levels of calcium and enzyme activity. NAD kinase was found to
be activated to its maximal level at a calcium concentration between 10-6M and
10-7M.
