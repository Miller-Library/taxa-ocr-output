ABSTRACT
The ability of calcium to turn on the calmodulin-activated enzyme NAD
kinase was tested at different stages in the development of sea urchin embryos
during the first 24 hours after fertilization. It was found that NAD kinase is a stable
enzyme and that its calcium-dependency does not change throughout development.
Tests on NAD kinase from eggs grown in emetine, an inhibitor of protein
synthesis, and actinomycin, an inhibitor of RNA transcription, revealed that the
enzyme is neither translated or resynthesized during the first twenty four hours. A
calcium sensitivity curve was plotted for the enzyme and correlations between the
critical concentrations of free calcium for the activation of NAD kinase and the
actual calcium levels in the eggs are discussed.
