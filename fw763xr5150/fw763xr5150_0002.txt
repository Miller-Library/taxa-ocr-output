INTRODUCTION
One of the many calcium-induced changes occurring at fertilization in the
sea urchin egg is the activation of NAD kinase, the enzyme responsible for the
conversion of NAD into NADP. NAD kinase is a calmodulin-dependent enzyme
and is thereby turned on directly by the post-fertilization increase in calcium levels.
Though NAD kinase is responsible for NADP synthesis in all eukaryotic
cells, little is known about the role of this enzyme or its product. There is a small
amount of literature hinting at possible regulatory roles for the enzyme. Mitogen
stimulation of lymphocytes has been shown to cause an increase in NADP levels
(Berger et al, 1987). NAD kinase activity also changes upon photostimulation and
during spore germination in Neurospora (Afanasieva et al, 1982). Finally,
circadian variations in the affinitiy of NAD kinase have been observed in Euglena
(Laval-Marten et al, 1990).
Unpublished work of Robert Sweezy in David Epel's laboratory indicated
an apparent shift in the calcium dependency of NAD kinase at fertilization in sea
urchin eggs and this was the starting point for my project. I wanted to test for
alterations in the enzyme that may occur at fertilization and trace its activity
throughout development in hopes of elucidating any possible regulatory roles of
NAD kinase.
Calcium activation of the enzyme was tested before and after fertilization
and then at various stages in development. Surprisingly, NAD kinase retained its
calcium sensitivity after fertilization. To investigate the turnover rate of NAD
kinase, embryos were grown in emetine, an effective protein synthesis inhibitor in
sea urchin eggs (Hogan and Gross, 1971), and also in actinomycin, an RNA
translation inhibitor (Gross et al, 1964). I found that NAD kinase levels were
