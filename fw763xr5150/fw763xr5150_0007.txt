before or after calcium stimulation (Fig. 3). Again, high variability was seen in the
enzyme activity rates.
Calcium Sensitivity
Testing the NAD kinase activity at different calcium concentrations revealed
the enzyme to be fully activated at free calcium concentrations between 10-M and
10-OM (Fig. 4). There was some activity even at concentrations below 10-7M and
to turn the enzyme off completely, free calcium had to be dropped to 10-9M.
Because of the high pH sensitivity of the EGTA-calcium complex, it was difficult to
pinpoint the exact calcium concentration at which the enzyme reached its maximal
activity. Figure 4 shows a calcium sensitivity curve done on embryos prepared
ten minutes after fertilization. Repeats of this experiment using unfertilized eggs
and embryos one hour after fertilization confirmed these findings. The low rates of
activity at 10 and 10-8M concentrations resembled the off rate activity of the
enzyme while the rates at 10-Â°M and higher concentrations of calcium were similar
to the on rates.
