ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
First and foremost, I thank David Epel for his direction, patience and
constant enthusiasm throughout the quarter. I also thank Chris Patton, Rob
Sweezy, and Paul Sun for all their help in the lab. Special thanks go to my
roommate Aimee Sison who put up with all my ups and downs for the past ten
weeks and to Roger Cornwall for the endless supply of Diet Cokes and ice cream
during long hours in lab. Finally, I thank all my fellow 175H spring students for
making this quarter a lot of fun and the rest of the faculty and staff at Hopkins for
making us feel so welcome.
