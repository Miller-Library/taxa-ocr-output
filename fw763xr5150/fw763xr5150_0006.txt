RESULTS
NAD Kinase During Normal Development
Aliquots of the developing embryos were taken at three hour intervals and
the enzyme extracts assayed for activity. In all enzyme assays, the rates of activity
as indicated by increase in fluorescence from rising NADPH levels were
standardized using values obtained from the protein assay. Fig.1 shows the rates
of activity before and after stimulation by calcium. As seen, sensitivity to calcium
did not change during development. There was a puzzling variability in rates at the
different time points. Unfortunately, only one time series was done, but it appears
that there no major changes in NAD kinase in the early stages. Possibly, there is an
increase at 18 to 21 hours.
NAD Kinase Activity DÃ¼ring Development in Actinomycin D
In agreement with Gross et al (1964), embryos developed normally in the
RNA transcription inhibitor Actinomycin up to the blastula stage, but became
arrested at the 18 hour point. There was no apparent effect on NAD kinase level.
nor was there any effect on the ability of the enzyme to be stimulated by calcium.
(Fig 2) Again, puzzling variability in the enzyme activity was seen during
development.
NAD Kinase Activity During Development in Emetine
Emetine is an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and as described by Wagenaar
and Mazia (1978), the fertilized eggs did not divide and were arrested at the single
cell stage. With the lack of proteins needed to undergo mitosis, the eggs gradually
became deformed as time progressed and lysis was seen in some eggs by the 20th
hour. There was no drop in enzyme activity during this twenty hour time period
