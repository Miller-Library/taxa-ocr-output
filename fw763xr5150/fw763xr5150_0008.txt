DISCUSSION
In the three different conditions of raising embryos in this study (control,
actinomycin, emetine), none showed a decrease in the ability of calcium to activate
NAD kinase, nor were there major effects on maximal activity. Unfortunately, the
extreme variations in the rates of activity seen at different time points in all three
conditions have no logical explanation. Though the first set of assays were more
consistent and constant than the two following (Fig. 1,2,3), the rates still varied
widely. Sampling error could account for some of the variation though it cannot
not alone explain the results obtained. Perhaps there was some modification due to
toxic effects of the inhibitors; i.e. release of proteases affecting enzyme activity.
Since there were no logical trends to be deduced, the only significant finding from
the study is that the stimulation of NAD kinase with calcium was stable throughout
development in all three cases. This indicates that NAD is not synthesized or
degraded in the cell during development. This opens up a wide field of
speculations.
During the first 60 seconds after fertilization, NAD kinase is responsible for
converting about half the cell's NAD into NADP (Epel et al, 1981). What turns on
the enzyme is the transient rise in calcium occurring at fertilization. This initial
increase has been documented to last about 5 minutes but only the first minute has a
calcium level high enough to keep the enzyme active. The free intracellular calcium
rises from about 10Onm to 2uM (Poenie, 1985). This corresponds to the Cat
sensitivity curve of NAD kinase (Fig. 4)
There were some problems with trying to come up with the cutoff point for
turning on NAD kinase with calcium. The experiment had been carried out
previously and the crucial concentrations levels were reported to be between 10-7 M
