MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collecting Gametes
Gametes were collected from S. purpuratus by intracoelomic injection of
0.5 MKCl. Released eggs were stored in stirred sea water at 15'C. Sperm was
kept dry at 4'C. All gametes were used within 12 hours of collection. To dejelly
the eggs, the eggs were passed through a 90u Nitex mesh filter three times. The
dejellied eggs were resuspended in fresh sea water and then fertilized by adding a
small sample of sperm freshly dissolved in sea water.
Raising Embryos
Fertilized eggs were suspended in fresh sea water to a final concentration of
1% (vol/vol) and set up with a stirrer in a 15'C water bath. Three samples were
raised for 24 hours; a control group in sea water, one in 25ug/ml solution of
actinomycin in sea water. and one in 10-M emetine in sea water.
Extraction of Enzyme
At three hour intervals, 1Oml of each suspension were pelleted in a hand
centrifuge, washed several times with sea water and then resuspended to
5% (vol/vol) in an homogenization medium containing 300mM glycine/175mM
potassium gluconate/185mM mannitol/SOmM Pipes buffer/2OmM NaclSmM
MgC12/10mM EGTASmM DTT adjusted to pH of 6.8 using KOH. The mixture
was homogenized using a tight Dounce homogenizer until no intact cells were
visible under a microscope. (about 40 strokes) The samples were centrifuged at
20000g for five minutes at 4C and the supernatant was collected and kept at-40C
until the enzyme assay.
