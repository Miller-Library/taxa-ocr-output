FIGURE 1. Relative rate of NAD kinase activity as indicated by appearance of
NADPH in response to calcium during normal development. Each point represents
activity, in relative fluorescent units normalized to equivalent protein, of enzyme
activity in S. purpuratus embryos. Time points correspond to development as
follows; 0: unfertilized, 3: four-cell stage, 6,9,12: multi-cell stage, 18,21: blastula
FIGURE 2. Relative rate of NAD kinase activity in response to calcium during
development in actinomycin. Same conditions as Figure 1. Development also
corresponds to above.
FIGURE 3. Relative rate of NAD kinase activity in response to calcium during
development in emetine. Same conditions as Figure 1 and Figure 2. Development
was arrested at the one cell stage. Cells lysed at the 20th hour.
FIGURE 4. Calcium sensitivity curve for NAD kinase from fertilized eggs. Free
calcium concentrations as predicted by Patton's chelator program.
