Protein Assay
To standardize the amount of protein present in each sample, the Coomassie
blue filter paper assay was used. These values were used to normalize the relative
rates of activity found in the enzyme assay.
Measuring NAD Kinase Activity
The assay mixture consisted of 200mM Pipes buffer, 10mM MgCl, SmM
ATP, 1OmM G6P, 1.0 unit of G6PD, and 0.Iml of the enzyme extract. NAD was
added to 2mM concentration to begin the reaction. After a basal rate had been
established, a solution of calcium acetate was added to 0.SmM final concentration
to stimulate NAD Kinase to its maximal rate. Enzyme activity was measured using
a Perkins Elmer Fluorometer Model 204A at 340 mM excitation and 440mM
emission.
Calcium Sensitivity Assay
For this experiment, different amounts of calcium acetate were added during
the enzyme assay to vary the free calcium levels and observe their effects on NAD
kinase activity. The relationship between the total calcium and the free calcium
varied according to EGTA concentration, pH, temperature, and the presence of
other metal chelators. Chris Patton's chelating program was used to account for
these effects.
