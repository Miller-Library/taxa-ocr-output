NADP production by calcium. In the meantime, the released calcium could
stimulate other processes needed for the cell cycle. The role of NAD kinase would
then be to keep NADP levels constant in the cell.
Another interpretation of the stability of NAD kinase is to consider the tonic
nature of the enzyme. Most enzymes have half lives ranging from three minutes to
twenty-four hours (Bachmair et al, 1986). The finding that NAD kinase is not
degraded or resynthesized yet retains its activity upon calcium stimulation seems to
imply that it is remarkably stable. Sea urchins store their eggs up to six months
before spawning. For the egg to be constantly replacing an enzyme that is
necessary upon fertilization would be a waste of metabolic energy. Since NAD
kinase is such an enzyme, its stability could be a way of saving energy.
