ABSTRACT
The pleural ganglia of Doriopsilla albopunctata were mapped,
allowing for exploration into the effects of various neuroactive
substances on particular types of molluscan cells. Using a current
clamp, we studied those cells that demonstrated autorhythmic firing
characteristics - either beating or bursting. Two amines, Dopamine
and 5-Hydroxytryptamine, and one peptide, FMRF-amide, were applied
onto the ganglia, and the resulting gross voltage changes were recorded.
FMRF-amide and 5-HT were applied in combination, producing effects
unlike those when the chemicals were applied singly. Observed effects
range from membrane depolarization and hyperpolarization to changes in
synaptic input and input resistance. To decipher possible second
messenger systems underlying these changes, membrane permeable
CAMP analog (CPT-CAMP) and an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin,
were employed. We found that CAMP did not mimic the cellular
responses to these chemicals, nor did the forskolin produce the same
effect as the CAMP analog; clearly other second messenger systems are
being employed in both cases. Some voltage clamping was performed,
although many of the conclusions drawn concerning currents underlying
these changes are based on analogy with other molluscan systems.
