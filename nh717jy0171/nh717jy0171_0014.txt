threshold, if the Catt current were adequately reduced, the voltage
dependent, strong Nat channels will never be able to be activated, thus
inhibiting spikes. The observed depolarizing effects in the LP1 burster
can only be partially explained by suggesting that DA probably acts via
another cation channel to depolarize the cell, for it does decrease Catt
conductance. As with serotonin, DA's possible mechanisms are as
varied as are its effects.
Clearly, this pharmacological analysis of the D. albopunctata ganglia
is far from complete (Figure 11). It is, however, evidence for this
dorid's potential for electrophysiological study. Further elaboration
into these effects and unknown mechanisms of neuroactive substances
on this organism, using both current and voltage clamping techniques,
will open a new and exciting realm in neurological study that can only
fortify our understanding of cellular physiology.
