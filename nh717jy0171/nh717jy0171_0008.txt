state (Figure 6). Interburst hyperpolarizations were not smooth, rather
irregular with EPSP's, while sharp rises to spikes instead of gradual
depolarizations were observed.
Forskolin and Chlorophenylthio-CAMP (CPT-CAMP)
1o observe whether any of the applied neuroactive peptides or
amines exerted their effects via cAMP, we increased the intracellular
levels of CAMP by applying CPT-CAMP, a membrane permeable cyclic
AMP analog, and the diterpene forskolin, a known stimulator of CAMP
production in a variety of cells, including molluscan neurons (Coombs &
Thompson, 1987).
In cell LP1, forskolin inhibited bursting activity and initiated an
erratic beating pattern indicating much synaptic input (Figure 7). In
addition, doublet, triplets and trains of up to five spikes replaced the
single spikes in the original bursting condition. The effects of forskolin
were long lasting, being visible over an hour after application, even
though perfusing at a rate of 10cc per min. Input resistance
measurements reflect a drop from 7.OMQ to 5.25M0 upon application of
the diterpene. Voltage clamp was performed on the burster RP1 in the
opposite ganglion. Under these conditions, inward rectification was
found to decrease by a maximum of 39.3% at -60mV (Figure 8).
CPT-CAMP was then applied to LP1 without perfusion. Even after
30min, no effect on bursting activity or input resistance under current
