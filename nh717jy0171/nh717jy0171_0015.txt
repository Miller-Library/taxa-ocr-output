Figure 2. Various effects of FMRF-amide on two autorhythmic cells. A,
FMRF-amide causes inhibition of beating in LP2 . B, FMRF-amide induces
tonic spiking in LP1 burster.
Figure 3. Various cellular responses to 5-HT. A, 5-HT inhibits beating
activity in RP2. B, 5-HT depolarizes LP2 leading to increased spike
frequency.
Figure 4. 5-HT increases inward rectification in LP1 burster.
Figure 5. Depolarizing effects of 5-HT on cell RP4: Spike interval
measurements during three successive 5-HT applications. Dotted arrows
represent 60sec following application of 5-HT. Control spike interval is
3.5sec. #1, The first 5-HT application results in 0.5 sec spike interval.
42, The second application results in a 2.9 sec interval. #3, The third
and final application results in a 3.25 sec spike interval. Note: Different
time scales used in each measurement.
