concentrations were applied under voltage clamping conditions, and
indeed an increase in inward rectification was observed. No voltage
clamping of the cell after application of CPT-CAMP was performed, but
it would be appropriate to see if cAMP is responsible for the increase of
inward rectification. Finally, in the RP3 beater, we witnessed that the
depolarizing effect was reduced with successive 5-HT applications, the
cell apparently desensitizing itself to 5-HT. An increase in input
resistance accompanied the inactivation of the channels that caused the
initial gross changes; it seems each application decreased the number of
inward cation channels available to depolarize the cell. The observation
is not only interesting but also critical to experimental technique. It
demonstrates that although the gross effects of the substance may be
washed away and control conditions apparently returned, the subtle
effects underlying the observations may still affect data collection.
reinforcing the known complexity of mechanisms and receptor
properties that are responsible for our observations.
Of particular interest in studying the pharmacology of the
autorhythmic cells is the appearance of synaptic input, as was observed
after the co-application of 5-HT and FMRF-amide. The excitatory spurts
of activity could either be due to this cell's individual response to the
substances, to the cell presynaptic to it, or even a combination of the
two; elucidation of which it is is critical to our analysis for if bursting
behavior is not entirely endogenous to the cell, data collection will be
more complicated than expected. To test for synaptic input,
