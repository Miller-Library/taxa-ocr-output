hyperpolarizing current could be injected which would allow EPSP's to
be observed.
Application of forskolin also resulted in a great increase in synaptic
input in the LP1 burster in addition to a tonic spiking condition. One
effect of forskolin is its ability to depolarize the cell by closing
transient Kf currents, 1 (Coombs & Thompson, 1987). If this cell has
multiple axons each with its own spike initiating zone, the resulting
lower resting potential from the accumulation of internal Kt cations
may exceed the threshold of these zones, thus accounting for the
doublets, triplets, and trains of spikes observed. Voltage clamping
revealed a decrease in inward rectification, not surprising if carried by
KTions. As la is active at subthreshold voltages, its main effect is on
spike shape and rate of firing (Connor & Stevens, 1971; Byrne, 1980), as
observed. To complete this analysis, CPT-CAMP was applied under
voltage clamping conditions, and exhibited no change in inward
rectification. Thus it seems forskolin has its effect by a different
mechanism than cAMP, contrary to some findings (see Coombs &
Thompson, 1987).
Finally, dopamine exhibited the varied effects typical of a classic
neurotransmitter. In Aplysia R15, DA decreases subthreshold Catt
currents (Lewis et al, 1984), thus hyperpolarizing the cell. This
hyperpolarization stems from the fact that in nudibranchs, both Catt and
Naf constitute the upstroke of the action potential. As Catt currents
operate mainly at subthreshold voltages, determining if the cell reaches
