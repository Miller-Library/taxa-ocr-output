clamping conditions was observed. Voltage clamping under conditions
identical to that of forskolin resulted in a negligible change in inward
rectification (Figure 9). CPT-CAMP, then, does not seem to reproduce
the effects of forskolin.
Dopamine (DA)
Dopamine instantaneously inhibited all firing upon application to the
beating cell LP2 (Figure 10). The beating pattern did eventually recover.
initially firing at a slower rate and gradually returning to its original
condition.
The LP1 burster depolarized in response to DA, transforming its
bursting into a fast rate of repetitive firing. Tonic spiking activity
gradually slowed with an eventual resumption of the bursting pattern.
DISCUSSION
Individual neuropeptides and amines often exhibit varied effects on
different autorhythmic cells, even cells that display the same firing
pattern. Elucidation of the mechanisms of each particular observation
is difficult without appropriate voltage clamping experiments, but
general trends in other molluscan systems may prove analogous.
