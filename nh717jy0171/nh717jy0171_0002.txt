INTRODUCTION
Many studies aimed to model the electrophysiological properties of
neuroactive substances have been performed on molluscan nervous
systems. While much work has been performed on its larger relative
Aplysia californica here we present the feasibility of using the dorid
nudibranch, Doriopsilla albopunctata, for long-term
electrophysiological investigations.
Some of the cells in the D.albopunctata ganglia demonstrate
auforhythmic firing characteristics - either beating or bursting.
Beating cells are identified by repetitive firing at a constant regular
interval. Bursting, meanwhile, appears as a complex pattern involving
spike trains of increasing then decreasing frequency, and long
inter-burst hyperpolarizations. Indicative of the burst is the
depolarizing afterpotential, appearing as a bump after the last spike in
the burst. Bursting cells would often be observed in a beating phase,
when they would resemble a beater; we could differentiate between the
two, however, with knowledge of ganglia topography enabling individual
cell recognition, as well as by the symptomatic spike frequency
changes, and the appearance of slight bumps after the spikes typical of
a burster.
