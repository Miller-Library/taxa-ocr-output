often resulted in gross, observable changes in firing pattern under
current clamping situations. Two amines, 5-Hydroxytryptamine and
Dopamine, and one peptide, FMRF-amide, were applied and voltage
changes were recorded. To decipher possible second messenger systems
underlying the effects observed, membrane permeable CAMP as well as
an adenylate cyclase activator were employed. Dramatic effects such
as depolarization and hyperpolarization of the membrane, or subtle
changes like increased synaptic input or input resistance changes, were
among the types of responses seen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Doriopsilla albopunctata were collected subtidally from Monterey
Bay, CA., and stored in flowing natural sea water tanks of approximately
13Â°0. They were not fed, and were typically used within two weeks of
collection. Ganglia were dissected out and treated with neutral protease
(Dispase; Calbiochem.) for one hour, followed by a minimum two hour
rinse in ASW to facilitate the surgical removal of the epineural sheath.
Experiments were performed on the pleural ganglia pinned in a
Sylgard dish of approximately 5ml bath volume and perfused with ASW
of the following composition: 470mM Nacl, 10mM KCI, 10mM Cacl,
50mM MgCl, and 10mM Hepes (pH 7.8). Bath temperature during
