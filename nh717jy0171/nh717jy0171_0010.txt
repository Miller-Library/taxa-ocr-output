rectification (Thompson, 1988). If this were the case, one would expect
hyperpolarization of the membrane - thus, a probable explanation of
the observed inhibition in the beating LP2 cell. But we also observed a
depolarizing effect characterized by tonic spiking activity in both a
beater and a burster, RP3 and LP1. One possible explanation is a
decrease in inward rectification be responsible, or, more generally, the
opening of inward cation channels.
FMRF-amide's effect on cation channels in L4 and L6 bursting neurons
of Aplysia reveals its neurotransmitter/hormonal properties; it vields
a biphasic response in which it first activates an inward cation current
carried by Nat, then , after a longer latency activates an outward
current predominantly carried by Kt (Ruben, et al.,1986). The short
latency first observed between application and activation suggests that
the neurotransmitter binds directly to the receptor that gates the Nat
channels. The longer latency of the second response, meanwhile.
indicates that the compatible receptors are away from the site of
activation, implying a second messenger system. The particular
messenger which initiates this Kt response is uncertain; while
FMRF-amide is found to increase cAMP production in Aplysia gill tissue
(Weiss, et al., 1984), forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, causes
no change in the FMRF-amide response. It seems that a different second
messenger phosphorylates, thus activates, the channels; which
messenger is not clear. But perhaps the unexplained depolarizing
effects relate to the first phase of this biphasic response. If, in these
