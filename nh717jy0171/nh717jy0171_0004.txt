experiments was approximately 17Â°0.
Individual cells were impaled with two glass microelectrodes (R =
3-10M22) filled with 3M KCI solution. Basic current clamping protocol
was performed, in which one microelectrode injected a square current
pulse while the other measured the resulting voltage change,
Administration of long hyperpolarizing current pulses enabled us to
measure Tau and input resistance.
Several neuroactive peptides and amines were applied directly onto
the ganglia in dosages that, unless otherwise stated, resulted in a final
bath concentration of 2uM. Except where otherwise noted, perfusion
was not operating until after the initial gross effects of the applied
substances were observed. Perfusion continued at a rate of 1-10 cc per
min until the control condition was resumed.
Selected cells were then voltage clamped using two microelectrodes
similar to those used in the current clamp. One electrode maintained
the cell at a constant holding voltage of -40mV. From the holding
voltage, voltage was stepped from -90mV to -10mV in steps of +10mV.
each lasting 100ms with a 5sec interval between steps. The other
microelectrode measured the underlying current changes that resulted
from these steps.
