1.43nA at -90mV to .89nA at -60mV (Figure 4).
In the beating cell RP3, 5-HT application also induced a higher rate
of repetitive firing that attenuated with each successive application.
Spike interval was measured 60 seconds after administration of 5-HT in
three separate applications, perfusing between each (Figure 5).
Following the first application spike interval showed a dramatic drop
from a control of 3.5sec to 0.5sec, and thereafter a progressive increase
to 2.9sec and 3.25sec in applications two and three, respectively. Input
resistance measurements also showed a gradual increase from 12MQ to
21.3MO and 22.0MQ in applications one, two and three, respectively.
FMRF-amide and 5-HT
A 1:1 ratio of 5-HT and FMRF-amide applied during a 5-HT induced
tonic spiking condition in the LP1 burster resulted in an input
resistance drop greater than that of 5-HT alone. While 5-HT lowered
input resistance from 15.4MQ to 14.4MO, the input resistance dropped
to 10.2M2 with the combination. Tau also decreased from a control of
360.6ms to 354.3ms with 5-HT alone, then to a final value of 285.7ms
when combined with FMRF-amide.
Evidence for synaptic input effecting this cell's behavior was
observed after the application of this peptide-amine combination. Its
manifestation is in the form of instantaneous, excitatory spurts, which
increase spike frequency whether the cell be in a bursting or beating
