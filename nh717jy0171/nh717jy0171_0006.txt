FMRF-amide induced an instantaneous depolarizing effect in the LP1
burster (Figure 2). An input resistance drop from a control of 6.5MQ to
1.5M52 accompanied the observed tonic spiking condition. In the beating
LP2 cell, on the other hand, we observed complete inhibition of firing
upon the peptide application.
Disruption of beating pattern was observed in the rapidly firing RP3
beater; a constant control spike interval of 800ms fluctuated after
FMRF-amide application from 680ms to 960ms. From the appearance of
synaptic input during these intervals, we infer that cells presynaptic to
RP3 exhibit the FMRF-amide response consequently effecting RP3. AIl
FMRF-amide effects were reversible upon perfusion.
5-Hydroxytryptamine(5-HT)
Serotonin produced a delayed response in cell RP2, inhibiting its
beating pattern approximately 1.5min after application (Figure 3A). The
original firing pattern did eventually resume. Meanwhile, 5-HT caused a
depolarizing effect in the LP1 burster and the LP2 beater, exciting both
to a high rate of repetitive firing (Figure 3B). Voltage clamping of the
beater demonstrated an insignificant change in inward rectification,
although the spike interval decreased from 2.75-3.Osec to 1.36sec.
Clamping of the burster when exposed to a 5-HT bath concentration of
1OUM, however, revealed a marked increase in inward rectification of
