Many thanks to Stuart Thompson for his guidance and patience in
directing my arduous metamorphosis toward neurobiological competence,
Invaluable, too, has been the insight and assistance of Tony Morielli and
Brett Premack, and the moral support of dorid reaper Tom Otis. To my
partner Maggie, cheers. 1 wish you good moods and the very best of luck
always.
