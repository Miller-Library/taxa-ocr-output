Figure 6. Evidence for synaptic input in LP1 beater after application of
1:1 FMRF-amide and 5-HT. A,B, Bursts of increased frequency are
apparent during beating phase. CIrregular spike frequency within bursts
and sharp rises to spikes suggest synaptic input.
Figure 7. Multiple effects of forskolin on LP1. Forskolin induced
doublets, triplets, and quintuplets, with erratic firing pattern
characterized by much synaptic input.
Figure 8. Forskolin's effect on inward rectification.
Figure 9. CPT-CAMP shows negligible effects on inward rectification.
Unlike the plot of forskolin, this shows basically no change in inward
rectification.
Figure 10. Various cellular responses to DA. A, DA transforms RP1
bursting activity into a high rate of repetitive firing. B, DA inhibits
firing in LP2
