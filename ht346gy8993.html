TION
A major effect of grazing on the marine community was previous¬
ly found to be the selective elimination of foliose macrophytes
(Foreman, 1977). Grazing also appears to be an important factor in
controlling the overall abundance of algae in the high intertidal
community (Cubit, 1975) and in keeping rock surfaces free of lit¬
toral diatom populations (Castenholz, 1961). The purpose of this
study is to provide some information of the relationships between
herbivorous gastropod grazers and the epiphytic microalgae growing
on the fronds of the erect, red macroalga, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Rhodoglossum affine : Exact'>Rhodoglossum affine</span>
(Harv.) Kylin, in the rocky intertidal community.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
This study was conducted in the rocky intertidal zone near
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, within the research reserva¬
tion around the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in May.
1979 (illustration 1). Four 39 by 39 cm study areas were marked off
on two vertical rock faces in the mid zone of Rhodoglossum affine at
the same tidal height of 1.5 to 3.0 feet above mean low low water on
the shoreward faces of the rocks. Ninety-five percent of the area in
this zone was covered by R. affine, while the remaining 5 % consisted
of granite substrate and other erect red algae: <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gigartina papillata : Exact'>Gigartina papillata</span>

Inclusion and exclusion fences 3 inches high were made of resin

coated, 1/2 inch marine plywood boxes. They were fitted and bolted
to the granite substrate using lead anchors. The bottoms were seal¬
ed to the substrate with quick-drying cement and epoxy putty, and a
fine wire mesh 5 cm wide was nailed to the tops. One fence was placed
on each vertical face while the un-fenced study area which was 30 cm
to the right of each fenced area served as a field control.
The high snail density study area was created by placing the
following numbers of prosobranch gastropods in the algal holdfasts
in one fenced area twice each week: 200 <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tricolia pulloides : Exact'>Tricolia pulloides</span>
(Carpenter, 1865); 100 <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Barleeia haliotiphila : Exact'>Barleeia haliotiphila</span> (Carpenter, 1864);
and 25 <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula funebralis : Exact'>Tegula funebralis</span> (A. Adams, 1855). These snails were col¬
lected from different areas and kept in aquariums a few days before
their addition. The low snail density study area was created by re¬
moving all gastropods and other grazers which were found while exam¬
ining the algal holdfasts, the algal fronds, and the granite sub¬
strate within the other fenced area once each week. Four to five
randomly selected fronds were collected from all four areas each
week. The top portion of the frond above the second branching was
removed and the remaining area was scored under a dissecting micro¬
scope at 30X magnification for the percentage of area which was cov¬
ered by grazing tracks and by epiphytes. The vertical distribution
of these tracks and epiphytes was also recorded. Student t-tests
were computed to compare the means of the total number of fronds
collected from each area on weeks 1, 2, and 3 1/2.

On the day of the last collection, snail densities of each study
area were determined by removing the algae in 10 randomly selected
16 cm" areas in each study area. Densities were determined by the
number of snails per gm of dry weight of algae dried at 60* cen¬
tigrade for 12 hours.
The epiphytes were identified by Dr. I. A. Abbott. Grazing
tracks were identified at 30X magnification under a dissecting mi-
croscope by comparisions with known grazing tracks made on pieces of
Rhodoglossum affine by herbivorous gastropods kept in the lab.
RESULT
As figure 1 indicates, the largest percentage of frond area
examined was covered by the green alga, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endophyton : Exact'>Endophyton,</span> which grows
into the cuticle and cortex of the fronds, and by dense growths of
pennate diatoms which seemed to be imbedded in the cuticle. Pennate
diatoms were also found in other areas under the compound micro¬
scope, but only the dense growths (illustration 2) were clearly
visible as shiny specks under the dissecting microscope. Covering
a much smaller percentage of frond area examined were: the green
algae, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pseudodictyon : Exact'>Pseudodictyon</span> sp. and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Enteromorpha : Exact'>Enteromorpha</span> sp.; blue-green algae
growing in cocoid clusters; a filamentous red alga, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acrochaetium : Exact'>Acrochaetium</span> sp.;
a small coralline red alga; and centric diatoms. As figure 2 illus¬
trates, Endophyton was found mainly low on the fronds while the
dense pennate diatom growths were found mainly on the upper portions
of the frond area examined.

The types of grazing tracks which were identified on the fronds
were the clusters of dots made by either Tricolia pulloides or Bar¬
leeia haliotiphila, and the larger, thin, and somewhat sickle-shaped
tracks made by Tegula funebralis or <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula brunnea : Exact'>Tegula brunnea</span> (Phillippi, 1848)
(illustration 3). Figure 2 shows that grazing tracks made by <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. pul-
loides</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. haliotiphila</span> were found mainly high on the frond area
examined while grazing tracks made by <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula : Exact'>Tegula</span> sp. were found all over.
In the area where the grazers were removed, the percentage of
frond area examined bearing Tricolia pulloides and Barleeia halio-
tiphila grazing tracks was significantly lower than its field con-
trol (fig. 3), while the percentage of frond area examined which
was densely covered by diatoms was significantly higher than its
field control (fig. 4). Figure 5 shows that when compared to its
field control, this same area had no significant change in the per¬
centage of frond area which was covered by other epiphytes during
this time period.
The relationship of Barleeia haliotiphila and Tricolia pulloides
grazing tracks with the dense pennate diatom growths is shown in
figure 6 where the study area with a high percentage of T. pulloides
and B. haliotiphila grazing tracks had a low percentage of dense pen-
nate diatom cover, while the area with a low percentage of B. halio-
tiphila and T. pulloides grazing tracks had a correspondingly high
percentage of dense diatom cover.
Figure 7 shows that the study area where the snails were re¬
moved did have a significantly lower density of Tricolia pulloides
-6-

and Barleeia haliotiphila than its field control, and that the study
area where the snails were added did have a significantly higher T.
pulloides and B. haliotiphila density than its field control. Fig-
ure 7 also shows that the percentage of frond area bearing B.
haliotiphila and T. pulloides grazing tracks increases with snail
density while the percentage of frond area covered by a dense growth
of pennate diatoms decreases. This relationship between snail den¬
sity and percentage of frond area densely covered by pennate diatoms
is plotted in figure 8. These points best fits a power function
showing an inverse relationship between B. haliotiphila and T. pul-
loides density and the percentage of frond area covered by a dense
pennate diatom growth.

DIS(
CUSSION
The positive relationship between snail density and percentage
of frond area examined bearing Barleeia haliotiphila and Tricolia
pulloides grazing tracks indicates that grazing pressure was de-
creased in the study area where the snails were taken out. The in¬
verse relationship between grazer density and the percentage of frond
area densely covered by pennate diatoms further suggests that this
decreased grazing pressure of B. haliotiphila and T. pulloides had
a positive effect on the percentage of frond area densely covered by
pennate diatoms. The hypothesis that high T. pulloides and B. halio-
tiphila densities reduces diatom populations is further supported by
the finding that both T. pulloides and B. haliotiphila grazing tracks
Stephen A. Chun
-7-
and these dense pennate diatom populations were found mainly on the
upper portions of the frond area which was examined (fig. 2). At
the same time of this study, Mooers (1979) found that pennate diatoms
make up 90 - 95 % of the diet of T. pulloides, and Foster (1979)
found tha T. pulloides will move to the upper portions of algal
fronds under optimum conditions. All of these findings seem to
support the hypothesis that the grazing of T. pulloides and B. halio-
tiphila reduces the percentage of frond area covered by a dense growth
of pennate diatoms and suggests that T. pulloides moves out to the
upper portions of the fronds because that is where its major food
source is very abundant.

ABSTRACT
Grazing pressure on the epiphytes on the fronds of the inter¬
tidal red alga, Rhodoglossum affine, was manipulated by adding and
removing herbivorous gastropods. The green alga, Endophyton, and
dense pennate diatom populations were found to be the most abundant
epiphytes in percentage of frond area covered. The primary grazers
were found to be the prosobranch gastropods, Tricolia pulloides,
Barleeia haliotiphila, Tegula funebralis, and Tegula brunnea.
Grazing by T. pulloides and B. haliotiphila was found to reduce the
percentage of frond area covered by dense growths of pennate diatoms.
