lowering the interior temperature. As indicated by the data (Table I)
the average number of successful attempts was 6,and the average
temperature drop found to be 0.5 0. P.samuelis vacated the shell
either due to high temperature, or because the probe was inhibiting
complete withdrawal into the shell.
P.granosimanus appears to lack a behavioral control of shell
temperature, for only 5 out of 10 crabs made one successful attempt
at lowering the temperature. Osually its "walking-withdrawal" response
increased the temperature. The shell vacating tendency also seemed
absent, as 9/10 of the crabs hung half out of the shell in an apparent
narcotized state at about 29.0°0., which interestingly is olose to
their lethal water temperature.
Body temperature experiments revealed some interesting trends.
As expected of poikilotherms both species' normal body temperatures
(Table II)were only slightly higher than the surrounding water
temperature. When exposed without their shells, the time till death
was the same for both species, 45-65 minutes (Table III). The body
temperatures at death seemed dependent on exposure conditions, as
the second day's values were higher than the first. But generally
the mean body temperaturés of P.samuelis are higher than those of
P.granosimanus.
Body temperatures at death within the shell (Table IV) again depend
on exposure conditions with the second days' results being higher than
the first. Contrary to results without the shell, P.granosimanus
generally has a mean temperature higher than P.samuelis. The times
till death for P.granosimanus ranged from 65 to 90 minutes, while
those for P.samuelis were from 65 to 220 minutes. This indicated o
the shell acts as a protective agent against exposure.
