The death rates plotted in figure 1 and 2 show P. samuelis can
tolerate high water temperatures better than P. granosimanus.
More exadt temperature levels indicated the lethal temperature
for P.granosimanus to be 29.7°0. and P.samuelis, 31.5°0.. Although
during an inconclusive survey of exposed tidepools, the highest
temperature I observed was 29.0°0., I feel higher values could be
reached for short periods during a low tide on a very hot day. Thus
if P.granosimanus were exposed one hour to 31°0. they would begin
dying, and one hour exposure to 32.9°0. would begin killing P.samuelis.
Since the two species live in an intertidal region, some ability
to withstand exposure out of water is necessary. The shell temperature
experiments (Table I and figure 3) were conducted under the most
extreme field conditions, for crabs are rarely found exposed on dry
sand, but rather are under rocks or nestled in the algae; however,
the results jemonstrate ability to live under these conditions.
Although not indicated by my data, shell temperatures appear to
depend on the degree of sun exposure, for a passing cloud rapidly
lowered the temperature two to three degrees, while its disappearance
increased the temperature.
The representative graph (Figure 3) shows P, samuelis more active
and better able to control shell temperature for a longer time, almost
double that of P.granosimanus. A successful attempt at control was
considered any act by the crab which lowered shell temperature. The
surprising observation was the apparent behavioral response of
P samuelis to control its increased shell temperature. The crab
would come partially out of the shell, begin walking,as if airing
the shell's interior, and then withdraw deep into the shell, thereby
