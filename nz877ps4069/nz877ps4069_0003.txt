Shell temperatures were investigated by exposing crabs out of
water to bright sun light between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. Since most
P. samuelis and P,granosimanus occupy Tegula funebralis (A. Adams
1854) shells (Bollay, 1964), only these were used. A 3/16 inch hole
was drilled in the upper most portion of the shell,and a small (1.5mm.
temperature sensitive probe inserted. Temperatures were measured on
a YSl Model 43 Single Channel Tele-thermometer. The crabs were placed
in a plastic dish, whose bottom was covered by sand. Readings were
taken every minute until the animal either vacated the shell or
became completely inactive.
To study normal body temperatures of each species I inserted
the probe, used in the shell temperature experiment, into the thorax
of animals(ut in half)and read temperatures on the Tele-Thermometer.
Using essentially the same procedure, I determined body temperatures
at death from exposure. Equal numbers of each species both in and
out of the shell were again exposed in plastic dishes whose bottom
was covered by sand. The time till death for each animal was recorded,
and species behavior observed. At death the animals were cut in half.
and the probe inserted into their thorax.
Desiccation experiments were begun by comparing rates of water
loss when exposed to bright sunlight in open plastic dishes. I
used five crabs of each species both in the shell and out; their
total weights were taken every 15 minutes. Weight loss was attributed
to water loss and computed as weight loss per unit of original body
weight.
Since different rates of water loss were observed, I next tested
the amount of desiccation tolerated by each species before death.
Each crab was removed from its shell, weighed and placed in
