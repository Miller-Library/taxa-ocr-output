individual 50 ml. glass beakers within a desiccator, whose atmosphere
was kept dry by caleium chloride. The time till death and weight
at death were recorded. The weight loss was attributed to water
loss and calculated as percent of original body weight. Tabulations
of results within species were divided into three groups, females,
gravid females and males.
Since similar hermit crabs are isotonic to normal and slightly
concentrated sea water (Prosser, 1950, p.24) possibly they might
die in sea water from which was removed that peroent of water they
lost at death. Therefore I weighed and placed four orabs of each
species in 1.5X sea water which I prepared by removing 38% of its
original water. The number alive and total crab weights were recorded
after 24 and 41 hours.
Their failure to die within the concentrated sea water indicates
their bodies can withstand higher salt concentrations and suggests
that possibly drying of the gills could cause jeath in the desiccator.
Therefore five orabs of each speices were placed in the desiccater,
and at 2 hour intervala 0.02 cc. sea water was injected onto their
gills by a 1/4 co. Tuberculin syringe. The time till death was recorded
and compared with that for normal death by desiccation.
Another possible cause of death during desiccation may be
waste product accumulation, which cannot be removed in the absence
of excess water. This was tested by placing three crabs of each
species (in their shells) within individual air tight jars containing
wet toweling (thereby keeping the atmosphere saturated and preventing
desiccation). The toweling was remoistened with sea water every
10 hours, the weight of the crabs taken originally, after 24 and
41 hours, and number dead recorded at these times.
