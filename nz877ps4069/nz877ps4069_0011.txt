Summary
1. fests were performed on P.samuelis and P.granosimanus to
deterwine the effects of temperature and desiccation.
2. F.sanwelis can tolerate higher water temperature than P.Kranosinanus
with P. sammelis lethal temperature at 31.500. ani E.granosimanus 29.700
3. Shell temperature measurements on exposure to sunlight showed t at
P.Samuelis maiatained a lower shell temperature longer an' possessed
an a parent behavioral response for controlling temperature. (In
response to increase temperature the animal woul' ap arently air
the shell by walking and then withiraw deep into its interior, thereby
lowering the shell temperature.)
4. Both species ile at 45-65 minutes out of the shell when exposed to
the sun with P.samuelis body temperature at death higher than P.
granosiranus.
5. When exposed within the shell P.samuelis livei longer and ha
a lower body temperature at jeath than P.granosimanus.
6. Pisamuelis loses more water and faster than P.granosimanus both
in and out of the shell, but t e former can lose about 27.06 (nean
value) of its body weiwht as water before death, the latter oily
18.36 (mean value). In both species rales can tolerate the least
loss, then females; females with egges tolerate the greatest loss.
7. Generally P.samuelis is a'apted to a higher position in the
intertidal zone due to its ability to withstan' an' control temperature.
