water should decrease osmotically, and likewise their weight. Table VII
disproves these assumptions, for the animals did not die and did
gain weight. This suggests that the maintenance of a constant amount
of internal water balances the increased salt concentration. (Also
the denser sea water makes the animals weigh more.)
The results in Table VIII show that neither specles remains alive
if only its gills are moistened. Normally P.granosimanus died from
6-11 hours after being placed in the desiccator and P.samuelis 7-134
hours. The hours till death when I moistened their gills show that
both species die within the normal death time. Thus the cause of
death during desiccation is questionable. Gill drying appears not to
be the cause, but since the crabs seem to adjust to more concentrated
sea water, body water loss may be the primary mortality factor.
The data in Table IX rule out the possibility of waste product
accumulation causing death, for only one P.granosimanus died after
A mata,
41 hours, Tais time is much longer than the normal time interval
observed for mortality within the desiccator. P.samuelis il and /3
and P.granosimanus 1 and 2 seem to lose weight after 24 hours
probably because of initial weighing inaccuracies due to water held
within the shell.
