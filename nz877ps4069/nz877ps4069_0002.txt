Introduction
A crude survey of the hermit crab population indicated a
marked lifference in the intertilal areas occupied by Pagurus
samuelis (Stimpson, 1857) and Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859).
It has since been determine by concurrent work of R. Belknap and
John Markham that P.samuelis ranges from O.3 to 1.3 feet intertidally
and P. granosimanus from -.6 to .55 feet. Melody Bollay (1964)
demonstrated that P. samuelis coul withstand gross exposure longer
than P. granosimanus. This suggests that desiccation and temperature
tolerance may be limiting species distribution, and it is these
physical factors which I investigated.
Metod
The hermit crabs were obtained intertidally at Hopkins Marine
Station and kept alive in aquariums supplied with running sea water.
Only adult crabs as jescribed by Schmitt (1921) were used. The two
species were first tested to determine water temperature tolerance
and their lethal water temperature (taken as that temperature at
which 508 of the crabs can live indefinitely). Twenty five crabs of
each species were placed in plastic dishes, to prevent random mixing.
in an aquarium. Using a Precision Thermo-Regulator the 14Â°0. sea
water was heated to the jesired temperature in order to simulated
the slow heating occuring in exposed tidepools. At intervals of 1.
4, and 8 hours after reaching this temperature the number of crabs
alive was recorled. Air was pumped into the aquarium causing water
circulation, thereby preventing stratification of heated water.
