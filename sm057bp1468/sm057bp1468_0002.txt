MATING BEHAVIOR
The present study was carried out with B. glandula
and B. tintinnabulum maintained in laboratory aquaria provided
with flowing sea-water at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, during
April and May, 1967. The B. glandula used were collected on
mussel shells at Mussel Point and from pilings under
Fishermen's Wharf at Monterey, California. B. tintinnabulum
were taken from the underside of a float anchored off. the
Hopkins Marine Station. A few observations of copulation were
made on B. glandula growing on intertidal rocks on Mussel Point
heach during high tides on April 20 - 21, 1967.
TINNABULUM
BALANU
In B. tintinnabulum the penis is usually kept coiled
against the side of the body within the mantle cavity, and
during feeding, though the cirral net is generally fully
extended, no part of the penis is exposed to an observer.
Extrusion of the penis is co-ordinated with the extension of
the cirral net. During copulatory beating of the cirri, shown
in figure 1, B-D, the penis is slowly raised and uncoiled.
At the final beat the appendage is completely unrolled, as
in figure 1, E. When the penis is fully extended all the cirri
are also held rigidly extended and motionless. Retraction
of the penis is a fast, whipping motion accompanied by the
withdrawal of the cirral net.
The participants in mating, while hermaphroditic.
may be separated into donors, acting as males, and receivers,
acting as females. Pre-copulatory behavior begins with an
increase of activity on the part of the prospective donors
and a decrease in activity in the potential receiver. The
rate of cirral beat of donors varies from 1.5 to 3 times that
of a non-copulating, feeding barnacle. Receivers usually stop
feeding and remain with the operculum raised and opened and
the cirri pumping within the shell. If startled into closing
