the donor's penis after insertion. One to four donors simultaneously
in copula with the same receiver has been observed in B. glandula;
this has also been noted in B. balanoides by Barnes and Barnes
(1956). In B. glandula matings where a single donor was involved,
dissection of the donor after copulation showed that all the
sperm in the seminal vesicles was spent. Where there was more
than one donor, the seminal vesicles of each donor were still
partially full after mating. This suggests that the receiver
accepts only a certain amount of sperm. Crisp (1954) noted
that in B. balanoides extra sperm was ejected from the mantle
cavity of the receivers. In B. glandula, as in B. tintinnabulum,
most donors carried ovigerous lamellae, and receivers which
were opened after mating were observed to be passing unfertilized
eggs into the elastic sacs.
Copulation of B. glandula in the field was observed
once, on a rock which was gently washed by incoming waves.
The behavior was basically the same as that observed in the
aquarium except that the cirri were extended each time a wave
covered the rock, and the penis was uncoiled only when the
water was flowing in the direction of the receiver. The potential
donors were extremely active, exhibiting pumping action even
during moments when the rock was not covered. The receiver
also remained with the operculum open when exposed between
waves. Several times after the penis had been positioned
through the operculum of the receiver, waves washed it loose
and left it hanging down the side of its own shell. Even
under these conditions several nearby donors responded to
the receiver. During low tide, when the organisms were not
washed or submerged by the water, no activity was observed.

Since in both B. glandula and B. tintinnabulum,
animals engaging in exploration or probing with the penis
were always found to possess seminal vesicles bulging with
sperm, this appears to be a necessary condition for a donor.
