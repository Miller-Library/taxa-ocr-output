A. Won
the penis is flooded with sperm which is clearly visible
externally as a crooked white line in the organ. Pinching
of the penis by the receiver's operculum may serve the dual
purpose of holding the organ in place during the deposition
of sperm and triggering the expulsion of sperm. It has been
noticed in dissections of barnacles that sometimes a pinching
of the penis with forceps may cause ejection of sperm. However,
experimental pinching of the extended penis in exploring animals
with fine forceps failed to cause ejection in repeated trials.
Insemination takes about 1 to 2 minutes, after which
the penis, still filled with sperm, is released and withdrawn,
leaving a trjal of sperm in the water. The donor resumes feeding,
and the receiver closes its operculum, rocking and rotating it.
Though several prospective donors may respond to,
and probe toward, a given receiver, only one donor copulates
with a receiver in B. tintinnabulum. Barnacles acting the
roles of donor and receiver simultaneously were never observed.
All potential donors which were opened before insemination
had occured possessed bulging seminal vesicles filled with
sperm, while potential receivers always had an abundance of
unfertilized, late ovarian eggs. After copulation, donors
usually still retained some sperm in their seminal vesicles.
Receivers which were opened about 10 minutes after insemination
were always observed passing ripe ova into the elastic sacs.
Usually, potential and actual donors were found to be brooding
ovigerous lamellae, although a few were found with only.early
ovarian eggs; none were seen bearing ripe ova. In the receivers,
the seminal vesicles were found to range from empty to bulging
full of sperm.
BALANUS GLANDULA
Mating behavior in B. glandula was observed to be
very similar to that of B. tintinnabulum except for the
following points. B. glandula does not have a rotatable,
beaked operculum and hance the receiver cannot actively position
