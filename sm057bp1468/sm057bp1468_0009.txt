3) Activity of the donor can be divided into three phases:
exploration, probing, and insemination.
4) Exploratory activity consists of an apparently aimless
waving of the penis in the water. Probing action of the
penis, which often follows a period of exploration, is
directed toward a particular receiver, suggesting secretion
by the latter of some stimulating substance.
5) Probing terminates with insertion of the organ into the
mantle cavity of the receiver. During insemination, pinching
of the donor's penis by the opercular valves of the receiver
holds the organ in place, and perhaps acts as a trigger
which sets off sperm ejection by the donor.
Prospective donors always has seminal vesicles bulging
with sperm while receptive barnacles always possessed large
numbers of unfertilized, ripe ova.
7) Immediately after insemination has occured, ovarian eggs
are passed into the elastic sacs, which protrude into the
mantle cavity.
The maximum reach of B. glandula with a basal diameter of
8 mm or more is 6 cm; for C. dalli of basal diameter 1-2 mm,
the maximum reach appears to be about 25 mm.
9) B. glandula and C. dalli probably do not self-fertilize,
at least during April and May.
