their neighbours had any ovigerous lamellae, it appears that
self-fertilization does not occur in B. glandula, at least
at this time of year, despite the simultaneous maturation of
male and female gonads.
In studies on C. dalli, distances from the nearest neighbour
were measured in the same way as on B. glandula. Individuals
with a maximum basal width of 1-2 mm (at which size they are
sexually mature) were collected and checked for the presence
of ovigerous lamellae under the dissecting microscope. The
results, expressed in the same manner as for B. glandula, are
presented in figure 4. Animals 1-20 mm from their nearest
neighbour show a relatively high and constant percentage of
fertilization. A significant drop occurs between 20 and 25 mm,
and animals more than 26 mm from other C. dalli bore no ovigerous
lamellae. It appears the C. dalli can extend its penis to
reach another animal separated from it by a distance equal to
at least 12 times the basal diameter of the shell. It also
seems probable that C. dalli does not self-fertilize, at least
at this season.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I wish to thank Dr. D. P. Abbott for his advice and
help throughout the research and in the writing of this paper,
and all fellow students of the 1967 class of 175h at Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California
for encouragement and use of specimens.
SUMMARY
1) During copulatory activity, functional male barnacles (donors)
are much more active than functional females (receivers).
The rate of cirral beat when the penis is partially extended
is 1.5 to 3 times faster than that in normal feeding animals
under the same conditions. When the penis is completely
extended, the cirral net remains outstretched and motionless.
