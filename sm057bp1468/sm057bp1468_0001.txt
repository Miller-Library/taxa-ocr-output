INTRODUCTION
Mating in barnacles involves the transfer of sperm
via the penis from one animal to the mantle cavity of another.
The penis of a barnacle is a highly extensible and muscular
appendage arising medially between the most posterior cirri.
It may bear sensory setae at the tip (Crisp, 1954). Some
details of mating in Balanus balanoides have been reported
by Barnes and Barnes (1956) and Clegg (1957), and in B. porcatus
by Crisp (1954). There has not been a detailed description
of the process in most other species of acorn barnacles, and
there has been no account of the actual process of insemination
in any barnacle.
While cross-fertilization appears to be the general
rule in barnacles, and is obligatory in B. crenatus, B. modestus,
B. balanoides and Pollicipes polymerus according to Crisp (1954),
Crisp and Patel (1960), and Hilgard (1960), it has been shown
by Barnes and Crisp (1956) that self-fertilization can occur
in Chthamalus stellatus, Verruca stroemia and B. perforatus.
The present study is concerned with describing
copulatory activity and the reproductive states of the participants
in Balanus glandula Darwin, 1854 and Balanus tintinnabulum
(Linnaeus, 1758), and wo investigat the maximum reach of the
penis and the possibility of self-fertilization in B. glandula
and Chthamalus dalli Pilsbry, 1919.
