MAXIMUM MATING DISTANCES AND SELF FERTILIZATION

To determine the maximum distance over which copulation.
in B. glandula and C. dalli, specimens of both species isolated
by different distances from their nearest neighbours were
collected at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California on rocks
approximately two feet above tidal datum during May and early
June, 1967.
A preliminary survey of B. glandula in close proximity
to one another was carried out to ensure that animals, of the
sizes to be sampled were sexually mature as evidenced by the
presence of ovigerous lamellae. Specimens with maximum basal
diameters of 6.0 + 14 mm were checked for the presence of
ovigerous lamellae. The results are presented below.

The data presented indicate little difference in frequency
of occurence of lamellae in animals of the size range shown.
All of the B. glandula subsequently collected had basal diameters
of 8 mm or more and are very likely to have reached sexual
maturity.
In the field, distance to nearest neighbour was
measured in terms of the shortest distance between the rims
of the opercula of the two animals before removal from the
substrate. In the laboratory, each individual was checked
for the presence of ovigerous lamellae. The data are plotted
in figure 3. None of the individuals separated by 7 cm or
more from their nearest neighbours carried ovigerous lamellae,
and less than 10% of the individuals 3-6 cm away from the
closest neighbour showed evidence of fertilization.
The above results suggests that the maximum reach
of B. glandula donors with a basal diameter of 8 mm or greater
was 6 cm. Since no barnacles isolated by more than 6 cm from
