INTRODUCTION
The copepod Tigriopus californicus is frequently abundant in high
tide pools that have a black sediment and smell of hydrogen sulfide.
The sulfide results from the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter,
primarily pieces of macroscopic algae, brought to these pools by tidal
action. It would appear that oxygen becomes limiting in these isolated
marine enviroments due to aerobic decomposition of the same algal ma¬
terial, and the process of sulfate reduction by Desulfovibrio sp.be¬
comes conspicuous. The process of aerobic and anaerobic decomposition
affect these enviroments and may in turn have an effect upon other
inhabitants such as T. californicus. This study includes a field sur¬
vey of sulphide concentrations found in tide pools of the Central Cal¬
ifornia coastal area, laboratory toxicity studies carried out using
T. californicus, and an investigation of the relationships between
water depth and sediment depth and their affects on oxygen depletion
and sulfide generation during the breakdown of the alga, Macrocystis
pyrifera.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In the general field survey the area of study was the high tide
pools on the Montery penninsula from Mussel Pt. to Asilomar State Beach.
Oxygen was measured using a standard Winkler titration (Carritt and
Carpenter 1966). Ten milliter samples were drawn off the bottom of
the pool just above the sediment with a pipett covered with plankton
screening. Great care was exercised in making sure no bottom sediment
that might adhere to the screening was washed into the collecting flasks.
Samples were placed in 25ml Erlenmeyer flasks and "pickled" immediately
with analysis completed within two hours. Sulphide was measured using
