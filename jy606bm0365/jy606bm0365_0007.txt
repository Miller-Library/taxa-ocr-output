of these bacteria is shown in figure 1 where anoxic sediment is required
for oxygen depletion. This model explains the effects of different
sediment depths. In deeper sediment more of the diffusable nutrients
would be trapped inside the sediment for use by the sulphate reducing
bacteria. As the population of the sulphate reducers increases they
would us an increasing proportion of the diffusably nutrients letting
correspondingly less material reach the aerobic respiring organisms.
As fewer nutrients reach the aerobes their oxygen demands decrease which
results in increasing oxygen in the water column. This effect is easily
seen in figure 3.
Neither of these chemical changes results in a deleterious affect
on the enviroment from a chemical point of view. Sulphide never reaches
high enough levels to endanger T. californicus. The only possible dele¬
terious effect to T. californicus is the decrease in oxygen near the
sediment surface. However, T. californicus can swim to less anoxic water
higher in the column. These chemical changes maybe of greater signifi¬
cance in leading to the conversion of macroscopic algae into a form
that can be more readily utilized by organisms such as T. californicus
which can graze upon the rich microbial flora associated with the organic
decay process.
ABSTRACT
The aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in high
tide pools and the effects of these processes on Tigriopus californicus
was investigated. Changes in dissolved oxygen and sulphide were measured
in model prepartions in the laboratory and compared to field measurements.
Macrocystis pyrifera was the organic matter used in the study. Water
column height and sediment depth were varied to obtain an estimate of
