studied; 1.5cm, 0.5cm, and Ocm sediment. Macrocystis was supplied as
circular pieces approximately 2cm in diameter, and weighing approximately
I gram. The algal pieces were buried beneath the sediment. To further
duplicate conditions in tide pools 10-20 T. californicus were added to
each tube.
Five replicates were prepared for each set of measurements, thus
permitting the daily measurements on undisturbed preparations. Oxygen
and sulphide were measured as described above. In addition dissolved
interstitial sulphide was determined after thoroughly mixing the sediÂ¬
ment with the water remaining after samples were taken for oxygen and
sulphide in the overlying water. During the period of the measurements
the tubes were left open to the air at room temperature in the laboratory.
Insoluble sulphide was determined after acidification with 3N HCl.
RESULT!
Table I shows the oxygen, sulphide, and pH levels encountered in
the survey of high tide pools. The highest sulphide level observed was
352 ug/liter. Results from the toxicity studies indicated a minimum
lethal dose of 3.0x10 'M sulphide. This concentration corresponds to
10,200ug/liter or thirty times the highest concentration found in the
field. Under natural conditions sulphide does not appear to reach
levels toxic to T. californicus. However, the isolated tidepools of the
high intertidal may be affected in a variety of ways by the periodic
input of organic matter in the form of drift algae. Therefore,
laboratory simulations were studied in order to elucidate the time course
of events including changes in oxygen and sulfide. Two variables
appeared most worthy of investigation, ie. depth of sediment and height
of water column.
