the effect of these two variables on aerobic and anaerobic processes.
The effects of changing water column with showed an inverse rela¬
tionship where oxygen decreased and sulfide increase as the column height
has decreased. The effects of changeng sediment depth showed a direct
relationship where oxygen and sulphide levels both increased as sediment
depth was increased.
The amounts of sulphide in the high tide pools in the field reached
levels of 352ug/liter, approximately 1/30 the lethal dose for T. californicus.
The importance of this decomposition process to T. californicus is dis¬
cussed.
