the colorimetric method described by Strickland and Parsons (Strickland
and Parsons 1968). Sulphide samples were collected using a large vol¬
ume turkey baster that was covered with plankton screening. Once
again care was exercised in not letting any sediment get in the sample
container. Samples were stored in 30ml glass stoppered reagent bottles
that were filled to overflowing then stoppered without the inclusion
of a bubble of air. Analyses were completed within two hours. pH read¬
ings were taken from the glass stoppered reagent bottles used for sulphide
analysis. pH was measured using a Beckman Zeromatic II pH meter.
Toxicity studies were carried out using five sulphide concentra¬
tions; 2.5x10-4, 3.Ox10-“, 3.6x10-4, 4.3x10-“, and 5.2x10 M. Solutions
were made using filtered seawater and reagent grade Sodium Sulfide and
placed in 30ml glass stoppered reagent bottles. Ten animals were added
to each bottle. The bottles were filled to the top and stoppered
without the inclusion of air. Animals are unaffected by such confinement
in plain filtered sea water for periods in excess of one week. Mor-
tality was determined and defined as a total lack of movement, even
upon shaking.
Models of high tide pools were simulated in the laboratory using
large 30 x 2.8cm test tubes. Two variables, height of the water colum
and depth of sediment were varied while the amount of organic matter was
held constant at approximately one gram of Macrocystis. The three
water levels tested were 25cm, 15cm, and 5cm. Water height was measured
as the distance from the top of the sediment to the top of the water
column. Unfiltered seawater from the Hopkins Marine Station seawater
system was used. Sediment consisted of coarse beach sand. The sand
was washed several times in fresh water to remove organic matter and
dried at 60° for one and a half days. Three sediment depths were
