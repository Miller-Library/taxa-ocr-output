accompanied by significantly higher sulphide levels than those seen in
0.5cm sediment preparations. In the shallower sediment oxygen levels
go below lml/liter on days four and five while sulphide never gets
above 64 ug/liter in the interstitial enviroment.
Table 2 shows the relative percentages in distribution of sulphide
in a water column with the vast majority of sulphide stored as insoluble
metallic sulphidesdeposited in the sediment. There is also noticeably
more sulphide in the interstitial enviroment in tubes with deeper
sediment and less dissolved sulphide in the water column. The total
sulphide production in these two simulations is approximately the same.
DISCUSSION
Chemical changes in the simulations suggest the participation
of three microbial populations invilved in the decomposition of organic
matter. First a group of anaerobic organisms appear to be involved in
the initial breakdown of large polysaccharides in the algal material.
This group of microorganisms may also partially oxidize the carbohydrates
released by the digestive action. As these more readily utilizable mater¬
ials diffuse from the site of deposition of the algae they become availible
to the next group, the anaerobic sulfate reducers dependent upon anaerobic
conditions within the sediment. The presence of these organisms is in¬
dicated by the production of hydrogen sulphide. Those materials not
utilized by the sulphate reducers diffuse into the water column where the
final group of bacteria, the aerobic respiring microorganisms oxidize
the nutrients at the expense of dissolved oxygen. Within the time
period studied this appears to be dependent on the existence of the
initial anaerobic digestive bacteria. The evidence for the importance
