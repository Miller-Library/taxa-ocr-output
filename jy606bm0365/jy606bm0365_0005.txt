Figure I shows the results obtained using a water column of 15cm
and three sediment depths; 1.5, 0.5, and Ocm. Looking at figure 1, one
sees significantly lower oxygen levels in tubes with sediment while
dissolved oxygen in tubes without sediment seem to reach a higher steady
state level due to a balance between diffusion and utilization. Between
the two sediment levels ther is a significant difference in dissolved
oxygen. After fourdays the dissolved oxygen appears to increase in
preparations haveng the larger depth of sediment. Another difference
between these simulations is the initial rate of oxygen depletion is
much faster in tubes with 0.5cm sediment.
Figure 2 shows the effects of varying the height of the water
column while holding the level of sediment constant at 1.5cm. There
is a significantly faster drop in oxygen levels in tubes with shallower
sediment indicating that oxygen level is determined by diffusion. This
difference in rate of the initial oxygen depletion appears to be related
to the size of the initial amount of dissolved oxygen availible. Larger
volumes buffer against rapid change. Oxygen in the 25cm column decreases
more slowly because of a greater reservoir of oxygen. This buffering
by larger volume is also shown by the higher sulphide levels reached
in shallower tubes. Another intensity feature is the increase in oxygen
occuring with increasing sulphide on day five. This is most dramatic
in the shallower tubes.
In Figure 3 the height of the water column is held constant while
sediment depth is varied. As in figure 1, oxygen drops more rapidly in
tubes with less sediment. Also seen in figure 1 but more pronounced
here is the difference in oxygen levels for days four and five. For
the 1.5cm sediment oxygen increases steadily from day four, this is
