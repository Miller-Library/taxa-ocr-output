CONCLUSTO
The rosults presented here favorthe hypothesis that
DDT residues are concentrated at the air:water interface
relative to the subsurface zones. Problems encountered
in sampling, analysis, and population structure of the
study orcanisms tended to mask these dil
ferences.
The implications from this surface concentrating effect
may be significant. Any organism that is subjected to this
region will be brought into contact with higher concentrations
of DDT residues than its usual medium. Therefore surface
feeding larve, filter feeders, and skimming birds may be
receiving relatively high levels of pesticides in their food.
By this method an important means of DDT input to both marine
and terrestrial food webs is established.
