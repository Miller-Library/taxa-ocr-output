M-2
was the addition of 0.05g of acid washed Nuchar Attaclay
to the silica gol (Grade 950,mesh 60-200, dessicant-activated)
microcolumn to remove additional pigments and impurities.
In addition, the samples in tow number 5 were mixed with
metalic mercury to remove sulfur compounds.
Pesticide analysis was accomplished by a Beckman Go-I
gas liquid chromatograph. The solid support for the colunn
was 80-100 mesh Chromosorb W, acid washed and DMOS treated.
It was a mixed bed arrangoment, employing equal parts ol
65 QF 1 and 8% DC 200.
Initialidentification of peaks was based on retention
times as determined by known injected standards. Various
samples throughout the experiment were analyzed by
Pesticidequality hexane and acetonitrile partition
coefficients to supplement retention times.
