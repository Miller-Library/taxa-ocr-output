DISCUSSION
A comparison of the results with other values in the
literature is difficult because of the scarsity of the latter.
Woodwell etal. (1967) did find 10 ppb total DDT residues
in plankton from a polluted esturary on the East Coast.
Cox (a-1971) found 30 ppb in large pooled copepod samples
in Monterey Bay. (Converted to wet weight concentrations
as shown by Martin, 1971). These values compare with the
range of 10-37 ppb for individual samples in the three
inshore tows.
The differences between the neustonic and planktonic
populations were not as great as expected. This is undoubt-
edly due to sampling techniques which did not allow collection
of those organisms that are uniquely and consistently
found at the air :water interface. Instead of true "neustonic"
residenis, the organisms consisted primarily of vertically
migrating calanoid copepods. However, the fact that a trend
towards higher values (especially with DDT) was found in
the upper layers is encouraging. Here one must conclude
that the differences in residue values is attributable to
exposure to the concentrating capacity of the surface.
Marian (1971) found similar results when analyzing Hermissinda
ssicornis collected from floats and wharf pilings at
O.3-7.0 meters. The organisms at the surface had residue
values of 2.3 X that of the mean of the piling population.
