copopods may be duo to the location of the sewer outfalls,
other effulonts, and the marina inshore relative to off-
shore (Figure 1). Large differences in DDT values further
substantiate this rolationship, since the organisms immediate
responso to the onvironment would be reflected in these values.
In addition, the largest DDT values were found in the
tow nearest the two outfalls, with levels decreasing as
a function of distance from the effulents. The same correlation
with distance was found in Tow 1 away from the mouth ofthe
marina. Swarbrick (1971) found a similar falloff in the
same transect in DDT analysis of Pagurus samuelis.
The ctenaphores sampled from both dopths were showm
to be from the same population. Because of their sensitivity
to sunlight and weather conditions (Hyman,1910,p662, they
are in continual movement in the water column. This is
substantiated by observation of changing densities throughout
the five tows. This consistent fluctuation may eliminate
the possibility for effective concentration. In addition,
the high S/V ratio and high water content (95-97%) minimizies
the amount of adsorptive and assimilative surfaces.

may be a result of the strength of migration of the population.

The 0030-0230 runs of Tow 5 resulted in 99% E. pacilica
at both the surface and 10 meters. The 0600-0700 netted
only scattered euphausids in both samples. Accompaning
these movements is undoubtedly a large amount of mixing,
which would tend to mask differences in concentration levels.
