The upper layer of the ocean in enriched with potassium,
ammonium, organic nitrogen, and organic particulate matter
(Wilson,1959). The latter aggregates are produced in thin
films by the adsorption of dissolved organic material on
rising bubbles (as those produced by wave action and active
photosynthesis), other subsurface objects, and the sea surface
itsolf (Riley,1963,; ibid.,et.al.,1961; Siegal & Burke, 1965;
Blanchard,196; Sutcliffe, et.al.,1963.) This process allows
for a mechanism of concentration of DDT residues. Seba and
Corcoran (1969) have shown values of chlorinated hydrocarbns
up to 13 X 10"2 g/ml in surface slicks in Biscane, Florida,
mpared to approximately loi
g/ml in the surrounding water.

The fact that a small crustacean has been shown to exist
solely on organic aggregates (Baylor & Sutcliffe,1963) suggests
a means of entry of these concentrated pesticides into
various foodchains. DDT residues, being insoluble in water,
have been linked with specific particulates (Pfister, et.al.,
1969; Routh,1971), and hence would be ammendable to this
scheme of input.
The soa surface itself is a natural concentrator of
detrital matter. Most debris is either heavier or lighter
than sea water (Wilson, 1959). The latter rises to the tor
to form an upper layer, while the heavier sinks to benthic
