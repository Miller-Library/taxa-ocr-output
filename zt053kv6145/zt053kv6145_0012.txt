Supplementing the residence time with respect to
concontration are the proporties of injestion and adsorption
at the surface. Both of these properties are taking
place simultanoously (Cox,c-1971). As density increases,
loss pollutants are available/organism, and the concentration
values drop per unit weight. The fact that Cox (b-1971)
showed similar slopes for the density vs. concentration
of organic particulate matter may indicate that while at the
surface, adsorption contributes significantly to the total
DDT levels.
A third contribution to the inverse density:concentration
relationship is the location of the various tows. Location
of effluents could have completely determined the concentration
values irrespective of density. However, Lopez (1971) found
no correlation between values for heavy metals as a function
of location. He did demonstrate the same relationship for
y and concentration. This indicates that something
dens
more than location is responsible for this phenomenum.
That the planktonic samples did not exhibit this relation-
ship is presumably due to scattering after leaving the two
dimensional confinements of the surface.
