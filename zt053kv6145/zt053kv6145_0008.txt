The rosults of three inshore and two offshore tows
are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1. Table 2 gives
probability values for the following comparisons:
I. Examination of concentrations of all neustonic copepods
ys. all planktonic copepods yields p values of .10 for DDD
and.20 for DDT.
II. There is a significant difference between inshore
copepods and offshore copepods for DDE (p-.02) and DDT
(p-.001).

111. Comparison of ctenaphores (Pleurobrachia bachii) in

the neuston and plankton samples showed no signilicant
correlation (pp.10).
IV. A comparison between Euphasia pacifica in the neuston
and plankton samples yields p values y.30.
V. As the relative density of neustonic copepods decreased
in a series of runs, there was a corresponding increase
in the relative density of planktonic calanoid copepods
(Figure 2).
VI. There is an inverse correlation between relative densit
and concentration for individual DDT residues and sums in neustonic
calanoid copepods (Figures 3,1, & 5).
