INTRODUCTTON
Investigation of the unique properties of the air:
water interface with relation to DDT content of its resident
species has generally been neglected in the scientific
literature. There are, however, many important attributes
of this surface layer which indicate that it might play
a significant role in both the concentration and eventual
biological magnification of DDT.
The major difference between the surface layer and
other sub-surface depth zones is its constant contact with
the air. This allows significant imput of DDT residues due
to atmospheric fallout (Cox, a-1971; Risebrough,1968).
ly evidence suggesting this process were studies of:
i) the codistillation of chlorinated hydrocarbons with water
(Sowman, et.al.,1964; ibid.,1969); ii) its detection in air
and rain water (Antommaria, et.al.,1965; Abbot,et.al.,1965:
ibid.,1966; Wheally, et.al.,1966); iii) its appearance in
atmospheric dust originating in Texas and subsequently
deposited in Ohio (Cohen, et.al.,1966). More recent analysis
has shown that an average of 32 X 10 g of DDT residues
were present in dust particles over the Bay of Bengal
(Goldberg and Griffen,1970). Risebrough (1968) has found
1.8 X 10"2 total pesticides/gram of dust in La Jolla, Calif-
ornia. However, these estimates of pesticides should be
considered minimal. The sampling techniques used elimin-
ated particles less than one micron, which may constitute
