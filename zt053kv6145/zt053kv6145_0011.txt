Examination of Figure 2 shows an inverse relationship
between the rolative densities of the neustonic and planktonic
copepod populations. This is what one might expect from
a partly migrating species. That their migration is not
total is shown by their presence in different densities in
all tows at all times of the day. It is likely that some
organisms seldom leave the surface, while others spend most
of their time at subsurface depths. This is reasonable,
since in any migrating population, there will be member:
which are skowed to either side of the mean movement of
the population.
There is some evidence that this distribution may be
physiologically determined. Marshall and Orr (1955)
have noted that copepod females migrate to the surface to
lay their eggs. Moreover, females tend to migrate more
regularly than males. Bainbridge (1952) noted two distinct
layers of copepods in a summer bloom: a dense population
in the top 30 cm, and a subsurface layer in which the
copepods were more sparsley distributed.
That the relative density may be an indication of
residence time of the members in any one layer is shown
by the inverse relationship between concentration and
density in neustonic copepods (Figures345). As the relative
density of the neuston layer is decreased by downward
movement, the relative concentration of DDT residues is
increased, since the remaining animals will have been
exposed to the surface for a longer period.
