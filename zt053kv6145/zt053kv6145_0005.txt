sediments. The very fact that an interface is present is
significant, for they account for many of the chemical
roactions ofthe ocean (Horn,1969).
In most regions of the world, the surface layer is
inhabitated by unique neustonic populations (David,a-1971).
which have maximum contact with the interface. These in turn
are preyed upon by a variety of organisms which provide for
a means of both the concentration and transformation of DDT
through various trophic levels. These creatures include
larve, fish, vertically migrating predators, and skimming
birds (Cox,a-1971). The latter, especially, are known to
have very high concentrations of DDT (Tatton & Zicka,1967).
The surface in unique in its chemistry and tendency
to concentrate particulate matter. The chemical properties
of DDT residues associate themselves with particulates.
These two observations, in addition to the contribution to
atmospheric fallout, lead one to believe that surface organisms
leeding on surface populations and injesting and adsorbing
particulates at the air:water interface would show higher
levels of pesticides than organisms exposed to greater depth
zones. This experiment will attempt to show this phenomenum
mpling and analyzing several different groups of organ-

isms which are found at the surface (designated as neustonic),
These will be compared to similar organisms taken from
subsurface samples (labelled as plankton).
