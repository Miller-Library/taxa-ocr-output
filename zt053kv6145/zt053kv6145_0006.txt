Samples were collected using a nouston sled towed at the
surface (David,b-1965) and a small zooplankton net
simultaneously towed about ten meters below the surface.
The two nets had openings of similar area (0.016 M- for
the sled, 0.061 M for the plankton net) and similar mesh
(220.5 microns -- sled, 291 microns -- plankton net).
The sled was either towed off to the side of the boat
by moans of a boom, or was trailed far enough aft so that
the wake had little effect. Tows lasted from one-half hour
to one hour. All inshore tows were taken at about the same
time of day. Boat speed was recorded and used in the cal-
culations of relative biomass density. While on board, the
fresh samples were taken from the net and placed in acid-
cleaned (M-6 N HNO,) glasswear, covered with aluminum foil,
and stored on ice.
In the lab, major groups of organisms were seperated
from each other. This usually consisted of seperating
calaniod copepods from ctenaphores (Pleurobrachia bachii)
jatina). This was easily done
and medusea (especially Oct
by the sample through a course (inch mesh) net. The
remaining sample was strained through a ring of phytoplankton
netting, retaining the copepod segment of the sample.
Excess water was removed and wet weights recorded.
Initial preparation of the samples was done by the
method described by Burnett (1971). The only deviation
