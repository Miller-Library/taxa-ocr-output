Uptake of C+0, and C glycine by
zooxanthellae and Anthopleura elegantissima
Richard M. Leonard*
Abstract--1. C+0, and C-glycine are both incorporated into the
free amino acids of Anthopleura elegantissima and its
zooxanthellae.
2. C+ is incorporated in greater concentration by
zooxanthellae than by Anthopleura elegantissima
Introduction
The uptake of C labelled substances and the subsequent
transference of C+ labelled photosynthetic products by endozoic
zooxanthellae to their coelenterate host has been demonstrated
in the Zoanthid Zoanthus flosmarinus (von Holt and von Holt 1968a).
In subsequent study if was shown that the endozoic zooxanthellae
were unable to synthesize their own glycine when given COg or when
given serine which is the immediate precursor in the glycine synthetic
pathway (C. von Holt 1968 ). Using " radio-tracer" methods it was
shown (C. von Holt 1968 ) that zooxanthellae preferentially
incorporated over other amino acids C
labelled glycine into their
amino acid pools, indicating a possible specific metabolic interaction
in the Zoanthus-zooxanthellae symbiotic relationship. These observations
prompted a study of the dynamics of CO, and glycine uptake in the
Actinaria Anthopleura elegantissima to see if there was any similarity
to the dynamics of Zoanthus flosmarinus.
Materials and Methods
Specimens of the experimental animal Anthopleura elegantissima
were collected from the intertidal region of Mussel Point in Pacific
Grove California. Oral discs of all the specimens were between 3 and
4cm in diameter at maximum expansion. Animals were kept in running
seawater prior to experiments. The isolation procedure of the
zooxanthellae from the coelenterate was that of von Holt and von Holt
(1968a).
