Visual learning in the common cuttlefish, page 6
seems to have learned the task after 30 trials. The increase in scores, and the overall trend
of increase, is significant evidence that this particular animal did lear to choose the
constant light over the blinking light. There was also a significant difference between the
scores for the trials before the reversal and those after the reversal process had begun.
The second animal also learned the simple association task, but there was not
significant scores until after trial 40. This increased length of time could be due to variation
between the animals, or to the problems associated with the experimental design, as
discussed above.
Conclusion
This paper has provided evidence that the cuttlefish has the capability to associate
either a flashing light or a constant light with a reward of food. The experimental set-up
was also seen to have an important effect on the success of the learning process, and
further research would need to be done to correct some of the problems associated with this
experimental design. It would also be useful to continue the reversal experiment in order to
determine the speed at which a change in choice can occur.
Further research of interest would include studying the patterns of activity in the brain
at the onset of a visual stimulus that the animal has learned to associate with a reward. In
this way, perhaps more could be understood about the functioning of the cuttlefish brain.
Since the animals are able to perceive the difference between flashing and constant
stimuli, further research of interest could also focus on flashing lights of different
frequencies, to determine at which frequency the animal is no longer able to distinguish
between the two stimuli.
