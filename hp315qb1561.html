differences on the warmest days. Most larger prey of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>N. emarginata</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus glandula : Exact'>(Balanus glandula</span>
and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>Mytilus californianus)</span> were more abundant is sun-exposed regions while smaller
prey species <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus : Exact'>(Chthamalus</span> spp.) were more abundant is sun-protected areas. Proportions
of marked whelks that were feeding varied widely between 5 and 68% on days when
exposed temperature was below 28° C. Above 28° C, however, percent feeding never
exceeded 10% and declined as temperatures rose higher. Whelks that remained feeding
in sun exposed areas at the higher temperatures fed predominately on larger, more
valuable prey that can take several days to drill and consume, thus experiencing greater
potential thermal stress. Whelks transplanted to a nearby site traveled farther than control
whelks and sought appropriate shelter before the next low tide (avg. temp = 31.2° C).
They remained more sedentary than controls for the week following transplant, after
which they resumed foraging similar to the controls. These results suggest that N.
emarginata is conservative in its response to high temperatures during low tide. The
response does, however, limit the time available for feeding on larger prey. Consistently
warmer temperatures could serve to shift the preferred prey species.
Introduction
The rocky intertidal ecosystem is a challenging environment for its inhabitants.
Organisms must face breaking waves, desiccation stress, and mobile predators while
submerged and exposed. Most demanding of all are the sudden and extreme changes in
temperature that face the intertidal organism (Newell and Branch 1980). For an animal to
be successful, it must be able to either avoid or tolerate these temperature extremes. An
understanding of how intertidal organisms respond to temperature is crucial as the
prospects of global climate change become a reality. At the cellular level, Stickle et al
(1985) explored increased temperatures with aerial exposure and salinity in terms of
lysosomal stability (as a proxy for heat stress) in intertidal whelks. Tomanek and Somero
(2000, 2002) examined heat shock protein production as a function of thermal stress in
intertidal turban snails. With regard to temperature effects on the ecosystem level,
Largen (1967), Garton and Stickle (1980), and Sanford (2002) examined the effects of
increased water temperature on predation rates of sea stars and whelks. Since intertidal
organisms live in both water and air, it is important to understand how temperature
affects them differently in each. This study investigated how feeding behavior is affected
by temperature stress during aerial exposure at low tide. While Hughes and Dunkin
(1984) and West (1986) have performed behavioral studies on prey selection in intertidal
whelks, very little is known about day to day behavioral changes associated with
temperature stress.
Nucella emarginata is an intertidal predatory whelk that feeds predominately on
barnacles and mussels (Abbott and Haderlie 1980). Predation is an important factor in
many ecosystems, affecting not only prey distribution and abundance, but overall
community structure (Kerfoot and Sih 1987, Lubchenco and Real 1991). The genus
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nucella : Exact'>Nucella</span> is an important predator on the Pacific coast (Spight 1974, Palmer 1983, and
Navarette 1996), as well as in New England (Menge 1983) and Britain (Connell 1961).
The objectives of this study were: (1) To correlate feeding behavior in N.
emarginata with physical factors such as temperature and sun exposure. (2) To identify
thresholds that limit exposure to high temperatures. The results suggest that N.
emarginata are sensitive to sub-lethal temperatures and limit their sun exposure when
temperatures exceed a critical threshold. Furthermore, this exposure response to
temperature is tightly correlated with feeding since most large prey occur in sun¬
exposed, thermally hazardous microhabitats.
Materials and Methods
Study Sites and Biota
This study was carried out in Pacific Grove, California (36°36' N, 121°54' W).
Study sites were on the protected shore next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium on the
property of Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University. Study sites were examined
during each period of lowest day time low water between 6 May and 23 May 2003. Site
1 is a 5 m2 cluster of small, compact granitic boulders located at 0.75 m above mean low
water. Site 2 is a 6 m2 large cement piling surrounded by sand, characterized by flat rock
and fewer cracks and crevices than Site 1. Site 2 is located at 0.90 m above mean low
water. The 2 sites are separated by 50 meters and consist of similar abundance of
Chthamalus spp., Balanus glandula, and Mytilus californianus, the major prey species of
Nucella emarginata. Öther species present at each site are the gastropods <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula funebralis : Exact'>Tegula

Daily Feeding and Temperature Observations
1 marked 35 Nucella emarginata at each site (70 total) with different colors and
numbers in order to differentiate between individuals. Marking was done with ordinary
nail polish and remained intact during the course of the study. I observed the daily
feeding behavior of individuals in the field during periods of lowest day time low water,
missing three periods of lowest low water (n = 3 out of 18 observation periods). Nucella
typically mount their prey and drill through the shell with their radula. They do this until
they are able to scrape out the soft parts with their proboscis. This process may last only
a few hours on small prey while larger mussels can take up to 8 days. When a snail is
feeding during a receding tide, it continues to grip its prey but does not extend its
proboscis when exposed to air. Thus the feeding process is prolonged further. I followed
the techniques of West (1986) in observing N. emarginata’s feeding. To summarize the
technique, determination of snail feeding was always made with minimal disturbance.
Only with the smallest prey species was it sometimes necessary to gently tilt the shell to
determine prey identity. A small mirror also proved to be useful when a snail was hidden
in a crack or crevice. In all cases, active predation was indicated when the snail encircled
the prey with the anterior of the foot and located its buccal mass atop the opercular plates
of barnacles or between the valves a mussel.
In addition to observing daily feeding activity, I noted each individual snail's sun
exposure as well as the characteristic snail body temperature at that exposure. Areas of
rock were deemed sun-exposed if they received direct sunlight throughout most day time
low tides in May (only shaded during very early morning or late afternoon daytime low
tides). Protected areas were those that rarely received direct sunlight. Since I did not
want to disturb feeding activity, I was unable to measure snail body temperatures
directly. For this measurement I used gelatin (Knoxß brand) filled N. emarginata shells
as a proxy for snail body temperature. Prior temperature tests of the gelatin snail
consistently fell within 0.5’C below the actual snail body temperatures (allowing 2
minutes equilibration time). The small difference is due to the relatively minor thermal
inertia of gastropods. In order to determine the temperature regime at different sun
exposures, 1 performed a daily transect of temperature measurements across each site,
Temperatures of the gelatin snail were taken at both sun-exposed and protected areas
every 0.5 m along the transect line. Transects ran both across the length and the width of
each site. I used a digital microprocessor thermocouple for the temperature readings.
Prevailing tidal heights and timing, as well as daily weather, cloud cover, and surf
conditions were also noted.
Prey Abundance and Distribution
In order to assess the relative abundances of each of the major prey species, I
performed a survey of each site. This was done with a 0.25 m2 quadrat positioned
repeatedly over different sections of the site until the whole site was surveyed. First,
percentage of quadrat that was sun-exposed or protected was noted. Then percent cover
of each prey species <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus fissus : Exact'>(Chthamalus fissus</span> and <span style='background-color:grey' title='Chthamalus dalli : Fuzzy'>Cthamalus dalli</span> were lumped as one prey
species) within each exposure was determined. Total areas of each quadrat were then
summed across the entire site.
Transplant Experiment
1 performed a transplant experiment in order to differentiate between site-specific
temperature/exposure responses and general environmental responses. I moved 8
experimental N. emarginata (4 from each sun-protected and sun-exposed areas) from Site
1 to Site 2 and placed them in comparable exposure regimes. A control group was
removed from the substrate for the same amount of time as the experimental group, but
was subsequently returned to the same location on the rock. I then monitored the
responses of the two groups for 2 weeks following the transplant.
Results
Temperature Patterns
Temperatures varied significantly both among different days of the study as well
as within different sun-exposures of each site (Table 1, Fig.1). Average temperatures
ranged from 16.1° C to 32.8° C in sun-exposed areas and from 13.8° C to 21.2° C in
protected areas. Temperatures of sun-exposed areas were always greater than those in
protected areas (mean difference of 7.5° C), with the greatest differences on the warmest
days (11-May and 21-May). On a given day, temperatures were consistent between sites
at each exposure level.
Prey Abundance
Prey abundances varied among different sun-exposures. Abundances were
substantially greater in sun-exposed areas of Site 1 (Fig. 2). Sun-exposed prey accounted
for 33% of the total plot area while protected prey accounted for 18%. Prey abundance
and exposure differed between prey species as well. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus : Exact'>Balanus</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus : Exact'>Mytilus</span> accounted for
17% and 8% of the total area in sun-exposed areas, while only 3% each in sun-protected
areas. In contrast, Chthamalus spp. was slightly less abundant is sun-exposed areas.
where coverage was 8% compared to sun-protected areas with 12%. These results are
consistent with the behavioral studies on prey identity and exposure levels (Fig. 3). In
sun-exposed areas, there were 92 feeding events upon Balanus and 41 feeding events
upon Mytilus, while there were only 14 and 7, respectively, in sun-protected regions.
This is a decrease of about 85% for each prey species. In contrast, the number of feeding
events upon Chthamalus dropped only 19% from 32 in sun-exposed areas to 26 in sun-
protected areas.
Behavioral Patterns
Habitat use of N. emarginata varied from day to day. Percentages of observed
populations (usually 50-60 of 70 total) at each exposure level and the percent feeding
fluctuated between low tides (Tables 2 and 3). On some days none of the population was
exposed or feeding (22-May at Site 2) while others had well over half both sun-exposed
and feeding (17 and 18-May at Site 2). This was consistent between sites as there were
no significant differences in exposure levels or feeding rates between the two sites
(P=.35, t-test). In addition, feeding and sun exposure were tightly correlated on a day to
day basis at each site (Fig. 4, r2=.78, PS.01). There is also a relationship between feeding
rates and the timing of spring tides (Fig. 5). Average feeding rate for the entire
population (Sites 1 and 2 are lumped) between spring tides is significantly higher (PS.01,
t-test) during early-morning/late-afternoon low tides than mid-day low tides. Differences
between time of day during neap tides are not significant (P=.30, t-test), nor are there
overall differences between spring and neap tides pooled over times of day. There were
87 feeding events during spring tides and 72 during the neap tides (8 days of each tide).
Temperature and Behavior
Feeding and sun exposure were each dependent on the sun-exposed temperature.
On colder days there was very little correlation between temperature and sun exposure
(Fig. 6). When the average exposed temperature was below 28° C, proportions of snails
that were sun exposed varied from 10 to 70%. Above 28° C, however, percent sun
exposed rarely exceeded 10% and declined as temperatures rose higher. This relationship
is reflected in the feeding data. While there is no relationship between feeding and
temperature on colder days, no more than 10% of the population at either site fed on days
when the exposed average temperature exceeded 28° C (Fig. 7). As with sun exposure,
feeding rates declined as temperatures rose higher. The dominant prey species also
differed substantially with increased temperatures (Fig. 6). Below 28° C, Mytilus
accounted for 22% of prey consumed, while Balanus and Chthamalus accounted for 48%
and 28% of prey, respectively. (Fig 8) When the sun-exposed temperature exceeded 28
C, Mytilus accounted for 62% of consumed prey, with Balanus and Chthamalus at only
5% and 12%.
Transplant Experiment
Snails were transplanted to both exposed and protected areas of Site 2. The day
following transplant, when average sun-exposed temperature was 31.2' C, each of the
transplanted snails found protected regions of the new site. The transplanted snails also
traveled significantly longer distances than the control snails (Pk.O1, t-test) to reach them
(Fig. 9). From the start of the first day, transplanted snails traveled an average of 0.45 m
while the control snails averaged about 0.17 m. During subsequent days, the transplanted
snails did not move from the sheltered regions they had found the first day, even on days
when the control group was sun exposed and/or feeding. Äfter one week the transplanted
snails resumed feeding rates similar to those of the controls.
Discussion
Since the majority of their prey inhabit sun-exposed areas, feeding by N.
emarginata results in increased sun exposure. This exposure poses a potential thermal
stress during low tide when temperatures are higher. The potential stress varies with prey
species, since Mytilus and Balanus live predominantly in sun-exposed areas while
Chthamalus is slightly more abundant in sun-protected regions. This is a common
situation in the intertidal, where many prey species have spatial refuges in areas that are
too harsh for their predators, but still hospitable enough for them. The best known
example is that of the predatory sea star <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pisaster ochraceous : Exact'>Pisaster ochraceous</span> and its prey species, Mytilus
(Paine 1974)
The extent of thermal stress associated with feeding depends on temperatures
during low tide. Low tide temperatures vary markedly from day to day, as well as
between sun-exposed and protected areas. These fluctuations appear to affect feeding by
N. emarginata only when temperatures exceed 28° C. Below this temperature, there is
very little correlation between temperature and sun exposure, while fewer than 10% of
the whelks fed during temperatures above 28° C. The transition appears to be very
sudden, as there were days when the sun-exposed temperatures approached 28° C and as
much as 50% of the population was still exposed and feeding.
The extent of sun-exposure (and extent of thermal stress) correlates with prey size
and handling time. N. emarginata does not respond as strongly to the temperature
threshold when there is the prospect of a high food reward. Mytilus is the largest prey
species, averaging 14 mm larger and 2 days longer handling time than the barnacles
(West 1986). Although absolute feeding rates declined quickly at higher temperatures,
feeding on <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Mytilus : PartialExact'>Mytilus rose</span> from 22% of total prey consumed below 28° C to 62% above this
threshold temperature. This implies that whelks may tolerate a greater thermal risk if
they have already invested considerable time in drilling a large prey or if the risk is offset
by a greater potential food reward. The existence of such tradeoffs would bear further
investigation.
The large differences in feeding rates between mid-day and early/late day spring
tides are likely due to the increased emersion time associated with these tides. Longer
emersion time corresponds to a greater thermal risk associated with feeding. Feeding
rates were not significantly different between mid-day and early/late day neap tides, as
exposure to air was relatively short and high temperatures are less of a threat.
The transplant experiments show that individual N. emarginata maintain their
threshold response even in an unfamiliar environment. When placed in the new
environment, the transplanted snails were able to both detect a threatening temperature
and find appropriate shelter (average exposed temperature of 31.2° C the day following
transplantation). For the week following the transplant, experimental snails did not move
from the sheltered regions they had found the first day. This was the case even on days
11
when the control group was exposed and feeding. Äfter one week, however, the
transplanted snails left their protected locations and exhibited behavior similar to that of
the control snails. Thus there is an initial shock with transplant, but overall feeding
behavior is still flexible. Since observations were not possible during high tide, it is
possible that the snails did indeed leave their protected areas. They could have fed on
small prey and/or became familiar with their new surroundings until able to leave their
shelter over the course of a low tide.
As the prospects of global climate change become more of a reality, questions
concerning how biological systems will respond to temperature increases become
increasingly pertinent. Peterson et al (1993) and Bhaud et al (1995) examined the
implications of climate change on marine ecosystems and interactions. My study focuses
on one such interaction and suggests a specific and direct thermal risk associated with
predation. While Sanford (2002) showed that increased water temperatures in submerged
Nucella caused' increased feeding rates on mussels, this study shows decreased feeding
rates at high temperatures during aerial exposure. In this way, warmer temperatures can
have multiple, seemingly contrasting effects. The predominate effect depends on both
the magnitude of warming and the media surrounding the animal. Given an air
temperature increase of a 1-2° C, how would N. emarginata respond? How close is this
species to its thermal limits? Sorte (personal communication) has found that N.
emarginata experiences heat coma at 35° C. The heat coma occurs when a snail is no
longer able to remain attached to the substrate. Maximum temperatures for individual
snails during the course of this study exceeded 35° C on 4 different days. Relative to
this, the sheltering response at 28° C then seems fairly conservative. Physiological
﻿12
responses at these lower temperatures may indeed indicate other forms of sub-lethal
stress. This response does, however, directly impact their feeding behavior and limit
available feeding time.
West (1986) showed that individual N. emarginata vary markedly in diet. How
flexible is their diet? Heinrich (1976) and Werner et al (1981) document instances where
individuals are able to change their preferred diet when necessary. Thus there is the
possibility of smaller and more protected prey species becoming more preferred as low
tide temperatures increase. This can have impacts on succession as mussel beds expand
in response to lessened predation as described by Paine (1974). Conversely, predation
intensity would increase on smaller and more sun-protected prey species such as
Chthamalus.
Possible fürther experiments would be to monitor feeding of N. emarginata at
more time points, specifically during high tides. A field experiment with plots of snails
subjected to added heat stress could show behavioral changes experimentally.
Laboratory studies involving thermal tolerance, lethal temperatures, or heat shock protein
production in Nucella would give insight into physiological mechanisms underlying
thermal stress.
