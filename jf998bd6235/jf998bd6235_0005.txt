Transects ran perpendicular to the shoreline from the higher intertidal (beyond the
vertical limit of anemone distribution) to the lowest point that was sufficiently exposed to
sample at low tide. .25 m’ quadrats were placed on altering sides of each transect at every
meter. A. sola and A. xanthogrammica individuals were counted and recorded and
percent cover of A. elegantissima was estimated within quadrats. A visual estimate of
algal cover and substrate was also recorded. Quadrat heights were estimated using
reference heights with known absolute heights above MLLW, a surveyor’s level, and a
4m stadia rod.
Temperature data were obtained every hour starting at 7am and continuing until
the tide had risen high enough to submerge all A. sola individuals and the majority of A.
xathogrammica individuals at 2pm. Body temperature was measured using a
thermocouple. Forty A. xanthogrammica individuals and 40 A. sola individuals were
sampled, almost all of which were emersed for the majority of the sampling period,
which occurred from 7am to 2pm. Individual A. xanthogrammica were all located within
roughly a 1Om radius at a wave-exposed site and individual A. sola were all located
within a roughly 1Om radius at a wave-protected site (Fig. 2). These sites were chosen to
represent the exposed area as a whole and the protected area as a whole. If anything, the
chosen protected site (where A. sola individuals were monitored) was not as warm and
sheltered as many of the other sites, thus any differences indicated by the study are likely
amplified in other regions of the intertidal.
