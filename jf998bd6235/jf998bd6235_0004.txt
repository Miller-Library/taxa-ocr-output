and differing latitudinal ranges made them ideal species to examine for relationships
between temperature and distribution.
Field experiments were conducted in the rocky intertidal at Hopkins Marine
Station (HMS) of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, CA (36°36’N, 121°54’W). The
study site lies within the Lovers Point State Marine Reserve, one of the four small marine
protected areas in the Monterey/Pacific Grove coastline. Its latitude within the
overlapping region of the three study species’ ranges makes it a key location to study
potential species distribution and abundance shifts.
Transects to assess species abundance were completed during low tide 19 April,
20 April, 21 April, 29 April, 30 April, 3 May, 17 May, and 19 May (2010). A. sola and A.
xanthogrammica body temperatures were measured on 19 May, 2010.
Experimental Design
Six transects were chosen to represent wave-exposed environments and six were
chosen to represent protected environments. The protected sites were mostly shielded
from incoming waves by large rocks and thus experienced less wave action and reached
warmer temperatures than the exposed sites (Fig. 1). Two transects, one in an exposed
area and one in a protected area, were sampled by a Stanford University biology class
along transects which were delineated by permanent bolts on the rocks and which have
been monitored for species abundances since 2002. The remaining ten transects were
chosen to span the majority of the point, 5 in exposed areas and 5 in protected areas (Fig.
