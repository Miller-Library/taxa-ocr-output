zoochlorellate A. xanthogrammica are unable to acquire zooxanthellae as they lose
zoochlorellae, they may become aposymbiotic. As aposymbiotic anemones lose mass
more quickly during starvation than those with symbionts (Sebens 1983), this could have
profound effects on the survival of A. xanthogrammica if prey abundances decline.
A. elegantissima and A. sola must cope with the environmental stresses associated
with their habitats. To handle elevated sunlight exposure, they attach gravel and other
debris to their body surfaces as an effective sunscreen that reduces zooxanthellae
expulsion (Dykens and Shick 1984). In addition to this protection, A. elegantissima
respond biochemically and behaviorally to sunlight and photosynthetically generated
oxygen stress by increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in proportion to
chlorophyll concentration, and by contracting and shading zooxanthellae (Dykens and
Shick 1984). If anemones experience shifts in symbiont densities from less productive
zoochlorellae to more productive zooxanthellae, these photodynamic stresses may
increase and force anemones to invest more into enzymatic defenses, which could come
at a cost to growth or reproduction.
There are clear differences in the distributions of A. xanthogrammica and A. sola
in the rocky intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station. A. xanthogrammica appear to prefer
more wave-exposed areas while A. sola favor more protected areas. Multiple factors may
influence these differences, including competitive exclusion, prey abundance, and
temperature. The temperatures of emersed A. xanthogrammica individuals were
significantly lower than those of emersed A. sola, suggesting that temperature may be a
major factor influencing species distributions not only at wide latitudinal scales but also
at local scales, such as around the point at the Hopkins Marine Station. The temperature
