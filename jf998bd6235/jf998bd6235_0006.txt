T-tests were used to compare the mean number of A. xanthogrammica per square
meter in exposed sites versus protected sites. The same was done for A. sola. T-tests were
also used to compare the mean height of A. xanthogrammica and A. sola individuals
along common transects. Lastly, T-tests were used to identify significant differences in
the mean temperatures of A. xanthogrammica and A. sola at each hour of the thermal
study.
Results
Abundance Study
A. xanthogrammica and A. sola differed distinctly in abundance along the
Hopkins shoreline (Fig. 3). The mean population density of A. xanthogrammica was
significantly higher in exposed areas compared to protected areas (t = 2.933, P =.015;
Fig. 4). The mean density of A. sola showed the opposite pattern and was significantly
greater in protected transects compared to exposed areas (t = 4.522, P =.001; Fig. 5).
An attempt to compare height distributions of A. xanthogrammica and A. sola was
made, however results were relatively inconclusive due to the limited number of transects
with both species present. Only transects A and E had sufficient individuals of each
species to analyze mean height of anemones statistically. Mean heights of A.
xanthogrammica were significantly higher than A. sola along transect E (t = 2.851, P -
.009; Fig. 6) but not significantly different along transect A (t =.864, P =.404; Fig. 7).
Temporal comparisons between the abundances of each Anthopleura species
along the two class transects (C and J) this year and previous years were inconclusive.
The extent of sampling each year was contingent upon the height of the tide and intensity
