relationships of each speciesâ€™ lethal thermal tolerance, metabolism, and symbiont
composition will be of increasing importance as climate change warms intertidal
ecosystems. Due to these effects, I suspect that future years and higher temperatures may
produce an increase in the abundance of A. sola at Hopkins Marine Station and a decrease
in A. xanthogrammica. This study provides a baseline against which future changes in the
composition of Anthopleura congeners may be compared.
