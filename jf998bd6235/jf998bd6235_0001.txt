Anthopleura Sea Anemone Distribution
in the Rocky Intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station
Abstract
Climate change has already begun to change species abundances and distributions
within intertidal habitats. Monitoring such changes over time provides valuable
information about potential shifts in ecosystem dynamics. Congeners of the sea anemone
Anthopleura are conspicuous members of intertidal communities along the North
American Pacific coast. Previous studies have shown that these congeners differ in their
latitudinal habitat range. This study attempted to discern the distribution of anemones in
the intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station. It found that A. xanthogrammica were
significantly more abundant in the exposed areas on the western side of the point, while
A. sola were significantly more abundant on the relatively protected eastern side of the
point. These distributions were correlated with temperatureâ€”the body temperatures of
emersed A. xanthogrammica were significantly lower than those of A. sola. Potential
decreases in the more cold-adapted A. xanthogrammica and increases in the warm-
adapted A. sola may occur as climate change ensues, and this study provides a baseline
against which future distribution studies may be compared.
