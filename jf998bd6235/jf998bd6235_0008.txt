species were present and thus the assessment of differences in vertical distributions was
inconclusive. Of the two transects analyzed for differences in mean anemone height, one
suggested that A. xanthogrammica inhabited a slightly (less than 0.5 m) higher section of
the intertidal. This counters the expected direction of difference yet it is relatively
inconsequential since there are no replicates to support the conclusion. The clear support
for a lateral separation of species and lack of data/evidence for a vertical separation of
species may indicate that wave exposure plays a more dominant role in setting
distributions than do vertical gradients in physical conditions. However, the design of the
study may skew conclusions as transects could not pick up as much fine scale variability
as might be necessary to determine height specificity. It is therefore possible that A.
xanthogrammica generally prefers lower habitats, just as past research has shown
(Francis 1988).
Though there were not a sufficient number of A. elegantissima clones along
transect lines, a rough survey of the rocks surrounding transects suggested a clear site
preference of this cloning anemone. Large colonies were often observed on the sides of
rock faces in protected areas but rarely seen in wave-exposed areas. This is consistent
with previous research which identified A. elegantissima as confined to protected outer
coast sites or moderately exposed inner coast sites in the Pacific northwest (Sebens
1983).
The apparent lack of overlap in species within regions of the intertidal may be due
to competitive exclusion. In discussing the limited northward extent of A. sola, Russo
(1984) suggested that A. xanthogrammica might competitively exclude A. sola. These
forces may be at play on a smaller scale in the intertidal off Pacific Grove as well.
