Figure 8. Mean temperature of emersed anemones at each hour of measurement are
shown with 95% confidence interval bars. Table 1 presents the relevant values of t-tests
for differences between A. xanthogrammica and A. sola temperatures at each hour.
Table 1. Results of t-tests comparing the average temperature of emersed A.
xanthogrammica individuals and emersed A. sola individuals at each hour of the study
show that differences are significant at each time of measurement.
