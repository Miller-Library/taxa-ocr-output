Introduction
The thermal tolerances and optimal temperature ranges of species may be
increasingly important as the effects of climate change intensify. From the hydrothermal
vents at the bottom of the ocean to the rocky intertidal at the surface, species distributions
are commonly correlated with temperature gradients. For example, the vertical
distributions of Tegula congeners in the intertidal are set by thermal tolerance limits
(Tomanek and Somero 1999). For these snails (and many other organisms) these
tolerance levels are associated with heat damage to proteins and other physiological
structures, and the speciesâ€™ ability to respond to stress with heat shock proteins (Tomanek
and Somero 1999). Latitudinal species ranges are also often associated temperature
gradients and thermal tolerance. For example the upper and lower thermal limits of
different species of porcelain crabs of the genus Petrolisthes, as set by cardiac function,
correspond to habitat temperatures in colder temperate regions and warmer tropical
regions (Stillman 2003).
Such thermal tolerances have profound implications for warming associated with
climate change. As warmer temperatures spread to higher latitudes, species replacements
and distribution shifts are likely to create drastic changes in intertidal ecosystems. Such
distribution shifts have already begun to occur. A study of limpet congeners at Hopkins
Marine Station illustrates a northward shift in both species (Crummett and Eernisse
2007). The range of the southern congener, Lottia austrodigitalis, was found to have
shifted substantially northward at the expense of the northern congener, Lottia digitalis,
between 1978 and 1998 (Crummett and Eernisse 2007). Another study at Hopkins
Marine Station identified increases in southern invertebrates and decreases in northern
