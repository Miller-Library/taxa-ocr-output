the North American Atlantic coast indicated a clear correlation between habitat
temperature and upper lethal temperature of anemone species (Sassaman and Mangum
1970). The southern limit of species ranges in Metridium senile, Diadumene leucolena,
and Haliplanella luciae correlated to lethal temperature, with the northernmost species
(Metridium senile) having the lowest lethal temperature and the southernmost species
(Haliplanella luciae) having the highest lethal temperature (Sassaman and Mangum
1970). Sassaman and Mangum (1970) noted that the three species had otherwise
ecologically similar niches and suggested that temperature was therefore the likely
constraint on species ranges. They further noted that the metabolic rates of anemones
were subject to Qjo effects, thus indicating a mechanism of temperature sensitivity
(Sassaman and Mangum 1970). Given the analogous restrictions on the ranges
Anthopleura congeners, similar effects may dictate latitudinal distribution limits in these
Pacific anemones. Furthermore, it is possible that such temperature sensitivity exists on a
local scale between cooler wave-exposed areas and warmer protected areas to set
distribution limits within one intertidal location as well.
The relationships between temperature and algal symbionts of Anthopleura
species have been studied extensively and may affect anemone distributions as well.
Anthopleura congeners may have one or two species of algal symbionts—some have
solely zooxanthellae, some have solely zoochlorellae, and some have both—and the
relative proportion of either symbiont is closely correlated to light/temperature gradients
(O’Brien and Wyttenbach 1980, Secord and Augustine 2000, McCloskey et al. 1996,
Secord and Muller-Parker 2005). A study of A. xanthogrammica and A. elegantissima
showed that zoochlorellae are commonly associated with the cooler temperatures at
