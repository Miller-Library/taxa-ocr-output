invertebrates from the 1930s to the 1990s (Barry et al. 1995). Continued observations of
the occurrence and rate of these shifts provide valuable information about global,
regional, and local impacts of climate change.
Sea anemones of the genus Anthopleura have different latitudinal distributions
with wide overlapping ranges. Anthopleura xanthogrammica and Anthopleura sola, two
solitary Anthopleura species, both have considerable populations in the California rocky
intertidal. A. xanthogrammica has a more northern distribution, ranging from northern
Baja to Alaska (Sagarin and Gaines 2002). Meanwhile A. sola ranges from central Baja
to northern California (Sagarin and Gaines 2002). This study attempted to provide
baseline knowledge of the relative abundances of each species in the rocky intertidal at
Hopkins Marine Station. This map of Anthopleura distributions may be a useful
comparison for future studies. Furthermore this study attempted to determine if either
congener had a habitat preference (in relation to the vertical gradient or the lateral
gradient from exposed to protected regions) within the intertidal. Lastly, the study sought
to determine correlations between temperature and species abundance.
Methods
Study Species and Study Site
Primarily two species of Anthopleura sea anemones were assessed: A. sola and A.
xanthogrammica. A. elegantissima, the cloning Anthopleura, was also considered, but the
spatially heterogeneous nature of A. elegantissima colonies complicated sampling efforts
and thus focus was given to the two solitary species instead. The prevalence of A.
xanthogrammica and A. sola in the intertidal, their relatively easily identifiable features,
