higher latitudes and in the lower intertidal, while zooxanthellae are more abundant in
anemones at lower latitudes or higher in the intertidal (Secord and Augustine 2000).
Another study of A. xanthogrammica identified a transition from solely zoochlorellate
individuals in the subtidal and low intertidal to anemones with mixed algal populations in
the middle intertidal to exclusively zooxanthellate anemones in the high intertidal
(O’Brien and Wyttenbach 1980). A shift from zooxanthellate to zoochlorellate A.
elegantissima along a gradient from light-exposed to fully shaded environments in an
intertidal cave show the same correlation (Secord and Muller-Parker 2005).
The composition of algal symbionts within a host may have significant
implications on the growth and reproduction of the host. Zooxanthellae respire and
photosynthesize at a higher rate than zoochlorellae and translocate a substantially greater
amount of carbon to their hosts (contribution of carbon to animal respiration was
estimated at 48% for zooxanthellate anemones but only 9% for zoochlorellate anemones)
(Alan Verde and McCloskey 1996). A study of A. elegantissima revealed that
temperature increase from 13°C to 20°C caused a significant reduction in density of
zoochlorellae which led to zoochlorellate anemones receiving 3.5 times less carbon at
20°C (Engebretson and Muller-Parker 1999). As zoochlorellae are more temperature
sensitive, warming due to climate change will likely have significant effects on the
densities of these two symbionts in their Anthopleura hosts. Given the symbionts'
different nutritional contributions to their hosts these shifts may have profound effects on
the growth and reproductive abilities of anemones. Since zoochlorellae are typically
associated with larger individuals in the lower intertidal (Secord and Augustine 2000), A.
xanthogrammica may experience more dramatic shifts in symbiont composition. If
