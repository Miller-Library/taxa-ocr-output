of waves— in years when the tide was higher or waves were bigger, the lower portion of
the transect was not assessed. This makes it difficult to compare year to year. In addition,
dubious and dramatic species shifts suggested by the class’ data are likely
misidentifications rather than true changes.
Thermal Study
Though 40 A. xanthogrammica and 40 A. sola individuals were observed in the
thermal study, some of these were submerged by changing tides. Due to the
overwhelming control of the ambient water temperature on the core temperature of
submerged anemones, these individuals were not included in statistical analyses of the
Anthopleura temperatures. Hourly comparisons of mean body temperatures showed
significantly higher values for A. sola for every time measured (t-tests, Table 1; Fig. 8).
Discussion
Anthopleura xanthogrammica and Anthopleura sola show clearly defined spatial
patterns with A. xanthogrammica primarily occupying the wave-exposed western side of
the point at Hopkins Marine Station and A. sola occupying the protected eastern side of
the point. These observations are consistent with previous findings that A.
xanthogrammica inhabits less protected habitats and is especially abundant in surge
channels, crevices, and areas which are constantly washed over by water, as compared to
A. sola, which generally favors calmer pools and rock surfaces (Sagarin and Gaines 2002;
Russo 1984). I expected to find a correlation between height in the intertidal and species
as well, however these results were inconclusive. Due to the extreme lateral separation of
species across the intertidal, there were a limited number of transects for which both
