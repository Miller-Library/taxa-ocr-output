Aggressive interactions are best established in cloning species, which compete with each
other for space (Williams 1991). A. elegantissima clones responded aggressively to
genetically distinct neighboring clones during repeated contact (Francis 1973). A.
xanthogrammica also has acrorhagi (fighting tentacles) bearing potent nematocysts which
are used in such aggressive responses (Francis 1973). Though A. xanthogrammica
individuals undergo habituation and do not show aggression towards neighbors in contact
with their tentacles for long periods of time, selective removal and replacement of
individuals shows that A. xanthogrammica do exhibit agonistic behavior to non-neighbor
anemones (Sebens 1984). It is plausible therefore, that A. xanthogrammica aggressively
exclude A. sola individuals that attempt to establish themselves in exposed areas.
A rough survey of the substrate and surrounding organisms indicated some
differences between wave-exposed and protected sites, including a higher abundance of
mussels, feather boa kelp, and barnacles in wave-exposed sites. Such differences may
affect the suitable habitats of Anthopleura congeners. Sebens (1983) identified the
dominance of Mytilus californianus prey as an indicator for abundant populations of A.
xanthogrammica. Therefore composition of prey species or competitors within a site may
also affect which Anthopleura congener dominates.
The significant differences between temperatures experienced by A.
xanthogrammica and A. sola during low tide suggest that temperature tolerance may be a
driving force behind their intertidal distributions. The consistently lower temperature
experienced by emersed A. xanthogrammica and absence of A. xanthogrammica at the
warmer A. sola site imply that that A. xanthogrammica may have a lower thermal
tolerance or at least a lower thermal optimum than A. sola. An analysis of anemones on
