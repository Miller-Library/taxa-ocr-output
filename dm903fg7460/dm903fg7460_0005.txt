of the presence of an enzyme capable of splitting the 1,3
beta linked glucose units of this carbohydrate. Tests were
performed with the three sections of the gut and at both ph
5.7 and 7.5.
2. Digestion of structural components of algae.
Hydrolytic activity capable of splitting the 1,3 beta
galactose linkage of agar and the 1,4 beta mannuronic acid
linkage of alginate was not detected in extracts from any
section of the intestinal tract. These results were support-
ed by the persistence of the marked border at its initial
level between tissue extract and carbohydrate gel within a
small piece of glass tubing. In addition, no carbohydrase
activity was detected when dilute solutions of these struc
tural polysaccharides were tested.
In testing for cellulose activity, Whatman l filter
paper was incubated in tissue extracts of appropriate sections
of gut and observed periodically for a total of 72 hours.
The intact, seemingly undamaged filter paper indicated that
in each tissue studied, no hydrolysis of the substrate was
occurring. Thus no activity capable of splitting the 1,4
beta glucose linkage was observed at pll 5.7 or 7.5. Reducing
sugar tests, performed on the above tissues, supported these
qualitative findings.
The hydrolysis of fucoidin, a sulfate ester of 1,2
alpha fucose, also did not occur in foregut, midgut, or
hepatopancreas extracts at either ph studied.
