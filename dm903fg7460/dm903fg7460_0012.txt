Figure 2 and Table 1 indicate less maltase activity
in extracts of foregut tissue. Again, hydrolysis occurs ra-
pidly at a ph of 5.7, reaching a value of 138 micrograms per
milligram of tissues after 24 hours. At ph 7.5 hydrolysis
was delayed as in the hepatopancreas until after 6 to 7 hours
of incubation and reached a total of 119 micrograms per milli-
gram tissue for a 24 hour period of incubation. It is signi-
ficant that in both tissues buffered at ph 7.5, activity
was demonstrable only when the ph of the solutions had dropped
to between 5.0 and 6.0 The increase in hydrogen ion concentra-
tion is probably due to the production of acidic produets of
carbohydrate metabolism.
Under the experimental conditions involved, the an-
terior midgut diverticula showed no maltase activity at either
pll.
Discussion
It is interesting that under the conditions of the ex
periment, no laminarase, alginase, fucoidase, cellulase, cello-
biase, agarase, or sucrase activity was observed in enzyme
extracts of foregut, midgut, and hepatopancreas. As stated
before, sources of the above carbohydrates were revealed upon
examination of gut contents. Diatoms and other microorganisms,
epiphytic on algae may constitute another source of food
obtained when materials containing the above sugars are eaten.
Moreover, the author observed P. samuelis eating partially
decayed algae, both in the field and in the laboratory. Thus,
