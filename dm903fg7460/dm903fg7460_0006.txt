3. Hydrolysis of chitin.
Chitin, a major structural component in the hard body
parts of insects and crustaceans, was prepared in a one per
cent suspension. Under the conditions of the experiment no
indication of hydrolysis was observed.with material obtained
from sections of the intestinal tract buffered at both ph's.
4. Digestion of oligosaccharides.
Tests with midgut extracts from P. samuelis indicated
absence of an enzyme capable of splitting the 1,4 beta-glucose
linkage of cellobiose or the 1,2 alpha glucose-beta fructose
linkage of sucrose. In testing for maltase activity, a slight
amount of hydrolysis of the 1,4 alpha glucose linkage was
indicated at pll 5.7. However, the amount of reducing sugar
increase over controls was below the minimum sensitivity of
the experimental procedure. The midgut was therefore considered
inactive in digesting the above three disaccharides at both ph
5.7 and 7.5 under experimental conditions. The foregut and
hepatopancreas were also found incapable of hydrolyzing suÂ¬
crose and cellobiose at the above ph's.
Table 1 and Figure 1 indicate a high degree of hydro-
lysis of the 1,4 alpha-glucose linkage of maltose by hepato
pancreas extracts. A very rapid hydrolysis of the substrate
can be noted at pll 5.7. A total of 139 micrograms of glucose
produced per milligram of tissue was found at the end of 24
hours. At pH 7.5 hydrolysis was much slower, although a
value of 186 micrograms reducing sugar per milligram of tissue
was attained after an equivalent period of incubation.
