An examination of the gut contents of Pagurus samuelis
(Stimpson, 1859) reveals red, green, and brown algae, as well
as various diatoms, bacteria and portions of tissue from other
marine animals. With such a variety of food sources, it seem-
ed of interest to determine the digestive carbohydrase activi-
ties of this animal.
The substrates used in this study are all present in
the organism's environment and thus present a potential source
of energy to P. samuelis. The survey to follow is not intended
to be a characterization of the carbohydrases of this decapod
crustacean, but rather an examination of the digestive capabil
ities necessary for splitting linkages in various structural
and reserve carbohydrates in the marine envirorment.
Materials and Methods
The following substrates were used as one percent solu-
tions without further purification: maltose (Difco Laboratories,
C.P.), cellobiose (Calif. Corp. for Biochemical Research),
and sucrose (C & H Sugar Co.). Whatman 41 filter paper served
as the substrate in testing for cellulase activity. Laminarin
and fucoidin were prepared from Fucus by the method of Black,
Dewar, and Woodward (1951-1952) and also used as one percent
solutions. One percent gels and 0.1 percent solutions of agar
(Consolidated Laboratories), and alginate (Kelco Co., commer-
cial grade) were also prepared. These gelled substrates were
solidified within glass tubing, covered with tissue extract,
