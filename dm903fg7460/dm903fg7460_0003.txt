and layered with toluene. Substrate, to determine chitinase
activity, was prepared by dissolving large pieces of chitin
(Eastman Kodak, practical grade) in 967 sulfuric acid. The
solution was then poured into a large volume of water, preci-
pitating the carbohydrate as a fine powder. After settling
for three days, the mixture was centrifuged, washed, and pre-
pared in a one percent suspension.
The alimentary canal was divided into three anatomical
sections: foregut (stomach and esophagus), midgut (excluding
caeca), and hepatopancreas.
To determine enzymatic activity, freshly collected
crabs from China Point in Monterey, California, were dissect-
ed, and the appropriate gut section excised from a number of
animals until sufficient tissue for study was obtained. The
tissue was washed several times in sea water (all visible gut
contents removed), weighed, and homogenized in a tissue grinder
with a Teflon pestle. Homogenization was performed in 0.2M
phosphate buffer at either a pll of 5.7 or 7.5. The above pro¬
cedure was carried out at 00C so as to retard any loss of ac¬
tivity due to denaturation or autolysis. After centrifuging
for fifteen minutes, an appropriate aliquot of the supernatant
was added to substrate, layered with toluene to prevent grouth
of microorganisms, and incubated at 15-160c in sea water.
Enzyme-buffer and substrate-buffer controls were run simul-
taneously with the reaction mixture. The solutions were tested
for activity at 1, 5, and 24 hours. If activity was indicated,
