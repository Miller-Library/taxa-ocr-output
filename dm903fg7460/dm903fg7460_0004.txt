an identical test was run with the number of samplings great-
ly increased.
Enzymatic activity was quantitatively determined by
testing an aliquot of the mixtures after deproteinization
with barium hydroxide and zinc sulfate (Somogyi, 1945). The
amount of reducing sugar was determined by the Somogyi method
(Somogyi, 1945 and 1952) using Nelson's colorimetric modifica-
tion (Nelson, 1944). Measurements were made on a Klett-Summerson
Photoelectric Colorimeter, using a green filter (654).
An increase in reducing sugar over the sum of the two
controls was considered as an indication of carbohydrase ac-
grerert ut
tivity. Estimations of monosaccharides perdeprewene based
on a standard curve of 10-200 micrograms of reducing sugar
specific to the carbohydrate being tested. In addition, when-
ever activity was indicated, a glucose-enzyme control was in-
serted in an identical test to determine reducing sugar con-
sumption by the crude tissue extract.
After testing foregut, midgut, and hepatopancreas for
the nine substrates mentioned above, an attempt was made to
determine if the anterior midgut diverticula (caeca) possessed
any maltase activity.
Experimental Results
Digestion of carbohydrate reserves.
Laminarin is the reserve carbohydrate of the sublitoral
brown algae and is especially abundant in Laminaria. All
tests using this polysaccharide as a substrate gave no indication
