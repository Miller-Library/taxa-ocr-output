This finding is in good agreement with Waterman (1960), who
lists the organ as the major source of digestive enzymes in
the crustaceans. Moreover, Waterman lists the ph optima for
crustacean maltase as 5.0-6.0. A more rapid hydrolysis at
pHi 5.7 than 7.5 for both foregut and hepatopancreas extracts
was observed. It was noted that the first indication of ac-
tivity by extracts buffered at pll 7.5 occurred only after the
reaction mixtures had dropped in ph to between 5.0-6.0. It
can therefore be concluded under the conditions of the exper-
iment, that the ph optimum for maltase activity in both tissues
is in the slightly acidic range.
The loss of reducing sugar demonstrable in the glucose-
enzyme controls indicates an important property of the crude
enzyme extracts. An initial consumption of glucose is indicated
by the drop in reducing sugar. Enzymes of the glycolytic
sequence or those of the pentose shunt might well explain the
initial decrease. The subsequent increase in reducing sugar
can possiblg be attributed to the hydrolysis of glycogen. present
in the crude extract. The above indicates one basic objection
to the work reported in this paper, ince. no attemptrwas made to
purify the enzymes of the gut by protein fractionation. It
is difficult to control the enzymatic reaction occurring in a
brei as crude as that obtained by the method used, since the
enzyme extract contains a wide variety of cellular enzymes
in addition to other hydrolytic enzymes. As shown by the glu-
cose enzyme control some of the oxidative enzymes present in
