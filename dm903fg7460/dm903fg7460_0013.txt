the possibility of partial digestion of carbohydrates, prior
to intake by the crab is suggested. This could allow the animal
to use otherwise indigestible food sources.
The possibility of digestion by intestinal microflora
must not be eliminated, although no attempt was made to cul-
ture microorganisms from the gut segments in this study.
Nevertheless, it seems improbable that any significant diges-
tive complement is provided by microflora (Vaterman, 1960).
Chitinase activity was not found in the three sections
of the gut. This finding is in good agreement with observa-
melt
tions made by Norman Richardson (1965) studyingmmkt induction
in this crab. His study took place simultaneously with this
survey at Hopkins Marine Station. After two weeks of observa-
tions, he reported that he had never witnessed a crab eat its
discarded carapace after molting.
Waterman (1960) has described amylase activity in other
crustaceans. Sullivan (1965) has more specifically observed
this enzyme in the hepatopancreas and foregut of P. samuelis.
Therefore, it is not surprising that an active maltase has
been demonstrated in this animal. In the studies of Sullivan
(1965), paper chromatograms of starch degradation products
showed glucose and only traces of maltose. Therefore, it ap
pears likely that preparations having amylase activity contain
maltase as well.
It is significant that the alpha glucosidase activity
in the hepatopancreas is much greater than in the foregut.
