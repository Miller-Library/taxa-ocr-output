such a mash could conceivably degrade or alter the monosac-
charides liberated by a digestive enzyme, masking its chemical
detection. As a result, the activity of a carbohydrase capable
of handling a specific carbohydrate, even if present in the
gut extract,might not be demonstrable.
Turning to the anterior midgut diverticula, an attempt
was made to determine if the organ possessed maltase activity.
The results were negative, in good agreement with Sullivan
(1965), who found the tissue lacking amylase activity.
Summary
Under the conditions of the experiment, enzyme extracts,
prepared from the hepatopancreas, foregut, and midgut of
P. samuelis were found to show no activity capable of hyÂ¬
drolyzing the following carbohydrates: laminarin, fucoidin,
cellulose, cellobiose, sucrose, agar, and alginate.
Alpha glucosidase activity was detected using maltose
in extracts of hepatopancreas and foregut, the former
producing a higher reaction rate. Both extracts reacted
more rapidly at a pll of 5.7 than at pll of 7.5. Midgut
extracts indicated no hydrolysis of the 1,4 alpha glucose
linkage.
No chitinase activity was observed in any of the sec
tions of the gut studied.
Extracts of the anterior midgut diverticula showed
no increase in reducing sugar over controls when tested
for maltase activity.
