During illumination the animal shows a characteristic exten¬
sion of pallial and cephalic tentacles, while the shell is
kept fairly close to the substrate.
Quantitative results (Table I) show that both the
percentage of animals responding to light, and the speed of
this response, is greater in Acmaea limatula than in the
other species. This species, therefore, was chosen for
continued study. It was decided that the reversal response,
if exhibited within four minutes after illumination, would
be scored as the definitive response. Responses after four
minutes were scored as negative.
fty-one Acmaea limatula were collected and tested,
of which fifty showed positive responses with a mean re¬
sponse time of 76 seconds and a standard deviation of 26
seconds. The responses of these animals to illumination
from the opposite direction was also tested. In only 7
out of 50 cases did the animal stop in his initial turning
response when the illumination was changed from one end of
the trough to the other. After an extended time those ani¬
mals which did not initially respond to the second light
would migrate away from it. These observations suggest
some process of bleaching or adaptation to illumination.
All the following studies were done with the fifty animals
which exhibited the initial positive responses, regardless
of the response to the second illumination.
