Table 3 and Figures 1, 2, and 3. In normal animals, the
response time in white, blue, and red light is biphasic.
whereas in eyeless animals responses are only seen i high
intensities in blue and white light.
The results of the last two experiments suggest the
presence of at least two pigments in Acmaea limatula, with
the eyespots probably most important at the lower intensities.
The greenish color of the eyespot might account for the fact
that the animal exhibits poor responses to green light at
lower intensities. The site of the other photoreceptor is
completely undetermined. Two possible candidates are either
the pallial tentacles, which normally are extended from
under the shell edge, or, in A. limatula, the heavily pig-
mented side of the foot. Either of these possibilities
would entail an amazing nerve network to determine the
source of light since both the pallial tentacles and the
foot would be symmetrical sites for the photoreceptors as
opposed to the normal condition of directional asymmetry
of photoreceptors.
