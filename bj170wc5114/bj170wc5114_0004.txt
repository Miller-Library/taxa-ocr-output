Various areas of the spectrum were isolated by
Corning glass filters, nos. 554, 401, and 244, correspond¬
ing respectively to blue, green, and red. Maximum trans¬
mittance with the blue filter was at 425 mu, decreasing to
10% transmittance at 500 mu, and cutting off completely
above 540 mu. The green filter transmitted maximally at
520 mu, with no transmittance below 460 mu or above 600 mu.
The red filter transmitted all wavelengths greater than 600
mu. A standard infrared absorbing filter, composed of acidic
0.5% CuSOg in distilled water, was also used. Light inten¬
sity was varied by adjustment of a rheostat.
In experiments with white light the animals were
placed 32 cm from the light source and the intensity at
each rheostat voltage setting determined with a thermopile.
Where color and intensity were varied, this thermopile
reading was used to approximate equal intensities of the
light at each color at any given voltage. This was accom¬
plished by varying the distance of the animals from the
light source, as dictated by the thermopile readings. The
difference in distance between the placement of animals in
white light and the placement in any other color never ex¬
ceeded 10 cm (in blue), and in some cases was as little as
2 cm (in red). Because of the insensitivity of the galvanom¬
eter, accurate measurements were not possible below 60 volts.
