A control experiment was then done to determine the
animal's natural response to being removed from an aquarium
and being placed, in total darkness, into the testing
apparatus. Of twenty-five animals tested in the dark,
only two showed behavior which might have been cons
rued
as a positive response had the animal been illuminated.
The above findings show that the results obtained in all
experiments are not significantly affected by the animal's
natural response to being moved, but depend only on
illumination.
In the next experiment ten animals were placed in a
dry trough to ascertain the effect on response time and
percentage of responses. Six of the ten animals showed
responses with a mean time of 112 seconds and standard
deviation of 36. This experiment shows that although
the animals do respond to light when out of water, there
is a significant decrease in both pet rate and anumber of
responding animals.
In the next experiment correlations between size
and response time were examined. Thirty animals were
chosen; ten each in size ranges less than nine om, nine
to sixteen om, and greater than sixteen cm. All three
groups showed at least nine out of ten responses, with
respective times and standard deviations of 71122, 68114,
7+0
and //.21 seconds. These results suggest no correlation
