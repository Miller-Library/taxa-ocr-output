between response to light and size of the animal.
Spectral sensitivity of the response was then in¬
vestigated, using the various color filters. The results
of this experiment, shown in Table 2, indicate equal sensi¬
tivity in the visible spectrum at the maximum intensity of
the lamp.
In the next experiment, attempts were made to
localize the photoreceptors of Acmaea. The presumptive
receptors are the eyespots, which in Acmaea limatula are
greenish in color and are located at the base of the
cephalic tentacles on the back of the head. Several at¬
tempts were made to remove the eyespots by cauterization
with a hot needle. The five out of 18 animals which
recovered completely had lost their cephalic tentacles as
a result of the operation, and hence no indications of
eyespots were apparent. These five animals were then
tested for sensitivity to light of various speotra and
atensity. The second part of Table 2 shows the eyeless
animals react significantly only to white and blue light
at maximum intensity.
The last experiment run in this study determined
the effect of varying intensity of white, blue, green,
and red light on the responses of normal and eyeless Acmaea
limatula. The results of this experiment are shown in
