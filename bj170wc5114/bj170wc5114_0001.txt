Acmaea limatula (Mollusca:Gastropoda: Prosobranchia).
The Veliger
Light responses in six species of the genus Acmaea
(Acmaea scabra, A. digitalis, A.scutum, A. pelta, A. asmi,
and A. limatula) were investigated. Acmaea limatula showed
the strongest responses to light. All responses exhibited
were negative phototaxes. Experiments varying color and
intensity indicate the eyespots of A. limatula are important
as photoreceptors in colors blue, green and red at high andh
low intensities. There is at least one other photoreceptor and
pigment, which is functional only in blue light at higher
intensities. Other observations showed no correlations
between size and response to light.-Author.
