The equalizations of intensity are, therefore, only
approximate.
Data were obtained on response (yes or no), response
time, and response time as a function of color and intensity,
The response time given is from initial illumination until
a definitive turning response (described below) was ascer¬
tained. All animals used in the experiments were allowed
to dark adapt for a minimum of one hour.

SUETS AND DISCUSSION
In the initial work it was necessary to determine a
definitive response of the limpet to illumination, such as
a turning response (Fraenkel and Gunn, 1940), or to changing
illumination, such as in the clam, Ma (Hecht, 1919). Also
it was necessary to determine whether the genus Acmaea would
exhibit sufficiently consistent responses on which to base a
study. Ten animals of the species' Acmaea pelta, Eschscholtz
1833, Acmaea scabra, Gould 1846, Acmaea scutum, Eschscholtz
1833, Acmaea digitalis, Eschscholtz 1833, Acmaea limatula,
Carpenter 1864, and Acmaea asmi, Middendorf 1849, were col¬
lected and tested for light responses.
The general response to light, when exhibited in any
species, was found to be a combination of backward movement,
sidewards movement, and a 180° reversal of orientation.
