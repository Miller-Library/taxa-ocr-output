Preliminary observations of the phototactic responses
of the limpet Acmaea limatula Carpenter, 1864, led to the
studies of spectral sensitivity reported in this paper.
Mean response times of dark-adapted animals to light of
different colors and intensities were determined, and at¬
tempts made to anatomically localize the photoreceptors.
The results suggest the possibility of at least two photo-
receptors and several visual pigments in this organism.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
The animals used were all collected at Mussel Point,
Pacific Grove, California, in the intertidal zone between
plus 2-6 ft. The observations of responses were made in a
plastic lined, water-tight wooden trough, which could be
continuously supplied with fresh sea water. At each end
of the trough, a 150 watt tungsten lamp, enclosed in a
sheet metal box, supplied the illumination. The boxes.
painted flat black to reduce reflection, had 3/4" holes
drilled in the face at the height of the lamp filaments.
Each light, connected through a rheostat, could be inde¬
pendently operated for illumination from one, or both ends
of the trough.
