SUMMARY
Light responses in six species' of the genus Acmaea
(Acmaea scabra, Acmaea digitalis, Acmaea scutum, Acmaea
pelta, Acmaea asmi, Acmaea limatula) were investigated.
The limpet, Acmaea limatula, showed the strongest responses
to light. In all cases, responses when exhibited, were of
a negative phototactic nature. Experiments varying color
and intensity indicate the eyespots of Acmaea limatula are
important as photoreceptors in colors blue, green, and red
at high and low intensities. There is at least one other
photoreceptor and pigment, which is functional only in blue
light at higher intensities.
