Carbohydrases in Armadillidium vulgare and Idothea resecata
tric Colorimeter and a red filter. The protein content of the en¬
zyme solution was determined by the Lowry method (1957).
RESULTS
The protein content of the hepatopancreatic extracts was 390
jg and 830 pg per assay for Armadillidium vulgare and Idothea re
secata, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the time course of hydrolysis of starch by he¬
patopancreatic extracts from the two animals. After 12 hours, the
extracts from Idothea resecata produced hydrolysis of 74 of the
theoretical maximum expected with this substrate. In the same in-
terval, the Armadillidium vulgare extract produced 59% hydrolysis.
Figure 2 shows the time course of hydrolysis of maltose by he¬
patopancreatic extracts. After 12 hours, the extract from Idothea
resecata produced hydrolysis of 57% of the theoretical maximum ex-
pected with this substrate. Armadillidium vulgare produced 65%.
Figure 3 shows the time course of hydrolysis of sucrose. Af¬
ter 12 hours, the extract from Idothea resecata produced hydrolysis
of 36% of the theoretical maximum expected, and Armadillidium vul-
gare extract produced 23% hydrolysis.
No hydrolytic enzyme activity for melibiose, cellobiose, lac¬
tose, or sodium alginate was detected by this method.
