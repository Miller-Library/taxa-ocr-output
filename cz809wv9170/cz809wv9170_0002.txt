Carbohydrases in Armadillidium vulgare and Idothea resecata
ABSTRACT
Crude extracts of the hepatopancreas from Armadillidium
vulgare and Idothea resecata were investigated for hydrolytic ac-
tivity using the following substrates: soluble starch, maltose,
lactose, melibiose, cellobiose, sucrose, and sodium alginate. AcÂ¬
tivity with respect to starch, maltose, and sucrose was demon-
strated. No activity for lactose, melibiose, cellobiose, or sodium
alginate was detected.
