Carbohydrases in Armadillidium vul
reseca
INTRODUCTION
The organisms belonging to the order Isopoda show a wide range
of habitat extending from the marine to the terrestrial. Marine
and terrestrial isopods differ with respect to diet. Complex car-
bohydrases are conspicuous components of these diets. One might
expect, then, that two different species of isopods, one marine
and the other terrestrial, would possess different digestive en¬
zymes for the hydrolysis of these complex materials. A study of
some of the carbohydrases belonging to the marine isopod, Idothea
resecata, and the terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare, was
carried out. These two species were chosen because of their re¬
lative abundance in the intertidal regions near Monterey, Calif-
ornia and in the neighboring grasslands. Both species appear to
be omnivorous. Previous studies on the carbohydrases of these
animals have shown the presence of amylase, maltase, and a 8-glu¬
cosidase hydrolyzing arbutin and salacin in Armadillidium vulgare
(Newcomer, 1952). Enzyme assays for the detection of amylase,
maltase, sucrase, lactase, melibiase, cellobiase, and alginase re¬
sulted in the findings reported here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The hepatopancreas of Idothea resecata and Armadillidium vul-
gare were obtained by dissections and homogenized. Distilled wa-
