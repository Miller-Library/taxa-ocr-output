INTRODUCTION
Much work has been accomplished concerning the amount and distribu¬
tion of organic material in marine sediments off-shore and far from shore,
but relatively little work has been done on the distribution of organic
matter on sandy beaches except with respect to specific faunal distribu¬
tions or as noted as an adjunct to wave action studies. It is generally
known that "accumulation of debris in an intertidal area depends on
wave exposure, water currents, slope of the beach, coarseness of sand,
and the amount of vegetation in nearby areas." (Dahl, 1953). The material
deposited ranges in size from large pieces of wrack to dissolved organic
matter. I attempted to quantitatively measure the distribution of the
small particulate and sand-adhered organic matter including both detri¬
tus and microorganisms on a sandy beach. From the distribution of this
organic matter, I hoped to gain some insight into the amount and type
of organic matter contributed to the beach with time.
