RESULTS
The front beach is characterized by coarse sand and a relatively
steep slope of about 14%, while the back beach is characterized by fine
sand and a gentle slope of approximately 6%. Off-shore kelp beds sur-
round both beaches. The sand on both beaches is well-sorted with ODø
values of .05 to .50 and SKgø values from -.1 to +.05.
Distribution of organic carbon across the beach showed no sig¬
nificant difference as determined by the "t" test.
Variation in organic carbon content with tidal height is plotted
in figures 2 and 3. In general the back beach had a 60-80% higher content
than the front beach. Mean organic carbon content increased with
decreasing tidal height for both beaches. The greatest differences
between the organic carbon content levels of consecutive stations were
observed for the front beach at low tidal heights, for the back beach
at higher tidal heights. The line separating the tidal heights of
pronounced and moderate increases between stations was approximately
2.3 feet or the mean higher low water line for both beaches.
The means of the organic content of the wet sand samples were
always greater than those of the "dry" sand samples. This difference
was significant for the front beach at the 95% confidence level. The
difference was not significant for the back beach. The level of or¬
ganic content at stations 4 were significatnly different when the two
beaches were compared, while levels at stations O were nearly identical.
The composition of the organic material was similar for all the
