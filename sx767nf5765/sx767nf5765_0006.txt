samples fractionated. The approximate ratio of carbohydrate to proÂ¬
tein to lipid was 9:2:1. Carbohydrate comprised about 75% of the total
organic matter extracted. The percentage of the estimated total organic
matter accounted for by the extraction procedure ranged from 39% to 102%,
with an average of 60%. The extraction procedure was not meant to be
exhaustive. Therefore, the results reflect only the gross composition.
