ABSTRACT
Iwo contrasting beaches characterized by heavy and light wave
action showed increasing sand organic carbon content with decreasing
tidal height.
Sand samples collected when wet and when dry from identical sites
showed significant differences in organic carbon content levels.
Evidence against the possibility that a greater number of meiofauna
was present in the wet sand samples suggest that this difference is
due to a direct contribution of organic material from the sea.
