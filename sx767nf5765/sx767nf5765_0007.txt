DISCUSSTON
The fractionation procedure utilized indicated no real difference in
composition of the organic material at different tidal heights or between
wet and dry samples. The lack of difference tends to rule out the possiÂ¬
bility of migration of meiofauna as the cause of the increase in organic
content in the wet samples, as meiofauna contain a considerably higher
protein content than was detected. The results suggest that the higher
organic content of wet sand is due to a direct contribution of organic
matter from the water. The fall in the organic content of wet sand with
time may be due to a number of factors including consumption by beach
inhabitants and decrease by percolation deeper into the sand. Water
drainage may be expected to be a major factor leading to the difference
between the two beaches studies. The back beach would be expected to
have more detritus clogging its smaller interstital spaces, (Eltringham,
1971) leading to retardation of water loss. This would be consistent
with the finding that an insignificant difference between wet and dry
sand organic content was found for the back beach, while the front
beach showed a difference that was significant.
