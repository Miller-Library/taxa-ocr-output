Polyssacharides, DNA, and RNA were assayed by the Dische-Stumpf method,
(Stumpf, 1947), lipid as organic carbon by HoSO-dichromate oxidation,
and protein by the Lowry method (Lowry, 1951).
Pieces of organic material that were larger than sand grain size were
removed from the sand samples prior to extraction or analysis.
