side of the tank.
Leptasterias pusilla were observed to eat three Cyanoplax
1 om in length over a four week period.
Within the small aquaria Patiria miniata were observed
to partially eat three Cyanoplax, but in the larger outdoor
tanks no predation occurred, which suggests that Patiria is
not a significant predator under natural conditions.
The two carnivorous snails Thais emarginata and Acanthina
spirata, and the hermit crabs Pagurus spp. were all tested as
potential predators for four weeks and no predation was
observed.
DISCUSSION
This study indicates that Pisaster ochraceus is an
important predator on Cyanoplax hartwegii under artificial
conditions. Yet, in the intertidal zone densities of 30
Cyanoplax/m2 can be observed. These high densities are
found at a tidal height of +3 to +4 ft, thus they are
typically covered by water for only seven hours a day, and
consequently are potential prey for Pisaster only a fraction
of the day, since this predator feeds mostly underwater.
However the present investigation indicates that the presence
of Pelvetia may be a more important deterrant to predation than
the short exposure period. Perhaps Pisaster avoids Pelvetia
because the algal mass blocks firm attachment or perhaps the
