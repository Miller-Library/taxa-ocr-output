the gulls, while Moore found plates of 62 individuals of the
more exposed and abundant chiton, Nuttallina californiga
(Reeve, 1847). Thus there is no indication that this common
foraging bird feeds on the locally available Cyanoplax.
LABORATORY STUDIES: METHODS AND RESULTS
In order to test for predation under controlable conditions.
Cyanoplax and potential predators were kept in aquaria both
in the presence and in the absence of algal covering. One
set of experiments was conducted in indoor aquaria measuring
60 x 30 x 30 cm, and provided with a constant flow of
unfiltered seawater at 14°C. The natural day-night cycle was
maintained, occasionally being interrupted at night with
artificial lights. Two rocks, one bare, one covered with
Pelvetia fastigiata, each with a surface area of about 300
cm", were placed at opposite ends of each aquarium, on a 2 cm
layer of coarse sand and shell fragments. On each rock three
Cyanoplax were placed: 1 small (1-2 cm), 1 medium (2-3 cm).
and I large (3-4 cm). Potential predators, in various
densities, were added to the middle of the aquaria.
Observations were made at 12 hour intervals, and dead or
missing chitons were replaced immediately. Chitons found on
the bottom of the rock, or on the side of the tank were
placed back on top of their assigned rock.
Further tests were made in two 1.5 m2 screened-off
sections of outdoor cement tanks containing running seawater
at a depth of 0.5 m, and at 1541°C. In each section a Pelvetia
