Predation on Cyanoplax

covered rock and a bare rock, each about 30 cm in diameter,
was suspended about 2 cm from the bottom but totally submerged.
This was done to insure that chitons placed on the rocks
would remain there; starfish then placed in the tank could
reach and climb up on the rocks without apparent difficulty.
Six chitons (2 large, 2 medium, and 2 small) were placed on
each rock. Eight Pisaster ochraceus were then added to each
section and the number of Cyanoplax consumed was monitored daily
for one week. Patiria miniata was also studied with identical
conditions and methods.
A list of species tested and a quantitative summary of
the results can be found on Table 1.
Of all animals tested, Pisater ochraceus was the most
voracious in the small aquaria' they ate an average of .75
chiton/day. There was a preference for chitons over 2 cm.
and for those on bare rocks (both results significant at P(.05
chi-square test). No chitons were taken from a rock covered
by Pelvetia. In the large tanks, within one week 12 (7 large.
5 medium and O small) from the bare rock and one medium
chiton from the rock covered by Pelvetia fastigiata, were
taken.
Over a 12 day period using one large Hemigrapsus nudus,
three chitons were eaten.
During a two week test, three Pachygrapsus crassipes
ate three chitons. Both Hemigrapsus and Pachygrapsus may
have eaten chitons which had moved from their rock to the
