Predation on Cyanoplax
page 9
Leptasterias pusilla (on chitons 1 cm)
Pisaster ochraceus )))
Pachygrapsus crassipes (occasional)
Hemigrapsus nudus (occasional)
The algal covering of Pelvetia fastigiata is a protective
barrier from predation against Pisaster ochraceus, and
possibly from birds; all the other potential predators
tested showed no preference for chitons on bare rocks as o
opposed to those covered by Pelvetia.
