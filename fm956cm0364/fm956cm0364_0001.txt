Predation on Cyanoplax
page 2
INTRODUCTION
On California rocky shores Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter,
1855) occurs in higher tidepools, damp crevices, and under
dense stands of algae at intertidal heights of +1.5 to +4.0
ft above mean lower low water (Andrus and Legard, 1974).
In the Monterey Bay region the densest populations (up to
30/m*) are found on rocks covered by heavy beds of the
brown alga, Pelvetia fastigiata (J.G. Agardh) DeToni, at
a tidal height of about +3 to +3.5 ft, in areas protected
from strong wave action. Few erect plants grow under the
Pelvetia cover, but a film of encrusting red algae and
microscopic species are generally present.
According to Robb (1974), in this habitat Pelvetia is a
major food of C. hartwegii. In addition, Pelvetia might be
expected to offer protection to the chitons against wave
surge and desiccation, and to provide an excellent screen
against predators. Preliminary field observations carried
out at low and intermediate tides both day and night revealed
no instances of predation on C. hartwegii but disclosed a
number of species deemed potential predators including the
carnivorous snails Thais emarginata (Deshayes, 1839) and
Acanthina spirata (Blainville, 1832), the hermit crabs
Paqurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857) and Pagurus granosimanus
(Stimpson, 1859), the crabs Pahcygrapsus crassipes (Randall,
1839) and Hemigrapus nudus (Dana, 1851), the sea stars
