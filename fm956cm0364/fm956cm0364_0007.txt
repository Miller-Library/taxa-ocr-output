Predation on Cyanoplax

movement of the fronds with the waves is itself a deterrant.
Despite the predation found in the laboratory by
Pachygrapsus crassipes and Hemigrapsus nudus, they are
probably not major predators on Cyanoplax hartwegii.
This
is supported by Hiatt (1948) who ranked the feeding preferences
of Pachygrapsus in order of decreasing importnaces as:
1) live algae, 2) detritus, and 3) littoral animals, on
which it is chiefly a scavenger and less often a predator.
Hiatt also reports that Hemigrapsus subsists primarily on
detritus and infrequently on algal fronds.
Predation by Leptasterias pusilla, Pachygrapsus crassipes
and Hemigrapsus nudus was low in the indoor aquaria.
However, if this rate is characteristic of natural predation,
the effect on the population of the slow growing chitons
may be important.
Cyanoplax hartwegii is well adapted to the Pelvetia
fastigiata community. Pelvetia offers an abundant food
source, protection from wave surge and desiccation and from
Pisaster ochraceus.
SUMMARY
According to both the experiments and field observations,
potential predators on Cyanoplax hartwegii are ranked as
follows:
