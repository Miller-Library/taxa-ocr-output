Predation on Cyanoplax
DeBevoise
removed, exposing half of the Cyanoplax population. A
common predator of intertidal molluscs, Pisaster ochraceus,
was used as the test predator. Four Pisaster were added to
each side of the test rock 30 minutes before the oncoming
tide washed over the rock. During the next tidal cycle, any
Pisaster that left the rock was replaced; this happened on
eight occasions on the side where Pelvetia remained and only
twice on the bare side. During the tidal cycle, ten chitons
from the bare side and only two from the Pelvetia side were
eaten (a significant difference; p(.05, Chi-squared test).
This finding supports the concept that Pelvetia offers
Cyanoplax protection.
Although numerous Tegula sp. and various Acmaea spp. were
present, none were eaten, even though it has been demonstrated
by Landenberger (1968), Mausey (1966), and Paine (1969)
that both species are eaten by Pisaster at a higher rate than
chitons.
odetermine the effect of Larus occidentalis, the
western gull, on the Cyanoplax population, a survey of Granite
Point within Pt. Lobos State Reserve, Monterey County, California
was made in conjunction with Moore's study (1974). The
study site and the procedures are described by Moore (1974).
Cyanoplax was conspicuous only within an area approximately
20 mx 3 m which had scattered dense layers of Pelvetia; its
density there was estimated to be 4 Cyanoplax/m2. No Cyanoplax
shell plates were found in over 100 regurgfitation pellets of
