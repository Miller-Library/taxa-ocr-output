Predation on Cyanoplax

Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835), Patiria miniata (Brandt, 1835)
and Leptasterias pusilla (Fisher, 1911), and the western gull
Larus occidentalis (Audubon, 1839). The present investigation
posed the questions: 1) do some or all of these organisms
prey on C. hartwegii, and 2) does the Pelvetia bed habitat
provide significant protection for the chitons against some
or all of these predators? To answer these questions, predation
on naturally occurring populations and on populations
situated where extant Pelvetia was removed, was studied in
the field. Concurrent with these field observations, artificial
test situations were set up in laboratory aquaria to induce
interaction between potential predators and Cyapoplax. I
herein report on these studies, conducted in the spring of
1974.
FIELD STUDIES: METHODS AND RESULTS
A Pelvetia fastigiata covered granite rock with a surface
area of about
1.5 meterse was chosen as a site to study
the role of Pelvetia as a deterrant to predation on Cyanoplax.
The rock was surrounded by sand at a tidal height of about t3
ft and was located off of a protected point of the Hopkins
Marine Station property in Pacific Grove, California. To
the natural population of 25 Cyanoplax was added 30 additional
Cyanoplax. After the population stabilized for five days to
45 chitons, all the Pelvetia from one side of the rock was
