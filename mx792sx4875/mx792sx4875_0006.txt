To see if Tricolia pulloides would lay egg clutches consistently
under laboratory conditions, 2 fingerbowls of 25 snails each were kept
with 6 - 8 clumps of Phodoglossum affine free of any previous egg
clutches and other organisms, at about 14'C. Water was changed daily,
and the R. affine fronds were checked daily for eggs. All new egg
masses found were measured, and the eggs were counted. The egg clutches
were then trimmed from the algal frond, placed in a depression slide
with a cover slip and examined under a compound microscope for develop¬
mental stage. The time and stage of development were noted. These egg
masses were then put in fresh seawater in fingerbowls and kept at 14°C.
The seawater was changed twice daily, and five selected clutches were
checked microscopically twice daily for general developmental features.
Three other clutches were checked every half hour each day, from the
1 - 16 cell stage to hatching, to determine accurately the time scale
of development under laboratory conditions.
Hatchlings from these clutches were kept on fronds of Rhodoglossum
affine under the same conditions in the laboratory as those used for
observation of clutches. The diet of the hatchlings was determined by
lightly squashing the bodies of five-day-old snails in 1 drop of 30%
corn syrup between a slide and coverslip and viewing them under a com¬
pound microscope. Hatchlings were best transferred individually by a
pipette.

individuals sampled from both diet studies. Juvenile animals are not
adequately represented in the sample considered, but for animals over
