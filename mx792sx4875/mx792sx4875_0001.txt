Diet and Reproductive Biology of the
Rocky Intertidal Prosobranch Gastropod
icolia pulloides
Although Tricolia pulloides (Carpenter, 1865) is a common inhabi¬
tant in the intertidal region on California rocky shores, it is often
overlooked, probably due to its small size. Very little is known of
its natural history. A related British species, Tricolia pullus (Linnaeus,
758) has been extensively studied. T. pullus feeds on diatoms (Fretter
& Graham, 1962); it is dioecious and sheds its eggs singly into water
where they develop into free-swimming trochophore larvae (Lebour, 1937;
Fretter, 1955).
The present study of Tricolia pulloides was conducted on the popu¬
lation in the midtide zone dominated by the red algae Rhodoglossum
gan
ine (Harv.) Kyl. and Gigaltina papillata (C. Ag.) J. Ag. at Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California, in the period April to June, 1979.
The objectives of the investigation were twofold. The first was to
characterize the diet of T. pulloides, answering the questions: What
is it eating? Where is it obtaining food? How is it obtaining food?
When is it eating? The second objective was to characterize the repro¬
ductive biology of T. pulloides by studying the adult population, the
egg masses deposited by females.
