2 mm long the sample is considered representative of the population.
The ratio of males to female is 1:1.2 indicating roughly equal fre¬
quency of sexes in the sample. Female snails averaged significantly
larger than the males (p°.001); the mean shell length for females was
3.14 mm (n = 28), and for males was 2.62 mm (n = 25). The smallest
female, at 2.0 mm, had immature oocytes in its ovary, but moving sperm
was found in the testis of the male at the same size.
The number of eggs counted in thebvary of a female ranged from
O to 206 eggs, with a mean of 56.5 for 30 females (Fig. 3). The number
of eggs in an ovary tends to increase with the size of the female, but
the variability at any particular size is great.
Fifty snails kept in fingerbowls in the laboratory at 14 C laid
57 egg clutches over a 6 day period. The number of eggs per clutch
ranged from 11 to 104 with a mean of 32.5. These eggs in newly laid
clutches appeared identical to those in the ovaries of mature female
ricolia pulloides. These eggs are light yellow, opaque, show a
gradient in distribution of yolk, and each is enclosed in a colorless
transparent capsule. The eggs and egg capsules are approximately
150 um and 180 um in diameter, respectively. Generally, the eggs are
laid in a compact, sinuous ribbon which is coated with a clear jelly.
The completed egg clutches are disc-shaped, average about 2.0 x 2.5 mm
in size, and are attached by one flat surface to a plant. They are
most generally found on a concave furface at the bifurcation of a
frond on such red algal species as Rhodoglossum affine, Gig
tina
apillata, and Gig
tina leptorhynchos, but some were found on Cryp¬
tosiphonia woodii which does not have a concave surface.
