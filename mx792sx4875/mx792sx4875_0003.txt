Some radulae were then dipped in 70% alcohol and allowed to dry thoroughly
for scanning electron microscopy; they were watched under a dissecting
microscope as they dried, for radulae tend to curl and fold as they
dry, minimizing good viewing areas. Other radulae were placed in a
drop of water on a clean glass slide, for viewing under a compound
microscope.
Results Between 90 and 95% of the contents of stomachs of snails
from all five types of algae consisted of pennate diatoms. Five to ten
percent of the gut contents consisted of small sponge spicules, uniden¬
tifiable organic matter termed detritus, and small pieces of epiphytic
algae including coccoid blue-greens, Dermocarpa sp., Collinsiella
tuberculata S. & G., and Florideophycids. No one of these catagories
comprised more than 1 - 2% of the total diet. The diatoms and other
algae in the gut were browsed as epiphytes on the surfaces of macro¬
algae. T. pulloides was never found feeding on encrusting algae, rocks,
or exposed surfaces.
Figure I shows the results of sampling the gut contents of the
ricolia population over a seven hour period centering on low tide.
Quantity of food in the gut is shown in terms of number of large diatoms
counted in squashes of the stomachs of the 5 snails sampled each hour.
The population showed great variability, and the differences between
sample means are not significant, but diatoms were most abundant in the
stomachs at low tide.
Scanning electron micrographs of the radulae of T
colia pulloides
confirm the observations of Tryon (1888) in the original species
