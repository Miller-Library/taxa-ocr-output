to develop or developed abnormally. Under intense light and moderate
heat, embryos were seen to rotate much more frequently within the egg
membrane. At low tide on warm days the egg clutches may sometimes be
exposed to increased temperature, possibly affecting mortality and
rate of development.
Tricolia pulloides develops directly and lacks swimming trochophore
and veliger stages. In contrast, the British T. pullus develops via
a free-swimming trochophore larvae (Lebour, 1937). Direct development,
bypassing a pelagic stage, is comparatively uncommon among prosobranchs
(Webber, 1977). The occurrence of direct development here may help
account for the somewhat patchy distribution of T. pulloides in the
intertidal. Where dispersal is probably mostly by creeping, local
populations may develop. Further investigation of this would be
desirable.
