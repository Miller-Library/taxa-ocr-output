Food Studies
Material
& Methods To determine what Tricolia pulloides was
eating and where the food was obtained, 5 snails were collected from
each of 5 species of red algae: Gigartina papillata, Gigartina lepto-
rhynchos J. Ag., Ga
troclonium coulteri (Harv.) Kyl., Rhodoglossum
affine, and
siphonia woodii (J. Ag.) J. Ag. All collections were
made at or below the 1.5 ft. tidal level. The larger, more conspicuous
snails were collected, without scrutinizing the algae for juvenile
individuals. Each sample was placed directly in 5% formalin. The
stomach of each snail was dissected out, and the contents placed on a
slide in a drop of 30% corn syrup under a cover slip for viewing under
a compound microscope. Stomach contents were identified with the
assistance of Dr. Isabella Abbott. The large pennate diatoms present
in the preparations were counted; the relative abundance of other materials
was estimated.
To determine when Tricolia pulloides was eating over the tidal
cycle, hourly samples, each of 5 snails, were collected from a hori¬
zontal rock face covered with Rhodoglossum affine, about 0.5 ft above
zero tide level. Samples were taken over a seven hour period. The
samples were preserved and gut contents analyzed as before.
Radulae were prepared by removing the buccal mass and teasing free
the radulæein sea water under the dissecting microscope. To remove any
excess tissue, radulae were dipped in 100% HCl for 5 - 15 seconds and
immediately placed in seawater, where any excess tissue was teased away.
