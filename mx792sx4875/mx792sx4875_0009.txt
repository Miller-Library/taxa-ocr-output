after hatching, shell aperature has widened with new shell growth. The
body tissues are still relatively clear except for the posterior parts
of the visceral hump which are yellow and darker green. New shell is
more darkly tinted and transluscent.
Discussion The size discrepancy between males and females is of
real interest. If size is mainly a function of age, and the fact that
males are smaller than the females, this suggests the possibility that
Tricolia pulloides is protandric and changes sex from male to female at a
certain age. The existence of the 2.0 mm long female tends to mefute
this. Another possibility is that females do indeed grow larger
(perhaps faster) than males, and the immature males and females occur
inmore secluded habitats than do the adults which were collected.
Validity of these ideas must be substantiated by further study.
Since most of the females examined contined more eggs than the
number found in the average clutch (32), and a large variability exists
in the number of large eggs in females of a particular length, it seems
likely that a female does not necessarily deposit all her eggs in one
clutch. Instead, she may lay two or more clutches for a given group
of mature oocytes.
ricolia pulloides appears to have many features suiting it for
laboratory studies. Egg clutches are easily obtained in the laboratory.
No special conditions were required to stimulate egg-laying. The egg
is large and yolky, and early development is quick and easy to follow.
Development from eggglaying (fertilization?) to hatching takes only
about 7 days at 14'C. At room temperatures, about 23Â°C, many eggs failed
