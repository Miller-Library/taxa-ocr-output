The time schedule of development, based on external morphology of
the larvae, is shown in Figure 4. The time of fertilization is unknown.
The first 6 cleavage stages each lasted from 0.5 - 1 hour. A few eggs
showed abortive development; they became white and took on a granulated
appearance after a few hours. By 24 hours the larval shell appeared
pesterior
complete. At about this time the tissues at the end of the shell began
to turn light green. The soft body parts pull away from the interior
of the shell, anteriodorsally by 1.8 days, and soon portions are seen
extending from the aperture of the shell. Pedal cilia and the operÂ¬
culium were formed by 2.3 days. Within two hours muscular contraction
of the foot was seen. By 3.1 days the tentacles were present, and,
shortly thereafter, black eyespots appeared. Contraction of the body
into the shell and closure of the operculum were seen at 4.3 days. Soon
the embryos begin occasional rotations, crawling on the interior of the
transparent egg capsule. Frequency of rotation increased just prior to
hatching, and the jelly coating began to dissolve away about this time.
At 7 days the embryos hatched as miniature, young snails with nearly
clear, planospiral shells, with light green pigment concentrated in the
area of the visceral hump. The maximum diameter of the shell at hatching
is 240 um.
After hatching, the hatchlings move out onto the algal frond where
they can cling tenaciously from the very start. They are not swept away
by a jet of water forcefully extruded from an eyedropper pipette. Snails
knocked over maintain position by a mucus thread extruded by the foot.
Whole mounts of 5 day old snails crushed under a cover slip show that
the young are eating primarily small, naviculoid diatoms. By five days
