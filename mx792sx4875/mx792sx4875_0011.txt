1. The diet and reproductive biology of Tricolia pulloides was
investigated during the period April - June, 1979 at Mussel Point,
Pacific Grove, California.
2. T. pulloides feeds primarily on pennate diatoms grazed as epiphytes
from the surfaces of algal fronds; small particles of detritus and
pieces of other epiphytes are probably picked incidentally.
3. T. pulloides contains food in its gut at both high and low tide.
4. T. rulloidesshows roughly a 1:l ratio of males and females. Females,
averaging 3.14 mm in length, are very significantly larger than the
males, averaging 2.62 mm in length, though the smallest females are
much smaller than the largest males.
5. Females carry up to 206 and average 56.5 yellow yolky oocytes.
Up to 104 eggs, averaging 32.5 eggs per clutch, are laid in a
sinuous ribbon, coated with a clear jelly. Egg clutches are
located on algal fronds.
6. Eggs cleave spirally and develop directly within 7 days into clear,
miniature snails that feed on naviculoid diatoms and cling tenaciously
to algal fronds with the aid of mucus threads.
