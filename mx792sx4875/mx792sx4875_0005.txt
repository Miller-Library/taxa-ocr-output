Materials and Methods From the snails collected during diet
experiments, data were taken on (1) the shell length from tip of spire
to base of aperture, (2) the sex of the snail based on examination of
the gonads, and (3), if the snails were female, the number of mature
eggs within the ovary. Sexes are easily determined. In females the
large yellow eggs are borne in a translucent gonad, and in males the
gonads are mottled and white. In the smallest animals a piece of the
gonad was viewed under the compound microscope for presence of developing
sperm or oocytes.
The egg masses of Tricolia pulloideg were first identified as
belonging to this species by noting the great similarity between the
large eggs in the ovaries of ripe females and the large eggs in certain
egg masses common on plants inhabited by T. pulloides. Observations of
egg laying and hatching in the lab confirmed the identification.
Yellow egg clutches were collected in the field from areas of dense
ricolia pulloides populations. Data were kept on the location of the
egg masses on the algal frond, the type of alga bearing the egg mass,
the diameter of the egg mass, and the number of eggs contained within
the egg mass. The algal fronds bearing masses were then maintained in
5-inch fingerbowls of seawater at about 14'C. The water was changed twice
daily. The samples were checked daily under a dissecting microscope for
stage of development.
