description. The central or rachidian tooth is curved, smooth, and
(Piates1,2)
without cusps, overlapping the base of the first medial tooth.A The
latter has a central cusp and denticles to both sides. This appears to
overlap and buttress the second medial. Simil√•rly, the second medial
has a large central cusp with denticles to both sides. Third and fourth
medials have denticles to the lateral side of one large pointed cusp.
Thirty-seven lateral teeth extend out to the side; they are heavily
(Plate 3)
denticulated and overlapping.A The radulae of T. pulloides appears to
be a composite of the radulae of T. pullus and T. compta (Robertson,
1955).
Discussion The diet studies show that Tricolia pulloides skims
the surface of macroalgae taking very largely pennate diatoms. Chun
(1979) has noted large populations of sessile pennate diatoms on
ungrazed, distal areas of fronds of Rhodoglossum affine, and noted a
significant reduction in these populations through grazing by T. pul
loides and other small herbivorous gastropods. Further, when submerged
at high tide, T. pulloides tends to move out to these distal areas of
algal fronds (Foster, 1979).. The 5 - 10% of the diet not consisting of
diatoms can probably be considered incidental. Particulate matter and
epiphytic algae also occur in the areas browsed for diatoms and may be
rasped up unintentionally. No single component comprises a large
portion of the incidentals.
Although Figure 1 shows more food in the stomach of T. pulloides
at the lowest tidallevel, the differences in mean gut content shown are
not significant. Some food was found in the stomachs at each sampling
