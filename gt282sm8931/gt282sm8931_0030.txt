Figure 6: Sensitivity of Tigriopus to light at various
intensities, as measured by the response to the onset
of illumination. Absolute sensitivity is given by the
magnitude of the response, as measured by percent effect,
E, where:
(see Fia ta, page 24
E S   x 100.
Relative sensitivity to light, S, is given by absolute sensitivÂ¬
ity corrected for intensity, I, in terms of relative percent
effect: S-E/I. This is a measure of the relative magnitude
of response per quanta of light stimulus. This adjusts for the
fact that at higher intensities, there is more light to produce
an effect.
