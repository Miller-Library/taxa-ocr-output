surface of a tide pool on a bright day. The intensities studied, however, are by
no means completely unnatural, since: (1) the range observed in the field extends
from less than 0.002 watts/m at night to around 200 watts/m on a bright day,
and the range of intensities studied is well within this, (2) at least half the time,
tide pools are more dimly illuminated in the field than under conditions studied
in the laboratory ,(3) at least two times a day, at dawn and dusk, tide pools are
exposed to the intensities studied, and (4) the sensitivity to light in crustaceans
can extend well below the range of intensities studied, to 10 2 or 10  watts/m
(Waterman 1939).
On a clear day, parellel light rays from the sun clearly provide a directional
source of illumination to tide pool inhabitants. Light from a laboratory
source is not composed of parllel rays, and consequently may present a different
kind of stimulus to an experimental animal. In order to distinquish a response to a
to light intensity gradientfrom a response to a directional light source in
Tigriopus, attempts were made to provide as nearly a nondirectional source as
possible; however, the at sence of directionality was in no way completely
acheived.
Since light intensity decreases inversely with the square of the distance
from the source, the intensity of light at the surface of a tide pool is very
water
nearly the same as the intensity reaching the bottom, unless the tide pool is very
turbid. In the atsience of vertical intensity gradients, copepods may orient to
horizontal ones produced by shadows. In the laboratory, however, light intensity
attenuates rapidly through a distance of water. Consequently, a horizontal gradient
was used in these studies to more closely approximate what Tigriopus might encounter
in nature.
From these studies, there is evidence that kinetic and tactic mechanisms are
both involved in the response of Tigriopus to light, that Tigriopus can exhibit
