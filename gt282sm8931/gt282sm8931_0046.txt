Figure 12: The mean values for all observations as a function
of distance from the brightest end of the trough and light
intensity. In the top graph, the range and standard
deviations are indicated. A regression line is drawn for
the lower graph, excluding the observations made within
two cm of each end, which are indicated by (0). The Pearson
correlation coefficient is given for each regression with
the probability, p. that there is no correlation.
