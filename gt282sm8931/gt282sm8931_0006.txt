basic procedure given in "General Materials and Methods." The response was
essentially similar in each instance; the animals started at the same level of
activity, displayed a sudden decrease in activity of the same magnitude followed
by a gradual increase, and reached the same level after fifteen minutes of
illumination. The response to light considered here, then, does not depend
significantly on the past light history of Tigriopus, at least beyond the last
fifteen minutes.
Does the Response to Illumination Depend on Intensity?
In order the role of intensity in the light response, a group
of randomly sexed copepods were exposed sequentially to four light intensities
from 1.95 to 0.05 watts/m', in order of decreasing magnitude, preceded in each case
by fifteen minutes of darkness, following the basic procedure given in "General
Materials and Methods." The results are shown in figure 4a and b. The qualitative
nature of the response is the same in each case, but there are some important
quantitative differences related to intensity. The activity is shown to increase on
balance with light intensity, when compared after fifteen minutes exposure to light
(figures ba and b). This type of behavior, where a locomotory response increases with
light intensity, has been observed in Branchipus (Haidinger 1844), and
Daphnia magna (Koller 1928).
The variation in swimming velocity is large, and skewed toward low speeds,
approximating a Poisson-type distribution, as might be expected by the periodic
pauses and bursts of swimming characteristic of Tigriopus.
Studies in other invertebrates suggest that responses to change in light
intensity may be governed largely by the sensitivity of the eye over various intensity
ranges and the capacity of the eye to adapt to intensity (Fraenkel and Gunn 1961). The
fraction of Tigriopus affected by the stimulus is indicative of the animal's
