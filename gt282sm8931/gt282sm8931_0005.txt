all measurements were made from the anterior end. When motion was too slight
to permit measurement every half second, measurements were made as often as
possible.
All experiments were performed at 2111 C and in a salinity of 35 ppt.

How Does Tigriopus Respond to the Onset of Illumination?
Before determining the effect of any light stimulus on Tigriopus, it was
first necessary to distinguish the effect of turning on the light from the effect
of the light itself. An experiment was performed, employing the procedure described
in "General Materials and Methods," and using an intensity around 1.1 watts/m.
The light stimulus was presented, and activity was measured immediately and at
intervals for nearly two hours thereafter. The results are shown in figure 2.
When Tigriopus is exposed to light after a period of darkness, a marked decrease
in activity occurs immediately, reaching a minimum within two minutes, from which
the animals recover to previous activity levels. Abrupt illumination has been
found to arrest the swimming movement of other copepod species as well (Rose 1925).

Levels of activity do not change rapidly after

the state of activity characteristic of a given intensity after a period of
adjustment.
Does the Response to Illumination Depend on the Past Light History of Tigriopus?
Before comparing the activity of Tigriopus at various light intensities
presented in sequence, it was necessary to establish that the light response does
not depend on thehistory of illumination of the experimental animals. The experiment
illustrated in figure 3 compares the response of a group of copepods after two
identical exposures of light separated by fifteen minutes of darkness, using the
