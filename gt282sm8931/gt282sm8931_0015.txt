is clearly directional in the field, but in experiments using diffuse light, swimÂ¬
ming is undirected; the response observed is purely kinetic, and yet in that
aspect it follows closely the time course of the field response.
Tigriopus also appears to be both positively phototactic at low intensities
and negatively phototactic at high intensities. This behavior has been reported in
another copepod species, Labidocera (Herter, 1927). Other investigators have found
a progressively stronger positive phototaxis in Tigriopus to overhead lighting as
intensity is increased to 16 watts/m that diminishes at higher intensities
(H. Townsend, pers. comm.). The significance of this trend may lie in the control
of diurnal migration, or in the capacity of Tigriopus to seek a preferred isolume
that is optimal in some respect to its life history. Observations of the copepod
aggregated along a shadow interface suggest that this possibly occurs (R. Burnett,
pers. comm.).
Summary
Tigriopus californicus, a high tide pool copepod, shows several separate
responses to light.
Dark-adapted T. californicus demonstrate a marked decrease in activity
immediately following the onset of illumination, reaching a minimum after 1-2
minutes.
Quantitative analysis of the light response indicates: (1) T. californicus
exhibits a heightened sensitivity to light at an intensity of 0.35 watts/m'. (2)
dark-adapted T. californicus more readily adaptsto dim light than strong light,
(3) the swimming velocity and activity of T. californicus increases with the
intensity of light
exposed to.
I. californicus exhibits a specific "dart-and-freeze" response to shadow
which may involve independentkinetic and tactic reactions, and which may be an
