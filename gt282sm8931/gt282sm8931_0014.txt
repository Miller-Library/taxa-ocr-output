both positive and negative phototaxis, and that each may be important to its
behavior in the field.
The increase in swimming speed and activity associated with increases in
light intensity, and the apparent dependence of activity on light in general
suggest that orthokinesis may be involved in the light response. The increase
in turning upon increasing illumination indicates that klinokinesis may be
involved as well. At least, there is the suggestion of a kinetic component to
the light response.
If the light response was exclusively kinetic, then the evidence collected
would predict Tigriopus to show negative phototaxis up to at least 2.0 watts/mâ€™,
The copepods would cluster in dimly illuminated areas where they were least active
and where an approach of the margins stimulated turning. In the trough, however,
Tigriopus is attracted to the brightest end, making the inclusion of a directed
taxis in the mechanism of the light response unavoidable. The frequent observation
of Tigriopus in aquaria congregating away from bright sunlight in the aks ence
of an intensity gradient further establishes the necessity for a directed taxis
in the light response mechanism. In fact, light-directed swimming can clearly
be observed in the phototactic response of Tigriopus to high salinities (positive
phototaxis), turbulence (negative phototaxis), and environmental anoxia (positive
phototaxis).
It is quite possible that both kinetic and tactic mechanisms are
involved in Tigriopus. A kinetic component to a phototactic response has been
studied before in the mussel crab Pinnotheres maculatus say (Welsh 1932).
While the kinetic and tactic components of a locomotory response are
ordinarily inseparable, there is some indication that they act independently to
some extent in Tigriopus. The "dart-and-freeze" response to shadow in Tigriopus
