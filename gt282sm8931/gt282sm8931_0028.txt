Figure 5: a. Histogram showing the distribution of the
swimming velocities of Tigriopus fifteen minutes after
the onset of illumination. The percent of all copepods swimming
within 6 mm/sec class intervals is shown for the four intensities
studied.
b. Activity given as a function of light intensity
in terms of percent of population moving () and mean swimming
velocity of moving Tigriopus (0).
