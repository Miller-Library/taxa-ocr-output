The mean values for all observations are shown in figure 12.
It is evident from these experiments that (1) Tigriopus is positively
phototactic at these intensities over a broad range of dissolved oxygen concentra-
tions, and (2) the degree of positive phototaxis is greatest at low oxygen conÂ¬
centrations, where the population distribution is more visibly skewed toward
the light. A measure of the phototactic tendend, is given by the slope of the
regression line for relative copepod density as a function of light intensity
because
(fig. 12). For this measure, two cm at each end of the trough were excluded copepods
were found to accumulate at both ends simply because of the associated decrease
in the number of available swimming vectors. While the data gives a reasonable
fit to a straight line, it is possible that a nonlinear function more nearly
describes the actual behavior. The slopes of the regression lines are compared with
dissolved oxygen concentrations in figure 13,
General Discussion
From the studies on Tigriopus californicus, it is clear that experimental
light conditions are highly artificial. However, laboratory experiments have
revealed aspects of the phototactic response that cannot be studied separately
in the field.
In the laboratory, attempts were made to simulate natural lighting as
nearly as possible; however, conditions differed from those in the field in three
major respects: (1) the intensity range, (2) the degree of directionality, and
(3) the degree to which the light intensity attenuates with distance.
Intensities in most experiments ranged from less than 0.04 watts/m? to
2.3 watts/m', as compared with light of 100 times greater magnitude striking the
