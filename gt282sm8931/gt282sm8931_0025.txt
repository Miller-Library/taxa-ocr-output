Figure 4: a. Response of Tigriopus to four sequential light
stimuli of decreasing intensity, preceded each time with
fifteen minutes of darkness: A--1.95 watts/m, B--1.05
watts/m, C—-0.58 watts/m, and D—0.05 watts/m. An illustra¬
tion of response magnitude is shown by the double-headed arrow
in response A. The percent population moving is given by My at
at maximum re-
the onset of illumination (time zero), and by M
sponse.
b. The same experiment as in Figure 4a, but with
results given as mean swimming velocity for moving Tigriopus
(O) and mean swimming velocity for all Tigriopus observed (0).
The response magnitude and recovery magnitude are illustrated
by double-headed arrows in response B. The mean swimming velocity
of the population is given at time zero by V, at maximum
and at maimum recovery within fifteen minutes
response by V
by V, as shown in A.
