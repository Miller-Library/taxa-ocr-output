environmental stimuli, yet to date no study on the phototactic response in
Tigriopus or of the effect of light intensity on the distribution of Tigriopus
within high tide pools exists.
Early observations also revealed that Tigriopus exhibits a specific
"dart-and-freeze" response (a sudden increase in forward speed, followed immediately
by immobility) when exposed to a sudden decrease in illumination. This behavior
has not been reported in other copepods or high tide pool invertebrates, though many
animals show a "shadow reflex" of some sort. Early observations also indicated
clearly that Tigriopus behaves differently upon first exposure to a given light
intensity than it does after a period of adjustment. The aim of the present
research was to answer two separate questions: (1) How does Tigriopus californicus
respond to sudden changes in light intensity?, and (2) How does a population of
Tigriopus californicus distribute itself in a light intensity gradient?
Response to Sudden Changes in Intensity of Light
General Materials and Methods
The response to changes in light intensity was assessed in terms of
activity, as measured by (1) the percent of animals moving, and (2) the swimming
velocity of moving animals. For the purpose of this research, animals swimming at
speeds less than 2 mm/sec were considered stationary,
To determine activity, experimental copepods were collected from a single
moderate-sized tide pool at a tidal height of about eight feet above mean lower
low water near the Hopkins Marine Station on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California,
from April to June, 1977. During the course of the experiments, the salinity in
this pool was observed to vary between 35 and 60 parts per thousand, and the
concentration of dissolved oxygen between 7 and 11 ml 09/1.
