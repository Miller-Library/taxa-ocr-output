Introduction
The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus is a major inhabitant
of pools in the highest intertidal zone on the rocky coast of western North
America. These tide pools experience water exchange with the sea during
only the very highest tides or in rough weather, and are otherwise wetted
by splash and spray alone.
Prelimminary observations showed Tigriopus to exhibit two general types
of reactions to light: (1) the tendency to aggregate either toward or away from
an illuminating source of relatively stable intensity, and (2) dramatic changes
in the activity, swimming speed, and rate of turning in response to sudden
changes in light intensity.
Early field observations suggested that the distribution of Tigriopus
within high tide pools is influenced by light intensity; the densest concentraÂ¬
tions of copepods were seen in the most dimly illuminated areas. Published
studies of the light responses in Tigriopus are lacking, but some other species
have been examined. The harpacticoid copepod, Harpacticus fulvus, tends to congre-
gate away from bright sunlight (Blum 1934). Several copepod species are known
to orient to polarized light, including the harpacticoid Tisbe furcata
(Umminger 1968). Finally, it is well-established that the vertical distribution
of pelagic oceanic copepods fluctuates diurnally, and the animals respond to
light intensity cues (Enright 1967, Backus 1965).
The environment of Tigriopus californicus is quite different from the
open ocean; it is extremely variable with respect to salinity, temperature, pH,
dissolved oxygen concentration, and turbulence, and affords little capacity to
buffer environmental changes (fgloff 1964). It is consequently easy to envisior
adaptive advantages for particular responses to light under particular
