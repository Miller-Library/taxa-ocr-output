Distribution in a Light Intensity Gradient
Materials and Methods
In order to determine the distribution of Tigriopus in
a constant
light gradient, the density of copepods was assessed at various points along a
plexiglas trough exposed to horizontally increasing light intensity. A horizontal
gradient was chosen in order to clearly discriminate between phototactic and
geotactic responses. The illumination was provided by a standard 43cm 15 watt
flourescent bulb above and parallel to the trough as shown in figure 10a One end
of the light source was covered by several layers of neutral density screen and
cardboard tubing; the resultant gradient is shown in figure lOb, as measured with
a Lambda Instrument Corporation Model LI-185 photometer held as near to one cm
below the surface as possible.
For each set of experiments, about 200 randomly sexed Tigriopus were
collected as described in earlier experiments. The copepods were placed in the
trough, distributed evenly, and left in darkness for fifteen minutes, at which
time the light gradient was presented. The distribution of animals was not
observed to change appreciably after fifteen minutes exposure to the gradient.
Consequently, the distribution recorded between 15 and 45 minutes were taken to
be indicative of phototactic behavior.
Tigriopus density was determined by looking through the unpapered side of
the trough and counting the number of copepods visible in Â½x  cm quadrats at
various positions along the length of the gradient, one cm below the surface. This
depth represented the population distribution within the entire trough, since the
relative densities of Tigriopus did not appear to vary with depth. Animal density
