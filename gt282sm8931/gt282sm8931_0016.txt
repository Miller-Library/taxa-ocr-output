escape mechanism.
T. californicus responds to an increase in illumination from below by a
marked increase in the rate of turning which attenuates with time.
T. californicus exposed to a horizontal gradient of overhead lighting
extending from 0.008 to 2.3 watts/m exhibit positive phototaxis in still water
over a broad range of oxygen concentrations. The magnitude of this taxis increases
as the level of dissolve oxygen decreases.
Comparison of the intensity-dependent activity of T. californicus and its
distribution within a horizontal light gradient indicates that the mechanism of
the light response involves both perception of light intensity and direction.
T. californicus demonstrate both positive phototaxis at low light intensities
and negative phototaxis at high intensities.
