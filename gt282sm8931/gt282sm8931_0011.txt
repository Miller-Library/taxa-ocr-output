was determined by correcting for the volume counted. For each set of replicate
experiments, the same animals were used, collected in a fine screen, and reintroÂ¬
duced to the trough prior to the experiment. In order to correct for variations in
the total number of animals used in comparable experiments, the distribution was
expressed in some cases as the percent of total animals counted occuring in each
of nineteen 2 cm segments along the trough (figure 10a).
In order to study the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on
phototaxis, three preparations of filtered sea water were used in the trough:
water water
water
N2-bubbled, aerated, and 0,-bubbled, with respective dissolved oxygen concentra-
tions of 0.7, 6.6, and 14+ ml 0,/1 before the experiment, and 4.0, 6.5, and 14+
ml 0,/1 afterwards, as measured with a Yellow Springs Model 54 oxygen electrode. All
experiments were performed at 2111 C and in a salinity of 35 ppt.
Experiments
How do Tigriopus distribute in the trough in the Abs ence of a Light Gradient?
When placed in the trough in aerated sea water under even illumination,
ed
copepods demonstrat no preference for one end of the trough or the other after
fifteen minutes (fig 10c).
How do Tigriopus distribute in the trough in the Pres ence of a Light Gradient?
How does Dissolved oxygen concentration affect this Distribution?
In order to answer these questions, the distribution of Tigrionusin the
gradient was measures at three different concentrations of dissolved oxygen. For
each concentration, several replicate experiments were performed. The results of
each experiment are shown in figure 11. A number of observations were made in
each case, and the results in figure 11 represent the means for observations
recorded between 15 and 45 minutes.
