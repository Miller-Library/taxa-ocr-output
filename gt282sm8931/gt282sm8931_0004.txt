For each experiment, 25 to 40 copepods collected from the tide pool about
twenty minutes beforehand were placed in a pyrex petri dish 14 cm in diameter
filled with freshly filtered sea water at a depth of 3 mm. The petri dish was
evenly illuminated from above at intensities of up to 2.0 watts/m2, as measured
by a Lambda Instrument Corporation Model LI-185 photometer held just below the
petri dish. The light originated from four 12 volt tungsten filament bulbs at a
distance of 15 cm above the dish, and was passed through one sheet of ordinary
white paper before entering the petri dish so as to simulate the diffuse overhead
lighting of a tidepool on an overcast day (fig. 1). The copepods were left in
darkness in this set-up for fifteen minutes before any experimental light
stimulus was presented.
The movement of the copepods was followed by high speed photographs
made at 0.5 second intervals with a Nikon F-2S camera and a MD-2 motor drive
attachment mounted 40 cm below the petri dish, and using available light. All
copepod velocities were calculated by projecting the sequence of negatives
through a photographic enlarger and tracing on paper the image of the copepods
shown in each negative. A grid above the petri dish permitted tracing successive
images in exact register, thereby indicating the position of each individual
copepod at 0.5 second intervals.
Prelimminary observations indicated no significant difference in the
swimming behavior of males and females. Consequently, the more clearly visible
ovigerous females were used in all experiments unless otherwise indicated.
Since the entire petri dish was not visible in the photographs, the swimming
speeds of copepods very near the edges or otherwise out of the field of view
were not measured. Swimming velocity, in each case, was calculated from measureÂ¬
ments made directly from tracings of the successive images of the same animal;
