Figure 7: Tendency to adapt to light at various intensities as
measured by the ratio of the response upon illumination
to the recovery. Absolute tendency to adapt, A, is given
by:

The line where Recovery equals Response is shown with a dashed
line (A=100). Relative tendency to adapt is given by (A-100)XI
where I is the intensity of light. This corrects for the fact
that low intensities represent a less radical shift from darkness
than higher ones and adaption occurs more readily.
