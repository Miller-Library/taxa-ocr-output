Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
namatocysts prepared with sucrose above may indicate a slight
difference in relative toxicity. The time to death of crabs
injected with the toxin in Crustacean Ringer's appears to be
somewhat shorter than for distilled water preparations. Dial-
ysis against Crustacean Ringer's did not result in a loss of
toxicity indicating that the molecular size of the toxin is
greater than 3500. Heat treatment destroyed toxicity.
The LD of the toxin from citrate prepared nematocysts
and dialyzed against Crustacean Ringer's was estimated by tes-
ting groups of three crabs at the following dilutions: full
strength, 32/100, 1/10, 32/1000, and 1/100. The LD appears
to be close to an amount of toxin present in 2'3 X 10° nemato¬
cysts or 3-68mg of protein per kg of crab.
Gel filtration resulted in the separation of the protein
into two fractions, one with a molecular size excluded and,
therefore, larger than 100,000, the other, a smaller sized
molecular component greater than the marker, cytochrome C, of
molecular weight 12,270, utilized in the fractionation. Neither
of these preparations could be shown to possess the toxicity
alone, although the high molecular weight component seemed to
produce an anesthetic effect on all injected crabs. As is shown
in Figure 2, the high molecular weight fraction appears to block
axonal conductance when tested on the circumesophageal connective
nerve of the lobster.
