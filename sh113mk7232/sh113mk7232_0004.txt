Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
parations by evaporation under vacuum at 30°0.
Toxin preparations were freed of isolation medium contam-
inants by dialysis using Spectrapor Membrane Tubing (Spectrum
Medical Industries, Inc.) against Crustacean Ringer's at 400.
Thermolability of the toxin was determined by heating at
100°0 for 30 minutes in a boiling water bath.
Molecular size of the toxin was estimated using gel fil-
tration on BioGel P-100 (Bio Rad Laboratories) at 50-150 mesh.
The effect of the toxin on the circumesophageal connective
nerve of the lobster, Homarus americanus, was tested. The nerve
was placed over a series of chloride coated silver wires with a
plastic container in the middle for the Crustacean Ringer's.
Stimulation was given upstream and propagated action potentials
recorded downstream from the Crustacean Ringer's. The Crustacean
Ringer's was then replaced by the toxin and action potentials a-
gain recorded. The recordings themselves were made with P8A.C.
pre-amplifiers (Grass Instrument). The outputs were viewed on a
Tektronix 502 oscilliscope and permanent recordings before and
after the change to toxic extract were made on photographic film.
(Kao and Fuhrman, 1967). The stimulus was set at 8volts, duration
0•82msecs., frequency 8°6pulses per sec., and 20volts per om sen¬
sitivity.
