Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
RESULTS
Nematocyst Isolation
Using the sodium citrate as an isolation medium, 7•5 X io
nematocysts were isolated from 500ml. of anemone. Of the total
number, 36% were dischargeable upon treatment with distilled
water; in the sodium citrate with final washing in sucrose,
1•94 X 10' nematocysts were isolated, 32% were dischargeable;
and with the use of sucrose throughout isolation, 7°8 X 10°ne-
matocysts were obtained with 40% dischargeable.
Toxic Extract from Purified Nematocysts
The toxic preparation obtained from nematocysts isolated
using sodium citrate alone contained 1e5mg of protein per ml re¬
leased from 9.0 X 102 nematocysts per ml. or 1-67 X 10-2Ug of
protein per nematocyst. Toxin prepared from nematocysts iso-
lated using sucrose in the final washing contained 2•8mg of pro-
tein per ml. released from 2•0 X 10° nematocysts per ml. or
1•4 X 10 JUg of protein per nematocyst. The amount of protein
released per nematocyst for preparations obtained using sucrose
alone was not determined. These preparations were assayed for
toxicity at one or two dose levels. The results are presented
in Table 1. All toxin preparations caused death of the assay
animal. The lack of such response at the lower dose level of
