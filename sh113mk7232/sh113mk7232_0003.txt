Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
the primary isolation was with citrate and the final purifica-
tion with sucrose. Figure 1 presents a flow chart describing
the isolation and purification procedures.
Not all nematocysts were discharged upon addition of dis-
tilled water and a hemocytometer was used to estimate the num-
ber of nematocysts, both discharged and undischarged, in the
extract prior to final centrifugation.
A protein determination (Lowry, 1951) was performed before
and following final centrifugation using a Bovine Serum Albumin
Standard. The amount of protein released per nematocyst was
estimated.
Toxin assays were performed on the crab, P. crassipes,
which is abundant in the rocky intertidal of the Hopkins Marine
Station. Crabs ranging in size from 11•0 - 47-3grams were in-
jected and maintained in separate containers at 16-18°0 and
fresh water was supplied 3-4 times daily. The injection was
into the venous sinus accessible in the upper joint of the left
leg of the crab. The volume injected ranged from O-055 - 1-5ml.
No effect other than death was noted. Toxin in distilled water
and toxin in Crustacean Ringer's solution (Pantin, 1934) were
compared. Control injections of distilled water and Crustacean
Ringer's were included in the toxin assays.
Toxin in Crustacean Ringer's was obtained by dissolving the
toxin in this solution after concentrating distilled water pre-
