Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
DISCUSSION
Nematocysts from the sea anemone T. crassicornis have
been isolated, their discharge collected and tested for tox-
icity. An injection of 1°25 X 10' nematocysts per kg of crab,
P. crassipes, or about 20mg. of protein per kg crab generally
produced death. The approximate LDgo of 2:3 X 10° nematocysts
per kg P. crassipes, or 3°68mg protein per crab, was about
1/3000 as toxic as that observed by Shapiro (1967) for Condyl-
actis gigantea using the crayfish as an assay animal. Due to
the pore size used in dialysis, the molecular weight must be
greater than 3500 because upon injection after dialysis, death
was still evident. That the toxin is proteinaceous seems likely
when molecular size is considered along with thermolability. Fur-
ther investigation is required to elucidate the effect of the tox-
in on axonal conduction.
Acknowledgements—A thank-you is not enough for the untiring
patience, guidance, and advice shown to me by Dr. F.A. Fuhrman and
Dr. J.H. Phillips, Jr. Not only did they make this investigation
possible, but they gave me something much more meaningful -- a
better understanding of the way in which all true "pursuers of
knowledge" must reason and act.
