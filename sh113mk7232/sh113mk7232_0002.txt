Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
extract caused rigid paralysis and death in crayfish, and af-
fected the firing of all classes of lobster and crayfish axons,
probably due to the toxin interacting with the nerve membrane
ionic conductance.
Tealia crassicornis (Muller, 1776), a brightly colored red
and green sea anemone of Central California was used in this
study. There have been no investigations of toxins from this
animal. The predominant nematocyst types of T. crassicornis
are basitrichs and microbasic p-mastigophores, along with spi-
rocysts. The toxic extract from isolated, discharged nemato-
cysts was characterized and assayed for toxicity in the crab,
Pachygrapsus crassipes (Randall, 1839) by injection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
T. crassicornis was collected subtidally from kelp beds
off Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. The
method reported by Phillips (1956) with several modifications
was employed inthe isolation of undischarged nematocysts from
the whole anemone. Three types of isolating media were used,
1MSodium Citrate in distilled water, 1MSucrose in O-45/Umilli-
pore filtered sea water, and a combination of the two where
