Tealia Nematocyst Toxin Purification
Abstract—A toxin from the nematocysts of the anemone
Tealia crassicornis has been partially purified. The
toxin is nondialyzable, of molecular weight greater
than 3500, and is heat labile, i.e. inactivated after
heating for 30 minutes at 100°0. The LD is estima-
ted to be the toxin from 2:3 X 10° nematocysts per kg
of the crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes. This correspon-
ded to 3-68mg of protein per kg of crab.
INTRODUCTION
Nematocyst toxin studies were revolutionized when Phillips and
Abbott (1957) developed "a method of obtaining purified suspen-
sions of nematocysts from sea anemones (Actiniaria) in order
to obtain a toxic preparation which could be considered nema-
tocyst in origin..." Blanquet (1968) isolated mainly acontial
microbasic mastigophore nematocysts from the sea anemone Aip-
tasia pallida and found that the toxin caused leg autonomy and
death in fiddler crabs; Hessinger and Lenhoff (1973a,b 1974a,b)
found that it also affected ionic conductance in crayfish giant
nerve fibers. Shapiro (1968a,b) used whole tentacle extracts
from the sea anemone Condylactis gigantea and found that the
