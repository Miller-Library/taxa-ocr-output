Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
The first site, the southwest portion of a rocky island
(Seal Island) about 40 meters east of shore, is the haul-out
site of ten to fifty seals every low tide (see Fig. 1).
This part of the island is the most sheltered from wave action,
and the most heavily used by the seals.
The second site was located on the southwest of Bird Island.
It differed from Seal Island in having higher resident gull and
cormorant populations, slightly greater wave exposure, and less
easily accessible deep water suitable for escape (Loughlin,
1974) at low tide. The third study site chosen, a piece of
the main land facing Seal Island, was comparable to Seal Island
in all but its proximity to human activity and its absence of
bird inhabitation.
Finally, two auxiliary study sites were used, both on the
north side of Bird Island. Wave exposure was high here. One
site was accessible from the bay by deep nearby channels at
all tides; this area was used for haul-out by from zero to
eight seals (mean of three) at low tides. The other site,
located adjacently, was only reachable by shallow channels at
low tide. It was closer to the main land shore and no seals
hauled out at this location.
Behavioral observations were done primarily from the roof
of three-story building A (see Fig. 1), and also from points
B and C. In-water observations came from the coves off beaches
M and N. Forty hours of observations over forty-five days were
made.
