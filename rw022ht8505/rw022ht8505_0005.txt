and R. affine cover on Seal Island was found to be significantly
higher on Seal Island (see Fig. 4).
In order to determine whether the observed differences were
due to general location differences, rock side algae composition
was studied. Four points on the north, the south, the east,
and the west sides of five rocks in each major area were counted
for algal species with use of a 20 x 20 quadrate. Quadrate locaÂ¬
tion and point determination were done as on the algae rock top
study. No significant differences were found between Seal Island
and Bird Island or the Main Land (see Fig. 3).
Comparisons by height of the four principle alga, Endocladia
muricata, G. canaliculata, Gigartina papillata, and R. affine
showed range variations only in R. affine, which was found from
50-155 cm. above MLL on Seal Island, and from 45-130 and 80-130
cm. above MLL on the Main Land and Bird Island, respectively.
More study is required to determine if the difference is actually
attributable to the seals.
Preliminary viewing had suggested possible morphological
changes in Seal Island G. canaliculata. Five rock tops in each
area were sampled for frond height and branching studies. Five
fronds from dispersed holdfasts on the rock tops were chosen.
Holdfasts were chosen to be representative of G. canaliculata
on that rock, but frond selection was blind. In addition, one
holdfast determined by coin toss location was picked and brought
into the laboratory. Holdfast fronds were spread out and random
counts determined two additional fronds which were measured for
