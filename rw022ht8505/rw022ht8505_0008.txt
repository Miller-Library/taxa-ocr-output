Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
ubiquitous "white blobs" are excluded, the remaining bacterial
counts are quite different. Bacteria distribution is likely too
highly variable for this small sampling to be conclusive.
Discussion
That the algal and snail differences of Seal Island were
only found on rock tops, and that the differences were also found
in the auxiliary sites, clearly indicates that harbor seals have
a definate impact on the midtidal biota where they haul out. This
impact can be expected to fall into three categories: mechanical,
chemical, and the resultant environmental. The action of crawling
out and sliding in may cause structural stress to algae, includ¬
ing the tearing noted in Phyllospadix root counts. Less tightly
attached animals are probably getting knocked off, as the low
L. scutulata and T. funebralis numbers suggest. In addition,
200 - 100 lbs. of seal resting, on average, 10 hours a day
(Loughlin, 1974) on the rocks may be related to the smaller G. can¬
aliculata plants, and may be squashing animal life such as amphi¬
pods.
Chemically, on two instances feces were found on the rocks,
and on one, some liquid discharge was found pooled in a rock
crevice. This must also be affecting the plant and smaller
animal life, even though the rocks are washed off by each high
tide.
Less quantifiable stress factors include decreased sunlight
