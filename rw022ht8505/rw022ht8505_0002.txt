Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
Introduction
The common harbor seal Phoca vitulina has been studied
both physiologically, and behaviorally in reference particu-
larly to fishing impact and mother-pup relations (Anderson,
1969: Ridgway, 1972: Wilson, 1974). However, little work
has been done on individual seal behavior with reference to
haul-out site, and on the impact of seal haul-out on the
intertidal forest community. This study on Phoca vitulina
richardi, the subspecies found on western North American coasts,
documents compositional and morphological changes in algae as
well as the differential animal populations found on haul-
out sites. A description of observed seal behaviors, par¬
ticularly as they relate to hauling out, is includéd.
Seals first began hauling out here at Hopkins Marine
Station Biological Preserve, Pacific Grove, California, only
about five to ten years ago (Abbott, 1979: Baldridge, 1979).
The local population appears to be stable (Harrold, 1977).
The area surrounding the point is urban; however, due to the
Preserve, island disturbance has been low.
Study Sites
Three principle and two auxiliary sites were used, all
within the Biological Preserve. All sites were chosen for
comparability of wave action, tidal height, and suitable rock
availability.
