More B. haliotiphila, L. cistula, T. pulloides and
fewer amphipods found on Seal Island rock tops.

Table 1
Bacteria from G. canaliculata fronds from the three
principle study locations show significant differences,
Seal Island from Bird Island, and Seal Island from Main
Land, excluding "white blobs"wwhich are ubiquitous.
Table 2 Numbers of seals counted under various conditions.
No differences significant due to high variability and
few observations. Possible trends for future study
are suggested, however.
