Fig. 1
Map of Hopkins Marine Station Biological Preserve
(Cooper, 1977). Principle study sites on Seal Island
(SI), Bird Island (BI), and the Main Land (ML), with
auxiliary stidy sites on Bird Island - North (BI-N).
Seal in-water behavior observed between points (B)
and (D). Observations from (A), (B), and (C).

Plant composition counts for 180 random sites at Bird
Island, Main Land, and Seal Island study areas.
A - G. canaliculata and R. affine counts from Fig. 2.
Fig. 3
B - Haul-out and non-haul-out algal counts.
C - Algal counts for rock sides. Studentst test done
with data transformed to the.2 power. Significance
not found.

Per cent cover of heavily used haul-out rocks (SI) and
rocks similar in tidal height and morphology (BI and ML)
show significant differences.

A - Fewer snails are found on Seal Island when rock tops

are studied, but no differences found on rock sides.
B - Tegula recounts on rock tops confirm absence seen in
(A).
