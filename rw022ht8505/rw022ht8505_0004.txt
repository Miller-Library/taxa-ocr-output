Boal
Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
Effects on Algae
In order to demonstrate possible differences in algal
species distribution, quadrates were placed in the study sites,
and the species under individual points were determined. Quad-
rate locations were randomly determined within axes parallel and
perpendicular to the coast. Individual points within the
quadrate were determined by random coordinates within a grid
system. Tidal heights from 15 to 190 cm. above MLL were inÂ¬
cluded. A total of 180 points on 18 different rocks were deter-
mined for each of the three principle study sites, as well as
50 points on five rocks in each of the two auxiliary sites.
Although no significant differences were found in the three
areas due to the wide height range included, possible trends
in both Gigarina canaliculata and Rhodoglossum affine were
suggested (see Fig. 2).
Algal counts from the two auxiliary areas for these two species
were compared (see Fig. 3). G. canaliculata was found more
frequently on the haul-out sites as expected; however, R. affine
was found significantly less frequently. This suggests that
R. affine differences may not, in fact, be due to the hauling
out.
Per cent composition was then determined by ten 20 x 20
quadrates in each principle study area. Rocks heavily used by
seals were sampled on Seal Island, and rocks as similar as
possible in morphology and tidal height were chosen from Bird
Island and the Main Land. In this comparison, G. canaliculata
