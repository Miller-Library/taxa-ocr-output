Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
Summary and Conclusions
Seal impact on haul-out sites was evidenced by;
1. Greater G. canaliculata and R. affine cover.
2. Shorter and darker G. canaliculata plants.
3. Plant tearing shown by Phyllospadix root visibility.
4. Increased B. haliotiphila, L. cistula, and T. pulloides
populations.
5. Decreased amphipod populations.
6. Fewer L. scutulata and T. funebralis.
7. Possible alteration of bacterial composition.
Seal haul-out behavior noted include:
1. Low tide population of 7 to 52 with a mean of 31.
2. Possible preference to haul out under conditions of sun
and negative tides.
3. Preferred rocks low, sheltered, near deep water, inacces¬
sible to land animals, and with as little nearby human
activity as possible.
4. Particular rock preferences shown by individuals.
5. Rock conflicts characterized by snorting, snarling, head¬
thrusts, flipper tapping, and pushing, with larger
seals' success.
6. Sustained pair bonding outside of mating season.
