Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
bralis were found on the rock tops, but not on the rock sides
(see Fig. 6).
Animals too small to be counted with the unaided eye were
counted by bringing 18 random 2 x 2 cm. algae samples from each
major site into the laboratory. Sample locations were determined
by random coordinates beneath the 40 x 40 cm. quadrates used in
algal studies. Barleeia haliotiphila, Lasea cistula, and Tri-
colia pulloides were all found in far greater numbers on haul¬
out sites, and amphipods were found significantly less frequently
(see Figs. 9 and8). (Amphipods were not counted on the auxil¬
iary sites).
Bacterial Differences
Bacteria on G. canaliculata was cultured on standard nutrient
agar medium (Difco) to determine if different bacterial composi¬
tion might be a factor in the greater small animal populations of
Seal Island. A total of fifteen 1.5 cm. high, comparable fronds
from five different rocks were taken from each principle study
area. One side of each frond was placed in contact with the agar
surfact, and then removed. The reverse side of the frond was
then touched to the agar surface of a second plate. The plates
were left under continuous florescent light for three days,
after which bacteria colonies were counted and described (see
Table 1). Total bacterial counts were not significantly differ¬
ent between Seal Island and the Main Land. However, if the
