Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
and warm, humid conditions maintained on the rocks during the
time the rocks are normally the most exposed. Qualitative
(tactile comparison) observations of rocks just vacated support
this stress hypothesis. Possibly, the higher range of R. affine
may be due to this seal-incubation phenomenon.
The possibility that seals may occationally feed in the mid-
tidal area places them in the position of top carnivore of the mid¬
tidal community. A comparison of fish found in seal stomachs
(Bigg, 1969 and Newby, 1969-71) and those found in the Preserve
intertidal (Nichols, 1979) suggest cabezon and sculpins as pos¬
sible prey. But, although as many as 32 seals have been sighted
in the area at high tide, a more usual number would be two to
four, and only upon disturbance were more than ten seals seen in
the water at a time. If the seals are feeding at this time, this
surely would affect the fishes and hence the community as a whole.
Thus, it is clear that at and near the harbor seals' hauling
out site, the seals have a definite and important impact on
the midtidal forest community. This should not be overlooked
in future studies of the midtidal region.
Seal Behavior
The harbor seal population at Seal Island ranged form seven
to fifty, with a mean of 31, at low tide during full daylight.
Observations were made for a total of about 40 hours in 45 days,
