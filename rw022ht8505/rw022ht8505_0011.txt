Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
(Bishop, 1968, as cited in Loughlin, 1974) were all observed.
In addition, the seals displayed a tapping of the front flippers
on the other seal. Both seals might continue this tapping at
eachother for 5-10 minutes or more. Finally, if one seal did not
move over sufficiently, the larger seal would push the smaller
seal off the rock. This pushing was observed on at least eight
separate occasions, the small seal losing in every case. Con¬
flicts were observed greater than thirty times, and snarling and
flipper-taps included in approximately 90% of the displays.
Smaller seals were noted for choosing rocks for consistant
hauling out that were not preferred sites. These were largely
high rocks (bare or partly bare of algae), and in some cases were
pointed or steeply sloped. This choice is understandable in
light of the observed large seals' dominence of preferred rock¬
types.
Using size as an indication of age, the population of Seal
Island is young. Large seals accountfor from O to 7 of the
hauled out seals sighted, 7 to 20 were quite small relative to
these, and remaining 20-, medium sized. Behavior differences were
noted between large seals and others. In case of disturbance, the
smaller were quicker to look around. The larger seals never tol-
erated a close human approach and were never observed to swim up
and watch people on the shore or follow the small boats departing
from the beaches, as were smaller seals. It is possible that
smaller seals are more accustomed to people and avoid them less,
which would help account for why this island population, so close
to Marine Station activity, is predominantly made up of small
