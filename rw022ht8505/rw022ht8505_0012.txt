Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
seals.
Play in the water off the beaches was observed about 60% of
observation days by at least one and up to nine seals at a time.
Water slapping was definately not correlated with warning, but was
displayed frequently by single seals. From observation to obser¬
vation time, consistent in-water individual seal identification
was not generally possible. However, in any given observation
period, seals were observed to slap the water with only the right
or the left flipper. This preliminary observation indicates
handedness, which although not mentioned in previous harbor seal
studies, has been a noted characteristic of other marine mammals.
Only one mother and pup were observed in the Preserve this
spring. The pup was the first ever sighted here. It may not have
been born here as it was only sighted beginning the last week of
May, and in the second week of observations, was not observed to
be permitted to nurse (although it was still quite small). This
lack of pupping here is probably due to the amount of human activ¬
ity nearby.
Two seals were recognizable in the water. A medium sized seal
and a small seal, they were sighted swimming together on more than
twenty different occasions throughout the study. This suggests
some lasting pair-bonding may occur, even at non-mating times of
the year.
