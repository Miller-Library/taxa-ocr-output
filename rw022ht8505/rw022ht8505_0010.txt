Seal Haul-Out Impact and Behavior
over a period of six weeks (April to June). Although too few
counts were made to show significance, trends show a possibility
of more seals hauling out in sun than in rain, and more at nega¬
tive tides than positive low tides (see Table 2). In general, at
high tide from one up to six seals cound be seen in the water
around and between points A and D (see Fig. 1). These most often
were smaller seals.
Because the haul-out site was so close to and in full view of
the shore, and because of the smallness of the population, indi¬
viduals were able to be distinguished. Eleven different indivi-
duals, relatively easy to site, were observed for rock preference
and individual behavior. (For aide in future studies a sample
score sheet for seal identification has been included. See Table
3). Rock preference was definately shown by the individuals
followed. At least five different individuals were found to be
returning consistantly to one to six particular rocks (some, more
than 95% of observation sightings). With only one exception
every identifiable seal seemed to have a preferred social set¬
ting: either in the thick of the crowd (there was generally a
crowd of 10 + seals in the most sheltered part of the island for
that tide), on the fringes of the crowd, or off by itself.
Certain types of rocks appeared to be preferred. They were
low, had flat top surfaces, were well sheltered from waves, and
were near escape channels. In times of crowding, conflicts
errupted over choice sites. Snorting, snarling, and head-thrusts
