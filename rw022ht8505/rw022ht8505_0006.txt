height (see Fig. 5). In the 25 sample study, significantly
smaller plants were found on Seal Island. In the 10 frond sample,
differences were not significant.
The twenty-five fronds per area collected above were measÂ¬
ured for branching. A frond was considered to start from the
holdfast itself and branches over 2 mm. in length were counted.
The Seal Island fronds were not significantly less branched,
but a trend for furthur study is suggested.
Six holdfasts from three rocks in each major area were coded
and three people not knowing the coding ranked the samples by
color. All Seal Island samples were universally ranked as
darker in color than all other samples.
Finally, observations had indicated Phyllospadix was torn
on Seal Island, so ten 20 x 20 cm. quadrates were placed on rocks
predominantly covered by Phyllospadix, and visible roots counted
(see Fig. 3). Clearly more were found on the Seal Island rocks
than in the other two study areas.
Effects on Animals
For determination of faunal differences, 20 x 20 quadrates
were randomly placed in the study sites and all animals easily
visible to the unaided eye were counted. For rock top versus
side comparisons, 50 cm. transects lines were run down the north,
south, east, and west sides of the rock from the quadrate, and
animals within 5 cm. of the lines also counted. Significant
