B. Discussion
The interaction between hermit crabs and sea anemones may
provide several benefits to both parties. By nestling, crabs may
be protected against dessication and predators. Anemones may also
receive some protection from dessication by having shells against
their columns. Crabs are probably obtaining nutrition from anemones
in the form of detritus from the column and tentacles, other animal
tissue from the gastric cavity and either anemone mucus or tissue.
It is still not clear whether hermit crabs remove tissue from whole
anemones. Besides the other observations already presented, crabs
move among tentacles such that their mouth parts would be in a position
to bite off tips of tentacles, but it is very difficult to see just
what the mouth parts are doing. The anemone may benefit from the
crab's behavior by having excess mucus and detritus removed, but,
of course, the removal of tissue and/or food would be deleterious.
When the removed crabs ran to their anemones after being replaced in
their tanks, they could have been seeking protection or going to the
anemone after being "reminded" of its presence by contact with anemones
in the test for protection.
With large anemones the crab engages in sweeping behavior
when encountering tentacles while walking along the column of the
anemone. The tentacles move so that the crab is able to walk freely
along the column area formerly under the drooped tentacles. By
sweeping the tentacles of small anemones the whole anemone closes
