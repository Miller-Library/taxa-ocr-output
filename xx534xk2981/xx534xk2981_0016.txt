species differences in protection against different species could
be explained by species-specific mucus: A. elegantissima is still
stimulated despite the presence of A. xanthogrammica mucus but
A. xanthogrammica is stimulated less in the presence of A. elegan-
tissima mucus.
The initiation of hermit crabs to anemones is similar to the
initiation of anemone-fish to anemones as described by Mariscal
(1966): the fish is stung upon contact with the anemone but continues
to touch tentacles and eventually is not stung. Schlichter (1972)
has shown that the anemone-fish becomes protected from nematocyst
discharge by acquiring anemone mucus. He proposes that this mucus
contains substances which de-sensitize the anemone's sensory inputs
so that the anemone does not sting itself or nearby objects with which
the tentacles have continuous contact. The acquisition of mucus may
also play a significant role in the acclimation of Pagurus samuelis to
Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica. Since an inanimate
object is able to become acclimated to an anemone, it is clear that a
theory explaining the crab's protection need not include a "crab
factor": we need not further examine the hypothesis that the crab
raises the threshold for nematocyst discharge by anesthetic or
recognition by the anemone. The development of immunity to nematocysts
after ingestion of anemone tissue would require a longer acclimation
period than has been observed; also, three crabs fed anemone tissue
for one week were still stung by tentacles,
