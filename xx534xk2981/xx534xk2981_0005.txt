crab would then walk onto the anemone and turn all the way around
the anemone, removing detritus from the column, or would shove its
cheliped into the gastric cavity as will be described later.
5. Stroking tentacles.
Crabs were observed using their chelipeds to stroke tentacles
from the base to the tip. The crab would move rapidly from one
tentacle to a neighboring tentacle. In response, the tentacle would
not contract but would move to where the crab pushed it and then spring
back to its original position.
6. Shoving cheliped into gastric cavity.
Crabs were observed walking onto the column and tentacles of
an anemone less than 5 cm. in diameter, sweeping their appendages
across the tentacles until the anemone was closed and then shoving
their chelipeds into the gastric cavity of the anemone. The crab
would usually bring its cheliped to its mouth upon withdrawing it
from the gastric cavity. Upon withdrawal of the cheliped the anemone
would begin to open up but would again close if the crab re-inserted
its cheliped. This activity was observed to continue for periods of
between  and 10 minutes. Crabs were observed climbing into the
opening of the anemone, almost disappearing from sight, only to climb
out within several seconds. Crabs were seen climbing into the mouth
opening of already-closed large anemones in only five cases of the
over 100 crab-anemone interactions observed in the field. In the
twelve lab set-ups with crabs and large anemones this behavior was
