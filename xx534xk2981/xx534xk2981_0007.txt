of the pedal disc from the substrate. The crab would then shove its
cheliped under the pedal disc and bring the cheliped to its mouth,
It was difficult to observe what the crab was holding in its chelipeds,
however.
The stomach, intestine and feces of a P. samuelis were examined
one and one-half hours after it was found stroking the tentacles and
climbing into the mouth area of a 5 cm. A. elegantissima. Zooxanthellae,
undischarged nematocysts and undischarged spirocysts were found in the
crab's intestine. Up to ten nematocysts/spirocysts and 50 zooxanthellae
were found in one 450x power microscopic field of the intestinal
material. It should be noted here that nematocysts and zooxanthellae
are found in both anemone tissue and mucus.
8. Protection from threat.
Threatened crabs on anemones remained on their anemone, backing
up around the anemone in the lab and wedging themselves between the
anemone and a rock in the field. In ten lab tanks with an anemone
and crab in each tank, the crab was removed from the tank to test for
protection against nematocysts and then replaced in the tank after a
few minutes. In six of the ten tanks the crab immediately ran to sit
beside the anemone or on the base of the anemone's column. In five of
these six tanks the crab had not been observed near the anemone for
several days previous to this encounter.
