on A, xanthogrammica, two crabs found on clonal A. elegantissima and a
crab which was climbing on the column and sweeping the tentacles of a
solitary A. elegantissima several days previous to the experiment.
An isolated crab was in the gastric cavity of an A. elegantissima for
20 minutes then escaped or was released, covered with mucus and missing
one antenna. The solitary A. elegantissima did not eat two crabs
found on clonal A. elegantissima, three crabs found near solitary
A, elegantissima and three crabs found on the tentacles of solitary
A, elegantissima. Seven A. xanthogrammica were tested for their
response to hermit crabs as food. One crab found on the column of
A. xanthogrammica but isolated 45 minutes was not dropped on the tentacles
but was captured as it began to interact with a lab A. xanthogrammica,
and was eaten. A crab from the isolated tidepool was taken into the
gastric cavity of an A. xanthogrammica 15 minutes then released. A
crab found on the tentacles of a solitary A. elegantissima and a crab
from clonal A. elegantissima were both eaten by A. xanthogrammica. Two
crabs found on the column and one crab from the oral disc of A. xanthoÂ¬
grammica were not eaten. The remains of a Pagurus granosimanus were
found in the gastric cavity of a Tealia lofotensis in the lab. The
crab and anemone had been in the same tank for a week prior to the
crab being eaten.
B. Discussion
Generally, solitary A. elegantissima will eat isolated crabs and
crabs associated with A, xanthogrammica but not crabs associated with
