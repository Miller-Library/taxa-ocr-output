V. DEGREES OF PROTECTION
A. Observations
A crab found on the column of an anemone may or may not be
protected against nematocyst discharge by the same individual
anemone; of 15 Pagurus samuelis found on A. xanthogrammica columns,
8 were protected against nematocyst discharge. Of 14 isolated crabs
tested, none were found to be protected against the tentacles of
either A. xanthogrammica or A, elegantissima.
A crab found on the column of A. xanthogrammica was not
protected against the tentacles of solitary A. elegantissima in all
nine cases tested and was not protected against clonal A, elegantissima
in 8 out of 11 cases tested. However, all seven test crabs found on
the column or tentacles of solitary A. elegantissima were protected
against A, xanthogrammica. In seven cases tested, five crabs found
on the tentacles of clonal A. elegantissima were protected against
solitary A, elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica.
Hermit crabs have not been observed on anemones other than
A. elegantissima and A, xanthogrammica, but various anemone species
were tested in the lab for response to crabs. Tealia lofotensis and
Tealia crassicornis tentacles stuck very strongly to both isolated
crabs and crabs associated with A. xanthogrammica. Corynactis
californica tentacles stuck to the appendages of an isolated crab but
did not stick to crabs associated with A. xanthogrammica. Metridium
senile tentacles did not stick to either isolated crabs, associated
crabs or my finger.
