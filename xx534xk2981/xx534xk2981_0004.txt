observed interacting with an anemone above water in the quadrats,
Of the fourteen lab relationships, all crabs but two, one with an
A. xanthogrammica and one with an A. elegantissima, were observed
walking on the columns of their anemones. All hermit crabs, including
the 17 isolated crabs observed in initial interactions with anemones,
were able to walk on the columns without being stung, and the anemones
made no response to the presence of crabs on their columns,
3. Poking tentacles.
Crabs were observed poking at tentacles with the tips of their
chelipeds and walking legs for periods of between 5 and 30 seconds.
The tentacles made no response, just as they made no response to the
gentle pokes of a straight pin.
4. Sweeping across tentacles.
In encountering tentacles, the crab would first poke the
tentacles as previously described and secondly sweep its antennae
then several appendages, both chelipeds and walking legs, over the
tentacles. In 5 out of 23 observations made of this behavior, the
crab went directly to the sweeping behavior without first poking the
tentacles. In response to the sweeps, the tentacles would move in
towards the mouth slightly such that the tentacles were no longer
drooping onto the column or substrate. Within thirty seconds, however,
the tentacles would droop back into their original position unless the
crab again swept its appendages over the tentacles. With small anemones,
continued sweeping resulted in the anemone closing completely. The
