solitary A. elegantissima. Crabs found on clonal A. elegantissima
may or may not be eaten. A. xanthogrammica generally will not eat
crabs found associated with other A. xanthogrammica. This agrees
with the other observations of species-specific protection and
varying degrees of protection.
The one occasion in the lab in which a crab was captured when
the crab approached the anemone to interact with it indicates that
anemones are able to catch hermit crabs as food.
VIII. SUMMARY
The hermit crab Pagurus samuelis is able to develop a relation-
ship with the sea anemones Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica
such that the crab is able to interact with the column, tentacles and
oral disc of the anemone without being stung by the nematocysts. The
crab steals the anemone's food from its gastric cavity, picks up detritus
from the column and tentacles, and eats either anemone tissue or mucus,
The protection against nematocysts is probably due to the acquisition
of anemone mucus on the crab's appendages so that the anemone responds
to the crab as it would respond to its own tissue.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to Chuck Baxter,
D. P. Abbott, I. A. Abbott and F. A. Fuhrman for their aid and
encouragement in the pursuit of elucidation of the anemone-hermit
crab relationship.
