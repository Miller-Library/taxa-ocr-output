5. Sweeping across tentacles.
The crab with the clonal A. elegantissima immediately began
to sweep its antennae across tentacles after its antennae were
protected. Three other crabs, the one with the solitary A. elegan-
tissima and two with A, xanthogrammica, were observed sweeping tentacles
while walking on the columns of their anemones several days after their
initial encounter.
6. Nestling
Nestling was observed with clonal A. elegantissima, solitary
A, elegantissima and two A. xanthogrammica the day after the initial
encounters.
Three weeks after their initial encounters the crabs were held
against the tentacles of their own anemones to test for protection.
Of the five total crabs with A. xanthogrammica, the crab with the most
tentacle contact during the three weeks was protected against nematocysts,
the crab with less tentacle contact was protected after one encounter
with the tentacles, and the three crabs with one or no encounters
during the three weeks were not protected. The crab with the solitary
A. elegantissima was stung upon contact with the tentacles four weeks
after the initial encounter, but the crab had not been observed near
the anemone for the previous eight days. The crab with the clonal
A. elegantissima was protected.
