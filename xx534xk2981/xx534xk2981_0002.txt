has no anemones within 5 meters of it. Crabs described as "protected"
did not stick to anemone tentacles and did not jerk back upon contact
with tentacles. A crab was tested for protection by holding its shell
near anemone tentacles and observing the reaction when the crab came
out of its shell and encountered the tentacles. Crabs were always
handled with blunt forceps. Anemones and crabs were kept in the lab in
clear plastic tubs with running sea water. The animals were not fed but
remained active and responsive during the course of the study. All
night observations were conducted with red light.
III. BEHAVIORS OF HERMIT CRABS ASSOCIATED WITH ANEMONES
A. Observations
Each of the following types of behavior was observed both
in the field and in the lab and both during the day and at night.
The crab's interaction with the anemone was found to consist of distinct
behavioral units which are described below.
1. Nestling.
A study was made of the distribution of the crab-anemone
relationship during the day in thirteen one meter square quadrats
at the 0.5 to 1.5 foot tide level when covered by 1 to 2 feet of quiet
water. Of the 262 hermit crabs observed, 17% were sitting quiescently
nestled against anemones. Of the 58 solitary A. elegantissima and
A. xanthogrammica under water in the quadrats, nine anemones (15.5%)
