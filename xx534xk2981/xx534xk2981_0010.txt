2. Retreating.
During the exploring behavior the five crabs with A. xanthogrammica
each came within a few cms, of their anemone and then quickly walked
backwards away from the anemone. The crab which eventually had the
greatest number of interactions with its anemone did this three times,
The two crabs which had an intermediate number of interactions each
retreated from their anemone twice, and the two crabs which had the
fewest interactions did this once each.
3. Contacting the column.
With the four A. xanthogrammica the first encounter consisted
of touching the column with antennae and appendages. The crab was not
stung and the anemone did not react.
4. Contacting the tentacles.
Three of the four crabs associated with A, xanthogrammica were
seen to contact A, xanthogrammica tentacles with their appendages and
antennae. In this first contact with tentacles, the antenna or appen-
dage stuck to the tentacle, released and then was placed back on the
tentacle. This was repeated two to ten times. For crabs with A. ele-
gantissima, their first encounter with anemones was to touch their
antennae to the tentacles, which was repeated up to twenty times.
After this encounter the appendage or antenna stuck fewer times for
shorter, less severe contactsâ€”the crab did not jerk back as much as
in previous encounters.
