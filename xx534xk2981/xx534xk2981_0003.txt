had crabs nestled against their columns. Of these nine, six anemones
had one crab against them, and the three other anemones had 2, 11 and
12 crabs nestled against their columns. Of the 28 solitary anemones
observed out of water, none had crabs nestled against their columns.
Of approximately 430 clonal A. elegantissima individuals observed,
four hermit crabs were seen nestled against individuals. Fourteen
anemone-crab relationships were set up in the lab: five tanks with
clonal A. elegantissima, two with a solitary A, elegantissima and
seven each with an A. xanthogrammica. Crabs were observed during both
the day and night nestling against the clonal A. elegantissima and the
solitary A. elegantissima and three of the seven crabs with A. xantho-
grammica were observed nestling.
2. Walking on the column.
Crabs were observed walking onto the column of anemones and
exploring it with their antennae and appendages. Using its chelipeds.
a crab often picked up detritus from the column and brought the detritus
to its mouth. Crabs sat quiescently on columns only occasionally. In
the previously described distribution study, 14.4% of the 262 hermit
crabs observed were found walking on the columns of anemones. Of the
58 solitary anemones under water, 8 had at least one crab walking on
their column: two anemones had one crab, two had three crabs, and the
remaining four anemones had 2, 4, 7 and 8 crabs on their column. Of
the 28 anemones observed which were out of water, one anemone had a
hermit crab walking on its column; this was the only hermit crab
