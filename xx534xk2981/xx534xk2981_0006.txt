never observed. In the field Mytilus califorianus tissue was fed to
a 15 cm. diameter solitary A. elegantissima which was almost closed,
and within five seconds three Pagurus samuelis on the column of the
anemone ran to the edge of the mouth opening, shoved their chelipeds
into the mouth opening, and removed and ate the Mytilus tissue.
7. Eating anemone tissue.
In the lab, two hermit crabs from the isolated tidepool and
three crabs found in the field on the column of A. xanthogrammica ate
excised tentacle, column and pedal disc tissue of both A. xanthogrammica
and A, elegantissima. A lab P. samuelis ate a tentacle excised from the
lab A. xanthogrammica which it often nestled against and sometimes
stroked the tentacles of. The stomach, intestine and feces of isolated.
field associated and lab associated crabs were examined three and one-half
hours after the crabs were given anemone tissue. Zooxanthellae (algae
symbiotic in anemone tissue and mucus) and three to ten undischarged
nematocysts were found in each digestive system component,
In lab and field observations, chelipeds were never observed
to "snip off" tentacles and damaged tentacles were never seen.
However, in the lab crabs were observed using their chelipeds to pull
at damaged pedal disc tissue of clonal A. elegantissima and damaged
column tissue of an A. xanthogrammica. Large chunks of tissue were
never seen in the chelipeds but the crabs did bring their chelipeds
to their mouths. In the lab and in the field crabs sitting on small
closed anemones were observed placing their chelipeds against the base
of the anemone and rocking backwards, thereby releasing a small part
