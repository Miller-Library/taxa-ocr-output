I. INTRODUCTION
The hermit crab Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857) was observed
on the column, tentacles and oral disc of the sea anemones Anthopleura
elegantissima (Brandt, 1835) and Anthopleura xanthogrammica (Brandt,
1835). The crab was apparently not stung by the anemone's nematocysts.
Symbiotic relationships have been described between anemones
and fish (Mariscal, 1966), anemones and shrimp (Dales, 1966), and
anemones and crabs (Davenport, 1966; Dales, 1966) in which the fish
or crustacean is able to move among the anemone's tentacles without
being stung by nematocysts.
This investigation examines the behavior of Pagurus samuelis on
Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica, the crab's behavior in
becoming protected against nematocyst discharge, and possible mechanisms
of protection from nematocyst discharge.
II. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS
All field and lab observations were carried out at Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. A. elegantissima and
A. xanthogrammica were collected from the Marine Station reserve
and from Pescadero Point on the Monterey Peninsula. Pagurus samuelis,
which live between the 0.0 and 1.5 foot tide level in crevices and
pools, were collected from the Marine Station reserve. Crabs described
as "isolated" were collected from an isolated intertidal pool which
