Hermit crabs found associated with anemones were isolated
from their anemones for various lengths of time and then their
protection against nematocysts was tested. The protection was found to
last from 45 minutes to three days.
B. Discussion
Apparently there are different degrees of protection against
nematocyst discharge, as evidenced by the varied times which crabs
remain protected and the fact that not all crabs found associated
with anemones are protected. In addition, there are species differences
between the protection acquired from an A, elegantissima and an A.
xanthogrammica. Possible explanations for these phenomena will be
discussed in the next section.
VI. POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION AGAINST NEMATOCYST DISCHARGE
A. Observations
Two isolated crabs which were stung by A. xanthogrammica were
allowed to walk on the column for two minutes. The crabs were then
stung in only 4 and 6 out of 8 encounters with tentacles of the anemone
and the stings were apparently less severe since the crab was able to
touch the tentacle for a few seconds before jerking back and the crab
did not jerk back as far as before.
After rubbing my finger along the column of an anemone 15 to
20 times, the finger no longer stuck to the tentacles of the anemone
