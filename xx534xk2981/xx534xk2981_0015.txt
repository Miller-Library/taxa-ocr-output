but a control finger did stick. A finger protected against A. xantho-
grammica was also protected against other A. xanthogrammica, but not
against A. elegantissima. A finger protected against A. elegantissima
was also protected against other A. elegantissima and slightly protected
against A. xanthogrammica (the stings felt less severe than the stings
on the control finger).
Paint brush bristles stuck to the tentacles of a lab A. xantho-
grammica, and still stuck after being brushed in the detritus on the
floor of the tank around the anemone. However, after being brushed
along the column ten times the bristles stuck in only five out of ten
and then in one out of ten encounters with the tentacles.
B. Discussion
These observations and those of initial interactions indicate
that protection is acquired by contact with the anemone. There is
no direct evidence that anemone mucus is the factor which provides
protection to the crab, but mucus is a likely substance to be transÂ¬
ferred from the sea anemone to a crab, finger, or paint brush. Perhaps
these items are protected in only a fraction of the same group of
encounters because of incomplete coating with mucus. The idea of a
mucus protection also fits the observations of different degrees of
protection: crabs may have acquired different amounts of mucus and
therefore be protected to different degrees. Also, the protection
could be lost by a loss of mucus, and the more mucus a crab had and/or
the less active a crab was, the longer the protection would last. The
