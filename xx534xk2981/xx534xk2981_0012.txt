B. Discussion
The behavior of an isolated crab with clonal A. elegantissima
was similar to the behavior, previously described, of crabs on clonal
A. elegantissima in the field. The only difference in behavior was
the initial encounter with the anemone in which the antennae of the
isolated crab stuck to the tentacles. The fact that at the end of
one month the crab with the solitary A. elegantissima was not protected
even though it had been at one point indicates that the protection
against nematocysts can be lost. This will be discussed further in the
next two sections. From the initiation set-ups with A. xanthogrammica
the following pattern of sequential steps leading to full protection
against nematocyst discharge can be elucidated: the crab retreats
from the anemone, later pokes at the column, walks on the column.
touches the tentacles and sticks several times, touches the tentacles
and sticks fewer times, and finally is able to touch, sweep and stroke
the tentacles without being stung. The retreating behavior indicates
that perhaps in the initial stages the crab perceives the anemone as
something to be avoided, but then changes this perception. However,
the fact that one crab was never seen to interact with its anemone,
and another crab was seen interacting only three times in four weeks
suggests that perhaps not all crabs seek to or are able to initiate
relationships with anemones.
