If the protection is strictly a matter of anemone mucus we
may ask why more animals are not associated with anemones in order
to reap the benefits of protection from predators and a ready food
source. In order to obtain anemone mucus without being captured by
the anemone, an animal must be able to jerk itself quickly and force-
fully from the tentacles when it is initially stung. Hermit crabs
and fish are capable of this. Because hermit crabs are scavengers,
they are able to exploit detritus on the anemone and partially digested
food in the anemone as food sources. Pagurus samuelis lives in crevices
and pools of the 0.0 to 1.5 foot tide level, a habitat which the
habitats of Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica include.
P. samuelis is therefore more likely to encounter these anemones than
P. granosimanus and P. hirsutiusculus which occur lower in the intertidal,
or shore crabs which occur higher. Occasionally these two other pagurid
species were observed interacting with A, elegantissima and A. xantho-
grammica and appeared to behave like P. samuelis. The main factor
preventing them from more abundant occurrence with anemones is probably
habitat exclusion.
VII. CRABS AS AN ANEMONE FOOD SOURCE
A. Observations
P. samuelis were placed on the tentacles of sixteen solitary
A. elegantissima to test the response of the anemones to hermit crabs
as food. The A. elegantissima ate two isolated crabs, two crabs found
