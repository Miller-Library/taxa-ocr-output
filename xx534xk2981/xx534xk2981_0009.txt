so the crab is free to walk on the anemone, pick up detritus, shove
its cheliped into the gastric cavity and walk into the mouth opening
of the anemone.
It is not clear why the crab strokes tentacles; the chelipeds
were seldom brought to the mouth during this behavior so the crab is
probably not eating. This behavior would fit, however, as would the
other crab behaviors, into the theory which will be discussed later
of anemone mucus as the crab's protection.
IV. INITIATION OF CRABS TO ANEMONES
A. Observations
One isolated Pagurus samuelis was placed in each of seven tanks,
each of which had one or more already-settled anemones. Five tanks had
one A, xanthogrammica, one tank had one solitary A. elegantissima and
one tank had twelve clonal A. elegantissima 1 to 2 cm. in diameter.
One crab was never seen encountering its A. xanthogrammica even after
two and one-half weeks in the tank, and so will not be included in the
initiation behavior data. The initiation behavior leading to protection
was observed to consist of the following sequential steps:
1. Exploring.
The crabs spent between 17 seconds and 10 minutes exploring the
tank, eating detritus and trying to climb the walls, before encountering
an anemone.
