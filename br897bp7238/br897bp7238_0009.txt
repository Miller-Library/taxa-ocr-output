avoidance of sunlight has been previously noted (Ricketts
and Calvin, 1968). This species was rare intertidally,
being more common subtidally.
STENOPLAX HEATHIANA
Stenoplax heathiana generally was found on the sides of
large, rather bare rocks resting on a sandy bottom; this is
in accord with observatinns by Johnson and Snook (1935)
and Ricketts and Calvin (1968). There seemed to be no sizeÂ¬
habitat relationship. One reason these animals can occur
on a barren substrate is they eat large bits of drift algae
that lodge at the base of the rocks (MacGinitie and MacGinitie,
1968).
TONICELLA LINEATA
Barnes (1972) notes that the presence of encrusting
coralline algae is critical to the habitat of Tonicella lineata
in the area he studied. Our observations support thisd
T. lineata was rarely found without coralline algae and was
most abundant in coralline-dominated tidepools or subtidally
with corallines, both erecat forms and crustose about 2 mm
thick. It additionally was found next to Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus and among Anthopleura xanthogrammica. T. lineata
was rarely exposed to direct surf, occurring primarily below
the 0.0 ft tide level, though sometimes found at higher levels
in tidepools. Point Pinos was the only site where T. lineata
was found in crevices, in the open. Only one animal was
found at Stillwater Cove.
