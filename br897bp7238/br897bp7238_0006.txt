MOPALIA CILIATA
Mopalia ciliata was the chiton least encountered, perhaps
because it was inconspicuous. Tucked in crevices among
Mytilus californianus Conrad, 1837, Tetraclita squamosa
rubescens Darwin, 1854, crustose coralline algae, Pelvetia
fastigiata and Endocladia muricata (Postels and Ruprecht)
J. G. Agardh, members of this species often had its girdle
buried in sand. Found mainly below the +2.5 ft tidal level
and noted subtidally at Mussel Point, this animal was exposed
to little or no surf.
MOPALIA HINDSII
We found Mopalia hindsii to be more exposed to air during
low tides than the other Mopalia species. Individuals were
usually in crevices nestled among associated algae, and often
covered with a thick algal growth on the valves.
MOPALIA LIGNOSA
Mopalia lignosa has the most specific habitat of the
chitons in this study. Individuals inhabited the undersides
of movable rocks resting on rocky bottom. Some animals were
found on the sides of rocks or in deep, smooth crevices and
occasionally at the bottom of high tidepools.
MOPALIA MUSCOSA
Mopalia muscosa was found predominantly in two habitats:
