ft. tidal level, totally exposed to full sunlight. This
conflicts with reports that individulas are sensitive to light
and only remain out of water when it is foggy (Ricketts
and Calvin, 1968).
CYANOPLAX HARTWEGII
Cyanoplax hartwegii was found in two distinct habitats:
1) under Pelvetia fastigiata (J. G. Agardh) DeToni; and 2)
in small, wet crevices or depressions. Occasionally individuals
were found under Fucus distichus Linnaeus. Apparently,
constant moisture and protection from direct surf are major
characteristics of the C. hartwegii habitats. Less than 2%
of those studied were exposed to direct surf, perhaps becasue
they cannot maintain attachment when exposed to wave shock.
Macroalga cover was not always present, though crustose
coralline algae or Hildenbrandia occidentalis Setchell were
consistent companions at all locations except the wet shale
at Stillwater Cove. C. hartwegii's common occurance under
fronds of Pelvetia is described by Ricketts and Calvin (1968),
and we confirm this association. We found no avoidance of
direct sunlight, as long as sufficient moisture was present
(e.g., wet shale at Stillwater Cove), an observation in conflict
with one recorded by Ricketts and Calvin (1968).
ISCHNOCHITON REGULARIS
Ischnochiton regularis was found only on the bottom of
