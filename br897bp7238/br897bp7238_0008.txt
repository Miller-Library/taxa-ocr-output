palmaeformis Ruprecht. Surf strength at depression localities
varied widely from very strong at Yankee Point to moderately
weak at Stillwater Cove. Nuttallina californica was found
in areas both with and without macroalgae, though highest
densities were in the macroalgae-free depressions. Apparently.
a major habitat factor is the need for protection from the
direct shearing force of the surf. Only about 5% were not
firmly entrenched in a crevice, depression, or space where the
surf's force was depleted. MacGinitie and MacGinitie (1968)
say N. californica inherit and live in deep depressions in
rocks exposed at low tide, and feed on debris which collects
in these depressions. We found individuals on rocks exposed
to a wide range of surf strengths, but few such rocks were in
areas of weak surf. More than 98% of the animals were in
the presence of erect or crustoee coralline algae. None
were found on flat areas, unless sessile animals or highÂ¬
profile algae were present. The largest individuals were found
in the high, shallow tidepools, but here the density was very
low.
PLACIPHORELLA VELATA
Placiphorella velata were found on the flat sides of
movable rocks and on the walls of deep tidepools, always below
the -1.0 ft tidal level. The individuals were always found in
shade and always with red crustose coralline algae. Their
