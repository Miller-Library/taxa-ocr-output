Intertidal Chiton Habitats
page 2
INTRODUCTION
Chitons make up a conspicuous postion of the intertidal
fauna of the California coastline. Various species are
known to be characteristic of particular intertidal zones
(Ricketts and Calvin, etc.), yet little is known about their
specific habitats. Only two researchers have given this topic
more than cursory treatment in print; Barnawell, (1954)
for Mopalia spp. and Barnes (1972) for Tonicella lineata
(Wood, 1815).
We selected six areas of the Monterey Peninsula shoreÂ¬
line, differing in exposure and substrate, and examined the
speific habitats of the following chiton species: Cryptochiton
stelleri (Middendorff, 1846); Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter,
1855); Ischnochiton regularis (Carpenter, 1855); Katharine
tunicata (Wood, 1815); Mopalia ciliata (Sowerby, 1840);
Mopalia hindsii (Reeve, 1847); Mopalia lignosa (Gould, 1846);
Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846); Nuttallina californica (Reeve,
1847); Placiphorella velata Carpenter in Dall, 1878; Stenoplax
heathiana (Berry, 1946); and Tonicella lineata. These habitats
are herein described. Also included is a description of the
habitat where juvenile chitons were most commonly found.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From April 22 to May 9, 1974, each study site was surveyed
during the lower lowtides. Descriptions of plant and animal
