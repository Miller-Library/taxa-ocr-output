mainly of horizontal tables of shale exposed at low tide.
at the north edge of a sandy beach.
The Cypress Point site resembles the site at Yankee
Point, but the slope of the terrain is steeper and a large
algae are more abundant.
Point Pinos marks the south entrance to the Monterey
Bay. Granite promotories and large, isolated rocks are
exposed to strong surf. These formations partially protect
the study area which was an area along the shoreline and was
composed of boulders separated by channels and pools.
Mussel Point is exposed at the south side of Monterey
Bay. The granite substrate often forms vertical surfaces
with distingt algal zonation.
The data collected during our study are presented in
table and figure form. Table 1 lists algal and animal
associates, surf strength, vertical range, and additional
comments useful in finding each species.
DESCRIPTION OF HABITATS CHARACTERISTIC OE SPECIES STUDIED
CRYPTOCHITON STELLERI
Cryptochiton stelleri was found next to and in very deer
tidepools and channels. They were not predominantly on huge
rocks on sandy beaches, contrary to the findings of MacGinitie
and MacGinitie (1968). We encountered individuals at the t1.O
