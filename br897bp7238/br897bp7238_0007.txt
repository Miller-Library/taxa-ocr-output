1) in wet, protected, large crevices from the +1.5 ft to t3.0
ft. tidal levels; and 2) in high, protected tidepools up to
+5.0 ft tidal level. In addition, after individuals were found
under algae (Fucus distichus and Pelvetia fastigiata), and
under rocks. At Stillwater Cove, a high density also was
found on slight irregularities along flat, horizontal, very
wet shale. None were exposed to direct surf. More than 97%
of the individuals examined were in direct contact with moisture;
either touching a pool of water (in tidepools or crevices).
lying partially buried in moist sand, or sitting under wet
macroalgae. More than 90% of the individuals examined had
their anterior ends lower than their posterior ends and in
contact with moisture. Almost all individuals (with the
exception of those at Stillwater Cove) were found near either
Peyssonnelia meridionalis Hollenberg and Abbott or crustose
coralline algae.
NUTTALLINA CALIFORNIA
Nuttallina californica was found in three distinct
situations. Listed in order of highest to lowest density.
these were: 1) the bottom of bare rock depressions the size
of their bodies; 2) squeezed between the bases of Tetraclita
squamosa rubescens, Pollicipes polymerus, (Sowerby, 1833), and
Mytilus californianus; and 3) wedged in small crevices in high,
shallow tidepools. Rare individuals were found in large, shallow
depressions at the base of Pelvetia fastigiata and Postelsia
