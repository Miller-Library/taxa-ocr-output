Andrus and Legard Intertidal Chiton Habitats
associates of each species of chiton were recorded, along with
detailed chiton density maps (maps on file at Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California). Species were collected
and identified using Burghardt and Burghardt, 1969, the key
to chitons in Light, et.al., (1964); and a preliminary copy
of the chiton key appearing in Smith and Carlton (1975).
From May 10 to May 28, all six study sites were examined for
habitat parameters characteristic of the most abundant chiton
species. Relative surf and sun exposure, substrate conditions
and vertical distribution (as determined by algae distribution
- Doty, 1946) were noted. Sites were examined at high tide
as well as low water, to determine the surf strength.
STUDY SITES
Figure 1 shows the locations of the sites on the Monterey
Peninsula.
Yankee Point consists of large granite platforms split
by many deep channels. Isolated shallow tidepools and deep
pools, with sparse flora and abundant fauna, are exposed to
strong surf action.
Carmel Point consists of a broad belt of large granite
boulders bordered by a sandy beach, it experiences moderate
surf action. The boulders provide for few tidepools, and only
a few small, protected channels are present.
Stillwater Cove is protected by a natural off-shore
