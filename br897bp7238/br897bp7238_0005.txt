Intertidal Chiton Habitats
smooth rocks, 15 cm to 30 cm in diameter, resting on a rocky
bottom. The only other organisms found on these rocks were
unidentified microscopic green and blue-green algae. Individuals
were usually found in groups of two or three per rock. All
seemed to avoid direct sunlight. No mention of I. regularis
habitat was found in the literature.
KATHARINA TUNICATA
Katharina tunicata was abundant in two distinct habitats:
1) in low numbers at the Iridaea flaccida (Setchell and Gardner)
Hollenberg and Abbott level of almost vertical granite surfaces,
a habitat found at almost all the study sites; and 2) in higher
numbers in shallow, exposed tidepools with crustose coralline
algae covering the bottom; this habitat occurred only at
Yankee and Cypress Points. In addition, small individuals
(less than 6 cm long) were found in depressions inhabited by
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson, 1857) and
Anthopleura xanthogrammica (Brandt, 1835). At Yankee Point
we observed a size gradient with larger animals further from
the surf. The largest were found in the protected channels on
the leeward walls. Our results agree with previous work
(MacGinitie and MacGinitie, 1968) in that individuals were
found along open, rocky coasts, not necessarily in direct
surf, but not in a habitat as well protected as Stillwater
Cove.
