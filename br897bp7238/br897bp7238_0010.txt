Intertidal Chiton Habitats

JUVENILE CHITONS
The habitat of the majority of juvenile chitons was:
a) low in the intertidal ranging between the O and +3 foot
tidal levels; b) damp; c) shady or dark; d) protected from
wave shock by surrounding boulders, overhanging ledges, or
by being within crevices. This zone corresponded to that of
tunicates and sponges. Yet a young chiton was never found on
either, but rather on bare rock or rock encrusted with such
algae as Corallina gracilis forma densa Collins, and members
of the genera Lithothamnion, Lithophyllum, and Hildenbrandia.
SUMMARY
1. The habitats of 12 intertidal chitons from six sites on
the Monterey Peninsula in central California picked for
variability in surf exposure and substrate type, were
described in terms of physical factors and biological
associates. The chitons were Cryptochiton stelleri,
Cyanoplax hartwegii, Ischnochiton regularis, Katharina
tunicata, Mopalia ciliata, Mopalia hindsii, Mopalia lignosa
Mopalia muscosa, Nuttallina californica, Placiphorella velata,
Stenoplax heathiana, and Tonicella lineata.
2. The most important environmental parameters in determing
chiton habitats proved to be surf strength, light exposure,
substrate compositin, moisture and biological associates.
