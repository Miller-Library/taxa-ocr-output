Abstract:
Changes in the activity of glycolytic enzymes in response to hypoxic stress have been observed in
many different species. I examined the enzymatic response of Gillichthys mirabilis (common name;
longjawed mudsucker; family <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Gobiidae : Exact'>Gobiidae)</span> to hypoxia. The critical oxygen tension (P.) for G. mirabilis, the
tension below which the rate of oxygen consumption precipitously drops, was approximately 1.1 mg/L. I
subjected 26 fish to hypoxic stress by reducing the 1021 in their aquarium to 0.3 +0.1 mg/L below their P.,
0.8 mg/L. Fish were sacrificed at three time points after the onset of hypoxic stress: 0, 8, 24, and 72 hours.
Tassayed liver and white muscle tissue from each fish for activities of 5 enzymes involved in anaerobic
catabolism of glucose: phosphoglucoisomerase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and
hexokinase (liver only). No significant change in any of these glycolytic enzymes was observed,
indicating that the concentrations of these enzymes do not change during 72 hours of hypoxia. I also
assayed liver and white muscle for the concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), a potent
activator of phosphofructokinase, a rate-governing enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. Significant increases
in F-2,6-BP levels were observed between the 0 and 8 hour time points in the liver and between the O and
72 hour time points in white muscle. It is likely that the increase in F-2,6-BP levels promotes an increase
in glycolytic flux to compensate for decreased aerobic ATP production under hypoxic conditions. Thus,
modulation of pre-existing glycolytic enzymes, rather than increased concentration of the enzymes, seems
to be responsible for elevating glycolytic activity during hypoxia.
Introduction:
The longjawed mudsucker, Gillichthys mirabilis (family Bobiidae), is often found
in the mud flats of tidal estuarine environments. Although the natural history of the
mudsucker has not been fully elucidated, it has long been hypothesized that the
mudsucker may burrow into the mud as the tide goes out. Furthermore, G. mirabilis has
been found in the burrows of several different estuarine crustaceans (1). Oxygen levels
drop to zero at only a few inches depth of mud. Likewise, oxygen concentrations in the
small amount of water lest in crab burrows as the tide goes out may fall to very low
levels. Whether <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>G. mirablis burrows</span> itself or borrows the burrows of its prey, it seems
likely that this species of fish is regularly exposed to hypoxic or even anoxic conditions
on a tidal time course. Furthermore, G. mirabilis is tolerant to a wide range of
environmental fluctuations, including fluctuations in temperature and salinity. Recent
studies have found that the longjawed mudsucker also has a significant tolerance to low
oxygen conditions and can survive in hypoxic waters for up to 7 days time (unpublished).
The mudsucker's wide range of tolerances coupled with its tidal exposure to hypoxic
conditions make it a good model for studying hypoxia tolerance.
There are two general strategies for dealing with hypoxic stress: metabolic
suppresion and increased glycolytic flux (2). Many non-vital functions, on both the
cellular and behavioral levels, can be suppressed to reduce the ATP requirements of an
organism. For example, most protein synthesis in the liver is shut down and unnecessary
locomotion is avoided (3). Alternatively, glycolytic flux can be increased to compensate
for decreased aerobic ATP production. Many species in the genus <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Carassius : Exact'>Carassius,</span> e.g. the
goldfish and crucian carp, even utilize an alternative pathway, with ethanol as an end
product, to regenerate NAD (4). This allows them to maintain relatively high glycolytic
flux rates, without the potentially acidotic side effects of lactate as the glycolytic end
product. Most vertebrates, however, must suffer the acidotic side effects if forced into
prolonged anaerobic catabolism. In both strategies alterations in glycolytic enzyme
activities are observed.
Another possible mechanism for coping with regular hypoxic stress is the
maintainence of high glycolytic capacity in the tissues, thereby reducing the magnitude of
a given hypoxic insult. This strategy does not, however, preclude the changes in
glycolytic enzyme activity that are typically seen with the other strategies.
Oxygen has long been known to be a potent regulator of gene expression.
Cultured mammalian cells will coordinately up-regulate all II glycolytic enzymes when
exposed to hypoxia (5). In 1991, the hypoxia-inducible factor-I (HIF-1) was discovered
in studies on the human erythropoeitin gene (6). In response to hypoxic condtions, HIF-1
promotes the expression of genes with the HIF-I binding site in their 5' and 3' flanking
regions. Many genes have been shown to be HIF-I inducible including those encoding
erythropoietin and vascular-endothelial growth factor, both of which are involved in
increasing oxygen delivery via increased blood supply to tissues. Furthermore, the
glycolytic enzymes are inducible by HIF-I in mammalian systems, with the exception of
phosphoglucoisomerase and phosphoglucomutase (5). Increases in transcriptional
activity often lead to increased gene products in the cell, and thus the actions of HIF-I are
likely to increase cellular concentrations of glycolytic enzymes.
Enzymatic activity could also be affected by the actions of allosteric modifiers
The advantage of such a mechanism is the speed with which it could be implemented and
the lower energetic cost, since protein synthesis is expensive. One such modifier is
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP). F-2,6-BP is a potent activator of
phosphofructokinase, which is considered to be one of the rate governing glycolytic
enzymes. Thus, by increasing or decreasing the levels of F-2,6-BP, G. mirabilis could
rapidly regulate glycolytic flux to compensate for hypoxic stress.
In order to understand what type of strategies are employed by the longjawed
mudsucker in hypoxia tolerance, I assayed white muscle and liver from G. mirabilis for
glycolytic enzyme activity. Both tissues were also assayed for the concentration of F-
2,6-BP.
Materials and Methods:
Animals:
Gillichthys mirabilis were collected from University of California, Santa Barbara
lagoon in Santa Barbara, CA in early March, 1999. Fish were held in glass aquaria and
acclimated to Monterey Bay seawater (temperatures 13°-14° C) for at least four weeks.
The fish were fed every other day with a commercial diet (Bioproducts Inc., Warrenton,
Or.).
Critical oxygen tension:
To determine the critical oxygen tension (Pe) for G. mirabilis, a single fish was
placed in a sealed chamber and oxygen concentration in the water was monitored with the
OxyGuard probe (Point Four Systems Inc., Port Moody, B.C. Canada). We determined
the P. to be the concentration of O2 at which a sharp decrease in the rate of O2
consumption by the fish was observed.
Hypoxia Time Course:
I subjected G. mirabilis to hypoxic conditions by placing them in a custom
designed aquarium in which the O2 content can be controlled. Hypoxic conditions were
maintained through a simple feed-back mechanism: a rise in [O21 above a set point value
(as monitored by the OxyGuard probe) would cause a solenoid valve on a N2 tank to
open. The Nz gas was shunted through the aquarium in-flow, thereby stripping the O2
from the water. This system maintained O2 concentrations at a set point (+O.1 mg/L). I
defined 0.8 +0.1 mg/L to be hypoxic, because these O concentrations were
approximately O.3mg/L less the Pe. Experimental treatments included 0, 8, 24, and 72
hours of hypoxia. For each treatment 7 fish were placed in a Tupper-ware container
punctured multiple times to allow adequate water flow. Tupper ware containment
minimized the amount of flight response upon sacrificing the fish, thereby maintaining
glycogen stores in muscle tissues. At each of the later two time points, there was a single
mortality and thus only six fish were assayed from these treatments. At the designated
time points, fish were killed by freeze-clamping in liquid nitrogen. Frozen specimens
were weighed and then stored at -70°C until assays were performed.
Enzyme Assays:
l assayed white muscle and liver tissue from Gillichthys mirabilis for the activity
of 5 glycolytic enzymes: enolase (ENO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH
phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), hexokinase (HK; assayed in liver only), and pyruvate
kinase (PyK). All assays were run on the SpectraMax 340pc 96-well plate reader using
the Softmax Pro version 2.6.1 software (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Ca.), following
established protocols (7). Each sample was assayed in triplicate, for each enzyme. A
substrate-free assay was run for each triplicate set, to control for background pyridine
nucleotide oxidation/ reduction in the homogenate. All assays were performed at 25°C.
Reaction mixtures for each assay were as follows:
Enolase: 8 mM MgCl», 7.2 mM glucose, 0.72 mM ADP, 0.32 mM NADH, 1.75 U/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.5
U/ml LDH, 24.8 U/ml hexokinase, 5 mM 2-phosphoglycerate, 0.49 mM KCl, 48.8 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Lactate Dehydrogenase: 0.64 mM NADH, 1.31mM pyruvate, 0.6 mM KCl, 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Phosphofructokinase: 8 mM MgCl, 0.8 mM KCN, 2 mM ATP, 2.08 mM AMP, 0.32 mM NADH,
3.7U/ml aldolase, 66 U/ml triose phophate isomerase, 10.4 U/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, 8 mM fructose-6-phosphate, 0.43 mM KCl, 42.6 mM Hepes, pH 8.4.
Phosphoglucoisomerase: 0.8 mM NADP, 14 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 4 mM fructose-6-
phosphate, 83 mM KCl, 82.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Pyruvate Kinase: 8 mM MgCl, 2 mM ADP, 0.32 mM NADH, 11 U/mI LDH, 1.5 mM
phosphoenolpyruvate, 7.2 mM KCl, 71.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Each enzyme assay was linked to the oxidation or reduction of a pyridine
nucleotide cofactor, either NADH or NADP+ Enzymatic rates were determined based
on change in absorbance of the pyridine nucleotide molecule at 340 nm. Net initial
reaction rates are reported (averaged triplicates - control). Any linking enzymes
necessary for cofactor coupling were added in excess to ensure that the rate determining
step of the reaction was the enzyme in question.
Since path lengths are unknown for kinetic assays in the 96-well plate reader,
conventional International units (micromoles of substrate converted per unit time) cannot
be determined. Instead, initial reaction rates are reported as time averaged milli¬
Aborbance (in Opitical Density Units) /min. All rates are normalized to protein
concentration in homogenates, as determined by Coomassie Protein Assay (Pierce,
Rockford, II.) using BSA as a standard.
Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate:
Tassayed white muscle, liver, brain, and heart, for concentrations of fructose-2,6,-
bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP). The standard protocol for the F-2,6-BP assay, which measures
the stimulatory effect of tissue extract on potato tuber pyrophosphate-dependent
phosphofructokinase (Bergmeyer, 1984), was modified for the microplate reader by
reducing all volumes by a factor of 10 to the final volume of 100 ul. The final reaction
mixture was:
Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate: 2 mMMg, 1 mM fructose-6-phosphate, 0.15 mM NADH, 0.01U/ml potato
tuber pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase, 3.7 U/ml aldolase, 66 U/ml triose phosphate
isomerase, 10.4 U/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mM pyrophosphate, 50 mM Tris, pH
8.0. Samples or standards were all diluted such that the concentration was 510° MF-2,6-BP.
Raw data were analyzed and graphed on SigmaPlot for Windows version 5.0,
except for the P. data which were graphed on Microsoft Excel 97. Students t-test was
used to determine statistical significance in pair-wise comparisons between hypoxia
stressed fish and the control group.
Results:
The rate of oxygen consumption from aquarium water in three different fish
precipitously drops around 1.1 mg/L (Fig. 1). I have designated this value as the Pe. I
also observed that gill ventilation increased from zero visible ventilations to between 80-
120 ventilations per minute (data not shown) when the concentration of oxygen fell
below the P. value of 1.1 mg/L. Each of the three fish tested were of different weight,
indicating that the critical oxygen tension is not a function of size. The rate of oxygen
consumption does seem to vary with size class, although the statistical significance of
these variations was not tested in this study.
After 8 hours of hypoxia, ENO, PGI, PyK, and LDH from white muscle (Fig. 2
and 3) showed no statistically significant change (p» 0.05). Enzyme activities in liver
also did not vary: HK, ENO, PGI, PyK, and LDH showed no statistically significant
trends in 72 hours of hyoxia (Fig. 4 and 5). The lack of change in enzymatic activity
indicates a stable concentration of enzymes assayed.
Figure 6 shows the concentration of F-2,6-BP in liver and white muscle over the
hypoxia time course. There was a significant increase in liver F-2,6-BP levels by 8 hours
of hypoxic stress (p = 0.018, 0 hours: mean = 0.2336, S.D.= 0.621; 8 hours: mean -
0.7333, S.D. =0.2491). After 8 hours of hypoxia, the [F-2,6-BP in the liver did not
change statistically. In white muscle, neither the 8 nor the 24 hour time point showed a
statistically significant change, although there is a general upward trend. There was,
however, a significant increase by 72 hours of exposure (p = 0.017, 0 hours: mean -
0.3913, S.D.=0.4445; 72 hours: mean = 1.1094, S.D. = 0.4106).
Discussion:
The critical oxygen tension of a species can be a good indicator of the type of
oxygen environment in which that organism evolved. The P. value of 1.1 mg/L is in
agreement with previously measured P. values in G. mirabilis (1). Furthermore, the Pe
of G. mirabilis is comparable to the P. of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Sebastolobus alascanus : Exact'>Sebastolobus alascanus</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Scorpaenidae : Exact'>(Scorpaenidae,</span>
Teleosti), a benthic species that resides at depths within the oxygen minimum zone
where O2 can be less than 0.3ml/L (8). Thus, it seems likely that G. mirabilis has
developed physiological traits specific for tolerance of low oxygen conditions.
One such hypoxia tolerance trait in G. mirabilis may be a constitutively high
anaerboic capacity via the glycolytic pathway. Support for this hypothesis can be found
in the lack of change in glycolytic enzyme activities in white muscle or liver of G.
mirabilis when it is exposed to hypoxia. Since all the enzyme assays were run with
saturating substrate concentrations, it is likely that no change in reaction rates occurs
because there was no change in enzyme concentrations (for a brief discussion of the
Michaelis-Menten kinetics that allow this inference see Pierce and Crawford, 1994).
Furthermore, it has been found that the brains of G. mirabilis contain unusually high
concentrations of LDH (pers. comm. George Somero) and it may be that all of the
glycolytic enzymes have high standing stock concentrations like LDH. Thus, pre-
hypoxia enzyme concentrations appear to be sufficient to support vital energetic needs in
low oxygen stress.
My findings are also inconsistent with the hypothesis that glycolytic enzymes in
G. mirabilis are HIF-I inducible. This inconsistency would be a significant break from
the mammalian paradigm of hypoxic defense strategies. Because glycolytic enzymes are
highly conserved across evolutionary time, this apparent divergence in regulation patterns
poses many interesting questions. For example, how prevalent of a divergence is it?
That is, at what taxonomic level does the divergence occur? Do all species of fish lack
HIF-I inducibility of glycolytic enzymes or is the trait specific to the goby family or even
just to G. mirabilis?
It is possible that the severity and/or time course of hypoxia were not sufficient to
trigger HIF-1 mediated gene induction. This seems unlikely for two reasons. First, the
72 hour time course of hypoxic exposure is likely to be considerably longer than any
length of hypoxic exposure that G. mirabilis may experience in its natural setting due to
the tidal cycle. Second, it is obvious based on the results of the P. experiment, the severe
depletion of liver glycogen stores and systemic increase lactate levels (Stonington,
unpublished), and the observation of increased ventilation frequency, that the fish in my
experiment were experiencing considerable hypoxic stress. It would be valuable to
obtain the DNA sequence data for the genes encoding for the glycolytic enzymes assayed
in this study and look for HIF-I specific sequences in the 3' or 5' flanking regions.
The approximately three-fold increase in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
concentrations in both white muscle (7.8 ng/g at 0 hours and 22.2 ng/g at 72 hours) and
liver (11.7 ng/g at 0 hours and 36.7 ng/g at 8 hours) indicates an increased capacity for
glycolytic flux. This may increase the anaerobic catabolism of glucose and help
compensate for the decreased production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. If this is
the case, then it is clear that modulation of pre-existing enzyme stocks is an important
mechanism by which G. mirabilis is able to tolerate hypoxic stress. One advantage to
this strategy is the rapid time scale over which glycolytic flux can be regulated. This
point is illustrated well in the liver where within 8 hours of hypoxic stress there is a three
fold increase in the concentration of F-2,6-BP as well as a massive depletion of glycogen
stores.
Through allosteric activation of PFK by F-2,6-BP over a short time scale, G.
mirabilis can respond rapidly to decreased O2 availabilty without relying on expensive
protein synthetic machinery. This fits well with the environmental conditions that the
mudsucker may face: regular hypoxia on a tidal time scale. It is interesting, then, to
compare what is now known about the strategies employed by G. mirabilis, and those
employed by organsims that experience hypoxic stress under different time scales and
severities. Species of the genus Carassius, to which both the crucian carp and the
common goldfish belong, show a distinctly different strategy. Many of these species live
in fresh water ponds that may completely freeze over during the winter months. Like the
longjawed mudsucker, these fish will burrow into the mud. However, the ponds in which
they live rapidly become anoxic, and the carp or goldfish will face several months
without O2. When goldfish are exposed to anoxia there is a tissue-specific response: F-
2,6-BP levels dropped in liver, gill, and spleen, wheras F-2,6-BP levels increased in the
brain and heart (9). The use of ethanol by species in this genus also allows for a long
term reliance on glycolysis with out acidotic side effects. It appears that G. mirabilis and
goldfish employ opposite strategies in the liver. While goldfish must ensure that the
brain will have an adequate supply of glucose throughout the whole winter, G. mirabilis
will get a fresh supply of oxygen with the next incoming tide and thus need not conserve
glycogen stores as strongly.
It is also interesting to note the differences between G. mirabilis and mammalian
cells lines in their responses to hypoxic stress. Whereas mammalian cell lines
coordinately up-regulate the glycolytic pathway, there is no change in enzyme
concentrations in the mudsucker. Most mammalian systems do not face significant
hypoxia except under unusual crises (a notable exception is the diving mammals). Thus,
mammalian cells are not geared towards dealing with hypoxia whereas, it seems likely
that G. mirabilis has a high glycolytic capacity for dealing with regular hypoxic stress.
In conclusion, it seems that the strategies an organism uses to tolerate or defend
hypoxic insults are dependent on the severity and time scale that the organism
experiences during its natural life history. G. mirabilis may be particularly well suited
for short-term regularly occurring hypoxia, whereas Carassius species are suited for long
term anoxia. The findings on enzyme activities also provide a cautionary note to
researchers about making assumptions that mechansims of mediating environmental
stress may be conserved across taxonomic groups such as teleosts and mammals.
Further work that would help elucidate the mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in G.
mirabilis include assaying heart and brain tissues for enzyme activities and F-2,6-BP
concentrations.
also be interesting to assay for glyco
jould
gen phosphorylase activity
in each tissue, because glycogen phosphorylase is directly responsible for breakdown of
glycogen stores.
