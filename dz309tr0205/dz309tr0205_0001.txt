Diet of Cyanoplax
page 2
INTRODUCTION
Although chitons are abundant along California shores,
studies of their food and feeding have been limited largely
to species of Mopalia (e.g. Barnawell, 1960; Boolootian, 1964).
Placiphorella (see McLean, 1962), and Cryptochiton (Macginitie
and MacGinitie, 1968). The purpose of this study was to
examine the diet of the chiton Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter,
1855) in different habitats. I also include a few notes on
the slit formula of the plates of C. hartwegii.
Intertidal Habitats of Cyanoplax hartwegii.
Cyanoplax hartwegii on the Monterey Peninsula, California,
is found in the mid and upper intertidal zones. Three
general habitats where large numbers of C. hartwegii were
present were studied.
First, at approximately the +2.0 ft. tide level, C.
hartwegii was most common underneath the brown alga Pelvetia
fastigiata (J. G. Agardh) DeToni on otherwise nearly bare
rock in an area of low wave action. Here Pelvetia covered
approximately 70% of the rock area, providing a shady and
moist environment even during daylight hours and at low tide.
Because of shading by algae and by other rocks, only about 5%
of the rock was exposed to sunlight at low tide. Pelvetia
was by far the dominant alga; small amounts of Hildenbrandia
occidentalis Setchell, Petrocelis franciscana Setchell and
Gardner, Gigartina papillata (C.A. Agardh) J. G. Agardh,
Fucus distichus Linnaeus, and crustose corallines were also
