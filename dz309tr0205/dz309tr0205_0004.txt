of the material in each individual. Hildenbrandia occidentalis,
and Petrocelis franciscana were found in much smaller
quantities in many individuals.
In the crevice habitat where Pelvetia was absent,
Cyanoplax hartwegii ate moderate amounts of Hildenbrandia,
Petrocelis, Endocladia, and Cladophora spp. The relative
quantities of these algae in the digestive system varied in
the 17 individuals examined, but for the population as a whole
they occurred in roughly equal amounts in the total gut content.
In the tidepool habitat the 30 Cyanoplax hartwegii
examined displayed a more varied diet. Gigartina leptorhynchos
appeared in many Cyanoplax here, but many other algae were
present in small quantities, including crustose corallines.
Even when Gigartina and crustose corallines were present in
the Pelvetia habitat and crevice habitat, they were not eaten.
Thus, it would appear that there is a preference for Pelvetia,
Hildenbrandia, Petrocelis, Endocladia, and Cladophora spp.
when these are present.
In the gut of C. hartwegii, larger algal species (e.g.
Pelvetia) and encrusting algae (e.g..Hildenbrandia) appear
in very small pieces indicating feeding by rasping. However,
algae with slender branches or highly dissected blades (e.g.
Endocladia muricata, Gigartina leftorhynchos) appear in the
gut much larger pieces, reminiscent of algal fragments found
in the guts of Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847) by
