using Smith (1944) and were verified by Dr. I. A. Abbott.
The digestive diverticulum was not extensively examined since
several dissections yielded only blue green algae and yeast
cells.
Specimens of Cyanoplax hartwegii were identified as
such on the basis of size, color, shape, insertion plate
slit formula, and comparison with museum specimens of C.
hartwegii and Cyanoplax dentiens (Gould, 1846) identified by
Allyn G. Smith and kindly provided by the California Academy
of Sciences. Average insertion plate slit formulas (11-1-11
for C. hartwegii, 11-1-10 for C. dentiens) proved unreliable
for identification. In specimens conforming to C. hartwegii
in all other respects, numbers of slits ranged 9-12 in the
head valve and 8-11 in the tail valve (Fig. 1). The formula
11-1-10 occurred most often, which is the slit formula
given for C. dentiens.
SSULTS
The results of the gut content analyses of 65 Cyanoplax
hartwegii from the various habitats are shown in Figures 2
and 3.
Since Pelvetia made up 70% of the plant cover of the
Pelvetia habitat, it is not surprising that the 18 Cyanoplax
hartwegii taken here ate large amounts of this alga. Pelvetia
occurred in 89% of the digestive tracts and comprised the bulk
