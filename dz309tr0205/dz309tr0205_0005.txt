Diet of Cyanoplax

Nishi (1974), and suggestive of feeding by biting or tearing
algal branches.
SUMMARY
1. Stomach contents were examined in 65 specimens of Cyanoplax
hartwegii taken from three different intertidal microhabitats
near Monterey, California.
2. In the Pelvetia bed habitat, Pelvetia made up 80% of the
total diet, while in the higher crevice habitat, the algae
Hildenbrandia, Endocladia, Petrocelis, and Cladophora spp.
comprised 90% of the diet and were eaten in relatively
equal amounts.
3. In the high tidepool habitat, C. hartwegii ate a much
wider variety of algae.
Gigartina and Hildenbradia together
made up 40% of the diet. Crustose corallines and Gigartina
occurred in all habitats examined, but were eaten by Cyanoplax
only in the tidepools.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Isabella A.
Abbott for technical help in all aspects of the gut content
analysis and identification of algae. My appreciation cannot
be measured. Her guidance in all areas of the study, and her
insight and beauty as a sincere, warm human being made my time
at Hopkins Marine Station an experience I will never forget.
