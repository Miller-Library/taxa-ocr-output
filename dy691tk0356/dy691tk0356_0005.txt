Figure 7 depicts displacement studies during the night. In analyz¬
ing the first run, there was no significance evident between the light
and dark conditions. During the second run, however, highly significant
movement took place between the dark period of 1830-1000 and the following
lighted interval (p « .005), and motion significant to between .025 and
.Ol occurred during the dim period between 1700 and 1830.
DISCUSSION
As mentioned in the introduction, T. pulligo has been shown by field
observations to undergo a significant vertical migration up kelp plants
at night, with downward movement as daylight increases. Predation by
visually-cued animals known to prey on T. pulligo such as Enhydra lutris,
Hexagrammacus decagrammus, Damalychthys vacca and Octopus (Hunt, 1977)
could make such behavior selectively advantageous. During the day, though
some individuals may be found exposed on the blades and stipes, the bulk
of the population remains low on the plant, hidden from view, thereby
escaping detection by many predators. At night, a larger percentage of
the population moves up onto the stipes and blades feeding.
Such behavior, however, was not clearly and consistently seen in the
laboratory. With the notable exception of the population of animals used
for the Figure 5 experiment, those animals given one day or less to
acclimatize to the system showed no significant movement of mean height
with varying light intensities. Animals which had been in the system for
two days or more began to show movement bordering on significance (p «.05).
The animals allowed four days or more in the system before being observed
demonstrated a clear migration of population mean height as a function
of light intensities. Their peak height was attained during the dark
intervals, as was the peak of the field population. This would indicate
