FIGURE 7
Figure 7 presents the data from a simulated night
displacement experiment. The same animals as were
used for the Figure 6 experiment were removed and
returned to the cylinder in darkness. After six
hours of darkness, lights were turned on. The lower
light regime plot indicates the times when a light
burned out, dimming ambient levels until a replacement
bulb could be obtained. The solid line indicates the
mean heights during the first day; the dashed line
outlines the mean height curve for the second day.
As no distinction between above or below the box top
were made, mean heights are for the entire population.
