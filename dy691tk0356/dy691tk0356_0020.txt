FIGURE 6
Graphed is the data from a day displacement experiÂ¬
ment. Animals were given one day under artifical lights
to adjust. They were then removed from the cylinder,
and dropped back in along the walls, to simulate being
knocked from plants by surge during the day. A period
of six hours light was followed by nine hours of dark.
The solid line traces the mean heights for the first
day; the dashed line follows the mean heights for the
same group on the second day, after a simulated night
displacement experiment.
