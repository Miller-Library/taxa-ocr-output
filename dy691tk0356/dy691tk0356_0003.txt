to allow viewing inside the cylinder. Animals collected at random from
the field were dropped in the cylinder and given between one and three
days to adjust to their new environment before observational periods began.
During several studies, natural light passing through a skylight above
the apparatus was the sole light source. In those studies which used
artificial lights, 8 75 watt GE reflector bulbs and 1 650 watt Sylvania
DWV movie light were used. To allow additional flexibility in establishing
desired gradients, 4 of the 75W bulbs and the 650W bulb were controlled by
a Variac regulator, and varying thicknesses of window screening were
attached to the outside of the cylinder. All light intensities reported
were measured with a Weston Model 703-60 Type 3A photometer on the outside
of the cylinder. A red-cellophane-covered flashlight with a peak intensity
of 50 Foot-Candles was used to determine the position of the snails at
night. Fresh sea water (about 14°C) flowed continually throughout the
system. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analyses were done by
Student's T-test.
RESULT!
Figure 1 is a schematic presentation of the light intensities generally
encountered in the field. As the study progressed, the canopy thickened,
and ambient intensities decreased slightly.
Figure 2 presents the results from a study using natural daylight
and one day of acclimation. It shows a slight tendency for the animals
to move up in darkness, but statistical tests between the mean heights
during the dark interval and those of the lighted periods show no signifi¬
cance (p».9). Additional analysis between bright (200 ft.-candles) and
dimmer conditions heights did not show any significance to exist, either
(.5 «p «.9).
