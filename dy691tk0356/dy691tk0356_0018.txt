FIGURE 5
Animals were given one day to adjust under artifiÂ¬
cial light. Peak intensity during the study was 70
foot candles; the cross-hatched interval indicates a
slight light leak.
The lower figure follows the mean height of the
animals above the top of the plastic box supporting
the plant. The upper figure shows the distribution
of the animals as percentages within quarter cylinder
intervals. The numbers adjacent to the lowest interval
indicates the percentage of the total population
located below the top of the plastic box.
