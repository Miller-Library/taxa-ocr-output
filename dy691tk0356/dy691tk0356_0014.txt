FIGURE 3
The group used in this experiment were given one day
within the system prior to observations under artificial
light. The dashed line is the mean height plot for the
total population; the solid line is that of those animals
above the top of the supporting plastic box. The top
figure plots the distribution of animals as percentages
per quarter cylinder intervals. The numbers within the
bottom intervals refer to the percentage of the total
population found below the top of the supporting box.
