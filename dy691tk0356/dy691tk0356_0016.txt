FIGURE 4
Animals were run simultaneously with those of Figure 3,
but had different history. Given one day initially to
adjust, the animals were used in a two day displacement
study, which involved being displaced four times during
the study. Thereafter, the animals were left undisturbed
in the same conditions as Figure 3 group. However, at
1600 on the first day of this study, the animals were
displaced in a move necessary to standard lighting seen
by both groups.
Light intensities were measured between the two
systems, and are in foot-candles. The dashed line is
the mean height curve for the entire population; the
solid line is the plot of mean height for those animals
above the top of the plastic supporting box. The top
figure shows distribution of the total population as
percentages per quarter cylinder intervals. The numbers
within the lowest intervals are the percentages of
the total population found below the top of the box.
