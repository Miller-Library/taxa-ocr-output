that the animals required a longer period of adjustment to the experimental
conditions than had been anticipated.
The data presented on Figure 5 also calls to attention the importance
of accurately determining the light intensities actually seen by the
animals, both in the field and within the apparatus. As seen in Figure 1,
the light experienced by the animals on the kelp appears to be in the 0-125
ft.-candles range. Only during the study presented by Figure 5 was the
light that dim; in the other studies, the light shown on the animals
tended to be higher for at least a part of the study. The longer period
of adjustment could be in response to those higher levels of light.
Determining the actual levels seen by the animals within the cylinder was
also difficult, since intensity varied as readings were taken around the
circumference. In future work, it might prove informative if distinctions
were made as to the location of an individual, i.e., behind a blade, in
the center of the cylinder, on an extreme wall. The variability of
responses within the laboratory system could be a reflection of not having
taken such considerations fully into account.
Individual variability was touched upon only superficially by tagging
and monitoring individual's positions, and could use more work. Samples
of the field population were haphazardly taken, and their treatment was
not standardized. Perhaps by controlling for such specific factors as
sex, size, time since last feeding, or collection site variability of
response might be reduced.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSTONS
1) T. pulligo undergoes a nocturnal migration in the laboratory similar
to that seen in field studies.
