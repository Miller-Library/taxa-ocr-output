FIGURE 2
Animals were allowed one day to acclimatize under
natural light. Light intensities were measured at the
1.5 M and 0.5 M levels on the outside of the system. In
the lower figure, the dashed line indicates the mean
height of the entire population; the solid line depicts
the mean height of the animals found above the top of
the plastic box to which the plant was attached. The
top figure plots the distribution of snails as perÂ¬
centages per quarter cylinder interval. The numbers
within the bottom interval refer to the percentage
of the total population located below the top of the
supporting box.
