INTRODUCTION
Tegula pulligo is the commonest trochid gastropod found in the kelp
forests of Monterey County. Previous distributional studies on T. pulligo,
T. montereyi and T. brunnea by Lowry and Pearse (1974), Hunt (1977) and
Sellers (1977) indicated that the three populations stratified on
Macrocystis plants, with T. pulligo usually occupying the lower four meters
of the plant.
Preliminary subtidal observations in the kelp forest adjacent to the
Hopkins Marine Station at Mussel Point in mid-April yielded data suggesting
that T. pulligo underwent a diel vertical migration on the kelp, with up-
ward motion occurring at night. Subsequent field studies by Thornton
(reported in this volume) have shown there to be a statistically significant
migration of the population in our study area.
Laboratory studies were undertaken in attempt to 1) demonstrate the
observed field behavior in a laboratory environment and 2) to determine
what effect light, or its intensities, may have on any observed behavior.
If light was shown to be an important regulating factor, it was also hoped
to obtain a general light-preferred range and maximally tolerated intensity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All experiments were conducted using a clear acrylic cylinder measurÂ¬
ing 2 m high and having an internal diameter of 14 cm. A single kelp plant,
usually having between eight and twelve stipes, and its holdfast, was
attached to a weighted plastic box and sunk in the cylinder. The box was
perforated and prevented animals from blocking water flow, and decreased
the directional nature of the flow by allowing multiple outlets or inlets,
depending on flow direction. Blades on each plant were trimmed as necessary
