The animals represented by Figure 3 were allowed one day of acclima¬
tion and artificial light was used. There appears to be vertical movement
with peak height occurring in the brightest light interval. Testing be¬
tween the mean heights of the light versus dark periods showed a close to,
but not quite (p«.065) significant displacement of the animals with differ¬
ing light conditions. Further, no significance between dim and bright
conditions was demonstrated (.2 «p «.4).
In the experiment represented by Figure 4, the lighting was the same
same as Figure 3 but 4 days of acclimation was used. The population ex¬
hibited a clear migration upward corresponding with the dark interval.
The significance of the movement was dramatic (po.0001). Again, tests
were conducted between bright and dim mean heights, and they showed no
significant differences to exist (.2 «p«.4).
The data depicted on Figure 5 came from a study where dim artificial
light was used (a peak of 70 ft. candles) and one day was allowed for
acclimation. The mean height during the lighted intervals is rather
significantly lower (0.02 « p « 0.05) than the mean heights during the
dark condition.
Figure 6 presents the data from a displacement experiment. Animals
were removed, then dropped back into the cylinder in light. They were
given 6 hours of light followed by 9 hours of dark. One run showed a
highly significant (using 952 confidence intervals established by T-test)
increase in mean heights during the dark interval. The second run showed
a dramatic increase also, but it occurred during the lighted period. In
combining the two runs, however, no significant differences between dark
and light heights can be shown (.05 « p «.1).
