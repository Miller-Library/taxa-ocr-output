the Israeli Mediterranean coast, mixed mussel beds of invasive Brachydontes pharaonis and
Mytilaster minimus revealed a higher biomass of the invasive species in each clump (Riloy et al.
2004).
That study also exhibited a trend similar to that seen with the mussels of this study, where
the invasive species is usually larger than the native (Braby and Somero 2006). Mytilus
californianus is also a large, longer-lived, and thicker-shelled mussel with strong byssal thread
attachments, a potential obstacle for M. trossulus in any mixed-species beds (Hunt and
Schiebling 2001). For M. trossulus this could result in crowding out or smothering, limited
access to food, and difficulty in recruitment. As shown in a study done with M. edulis and M.
trossulus by Dolmer (1998), faster growing, larger mussels occupied the top of the three-
dimensional aggregations found in the rocky intertidal. An additional consideration is provided
by a study done in a hybrid zone in Southwester England, which showed that M. edulis sought
the edges of clumps and exhibited weaker byssal thread attachment than M. galloprovincialis,
(Schneider et al. 2005). This superficial positioning, combined with weaker attachment
facilitates dislodgement by waves and, therefore, higher mortality. Mytilus edulis also showed
higher mortality rate in the center of the bed than M. galloprovincialis and their hybrids. This
resonates with studies conducted in the hybrid zone of California and the intermediate characters
of the hybrid mussels (Braby and Somero 2006). Further studies should be carried out to look at
the within patch location of each mussel species.
4.2. Predator-Influenced Aggregation Experiment
Mussels under predator-influenced conditions demonstrated no preference for neighbors
(except in the M. californianus/M. galloprovincialis combination); however, there was a trend
towards larger clump sizes. Okamura (1986) noted that M. edulis in larger groups experienced
