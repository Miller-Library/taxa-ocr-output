Fig. 1. Predation aggregation experimental set-up. A two-compartment tank had water flowing
into and through the animal-holding area and out through a hole in the second compartment. The
predator-conditioned water then flowed into the container with the mussels.
Fig. 2. Predator-free aggregation. Data are the average difference between neighbors of the same
species and neighbors of a different species in each of the five replicate containers. Zero
indicates no preference between species and the difference has been taken to show divergence
from the null hypothesis. The three graphs represent the mean divergence from zero and *
denotes significant results of t-test, P+ 0.01.

Fig. 3. Predator-induced aggregation. Data are the average difference between neighbors of the
same species and neighbors of a different species in each of the five replicate containers. Zero
indicates no preference between species and the difference has been taken to show divergence
from the null hypothesis. * denotes significant results of t-test, P+ 0.05.
