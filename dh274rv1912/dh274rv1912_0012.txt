decreased growth and reproductive output. The mussels on the edges of the bed were also subject
to disproportionately higher predation rates by a predatory crab. Hunt and Schiebling (2001) also
recognized the negative correlation between shell length and clump size, so in areas with high
predation such as Cranberry Cove, Canada, there was a higher proportion of small mussels. So
patch size influenced by predation levels may have considerable impact on the fitness of the
mussels in the clumps. Mytilus trossulus appears to have a lower tolerance of harsh conditions in
general, reaching a smaller size (size and fecundity are linked), prospering more in protected
estuarine environments, and being driven northward in its distribution by the invasive M.
galloprovincialis (Braby and Somero 2006). Larger-sized and mixed species clumps could
negatively affect the survival of this native species.
4.3. Nucella Feeding Experiment
The observation that N. ostrina prefer M. trossulus over M. galloprovincialis has
potential implications for the structuring of native mussel communities on the California coast.
Navarrete and Menge (1996) demonstrated that Nucella species have a significant ecological role
in controlling mussel population size. In light of the data shown herein, Nucella predation could
be a factor contributing to the success of the invasive M. galloprovincialis over the native M.
trossulus. Since Nucella species seem to have genetically programmed prey preferences (Sanford
et al. 2003), it is important to note that N. emarginata showed no preference for one blue mussel
species over the other. The preference for M. trossulus by N. ostrina might be because this
species was collected farther north where M. trossulus is more abundant than M.
galloprovincialis, and the whelks may have been conditioned to feed upon the native mussel
(Braby and Somero 2006). These results suggest the need for further studies.
