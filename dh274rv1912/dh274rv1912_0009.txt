different species and a positive value represented conspecific associations. Values for each
species in all containers (five for no predation and three for predation) of a combination were
pooled, a mean value was calculated, and then a p-value was generated using a Student's t-test.
Solitary mussels constituted only a small proportion of the observed data (average of 1-2 per
trial), and thus were not included in the analysis. For clump size, I conducted a two-way
ANOVA with the orthogonal factors of species composition and predation/no predation. To
detect a difference in Nucella prey preferences, I ran another two-way ANOVA with mussel
species and whelk species as the two factors.
3. Results
3.1. Mytilus Aggregation Experiment
For the aggregation trials under natural (predator-free) seawater conditions, all the
species, except for M. galloprovincialis when paired with M. californianus, yielded values
significantly different from zero after 120 hours. This translates into each mussel species
touching a disproportionate number of one species (Fig. 2; t-test, p£0.01). Looking at the average
divergence from zero (being no preference), the data are skewed in the negative direction,
indicating a preference for the congener.
3.2. Predator-Influenced Aggregation Experiment
Under predator-influenced conditions, only the M. californianus and M. galloprovincialis
combination demonstrated a significant preference for the other species (Fig. 3; t-test, p£0.01).
This can be seen clearly from the distribution of the means around zero. Clump size, however,
differed in the presence or absence of a predator (Fig. 4; two-way ANOVA, Fi, 14 = 11.91, p -
0.0039). A Studentized-Neuman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc test revealed that the mixed species
