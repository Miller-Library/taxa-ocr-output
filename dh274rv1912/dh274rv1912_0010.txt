combinations with M. trossulus all exhibited larger clump size in the presence of a predator than
without one (CV = 2.60, p«0.05, n = 3).
3.3. Nucella Feeding Experiment
In the feeding experiment, a significant interaction between whelk and mussel species
was identified (Fig. 5; two-way ANOVA, Fi,8 = 12.5, p = 0.008). Using an SNK post-hoc test, N.
emarginata did not demonstrate any identifiable preference between the invasive and the native
blue mussel. However, they also did not consume considerable amounts of mussels, potentially
due to mating requirements (Martel et al. 1986). Nucella ostrina demonstrated a preference for
M. trossulus over M. galloprovincialis (CV = 1.54, p50.05, n =3).
4. Discussion
4.1. Aggregation Experiment
Aggregation behavior in the Mytilus mussels can have far-reaching implications for
survival and fitness of individual species. Preference in neighbor is an interesting topic, due to
the different life history characteristics of different mussel species. Of the three species that
inhabit the central California coast, M. californianus, M. trossulus, and M. galloprovincialis all
exhibited a significant preference towards the opposite species. This result may have been an
artifact of my set-up, as each individual’s closest neighbors were of the opposite species;
however, the mussels were observed to move a great deal over the course of the 120 hours of
each trial. Behavior of the individual species of mussels within these mixed clumps may provide
insight into the success of the M. galloprovincialis invasion in the western United States and the
absence of M. trossulus in beds of M. californianus. These mixed species beds may result in
skewed ratios of species, one species potentially out-competing the other. In a study done along
