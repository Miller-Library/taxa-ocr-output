the aggregation behavior of M. trossulus, both in the absence and presence of a predator. To
further the knowledge of predation impacts, it also looks at the preference of native predatory
whelks, N. emarginata and N. ostrina, between the native and invasive blue mussel.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experimental Design
I observed the patterns of aggregation of different Mytilus species in laboratory
conditions. In a set of sequential experiments, I looked at how different combinations of M.
trossulus, M. galloprovincialus, and M. californianus sorted out into aggregations, under ambient
sea-water conditions and in the presence of a predator. During the months of May and June 2007,
each individual trial took place over five days, during which aggregations were mapped daily. As
a side experiment, I conducted a feeding preference experiment with two species of whelks,
Nucella emarginata and N. ostrina. Consisting of three replicates of each species, this study
occurred over four weeks in May.
Nucella emarginata were collected at Hopkins Marine Station and N. ostrina were
collected at Bodega Bay, CA. M. californianus were collected at Hopkins Marine Station, CA,
M. trossulus were supplied from the South Jetty in Florence, OR, and M. galloprovincialus were
brought up from Santa Barbara harbor, CA. All of the mussels collected were of comparable size
and measured between 28 and 42 mm. Both the N. ostrina and M. californianus were marked
with Orly Salon Nails“ Orange Flash nail polish and a coat of Scotch Super Glue"" Liquid,
whereas the M. galloprovincialus were painted with Wet 'n' Wild Flirty Rose Crème nail polish
and the same overcoat. M. trossulus remained unpainted.
