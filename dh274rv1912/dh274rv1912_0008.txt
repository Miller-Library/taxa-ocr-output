sea water. The containers were elevated above an aquarium table so that water could spill over.
As with the other aggregation experiments, I mapped the position of each mussel relative to the
others. I also recorded the frequency of different clump sizes.
2.4. Nucella Feeding Experiment
Although not an aggregation experiment, the predation study complemented the
predation aggregation experiment. Six 5.7-L containers (Holiday Housewares, Inc; Visuals'M
Deluxe Clear Storage), each with nine -1 cm holes drilled into either side to facilitate water
flow, acted as the environment to house the species under scrutiny. Also placed on an aquarium
table filled with running sea water, three tanks held N. ostrina and three held N. emarginata. The
sets of three containers were separated so that all three of one species of whelk were grouped
together. Then two small Petri dishes each containing five randomly selected M. trossulus and
five M. galloprovincialis were placed in each container along with four whelks of the appropriate
species.
Daily observations consisted of noting any whelks positioned on top of a mussel, which
species of mussel had been targeted and/or eaten, and where on the shell the whelk drilled. I
began the study at the beginning of May. After two weeks, I replaced any eaten mussels so that
the whelks had access to equal numbers of each species for the final two weeks of the
experiment. At the end of each two-week period, I recorded how many of each mussel species
were eaten by each species of whelk.
2.5. Data Analysis
For the aggregation experiments, mussel preference was measured by taking the
difference between the number of conspecifics and congeners that each mussel was touching. I
calculated this value for each mussel, so that a negative value indicated a preference for a
