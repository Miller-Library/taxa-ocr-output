Mytilus galloprovincialis continues to work its way up the California coast (Braby and
Somero 2006). Since variation in predation intensity depends on wave exposure, recruitment of
prey, and growth of the mussel, location will affect which mussels thrive and which predators are
present (Dolmer 1998). Therefore, because blue mussels tend to be excluded from the high-
energy zones of the California coast, they may not experience the intense predation pressures
that were present in this study. Further study is necessary to determine the effect of whelk
predation on natural populations of blue mussels. There are probably additional behavioral and
physiological factors influencing the success of the invasive species as a competitor of the
native, and these should also be researched in future studies to obtain a clearer picture of the
consequences of interspecific interactions.
Acknowledgments
I would like to my advisor, George Somero, for all of his advice, guidance, and wealth of
information. His passion for science and the marine system and ideas for various studies made
my project more interesting and kept me motivated. All the members of the Somero lab were
equally supportive - most notably Brent Lockwood for collecting N. emarginata for me and
offering his mussel expertise and encouragement, and Jon Sanders for assistance in technical
aspects of my experiment and for collecting M. galloprovincialis. Also, Eric Sanford played a
pivotal role in the project, providing N. ostrina and M. trossulus and acting as another source of
mussel information. Finally, I want to recognize Jim Watanabe for his extensive statistical
knowledge and help with my data analysis.
