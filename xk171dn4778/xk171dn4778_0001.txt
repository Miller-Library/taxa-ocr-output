Abstract
In the rocky intertidal of the Monterey region, the slipper limpet Crepidula adunca is
Ã  common inhabitant of the shells of Tegula funebralis. In the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge,
13% of Tegula funebralis are host to Crepidula adunca. Sixty-three percent of Crepidula
are found alone on Tegula shells, while 37% of Crepidula are on Tegula that are host to at
least one other Crepidula as well.
Initial lab experiments to determine movement rate of Crepidula between hosts
showed that 16% of Crepidula moved at least once, 100% of whom were male.
Experiments were then set up to determine what motivated male Crepidula to move. Males
were removed from their original hosts and reattached on new hosts, then placed in replicate
tanks containing Tegula with either no Crepidula or specific combinations of male and/or
female Crepidula. Results of 19 replicates show that on average, 48% of Crepidula
movements were to Tegula containing female Crepidula, 33% were to Tegula containing no
Crepidula, and only 12% were to Tegula containing only male Crepidula. Results suggest
that movement of male Crepidula was influenced by the presence of female Crepidula on
the host snail, but this can not be isolated as the sole cause of movement. Other factors in
Crepidula movement, such as overall abundance of male Crepidula on a host snail and
chance events (such as rate of Tegula movement and Crepidula encounter) remain to be
investigated.
