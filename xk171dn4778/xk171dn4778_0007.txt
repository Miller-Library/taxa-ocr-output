and density had on the impetus to switch hosts. There were 20 Crepidula and 20 Tegula
present in the tank, so that if preference to be alone was a cause of movement, each
Crepidula would have its own snail to move onto.
Results and Discussion
Intertidal Distributions
Data from the Hopkins transect were categorized according to intertidal height
(Table 1). Both Tegula and Crepidula occur in greater abundance in the lower intertidal
zones and the number of Crepidula is proportional to the number of Tegula at any given
height (Fig.1). Out of the 2455 Tegula that I collected from the intertidal, 312 (13%) were
host to at least one Crepidula.
Sixty three percent of Crepidula were found alone while 37% shared their host snail
with at least one additional Crepidula. Further breakdown shows that of these, 22% were
stacked and 15% were not (Fig. 2). This raised the question as to why a particular
Crepidula chose its host snail and what the rate of movement was between shells.
Initial Movement Experiments
Sixteen percent (15/96) of Crepidula in the tank moved at least once during the
experiment (Table 2). One-hundred percent of Crepidula that moved were male. Possible
reasons for this include the role of the male as the mobile partner for reproduction, or that
only the male is able to move because the female is too large and fits too tightly to its host
snail.
