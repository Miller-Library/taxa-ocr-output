males (Table 4). The table shows the percentage from each category that moved (those that
did not move are not included) and whether they moved to be alone, with females, or with
only males.
Approximately the same number of males moved regardless of their begin position
(Table 4). Several movement percentages show patterns which support the reproduction
hypothesis. Among all the Crepidula, males that began alone or with other males were the
most likely to move to be with females. This holds true regardless of their source in the
intertidal. Male Crepidula that were originally collected with females and that started the
experiment with males were the most likely to move to be with females, as well as male
Crepidula that were originally collected alone or with other males and that began alone or
with other males (Table 4). These results are consistent with the reproduction hypothesis
since males showed an inclination to be with females.
Looking at the table, there are also patterns of movement which are contradictory to
the reproduction hypothesis. Among all males, Crepidula starting alone or with females
were most likely to move to be alone, which rather than supporting the reproduction
hypothesis, supports the hypothesis of movement for reasons of density (i.e. to be alone)
general, Crepidula that began with females had the most even distribution of movement
among the three choices (Table 4). That they moved almost as much as males that began
with other males or alone questions the reproduction hypothesis because we would expect
them to stay with the females more than those from the other staring positions.
The results tend to support the reproduction hypothesis, but there are enough
contradictory patterns to suggest that additional factors may be involved. Total density of
Crepidula on a host appears to have little effect: there is little increase in percent movement
