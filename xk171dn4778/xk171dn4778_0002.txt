Introduction
It is not uncommon in the marine world to find organisms living in host-guest
relations with one another. One such example in the rocky intertidal zone of Monterey Bay
is the interaction between Crepidula adunca (commonly known as the slipper snail) and its
snail host, Tegula fune bralis (hereaster they will be referred to as Crepidula and Tegula
respectively). This study examined why and how Crepidula chose their host snail.
Crepiduld are sequential hermaphrodites, which means they reproduce as one sex (in
this case males) early in life, then change to the other sex for the remainder of their life span
(Hobday 1997). Crepidula shell size increases as a function of time, the sex of an individual
is correlated with its size. Males are often found stacked on top of females - this is the
position necessary for copulation (Charnov 1982). Hobday (1997) studied the movement of
Crepidula based on reproductive potentials, hypothesizing that social situation can affect the
time of male-female transition. That is, if a male is in the presence of females, it may
change to a female later than if it were alone, in order to maximize its reproductive potential.
This means that the sex of a Crepidula cannot be determined solely by its size. Later in this
paper à precise way of determining the sex of a Crepidula will be explained in further detail
Crepidula are filter feeders and can live in a sedentary state indefinitely. Vermeii et
al. (1987) studied the interaction between Crepidula adunca on the host snail Calliostoma
ligatum and showed that Crepidula who had been moved from their host shell and
reattached were more likely to be attacked by predators since they no longer had as close a
fit. Crepidula shell size increases as a function of time. Therefore the fit of a Crepidula on
à host improves with time. Movement therefore makes them more vulnerable to predators
