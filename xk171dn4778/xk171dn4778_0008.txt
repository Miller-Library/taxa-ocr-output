Among the 15 Crepidula that moved, there were 26 movements: 12 (46%) to Tegula
containing female Crepidula, 11 (42%) to bare Tegula, and 3 (12%) to Tegula whose shells
were already inhabited by other male Crepidula (Table 2). These results led to two
hypotheses as to why male Crepidula are moving. The first is for reproductive reasons -
nearly half of all males moved to host Tegula with females. The second hypothesis is that
Crepidula prefer not to be in the company of other Crepidula and move to shells where they
are alone. This hypothesis is supported by the data that 42% of movements resulted in a
Crepidula being alone on a host snail. These hypotheses were tested in the next set of
experiments.
Secondary (choice) Movement Experiments
Results from these experiments are presented in three ways: total movement of all
experimental Crepidula, movement of males that had been collected in the field from hosts
with female, and movement of males that had been collected alone or with other males (but
not females) in the intertidal. This was done to determine whether males that had begun
with females were more likely to move back with females than those that had no immediate
prior association with females.
The percent movement from any given starting position to a particular end position is
shown as a row percentage (Table 3). Those Crepidula that were least likely to move began
alone on females, which is expected based on the reproduction hypothesis.
In order to better interpret movement patterns related to the reproduction hypothesis. I
combined data from the five begin categories into 3 starting positions: alone, with females
(males could have been present so long as females were present as well), and with only
