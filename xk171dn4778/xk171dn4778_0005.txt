Crepidula were color-coded to match their host snail in order to track movement.
Organisms were painted with nail polish on the tip of their shell where Crepidula could not
attach to.
At the completion of the experiment, Crepidula were removed from their hosts and
placed under a microscope (in water) to determine their sex (so as to categorize their
movement by sex). Male Crepidula have a penis protruding immediately right of the right
cephalic tentacle. Females lack a penis, and Crepidula in the transition stage of becoming a
female from a male have a stunted penis, which can very in length according to their stage in
the transition process.
Secondary Movement Experiments
These experiments were set up to determine what factors lead to movement of
Crepidula between hosts. Experiments were run for 24 hours with a total of 19 experiments.
Experiments were run in tanks identical to the previous set of experiments. Tanks were
placed in different positions on the sea table every day to eliminate variation between tanks.
Each day they were run, the tanks were subdivided into two groups based on the
source of male Crepidula. Two tanks contained males that had been collected from hosts
which also contained female Crepidula. Two tanks contained males collected from hosts
where no females had been present (i.e. they were alone on the snail or in the company of
other male Crepidula). Ten tanks were run with males that had been found without females
in the environment; nine tanks contained males that had formerly been on snails with
