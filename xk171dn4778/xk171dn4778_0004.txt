Osing a 23m? quadrat I collected all of the Tegula located within the quadrat and
took them back to the lab. Ithen categorized them according to shell size and noted whether
they had Crepidula present, the size of the Crepidula, whether the Crepidula were present in
multiples or stacked, whether there were other limpets present on the snail, and whether the
shell contained a hermit crab. These data provided a picture of the organisms abundance
and patterns of their behavior and location within the intertidal.
Shell size of Tegula was measured with calipers and the shell was measured by as
maximum basal diameter. Crepidula shell size was measured by basal length as it sat on its
host Tegula.
Initial Movement Experiments
These experiments tested if Crepidula were capable of moving from host to host, and
ir so, with what frequency they did so. Tegula with and without Crepidula were collected
from mid-intertidal zones and placed in tanks. The experiment was run twice, once over six
days, and once over five, with four tanks present in each run. Tanks contained Tegula with
Crepidula in the following ratios: Ismall (l-3mm), 3 medium (4-Imm), and 2 large
CSmm) Crepidula, though absolute numbers differed among tanks. Each tank always
contained as many or more Tegula as Crepidula.
Tanks were 32 x 16 x 8 cm and contained between 11 and 24 snails. These numbers
were approximately equal to the number of organisms found in an area in the intertidal of
the same dimensions. Tanks were provided with running seawater and snails were disturbed
once a day while data were recorded, but were otherwise lest alone. They received no food
during the experiment.
