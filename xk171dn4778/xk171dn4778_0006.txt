female Crepidula present. Results are presented as aggregate totals, as well as in
subdivisions based on the source of the males.
Each tank contained the same number of Crepidula and Tegula. Male Crepidula
were removed from their hosts and reattached to new hosts prior to placement in a tank.
Females were not removed so that movement of males would not be influenced by poor fit
or injury of a female that had been displaced. Removal of females increases their mortality.
as females tend to die more quickly when removed from their original host (Hobday 1997).
Females were identified by their large size (generally greater than 9mm) and all males were
examined under a microscope to ensure that they were full males, and not juveniles or males
in transition to becoming females. Each tank contained 15 male Crepidula and 5 female
Crepidula in the following arrangement on host snails:
3 Tegula contained one solitary male Crepidula each.
2 Tegula contained 3 male Crepidula each.
2 Tegula contained 1 female Crepidula each.
I Tegula contained 1 female Crepidula and 1 male Crepidula stacked on top of the
female.
1 Tegula contained 1 female Crepidula and 2 males stacked on top if it.
1 Tegula contained 1 female, 1 male stacked on the female, and 2 additional males
on the Tegula.
10 Tegula contained no Crepidula.
At the end of 24 hours, the position of all males was recorded.
These combinations provided a mix of situations based on gender of Crepidula and
abundance (density) of Crepidula on each snail in order to observe effects that reproduction
