as they grow larger and it would seem logical were they to move solely for reproduction
Putnam (1964) studied the dispersal of young Crepidula adunca from Tegula funebralis and
found that while 150-200 young are released from a female on one host, eight is the
masimum number of Crepidula ever seen on one legula shell. She concludes that young
must therefore be moving to neu hosts. In preliminary experiments to determine impetus
for movement, Putnam (1964) discovered that uhen removed from their hosts, "adult males
are atracted by legula sunebralis, but even more strongly by female C. adanco. In contrast.
tne newly hatched spat do not apear to be strongly attracted to either T. funebralis or to
older C. adumncd, male or female" She concluded that juvenies move about at random and
afe only " weakly attacted to either T funebrals or older C. adunca, his attraction is clearby
present in older individuals.
Though Putnam (1964) states that atraction of males to females is clearly present in
older individuals, she fails to give substantial proof to support this claim. This study was
conducted to determine if and how osten Crepidula adunca moved fom its host snail, and
the impetus for movement.
Materials and Methods.
Teguld and Crepidula distribution in the intertidal.
In order to determine abundance and distribution of Crepidula in the intertidal. I
sampled organisms from a transect perpendicular to Agasiz beach in the Hopkins Marine
Lite Refuge. Along this transect I collected organisms from 10 quadrats. Tidal heights for
each quadrat were measured with a surveyor's transit and stadia rod, relative to the predicted
level of low tide.
