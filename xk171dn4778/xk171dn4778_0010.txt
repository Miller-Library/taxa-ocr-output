as density increases (column three in Table 5). A noteworthy entry is that of males who
began with one female. These males were significantly less likely to move, which rather
than support a hypothesis of density (in which case they would have moved to be alone)
supports that of reproduction. However, the data for two males beginning with a female
shows that they were as likely to move as those males who began with two other males,
which suggests that some factor besides reproduction, whether density or otherwise, may
play a role here.
The results from these experiments suggest that movement of Crepidula adunca
between Tegula funebralis is influenced by the presence of female Crepidula. These results
support by Putnam (1964) and her studies on dispersal of young, and studies by Hobday
(1997) of social situation as it affects movement and sex change. However, contradictions
in the data suggest that movement is influenced by other factors as well, possibly including
(but not limited to) density and chance events. Chance events include factors such as the
density of Tegula and Crepidula in a certain area of the intertidal and the rate at which
Tegula come in contact with one another. Further studies are needed to determine how
reproduction and other factors interact to cause movement of Crepidula between Tegula
shells.

I would like to thank Hopkins Marine Station and especially my advisor Jim
Watanabe for all his help and early mornings in the tidal pools. I would also like to thank
Jess Davy and other spring students for their help with data collection and for making it a
great spring quarter.
