The generally consistent recoveries for the
four separate aliquots showed that the average re-
covery percentages were true indications o the coÂ¬
lumn efficiency under the conditions of the experi-
ment with samples that did not contain shell material.
These figures disagree with the results of Riley and
Taylor (1968) and Davey et al. (1970) who reported 100%
or very close to 100% recovery for all the metals.
Riley et al. and Davey et al., however, used differ-
ent forms of the resin and under different experimen-
tal conditions (with generally higher ph for their
samples). The conditions under which this experiment
was carried out were those specified by J. Galloway
(personal communication to George Knauer) who held
that a sample pH of between 5.5 and 7.5 would not in-
terfere with column efficiency at the 100% level.
B. Recovery of trace metals from a standard solution con-
taining known concentrations of Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and
Cd, and known amounts of shell material, after it has
been passed through a Chelex-100 column.
Methods.
The remaining right halves of those three mussels
from which M-1, M-2 and M-3 were obtained were crushed
and dissolved as previously described, obtaining a
single solution of 100 ml. From this solution, three
20 ml aliquots were drawn. These were coded as Blank
1, Shell 1 and Shell 2.
Three 25 ml aliquots were then withdrawn from
the SM-stock solution and these were coded as Shell 3,
Shell 4 and Shell 5.
