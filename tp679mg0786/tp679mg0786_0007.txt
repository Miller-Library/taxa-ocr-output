still more water. This procedure was repeated to give the
Chelex its final, purified, ammonium form. The Chelex in
its ammonium form was then packed into 12 mm diameter
glass tubes to give a column length of 6 cm.
The rate of flow of the neutralized samples through the
column was adjusted to be not more than one drop every two
seconds. The columns were then rinsed with 100 ml of dis-
tilled water and the 20 ml of a buffer solution of ammo-
nium acetate. This buffer was a one to one mixture of a 7.5N
ammonium hydroxide solution and a 50% aqueous solution of
glacial acetic acid. 40 ml of 4N nitric acid was then used
to elute the columns. The elutants were concentrated by
evaporation under suction as previously described so as to
obtain a final volume of 5 ml. The Perkin-Elmer 303 was
used in conjunction with a Perkin-Elmer 165 Recorder to mea-
sure the levels of the following metals in the final 5 ml
solutions: Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Cd. The solutions were also
checked at a wavelength of 222 nm with the lead electrode
for any scattering.
Results and Discussions.
Part of theresults are shown in Table 3.
Cobalt could not be found in any of the samples, nor
in the blank. There was no scattering at all for all sam-
ples, including the blank. The following concentrations of
metals were found in the blank solution: .03 ppm Pb,2.3 ppm
Cu, 5.1 ppm Zn, and 0.7 ppm Cd. Since the blank readings
were proportionately deducted from the samples to obtain
the final adjusted levels in the dry shell, contamination
