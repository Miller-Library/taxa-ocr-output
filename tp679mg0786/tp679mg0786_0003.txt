I. Determination of the loss of metals from solution during
concentration by evaporation:
Materials and Methods.
Standard solutions containing Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co
and Cd were prepared by serial delutions from parent
stock solutions (Harleco +7633) in the following concen-
trations: 0.5 ppm, 1.0 ppm, 5.0 ppm, 10.0 ppm. These
were all made in 4N nitric acid and were later referred
to as 0.5 ppm standard, 1.0 ppm standard, etc..
Fifty ml of a solution containing 1.0 ppm of Pb, Mn,
Cu, Zn, Co and Cd was made by diluting 5 ml of a 10.0 ppm
standard in a 50 ml volumetric flask. This i ppm solution
was then transferred to a 50 ml beaker and gently heated,
without boiling. To prevent contamination and to avoid
refluxing, a cleaned filter funnel, connected to an aspira-
tor with Tygon tubings, was inverted over the beaker. When
the solution reached a volume of slightly less than 10 ml,
it was removed from the heat, with the funnel still in-
verted over it, and allowed to cool to room temperature.
The volume of the solution in the beaker had reached a
level below 5 ml by this time. The contents of the beakei
was poured into a 5 ml volumetric flask. The sides of the
beaker were washed with 4N nitric acid and the washings
added to the 5 ml flask. More acid was then added to bring
the final volume to precisely 5 ml. This should result in
a 5 ml solution of 10.0 ppm, provided the evaporation had
not resulted in the loss of any metals from solution. The
entire procedure was repeated three times to obtain three
