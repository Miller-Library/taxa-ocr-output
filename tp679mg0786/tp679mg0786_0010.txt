All the aliquots, except Blank i, were spiked with
5 ml of the same 5 ppm standard solution used earlier.
They were all neutralized, including Blank 1, and then
passed through the Chelex column and analyzed for Pb,
Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and Cd.
Results and Discussions:
The results are shown in Table 4(b).
Since Blank 1, Shell i and Shell 2 were drawn from
the same shell solution and since Blank i was not spiked
with standard solution, then Blank i was considered a va-
lid shell blank for Shell 1 and Shell 2 so as to correct
for the contributions from the shells. The amounts of
the various trace metals for the SM-stock, from which
Shell 3. Shell 4 and Shell 5 were obtained had already
been determined by three separate analyses (of SM-stock 1,
SM-stock 2 and SM-stock 3; see Table 3). The averages
for the various metals in SM-stock 1, SM-stock 2 and SM-
stock 3 were taken to be shell blank values for Shell 3,
Shell 4 and Shell 5. This average was coded as Blank 2.
Corrected values for each metal for the Shell i and Shell
2 samples were obtained by deducting the values for Blank
1 from the average values of Shell i and Shell 2; and by
deducting the values for Blank 2 from the averages of
Shell 3. Shell 4 and Shell 5. Then the corrected averages
for Shell i and Shell 2; and Shell 3, Shell 4, and Shell5
were pooled to obtain a final corrected average for all
samples with shell materials from which the percentage
recovery was calculated (see first line of Table 5).
