'M-stock'. The five individual half-shells from San Ma-
teo were coded 'SM-1', 'SM-2', 'SM-3', 'SM-4' and 'SM-5'.
The five individuals half-shells from Monterey were simi-
larly coded as 'M-1', 'M-2', 'M-3', 'M-4', and 'M-5'.
The data on shell weight and the amounts of reagents
used are shown in Table 2.

Materials and Methods.
Three aliquots of 25 ml each were withdrawn from SM-
stock and similarly three 25 ml aliquots were obtained from
M-stock resulting in the following sample solutions: SM-
stock 1, SM-stock 2, SM-stock 3; M-stock i, M-stock 2, and
M-stock 3. A blank was made with 10 ml of 12N hydrochloric
acid, 15 ml of 20N nitric acid and 18 drops of the 33% hy-
drogen peroxide (This corresponds to the total amount of
acids and H202 added to the M-stock aliquots and twice the
amounts added to the SM-stock aliquots.)
All the solutions (SM-stock 1 through 3, M-stock i
through 3; SM-1 through 5 and M-1 through 5) were neutra-
lized to a pH of 7.0 + 0.1 with 15N ammonium hydroxide and
then passed through a Chelex-100 column.
The chelating resin, Chelex-100, is a purified form
of Dowex A-1. A 50-100 mesh particle size was used. The
resin was purified by washing with distilled water, iN hy-
drochloric acid, more water, iN ammonium hydroxide, and
