The values do indicate that column efficiency (as
measured by the percentage recovery figures in Table 5)
was much reduced in the presence of shell materials, exÂ¬
cept in the case of lead. Since work done by Riley and
Taylor (1968) indicated that 100% recovery was possible
from the Chelex-100 column with large quantities of ses-
water, it is unlikely that the reduction in efficiency
was due to the carbonates present in the shell solutions.
A more likely reason is perhaps that the organic subs-
tances present in the mussel shells might have compli-
cated the chelating properties of the resin, resulting
in one or more of the following:
(a) metallic ions adhering to organic substances in the
shell samples so strongly that they were not able
to chelate with the resin;
(b) the ability of the column to retain ions was reduced
(perhaps by organic substances in the shell samples)
thus not all of the heavy metal ions were trapped
when the sample solution was passed through it.
(c) the very opposite of (b), namely, that the resin
bound so strongly withthe ions that they were not
completely eluded with the amounts of elutant used.
A possible explanation for the less than 100% re-
covery of the column in both cases (with and without the
shell material) is that at the sample pH (7.0 f 0.1),
the column did not have 100% retention capabilities.
