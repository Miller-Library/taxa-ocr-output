hydrochloric acid elutant.
(c) A sample pH of 7.8 was much closer to the optimum ph
for complete recovery than a pH of 7.0
VI. Determination of contamination inherent in the 15N ammonium
hydroxide:
Reagent grade ammonium hydroxide, of the same kind that was
used for neutralizing all the sample solutions, was analyzed
for Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and Cd. It was found that the 15N
ammonium hydroxide contained .4ppm Pb, .5ppm Zn, .2ppm Co
and.2ppm cadmium. Since ammonium hydroxide was extensive-
ly used in all samples which were subsequently concentrated
ten-fold, this inherent contamination by heavy metals could
be a very important source of contamination. Further-
more, the amounts of ammonium hydroxide needed varied from
sample to sample, thus adding an increased degree of variance
to the results.
Summary:
(1) Analyses of Mytilus edulis shell for the trace metals
Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and Cd using atomic absorption spectroÂ¬
photometry is difficult because of scattering effects at
low wavelengths. To eliminate these interferences, experi-
ments were performed with the use of an ion-exchange resin
column of Chelex-100 with the result that scattering was
completely eliminated from the samples of shells.
(2) A method of concentrating a solution of trace metals by
evaporation under suction was developed. This method re-
sulted in a 100% recovery of all trace metals from a solu-
tion that had been concentrated ten times. This in effect
increased the detection limit of the atomic absorption spec-
