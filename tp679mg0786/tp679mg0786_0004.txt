5 ml solutions of a theoretical concentration of 10.0 ppm:
Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3. These samples were then run
on the Perkin-Elmer 303 atomic absorption spectrophotome-
ter for the following metals: Pb, Mn, Cu and Cd.
Results and Discussions.
The results are shown in Table 1.
It is evident that the method for concentrating a sam-
ple solution ten-fold by means of evaporation under suction
had not resulted in any appreciable loss of Pb, Mn, Cu or
Cd from the solution; nor did the 4N nitric acid that was
used as a blank contain any measurable quantities of these
metals.
Thus the technique described provided an acceptable
way of concentrating a solution of trace metals down by a
factor of ten without any measurable loss of metals, thus
resulting in an effective increase of the detection limit
of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer by the same fac-
tor.
II. Collection and preparation of samples:
Materials and Methods.
Fifty-eight Mytilus edulis were collected from the in-
tertidal area of Coyote Point Recreational Area, San Mateo,
California on May 14, 1971. Fifty-five mussels were col-
lected from the wood pilings in the U.S. Coast Guard pier
at Monterey, California, on May 18, 1971. All of the mus-
sels were collected from the highest levels in their range
of distribution in both localities and they were all col -
lected from spots not more than ten feet from each other.
