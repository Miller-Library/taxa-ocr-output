(3) At a sample pH of 7.0, the Chelex column used had a
generally higher percentage recovery for solutions of trace
metals without shell material than for solutions with shell
material.
(4) Recovery percentage from the column for all the trace
metals involved was much higher at sample pH of 7.8 than
that at sample pH of 7.0.
(5) Reagent contamination resulted in some inaccuracies in
the values for some trace metals in the shells of Mytilus
edulis, especially copper and zinc. Nhen the concentra-
tions of some of the trace metals in the mussel shell are
so low, contamination becomes an all-important considera-
tion. Furthermore, the varying amounts of the inherently
contaminated ammonium hydroxide used in the samples added
an increased degree of variance to the results.
