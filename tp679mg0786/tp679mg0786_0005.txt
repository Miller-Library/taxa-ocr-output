The mussels were cut open with a stainless steel blade
and the flesh was discarded. The shells were scrubbed with
a sponge pad and, when necessary, any barnacles and algae
were scraped off with the stainless steel blade. They were
then rinsed in tap water and oven-dried at 80Â°C overnight.
In all but two cases, only the left half of the mussel
shell was used.
Fifty-three half-shells from San Mateo were crushed in
a large beaker with the fingers to pieces of about 1 to 2
cm long and the dry weight of the shell fragments was de-
termined. The other five mussels from San Mateo were simi-
larly crushed and weighed, but individually. For the mus-
sels from Monterey, fifty were pooled and the remaining
five individuals were crushed and weighed in separate bea-
kers.
To dissolve the shells, first 12N hydrochloric acid
was added 5 ml at a time until there was no vigorous effev-
escence. Then 20N nitric acid was added, again 5 ml at a
time, to dissolve the remaining protein coat on the shells.
Towards the end, and only then, the mixture was warmed
slightly. A watchglass was placed over the beaker at all
times. A few drops of 33% hydrogen peroxide were then added
to oxidize any organic substances until the solution was
clear of visible particulate matter.
The solution of 53 half-shells from San Mateo was made
up to 500 ml with distilled water in a volumetric flask.
This was coded 'SM-stock'. The solution of 50 half-shells
from Monterey was made up to 250 ml, and this was coded
61.
