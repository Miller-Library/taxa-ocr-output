of the blank could very conceivably have resulted in aber-
rations of the copper and zinc concentrations especially.
Because of the high concentrations of Pb, Mn and Cd relaÂ¬
tive to what was found in the blank, the values for these
metals are regarded to be dependable and accurate. However,
the values for these trace metals did not necessarily re-
present the absolute levels found in the shells since there
was no evidence to indicate that, given the conditions of
this experiment, the column had 100% retention and/or 100%
recovery.
IV. Determination of column efficiency:
A. Recovery of trace metals from a standard solution con-
taining known concentrations of Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and
Cd, but no shell material, after it has been passed
through a Chelex-100 column.
Methods.
Four 5 ml aliquots of a standard solution contain-
ing 5 ppm of all the relevant trace metals were with-
drawn and these were coded Standard 1, Standard 2, Stan-
dard 3 and Standard 4. These were neutralized to a ph
of 7.0 + 0.1 and then run through the Chelex column and
analyzed as before.
Results and Discussions.
The results are shown in Table 4(a).
The percentage recovery, obtained by comparing the
actual concentration to the expected concentration of 5
ppm, is shown for each metal in the last line of Table 5.
