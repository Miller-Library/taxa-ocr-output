10 ppm of Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and Cd, one at pH 7.0 and the
other at ph 7.8 (these were coded Sample A and Sample B
respectively), were run through the Chelex column accord-
ing to the same procedures outlined in III. The buffer
solution of ammonium acetate was used with Sample A but it
was not used in the case of Sample B.
After the columns had been eluted with 4N nitric acid,
they were eluted again with 20 ml of 2N hydrochloric acid.
The distilled water that had been passed through the columns
were kept and concentrated down; so were the 4N and 2N acid
elutants.
Results and Discussions.
The results are shown in Table 6.
Percentage recovery values can easily be obtained from
the 'Total' values in Table 6 by taking into consideration
the fact that the expected concentration should be 10 ppm
for all the metals involved.
It is obvious that the percentage recovery for Sample B
was much better than those for Sample A. The implications
of this are many:
(a) Distilled water is carrying off some copper and zinc so
perhaps its pH should be adjusted to near neutral or
slightly basic conditions (pH of distilled water used
was found to be between 5.4 and 5.8)
(b) In Sample B, where the column was exposed to a heavier
load, the 40 ml of nitric acid elutant did not seem to
be adequate for complete recovery of the trace metals
since appreciable amounts were founds in the second 2N
