passing it through an ion-exchange chelating column of
Chelex-100. They have, with remarkable success, been
able to effectively separate the trace metals from its
inorganic matrices (Riley et al. 1968).
The purpose of this paper is to introduce an as yet
imperfect technique for using the Chelex column in a si-
milar way to selectively extract certain trace metals,
concentrate the elutant from the column by as much as tenÂ¬
fold (thereby increasing the effective detection limit of
the atomic absorption spectrophotometer by a factor of ten)
and then determining their concentrations using the atomic
absorption spectrophotometer.
The Bay Mussel, Mytilus edulis, was selected because
of its easy availability and its generally wide distribu-
tions.
