such polar differences between the two tecta may indicate one method of determining the
direction of a light stimulus.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the behavioral and electrophysiological responses of adult male
zebrafish to a looming stimulus. Electrical activity at both the optic nerve and tectum in response
to sudden introduction and elimination of light showed that the on- and off-responses originate
from the retina. However, several significant differences in the waveforms elicited at the postÂ¬
synaptic layers of the tectum were observed, which might suggest the occurrence of higher-order
processing of on- and off- responses in the optic tectum.
Evidence of Higher-Order Tectal Processing
Visible signals recorded from the optic nerve in response to on- and off-events at all tested
durations of irradiation and interstimulus intervals show that neuron potentials elicited by sudden
illumination or darkening around the field of vision begin as early in the visual synaptic pathway
as the retina. This follows current consensus on the functional organization of retinal ganglion,
on-, and off- bipolar cells in mammals (Masland 2001) and teleosts (Daw 1968, Yang et al.
1988).
However, marked differences in waveforms and relative amplitudes were observed between
the signals recorded from the retina and optic tectum, which seems to indicate higher tectal
processing of the on- and off-stimulated signals from the ganglion cells. Signals may be
processed" at the tectum for any number of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the
visual stimulus, such as light intensity, diffusivity, duration, and orientation, as well as
integration of these various aspects. Additionally, differences between signals recorded from the
