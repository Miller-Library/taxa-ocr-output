opposite manner. The axonal projections of retinal ganglion cells aggregate to form the optic
nerve. In non-mammalian vertebrates, these axons synapse onto the optic tectum (Fig. 2). In fish,
the optic tectum is the largest center for visual processing and appears to play a significant role
in predator/prey discrimination by initiating either escape or hunting, respectively. The
mammalian analog of the optic tectum is known as the superior colliculus. Another group of
neurons connects the superior colliculus to the cerebral cortex, the primary visual center in
mammalian vertebrates that is absent in lower vertebrates. Interestingly, the number of retinal
fibers in the visual afferent pathway to the optic tectum decreases considerably from lower
vertebrates to mammals (Cajal 1995). From the optic tectum, signals are relayed to the pair of
Mauthner neurons that surround the brainstem (Zottoli 1987). Each Mauthner cell sends a
crossed projection to a group of motoneurons and simultaneously inhibits the M-cell located on
the opposite side of the fish. These motoneurons are responsible for the contraction of muscle
fibers along the entire length of the zebrafish flank, which ultimately creates a visible startle
response.
In this study, we recorded both behavioral and electrophysiological responses of zebrafish to
the looming stimulus. We stimulated on-center and off-center cells in the retina to create action
potentials that traveled along the optic nerve to the optic tectum, which were then measured
using electrophysiological techniques. Our objective was to resolve differences in the processing
of on- and off-responses in the optic nerve and at the optic tectum. By observing discrepancies in
shape, relative amplitude, and duration, we hoped to elucidate whether higher-order processing
of visual input occurs in the optic tectum of adult zebrafish.
