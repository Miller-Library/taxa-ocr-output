right and left hemispheres of the optic tectum may indicate independent processing at individual
tectal lobes.
The waves recorded from the ganglion nerve in response to the on- and off-light stimulus
exhibited approximately equal amplitudes at all tested durations of irradiance. Differences in
amplitude between the on- and off-stimulus were immediately apparent at the optic tectum. The
on-response was visibly weaker than the off-response at the right tectum, whereas the reverse
was observed at the left tectum. It is too early to postulate the functional significance of the
amplitude differences observed in the waves recorded from the retina and optic tectum.
Nevertheless, it is possible that such differences are the result of visual orientation and
directionality processing, since the ganglion cells from the left eye synapse primarily onto the
right optic tectum (the LED was positioned on the left side of the animal in this study). Any
amplitude differences between the right and left tectum are thus likely to be influenced strongly
by the position of the light source relative to the visual field of the zebrafish.
While at least two depolarization events occurred at the optic tectum at all tested durations of
irradiance (one in response to the on-stimulus and one in response to the off-stimulus), only one
depolarization event was recorded from the optic nerve at the flash duration at 100 ms. However,
durations of light longer than 100 ms produced distinct on- and off-responses at the optic nerve.
These observations suggest the presence of at least three different functional cell populations in
the ganglion, including on-center, off-center, and on-off response cells, in which on-off response
cell potentials are evoked by a brief flash of light (Monasterio et al. 1975). Accordingly, it
appears that the visual synaptic input to the optic tectum during a looming response derives
primarily from on- and off-response cells in the ganglion.
