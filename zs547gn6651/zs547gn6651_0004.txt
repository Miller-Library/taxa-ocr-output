Materials & Methods
Subjects
Adult zebrafish were bred in the lab or purchased from a commercial supplier and kept in
aerated tanks with flowing water at 28°C. Only males approximately 3-4 cm in body length were
used. Animal care and handling was conducted in accordance with guidelines established by
Stanford University
Behavioral Observations
Five zebrafish were placed in a tank measuring 24 cm 12 cm 16 cm with aerated water at
28°C and allowed to acclimate for at least 1 hour. The tank was surrounded on three sides by
black poster board and illuminated by ambient room light, as well as by a flashlight positioned
approximately 1 m above the water’s surface.
Shadows were created by swiftly interrupting the flashlight beam with a circular piece of
cardboard 10 cm in diameter. The shadow was presented every 10 seconds until a noticeable
decrease in animal response occurred. Behavioral responses were recorded by a high-speed
digital video recorder (Sony DSC-T1).
Retinal and Tectal Preparations
Prior to surgery, the zebrafish was isolated from the supply tank and immobilized
temporarily by hypothermic shock in an ice water bath. Skeletal muscle paralysis was induced by
an intramuscular injection of 0.1-0.3 mL of curare into the mid-lateral tail line.
Recordings from the retina and the tectum were performed in different fish. For retinal
experiments, the eye was isolated from the fish by gently pulling and severing the optic nerve
