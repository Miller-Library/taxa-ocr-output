As the flash duration was increased gradually, two distinct dips began to appear: an on-
response when the light appeared and an off-response when the light disappeared (Fig. 6). In
order to see the two separate troughs, however, it was necessary to increase the flash duration
past a certain threshold value. This ensured that the on- and off-responses did not overlap, which
occurred in the initial trial. Although both of these responses may have been present
physiologically at a flash duration of 100 ms, they were indistinguishable according to the
voltage recordings. In addition, the on- and off-responses were similar in magnitude over five
repetitions.
As the flash duration and interstimulus interval were increased further, it was noticed that
even with an increasing flash duration, the relative durations of both on- and off-reactions remain
constant, within an approximate range of 200 and 300 ms (Fig. 7).
Right Tectum
Due to the anatomical connections that link the retina to the brain in lower vertebrates, when
the LED was positioned more proximal to the left eye, the contralateral tectum received all of the
neuronal signals output by the left retina (Fig. 8). As a result, it was expected that signals
detected at the right tectum to correspond better to the stimulus being presented to the zebrafish
when compared to those measured at the left tectum.
When the same initial trial from the retinal experiment was repeated, two peaks became
visible in the right tectum, one that represented the on-response and another that represented the
off-response (Fig. 9). Moreover, the on- and off-responses appeared to be comparable in
magnitude given these baseline parameters. Even though the recordings from the right tectum
show slightly higher levels of electrical noise compared to those made in the optic nerve, the
overall shapes present in a series of flashes remain consistent over repeated trails.
