Comparisons of relative amplitudes of on- and off-responses as flash durations were
increased indicated that the size of the off-response relative to the on-response at both the left
and right optic tectum increased. In contrast, little to no increase was observed at the retina.
Thus, the off-evoked potential at the optic tectum appeared more pronounced as the fish was
exposed to longer periods of light. This suggests that the tectal processing of information
regarding dark-induced visual input from the retina is influenced by the time of light exposure
prior to the off-stimulus. Additional measurements of on- and off-responses to a short flash
duration (100 ms) were recorded immediately after measurements of responses to a series of
increasingly longer flash durations to confirm that the increases in the ratio of the off- and onÂ¬
response amplitudes were not the result of temporal habituation during repeated testing.
Off-Response Attenuation
The magnitude of consecutive off-responses decreased relative to the first off-response
within each experiment (5 repetitions per experiment), indicating the occurrence of habituation
to the looming stimulus. Attenuation of responses to shadows was also observed in the
behavioral experiments. While the occurrence of habituation in these studies suggests that
zebrafish may become less responsive to repeated appearances of shadows of predators from
overhead or may judge that such shadows do not represent imminent danger, this has yet to be
studied in natural habitats.
Limitations and Directions for Future Research
This study represents a preliminary investigation of the electrophysiological responses of
zebrafish to light-induced startle responses and is limited in several respects. Electrode
placement was determined largely by the position yielding the most visible signal and did not
