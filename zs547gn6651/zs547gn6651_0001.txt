Abstract
Although the functional role of the optic tectum has yet to be well characterized in teleosts, it
is thought to be responsible for initiating and coordinating visuomotor behaviors associated with
the looming response. In this study, behavioral and electrophysiological responses to the looming
stimulus were measured by differential suction electrodes at the optic tectum and retinal ganglion
cells of adult male zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). The looming stimulus was simulated by a
light-emitting diode and by increasing irradiance durations. Responses to off-light events were
found at both the retina and optic tectum, suggesting that light-induced startle responses begin as
early in the visual synaptic pathway as the retina. However, several differences in signal shape
and amplitude between recordings at these two regions suggest that higher-order visual
processing of on- and off-responses occurs at the optic tectum. Latency times were measured
between the presentation of the stimulus and the onset of the response, but data are currently
inconclusive. Habituation was observed through decreases in startle response as a function of
flash repetition. Future studies are necessary to correlate electrode position with signal strength
to resolve neural organization at the optic tectum. Ã–ther parameters such as flash duration,
interstimulus interval, and age of the zebrafish can also be varied to obtain a more complete
understanding of the startle response.
