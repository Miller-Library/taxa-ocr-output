was very sharp in its shape and persisted from 40 to 70 ms. This wave was followed by a slower,
shallower wave with a duration of around 130 ms. On the other hand, the off-response consisted
of a single, long wave of activity that ranged between 200 and 300 ms in length.
Latency periods were again compared over varying flash durations. At a flash duration of
100 ms and an interstimulus interval of 1900 ms, the average latency time for the ÖFF response
was approximately 15 ms. When flash duration was increased to 5 s, the corresponding latency
value was almost 200 ms. Similar to what occurred in the right tectum, the ON response latency
times ranged very little, between 15 and 20 ms.
Qualitative Comparisons
In comparing recordings made at the optic nerve and two optic tecta, on- and off-responses
were observed in all three locations. However, their relative magnitudes were found to be more
similar in the retina. Signals observed in the tecta consisted of double peaks, whereas those
measured in the retina consisted only of single peaks. The most distinct difference that was
noticed was the reversal of the relative magnitudes of the on- and off- responses between the
right and left tecta. In the right tectum, the off-response was considerably and consistently larger
in magnitude than the on-response that preceded it. In contrast, in the left tectum, the on¬
response was larger than the off-response, although not quite as consistently in comparison with
the right tectum.
Moreover, the shapes of on- and off- responses were more defined in the right tectum than in
the left tectum. Äfter a response was evoked, an extended series of several oscillations occurred
at the left optic tectum before baseline potentials were established. These fluctuations were
entirely absent in the right tectum. In addition, latency times for the OFF response decrease as a
function of flash duration in the right tectum, but increase in the left tectum. The presence of
