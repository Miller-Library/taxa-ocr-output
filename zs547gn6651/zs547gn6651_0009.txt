In addition, changes in latency times were analyzed to determine a relationship as a function
of flash duration. At a flash duration of 100 ms, the average latency period for the Ã–FF response
was 100 ms in the right tectum. When flash duration was extended to 5 s, however, the
corresponding latency value was only around 20 ms. For the on-response, latency times
remained relatively constant between 15 and 20 ms.
Left Tectum
Although the left optic tectum represented an ipsilateral configuration to the retina receiving
most of the light input, recordings made from the left tectum displayed strong activity that
corresponded to stimulus times. From our baseline trial with a flash duration of 100 ms, two
peaks with highly variable amplitudes over five repetitions were the result (Fig. 12), one for the
on-response and another for the off-response. The first peak was characterized by a high-
amplitude sharp wave, whereas the second peak was slower and less pronounced.
When flash duration was increased enough to distinguish between on- and off-responses, the
off-response was consistently smaller in magnitude than its associated on-response (Fig. 13). As
flash duration was increased further, off-responses increased disproportionately relative to their
corresponding on-responses until a flash duration of 10s was reached. However, the ratio of off-
responses to the first on-response of five successive repetitions showed no consistent trend over
repeated trials. Although differences in the relative amplitudes of on- and off-responses
increased with longer flash durations, they were not as significant as those observed in the right
optic tectum.
The components of both the on- and off-responses in the left tectum included a delay period
that lasted between 15 and 30 ms. However, the on-response contained two distinct peaks,
whereas the off-response involved only one such wave. Within the on-response, the first wave
