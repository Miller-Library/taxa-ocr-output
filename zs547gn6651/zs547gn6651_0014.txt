account for possible input biases resulting from the synaptic organization of the retina and optic
tectum. Comparisons of signals from different locations on the tectum may help provide a more
detailed understanding of the functional organization of the retina and optic tectum.
Furthermore, a number of parameters have yet to be studied, including responses to flash
durations of increased resolution, decreased interstimulus intervals, and from fish in different
stages of development. Also, measurements of latency may reveal more retinal and tectal
differences. While preliminary recordings seem to indicate a decrease in latency of the off-
response at the right optic tectum and an increase at the left optic tectum with increasing
durations of light, they are currently inconclusive and require a more accurate and standardized
measurement method. Additionally, the looming stimulus was produced only as square-wave
pulses of uniform light intensity in this study. It remains for future studies to employ variations
in the simulation of the looming stimulus.

We are deeply indebted to Professor Stuart Thompson for his expertise and guidance, without
which, this project would not have been possible. We also express our sincerest gratitude to
Christian Oâ€™Reilly and Chris Patton for their encouragement and assistance. Additionally, we
would like to thank all the members of the Thompson laboratory for their support and
