Experiments consisted of 5 repetitions of an irradiance interval followed by a darkness
interval (interstimulus interval). Light stimulus duration started at 100 ms and was incremented
to 2 minutes. Irradiance was preceded by a 100-ms delay and was followed by an interstimulus
interval totaling the irradiance and delay time in duration. Approximations for these parameters
were obtained and modified from Bullock (1990).
Electrical signals were sent to an AC differential amplifier with low-pass filtering of 1 Hz
and high-pass filtering of 1 kHz. The amplified signal (10,000â€”) was sent to an oscilloscope, a
DAT recording deck, and a computer. Measurements were recorded as single sweeps and as
averaged responses of five consecutive repetitions. Light frequencies were simultaneously
recorded by a DAT.
Results
In each figure, the lower schematic depicts when the flashes occurred: the LED is on
whenever the voltage is at a value significantly higher than the baseline. The upper diagram, on
the other hand, is the recording from the electrode placed either in the optic nerve or at the optic
tectum.
Optic Nerve
Recording from the retina was done from the distal stump of the optic nerve. A baseline flash
duration of 100 ms and interstimulus interval of 1900 ms was established (Fig. 5). From the
retina, only a single dip in response to each of the five light flashes was observed. Each of these
potentials lasted longer than the light flash itself and was relatively sharp in its characteristic
shape. The end of each signal was marked by hyperpolarization before the resting potential was
reached.
