As both the flash duration and interstimulus interval were lengthened, complex relationships
between flash duration, on-response, and off-response magnitude were observed. For example,
when the flash duration was increased from 100 ms to 5 seconds, the ratio between
corresponding off- and on-responses was almost 50 percent greater in magnitude (Fig. 10). As
flash duration was increased further, the off-response continued to grow relative to the on-
response, but the increases were not as apparent, and the off-response reached its maximum
amplitude at a flash duration of 10 seconds. The on-response also grew with longer flashes, but
only very slightly.
Once comparisons were made with regard to flash duration, patterns within a single trial of
five repetitions were examined. The observation that the off-response decays markedly as a
function of repetition number was made (Fig. 11). The greater the number of times our stimulus
is presented to the zebrafish, the smaller the magnitude of the resulting off-response. As it turns
out, within a set of five repetitions, there was an approximate 25 percent decrease in the
magnitude of the off-response as repetition number increases. The on-response, on the other
hand, was much more variable and showed both decreases and increases with repetition.
Both the on- and off-responses were characterized by a short delay period during which only
background electrical activity was measured, and a sharp increase in activity that immediately
followed. The observed delay, or the time between the onset of a stimulus and the beginning of a
signal, was referred to as the latency period. For both the on- and off-response, the latency period
ranged between 20 and 100 ms. The signals themselves, however, had durations around 20 ms
for the on-response and 130 ms for the off-response. Thus, although the on- and off-responses
were generated at similar times after a light stimulus, they persisted to different extents and at
varying magnitudes.
