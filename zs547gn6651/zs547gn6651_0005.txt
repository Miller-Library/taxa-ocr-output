and surrounding muscle tissue (Fig. 3). The eye was submerged in aerated 75% Hanks in a glass¬
holding dish during experimentation.
For tectal experiments, the skull was removed dorsally with forceps to expose the optic
tectum (Fig. 4). Äfter surgery, the fish was positioned upright in a glass-holding dish, and the
gills were perfused with aerated 75% Hanks solution. The solution level was maintained below
the gills. Adequate oxygen delivery was monitored throughout the experiment by observing the
blood flow in the gills and in the vessels on the optic tectum.
The glass-holding dish was placed in a light-isolated Faraday cage for both retinal and tectal
experiments.
Electrode Placement
Differential glass suction electrodes were used for recording from the retina and the tectum.
The electrodes consisted of an Ag-AgCl wire encased in a glass pipette filled with 75% Hanks
solution. The tectum electrode was positioned on the surface of either the right or the left tectal
hemisphere. The retinal electrode was placed on the stump of the detached optic nerve. Suction
and a mineral oil coating were used to establish a tight seal. A reference electrode was placed
approximately 2 cm from the fish. Once the electrodes were positioned, 30 minutes were given
for darkness adaptation.
Light Stimuli and Recordings
On- and off-light stimuli were produced by a white light-emitting diode (LED) positioned
approximately 3 cm to the left of the subject. The intensity of the LED was constant during all
periods of irradiance, and ambient light was minimal during dark periods. The flash duration and
interstimulus interval were controlled remotely by a computer (National Instruments Lab VIEW).
