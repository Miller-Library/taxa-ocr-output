predation by crabs and otters. An attempt was made to deter¬
mine if a higher proportion of abalone taken by sea otters
had boring damage but the sample was too small to yield con¬
clusive results.
There is a difference in the susceptibility of the
different species of abalone to attack by the borers. The
black abalone which lives primarily intertidally and in the
shallow subtidal has an appreciably lower infection rate for
both Cliona and Penitella. This is perhaps mediated through
habitat difference. The shells are in general quite clean of
growth of algae or other invertebrates. There may be some
depth limitation of Penitella infection as the white abalone
which occupies the deepest waters has the lowest infection
rate of any of the subtidal species.
These two commensals differ in their specificity of host
selection. Cliona can be found associated with a wide variety
of calcareous substrates including shells of oysters, rock
scallops, barnacles, coralline algae and a variety of other
gastropods. Penitella conradi is only reported from abalone.
It would be interesting to see if the infection rate of
Penitella was significantly dropping in the areas where sea
otters forage and have reduced both the population size and
size distribution of abalone. This would require collection
of a large sample of abalone which was not possible.
Many large abalone are taken which do have massive shell
damage by borers and appear to do well in their habitat.
