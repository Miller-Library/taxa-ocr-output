was fixed. The force was applied horizontally until the strip
broke and the maximum value recorded.
Shells dated as far back as 3500 years by archaeologists
were also looked at. Abalone and fresh abalone shells with
and without commensals were maintained in aquaria with running
sea water. Every 3 days the shells were checked for the
activity of the borers.
RESULTS
Figures 1 and 2 present the collection sites of the 6
species of Haliotis along with the infection rates which
were determined for the two commensals. Cliona is most pre¬
valent in the red abalone with lowest infection in the black
and pink abalones. For Penitella the infection rate is
dramatically lower for the black and somewhat reduced for the
white and threaded abalones.
The tests for strength of the infected shells are pre¬
sented in Figures 3 through 9. Figure 4 shows a correlation
between the breaking force and the amount of surface area
bored by Cliona. High values of boring reduce the strength
of the shell by over 603. The results for Penitella show no
clear correlation between number of Penitella per shell and
breaking point. These are presented in Figure 5 and the graph
reveals the scatter is very wide throughout the range of
infection.
When the strips are tested for their breaking strength
we see a similar relationship as obtained in the whole shells
