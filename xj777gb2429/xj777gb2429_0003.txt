study on these commensals by Hansen (1970). The above methods
do not take into account the extent of shell damage. Cliona
can bore very deeply into a shell or it can bore only in the
prismatic layer; however, the appearance is equivalent on the
surface area. The Penitella can be large or small and their
pattern of distribution in the shell will affect the amount
of structural damage. Since the borers remove shell material
and the amount of damage is a function of the shell removed:
it was judged that a determination of shell density would be
a good criterion of harm done by these commensals. In the
study 25 Haliotis rufescens shells were cut into 2.5 um wide
strips perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis. The
volume of each strip was calculated by measuring as carefully
as possible the average width, length and thickness. The
weight was also recorded. The density was obtained by
dividing the weight by the volume. The density of an entire
shell was found by averaging the densities of all the strips,
Independent measurements on the same strips indicated an
error of less than + 38.
The first strength test (Fig. 3) estimated the breaking
point while increasing the force applied to a 1 cm rod
resting on the convex surface while the shell was resting
on a scale. The force at which the shell shattered was
recorded. Shells of approximately equal dimensions were used.
The second strength test (Fig. 6) recorded the force at which
individual stripsbroke, when a spring balance was attached
4 centimeters from one end of the strip, while the other end
