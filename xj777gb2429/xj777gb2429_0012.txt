First strength test with Penitella. A graph to show force
applied to shells versus the infection by Penitella conradi.

The pereent surface area bored by the Penitella conradi is
different for each shell. Haliotis rufescens is used in
this test, which is described in Figure 3.
Second strength experiment using a force onto a strip of an
abalone. Because of the error involved in the first test,
the strength of the shell was estimated in this test by
cutting the shell into five or six one inch strips - the
middle one being used for the experiment. The measurements
were at first taken in pounds per square inch but the con¬
version was made to grams per cm2. Some of the strips were
not exactly an inch wide so an adjustment also had to be
made. The sequence of drawings shows the different steps
required in the experiment.
Second strength test. A graph to show the correlation be¬
tween the force applied onto the strip of shell and the
estimated overall percent of infection by Cliona celata.
Haliotis rufescens is used in this test, which is described
in Figure 6.
