INTRODUCTION
For many years investigators have been studying the
mechanisms involved in the penetration of hard shells by
boring organisms (Hancock, 1848; Lindsay, 1912; Hunter, 1949;
Smith, 1969); however evaluating the shell damage done by the
commensal activity has had little work. The many species
of California abalones (Haliotidae) are bored principally
by two animals that live commensally on the shells: Clione
celata Grant, var californiana De Laubenfels, 1932, a boring
sponge (Porifera); and Penitella conradi Valenciennes, 1846,
a boring clam. Cliona celata californiana bores a spreading
network of tunnels in its host's shell as it grows (MacGinitie
and MacGinitie, 1949). The boring piddock, Penitella conradi,
belongs to a group of rock and shell borers of the family
Pholadidae and chemically excavates a burrow which it enlarges
as it grows (Jaccarini, Bannister and Micallef, 1968). This
paper reports on investigations on geographic distribution of
the commensals, the structural damage to host shells, some
aspects of the relationship over historical time, and some
other observations on the biology of this infection. The
main question revolves around the strength of the shell when
infected and the loss of protection against predators. It
is known that sea otters use rocks to break the abalone shell
(Kenyon, 1959) and crabs prey upon the abalone by breaking
off the sides of the shell (Lox, 1962). It was found in this
study that the shell is definitely weaker if it is infected.
