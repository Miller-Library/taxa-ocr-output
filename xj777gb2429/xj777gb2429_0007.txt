These are in general from outside the range of the sea otter.
Their principal predator which would have to breech the
defense would be large crabs. Since the shell is laid down
at the margins this would provide new strong shell where the
crab would focus its attack.
The activity of boring commensals has been demonstrated
to greatly weaken the shell of abalone. It is still difficult
to quantify what impact this has on abalone survival in
natural situations.
SUMMARY
1. There are direct positive correlations between infection
by shell borers, shell density and the breaking point of
abalone shells.
2. Cliona celata bores into all species studied with the
greatest infection in H. rufesens and the least in H.
cracherodii.
3. Penitella conradi has lowest infection rates in H.
cracherodii and highest rates in H. rufesens, H. fulgens and
H. corrugata.
4. Penitella and Cliona have distinct boring patterns
and damage the shell in different ways.
