MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field and Study Sites
Collection of the many different species of abalones was
from the entire coast of California (fig. 1). A total of 257
shells of Haliotis rufescens, 65 of H. cracherodii, 64 of H.
corrugata, 15 of H. assimilis, 51 of H. sorenseni, and 75 of
H. fulgens were used in the study. As the map indicates the
geographical distribution covered abalones found as far north
as Point Saint George (Latitude 42째, Longitude 124째) and as
far south as the Islas Coronados (Latitute 32째, Longitude
117째). Shells used in the lab experiments were measured for
height (dorso-ventral axis) and maximum length. However only
the amount of infection and the lengths were measured for the
shells not used in the lab studies.
Lab Studies
Many methods were used to find the approixmate amount of
infection of Cliona celata and Penitella conradi to the abalone
shells. When looking strictly at the surface area of the
shell, detection of Penitella was reserved to counting holes
on the outside and the blister pearls on the inside. To
increase accuracy in many cases the shell was cleaned off of
any plant material and sanded in order to show the tip of the
Penitella. For Cliona,shell infection was quantified by
placing a l cm" grid over the surface area and counting the
infected and uninfected squares over the entire surface to
compute the percentage. These were the methods used in a
