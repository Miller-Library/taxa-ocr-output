The Hemal System
Introduction
While holothurians are widespread in all seas and
at all depths, our knowledge of their ecology and
biology is rather incomplete. (Pawson, 1966 as
stated by Filimonova, 1980.) The hemal system of
some echinoderms has been compared to the circula¬
tory system of higher vertebrates. (Burton, 1964.)
But in no echinoderm is the comparison more apt than
in the holothuroid P. californicus. The structure
and function of the holothurian hemal system has been
studied both histologically (Fish, 1967) and histo¬
chemically. The hemal system of this animal beats
with a distinctive rhythm, has an associated capil¬
lary system, and a close relationship to the digestive
tract. However, the function of these clear vessels
is virtually unknown and not well investigated. This
work proposes a structure for the fine connection
between the hemal vessels and the intestine, shows
that there is passage of some small molecules from the
intestine to the hemal fluid, and describes the
beating of the dorsal hemal vessels.
