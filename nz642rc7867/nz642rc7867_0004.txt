Vandeweghe
The Hemal System
Techniques
Some of the experiments were done on animals
with empty guts, accomplished by starving the animals
for about thirty hours. Before incisions were made,
the cucumber was relaxed in magnesium chloride (739/1,
lal seawater) for about fifteen to thirty minutes,
until the body wall no longer contracted when handled.
The animals were cut longitudinally on the ven¬
tral side. Pinning out the body wall exposed the
intestines clearly. The animals would remain alive
in this state for at least twenty-four hours if kept
in running seawater most of the time. It was found
to be important to have the animal alive with the
hemal system pumping strongly.
The initial experiments entailed injecting a
fluorescent dye, carboxy fluorescein, into the intes¬
tine and later the hemal vessels. The dye was injected
with a 33-gauge needle at different points along these
organs. A hand-held fluorescent lamp was held over
the animal, making the location of the dye visible.
The clear, thin membranes of these organs made it
possible to see the fluprescence as it flowed within
these organs.
