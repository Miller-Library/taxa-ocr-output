The Hemal System
FIGURES, Cont
Fig 5. A diagram of the proposed structure of the
hemal system with the intestine removed for
clarity. The dorsal connections appear to biÂ¬
furcate after entering the intestine. The hemal
fluid then flows within the folds circulating
the intestine. At the ventral side the lumen
of the folds lead into an intricate network of
tiny tubules that have connections to the ventral
hemal vessel.
