The Hemal System
Vandeweghe
1. Fast thrust anteriorly and towards intestine
at the time of contraction,
2. Brief pause,
3. Quick back-wash at the time of vessel relax-
ation, posteriorly and away from intestine,
4. About five seconds of no movement,
5. Slow anterior flow for about five seconds,
slowing to a stop until the next contraction.
In the ventral vessel the flow is more erratic,
depending on the peristaltic movements of the intes¬
tine, but net movement seems to be posteriorly. The
ventral vessel doesn't contract naturally, but with
physical stimulation it will contract at the site of
the stimulation. Physical stimulation also causes the
dorsal vessel to contract. But in this case, the con¬
traction spreads as waves in both directions from the
point of stimulation. The vessel has a latent period
of at least seven seconds before it will contract
again.
