The Hemal System
Absorption:
The structure of the hemal system certainly
indicates a possible role as a nutrient transporter.
(Fish, 1967; Filimonova and I. V. Tokin, 1980.) To
examine this, a fluorescent dye, carboxy fluorescein,
was injected into the intestine at different points.
In a full gut, the dye is seen in the hemal vessels
after about fifteen minutes, and after about thirty
minutes in an empty gut. Transport is not seen above
the constriction point, nor opposite the rete mirable
in any measurable quantities. (The orange material
could have made it difficult to see.) Thus, there
is a way for molecules to pass from the lumen of the
intestine into both the dorsal and ventral hemal
vessels.
If the dye is injected into either of the main
hemal vessels, it diffuses quickly along the vessel
and the gut appears striated with fluorescence, as
was seen with the cobalt and latex. This was thought
to represent the dye in the folds. Samples of intesÂ¬
tinal fluid were taken at intervals, and after two
hours, no sign of fluorescence was seen in the lumen.
