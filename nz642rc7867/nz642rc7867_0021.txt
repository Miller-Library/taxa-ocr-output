The Hemal System
FIGURES
Fig 1. A diagram of the intestine, shaped as it is
in the opened animal. A full description is given
in the text. The two numbered arrows indicate
the areas where beating begins (1) and ends (2).
Fig 2. These two photographs show the considerable
reduction of the dorsal hemal vessel when it
contracts. (Arrows)
Fig 3. This is a piece of intestine that has part of
it cut and layed open flat. The folds can clearly
be seen along the cut edge (a magnified picture
of this appears in Figure 4.) Notice how the
folds taper out into a flat network of capillaries
near the ventral hemal vessel.
Fig 4. A sketch taken from a slide of one of the
sections from the plastic embedding. It is a
side-on view of the edge of the intestine cut
lengthwise, showing the hollowness of the folds.
Hemal fluid flows into and out of the paper,
through these folds.
