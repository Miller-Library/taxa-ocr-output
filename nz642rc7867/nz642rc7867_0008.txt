The Hemal System
Vandeweghe
Beating and Hemal Flow
A number of investigators have reported a contrac¬
tile nature for parts of the hemal system. (Kawamoto,
1927; Prosser and Judson, 1952; see also Hyman, 1955.)
The dorsal vessel and its small connections beat
rhythmically every eighteen to twenty seconds. (Pros¬
ser and Judsen, in 1952, wrote that the vessels beat
four to five-point-four times per minute.) The con¬
traction moves along the dorsal vessel like a wave,
beginning just posterior to where the rete tapers off,
moving anteriorly and fading out just below the con¬
striction point. The dorsal connections are also seen
to beat with the waves, moving from the main dorsal
vessel towards the intestine. The capillaries of
the rete are not seen to beat, but the hemal fluid
does flow within them. (Figure 2A and 2B.)
Under a compound scope focused on a point along
the dorsal vessel, the flow pattern of the hemal fluid
can be detected by watching small particles that are
suspended in the fluid. The beating creates a mixing
of the hemal fluid with a general flow anteriorly and
towards the intestine. In the dorsal vessel, the
fluid movement is as follows:
