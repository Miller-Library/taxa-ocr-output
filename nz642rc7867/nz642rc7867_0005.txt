The Hemal System
Cobalt experiments were done by injecting (with
a hypodermic and a 33-gauge needle) a two molar co¬
baltous-chloride solution in seawater into the hemal
system, waiting a few seconds, rinsing with running
seawater for ten or twenty seconds, then topically
applying straight ammonium sulfide (light, Baker's
analyed.) This created a black precipitate wherever
the cobalt solution had flowed in the hemal system.
For the microtome sections, an FD-3 plastic em¬
bedding kit (Poly Sciences) was used after the tissue
was fixed. Fixation was done as follows:
1. Cut intestine into small pieces (1 inch)
2. Perfuse for 2 hours in fixative solution of:
1% gluteraldehyde
1% formaldehyde
85% seawater
5Omm HEPES solution
3. Rinse two times in distilled water.
4. Dehydrate in alcohol series.
The latex experiments were done by injecting
approximately 5 cc of the blue solution (latex in¬
jection medium, Caroline Biological Supply) into the
hemal vessels using 27-gauge neddle on a hypodermic.
After thirty minutes, the latex became sufficiently
hard so that dissecting could be done.
