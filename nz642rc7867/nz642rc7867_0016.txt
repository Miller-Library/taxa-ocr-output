The Hemal System
For future studies with absorption, the use of
materials that are more sensitive to measurement would
be useful. With the dye, a certain concentration had
to be reached before it was detectable, which could
have given some erroneous results. Also, the use of
more natural substrates (such as sugars or fats) would
be more relevant, in that it would be something the
animals would normally ingest and need for energy.
Past investigators have suggested that transport
across the gut is directly into the coilom and is ac¬
complished by active transport (D'Agostine and Farman¬
furmaian, 1960; Kawaguti, 1964) and have concluded that
the hemal sinuses are not significantly involved in
nutrient transport in either echinoids or hologhurians.
(Farmanfurmaian, 1963) G. F. Filimonova and I. B. Tokin
(1980) mention "The Coelomocyte Theory" (first introduced
by Enriques, 1902) where transport of enzymes and digested
material is by amoebocytes in the hemal fluid. The work
reported in this paper shows that some small molecules,
such as caboxyfluorescein, can be transferred from intes¬
tine to the hemal system. To ascertain whether nutrients
