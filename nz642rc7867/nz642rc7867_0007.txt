Vendeweghe
The Hemal System
The dorsal vessel lies some distance from the
intestine, attached to it by small dorsal connections
which also carry hemal fluid. These connections
begin at the constriction point, and get longer as
they move posteriorly along the intestine and are
sometimes seen to bifurcate after leaving the main
dorsal vessels. At the first bend of the intestine,
the connections become very thin and dense, beginning
what is known as the rete mirable. (Hyman, 1955;
Stutt, 1957.) To the naked eye, this looks like an
orange mass, but under a dissecting scope they appear
as fine capillaries filled with an orange material.
They intertwine among each other and the respiratory
tree, but do not open into the respiratory tree.
(Prosser and Judsen, 1952.)
Approaching the second bend, the rete begins to
concentrate back into the small dorsal connections,
with the bright orange fading out. About midway down
the large intestine, the main dorsal vessel moves
closer to the intestine, soon to blend into it.
