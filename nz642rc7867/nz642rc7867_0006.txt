The Hemal System
Results
In preliminary dissections, the gross structure
of the internal anatomy was studied with emphasis
on the hemal system and the intestine. The digestive
tract runs the length of the animal three times, as
seen in Figure 1. It is held in place by a mesentery
that attaches the dorsal side of the intestine to the
body wall.
The two main hemal vessels, the dorsal and ven-
tral, appear as clear vessels that run the length of
the intestine. Both are present along the intestine
as it exits the calcarous ring of the mouth. They
are said to originate from the hemal ring which lies
beneath the water vascular ring (Hyman, 1955.) Their
ending is obscure but they seem to fade into the in¬
testine about seven centimeters above the anus.
The ventral vessel lies very close to the in¬
testine along the entire length, and has a transverse
connection running from the bottom third of the de¬
scending part of the intestine to the middle position
of the ascending part of the intestine. This vessel
has the largest diameter of all hemal vessels seen.
