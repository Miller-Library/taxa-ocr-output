The Hemal System
Vandeweghe
The folds can be scraped from the outer epithelium
with ease at the dorsal side, and with a little more
difficulty near the ventral side. At the dorsal side
the folds seemed to be attached at a number of discrete
points, whereas at the ventral side the attachment
seemed continuous. Figure 3 is a drawing from a slide
of a microtome section, which revealed that there is
connective tissue which is responsible for holding the
folds to the outer epithelium.
Could these folds carry the hemal fluid? To
investigate this, two techniques were used: cobalt
precipitation and latex injection. With both of
these techniques, the gut appeared striated from the
outside. When the intestine was cut open, the black
cobalt and blue latex revealed where the hemal fluid
flowed.
It was found that hemal fluid flows within these
folds, thus creating the striated appearance from
the outside. When it came to the ventral area, the
interpretation was more difficult, though it appeared
that the lumen of the folds led into an intricate net¬
work of tiny tubules that lay close to the outer epi¬
thelium. This complex system is schematically pieced
together in Figure 5.
