The Hemal System
Vandeweghe
A single fold is not uniform around the lumen of
the intestine. At the dorsal side, there is a small
groove opposite where the dorsal connections enter
the intestine. Along the sides, the folds are large
and prominent, but they taper down near the ventral
side to tiny, irregular folds, giving a ruffly appear-
ance. This network of tiny ridges is about four
centimeters wide, with the ventral hemal vessel lieing
down the center on the outside of the intestine. It
was also noticed that on one side of the intestine,
the folds are larger, but no functional difference was
seen.
Along the length of the intestine, the folds are
not constant, either. They are absent above the con¬
striction point, and begin just after it. Opposite
the rete mirable, the large folds are not present,
although the intestinal lining appears superficially
to be ruffled all the way around, very much like what
was just described for the ventral part of the intes¬
tine. The folds are distinct where the dorsal con¬
nections are fairly long. The folds are of various
sizes and follow the general pattern of small, large,
small, medium, although there were fluctuations in
that; never were two small or two large folds seen
to be adjacent. (Figure 4.)
