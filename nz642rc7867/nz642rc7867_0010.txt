The Hemal System
Fine Anatomy:
Watching the flow of the hemal fluid where the
dorsal connections enter the intestine, it can be seen
that the vessels bifurcate beneath the outer epithelium
of the intestine, but where they go from there was the
next question. In previous papers on other holothurÂ¬
oids, authors have described a layer of the intestinal
wall beneath the muscle layer called the "tissue-fluid
complex." (Fish, 1967) The fluid in this layer is
said to be continuous with the hemal fluid. Yet, how
the connection is made was never described, so it seemed
to deserve some attention.
In p. californicus, this layer was not seen, but
rather, an interesting system of folds face the lumen
of the intestine. Under a good dissecting scope, the
digestive tract seems to be comprised of two layers:
a smooth outer epithelium and the inner layer, which
is convoluted into ridges or folds projecting into
the lumen of the intestine. (Figure 3.) These folds
are not solid masses, but have a cavity within them.
(Figure 4.) The best analogy is that of an accordion,
with pleats, or ridges, circling the intestine,
