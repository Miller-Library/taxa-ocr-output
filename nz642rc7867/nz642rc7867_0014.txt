The Hemal System
The gut never took on the appearance of solid
fluorescence either, so it appears as though trans¬
port from hemal to intestine is under different regula¬
tion.
When injected opposite the rete in the main dor-
sal vessel, fluorescence is seen to travel along the
vessel and partly into the tiny capillaries, only if
the vessel is beating strongly. But still, the in-
testine opposite the rete does not become fluorescent
in any way. Either there is a filtering system, or
the dye is moving through in quantities too small to
see.
A large fluorescent protein (75,000 MW, FITC dex¬
tran) was used to see if there is a size limit to
what is transported. When injected into the intes¬
tine, it moved along the gut as the other dye did,
yet after at least two hours, was not seen in any of
the hemal vessels. This indicates that the digestive¬
hemal association allows the transport of substances
smaller than 75,000 MW.
