The Hemal Syste
Abstract
The hemal system and its association with the
intestine was investigated in P. californicus. Two
main vessels run along the length of the intestine;
the dorsal hemal vessel is attached to the intestine
by small dorsal connections and the ventral vessel
lies nearly on top of the intestine. The dorsal
vessel beats about every eighteen to twenty seconds,
creating a flow pattern of the hemal fluid. The
association of the hemal fluid with the intestine was
determined by the use of cobalt and latex injections.
It was concluded that the hemal fluid flows through
concentric folds that face the lumen of the intestine.
The transport or absorbtion of small molecules from
the lumen of the intestine into the hemal vessels
occurs within a fairly short time-fifteen minutes--
but the passage of larger molecules is blocked.
