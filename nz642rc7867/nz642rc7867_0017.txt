The Hemal System
can be transferred, further examination of the types
of molecules that pass across the intestinal-hemal
barrier would be necessary. (Radio isotopes of difÂ¬
ferent substrates would be useful.) Also, does the
hemal system have vessels that flow along the body
wall? These areas should be investigated to determine
if this system carries nutrients to the body wall of
the P. californicus.
