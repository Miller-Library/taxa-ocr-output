The Hemal System
Vandeweghe
Discussion
A detailed physiological description of the
intestine and the hemal vessels was given. The
hemal fluid is propelled, as described, through
the large vessels and compartments within the men¬
branes of the intestine. This close association
allows the transfer of small molecules from the lumen
of the intestine to the hemal vessels. (Oomen, 1926;
Schreiber, 1932, as reported by Fish, 1952.) Sub¬
stances of small molecular weight (carboxy fluorescien)
were seen to transfer from the lumen of the intestine
to the hemal vessels. The hemal fluid is propelled
through the large vessels and compartments within the
membranes of the intestine. The beating of the dor¬
sal vessel produces a mixing motion with slow move¬
ment anteriorly and across the intestine to the
ventral vessel. The beating was found to be important
for moving hemal fluid into the smaller vessels such as
the dorsal connection and rete capillaries. The pro¬
posed anatomical connection is complex, but its descrip¬
tion will be of great value to further studies in this
area.
