especially given the apparently high safety factors exhibited by individual
fronds of E. menziesi
The forces required to break E. menziesii plants' stipes were found to be
correlated to the plants' areas in the exposed sites but not in the sheltered
sites. This could be explained two ways. First, the more exposed plants could
have already been "pruned" by the waves hitting them. Weaker sections of
plant would have broken off so that only the stronger sections remained to be
tested. In this scenario, selection for stronger branches of stipe would not
have occurred in the more sheltered plants where wave forces were less
strong. If this explanation were correct, one would expect to find a greater
proportion of broken branches in exposed than in sheltered plants. Such a
pattern was not observed.
The second possible explanation is that the plant's morphology
responds to the demands of its environment during ontogeny. Sheltered
plants would not experience forces as strong as those imposed on exposed
plants, and in response, their stipes would not develop to as great an extent.
Exposed plants would experience large forces, so they would develop larger,
broader stipes in response. There is much evidence that algae do indeed
adapt their morphology to environmental conditions. Laminaria longicruris
are observed to have strap-like blades on exposed coasts and broader blades on
sheltered coasts (Gerard and Mann 1979) Nereocystis luetkeana blades are
narrower and flatter at exposed sites than at sheltered sites (Koehl and Alberte
1988), and reciprocal transplant experiments by Koehl and Alberte (1988)
showed that when narrow, flat-bladed plants from exposed sites were
transplanted to sheltered sites the blades became wider and more undulate.
The plants that were transplanted from sheltered areas to exposed areas did
not survive. Gerard (1987) grew Laminaria saccharina under different stress
