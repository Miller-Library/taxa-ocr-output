closest to the ceiling have the most force on them because they support the
weight of the whole chain. Those at the end, however, only support the
weight of the few links beyond them. If the drag forces on a plant were
analogous to weight on a chain, then the stipe area near the end of the plant
could be smaller and still maintain the same chance of breaking, and thus the
plant might show tapering along its length.
The fact that the stipes of actual E. menziesii do not exhibit such
tapering can possibly be explained by the predictions made by the model for
the forces on various size plants subjected to waves of constant height. Figure
13 shows that the maximum forces from a 1.5 m wave on negatively buoyant
plants of a range of sizes can be found at almost any point on their stipes. In
addition, Figure 9 shows how the location of the maximum force on a 1.36 m
plant moves along its stipe as wave heights vary. This is because, as an E.
menziesii plant moves in a wave, the plant curls up on itself. The motion of
the wave then unfolds this loop, and the unfolding results in a whiplike
motion. The portion of the plant that is "whip-cracked" experiences forces
that are often some of the largest forces resulting from the wave. Because the
position of the whip-cracking forces changes with length of plant and strength
of wave, the stipe must be strong all along its length.
This whip-cracking is seen to a lesser extent in positively buoyant
plants. As Figures 10 and 14 indicate, the largest tensions in positively
buoyant plants' stipes tend to be at their bases. The explanation given above
for the uniform stipe areas in E. menziesii therefore does not apply to
positively buoyant plants. Positively buoyant plants in the intertidal region
are rare, however, so it is possible that the species has developed to
accommodate negatively buoyancy.
