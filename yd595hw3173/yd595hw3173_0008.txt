proximal and distal to the node (see Figure 3). Lift is deemed to be negligible
in algae such as E. menziesii (Gaylord et al. 1990, in press) The forces at each
node are those that would be felt by the section of the frond which that point
represents. Treating the forces as vectors, the acceleration of each point is
determined. The basic equation by which the model operates is:
Ed+Ea+B+T=M(duo/dt)
(eq. 6)
where uo is the velocity of the point relative to the stationary substratum and
where all the forces are vectors. This equation is solved simultaneously for
all nodes using a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm and time steps of .0025
seconds. See Utter and Denny (in preparation) for further details.
A plant with average size and strength was selected and used to
determine the physical parameters for the model. The plant's terminal
lamina and rachis (see Figure 1) were separated, and each was used to describe
the corresponding section of the plant in the model. First, the rachis was
divided into sections of equal length. This length, L = 0.14 m, was the length
of the symbolic rope between the nodes of the rachis in the model. The
sections were then weighed, and the mean mass was used for M. The area of
a section was calculated by tracing as before, and used in calculations of Eq and
Ea. The drag coefficient that was also needed for calculations of Eq was
obtained by towing an E. menziesii plant behind a boat and measuring the
drag at different velocities (see Figure 4). The cross sectional area of the stipe
was measured with vernier callipers as before, and the resulting value was
used for the cross section of the rope. The same sequence of measurements
was made on the terminal lamina, which was divided into two sections of L =
0.12 m. These new values were given to the last two nodes in the model. A
value for the tensile strength was obtained from tests done by Buchanan
