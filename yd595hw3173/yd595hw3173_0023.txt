Figure 1. Egregia menziesii, the species used in this study.
Figure 2. Area of E. menziesii increases with mass, according to relationship
in eq. 3. R2 = 0.959 for correlation between area predicted by eq. 3 and
actual area measured.
Figure 3. Representation of E. menziesii frond in hydro-mechanical model.
Each frond section is modeled as a point mass (node) acted upon by
vector forces. The point masses, which occur at the nodes, are
connected by a flexible, extensible "rope" that simulates the stipe.
Figure 4. Measurements of the drag force were taken from an E. menzie
plant which was towed behind a boat. Water velocities are relative to
the plant.
Figure 5. Force required to break stipe is correlated to frond area in plants at
posed sites (eq. 7) but not in plants at protected sites.
Figure 6. The frond area per stipe cross-sectional area (q) varies with exposure
index (s) by correlation equation: qu = 1419.623 + 307.377 (s).
Figure 7. Weibull functions for probability of breaking can be used with
estimates of forces from waves to predict a plant's survivorship.
Figure 8. Maximum tension at any node and average tension on all nodes of
a negatively buoyant,1.36 m plant increase with increasing wave height
(in water 1.5 m deep).
