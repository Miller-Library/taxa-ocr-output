conditions, hanging weights from the ends of some plants and not others.
The plants with weights to simulate drag developed narrow blades
(characteristic of exposed plants), and the others developed wide blades
(characteristic of protected plants).
Conclusions
Intact E. menziesii plants are strong enough to survive the forces of
the largest expected waves, although their chances of breaking increase
substantially if their stipes are preyed upon or are twisted around each other.
Although individual plants are often large enough to "go with the flow,
model simulations suggest that E. menziesii does not employ this
mechanism of avoiding drag. Instead, E. menziesii minimizes the force on its
large fronds by streamlining its shape to reduce its drag coefficient.
