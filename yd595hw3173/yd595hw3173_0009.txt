(1987, unpublished data). A small value for compressive stiffness was
estimated, so as to create reasonable behavior in the model.
Two values for buoyancy were used in the model. Most of the
intertidal plants observed in the field had a negative buoyancy, and six of
these were collected. A 0.14 m section was removed from each rachis. These
segments were weighed to the nearest 0.01 g, and their volume was
determined to the nearest 0.2 ml by water displacement. Their densities were
calculated from these measurements, and their buoyancies in sea water were
determined. The mean buoyancy, which was -0.02 N/node, was used in one
set of model runs.
A few plants were observed to be positively buoyant. To obtain an
estimate of the maximum buoyancy of intertidal plants, a plant with an
unusually high concentration of pneumatocysts was chosen, and its buoyancy
was calculated as described above. The value which resulted, 0.03 N/node,
was used in another set of model runs.
The buoyancies of the terminal laminas of all these plants were also
determined. They ranged from -0.015 to -0.025, and consequently the terminal
laminas in all the model runs were given a buoyancy of -0.02.
The model was first used to predict the forces due to a range of wave
heights on two standardized plants of identical dimensions: one plant was
negatively buoyant, the other positively buoyant. The two plants were placed
in simulated water 1.5 meters deep, which was judged to be a typical depth for
E. menziesii at high tide. The plants were then subjected to waves increasing
in height from .75 meters to 2.5 meters (approximately the maximum size
waves can become before breaking in water of this depth, Denny 1988) at .25
meter increments. The model was run for one wave period to allow
