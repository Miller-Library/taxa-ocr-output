A surprising result of the computer modeling is shown in Figure 12.
According to descriptions of large algae "going with the flow" and avoiding
drag (Koehl 1986), one would expect that the longer E. menziesii become, the
smaller the fraction of time plant will actually be stretched out in a wave, and
the later that time will be in the wave cycle. Because the water velocity from
waves follows a sinusoidal pattern, if a plant does not feel drag until later in
the wave cycle, the drag that the plant does feel will be smaller because the
velocity of the water will have decreased. As Figure 12 indicates, however.
this does not seem to occur. Up to the size plant which the model could
accommodate, the maximum forces predicted increased with plant size.
Although the model needs to be improved so that larger plants can be
studied, E. menziesii does not seem to display the mechanism described for
other large algae of improving their ability to withstand hydrodynamic forces
by increasing in length (Koehl 1986). It is possible that the curling of fronds
(prior to "whip-cracking") typical of E. menziesii prevents the plant from
smoothly going with the flow.
Subtidal E. menziesii tend to be positively buoyant, but a majority of
the intertidal E. menziesii studied were negatively buoyant. The model raises
the question of why negative buoyancies are observed in E. menzies
populations at all, because it predicts that, under the conditions tested,
buoyancy reduces the forces on E. menziesii (compare Figures 6 and 9). The
answer could be that a negatively buoyant plant is able to clear the substratum
around it as it moves in the waves, pushing away any competitors for space
with the motion of its fronds. For example, Laminaria pallida employs such a
sweeping mechanism to clear circular patches around itself (Velmirov and
Griffiths 1979). The advantage of keeping away competitors could be greater
than the advantage buoyancy provides in reducing the forces felt by the stipe,
