The parameters for the Weibull functions for the probability of
breaking (eq. 5) were: a = 0.3049, b = 0.0124,c = 0.8387 for exposed plants, and a
= 0.4685, b = -0.0036, c = 0.7562 for protected plants (see Figure 7).
There was no significant correlation between level of exposure and the
fraction of broken stipe branches (Student's t-test p»».05).
Model Results
The average and maximal forces predicted to be imposed on the 1.36 m,
negatively buoyant plant increase with wave height (see Figure 8). For wave
heights less than 1.5 meters, the maximum force occurs near the free end of
the plants. As wave height increases, however, the maximum force occurs at
the basal node (see Figure 9).
The predictions for the 1.36 m, positively buoyant plant are more
regular: force at every node increases with wave height, and force along the
plant decreases with distance from the holdfast (see Figure 10). The average
and the maximum forces predicted for the positively buoyant plant are less
that those for the negatively buoyant plant (compare Figure 8 and Figure 11).
For a given waviness, forces on E. menziesii increase as the plant
increases in size (see Figure 12). However, in negatively buoyant plants of
different sizes, the maximum forces are not always at the base, and large
forces appear at the base, the middle, and at the end of the stipe (see Figure
13). In positively buoyant plants, forces tend to decrease along the stipe even
as the plants get longer (see Figure 14).
Survivorship Predictions
The probabilities of a stipe of an intact plant breaking from the
maximum wave forces predicted were uniformly low. For a 1.36 m plant in
1.5 m water with 2.25 m high waves, which is the largest waves would
become without breaking, the probability of a stipe failing was 3.85 x 10-7.
