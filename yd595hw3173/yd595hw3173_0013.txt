result indicates that E. menziesii may be designed so that they can survive
some level of predation and entanglement. If either of these factors becomes
too severe, however, the plant is in danger of being broken by a large wave.
E. menziesii's strength does not result from the material in its stipe
being stronger than that of other algae. E. menziesii's tensile strength is 1.2 X
107 (Buchanan, unpublished data), which is in the same range as other algae
(from 9.6 x 10Â° for Postelsia parmaeformis to 3.6 x107 for Iridaea flaccida,
Denny et al. 1989). E. menziesii's frond area per stipe cross-sectional area is
also in the same range as that measured for other algae. For example,
Carrington's (1990) measurements of Mastocarpus papillatus indicate that it
has a frond area per stipe area of about 2800. As Figure 6 demonstrates, E.
menziesii at exposed sites have frond areas per stipe areas averaging around
2000, and E. menziesii at sheltered sites have fond areas per stipe areas
averaging around 4000.
Some of the explanation for how E. menziesii attains its large size
could reside in its coefficient of drag, Cd (see eq. 1). In water velocities of 1.9
m/s, E. menziesii's coefficient of drag is 0.016 (from Figure 4 and eq. 1 with
measurements of the plant on which drag tests were done). In the same
conditions, M. papillatus's drag coefficient is 0.123 (Carrington 1990). This
means that, for a given area, E. menziesii experiences 7.7 times less drag than
M. papillatus. Thus, E. menziesii could be accommodating its large size by
streamlining its shape and thereby reducing its drag.
Another question that arises is why (unlike other algae) the stipes of E.
menziesii maintain the same cross sectional area throughout their length. If
drag forces added cumulatively along a plant, one would expect that the stipe
near the free end of the plant would experience less stress than the stipe at the
base. An analogy can be drawn to a chain hanging from a ceiling. The links
