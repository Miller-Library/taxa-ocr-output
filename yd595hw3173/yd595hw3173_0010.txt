equilibration, and the maximum force felt by each node during the
subsequent wave period was recorded.
The program was then used to model the forces imposed by 1.5 meter-
high waves in 1.5 meters of water on plants of increasing sizes. Plants of -0.02
and +0.03 buoyancy were "grown" from 0.66 meters length, adding 0.14
meters (one node) at a time. Again, the maximum force felt by each node
during a wave period was recorded.
A graphics program was used to check the results of the model. This
program maps the location of each node at each time, drawing the E.
menziesii as it is moved by a wave. The computer's descriptions of the
motions of both positively and negatively buoyant plants were compared to
actual plants' motion in waves as observed from the shore and while
snorkeling.
Results
Breaking Strength
An analysis of the data for stress required to break each stipe for a given
plant size indicates that the mean strengths of exposed and protected plants
are statistically distinct (Mann-Whitney U test, nj=40, n2-39, U=1141, p«.001).
The stress required to break the stipes of exposed plants were correlated to the
plants' areas by the equation:
F = 102.613 + 365.868 (A)0.8223
(eq. 7)
where F is the force (in N) and A is the area (in m2) (Student's t-test, df-39,
pe.02). There was no significant correlation, however, between sheltered
plants' area and breaking force. The mean breaking force for sheltered plants
was 92.4 N (see Figure 5). The frond area per stipe cross sectional area was
correlated to exposure, increasing as exposure decreased (Student's t-test,
p«.02) (see Figure 6).
