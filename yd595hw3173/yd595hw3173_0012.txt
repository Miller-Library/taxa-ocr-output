Discussion
Tests of the breaking strength of E. menziesii indicate that it is much
stronger than it needs to be to withstand the hydrodynamic forces it
experiences. For example, the model predicts that the largest force on an
standard plant of 1.36 meters in 1.5 meters of water with 2.5 meter waves will
be 14.02 N. The strength per area relationship (eq. 7), however, indicates that
this plant requires more than 145 N to break its stipe. This means that the
plant is at least 10 times stronger than it needs to be to withstand even the
strongest expected wave, as a result, its chances of breaking 1 in 2.6 million.
The question then becomes, not how could E. menziesii possibly be strong
enough to survive the forces on it, but why is it so much stronger than it
seemingly needs to be?
Observation of actual E. menziesii plants in the intertidal zone
indicates why this strength may be necessary. E. menziesii is often preyed
upon by the limpet Notoacmea insessa. It is not uncommon for these limpets
to eat half way through E. menziesii stipes, decreasing the forces that plants
can withstand by at least 1/2. E. menziesii fronds also often become tangled in
each other, which could place the forces from many fronds on one stipe.
Koehl and Wainwright (1977) described such tangling as being a major cause
of stipe breakage in Nereocystis luetkeana, and it is also common among
Macrocystis pyrifera (P. Dayton, personal communication to M. Denny).
If the forces on 4 E. menziesii fronds are projected onto one stipe
because they are entangled, and if that stipe has been half eaten by limpets,
that plant can withstand only 1/8 the force it normally could survive. This
reduces the estimated stress required to break the stipe to about 18 N.
Inserting a normalized force of 14/18 into equation 5 (with the coefficients
determined for exposed sites) yields a probability of breaking of 29.2%. This
