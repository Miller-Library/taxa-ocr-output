Figure 9. Tensions at nodes of a negatively buoyant, 1.36 m plant as wave
height increases in water of 1.5 m. At waves below 1.5 m in height, the
largest force is near the free end of the plant. In waves above 1.5 m, the
largest tension is at the base of the plant.
Figure 10. Tensions at nodes of a positively buoyant, 1.36 m plant as wave
height increases in water of 1.5 m. The largest tension is always at the
base of the plant.
Figure 11. Maximum tension at any node and average tension from all nodes
of a positively buoyant, 1.36 m plant in 1.5 m water increase as wave
height increases.
Figure 12. Maximum tension in positively and negatively buoyant plants
increases as they increase in length, which would not be predicted if the
plants were "going with the flow" to reduce drag.
Figure 13. Large tensions are predicted at points all along the stipes of
negatively buoyant plants, which could explain why the stipes
maintain the same cross-sectional area throughout their lengths.
Figure 14. Unlike negatively buoyant plants, positively buoyant plants
experience the most tension near at the base of their stipes.
