the largest water velocities (Koehl and Alberte 1988). Mastocarpus papillatus
reconfigures its branches in high water velocities to achieve a more
streamlined shape and thereby lowers its drag coefficient as flow increases
(Carrington 1990). Many other algae, such as Durvillea antarctiça, use
flexibility and extensibility, bending with the flow and then stretching
substantially before failing. Öthers, such as Lessonia nigrescens, are stiffer, so
they do not freely bend. Instead, they are stronger than many more flexible
algae, and this strength allows them to resist breakage (Koehl 1984).
Another technique for withstanding hydrodynamic forces has been
described in large algal species that grow subtidally, where water is calmer
than it is in the surf zone (Denny 1988, Gaylord et al. in press). If plants are
long enough, they can move with the water without ever becoming fully
extended and thereby avoid most of the potential drag (Koehl 1986). In
oscillating flow, a very long, flexible plant could reverse directions with the
water before ever using up the slack in its stipe (Koehl 1986). According to
this strategy of "going with the flow," bigger is better; the larger a plant is, the
less force it experiences.
Alternative scenarios are possible, however. Because drag increases
with an object's area, and the accelerational force increases with an object's
volume, it has been suggested that these forces could serve to limit the size of
wave swept plants (Gaylord et al. in press, Koehl 1986). According to this
explanation of how plants survive, smaller is better. Indeed, Gaylord, et al.
have shown that three species of algae, Gigartina leptorhynchos, Pelvetiopsis
limitata, and Iridaea flaccida, all have average sizes consistent with those that
would be predicted if drag and acceleration forces were limiting their size.
These plants are all less than 25 cm in length, so one might be led to believe
this is the ideal size for algae.
