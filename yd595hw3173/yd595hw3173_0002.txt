between the fluid upstream and downstream of the plant (Vogel 1981). Drag
acts in the direction of flow, and is described by the equation:
Ed -(1/2) CdpAc ur ur.
(eq. 1)
where Cd is the coefficient of drag, p is the density of the water (1025 kg/m2
for seawater), Ac is the area of the plant, and ur is the velocity of the water
relative to the plant (Gaylord et al. in press).
The accelerational force, Ea, is the name given to the forces that result
from both the plant's and the water's acceleration (Denny 1988, Koehl 1986). It
is a combination of the force required to accelerate the mass of the plant itself,
and the forces which result from the acceleration of the water surrounding
the plant. Like drag, the acceleration reaction force acts parallel to the
direction of flow, and is given by:
Ea = M(du/dt) +pVCa(d(ur)/dt) +pY (du/dt),
(eq. 2)
where Mis the mass of the plant, uo is the velocity of the plant relative to the
stationary subtratum, u is the velocity of the water relative to the substratum,
p is again the density of the water, V is the volume of water displaced by the
object, and Ca is the added mass coefficient which indicates how much water
or "added mass" is accelerated with the plant (Gaylord et al. in press).
Several mechanisms by which some algae avoid being broken or
dislodged by these hydrodynamic forces have been studied. Gigartina
exasperata, for example, reportedly takes advantage of the boundary layer next
to the substratum in which water velocities are lower than in the mainstream
flow. By being flexible and lying near the substratum, this species exposes
only its upper surface to high flow velocities and reduces the amount of skin
friction drag that it experiences (Koehl 1984). Nereocystis luetkeana forms a
bundle of its blades, which reduces drag because of the bundle's streamlined
shape and because the blades on the inside of the bundle are shielded from
