Materials and Methods
Determining Breaking Strengths of E. menziesii
E. menziesii plants were selected haphazardly along the coast of Pacific
Grove, CA, to be tested for the forces required to break their stipes. If there
was visible evidence that a plant's stipe had been preyed upon, that
individual was not used. Each E. menziesii plant that was tested was first
given an exposure index based on its location. These ratings varied from one
to ten, where one was the most exposed and ten the most sheltered. The
ratings were determined by observing how many objects there were seaward
of the plant that would cause waves to break at the mid-tide level. Starting
with index = 1 indicating completely exposed, a point was added for each of
these wave barriers. For example, if there were three rock formations that the
waves passed before reaching a plant, then the plant was given an exposure
index of 4.
The breaking strength of each E. menziesii plant was then measured
with a spring scale. The scale was calibrated with standard weights before use
and was rechecked periodically throughout the study. A rope was attached to
the spring scale and then knotted around a plant's stipe 5-10 centimeters
above the holdfast. The scale was then pulled parallel to the substratum (to
simulate drag) until the stipe broke, and the maximum force registered by the
scale was recorded to the nearest 1.5 N. If the holdfast of the plant came off
the rock instead of the stipe breaking, the measurements for that plant were
not used.
The broken plants were taken back to the lab in sealed plastic bags.
There, the length and width of each broken stipe was measured within .05
