Acknowledgments
I owe countless thanks to Mark Denny for all his help with this
research. He has been incredibly generous with his time and knowledge and
has guided me through every step of the project.
Molly Cummings, Sandy Friedland, and Tom Friedland also provided
vital assistance by joining me in pulling on Egregia plants. I could not have
faced all the 6:00 am low tides without them.
I would also like to thank Brian Gaylord for his work on the hydro-
mechanical model and for his patience with my questions throughout the
quarter.
Lastly, I would like to thank Kim Hoke and Ravi Chandrasekaran for
being wonderful housemates, cooking great food, and making this quarter
fun.
