a plant having less than a given normalized force were found by the
equation:
p =i/(N+1),
(eq. 4)
where i was the rank of the plant. A modified Weibull function of the form:
p = exp Ia-bfn)/(a-bc)) 1/b
(eq. 5)
was then fit to these probabilities. The resulting equations were used to make
predictions of how likely it would be for a given force to break a plant of a
given area in each of the exposure categories (Denny and Gaines 1990).
While testing stipe strengths in the field, it was noted that many plants
already had broken branches. The remains of these former branches
resembled the stumps of stipe that were left after I pulled on them. To test
how many fronds were broken naturally, fifty plants (selected haphazardly)
from a range of exposures were examined. The major stipe branches on each
plant were counted, and then the fraction of these that were broken was
recorded.
Predicting Wave Forces on E. menziesi
A hydro-mechanical model (similar to that of Utter and Denny, in
preparation) was used to predict the stresses waves place on E. menziesii. The
model uses the shallow water approximations of linear wave theory to
describe water motion and treats a plant frond as a series of point masses
(nodes) connected by segments of extensible and flexible "rope" (see Figure 3).
Each node has a mass, M (equal to the mass of the frond segment which it
represents), and a buoyancy, B. The massless rope has the tensile strength,
compressive stiffnesses, and the cross sectional area of an E. menziesii stipe.
The force balance on each point mass, or node, is calculated as idealized
waves flow past the plant. The forces considered are those resulting from the
drag Eq, acceleration reaction Ea, buoyancy, B, and tension, T, of the stipe
