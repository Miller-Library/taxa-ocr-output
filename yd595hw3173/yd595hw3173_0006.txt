mm with vernier calipers, and the cross-sectional area of the break was
calculated as an ellipse of the same length and width. The breaking strength
(that is, the force which broke the stipe divided by the cross-sectional area of
the stipe) was calculated for each plant. Fronds were then weighed and traced
onto paper, and the traces were cut out and weighed. The area of each frond
was determined by dividing the mass of each paper trace by the value for the
mass per square meter of paper. Once 160 fronds had been measured, an
allometric equation was fitted to the relationship between area, A (in m2), and
mass, M (in kg), of the plants using a simplex algorithm on the
untransformed data and a least-squares criterion for the best fit (see Figure 2).
The resulting equation:
A =0.05968 M0.8922
(eq. 3)
was used to estimate a value for frond area based on the measurement of
mass for the rest of the plants sampled.
When examining the breaking data for trends in the strength and size
of the plants at different exposure sites, all plants with an exposure rating of 5
were rejected. This was done to insure that there was a clear difference
between sheltered plants (rating 6-10) and exposed plants (ratings 1-4).
Once the two exposure groups were distinguished, an allometric curve
of the form y = a + bxc was fit to the measurements of plant strength and area
for each group. The strength data were then normalized to this curve by
dividing the actual force which broke a plant's stipe by the predicted breaking
force obtained from the allometric equation (eq. 7). This gave a value for
normalized breaking force (fn) for each plant. The fn values were ranked in
ascending order from 1 to N, where N was the number of plants tested in the
exposure category being analyzed. Estimates of the cumulative probability of
