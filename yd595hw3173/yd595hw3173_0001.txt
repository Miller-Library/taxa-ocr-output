Abstract
Organisms on rocky intertidal shores must withstand water velocities
of 10 to 20 m/s (Denny 1988, Carrington 1989, Jones and Demetropoulos 1968)
and accompanying accelerations of 400 m/s2 (Denny et al. 1985, Gaylord et al.
in press). Because drag and accelerational forces increase with area and
volume respectively, the bigger a species is, the larger the forces on it become.
Egregia menziesii is an unusually large alga that lives in the intertidal region
amid violent water motion. Here, I address how E. menziesii interacts with
flow. A hydro-mechanical model is used to predict the magnitude of the
forces on E. menziesii in various wave conditions and for various plant sizes.
Based on measurements of the strength of E. menziesii, an intact, averageÂ¬
sized plant's survivorship in the range of predicted wave forces is found to be
nearly 100%. However, predation and entanglement with other plants can
lower an individual's chances of surviving a severe storm to nearly 70%. E.
Menziesii's straplike shape is found to be necessary for accommodating the
distribution of tensions along the plant's stipe and for reducing drag.
Introduction
Wave induced water velocities on rocky shores can reach 10 to 20 m/s
(Denny 1988, Carrington 1989), and the accompanying accelerations can exceed
400 m/s2 (Jones and Demetropoulos 1968, Denny et al. 1985, Gaylord et al. in
press). Intertidal species have had to develop a range of strategies to survive
the extreme hydrodynamic forces that result from this violent water motion.
There are four forces that act on algae in waves: drag, lift, buoyancy
and an accelerational force. (Denny 1988, Koehl and Wainwright 1977
Gaylord et al. in press, Utter in preparation) Of these, drag and accelerational
forces are usually the largest. Drag, Eq, is the result of a pressure difference
