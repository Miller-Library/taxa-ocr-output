At present, it is not clear whether all algae's survival mechanisms can
be explained by one of the scenarios described above. For example, on rocky
intertidal shores, adjacent to the algae reported to be size-limited, is E.
menziesii, a plant that can be more than an order of magnitude larger than its
neighbors. E. menziesii is a brown algae that grows from Alaska to Baja
California on intertidal shores and at depths up to 20 m (Abbot and
Hollenberg 1976). An E. menziesii plant typically has 4-25 branches that can
grow to be 5 to 15 m long (Abbot and Hollenberg 1976). These branches
consist of stipes that have uniform, elliptically-shaped cross-sectional areas
throughout most of their lengths. The stipes are lined with blades of 2 to 8
cm on either side and, in some cases, with pneumatocysts (see Figure 1).
Approximately 25 cm from the end of each branch, or frond, there is a 1-4 cm
section of stipe without blades. Distal to this section, the stipe is flatter and
thinner and the blades on it are smaller. This last portion of the frond is the
terminal lamina.
E. menziesii's unusual size raises questions as to how it functions in
shallow wave-swept environments. For example: Does E. menziesii does
avoid drag by "going with the flow," as has been described for large algae in
deeper water? If so, is there any limit to the frond size it can support? Is E.
menziesii made of stronger material than other intertidal algae, or does it
have less frond area per stipe area? How large are the hydrodynamic forces
on E. menziesii?
Here, I address how E. menziesii interacts with flow. A hydroÂ¬
mechanical model is used to predict the magnitude of the forces on E.
Menziesii in various wave conditions and for various plant sizes. These
forces are then compared to measurements of the strength of E. menziesii,
and predictions are made about the plant's survivorship. The hydrodynamic
