nucleotides 4624 to 4640. In Figure 1, the level of sensitivity of the PCR protocol
used in this experiment is assessed by the detection of pGFLNI in serial dilutions.
The most dilute sample which still displays a definite band corresponds to lane 9,
and this sample was calculated to contain 1110 copies of Na channel cDNA. Thus,
the same dilution of plasmid as that in lane 9 served as the positive control for
testing the presence of GFLNI mRNA at different embryonic stages.

PCR is specific enough to detect the targeted segment of GFLNI from a pool
of various cDNA coding for different proteins. In Figure 2, lane 1 contains the
amplified region of pGFLNI and provides a positive control. Lane 2, the negative
control, did not contain cDNA template in the PCR reaction, and no band is
present. This negative control is important because of the risk of contamination
and the sensitivity of PCR as proven above. Lane 3 represents amplified cDNA
made from RNA of adult squid stellate ganglion. The calculated size of the
amplified segment of GFLNI is 921 base pairs, which corresponds to the size of the
bands in lanes 1 and 3 measured by a 1 kilobase DNA ladder. Lane 4 contains
CDNA amplified from adult gill tissue and shows a very faint band at the position
of the gel expected for the GFLNI segment. Lane 5 contains no detectable band,
suggesting that GFLNI mRNA is not present at stage 23 of the squid embryo.
The presence/absence of GFLNI mRNA in each embryonic stage was
similarly tested, and the results are conveyed in Figure 3. Sodium channel mRNA
initially appears somewhere between embryonic stage 23 and 25, and expression
continues from this point until hatching at stage 30.
