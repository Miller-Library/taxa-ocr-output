Figure 1. Sensitivity of PCR for detecting pGFLNI. Each lane contains a serial
dilution of pGFLNI which was amplified by PCR. Lanes 1 and 8 each consist of a
one kilobase DNA ladder, while lanes 2-7 and 9-13 constitute the serial dilutions of
PGFLNI. Lane 2 was loaded with the most concentrated sample of pGFLNI and
corresponds to 1x102-2 ug or 1.11x109 molecules of pGFLNI. Each subsequent lane
contains a ten-fold dilution of pGFLNI. Lane 14 is the negative control. The band
measures 921 kb.
Figure 2. Specificity of PCR for detecting GFLNI CDNA. PCR was performed with
GFLNI CDNA made from RNA isolated from different squid tissues/stages. Lane 1,
the positive control, contains 1x100-8 ug of pGFLNI. The negative control was run
in lane 2 and contains no DNA template in the PCR mix. Lanes 3-5 each represent
3 ug of RNA extracted from adult stellate ganglion (SG), adult gill tissue, and stage
23 embryos (23), respectively. The molecular size of the amplified GFLNI segment
is 921 kb.
Figure 3. Detection of GFLNI CDNA by PCR from staged squid embryos. The
numbered lanes indicate the embryonic stage from which RNA was extracted. Each
lane represents 3 ug of RNA that was made into cDNA and amplified in PCR.
RNA from adult stellate ganglion (SG) and pGFLNI (PL) served as positive controls
for detection of GFLNI. The molecular weight of the amplified region of GFLNI is
921 kb.
Figure 4. RNAse Protection Assay with GFLNI-specific probe. Hybridization
occurred between 10 ug RNA per embryonic stage and 3.33x10Â°4 cpm of probe.
Undigested probe (P) was loaded at 1000 cpm and measured 267 bp. The protected
sodium channel sequence measured 237 bp in length.
