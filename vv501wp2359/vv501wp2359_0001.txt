Expression of GFLNI Sodium Channel mRNA at Embryonic Stages
of the Squid Loligo opalescens
ABSTRACT
Messenger RNA encoding GFLNI, the sodium channel proposed to exist in the
giant axon of the squid, was detected in embryos of Loligo opalescens. PCR analysis
and RNAse Protection Assay both confirm the initiation of GFLNI mRNA
expression at stage 25 of embryonic development. The level of GFLNI mRNA
expression was found to increase rapidly at stage 27, which immediately precedes
giant axon function. Expression levels progressively increase during late
developmental stages (28-30) which coincide with increased speed of the escape
response.
INTRODUCTION
The squid giant axon has been a popular model for studying the role of
sodium channels in electrical conduction. Extensive studies of the giant axon have
elucidated biophysical properties of the sodium channel, but molecular research
lags far behind. Two types of sodium channels in the squid have only recently been
sequenced and cloned. One type of sodium channel has been identified in the optic
nerve (Sato & Matsumoto, 1992), while another, GFLNI, has been found in the
stellate ganglion (Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993).
GFLNI represents a putative sodium channel that is expressed in the
neurons which form the giant axon. Evidence from RNAse Protection Assay and
Northern blot hybridization confirm that giant fiber lobe neurons express mRNA
which corresponds to GFLNI. Because voltage clamp experiments reveal that one
major sodium channel type exists in the giant axon, GFLNI has been implicated as
the sodium channel type which is responsible for electrical conduction in the squid
