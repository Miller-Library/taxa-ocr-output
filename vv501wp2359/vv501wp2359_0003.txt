RNA Isolation
For each stage of development, approximately 75-100 embryos were
homogenized in a Dounce Homogenizer containing 2 ml guanidine thiocyanate
(50 g guanidine thyocyanate, 0.5 g n-lauryl sarcosine, 2.5 ml of 1M sodium citrate;
pH 7.0) and 0.014 ml beta-mercaptoethanol (Cooperman et al , 1987). Adult stellate
ganglion and adult gill tissue were homogenized and subjected to the same
treatment as the embryos. 1.5 ml of the homogenate was gently layered over 550 ul
cesium chloride (5.7 M) and centrifuged in a Beckmann RP 55-S Swinging Bucket
Rotor for 3 hours at 55,000 rpm and 22'C. The RNA pellet was carefully separated
and resuspended in 100 ul TE-SDS solution containing 0.1% SDS. The RNA was
subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA density
was quantified by spectrophotometry and the extent of RNA degradation was
determined by running 2 ug of RNA on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide.
Detection of GFLNI by Polymerase Chain Reaction
A sample of RNA (3 ug) from each developmental stage was used as a
template for cDNA synthesis using ÜSB Reverse Transcriptase. The standard
conditions for USB RT were slightly modified. Äfter an ethanol wash, the RNA
was resuspended in 10.75 ul sterile water and set in a 65°C water bath for 3 minutes.
Each reaction component was added in a scaled-down volume (0.4X) from the ÜSB
protocol: 5.0 ul RT buffer, 5.0 ml dNTP (10 mM total nucleotide pool), 2.5 ul oligo
dT primer (10 uM), 1.0 ul RNAsin, 1.25 ul reverse transcriptase (MMLV). The
reaction was allowed to incubate for 1 hour at 37°C. The temperature was then
raised to 95°C for 5 minutes. The CDNA was subjected to phenol/chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation.
