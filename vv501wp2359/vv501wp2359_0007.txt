Because PCR is very sensitive and amplification is exponential rather than
linear, PCR data is difficult to analyze quantitatively as a means of determing levels
of mRNA expression. RNAse Protection Assay relies on hybridization between the
probe and the mRNA. Because this molecular binding process occurs on a one-toÂ¬
one basis, the intensities of the radio-labelled bands give more reliable data
regarding the level of Na channel expression.
Results from RNAse Protection Assay performed with the probe described
above and mRNA isolated at a series of developmental stages are presented in
Figure 4. As demonstrated by the presence of fully protected bands, GFLNI mRNA
is first expressed at stage 25, but at relatively low amounts. Expression steps up
sharply at stage 27 and then increases progressively, attaining a relatively high level
at stage 30. Levels of sodium channel mRNA in adult stellate ganglion tissue are
also very high, as previously demonstrated (Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993).
DISCUSSION
This study of the expression of GFLNI mRNA in squid embryos holds many
implications about the development of the giant axon system. Most specifically,
correlates between the levels of GFLNI mRNA expression and
anatomical/behavioral development can now be proposed.
At embryonic stage 25, RNAse Protection Assay detected a relatively low
level of GFLNI mRNA. The appearance of the sodium channel at this stage of
development coincides with the beginning of mantle contraction in response to
mantle contraction of the tentacles . This same study showed that morphologically
distinct giant axons do not appear until stage 26 (Gilly et al , 1991). These findings
suggest that GFLNI mRNA detected at stage 25 may be expressed by the non-giant
motoneurons , or that a lag time could exist when GFLNI mRNA is expressed in
the developing neurons destined to form the giant axon prior to the actual fusion
