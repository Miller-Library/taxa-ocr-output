Polymerase Chain Reaction detected the presence of GFLNI among the pool
of various CDNA. The primers SNC2 and SNC3 (Rosenthal & Gilly, 1993) were
used to amplify the segment of GFLNI from nucleotide 3720 to 4640. The predicted
size of this fragment is 921 base pairs. For each microliter of CDNA suspended in
NaAc/EtOH solution, the PCR reaction mixture consisted of 2.5 ul Taq buffer (10X),
2.5 ul dNTP (8mM total nucleotide pool), 1.25 ul SNC 2 (sodium channel primer)
1.25 ul SNC 3 (sodium channel primer), 17 ul sterile water, 0.03 ul Tag DNA
Polymerase, and 1 drop of mineral oil.
PGFLNI served as the positive control. To determine the sensitivity of PCR,
serial dilutions of this plasmid were subjected to PCR, and the amplified products
were separated on a 1% agarose gel.
A Model 480 Thermocycler (Perkin Elmer) was used to run the PCR. The
PCR process consisted of 35 cycles. In all cycles, denaturation occurred at 94°C and
elongation at 72°C. In the first five cycles, annealing was at 60'C and followed a 2
minute temperature ramp. In the remaining cycles, annealing occurred at 55°C
and the ramp was omitted. Ötherwise, all other target temperatures were attained
immediately. Each of these steps (denaturation, annealing, and elongation) in all
cycles continued for 1 minute. A 1% agarose gel was run with 8.0 ul of the
amplified CDNA from each stage of development.
Detection of GFLNI by RNAse Protection Assay
An RNAse Protection Assay was performed with radio-labelled sodium
channel probes. Probes were synthesized with the following components: 2 ul
buffer (5X), 1 ul DTT (0.1 M), 0.5 ul RNAsin, 2 ul rATP/TGTP/TCTP ribonucleoside
mix (7.5 mM total pool), 1.2 rUTP (100 uM), 2.5 ul P32-rUTP (25 uCi, 800 Ci/mMol),
0.5 ul linearized plasmid template (50 ng pNZ5- cut with Ndel; Rosenthal & Gilly,
1993), and 0.5 ul T7 RNA polymerase (30 units/ ul). The undigested probe
