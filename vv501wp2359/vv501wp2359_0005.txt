incorporates two regions: 237 bases from the 3' end of GFLNI from the Ndel site in
the coding region through the untranslated region, and 30 bases of the vector to the
T7 promoter site (Rosenthael & Gilly, 1993). The reaction mixture was incubated
for 1 hour at 37°C. Then 1 ul of RQ-1 DNAse (Promega) was added and incubation
continued for 30 more minutes at 37°C. Reaction products were subjected to
phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Yeast tRNA (10 ug) was
used as carrier.
1005 cpm of probe were hybridized to 10 ug RNA from each embryonic stage.
The assay solution included 3 ul hybridization buffer (4 M NaCl, 400 mM PIPES,
and 10 mM EDTA) and 24 ul deionized formamide. The hybridization mixtures
were heated to 85’C for 5 minutes and then incubated at 48°C overnight.
Digestion of single-stranded RNA was performed by adding 300 ul of RNAse
digestion solution to each sample and incubating for one hour at room
temperature. The RNAse digestion solution consisted of 300 mM NaCl, 5mM
EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 10 ug/ml RNAse A, and 0.4 ug/ml RNAse TI. To terminate
the digestion, 20 ul of 10% SDS and 2 ul proteinase K (25 mg/ml) were added to the
samples, which were then incubated further for 15 minutes at 37°C. The reaction
products were phenol extracted and ethanol precipitated with 25 ug tRNA as
carrier. Samples representing each stage of development were run on a 6%
acrylamide sequencing gel. Also, 1000 cpm of undigested probe for GFLNI mRNA
was run in the gel after loading. Kodak XAR-5 film with one intensifying screen
was exposed to the gel for three days at -70°C.
RESULTS
Analysis of Sensitivity of PCR for Amplifying GFLNI CDNA
The PCR primers, SNC2 and SNC3, bind to very specific regions of GFLNI.
SNC2 corrresponds to nucleotides 3720 to 3754 of GFLNI, whereas SNC3 recognizes
