giant axon. However, GFLNI may also be present in other neurons in the stellate
ganglion as well (Rosenthal, 1993).
Much work has been done with adult squids regarding sodium channel
characterization. However, in squid embryos, interest in the giant axon system has
only recently been spurred. Previous embryonic work includes the anatomical
development of the stellate ganglion and the ontogeny of the escape response (Gilly
et al, 1991). Also, structural organization of the first order giant axon system in
squid embryos has been documented (Martin, 1965). This paper focuses on the
expression of GFLNI sodium channel mRNA during embryonic development of
Loligo opalescens using Polymerase Chain Reaction and RNAse Protection Assay
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Staging of Loligo opalescens embryos
Squid egg cases were collected from Monterey Bay and stored under running
sea water at 10°C. Two to three egg cases were dissected every day until hatching.
During dissection, the outer membrane of the egg case was sliced open and
separated from the egg mass. Dissecting forceps were used to remove the embryos
from their inner egg membranes and periviteline fluid. The external yolk sac was
detached from each embryo under a dissecting microscope and discarded. Loligo
opalescens embryos from the following stages were collected: 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
29+, 29++, and 30 (hatchlings). The embryo was staged according to the
characteristics described by Segawa et al (1988) and Gilly et al (1991). Embryos were
then washed with filtered sea water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70°C
until homogenization.
