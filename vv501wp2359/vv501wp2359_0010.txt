My undying thanks extend to William Gilly who has given me the support to
pursue my project and to focus my efforts very well. Also, I owe much gratitude to
Josh Rosenthal who mentored me everyday and sacrificed much of his time for my
project. Also, many thanks to Marie Perri and Simone Alin, who both gave me
companionship in lab, working space in lab, and good advice. I would like to thank
Alberte’s lab for use of the ultracentrifuge, Thompson’s lab for use of the camera¬
microscope, Weissman's lab for use of the PCR machine, and Power's lab for use of
