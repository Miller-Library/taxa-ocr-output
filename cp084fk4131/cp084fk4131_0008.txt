Appendix I figs. 83 & 841. Further asymmetry in the distribution of
the granules/vesicles could be seen in the 6.5 hr samples (figs. 16, &
17). Also, micromeres with associated nuclei could be seen
surrounding the granule/vesicle filled cells, macromeres as shown in
figs. 15 & 16 Icompare with sectioned Crepidula (29-cell), Appendix
fig. 851.
DISCUSSION
The FFSEM images of this study are most interesting when
compared with Conklin's images of the developing Crepidula and
with the light microscope images. One set of structures seen in both
the FFSEM images and Conklin's images is polar bodies. These
structures were first found on the Haliotis at the 2-cell stage (figs.
11 & 12), but are shown to emerge in the Crepidula prior to first
cleavage (Appendix 1 fig. 2). Also, a comparison should be made
between the nuclei seen in the FFSEM images and Conklin's sectioned
images. In both cases, the nuclei could only be seen in micromere
cells (figs. 16 &17 and Appendix I figs. 84 & 85) (either the cells
containing the granules had no nucleus, or the granules were shielding
