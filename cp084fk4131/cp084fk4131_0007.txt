In contrast, veiws of the cell surface differed according to
developmental stage (compare figs. 7,1 1,14, &15 ). The cell surfaces
of oocytes, but not embryos, were wrinkled (perhaps the oocytes are
more suceptible to osmotic changes than are the embryos) (fig. 7). By
comparison, the cell surfaces of the embryos were relatively smooth,
but at high magnification (x 2.5 K) they showed irregularities which
may have been caused by the underlying yolk granules (fig. 12). The
polar bodies, seen only on 2-cell and 8-cell specimens, were located
at the animal pole of these embryos (figs. 11,12, &14). The sperm
cells, also seen primarily on 2-cell and 8-cell specimens, were found
on the chorion and on the cell's exterior (figs. 11,12, &14).
Intracellular lmages
The intracellular structures visualized were granules/vesicles and
nuclei. Most of the fractured vesicles were empty, but some
contained what appeared to be fractured or intact yolk granules (figs.
7-10, 13, 16, 17). The granule distribution in oocytes to 2-cell-stage
was in mosrt cases uniform (figs. 7-10, 13 but in a few cases some
localization was seen (figs. 7-10, 13. A polar distribution of
granules could be seen by the eight-cell stage (4.5 hrs PF) as shown in
fig. 13 lcompare with sectioned Crepidula (4-cell and 12-cell).
