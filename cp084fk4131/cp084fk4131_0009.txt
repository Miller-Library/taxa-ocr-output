the nuclei from view).
The most interesting comparison involves the FFSEM images, LM
images, and Conklin's images. First, the distribution of
granules/vesicles in the FFSEM images seems to correspond to the
distribution of pigment in the light microscope images (seen most
easily by comparing fig. 13 to fig. 4). Second, these pigment and
granule/vesicle distributions seem to correspond to the patterns of
yolk distribution shown in Conklin's images of the Crepidula (this
relation can be visualized most easily be comparing figs. 16 & 17 to
Appendix I fig. 85). Therefore, it is likely that the granules/vesicles
seen in the FFSEM images and the brown pigment seen in the LM
images are yolk granules which are being distributed in the
developing Haliotis embryos in a manner similar to that of the
Crepidula.
The technique of FFSEM used in this investigation is a relatively
simple, but highly effective, method for visualization of intracellular
structures: FFSEM provided a unique three-dimensional view of the
internal as well as external aspects of the embryo. With a few
modifications, FFSEM could become particularly useful for viewing
intracellular vesicles. Such improvements might include, but not
