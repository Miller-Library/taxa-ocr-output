necessarily be limited to reduced lipid extraction, reduced osmotic
changes, elimination of "ice" crystal formation, and most importantly
improved membrane resolution. Lipid extraction might be reduced
simply by the shortening of the duration of glutaraldehyde fixation,
but if this proves ineffective or other-wise undesireable, then
simultaneous fixation by gluteraldehyde and osmium tetroxide
mixtures might be used. In addition, intracellular membranes might
be better resolved by metallic impregnation of the the phospholipids
from which they are comprised. Then, to prevent osmotic disruption,
sucrose (or other compounds) might be added (probably prior to
osmium tetroxide fixation), or changes in drying media might be
tried. Also, "ice" crystal formation, if occuring, might be remedied by
a change in the drying medium, or by the addition of an "antifreeze" to
the medium. Finally, selective alignment of embryos (if possible) and
or serial-fracture of embryos might produce images which are more
easily interpretable than those obtained by the present method of
FFSEM.
