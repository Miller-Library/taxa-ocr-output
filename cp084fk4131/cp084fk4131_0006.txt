micromere quartet of four translucent, green cells resting on a
macromere quartet of four larger opaque, brown cells (figs. 4-5. For
comparision to 8-cell Crepidula see Appendix 1 fig. 13). By 6.5 hrs
PF, the embryos were in the 25-cell stage consisting of twenty-one
micromeres and four macromeres. The mass of the micromere region
had increased and the mass of the macromere region had
corespondingly decreased (fig. 6. For comparision to 25-cell
Crepidula see Appendix I fig. 24). By 9 hrs PF, the embryos were
approximately sixty cells, of which four were macromeres, and
approximately 56 were micromeres. The micromeres were in the
process of enveloping the macromeres (No photographed image. For
60-cell Crepidula see Appendix 1 fig. 36)

Extracellular lmages
Extracellular items of interest included the chorion, the cell
surface, polar bodies and sperm. The chorion was seen at all stages of
development; its general charcteristics did not differ from stage to
stage but its relation to the oocyte or embryo varied significantly
because of differences in the fracture plane (compare figs. 7, 8, &11).
