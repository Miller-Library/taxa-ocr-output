DW. Fixed samples were then mixed (1:1) with a warm suspension of
3% agar, pipeted onto paraf ilm sheets, air cooled for 1-2 min,
dehydrated by immersion for at least 10 minutes each in 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% ethanol, frozen by immersion in liquid
nitrogen (1-2 min), fractured with a chilled razor and then
reimmersed in 100% ethanol. Fractured samples were then either
critical-point dried or immersed in hexamethyldisilazane for final
drying, "glued" onto metal stubs via colloidial graphite with the
fractured suface facing upwards, and sputter-coated with gold.
Coated samples were then viewed under the SEM or stored in a
dessicator until viewing.
RESULTS
Development of Embryos
In the batch of embryos used, 95% of the embryos developed
normally during the first nine hours, 3% did not undergo cleavage, and
28 developed abnormally (fig. 1). At twenty-four hrs PF 67% of the
embryos showed normal but slow growth, 30% of the embryos
appeared abnormal, and 3% had not undergone cleavage.
