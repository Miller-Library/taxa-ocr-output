FIGURE LEGEND
Fig. 1. Dark-field image (6.5 h stage) showing an abnormal embryo
(upper-left), and an unfertilized oocyte (lower-right).
Fig. 2. Dark-field image (2 h stage) showing 2-cell embryos with
sperm attatched to chorion.
Fig. 3. Bright-field image (3 h stage) showing a 4-cell embryo
Fig. 4. Dark-field image (4.5 h stage) showing 8-cell embryos with
sperm attatched to chorion and asymmetrical distribution of
pigments: green is present mostly in the micromeres and brown is
present mostly in the macromeres.
Fig. 5. Same as fig. 4.
Fig. 6. Dark-field image (6.5 h stage) showing 25-cell embryos
with sperm attatched to chorion and asymmetrical distribution of
pigments
Fig. 7. FFSEM image of an oocyte showing the cell surface and
internal structures (vesicles,fractured granules and intact
granules). (x660)
Fig. 8. FFSEM image of oocytes showing variations in the fractue
plane, the chorion, the cell surface and internal structures
(vesicles, fractured granules and intact granules). (x200)
Fig. 9. FFSEM image (20 min stage) showing the internal structure
of a L-cell embryo (vesicles, fractured granules and intact
granules). (x1000)
Fig. 10. FFSEM image (1 h stage) showing the cell surface, chorion,
and internal structure of a Lcell embryo (vesicles, fractured
granules and intact granules are asymmetrically distributed).
