cell surface, chorion, sperm, polar bodies, and granules. (x360)

cell surface, chorion, sperm, and a polar body. (x2.5 k)
Fig. 13. FFSEM image (4.5 h stage) showing the intertnal
characteristics of an 8-cell embryo: asymmetrical distribution of
granules and vesicles (most of the granules and vesicles are
present in the macromeres, while few are present at the perimeter
of the micromeres). (x650)
Fig. 14. FFSEM image (4.5 h stage) showing the extertnal
characteristics of an 8-cell embryo: two polar bodies resting in
the cleavage furrow of the micromere quartet which, in turn, is
resting on the macromere quartet. In addition, a bit of chorion and
some sperm can be seen on the cell surface. (x650)
Fig. 15. FFSEM image (6.5 h stage) showing the extertnal
characteristics of a fractured 25-cell embryo: the cell surface and
the cleavage pattern of the micromeres (foreground) as well as
macromeres (background) can be seen. (x650)
Fig. 16. FFSEM image (6.5 h stage) showing the intertnal and
external characteristics of a 25-cell embryo: asymmetrical
distribution of granules and vesicles is a key feature of the
internal morphology. Note that nuclei can be seen in some of the
granule-free micromeres. On the exterior, the cell surface and the
chorion can be seen. (x650)
