Light Microscope Observations
For purposes of interpreting the images obtained by FFSEM, it is
necessary to describe development as seen under the light
microscope.
Examination of Haliotis oocytes and embryos via the light
microscope provided a general view of its development which seems
to follow that of the Crepidula as described by E. G. Conklin in 1897
(see Appendix I for dev. of Crepidula). The 150 u oocytes were
loosely surrounded by a translucent chorion and exhibited no
polarity/asymmetry in shape or color (fig. 1). When viewed
macroscopically, the eggs were green; however, under the microscope
the eggs were green-brown and there was no appearent pigment
localization (as opposed to later). By 2 hrs PF, the embryos had
developed into two seemingly identical cells, equivalent in size and
color (fig. 2. For comparision to 2-cell Crepidula see Appendix! fig.
5). By 3 hrs PF, the embryos were in a four cell stage with
blastomeres similar in size and color (fig. 3. For comparision to
4-cell Crepidula see AppendixI fig. 11). By 4.5 hrs PF, the embryos
were at the eight-cell stage and asymmetry was now apparant in
blastomere size and yolk distribution. These embryos consisted of a
