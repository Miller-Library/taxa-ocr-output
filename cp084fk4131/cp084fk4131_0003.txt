were maintained at 15 C° within a 1000 ml beaker containing
microfiltered sea water (MSW) and were suspended 1.5 cm off the
beaker bottom via nylon mesh (Nytex, 120 u) at a concentration below
5/ml, and aerated with an air-stone.
Light Microscopy
Whole oocytes and embryos were viewed at 0.0 and 30 min
post-fertilization (PF), and then viewed and photographed at 2, 3, 4.5,
6.5, and 9 h PF with a phase-contrast microsope using dark-field or
bright-field settings. Photographs were made on 100 ASA color slide
film with a fully-automatic 35 mm camera conected via a T-mount to
the light microscope.
Freeze-Fracture Preparation for Scanning Flectron Microscopy
Oocytes and cultured embryos were concentrated with nylon mesh
(Nytex, 120 u) and samples (0.1-0.25 ml) were pipeted into 25m1
beakers for fixation at 0.0, 10, 20, and 30 min PF, and then at 1, 2, 3,
4.5, and 6.5 h PF. Specimens were fixed in 22 glutaraldahyde in 802
MSW containing 1.22 HEPES (pH 7.3) for a minimum of 2 hrs at 4° (at
min ratio Iml Sample : 50ml Fix), washed twice for 5 min in distilled
water (DW), and post-fixed for 5-1 hr at 23 C° at a 1:1 ratio in 12
osmium tetroxide prepared in MSW, and rewashed twice for 5 min in
