ABSTRACT
The technique of freeze-fracture in conjunction with scanning
electron microscopy (FFSEM) was developed and succesfully used for
viewing the developing morphology of the abalone embryo, Haliotis
rufescens The nucleus and intracellular granules/vesicles could be
visualized and changes in the distribution of granules followed during
embryogenesis. The FFSEM procedure could be further developed as a
research tool, and 1 present some possible improvements in the
procedure.
