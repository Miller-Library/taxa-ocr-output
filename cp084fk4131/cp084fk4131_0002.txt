INTRODUCTION
The development of marine gastropods has been studied since the
late 1800's, and excellent accounts have been published, e.g., on
Crepidula (Conklin 1897), Trochus (Robert 1902), Patel/a (Patten
1886), and Haliotis (Crofts 1937). Yet, very little is known about
the ultrastructure, aside from EM studies on processes of
fertilization and maturation (Longo and Anderson 1969, 1970). Here
report on the Haliotis embryo, using a novel procedure, FFSEM.
report on both surface views but especially internal structures. The
most interesting aspect of FFSEM is the ability to view intracellular
granules/vesicles, most probably yolk granules, and their change in
distribution during their development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Aquisition and Cuturing of Embryos
The reported studies were all done with one batch of oocytes and
embryos, obtained from the Granite Canyon Laboratory of the
California Department of Fish and Game (Carmel, CA). The embryos
