denaturation of proteins during heat stress (Feder and Hofmann 2000). Therefore, the higher
incidence of heat-shock response in warm-adapted Tegula congeners indicates more frequent
protein denaturation.
Facing the consequences of frequent heat shock may require significant energy
expenditures- it has been suggested that mid- to high-intertidal organisms may have higher
costs of living’ as a result (Somero 2002). Differential growth rates of Tegula congeners are
consistent with this assertion. T. montereyi grows the fastest, T. brunnea is intermediate, and T.
funebralis, the highest-occurring species, grows most slowly (Frank, 1965; Watanabe, 1982).
Differences in heart rate observed in this study may also be related to energetic costs. T.
funebralis heart rates were significantly higher than the two subtidal species, even when
corrected for differences in body size (Fig. 9). Perhaps an elevated cardiac output is necessary in
T. funebralis in order to fuel the cellular processes associated with its frequent heat shock
responses.
The results of the acclimation experiment may have great ecological significance, since
thermal acclimation capacity can be used to predict a species’ susceptibility to global climate
change (Stillman 2003). In this study, T. funebralis heart function showed the least acclimatory
plasticity of all three congeners. Acclimation to 22°C failed to induce a significant ABT increase
in T. funebralis. Considering this result, and the finding that T. funebralis is living closer to its
cardiac limits, it seems that T. funebralis may be at greater risk in the event of global warming
than its subtidal congeners. Even a 1 or 2°C increase in average global temperatures could
physiologically compromise these animals.
