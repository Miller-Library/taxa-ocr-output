INTRODUCTION:
The marine intertidal is one of the harshest environments on earth. Organisms inhabiting
the transition from land to sea face a host of environmental stresses, including temperature
variation, desiccation stress, wave force, and salinity (Vernberg and Vernberg 1972; Denny
1988). The daily tidal cycle is largely responsible for the drastic, rapid temperature fluctuations
typical of the intertidal, exposing organisms to alternating terrestrial and aquatic conditions.
Many species inhabit discrete vertical zones in the marine intertidal (Connell 1961).
These zonation patterns are established by a host of abiotic factors, such as temperature and
aerial exposure, as well as biotic factors like competition and predation (Connell 1961; Edney.
1961; Paine 1969). Studies have shown that species inhabiting mid- to high-intertidal zones
experience more extreme environmental stresses than subtidal species. For instance, some high-
dwelling gastropods can undergo body temperature increases of 20-25Â°C during low tide
emersions (Hofmann and Somero 1995), whereas many subtidal animals never face temperatures
above that of the ambient seawater.
These drastic differences in thermal habitats are possible only because intertidal
organisms have differentially evolved adaptations for thermal tolerance. Numerous studies have
shown that the upper vertical limits of species distributions are correlated with thermal tolerance
limits (Wethey 1983; Jensen and Armstrong 1991; Stillman and Somero 2000). A suite of
physiological, biochemical, and morphological factors contribute to the establishment of these
limits- mitochondrial respiration, nerve function, action potential generation, heart function,
protein stability, and heat-shock protein response are some such traits (Somero 2002; Stillman
and Somero 1996).
