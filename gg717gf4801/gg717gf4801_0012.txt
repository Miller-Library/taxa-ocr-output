ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I would like to thank my advisor, Geroge Somero, for all of his guidance, support, and
enthusiasm. Members of the Somero Lab have been extremely helpful as well—special thanks
go to Caren Braby and Maxine Chaney for sharing their invaluable heart rate expertise, and to
Brad Buckley for his help with equipment for my acclimation experiment. l’m also very grateful
to Jim Watanabe, Freya Sommer, and Will Tyburczy, who collected many T. montereyi
specimens for me during their SCUBA dives.
