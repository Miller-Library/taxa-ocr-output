DISCUSSION:
This study found a strong positive correlation between the cardiac thermal tolerance
limits of Tegula congeners and their vertical position. In the two subtidal species, heart failure
occurred at significantly lower temperatures than in T. funebralis, the higher-dwelling congener.
A positive correlation was also found between vertical position and eurythermality. T. funebralis
hearts proved capable of enduring the warmest and coldest temperatures, while T. brunnea and
T. montereyi, the lower-dwelling species, had narrower cardiac thermal tolerance ranges.
Comparing the average ABTs of field-acclimatized species to their maximum habitat
temperatures exposes a critical finding. T. funebralis appears to be living much closer to its
upper cardiac limits than do its subtidal relatives. In their mid-intertidal habitats, T. funebralis
individuals regularly reach temperatures above 30°C. Body temperatures as high as 33°C have
even been reported (Tomanek and Somero 1999). Therefore, maximum habitat temperature of T.
funebralis is actually higher than its ABT (31.5°), meaning this species may experience
compromised heart function on a regular basis. This is certainly not the case for the subtidal
S, well below its
congeners. Maximum habitat temperature for T. brunnea is approximately 2
ABT of 25.0°C. Similarly, T. montereyi is unlikely to exceed 20°C, which is far from its ABT of
24.2°.
This finding- that the higher-occurring Tegula species is living closer to its thermal
limits- is not unprecedented. Previous studies of Tegula thermal tolerance have made parallel
conclusions. For example, heat shock experiments have shown that mid-to high intertidal
species such as T. funebralis and the subtropical species T. rugosa are likely to induce heat shock
response more frequently than subtidal species such as T. brunnea and T. montereyi (Tomanek
and Somero 1999). Activation of the heat-shock proteins occurs in response to thermal
