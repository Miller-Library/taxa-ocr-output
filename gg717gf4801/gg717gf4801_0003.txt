One of these thermal tolerance parameters, heart function, is the subject of this study.
Considering that a functioning circulatory system is critical for oxygen delivery to animal
tissues, the limits of heart function surely contribute to the establishment of thermal optima.
Marine snails of the Genus Tegula were chosen for this cardiac study. Tegula is an ideal genus
for heat stress research because of the abundance of closely related species that occupy diverse
thermal habitats and discrete vertical zones (Watanabe 1984; Hellberg 1998). Three
differentially distributed temperate Tegula congeners were selected. T. funebralis inhabits the
low- to mid-intertidal, and can encounter temperatures over 33°C when emersed. T. brunnea is
found in the low-intertidal to subtidal zone. It is exposed to air only during low low tides and
experiences maximum habitat temperatures of approximately 23°C. Finally, T. montereyi is an
exclusively subtidal species, whose body temperature never exceeds ambient seawater
temperatures.
The Tegula congeners selected for this experiment have been studied extensively with
respect to thermal tolerance. Whole animal thermal limits have been determined—the LTso
values (the temperature at which 50% mortality is observed) for T. funebralis, T. brunnea, and T.
montereyi are 42.5°C, 36°C and 36°C, respectively (Tomanek and Somero 1999). Interspecific
differences in enzyme thermal stabilities have also been characterized in these congeners. For
example, the thermal stabilities of malate dehydrogenases from five Tegula congeners increase
with increasing vertical position (Somero 2002). Results of Tegula heat shock protein (hsp)
experiments correspond with these findings (Tomanek and Somero 1999, 2000; Tomanek and
Sanford 2003). The synthesis of hsps in T. funebralis is initiated, maximized, and terminated at
higher temperatures than in T. brunnea and T. montereyi (Tomanek and Somero 1999).
