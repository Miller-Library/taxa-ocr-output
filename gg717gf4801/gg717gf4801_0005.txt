Heart Rate Measurements
Using a small hand drill, two holes were drilled into the shell of each snail, adjacent to
the pericardial space. Prime drilling locations were determined initially by dissecting specimens
of each species and locating the heart in relation to shell coils. Ceramic-coated copper electrodes
were inserted into these holes and secured in place with SuperGlue"", positioned as close to the
heart as possible. To prevent the snails from emerging during experimentation, the outer lip of
each shell was glued to a clean glass microscope slide. The snails were suspended using metal
clamps that held cork pieces glued to the top of each shell. The two impedance wires in each
animal were connected to an impedance pneumograph, and the resulting signals were amplified
and recorded using PowerLab““ Data Acquistion System (Fig. 1). Heart rate measurements
were performed in filtered, aerated seawater, temperature-controlled by a Lauda"" waterbath
system. This setup accommodated a maximum of 6 animals per run.
For heat stress experiments, the waterbath temperature was held constant at 13°C for 1
hour, then increased at a rate that was determined to be environmentally realistic (1°C every 15
minutes). Äfter reaching 40°C, or once all specimens’ hearts had failed, whichever came first,
water temperature was decreased as rapidly as possible, to assess recovery of cardiac function.
Heart rate measurements were made every 7 minutes for the duration of the run.
Cold stress experiments were also performed. Animals were held at 13°C for one hour,
and then water temperature was decreased to nearly 0°C at a rate of 1°C every 10 minutes. Äfter
heart failure, temperature was returned to ambient. Following every run, the snails were
