ABTs and FLTs, were averaged for each species and acclimation condition, and statistical
significance of comparisons was assessed using ANOVA.
RESULTS:
Heart rates of snails from all three Tegula species increased in response to heat stress, up
to the ABT, after which they declined to zero (Fig. 2). Once temperature was reduced, all
species recovered cardiac function. Within 24 to 48 hours after experimentation, however, 92%
of T. funebralis specimens and 100% of T. brunnea and T. montereyi specimens had died. T.
brunnea had significantly slower heart rates, on average, than T. funebralis and T. montereyi, and
thus their break points were less obvious upon visual inspection (Fig. 2B). ABTs were easily
determined, however, by generating Arrhenius plots for each specimen (Fig. 3).
Significant interspecific differences in break temperatures were observed (pS.001). The
average ABTs for field-acclimatized T. funebralis, T. brunnea, and T. montereyi were
31.1+0.7°C, 25.0+0.5°C, and 24.2-0.7°C, respectively (Fig. 4). The differences between T.
funebralis and both subtidal congeners were statistically significant, but T brunnea and T.
montereyi did not have significantly different ABTs. These results establish a positive correlation
between upper cardiac limits and maximum habitat temperatures in Tegula congeners. Flatline
temperatures followed this trend as well. Average FLTs for T. funebralis, T. brunnea, and T.
montereyi were 39.4+0.2°C, 32.4+0.2°C, and 33.1+0.1°C, respectively (Fig. 4). Flatline
temperatures showed much less intraspecific variation than Arrhenius break temperatures, and all
interspecific FLT differences were statistically significant (pr.0001).
In response to cold stress, heart rates of all species showed gradual declines to zero. No
clear break points could be identified, so only FLTs were determined and compared. T.
