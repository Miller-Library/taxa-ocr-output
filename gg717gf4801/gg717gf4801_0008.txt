funebralis maintained cardiac function down to 2.1+0.2°C, while T. brunnea and T. montereyi
hearts failed at 3.5+0.3°C and 4.8+0.5°C, respectively. T. funebralis can therefore endure
significantly warmer and colder temperatures than its subtidal relatives (Fig. 5). Äfter all
specimens had flat-lined, temperature was rapidly returned to ambient, and all species recovered
heart function. Unlike the heat-stressed specimens, however, none of the cold-stressed snails
died during the three-day holding period following experimentation.
ABTs and FLTs were determined for 14°C and 22°C lab-acclimated snails of each species
in response to heat stress. The two subtidal congeners, T. brunnea and T. montereyi, showed
significantly higher ABTs after 22°C-acclimation than after 14°C-acclimation (Table 1). T.
funebralis ABTs, however, did not significantly increase in response to warm-acclimation. The
2°C-acclimated T. funebralis specimens had only slightly higher ABTs, on average, than the
14°C-acclimated snails (Fig. 6A). For all species, flatline temperatures appeared to be less
plastic than Arrhenius break temperatures. The difference between 14°C and 22°C-acclimated
FLTs was only approximately 1°C for all congeners (Fig. 6B).
Heart failure was not observed in the constant-temperature control run. Some heart rate
fluctuation occurred in the first hour, but after this initial acclimation, cardiac function remained
fairly stable in all the animals (Fig. 7). During the 7 day holding period following the run, all
control specimens were alive and functioning normally. These results indicate that the
experimental procedure was not a confounding variable.
Tegula body temperature was approximated using a gelatin-filled shell. As shown in Fig.
8, the gelatin temperature consistently lagged only about 0.5°C behind that of the water. This
suggests that, when immersed, Tegula tissue temperature approaches water temperature.
