All of my major findings on Tegula thermal tolerance are congruent with results of heat
stress experiments on porcelain crabs of the genus Petrolisthes. Many physiological aspects of
thermal tolerance, such as heart function and nerve function have been studied comparatively in
Petrolisthes congeners, and numerous significant correlations between vertical distribution and
thermal limits have been found (Stillman and Somero 1996, 2000; Stillman 2002, 2003). As for
cardiac function, the highest-occurring species, P. cinctipes and P. gracilis, have ABTs that are
higher and closer to maximum habitat temperatures than the ABTs of low-intertidal and subtidal
species. Also, cardiac limits and whole animal thermal limits of high-intertidal Petrolisthes
species show lower acclimation capacities than lower-occurring congeners (Stillman 2003).
Thus, warm-adapted Tegula species as well as warm-adapted Petrolisthes species appear
to be at highest risk in the event of global climate change. Although only two genera are
currently implicated, it does seem possible that this may be a broader trend in the marine
intertidal zone: high-occurring intertidal organisms, in general, could be more susceptible to the
effects of global warming.
