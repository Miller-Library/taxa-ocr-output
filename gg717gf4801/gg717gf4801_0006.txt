weighed and placed in a re-circulating water bath at 13-15°C for 72 hours. Each animal was
examined every 24 hours following experimentation to determine recovery and mortality rates.
In addition to temperature ramps, control runs were performed, to ensure that the stress of
the experimental set-up (which included drilling, invasive electrode placement, and gluing) was
not significantly contributing to the heart failure and mortality observed. In these runs, T.
funebralis and T. brunnea heart rates were monitored for 7 hours in the absence of heat stress—
temperature was held constant at 13°C. In the week following the experiment, the control snails
were closely monitored, to track recovery.
Snail body temperature was approximated using a Knox-gelatin-filled snail shell, since
gelatin has been shown to approximate the conductive properties of snail tissue (Tomanek and
Somero 1999). The artificial snail was prepared for a run, just like a living animal, and a
thermocouple probe was inserted into the gelatin. During a heat ramp, the gelatin-temperature
was recorded, in order to estimate snail body temperature in relation to water temperature.
Data Analysis
Heart rates were expressed as beats per minute and plotted over time for every run, to
visually assess cardiac responses to temperature change. Arrhenius plots were generated for
each animal by converting heart rate values to the natural logarithm of beats per minute and
plotting these values against a temperature transformation (1000/K). Arrhenius break
temperatures (ABTs) were determined using regression analyses to generate the best fitting line
on both sides of an inflection point on the Arrhenius plot. The intersection of these two
regression lines was taken as the ABT. Flatline temperatures (FLTs) were also determined as the
temperature at which the last the measurable heart beat occurred. Critical temperatures, both
