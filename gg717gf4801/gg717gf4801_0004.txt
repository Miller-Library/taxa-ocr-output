These Tegula studies demonstrate clear correlations between maximum habitat
temperatures and thermal tolerance limits. It is apparent that T. funebralis, the higher-occurring
intertidal species, has many physiological and biochemical adaptations allowing it to endure
warmer temperatures than its subtidal relatives. The purpose of this investigation was to
elucidate the role of heart function among these thermal adaptations, by determining and
comparing the upper and lower cardiac thermal tolerance limits of Tegula congeners from
different tidal heights.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Collection and care of specimens
Tegula specimens were collected from the intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove, California (36° 36’N, 121° 54’W). Snails of the lowest-dwelling species, T. montereyi,
were collected while SCUBA diving, and T. funebralis and T. brunnea were gathered on foot,
the latter during minus low tides. All specimens were adults of medium to large body size (20-
25 mm basal diameter), found in the upper region of their species’ vertical distribution. Äfter
collection, snails were held in re-circulating water baths of ambient seawater for 24 hours before
experimentation. These specimens were deemed ’field-acclimatized’.
Two aquaria were set up for the laboratory acclimation experiment—one at 14°C and one
at 22°C. Fifteen snails of each species were held in each tank for 15-19 days and fed fresh kelp
every three days. The water level of the tanks was kept high enough so that the animals could
never fully emerse themselves. At the end of the acclimation period heat ramps were run,
identical in design to those performed on the field-acclimatized specimens (see below).
