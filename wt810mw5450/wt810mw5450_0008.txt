to development. As shown, the active agent in chlorinated
sewage was hypochlorite, and the sperm were more sensitive
than the eggs. The sperm were sensitive to hypochlorite
concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm, whereas eggs could be
fertilized after an exposure to 4 ppm. Thus the sperm
was the critical gamete in regards to chlorinated sewage.
The experiment comparing chlorinated sewage to a
sea water solution containing the same amount of 'avail-
able chlorine' in the form of hypochlorite, yielded the
surprising result that the pure hypochlorite solution
was almost as toxic as the chlorinated sewage. The effects
of the hypochlorite simply over-rode most of the effects
of the sewage rather than being additive. This is some-
thing that should be more thoroughly investigated since
light, agitation, and organic constituents can cause a
breakdown in hypochlorite, and an increased rate of
hypochlorite decomposition in the sewage solution might
have made the two solutions appear more similar than they
really were. It is surprising that the oxidized and
chlorinated organics resulting from the chlorination did
not present a greater barrier to fertilization and
development.
These results are not conclusive enough to esplain
the observed distribution of adult Patiria on Pt. Pinos.
However they do indicate that the region on the south
side of the point from the channel west of the outfall
eastward through Cove C is unsuitable as a breeding site
for Patiria. Most importantly, the present results show
