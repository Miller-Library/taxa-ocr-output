0.2 ppm. Effects on the adult ranged from an abstinence
from feeding behavior in concentrations greater than 5%
sewage to death within 24 hours when placed near the
outfall.
The most probable reason the animals did not eat in
highly polluted water is that Patiria locates food by
chemoreception (Hyman, 1955). In high concentrations of
sewage the sensors might not be able to recognize or detect
the presence of food. Monterey sewage, which was unchlor-
inated, did not inhibit the feeding behavior below a
concentration of 10% sewage. In contrast Pacific Grove
sewage affected the feeding behavior at dilutions of 5%;
perhaps the hypochlorite has an effect on chemoreception,
also.
The results showed that the fertilization process
was highly susceptible to sewage and hypochlorite. Thus,
more than twice as many embryos were able to reach the
blastula stage in 10% and 5% sewage dilutions if the eggs
were fertilized before they were placed in the solutions.
That not all embryos in 5% to 10% sewage dilutions
successfully reached the blastula stage suggests that
there are other toxins in the sewage, which interfere
with processes of division or blastulation. Alternatively
the same toxins may be present, but the embryo may be
partially isolated from the environment by the presence
of the fertilization membrane.
The comparison of chlorinated versus unchlorinated
sewage showed that chlorinated sewage was far more toxic
