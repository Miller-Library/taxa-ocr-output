apparent; however no fertilization was achieved with sperm
that had been exposed to concentrations of hypochlorite
greater than 0.4 ppm. In contrast to the effects of
hypochlorite, no morphological effects of unchlorinated
sewage were observed with sperm or eggs.
The eggs are not as sensitive to the hypochlorite
as the sperm. After being exposed for 45 minutes to a
40 ppm solution there is no fertility, but full fertili-
zation is achieved by eggs when they are exposed to a 4.0
ppm concentration of the hypochlorite, washed, and then
fertilized.
The above results suggest that hypochlorite is the
major toxic ingredient in chlorinated sewage. To test
this, a hypochlorite solution in sea water was prepared
which was equivalent to the 'available chlorine' content
of a sample of chlorinated sewage. Eggs were then fer-
tilized in various dilutions of these two solutions. The
results, seen in figures 4 and 5, show that the effects on
both fertilization and development were very similar,
with the hypochlorite solution being only slightly less
toxic.
DISCUSSION
The gametes, early developmental stages, and adult
Patiria are all affected by sewage and its associated
levels of chlorination. Through its gametes, the starfish
is sensitive to concentrations of hypochlorite higher than
