of Tide Pool wl. There were a few individuals found in
the rocks mainly on the seaward side of that tide pool
where they were getting fresh sea water during most of the
day. The population density continued to increase toward
the western end of the point. On the northern side there
was an even distribution all of the way down the point.
Feeding Behavior
To test the effect of sewage on feeding behavior
Patiria were starved for two weeks by keeping them in a
tank without food. They were then placed into dilutions
of both chlorinated and unchlorinated sewage and 16 hours
later a fresh Mytilus californianus was cracked open and
placed under each animal. In a 5% concentration of sewage
Patiria were less apt to eat than when they were in fresh
sea water. When the concentration was increased to 10%
they did not eat at all. The starfish kept in sewage were
then placed back in fresh sea water. After 5 hours they
were again given a mussel, and all of them began to eat
within 5 minutes.
Embryonic Development in Pt. Pinos Water
Current studies of Pt. Pinos, done by students of
Hopkins Marine Station during April, 1970, indicate that
the sewage leaving the outfall was carried toward stations
1, 2, and 3. Fertilization was drastically affected in
water samples taken from this area (fig. 1). However once
the egg was fertilized, except in water from station 3
more than 94% of the eggs were able to reach the blastula
16.
