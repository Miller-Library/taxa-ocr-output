Pt. Pinos is located in Pacific Grove at the
southern end of Monterey Bay. A large portion of the point
is a rocky intertidal region. The rock-filled tide pools
and abundant algal growth provides an ideal area for the
starfish Patiria miniata, (Brandt, 1835) to grow. However
inthe immediate vicinity of the Pacific Grove sewage
outfall the intertidal region has been seriously disturbed,
and there are no Patiria living there. My project was
designed to determine whether the paucity of Patiria
could be attributed in part to the effects the sewage
might have on either the adults, the gametes, or the
early developmental processes.
I found that, in the highly polluted areas near the
outfall, the sewage killed the adults and in lower con-
centrations inhibited their feeding processes. In addition
chlorinated Pacific Grove sewage reduced the success in
fertilization with full fertilization only being achieved
below a 0.1% dilution. Even very low concentrations of
sewage were strong enough to cause a decrease in the rate
of development in the embryos.
Hypochlorite, the only individual component of the
sewage which was tested for toxicity, appeared to be the
major toxic constituent. It caused a reduction in the
fertility of the eggs and a decrease in the ability of
the sperm to effect fertilization.
