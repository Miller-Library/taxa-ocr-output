stage. No bipinnaria larvae were later found in the samples
raised in water taken from stations 1, 2, or 3 and the
larvae raised in waten taken from stations 4, 5, and 6 were
indistinguishable from the control.
Fertilization
The process of fertilization is affected by
sewage (fig. 2). Full fertilization is not attained until
there is a substantial dilution of the sewage. If it is
chlorinated, fertilization is affected over an even
greater range of dilutions (fig. 2).
When fertilized and allowed to develop for an hour
before being placed into sewage, the eggs were still sen-
sitive to sewage more concentrated than 5% (fig. 3). In
100% Monterey sewage, most of the eggs reached the 8- to
16-cell stage before stopping. Eggs placed in the
unchlorinated Pacific Grove sewage only attained the 4-
to 8-cell stage gefore being arrested. None of the eggs
in the chlorinated Pacific Grove sewage got beyond
1 cell, and most of them were cytolyzed and had lost all
internal unity (plates 1,2).
Because of the differences shown between the chlor-
inated and unchlorinated Pacific Grove sewage, further work
was done on the effects of hypochlorite (the major
product of chlorination, see Imhoff and Maskew, 1956).
In sea water containing 40 ppm hypochlorite, the
tails of the sperm became twisted and often broke. As the
solutions became more dilute, physical effects were not as
