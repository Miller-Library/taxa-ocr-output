METHODS AND MATERIALS
For each experiment gametes were taken from a single
male and a single female. The web between two rays was
cut to the central disc, and the gonads removed with
tweezers. To prepare the ovaries, they were washed twice
with filtered sea water and placed in 25 ml of sea water
in a beaker. Two ml of 10 M 1-methyladanine was then
added to the eggs to stimulate shedding and meiosis
(Stevens, 1970). One to two hours were necessary to
complete the shedding process.
The eggs were then divided into separate aliquots
for the various experiments. A testes, removed from a
male 5 to 10 minutes before fertilization, was washed
once with filtered sea water and then placed in 50 ml of
filtered sea water. Four-tenths ml of this solution was
used for fertilization of each aliquot of eggs. Since
fertilization success is related to the sperm concen-
tration, this standard volume provided a large excess of
sperm, while it kept the amount of sperm added to each
sample constant within any one experiment. Using a
standard also minimized the variation between expeniments.
One hundred and fifty to two hundred eggs were
counted to yield the percentages for the recorded data.
The series of sewage dilutions that were used in the
experiments was 100, 50, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1% by volume.
Filtered sea water was used to prepare these dilutions, and
the solution was made isotonic by the addition of sea salts.
