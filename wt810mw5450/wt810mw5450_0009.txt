that fertilization is sensitive to very low levels of
hypochlorite. Therefore, down current from the outfall
in areas where the sewage has been so diluted as to
produce no obvious damage and to be hard to detect, it
may still present a significant ecological threat.
SUMMARY
The gametes, early stages of development, and
adult Patiria are all affected by sewage and its asso-
ciated levels of chlorination. Effects on the adult
ranged from an abstinence from feeding behavior in
concentrations of sewage greater than 5%, to death within
24 hours when placed near the outfall.
The fertilization process was somewhat sensitive
to unchlorinated sewage and highly sensitive to chlorinated
sewage. Thus, more than twice as many embryos were able
to reach the blastula stage in 10% and 5% sewage solutions
if the eggs were fertilized before being placed in the
sewage dilutions.
Hypochlorite was found to be the active ingredient
in chlorinated sewage. The sperm were more sensitive to
the hypochlorite than the eggs, showing a reduction in
the ability to fertilize eggs in concentrations as low as
0.2 ppm.
Because of the high sensitivity of fertilization
to both chlorinated and unchlorinated sewage, the ecological
effects of the sewage may extend far down current from
the damaged area near the outfall.
