In the experiments using hypochlorite, a stock solu-
tion of 40 ppm was prepared using filtered sea water and
reagent grade Naocl. To terminate the exposure of eggs to
hypochlorite, the solution was drawn off and the eggs
washed twice with filtered sea water. Rather than wash
sperm to conclude their exposure to hypochlorite, an excess
of Na,S,O, was added to neutralize the hypochlorite.
The temperature was maintained between 12Â° and
15 9c by placing the test vessels in a plastic tub on the
sea table.
RESULTS
Population Survey
A rough study was made of the Patiria population
on Pt. Pinos. The intertidal region was examined at low
tide on three successive days and the general location
and number of any Patiria found was noted on a map. The
study may not reflect the natural distribution because of
the difficulty in locating all of the animals, and also
because the point is accessible to the public and animals
may have been removed or transfered.
There were no Patiria found on the south side of the
point from the channel west of the outfall all of the way
through Cove C. Three adults placed in a cage in area A
about 15 meters from the outfall were killed within 24
hours.
The starfish living closest to the outfall was
found on the edge of a highly damaged area at the mouth
