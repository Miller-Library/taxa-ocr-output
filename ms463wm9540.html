Rather. I hypothesize that the absence of
Petaloconchus, previously a reliable, easily obtainable source of
energy, led to increased feeding on these other sessile prey
species. Further study is needed to explore the impact of other
factors, such as individual sea star variation.
INTRODUCTION
The diets of various asteroids have been well studied (e.g.
Mauzey et. al 1968, Menge 1972, Nakashima 1974, Harrold 1981,
Herrlinger 1983). Observed prey choices and proportions in the
diets have been examined for several generalist sea stars.
Pisaster giganteus is a subtidal sea star which feeds by everting
its cardiac stomach on prey and digesting externally. Harrold
(1981) analyzed various aspects of its feeding ecology by
comparing the abundance of prey in the diet to availability
(factoring in numerical abundance, ease of capture and presence in
the same microhabitat), caloric yield and predator choice.
However, since then, little work has been done to follow up
this study and record or explain any temporal variation. Menge
(1972) reported temporal variation in prey choice by <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>L. hexactis</span>
prey, both daily (with the tides) and seasonally, as the
availability or ease of capture of different prey species varied.
Seasonal changes followed abundance patterns of calorie-rich or
calorie-poor species. However, studies have not been done to
explore variation in feeding ecology from year to year and make
comparisons to environmental changes such as prey abundance.
This study compared the diet of Pisaster giganteus to Harrold
(1981), with two main goals: (1) to record differences in diet
composition and prey abundance, and (2) to infer an explanation
from these results. The results showed several major dietary
changes correlated with the disappearance of a frequently eaten
species in the habitat. Analysis of these changes confirms
previous speculation on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pisaster : Exact'>Pisaster</span> foraging strategy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted in the kelp forest of the Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge (HMLR), Pacific Grove, California, within an
approximately 40 mx 40 m patch of kelp forest, centered on a
black cable that runs north-south through the kelp (Fig. 1). The
bottom consists mostly of rocky substrate, with some sandy areas,
I limited all data collection to rocky substrate, the preferred
habitat of Pisaster giganteus. Studies were conducted using
SCUBA, in 32 dives between April 23 and May 23, 1996.
The mean density of the sea stars was calculated from 47 10
m' circular quadrats. I placed these quadrats at random locations
by choosing random compass bearings and numbers of kicks (to a
limit of 15) from the center of the study site. I moved quadrats
to the next random location if more than half of the area fell on
sandy substrate. For each sea star I encountered in the quadrat,
I recorded size (length from the tip of the longest arm to the
opposite interradius) and overturned it to determine whether it
was feeding and the number and identity of any prey species. From
this, the proportion of feeding sea stars and the percent of each
prey species in the diet were calculated. Sea stars were returned
to approximately their original position after measurements were
taken.
The main criterion for a feeding observation was an everted
cardiac stomach. Some sea stars had prey items pressed against
the stomach, and others simply had an everted stomach, e.g. if the
prey was attached to the substrate. Several sea stars were in
crevices and inaccessible, and could not be overturned,
tabulated these sea stars in a separate category since their
feeding behavior could not be determined.
I collected additional feeding data by overturning and
recording any encountered sea stars in 20 m swaths perpendicular
to the cable. These swaths were examined as closely as the
quadrats so that the data would not be skewed to favor more
visible sea stars. The same sea stars may have been tabulated
more than once during the study, but repetition was most likely
uncommon and thus had little effect.
I compared the observed diet to Harrold (1981) by using the
Shannon-Weiner diversity index, the Morista overlap index and the
electivity index of Ivlev (1961). The Shannon-Weiner index was
calculated as H' - -Ep, ln p,, where p, is the proportion of the it
species.
The Morista overlap index was calculated as
22xy,/(Exj'+Ly2), where x, and y, are the proportions of the i
species in the diet in 1996 and 1981 respectively. The electivity
index of Ivlev (1961) was calculated as E' - (D-H)/(D4H), where D
= relative abundance of a given prey species in the diet, and H =
relative abundance of that species in the habitat.
I calculated the mean density of various prey items by
plaging quadrats at random compass bearings and kicks from the
center of the study site. More abundant snails <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula : Exact'>(Tegula</span> spp. and
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Calliostoma ligatum : Exact'>Calliostoma ligatum)</span> were counted within 0.25 m2 quadrats, 20 for
Tegula and 19 for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Calliostoma : Exact'>Calliostoma.</span> <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Tegula : PartialExact'>Tegula data</span> were supplied by Hunt
(1996). I counted 21 10 m’ circular quadrats for less abundant
species <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Astraea gibberosa : Exact'>(Astraea gibberosa,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mitra idae : Exact'>Mitra idae,</span> Serpulorbis squamigerus,

sessile species that aggregate on rocky substrate (Petaloconchus
montereyensis, Balanus spp., and polychaete worms) were measured
as percent cover, using 15 0.25 m quadrats divided into grids of
25 10 cm x 10 cm squares. The proportion of grid intersections
falling on a given species was used to estimate percent cover.
grouped polychaetes together since I initially did not distinguish
them in the diet. Balanus spp. were rare and thus also counted
individually within 1 m quadrats. Percent cover measurements
were used as estimates of relative abundance for Petaloconchus and
polychaetes, and relative abundance of individually counted prey
species was calculated separately as the density of a prey species
divided by the total density of all prey species in 1 m'.
To eliminate the effects of seasonal variations, only data
from Harrold (1981) taken during spring (late March through June)
were used. Calliostoma abundance numbers were compared to
measurements by Sellers (1977), taken during the same period and
in the same area as Harrold (1981).
RESULTS
During the study, I sampled 130 sea stars, of which 61
(46.93) were feeding. Eleven sea stars (8.53) were lodged in
crevices and inaccessible. The density of Pisaster giganteus was
1.15 + 1.47 per 10 m’ (mean + S.D.), not significantly different
from Watanabe (1984), t.=1.159. Based on size measurements of 124
sea stars, the mean size (+ S.D.) was 13.4 + 3.1 cm.
The most frequently found prey items were the barnacle
Balanus and the vermetid gastropod Serpulorbis, with relative
frequencies of 28.793 and 22.723 respectively (Fig. 2). No sea
stars were observed feeding on Petaloconchus. The species found
in the diet, in decreasing order of frequency, were Balanus spp.,
Serpulorbis, polychaetes, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula pulligo : Exact'>Tegula pulligo,</span> Calliostoma, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula montereyi : Exact'>Tegula

mendicus</span> and an unidentified mussel (tie).
The diet composition was very similar to Harrold (1981). The
Shannon-Weiner diversity index was 2.029 compared to 2.035
(Harrold, unpublished data). These diets, in terms of actual
species and proportions, also overlapped quite substantially
(Morista index - 0.667). A Chi-square analysis, however, showed a
statistically significant difference between the diets (y=28.3,
po0.005). Qualitatively, the largest differences in the diet
between Harrold (1981) and my study were in the frequencies of
Petaloconchus, Serpulorbis, Balanus and polychaete worms (Fig. 3).
The most abundant individually counted prey species was
Calliostoma, followed by <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. pulligo,</span> <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. montereyi,</span> <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. brunnea,</span>
Serpulorbis, Balanus spp., Mitra, Ceratostoma, Astraea and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Conus : Exact'>Conus</span>
(Table 1). No Petaloconchus was encountered while recording
abundance data. Polychaetes had a 6.253 cover.
Only Petaloconchus had a significantly different abundance
from previous measurements (p.0.01, Table 1). No Petaloconchus
was observed in the quadrats, although it was the most abundant
prey species (18.83 cover) in Harrold (1981). A qualitatively
large increase in Serpulorbis abundance was statistically
insignificant.
Prey species with the greatest changes in the diet were
compared to changes in relative abundance (Fig. 4). Balanus and
Serpulorbis both increased in the diet more than in the habitat
(Balanus abundance actually decreased).
The increase of
polychaetes in the diet was approximately the same as the increase
in abundance, and the disappearance of Petaloconchus was likewise
reflected in both the diet and the habitat. The relative
proportion of prey species in the diet and abundance in the
habitat were used to calculate the electivity indices for each of
the species now (Table 2) and in Harrold (1981) (Table 3). For
the species analyzed in Fig. 4, the electivity indices were
compared (Fig. 5). These indices increased for both Balanus and
Serpulorbis and decreased for polychaetes.
DISCUSSION
The relative frequency of polychaetes in the diet increased
by approximately the same amount as their relative abundance. The
dietary increase of polychaetes can thus be explained by the sea
stars' taking more worms in proportion to their higher
availability, rather than making a choice or adjustment to their
diet. However, the increased relative frequency of Balanus and
Serpulorbis in the diet was larger than any abundance changes,
which suggests another cause.
According to foraging theory, a predator must make choices to
maximize energy input while minimizing effort and difficulty to
gain that energy (Stephens and Krebs 1986). Emlen (1966)
demonstrated this with two species of carnivorous gastropods,
which optimized foraging with respect to time and energy
conservation. Menge (1974) showed how a predaceous snail made
foraging choices to maximize biomass intake per time and decrease
search time. Unpredictability of prey species has also been
linked to generalization of diets and prey choice (Menge 1972).
Harrold (1981) found that regardless of the relative
availability of T. pulligo (high caloric yield) and Petaloconchus
(low caloric yield), some Petaloconchus was always taken. He
hypothesized that this was due to the uncertainty of capturing T.
pulligo, which exhibits an escape response and is often found in a
different microhabitat than Pisaster. The strategy was thus to
always take some abundant but low-energy prey since even abundant
high-energy prey might not be reliably available.
Both species that increased the most in the diet, Balanus and
Serpulorbis, are sessile species, and thus cannot escape a
foraging sea star. Algae and other encrusting organisms found on
the shell of Serpulorbis render it less recognizable (Harrold
1981), but this defensive response is not as effective as that of
mobile snails (such as Calliostoma or T. pulligo). Although these
sessile prey are not now as abundant as Petaloconchus was in 1981,
they are easily captured upon encounter. Thus, the increased
frequency of Balanus and <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Serpulorbis : PartialExact'>Serpulorbis may</span> reflect an adjustment to
replace Petaloconchus as a predictable energy source.
These results call for further study and more data. Since
the sample size of this study was small, the resolution of
abundance and dietary changes is fairly low. Small frequency
changes could not be detected, and some apparent changes may have
been partly due to sampling error. More feeding data could
correct any such effects and yield more conclusive results.
The role of the sessile polychaetes in Pisaster's diet should
be further explored. Although their increase in the sea star's
diet may be explained by an increase in abundance, more data may
indicate a more precise change which may also stem from the
absence of Petaloconchus. Another unresolved question is the role
of individual variation in the observed differences, as has been
displayed in other predators (West 1986, 1988).
Other methods of characterizing prey availability could be
explored, to see whether the results are comparable. Harrold
(1981) used two distinct methods of measuring abundance, numerical
abundance, counting the number of each species, and encounter
abundance, which factored in the length of each encounter with a
prey species. Encounter abundance would theoretically account for
effects of prey avoiding predation by living in different
microhabitats or other adaptations, which would render these prey
less available than their numerical abundance might suggest. This
method should differentiate between a choice made by a predator
and a simple inability to find and capture prey. However, this
method seems to undersample rare events, since the limitations of
SCUBA prevent long-term observation of sea stars.
Harrold (1981) notes that for many sessile species which do
not exhibit escape behaviors, numerical abundance is an adequate
measure of availability. He noted a small difference in
electivity indices of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Serpulorbis : PartialExact'>Serpulorbis based</span> on encounter abundance
rather than numerical abundance, but a smaller difference than for
mobile snails such as T. pulligo and Calliostoma. Thus, for the
species highlighted in my study (Balanus, Serpulorbis, and
Petaloconchus), numerical abundance should suffice. However,
using encounter abundance may show whether mobile species also
played a role in replacing Petaloconchus in the diet.
Menge (1972) defined prey availability as the ratio of
calories consumed from a certain prey to calories encountered.
However, since this uses the actual diet numbers, it includes
predator choice, making prey availability a function of the
predator, not simply the prey and environment, unless one assumes
that the diet follows actual availability. My study focused on
response to abundance changes, and caloric data were not
estimated, so this method was not used.
Given the time and methodological limitations of this study,
though, preliminary conclusions suggest that Pisaster giganteus
has compensated for the absence of Petaloconchus by feeding more
frequently on other sessile prey, keeping with the strategy of
maintaining a dependable energy source to offset the risk of not
capturing calorically more attractive prey. Further study should
support these findings.
