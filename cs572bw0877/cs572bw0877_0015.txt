ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank the Epel lab for all the time, patience, and
support given to me during my stay here at Hopkins Marine Station
during this past quarter. Thank-you, Dave, for all the time and
advice you gave me over the quarter. I really had fun and learned a
lot during lab meeting and lunches. Thank-you, Barbara, for sharing
with me your knowledge on Urechis, rhodamine assays, and Western
blots. Thank-you, Beth, for sharing your lab bench with me, and also
for your smiles in times of frustration. Thank-you, Paul, for sharing
your insights on how to do things easier such as skating in the mud.
Thank-you, Robin, for your help in the lab including showing me
where things were hiding. Thank-you, Francois, for your interests
and sense of humor in my project. Thank-you, Chris, for making us
laugh in frustrated times, developing wonderful pictures, and making
corny jokes about pre-meds. Thank-you, Molly, for being a great
T.A., developing great slides, and for being a all-around wonderful
person. Thank-you, Maria, for being my Urechis buddy and helping
to dig me out of the mud. Finally, thank-you, Annie and Jenny, for
being wonderful labmates as well as housemates and Esther, for
being a great housemate. Without you all, my quarter would have
been not the same.
