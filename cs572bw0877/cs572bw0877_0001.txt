ABSTRACT
The marine worm Urechis caupo exhibits a multixenobiotic
resistance (MXR) similar to multidrug resistance (MDR) in
mammalian tumor cells. Urechis oocytes from their developing
stages in the coelomic fluid to at least the two-day larval stage
possess a membranous protein of 160 kD that is immunologically
related to the mammalian MDR P-glycoprotein of 170 kD. However,
activity of the 160 kD protein is absent in developing coelomic
oocytes but is detected once the oocytes reach the storage organs as
immature oocytes. Further studies are necessary to investigate the
causes for the activity increase of the MXR protein at this stage.
INTRODUCTION
A major focus of current cancer research is on the multidrug
resistance phenomenon mediated by the multidrug transport protein
or P-glycoprotein. Different chemotherapeutic drugs similar only in
their moderate hydrophobicity are transported out by this protein,
rendering clinical chemotherapy virtually ineffective (West, 1990).
P-glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein with two ATP binding
sites (Chen et al., 1986; Gros et al., 1986). Hydrophobic compounds
including natural toxins and anti-cancer agents diffuse naturally into
the tumor cell, and P-glycoprotein then utilizes ATP to transport the
hydrophobic compounds out of the cell (Harper, 1993). This
multidrug resistance to a variety of drugs is also accompanied by a
decrease in the drug accumulation (Juliano, 1976) (Figure 1).
However, the MDR extrusion pump can be saturated and thus
inhibited by other MDR substrates such as verapamil. In this case,
the MDR transport pump becomes non-functional and
