showed the following + verapamil ratios, respectively: 2.1, .87, and
1.9, indicating MDR activity in the first and third trials (Figure 13).
Western blots were performed at the following stages of
Urechis caupo: coelomic, 2-day, and gastrulation. All three stages
showed a band at around 160 KD (Figure 14).
DISCUSSION
The + verapamil ratios of immature oocytes and also
the embryos at the 2-cell, 4-cell, gastrula, and 2-day stages suggest
that these cells possess MXR activity. Furthermore, the Western blot
analysis shows that gastrulae and 2-day old embryos possess a
protein of MW 160 kD that is labeled by a monoclonal antibody to
the conserved ATP-binding region of the mammalian P-glycoprotein.
These results indicate a multixenobiotic resistance mechanism
similar to the MDR resistance in mammals is present in Urechis early
embryos.
The control performed on immature oocytes with and without
formaldehyde indicates that formaldehyde does decrease rhodamine
considerably. Another way of immobilizing the later ciliated stages
of Urechis embryos should be found and used, preferably a way that
does not damage the embryo. Mireles has found methyl cellulose to
be an effective but harmless immobilizer for Urechis embryos
(Mireles, personal communication).
The rhodamine assays performed on the coelomic and
immature oocytes from the same female show the absence of MXR
activity in the coelomic oocytes but the presence of MXR activity in
