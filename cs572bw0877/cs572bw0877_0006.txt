lens of an epifluorescence microscope with filters for rhodamine and
the aperture was closed to a fixed point.
At the later stages of development (e.g. gastrulation and 2-day
larvae), 37% formaldehyde was used to immobilize the moving
embryos. Fluorescence measurements were taken on 10-20 healthy
oocytes or zygotes by a photosensor attached to the microscope. The
light emitted by each embryo was picked up by the photosensor and
converted to a numerical value by a voltmeter. In immature and
fertilized oocytes, mean values were calculated for each sample, and
ratios of the mean values of cells with and those without verapamil
were calculated as an index of MXR activity.
The second set of experiments involved performing rhodamine
fluorescence assays on coelomic and immature oocytes from the
same female Urechis. Oocytes of different sizes develop in the
coelomic fluid; the diameter of each coelomic oocyte was measured
with a reticule and the fluorescence was measured as above. One
unit on the reticule equaled 66.7 microns.
WESTERN BLOTS
Protein Sample Assays
Oocytes at various stages of development were washed, hand
centrifuged, and concentrated into about 100 ul in an eppendorf
tube. A minimum amount of lysis buffer (approximately 170 ul) was
added to the egg concentrate. The eggs were then homogenized into
a milky solution and were put on ice for a while. Approximate 100
ul of 5% SDS was added to the homogenate which was then sonicated
