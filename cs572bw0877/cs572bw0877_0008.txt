(Sigma) (1:1000 in PBS-Tween 20-BSA). It was then washed three
times for ten minutes each with 10 ml of PBS-Tween 20 (.05%) and
incubated in alkaline phosphatase developing buffer (100 mM Tris,
100 mM Nacl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 9.5 with nitro-blue tetrazolium and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate).
RESULTS
Rhodamine Fluorescence Assays
In the later developmental stages of Urechis caupo, the
embryos develop cilia and become motile. To stop motility, I found
that 37% formaldehyde immobilized the embryos, enabling a more
accurate fluorescence reading. A control was performed to test the
effects of formaldehyde on rhodamine fluorescence since
formaldehyde kills the cells. The control showed that formaldehyde
decreases rhodamine fluorescence by approximately 44% (Figure 4).
Rhodamine fluorescence assays showed that an MXR
mechanism is active in unfertilized eggs, two-cell and four-cell
embryos, gastrulae, and two-day larvaes since the + verapamil
ratio at each stage was 2.3 or greater. The average + verapamil
ratio was 2.3 at the unfertilized stage, 3.7 at the 2-cell stage, 2.7 at
the 4-cell stage, 3.3 at gastrulation, and 2.6 at the 2-day stage. The
+ verapamil ratios corrected for formaldehyde at gastrulation and
the 2-day stage were 6.3 and 4.9 (Figure 5).
Rhodamine fluorescence assays were performed on the
coelomic and immature oocytes of three different Urechis females at
