Inhibitors to the two kinases such as staurosporine and H-7,
respectively, decrease the drug efflux from the cell, whereas protein
kinase C activators such as phorbol esters increase drug efflux (Ma et
al., 1991; Miyamoto et al., 1990). To test if either kinase is involved
in the MXR activity increases between coelomic and immature
oocytes and/or immature and fertilized oocytes, further rhodamine
assays should be conducted using staurosporine and H-7 as inhibitors
at the more active stage.
Environmental conditions of the oocytes may also influence
their MXR activity. Coelomic, immature, and fertilized oocytes live in
different media in nature. Coelomic oocytes develop in the coelomic
fluid surrounded by erythrocytes and proteins. Immature oocytes
are collected from the coelomic fluid and stored in storing organs.
Finally, immature oocytes become fertilized in seawater where
sperm can swim to them. These environments are different in many
ways, one of which may be their pH. The coelomic oocytes may be
activated by a change in pH. Furthermore, the different
environmental conditions may serve as a trigger to phosphorylation.
Coelomic oocytes reside within their mother, sheltered from
any external hazards. Thus, the coelomic oocytes may not need yet
to exert a self-defense mechanism. They can use the mother's
defense mechanisms. In addition, the MXR protein binds to many
hydrophobic substrates and transports them out of the cells. While
still developing, the coelomic oocytes may need for certain
hydrophobic compounds to be retained in the cell. Thus, MXR
inactivity may be beneficial to the oocytes at their developing stages.
