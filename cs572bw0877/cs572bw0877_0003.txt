assayed by comparing the fluorescence of oocytes incubated in both
rhodamine and verapamil to those incubated in rhodamine alone
with a ratio of 2 to 8 usually indicating MXR activity. However, the
ratio range is not absolute due to variance among oocytes from
different female Urechis.
Immunoassays used to detect a protein immunologically
related to the mammalian P-glycoprotein include gel electrophoresis
and Western blotting, which probe protein samples with an antibody
to the mammalian MDR protein. R7 cells or other cell lines containing
the mammalian protein are used to insure validity of the antibody
probe and for comparison with the protein samples.
Recent studies have investigated the MXR mechanism in
mature oocytes and embryos of Urechis caupo without any specific
focus on the different stages of development. In my study, I
focused on investigating the presence and activity level of MXR from
the coelomic oocyte to the two-day larval stage using Western blots
and the rhodamine fluorescence assay. My results showed the
presence of a a protein immunologically related to the mammalian PÂ¬
glycoprotein in Urechis from coelomic oocytes through the two-day
larvae. However, MXR activity was absent in coelomic oocytes,
present only in the immature oocytes in the storage organs, in the
fertilized oocytes, and in the embryos. For clarification, developing
oocytes reside in the coelomic fluid, and immature oocytes are stored
in storage sacs. Oocytes reach maturity only when they have become
fertilized.
