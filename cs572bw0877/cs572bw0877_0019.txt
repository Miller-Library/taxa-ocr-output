Figure 10. Trial 1: Coelomic oocytes in 1 uM rhodamine B and 2.2
uM verapamil. No apparent trend between the +verapamil and
-verapamil graphs.
Figure 11. Trial 2: Coelomic oocytes in 1 uM rhodamine B and 2.2
uM verapamil. -Verapamil graph is higher than the +verapamil
graph at all diameter sizes of oocytes.
Figure 12. Trial 3: Coelomic oocytes in 1 uM rhodamine B and 2.2
uM verapamil. No apparent trend between the +verapamil and
-verapamil graphs.
Figure 13. + Verapamil ratios of immature oocytes Incubated in 1
uM rhodamine B and 2.2 uM verapamil. Trial 1 and trial 3 indicate
MDR activity with + verapamil ratios greater than 1.7.

Urechis caupo. A band at 160 kD is seen in coelomic oocytes,
gastrula, and 2-day larvae.
