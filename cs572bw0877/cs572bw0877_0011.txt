immature oocytes. In the first and third trials, assays with both .5
uM and 1.0 uM rhodamine B show no significant differences between
the +verapamil and -verapamil graphs of the coelomic oocytes.
These results indicate that verapamil does not inhibit the transport
function of the MXR protein because the protein in coelomic oocytes
is not yet active or simply not present. The rhodamine assays of the
immature oocytes in the first and third trials at both rhodamine
concentrations suggest MXR activity with + verapamil ratios of 1.7
or greater.
The second trial of coelomic oocytes did not give as clear
results as the first and third trials. At 5 uM rhodamine
concentration, the +verapamil graph was always above the
-verapamil graph. The + verapamil ratios between the two graphs
never exceeded 1.3. These results suggest some MXR activity in the
coelomic oocytes. One possible explanation for this is that this
particular worm may have been stressed, having some MXR activity
in its coelomic oocytes. In addition, + verapamil ratios from the
coelomic oocytes were not as valid as those from the immature and
fertilized oocytes because the +verapamil and -verapamil graphs
involved coelomic oocytes of different sizes. During each rhodamine
assay, finding coelomic oocytes of one particular size to measure
their fluorescence was difficult so the + verapamil and -verapamil
graphs did not always consist of the same-sized oocytes. Both
coelomic and immature oocytes were saturated at 1 uM rhodamine
but not at .5 uM rhodamine as indicated by the + verapamil ratio of
87 in the immature oocytes at 1 uM rhodamine and the +Â¬
verapamil ratio of 1.7 at 5 uM rhodamine. The former ratio is less
