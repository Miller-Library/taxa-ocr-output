than one, indicating that adding verapamil to 1 uM rhodamine made
no difference in fluorescence, although verapamil enhanced
fluorescence at 5 uM rhodamine. Therefore, the data from the
second trial at 1 uM rhodamine should be disregarded due to
oversaturation of the oocytes by rhodamine.
Western blot analysis also shows that a 160 kD protein is
present in coelomic oocytes. This result demonstrates the presence
of a protein immunologically related to the mammalian PÂ¬
glycoprotein. However, rhodamine fluorescence assays indicate a
lack of MXR activity in coelomic oocytes, suggesting that the MXR
protein is present but inactive in the coelomic oocytes. However, this
protein is present and active in immature and fertilized oocytes.
What then activates MXR in Urechis coelomic oocytes? One
possible explanation is that the oocytes in the coelomic fluid undergo
some kind of post-translational modification, specifically
phosphorylation, before becoming immature oocytes in the storage
organs. A past study has indicated approximately a 50% increase in
MXR activity between unfertilized and fertilized Urechis oocytes
2(Toomey, personal communication). This increase in MXR activity at
fertilization and the increase between coelomic and immature
oocytes may be due to phosphorylation. Center showed that the
mammalian P-glycoprotein transporting function can be modified by
phosphorylation. An increase in P-glycoprotein phosphorylation
produces a decrease in drug accumulation and an increased
resistance to the drugs (Center, 1985). Both protein kinase C and
cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyze phosphorylation in MDR
cells (Chambers et al., 1990; Ma et al., 1991; Miyamoto et al., 1990).
