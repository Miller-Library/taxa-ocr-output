chemotherapeutic drugs and other hydrophobic compounds enter the
tumor cell and effectively destroy it.
A similar phenomenon to MDR is seen in some aquatic animals
including mussels, sponges, fishes, and worms. In these animals, a
multixenobiotic transport protein is as a possible defense mechanism
against natural and man-made xenobiotics. Studies on the echiuroid
worm Urechis caupo show that a protein immunologically and
functionally related to the mammalian MDR protein is present in its
oocytes and embryos.
Urechis caupo live in polluted mudflats where they inhabit UÂ¬
shaped burrows. They circulate water and oxygen through the
tunnel by rhythmic peristalsis of their bodies, and feed by secreting
a mucous net to trap small food particles. Gametes continuously
develop in the coelomic fluid (Morris, Abbott, Haderlie, 1980). After
reaching a certain stage of development, they are then sequestered
by collecting organs and stored in three pairs of storage organs near
the anterior region (Figure 2).
A multixenobiotic resistance mechanism has been discovered in
Urechis caupo using fluorescence assays and immunoassays
(Toomey, 1993). The fluorescence assay measures the accumulation
of the dye rhodamine B, which is a substrate for the transport
protein (Neyfakh, 1988). Embryos or oocytes are incubated in
rhodamine B with and without verapamil, a potent competitive
substrate of the MDR protein. Oocytes in rhodamine have a lower
fluorescence than oocytes in rhodamine plus verapamil. Since
verapamil competes with rhodamine for export; less rhodamine
efflux occurs and the cells fluoresce more. MXR activity is thus
