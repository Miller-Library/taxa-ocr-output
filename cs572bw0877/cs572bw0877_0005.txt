EXTRACTIONOE COELOMICOOCYIES
Oocytes are continuously developing in the coelomic fluid of
female Urechis (Miller, 1973). The coelomic fluid was extracted by
puncturing the body wall near the posterior end with a needle and
squeezing the fluid out into a small beaker. The fluid was then
centrifuged in a swinging-bucket rotor for two minutes in an
international clinical centrifuge at 1500 g (Gould, 1967). The
developing oocytes form a light brown layer above the coelomocytes
and were selectively removed with a pipette. This centrifugation
step was repeated several more times to further purify the oocytes.
RHODAMINE ELUORESCENCE ASSAY
For each rhodamine assay,
a 10 ml egg suspension was first
obtained and then divided evenly into two 5 ml egg suspensions of
approximately equal concentrations. To each egg suspension, 5 ul of
either 1 mM or 5 mM rhodamine B were added for a final
To
rhodamine B concentration of either 1 uM or 5 uM, respectively.
one of each pair of egg suspensions 25 ul of either 2 mg/ml or .2
mg/ml verapamil were added, depending on the desired final
concentration of either 22 uM or 2.2uM verapamil. After the
samples were incubated for, one hour at 17Â°C, they were spun in a
hand centrifuge, the rhodamine supernatant was suctioned off with
an aspirator, and the eggs were resuspended in 1 ml of filtered
seawater. The egg cells were immediately positioned under a l6X
