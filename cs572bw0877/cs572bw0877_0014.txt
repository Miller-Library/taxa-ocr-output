Discovering why MXR activity is turned on as Urechis caupo
oocytes mature can prove helpful in further understanding both MXR
activity against pollutants in aquatic animals and MDR activity
against anti-cancer drugs in tumor cells. If MDR activity can be
turned off in tumor cells as it is in Urechis coelomic oocytes, then
chemotherapy would become much more effective.
In addition, further research on MXR may provide insight on
its natural role in the cell. The transport function of the MXR protein
is inherent in many marine organism, not requiring induction by
pollutants or drugs(Kurelec, 1992). Also, the MXR protein exists and
is taxonomically highly conserved across many species (Kurelec,
1992). This information implies that this mechanism has a role(s)
that is important in the functioning of certain cells. One possible role
may be to excrete natural toxic products in the diet or endogenous
metabolites (Gottesman, 1988).
Another role of P-glycoprotein in
mammals may be to secrete progesterone and other steroids in
mammalian adrenal cortex (Qian, 1990). Regardless of other possible
roles, the MXR mechanism plays an important role in detoxifying
cells in marine and terrestrial life.
