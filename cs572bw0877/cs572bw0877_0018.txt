Figure 1. Mechanism of P-glycoprotein transport function.
Moderately hydrophobic compounds diffuse into the cell. PÂ¬
glycoprotein binds to the compounds and transports them out using
ATP as its energy source.
Figure 2. Anatomy of Urechis caupo. Immature gametes are stored
in the storage organs ready to be spawned, and developing gametes
are in the coelomic fluid. Oocytes do not reach full maturity until
they are fertilized when they finish meiosis II.
Figure 3. Spawning of Urechis caupo. A glass probe is inserted and
gently rotated into one of six gonadopores. Extrusion of sperm
(white) and eggs (pink, yellow, olive) follows.
Figure 4. Effects of formaldehyde on rhodamine B fluorescence in
U. caupo oocytes. Formaldehyde decreases rhodamine fluorescence
by 44%.
Figure 5. + Verapamil ratios of U. caupo oocytes at different
stages incubated in 1 uM rhodamine B and 22 uM verapamil. Ratios
corrected for formaldehyde are also shown.
Figure 6. Trial 1: Coelomic oocytes in 5 uM rhodamine B and 2.2
uM verapamil. No apparent trend between +verapamil and
-verapamil graphs.
Figure 7. Trial 2: Coelomic Oocytes in 5 uM rhodamine B and 2.2
uM verapamil. +Verapamil graph is higher than -verapamil graph at
all diameter sizes of oocytes.
Figure 8. Trial 3: Coelomic oocytes in 5 uM rhodamine B and 2.2
uM verapamil. No apparent trend between the +verapamil and
-verapamil graphs.
Figure 9. + Verapamil ratio of immature oocytes incubated in .5
uM rhodamine B and 2.2 uM verapamil. Both trial 2 and trial 3
indicate MXR activity with + verapamil ratios of greater than 1.7
