two rhodamine concentrations, 5 uM and 1.0 uM and at 2.2 uM
verapamil. At .5 uM rhodamine B, the first trial had coelomic oocyte
diameters ranging from 33 to 127 microns. No apparent trend was
observed between the +verapamil and -verapamil graphs, which
overlapped at two points (Figure 6). The second trial at 5 uM
rhodamine involved coelomic oocytes with diameters ranging from
47 to 140 microns. The +verapamil graph was slightly higher in
fluorescence than the -verapamil graph at all diameter sizes (Figure
7). The third trial at 5 uM rhodamine included coelomic oocyte
diameters ranging from 47 to 120 microns. This trial also showed no
apparent pattern between the +verapamil and -verapamil graphs,
which overlapped at four places (Figure 8). The immature oocytes
incubated at 5 uM rhodamine from the second and third female
exhibit MDR activity with + verapamil ratios of 1.7 and 1.9,
respectively (Figure 9).
At 1 uM rhodamine concentration, the coelomic oocytes from
the first trial ranged in diameter size from 60 to 134 microns. No
trend was observed between the +verapamil and -verapamil graphs,
which overlapped in three places (Figure 10). For trial 2 at 1 uM
rhodamine, the coelomic oocyte diameters ranged from 40 to 134
microns. The -verapamil graph is slightly higher in rhodamine
fluorescence than the +verapamil graph for all oocyte diameters
(Figure 11). Finally, the coelomic oocytes in the third trial at 1 uM
rhodamine have diameters ranging from 33 to 127 microns. No
apparent trend was seen between the +verapamil and - verapamil
graphs, which overlapped in five places (Figure 12). The immature
oocytes from the three female Urechis incubated in 1 uM rhodamine
