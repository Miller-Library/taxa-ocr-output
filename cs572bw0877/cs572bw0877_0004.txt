MATERIALS AND METHODS
COLLECTION AND MAINTENANCE
Adult Urechis caupo were collected at Elkhorn Slough near
Moss Landing, California. They were maintained in tanks with
running seawater and a layer of mud from the slough.
SPAWNING
Immature gametes were obtained by inserting a rounded
smooth-tipped glass pipette into one of six gonadopores and gently
rotating the pipette back and forth (Figure 3). Either sperm (white)
or oocytes (pink, yellow, or olive) gushed from the gonadopore. The
sperm was pipetted in its concentrated form into an eppendorf tube
and stored in a refrigerator, able to retain its viability for 3-5 days.
The oocytes were rinsed off the animal into a beaker with filtered
seawater. They were stored at 17Â°C until use, and fresh oocytes
were obtained every day.
FERTILIZATION
Urechis oocytes were fertilized by adding a drop of dilute
sperm into a beaker of oocytes in filtered seawater. After a few
minutes, the excess sperm were washed out by hand centrifugation
and suctioning off the supernatant with an aspirator. The fertilized
oocytes were then resuspended in fresh, filtered seawater.
