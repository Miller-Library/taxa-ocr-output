ten times for 3 seconds each. Protein concentrations of each sample
were obtained using the BCA protein assay(Pierce). A standard
curve using bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted with 5% SDS was
constructed using the following concentrations of BSA: 0 mg/ml, 0.1
mg/ml, 0.25 mg/ml, 0.50 mg/ml, and 1.00 mg/ml. 5 ul samples of
each sample and dilutions of the egg samples were placed in
triplicate in a 96 well micro-titer. 100 ul of BCA working reagent
was then added to each well, and the samples were incubated at
60Â°C for 30 minutes. The protein concentrations of the unknown
samples were determined using a Molecular Devices VMax plate
reader at 550 nm. Each egg sample was mixed with an equal amount
of sample buffer and boiled for five minutes in a water bath. The
samples were then stored in a freezer at -200C.
Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting
Samples were loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel at
approximately 40 ug of protein per lane. The proteins were
separated on a BioRad minigel apparatus using a tris/glycine running
buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a BioRad
electrophoretic transfer system. The proteins were transferred at 13
V for 1 hour, 24 V for 2 hours, and 36 V overnight. The blots were
blocked with PBS-Tween 20 (.05%)-BSA(lOmM) for 30 minutes and
then incubated for 2 hours with C219 monoclonal antibody
(Centocor) (1:250 in PBS-Tween 20-BSA,). The nitrocellulose
membrane was washed for 10 minutes with 10 mls of the PBS-
Tween20-PBS blocking solution three times and then incubated for 1
hour with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase
