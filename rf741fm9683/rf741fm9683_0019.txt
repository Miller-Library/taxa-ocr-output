Future studies to discover more about the effects of captivity on the activity of
yellowfin tuna will be important to understanding the tuna response and optimizing
captive conditions to best maintain tuna in captivity. A closer look at tailbeat frequency
and amplitude may reveal interesting patterns and may show how tuna use their muscle in
Ã  more quantitative fashion. It would be interesting to continue speed observations
throughout the year to investigate the possibility of seasonal variation, as well as to
observe speed at different water temperatures to ascertain the magnitude of temperature
effects. The TRCC fish do occasionally sprint around the tank, and their maximum speed
is not known nor is the frequency of this behavior.
