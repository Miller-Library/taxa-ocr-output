Calculations show that the average tuna in TI travels: 75, 322.29 body
lengths/day, 83.61 km/day, 51.95 mi/day, or approximately 3,300 laps/day. Scarface
travels: 74, 594.13 body lengths/day, 82.80 km/day, 51.45 mi/day, or approximately
3,300 laps/ day
B. T3
An average individual in T3 travels: 103,507.2 body lengths/day, 75.82 km/day,
or 47.11 mi/day.
Tailbeats
Tailbeats/sec through the 3m distance sampled when the tuna are travelling with
the current (w/c) and against the current (a/c) are displayed as a frequency histogram in
Figures 5. With the current, the tailbeat frequency median was 1.25, mean was 1.17 and
standard deviation was 0.46. Against the current, the median was 1.34, mean was 1.28,
and standard deviation was 0.36. A Two Tail Two Sample t-Test assuming equal
variance conducted on these two samples, with an n of 1718 and 2196 individual
observations respectively, revealed that the means are significantly different with a p-
value of 2.2 E-16. This p-value is extremely small for means that differ only by 0.11,
but the n'is large. A two tail F-test was also conducted to insure that the assumption that
the variances were equal was valid and yielded a p-value of 9.03E-30.
Histology
A. Cytochrome Oxidase
High levels of cytochrome oxidase activity are typically found in red aerobic
muscle. Figure 6 shows red muscle from quarantine yellowfin tuna. Staining indicates
