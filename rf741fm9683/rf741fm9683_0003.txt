(Lehninger, 1982). Myosin ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to
adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, thereby providing the energy necessary
to initiate muscular contraction. The speed of muscle shortening is directly proportional
to the myosin ATPase activity present, which implies that the speed of contraction may
be determined from the level of ATPase activity. However, there are several examples in
which the biochemical and physiological properties of the muscle are not accurately
reflected by myosin ATPase activities, such as in the muscles of newborn animals which
stain intensely for ATPase although their ATPase activity is very low and their
contraction speed is slow. It is not possible to determine the locality of enzyme activity
in a cell from the distribution of the reaction product because inorganic phosphate
liberated in mitochondrial, myofibrillar, or sarcotubular ATPase activity selectively binds
to myofibrils (Guth, 1973). In addition, the intensity of ATPase staining does not
necessitate the level of enzyme activity due to differential inorganic phosphate binding
among various muscle fiber types (Guth, 1973). Assays for myosin ATPase activity
involve treating tissues with acidic or alkali buffers to destroy certain myosin ATPase
isoforms. Differential staining between similar tissues subjected to the same treatment
may indicate that there is a difference in the isoforms expressed in the given tissues
