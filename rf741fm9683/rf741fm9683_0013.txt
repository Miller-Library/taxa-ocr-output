approximately 13 hours of the day with and 11 hours of the day against the current, and
most of the hours spent against the current occurred at night between the hours of 22:00
and 7:00. It is not known if this pattern is constant from day to day. At night, the
average radius swam and lap time decreased substantially as the tuna moved closer to the
center of the tank when the main lights in the TRCC were turned off. Since night time
speed calculations were essentially the same as day time calculations, it appears that these
effects offset one another. Speed varied insignificantly with time of day. One light
directly above the center of the tank remains on at night. When swimming against the
current, the schooling behavior, prominent when the tuna travel with the current,
deteriorated somewhat as the school became less dense, and more individual behavior
could be observed. The tendency for the tuna to spend a majority of their time travelling
through the vortex in the center of the tank was the most typical behavior observed.
B.
T3
The tuna in 13 most often swam inconsistent laps, regardless of their orientation
to the current, and seemed to spend an equal amount of time travelling through the vortex
in each direction. They also spent approximately equal amounts of time travelling with
and against the current and would switch directions with a frequency of about once per
hour, although they could switch directions as frequently as once every 2 minutes when
disturbed by activity in the TRCC such as prefeeding routines. The night time
phenomenon of moving toward the center mentioned above in TI was also displayed to a
lesser extent in T3.
