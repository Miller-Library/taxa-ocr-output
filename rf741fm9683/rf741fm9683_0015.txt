time, are presented as a summary of published yellowfin tuna mean swimming speeds in
Table 4. These data for wild tuna present obvious problems in a direct comparison, the
difference in size of the tuna body length between the wild and captive fish the most
problematic since absolute speed in body lengths/sec decreases with an increase in size
(Wu, Theodore Y. and Yates George T., 1978). Therefore, the disparity between captive
and wild speed values could potentially result from several parameters. In addition to
difference in body lengths, the tracking data may lack accuracy due to the fact that the
vertical component of three-dimensional distance travelled is not taken into account. The
difference in ambient temperature of the captive tuna and wild tuna may have slowed the
metabolic rate of the captive tuna, thus lowering its respiration requirements for oxygen
and thereby lowering the speed the tuna must maintain to obtain the necessary oxygen.
And, finally, the tank size may be limiting their cruising behavior by confining them to a
speed slower than would be observed in the wild.
The distance travelled by the four tuna tracked by Carey and Olsen in the wild is
also very comparable to that travelled in captivity. The tuna of fork length 0.96, and 0.98
m travelled average distances of 3.4 and 2.4 km in an hour respectively, whereas the TI
tuna travelled an average of 3.48 km/hour. The tuna of fork length 0.89 and 0.87 m
travelled 5.9, 3.5 km in an hour respectively, while the T3 tuna travelled an average of
3.45 km/hour.
Throughout a 24 hour period, no significant difference in swimming speed could
be delineated. This lack of fluctuation indicates that their speed is relatively constant
throughout the day and is not affected by natural light/dark cycles. Similarly, no
