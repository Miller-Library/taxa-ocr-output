days of night time hours. TI school observations were logged for all hours of the day
that they were swimming with the current. Scarface observations were logged
concurrently, with the exception of hours 00:00-6:00 and 20:00-00:00 when the dimmed
lighting in the TRCC made it extremely difficult to identify an individual. When the
school was swimming against the current, Scarface data was also a challenge to obtain
due to the tendency of the tuna to swim inconsistent laps. Nevertheless, a few
observations were successfully logged and were pooled from limited times of the day,
then extrapolated to account for any hour of the day in which Scarface was swimming
against the current.
B.
T3
The tuna in T3 swam with the current and against the current for approximately
equal amounts of time throughout the day as determined from 5-10 separate day time and
1-2 separate night time observation days. Data was collected for swimming across a
distance of 3 m distance during all hours of the day.
Speeds were calculated in m/s and body lengths/s (1s). Speed (1/s) as a function
of time of day is shown in Figure 3. Average speed (m/s) and average speed (1/s) is
shown in Table 2. A t-Test was run with an alpha of 5% to determine the significance or
lack thereof between the mean speeds (1/s) calculated, the resultsof which are displayed in
Table 3. The mean swimming speed (Is) of TI and T3 were found to be significantly
different. See Figure 4.
