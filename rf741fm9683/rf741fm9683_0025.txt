Fig. 1. The average water velocity (m/s) as a function of horizontal position in TI.
Fig. 2. The water velocity (m/s) at depths of 0.61 and 1.54 m as a function of horizontal
position in T3.
Fig. 3. TI school, TI Scarface with current (w/c), TI Scarface against current (a/c), T3
school w/c, and T3 school a/c tuna speed (I/s) as a function of time of day. Where
standard error bars cannot be seen, they are smaller than the marker symbols. Represents
a total of 1,905 individual TI lap observations, and 3,914 T3 timed observations.
Fig. 4. Mean swimming speed (1/s) as a function of tank.
Fig. 5. T3 tailbeat frequency histogram with current (w/c) and against current (a/c).
