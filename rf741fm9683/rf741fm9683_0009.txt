minutes and in alkali treatments for 10 minutes. Longer preincubation times were
adapted into the Guth and Samaha procedure. The slides were then washed in 100 mM
Tris/19 mM CaCl, for 10 seconds and placed in the ATPase reaction medium. The acid
and alkali tissues were incubated with agitation in this medium for 60 and 30 minutes at
room temperature respectively, and the no-preincubation tissues were incubated with the
alkali solution. Following incubation, the slides were washed in 200 mM Cacl, 3 times
30 seconds each. The slides were then soaked in 2% CoCl, for 1.5 minutes and washed
in 100mM Tris, pH 9.4 3 times, 30 seconds each. The slides were soaked in 1%
ammonium sulfide for 1 minute and washed in dH,0 3 times, 30 seconds each. Lastly,
the slides were dehydrated in an ethanol series and coverslipped in Permount.
Results
Water Velocity
The water velocity measurements for TI and T3 are displayed in Table 1. The
average of the velocities at a given distance horizontally across TI are shown in Figure 1.
Since the measurements showed that the water velocity in the tank is symmetrical,
measurements were taken in half of T3. The velocities measured in T3 as a function of
depth and horizontal distance from the edge of the tank are shown in Figure 2.
Speed
A.
The tuna school in TI swam with the current for approximately 13 hours of the
day and against the current for approximately 11 hours of the day, as determined from
approximately 5-10 separate observation days of most day time hours and 1-2 observation
