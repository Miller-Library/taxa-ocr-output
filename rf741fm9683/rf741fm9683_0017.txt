oxidase reactions have taken place. The quarantine and TRCC white muscle do not
contain any similar structures and overall staining is lighter, indicating fewer
mitochondria and less cytochrome oxidase activity than that of the wild tuna. One could
conclude from this result that the wild tuna has a higher level of this enzyme activity,
possibly due to a higher aerobic capacity of its white muscle, and therefore the wild tuna
most likely uses its white muscle more than do the captive tuna.
No obvious difference could be seen in the staining of the red muscle tissue
between the wild and captive tuna. Since the red muscle is used for slow, aerobic
swimming activity, perhaps, as is suggested by the similar TRCC and wild tuna cruising
speeds, that this muscle is used in an equivalent capacity in both populations.
Myosin ATPase
The myosin ATPase assay was conducted at several pHs, all of which had a
considerable amount of staining. A substantial difference in staining between similar
tissues of different tuna was detected at low pHs. At pH 4.5, wild tuna aerobic red
muscle stains lighter than that of the captive quarantine or TRCC aerobic red muscle.
Similarly, the anaerobic white muscle tissue of the wild tuna also stains lighter than that
of the captive quarantine and TRCC tuna. These results indicate that different isoforms
of myosin ATPase are being expressed in the wild and captive tuna, and that the isoform
expressed in the wild tuna tissue is sensitive to low pH, the most sensitive at pH 4.5 for
red tissue and pH 4.0 for white tissue.
