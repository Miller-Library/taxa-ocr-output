T3 has a 1 mâ€™ grid across the entire bottom surface of the tank and TI has a similar grid
only at the outer edge of the tank.
The tuna in TI were between 2 and 3 years old, have been in captivity for 1.7
years, and are approximately 1.11 m long. The tuna in T3 are between 1 and 2 years old,
have been in captivity for 9 months, and are approximately 0.7325 m long.

An easily identifiable individual with a large scar on the right side of its face
(Scarface) was chosen from the school for observation.
When swimming with the current, the tuna in TI swim laps consistently. A pole
marked in O.Im increments was extended over the tank from its edge so that the position
of Scarface relative to the edge of the tank could be measured for each lap. Observations
were made from the catwalk above the tank. Positions at the beginning and end of each
lap were measured and averaged. This mean was subtracted from the tank radius, 6.096
m (20 ft), to obtain the average radius swam. The average radius that the school swam
was determined by measuring the position relative to the edge of the tank of the
innermost and outermost fish of the school at the beginning and end of each lap. The
average position of the school was calculated separately for the beginning and end of
each lap, and these calculations were averaged to determine the mean lap position, which
was subtracted from the tank radius to determine the average school radius swam. Lap
distance was calculated from lap radius using the equation: lap distance-2rr.
