This method was also used to observe Scarface when the tuna were swimming
against the current. It was impossible to collect accurate school data against the current
due to a lack in quantifiable school behavior. When swimming against the current, the
tuna display a preference to swim through the vortex in the center of the tank rather than
swim in laps.
Lap time was measured for both Scarface and the school with the current and for
Scarface against the current with a stopwatch. Lap time began and ended when
Scarfaceâ€™s rostrum passed under the pole and began and ended when the nose of the first
tuna in the school passed under the pole. Consecutive laps were timed for observation
periods ranging from 8 to 50 minutes in length. Lap observations were collected at all
hours of the day and night, though not in a consecutive 24 hour period.
Lap speed relative to the tank was calculated by dividing lap distance by lap time.
The speed relative to the water could then be calculated by subtracting the average water
velocity for observations taken when the tuna were travelling with the current and adding
the water velocity for observations against the current. Dividing this absolute speed by
the average body length (1.11 m) of the tuna yielded a speed calculation in body
lengths/sec (1/s).
B. T3
Because preliminary observations of tuna behavior in T3 indicated that they do
not consistently swim laps, it was necessary to quantify speed by a means other than lap
radius and lap time. The grid on the bottom of the tank was used to observe from the
catwalk above the tank the time required for a tuna to pass straight through a 3 m path
