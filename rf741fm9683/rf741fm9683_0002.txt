involves the red, or slow oxidative muscle. Wild tuna also consistently use their white, or
fast glycolytic, muscle to sprint for the purpose of catching prey and avoiding predators.
The ambient temperature of yellowfin tuna’s natural habitat ranges from 18-28°C.
Tracking studies indicate that they have a thermal preference for water temperatures
greater than 23°C (Holland, et al.).
Tuna kept in captivity at the TRCC are not only subjected to a limited tank size,
but are also hand fed frozen food and have no predators. The limitations imposed by
captive conditions may affect both aerobic and anaerobic swimming activity. In addition
the water temperature has been maintained at 20°C, a temperature that they would
experience in their natural habitat annually. Ambient temperature may also have an
affect on tuna activity.
Autopsies of tuna mortalities from the TRCC taken in March 1995 indicate that
they may be living the lifestyle of a "couch potato", eating too much and exercising too
little, as is evidenced by acumulation of lipid in their muscle. Histochemical assays were
used to test for differences between the muscle fiber types found in wild and captive tuna.
Captive tuna muscle tissue samples were taken from TRCC tuna kept in captivity for 9
months and a second population of tuna kept in the quarantine for 13 months. Muscle
fibers with a higher aerobic capacity contain more mitochondria and thus stain darker
when stained for cytochrome oxidase activity. Cytochrome oxidase catalyzes the transfer
of electrons to oxygen, the final electron acceptor in the electron transport and oxidative
phosphorylation chain of aerobic respiration. This process takes place in the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is the major source of ATP production in aerobic tissues
