The speed and activity level of the tuna was fairly constant throughout all hours of
the day, a result that is interesting in light of the fact that the tuna alternate direction.
especially since they must work harder to travel against the current. This phenomenon
could be due to simply a desire for variety, fun, or entertainment. Their tendency to
travel through the vortex may be for the same reason. TI tuna were more consistent in
their school and lap behavior than T3 tuna, and possible reasons for this difference in
behavior may lie in the fact that the TI fish are older and have been in captivity longer
than 13 fish, and therefore the TI tuna are more calm and more experienced with school
â€œetiquette". The difference may also be due to the difference in tank size and/or the
difference in water velocity.
Their tendency to swim near the center of the tank at night may be due to an
attraction to the light.
The reason for the side-swimming behavior is unknown, but, since it appears to be
an interactive display, it may be a communicative behavior, possibly related to courtship
or mating.
Conclusions
Together, the lower average speed of the captive tuna, the lighter cytochrome
oxidase staining of the captive tuna, and the differential myosin ATPase staining of the
captive tuna relative to the wild tuna indicate that captivity does have an effect on
yellowfin tuna activity, resulting in a change in properties of muscle aerobic enzymes and
force generation.
