approximately 1.85 m (6 ft) from the edge. A 3 m distance was chosen because it was a
distance through which the tuna would often swim straight and observation was more
accurate than for a larger distance due to less diffractional distortion. The tuna in T3
were all approximately the same length, so observations were taken of any member of the
tank, save one which was obviously larger than the others. Time was taken with a stop
watch and began when the rostrum of an individual crossed a grid line and ended when
the rostrum of the same individual crossed a grid line 3m from the start position.
Observations were recorded only if the tuna travelled the 3 m in a straight line. Speed
relative to the tank was calculated by dividing 3m by the time required to travel 3m.
Speed relative to the water was found by subtracting (0.112 m/s), the velocity of the
water at 1.85 m (6 ft) from the edge, when the observations were taken travelling with the
current, and adding 0.112 m/s when the observations were taken against the current.
Dividing this absolute speed by the average body length (0.7325 m) of the tuna yielded a
speed calculation in body lengths/sec. The tuna were observed at all hours of the day and
night, though not in a consecutive 24 hour period.
Distance
The average speed (Is) throughout the day was calculated and multiplied by the
number of seconds in a day (24 hrs/day*60 min/hr'60sec/min) to yield the distance (1)
travelled in a day.
Tailbeats
Tailbeat frequency was determined in T3 by counting the number of times the
tuna beat its tail as it passed through 3m concurrent with the time/3m observations. A
