significant difference in against the current and with the current swimming speed relative
to the water was found, implying that the tuna velocity may be dictated by the amount of
water they pass through or that passes over their gills rather than actual distance swam.
Tailbeats
However, the overall level of activity of the tuna is dependent on whether it is
swimming with or against the current, as is indicated by the significantly greater tailbeat
frequency through a distance of 3 m when travelling against the current. Tailbeat
frequency typically increases with velocity (Hunter and Zweifel, 1971), but in the case of
the TRCC tuna, the velocity against the current is essentially the same as that with the
current, yet their tailbeat frequency increases against the current. The tailbeat frequency
of a 0.53 m long wild yellowfin tuna travelling at 1.2 Us (0.636 m/s) was determined in a
large water tunnel to be 2.25 tailbeats/sec, whereas the median for the 0.7325 m long
TRCC tuna was 1.25 tailbeats/s with and 1.34 tailbeats/s against the current (Dewar and
Graham, 1994). This difference indicates that the TRCC tuna are less active than wild
tuna. However, this difference may also be due to a difference in fish size.
Histology
The assay for cytochrome oxidase activity in wild and captive muscle tissue was
used as an index of the aerobic activity of the muscle. It was expected that white muscle
would stain lighter than red muscle due to the lower cytochrome oxidase activity. It is
clear that there is a difference in the level of staining of the white muscle tissue between
the wild tuna and the quarantine and TRCC captive tuna. Small red dots in the cells of
the wild tuna white muscle most likely represent mitochondria in which cytochrome
