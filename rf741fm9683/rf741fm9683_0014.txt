The tuna in both tanks would occasionally display burst swimming behavior in
which they sprinted around the tank at a speed that appeared to be at least 3 times that of
sustained swimming speeds. Often, burst swimming would be accompanied by a side¬
swimming display in which the tuna would swim on its side for a length of time up to
approximately 8 seconds. The individual side-swimming usually, but not always, began
the behavior by following directly behind another tuna within a proximity of just a few
centimeters.

Speed
The calculated speeds of 0.91 1/s of TI tuna (§ 1.11 m length) and 1.19 1s of T3
tuna (20.7325 m length) were found to be significantly different from one another. This
phenomenon may result from the fact that the tuna are much larger, due to age, in TI than
in 13, and it has been shown that speed decreases as size increases (Wu, Theodore Y. and
Yates, George T., 1978). The different speed may also be due in part to the lack of the
3rd dimension of speed, the height in the water column, which was not taken into account
in this study. TI is 1.67 times deeper than T3, and it is possible that this parameter is
important when calculating tuna speed and distance swam. The TI tuna mean speed value
falls within the range of 0.68-0.98 1/s observed through tracking for yellowfin tuna of
similar size in the wild (0.96m and 0.98 m in length) (Carey and Olson, 1982). Similarly.
the T3 mean speed value also falls within the range of 1.19-1.28 1/s observed through
tracking wild tuna of similar size (0.7225-0.745 m in length) (Holland et al., 1990).
These, as well as data collected of wild tuna held in captivity for a minimum period of
