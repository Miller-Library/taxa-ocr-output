the presence of cytochrome oxidase activity in the mitochondria of the wild tuna white
anaerobic muscle tissue; see Figure 7. The red staining in the quarantine tuna tissue and
TRCC tuna tissue is indicative of cytochrome oxidase activity and is shown in Figures 8
and 9 respectively. The overall staining intensity is lighter in the captive white muscle
tissues. Since the assays were run simultaneously with the tissues treated on the same
slide, this result could not be due to any procedural differences.
B. Myosin ATPase
Staining was present in all of the pHs assayed, however differences in staining
intensity between tissues were most prominent at pH 4.0 and pH 4.5. The brown staining
present at pH 4.0 in wild tuna white muscle, quarantine tuna white muscle, and TRCC
tuna muscle tissue indicates the presence of myosin ATPase and can be seen in Figures
10, 11, and 12 respectively. Similarly, the brown staining present at pH 4.5 in wild tuna
red muscle, quarantine tuna red muscle, and TRCC tuna red muscle tissue also indicates
the presence of myosin ATPase and can be seen in Figures 13, 14, and 15 respectively.
In both cases, the wild tuna muscle tissue stains considerably lighter than both the
quarantine and TRCC tuna muscle tissue. Again, the assays were run simultaneously
with the tissues treated on the same slide.
Behavior
A.
TI
The tuna in TI displayed schooling behavior when swimming with the current.
The position of any individual in the school changed continuously from the inside to the
outside and front to back of the pack with seemingly no prescribed pattern. They spent
