Abstract
The activity of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares in captivity was assayed
through observations of speed, distance travelled in a day, and tailbeat. Cytochrome
oxidase and myosin ATPase assays were conducted on red and white muscle tissues from
wild and captive yellowfin tuna to determine a relative level of these enzyme activities.
The speeds calculated for the captive tuna were found to be significantly less than speeds
found by tracking wild tuna, indicating that captivity may be reducing tuna activity. In
addition, the enzyme assays revealed that cytochrome oxidase activity in captive white
muscle tissue appears to be distinctly different than that in wild white muscle tissue, and
different isoforms of myosin ATPase may be expressed in captive red and white muscle
tissues than those in wild red and white muscle tissues.
Introduction
Yellowfin tuna have been maintained in captivity for 1.7 years at the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center (TRCC) at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University in Pacific Grove, CA. Three sudden deaths due to heart attack in March 1995
of these tuna prompted an investigation of the cause. Were the tuna exercising enough?
How had captivity affected their activity? Was their activity less than that of wild tuna?
The goal of this study was to quantify tuna swimming activity and compare it to the
available data on wild tuna swimming behavior.
Because tuna are ram ventilators, they must constantly swim to maintain a
continuous flow of oxygen over their gills. In the wild, their "tank" is the vast Pacific
Ocean, so tunas naturally have essentially no limitations on this swimming activity which
