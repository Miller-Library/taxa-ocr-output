aerated seawater pH 7.9 kept at 20.5°C + 1 °C (70'F). Two pumps recirculate water into
the tank at 2271.18 L per minute (600 gpm) each and make-up water is pumped in at
302.8 L per minute (80 gpm) for a 74 minute turnover rate. Tank 3 (T3) is 9.252 m (30
ft) in diameter, 1.8054 m (6 ft) deep, and holds 109,773.7 L (29,000 gal) of seawater kept
at 20.5°C + 1 °C (70’F). 1514.12 L per minute (400 gpm) of recirculated water and
75.706 L per minute (20 gpm) of make-up water is pumped into T3 for a 74 minute
turnover rate. The water is pumped in at the surface edge and removed from a large drain
in the bottom center of the tank as well as from two small overflow drains at the surface
edge of each tank. This method of water recirculation creates a current in each tank with
a vortex in the center.
The velocity of the water in the tank was measured in each tank with a Marsh-
McBirney Model 511 electromagnetic velocity meter that ascertained the ion flow
(cm/sec) that passed a probe along x and y axes from which vector calculations could be
made. TI water velocity measurements were taken at 0.61m (2 ft), 1.65m (5.4 ft), 2.29m
(7.5 ft), 2.68m (8.8 ft), 3.6m (11.8 ft), 4.45m(14.6 ft), and 5.43m (17.8 ft) horizontally
from the edge of the tank at depths of 0.62m (2ft), 0.93m (3 ft), 1.54m (5 ft), 2.16m (7 ft),
and 2.78m (9 ft). T3 water velocity measurements were taken at 0.73 m (2.36 ft), 1.83 m
(5.93 ft), 3.08 m (10 ft), and 4.32 m (14.12 ft) horizontally from the edge of the tank at
depths of 0.61m (2 ft) and 1.54m (5 ft). Each tank is equipped with a plastic curtain 0.4
m (1.3 ft) from the edge of the tank that hangs from the water surface to the bottom of the
tank, designed to protect the fish from injury due to collisions with the wall of the tank.
