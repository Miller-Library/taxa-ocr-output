full tailbeat was defined as a complete cycle when the tail returned to its starting position.
Tailbeats/sec were calculated for a constant distance of 3m.
Tailbeat in TI was not quantified. Due to limited grid area, it was difficult to
observe tailbeats over a constant distance.

Cytochrome Oxidase and Myosin ATPase enzyme assays were performed on 8
um thick tissue cross sections of goldfish, wild tuna red muscle, wild tuna white muscle,
quarantine tuna red muscle, quarantine tuna white muscle, TRCC tuna red muscle, and
TRCC tuna red muscle mounted on the same slide.
The cytochrome oxidase assay was adapted from the protocol of Old and Johnson
(1988). The assay solution contained the following reagents mixed in order, kept on ice
and protected from light: 1 ml O.1M pH 7.6 phosphate buffer, 4 mM diaminobenzidine
and 100 uM cytochrome c. The control solution did not contain cytochrome c. Each
solution was applied to a slide of the seven tissues and incubated in a water bath at 35Â°C
for 30 minutes then dehydrated in an ethanol series and coverslipped with Permount.
The myosin ATPase assay was adapted from the protocol of Guth and Samaha
(1969). The acid preincubation medium contained 0.1 M sodium acetate. Five 40 ml
aliquots were prepared and adjusted to pH 4.00, 4.25, 4.50, 4.75 and 5.00 (+0.05). The
alkali preincubation medium (Barbital buffer) contained 50 mM sodium barbital, 50 mM
sodium acetate, and 30 mM CaCl,'2 H,O. Five 40 ml aliquots were prepared at pH 9.50,
9.75, 10.00, 10.25, and 10.50 (+0.05). The ATPase reaction medium contained 2.73 mM
ATP in the Barbital buffer at pH 9.4. Slides were preincubated in acid treatments for 5
