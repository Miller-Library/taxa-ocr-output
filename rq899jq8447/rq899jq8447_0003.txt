Aggression in Arctonoe vittata

LSUET
Worms were observed in a fingerbowl, between glass plates
separated by 8 mm., and in a 7 mm. diameter plastic tube for
twenty minute periods in both light and darkness. Only one
bite was observed. These same worms would readily attack each
other on a host. Thus the host possesses some unidentified
factor needed to release the aggressive response,
Bites tore off elytra and produced open wounds and torn
appendages. Bites almost always were directed at the prostomial
region. There was considerable interworm variability as to the
duration of bites, some lasting up to 5 seconds. The most
bites recorded in a five minute period by one worm was 4 bites,
never in rapid succession.
When two worms first contacted each other they frequently
jerked away. When nearing again, the palps were extended;
fighting was most likely to occur if the worms' prostomiums were
in contact. Worms "reared up" slightly before they attacked.
Conversely, worms that assumed a "head down" posture in which
they lowered their prostomial region relative to their opponents
almost never were bitten; the other worms just slid by. Only
once in 15 trials was a worm attacked when in this position,
xperiment 1: To see if the worms exhibited differing
levels of aggression, five worms were tested together. Each
worm in the group was tested against the others 4 times in the
