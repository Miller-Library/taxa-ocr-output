Aggression in Arctonoe vittata
All others were found in new hosts. When this was repeated,
the most aggressive, worm C, was the only worm on the host.
All 4 others had found new hosts.
Arctonoe sometimes switches to new hosts spontaneously.
Throughout the six weeks of investigation, 7 out of 27 worms
changed hosts.
Experiment 3: Most of the injuries sustained during
fights were the removal of prostomial sensory appendages. To
see which sensory appendages contribute to Arctonoe's level
of aggression the following tests were done. In the first
test 4 new worms were tested against each other twice. The two
most aggressive ones were anesthetized in an isotonic solution
of MgClo and seawater and both palps were excised. After a
day's recovery, all four worms were tested against each other
twice. There was no change in the worms' behavior when the palps
were removed, (Figure 3). No control was done in the following
tests because the shock of anesthesia and the operation did
not seem to affect the two worms whose palps were removed (i, e.
reduce their aggression).
Next, four new worms were tested against each other once,
Under anesthesia, both palps, both sets of tentacular cirri,
and the three prostomial antennae were removed from the most
aggressive. After a day recovery the worms were tested once.
The most aggressive worm did not bite, (Figure 4).
Under anesthesia, the antennae were removed from the most
aggressive of four new worms. After a day recovery the worms
