Aggression in Arctonoe vittata
James Weisberger
off of the Monterey peninsula, California. Each worm was
measured to the nearest millimeter.
A series of tests were performed to determine whether
Arctonoe has different levels of aggression. The pallial
groove of the host proved to be the best environment to conÂ¬
sistently elicit the fighting response. In each test the
worms' behavior was observed and the number of bites exchanged
in a head-on encounter between two worms was counted. The
worms were provoked by gently nudging their posterior ends
with blunt forceps. As Arctonoe is sluggish, provocation was
necessary so that the worms would quickly move near each other,
Test periods for each encounter were five minutes. In the
first series of investigations groups of four or five Arctonee
were tested together. No individual was used in two different
groups. In the remaining studies selected worms were tested
against seven others.
The same C
ptochiton was used throughout the tests. It
had a total length of 25.5 cm., with its pallial groove meas-
uring 17 cm. long and 0.7 cm. wide. The (
ptochiton was lain
on its dorsal side so that its pallial grooves could be more
easily seen. Gently flowing seawater bathed the host during
tests, submerging the worms.
Aggression is quantified in this paper by the number of
bites, accomplished by rapid eversion of its armed proboscis,
that an Arctonoe delivers to conspecifics in a given time period.
