Aggression in Arctonoe vittata
James Weisberger
Table 1 shows the injuries sustained by the first group after
4 trials. In all cases one of the palps are missing, yet
clearly there are aggressive worms here. The most aggressive.
averaging 5 attacks per test, was missing both palps. This
data substantiates the results of the experiment in which the
palps were excised and no change in aggression was observed.
It is curious that the palps play no critical role in aggression
as they are conspicuously employed during worm interactions.
The least aggressive worm, averaging only 1 attack per test.
was missing an antenna. This supports the results of the experÂ¬
iment in which the antennae were removed and a significant change
in behavior was noted.
Perhaps the reason that worms usually attack the prostomial
region is to bite off the opponent's antennae, thereby reducing
chances of retaliation. Evans (1971) states that the antennae
are used in distance chemoreception to detect the host and that
the palps are used in contact chemoreception to recognize the
host. It could be hypothesized that an Arctonoe without antennae
cannot detect his opponent easily and therefore is not quickly
aroused to aggressive behavior. Exactly how the antennae
mediate aggression is not yet known.
