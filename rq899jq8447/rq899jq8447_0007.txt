Aggression in Arctonoe vittata
James Weisberger
from others, as the host provides both protection and food,
Perhaps the amount of food available to Arctonoe on the host
is not very abundant. If this is the case, then a high aggress¬
ive level would be of selective advantage to the worm in com¬
petition for this scarce resource. Dimock (1974) states that
intraspecific aggression within Arctonoe results in the density
which occurs in the field, namely, one large worm per host,
The word "large" is important here. As shown in Table 1
and Figure 1, the smallest worm does not follow the linear
relationship. This is because it would not attack the larger
worms of 60+ mm. length. Out of a total population of worms
in the study, worm E was the smallest in both length and width,
Dimock (1974) also states that very small worms of Arctono
pulchra were never observed to bite the largest worms. Un-
fortunately, he gives no measurements.
There is no consistent slope to the attack vs. attacked
lines of Figure 2. However, the number of worms available was
limited (27 total) and more samples would presumably have in¬
dicated if there is one standard slope of the lines. These
lines point to a "hierarchy" between worms in a group, much
like a pecking order, with one worm on top and others below him.
The fact that the most aggressive worm stayed on the host while
the others left in experiment 2 points to the aggressor's
dominance.
There is nothing ritualistic about Arctonoe's aggressive
behavior; injuries are serious and sometimes lead to death.
