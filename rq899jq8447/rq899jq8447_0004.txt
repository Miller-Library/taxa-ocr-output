Aggression in Arctonoe vittata

space of 8 days. The number of times a worm attacked and the
number of times the worm was attacked by others was recorded.
Prior to testing, the worms had no injuries. After the tests,
the worms were checked for injuries. The results are in Table 1.
There is an inverse relationship between the number of times
a worm attacked conspecifics and the number of times a worm
was bit by them: the more a worm attacked, the less he was
attacked, and vice versa (Figure 1). The reason worm E (the
circled dot in Figure 1) does not follow the linear relation¬
ship may be because it was very small and would not attack the
larger worms. In a different series another 30 mm. long worm
exhibited the same pattern of response.
Three other groups of four worms apiece were tested for
evidence of different levels of aggression. The worms in each
group were tested against each other twice in two days. The
results are shown graphically in Figure 2. Linear relation¬
ships are evident.
Experiment 2: To test the effectiveness of the observed
"hierarchies", all five worms from Group 1 were put in the
pallial groove of one Cryptochiton. Four other Cryptochitons
without worms were placed in the tank. They were left over¬
night.
The most aggressive, worm C, remained in the pallial groove.
Worm E, the smallest one, was found in the groove of the mantle
of the host, apparently not large enough to evoke full aggression.
