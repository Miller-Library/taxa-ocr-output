INTRODUCT
Aggressive behavior characteristic of territoriality has
been reported for several polychaetes. The polychaete Nereis
pelagica exhibits a fighting response which is linked to tube
defense (Clark 1959). The polynoid Hesperonoe defends the
burrow it shares with Urechis against polychaete invaders.
Dimock (1974) found that as a result of aggressive interactions,
Arctonoe pulchra distributes itself so that there is only one
individual per host. To date, intraspecific aggression in
Arctonoe vittata has not been reported.
In California waters Arctonoe vittata occurs most commonly
in the pallial grooves of the keyhole limpet Diadora aspera,
the starfish Dermasterias imbricata, and the giant chiton
Gryptochition stelleri. The scent of the host is detected at a
distance by receptor organs on the prostomial antennae. Hosts
are recognized on contact by sense organs in the palps (Evans
1971). In this paper data are presented which show that adult
A. vittata have differing levels of aggression and that groups
of these worms, through aggressive interactions, constitute
hierarchies. It is seen that removal of the antennae drasticÂ¬
ally curtails the worms' fighting behavior.
RIALS AND METHODS
MA
Arctonoe vittata were obtained from only the giant chiton
ptochiton stelleri. The chitons were collected subtidally
