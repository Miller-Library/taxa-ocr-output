Aggression in Arctonoe vittata
James Weisberger
SUMMARY
1. Adult Arctonoe vittata were tested in head-on aggressive
encounters in the pallial groove of a Cryptochiton host.
2. Arctonoe was found to have intraspecific differences
with respect to levels of aggression.
3. The most aggressive worm in a group successfully
defends a host against others, evicting conspecifics,
4. Removal of the palps had no effect of the worms
aggression, but antennae removal significantly reduces aggressive
behavior.
