Aggression in Arctonoe vittata

were tested twice. The antennae removal affected the worm's
aggression level, changing it from an average of 4.5 attacks
per test to an average of 0.5 attacks, (Figure 5). The an-
tennae seem instrumental in maintaining aggressive behavior.
These results were confirmed by testing the most aggressive
of 8 new worms against the other seven. After antennae removal
and recovery, it again was tested. The results in Table 2
indeed show that antennae removal results in significantly
reduced aggression. Using a 2X2 contingency table, a "P" value
of less than .005 was achieved.
ISCUSSION
Arctonoe vittata is an obligate commensal. Apparently,
being isolated from a host produces abnormal behavior, a
manifestation of this being the conspicuous lack of intraÂ¬
specific aggression. This is consistent with Dimock (1969).
who found that Arctonoe would bite a sea star while on its host
but at no time did an isolated worm bite a sea star.
Intraspecific aggression seems to be a way to effect
uniform distribution of large Arctonoe on a host population.
This is shown in the experiment in which five worms were placed
on the same host. In once case only the most aggressive worm
was left. In another run, the most aggressive and the smallest
were left. It could be hypothesized that Arctonoe, being an
obligate commensal, defends the pallial groove of its host
