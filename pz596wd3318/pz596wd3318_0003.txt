Study Sites
Ihree sites were chosen along a wave exposure gradient on the Monterey
Peninsula in Pacific Grove, California, USA (Fig. 1). The most protected site was
at Hopkins Marine Station (hereafter HMS) located on Point Cabrillo. The study
site faces north and is protected from waves by several off-shore rock
formations. The intertidal zone is horizontally broad and gently sloped. It also
includes many medium to large boulder clumps, creating small "islands."
Morphology data was taken immediately to the west of Agassiz Beach while the
distribution was measured over a 30m by 120 m area of the intertidal.
The intermediately exposed site was on the west side of Lovers Point
(hereafter LVR). It is very narrow with many steep, almost vertical faces and the
north/northwest facing study site is approximately 30 m long. The most exposed
site was on the north face of Point Pinos, (hereafter PTP). It is a very broad and
gently sloped rocky shore several hundred meters long. The gradient was
established using off-shore wave heights taken near the Monterey Bay Aquarium
(Monterey Bay Aquarium, unpublished data), located near the study site at HMS,
as well as by regression formulae which predict wave heights near the other two
study sites (Graham 1995).
All measurements were made in months of April and May, 1996.
