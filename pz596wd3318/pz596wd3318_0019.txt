Appendix 1. Determination of maximum wave heights and drag force
Hydrodynamic forces on a wave-swept shore consist of lift, drag, and
acceleration. The lift force acts perpendicular to the direction of flow and is
proportional to area. Drag is also proportional to area but acts in the direction of
flow. Acceleration also acts in the direction of flow but is proportional to an
object's volume. The effects of lift and acceleration are usually small in relation
to drag (Denny 1995, Gaylord et al. 1994) which is why only drag is considered
in these calculations. The relative exposure of the three study sites was
determined by visual estimation of wave height and offshore wave heights at
each location as determined from wave height data and regression formulae
(Monterey Bay Aquarium, unpublished results, Graham 1995). To estimate
relative wave forces at the three sites lused these off-shore wave heights.
Extrapolating from off-shore wave heights to degrees of in-shore exposure,
however, is very complex and involves making empirical measurements of
topography at each site (Denny 1995). In addition, local variations in topography
might make exposure highly variable on a scale of meters within the same site
(Bell and Denny 1994).
Taking the average maximum significant wave height at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium from 1987-1992 as the maximum significant wave height at HMS,
applied this value to a Graham's (1995) regression formula to find the maximum
height at PTP. From this maximum wave height, I found the am..
