Figure 4. Morphological features with significant univariate F-tests. Significant
differences (p20.05 as determined by a Tukey's test) are marked by a * while
non-significant differences are marked by "ns". Error bars illustrate +/- one
standard error.
(a) Lengths of internodes 1-3 at HMS, LVR, PTP in millimeters.
(b) Cross-sectional areas of internodes 1-3 at HMS, LVR, PTP in millimeters?,
(c) Bushiness at HMS, LVR, PTP. The internode number on the y-axis was
determined by the convention illustrated in figure 2.
Figure 5. Scatter plot of the separation of three populations based upon
morphology and breaking strength. The x-axis (factor 1) is a combination of
variables which maximizes differences among sites. The y-axis (factor 2) is a
second combination of morphological variables with the second largest
difference among sites but is also statistically independent from factor 1.
Figure 6. Cumulative probability curve of breakage versus breaking strength.
The applied stress (breaking strength) is shown on the x axis with the probability
of breaking at that stress shown on the y axis. This curve illustrates that for a
given stress, plants at LVR are much more likely to break than those at PTP or
HMS.
