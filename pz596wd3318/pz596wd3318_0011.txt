strength could be adaptations to wave exposure. There were no significant
differences in internode area between these two sites so the plants do not grow
thicker fronds at PTP to adapt to wave exposure. Plants at PTP are stronger
than those at HMS; for a given breaking strength, PTP plants are less likely to
break than those at HMS. Changes in algal material properties as a response to
wave exposure have also been studied in Egregia menziesii (Kraemer and
Chapman 1991); the strengths of young Egregia thalli were greater when grown
in high energy situations than those grown in low energy situations. Increasing
the material strength of the algal tissue, therefore, may be one adaptation of PTF
plants to wave exposure.
Another feature which significantly differs between HMS and PTP is
internode length. There could be several explanations why internode lengths at
PTP are approximately twice those at HMS. First, the internodes could grow to
longer lengths at PTP and branch less. Second, the plants at PTP could prune
and break off branches due to wave forces, making a longer internode out of two
or more shorter internodes. The second explanation may be more likely
because l observed many long internodes at PTP which were actually the result
of two shorter internodes separated by a scar where a branch had been broken
off. In addition, pruning could be an adaptation to wave forces. The drag force
is proportional to the amount of area on an object. It is possible that Pelvetia
adapts to wave forces by reducing area on which drag may act while maintaining
the same internode thickness. This adaptive characteristic has been seen in
other fucoids (Blanchette 1994) and mechanical limits to size due to wave forces
