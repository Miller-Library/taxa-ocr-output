intertidal organisms is due to a combined effect of these factors. In addition.
without conducting long-term demographic studies or reciprocal transplant
experiments, one cannot disregard demographic factors or site-specific
characteristics in a study of exposure and morphology/distribution. Age
structures of the populations at each site may be different, causing widespread
differences in morphology. Since the growth rates of Pelvetia may be negative
(Gunnill 1979), it is difficult to ascertain growth rates and ages. An age structure
could only be determined by following plants over a number of years. One way
to determine if the environment is responsible for the morphological variability in
Pelvetia would be to perform reciprocal transplant experiments between
protected and exposed sites. Such an experiment has been conducted on
Fucus gardneri (Blanchette 1994); the results supports the hypothesis that wave
forces directly influence plant morphology. A reciprocal transplant experiment
should be done with Pelvetia in conjunction with a discriminant function analysis
This would show whether transplanted thalli from site "a" looked more like those
at site "a" or those at the site of transplantation, site "b" after a certain amount of
time. If the discriminant function classifies thalli transplanted from site "a" to site
"b" as site "b" plants, it would further strengthen the claim that wave exposure
strongly influences the morphology of Pelvetia.
