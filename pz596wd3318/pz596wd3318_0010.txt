shown that the abundance of other fucoids varies through time with
environmental conditions, usually due to desiccation stress (Gunnill 1980). In
addition, it has been noted that the Pelvetia population at HMS has declined
sharply in the last 20 years (Watanabe, Baxter personal communication). It is
possible that desiccation stress at HMS may have killed a large percentage of
the population and that such environmentally-dependent variability may be an
important factor in Pelvetia's ecology. The lower wave exposure at HMS,
therefore, may have contributed to a decrease in abundance through desiccation
stress. Percent cover and density at LVR and PTP may be similar for several
reasons. The actual wave exposure at these two sites may be very similar or
there may be a threshold wave exposure which allows Pelvetia to reach a
maximal abundance, after which its abundance becomes limited by other factors
such as competition for space.
Morphology
The discriminant function analysis showed that the three populations are
morphologically distinguishable since most plants were accurately classified. In
addition, single factor ANÃ–VA's showed that several morphological features as
well as breaking strengths varied significantly among the sites. Since these
three populations are statistically distinguishable, I hypothesized that there may
be biological reasons for this separation.
To elucidate the biological reasons behind the morphological differences,
first examined differences between HMS and PTP, the two sites at the extremes
of wave exposure and asked if the variability in morphology and breaking
