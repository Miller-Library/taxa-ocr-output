Introduction
Wave exposure is an important factor in the ecology of the rocky intertidal
shore. It consists of a complex set of biotic and abiotic factors (Cousens 1982)
and plays an important role in structuring intertidal communities (Dayton 1971.
Sousa 1985). In addition to its effects on entire communities, wave exposure
often influences the zonation of individual species along the intertidal shore
(Stephenson and Stephenson 1949, Carefoot 1977, Ricketts et al. 1985). Ã–ther
effects on individual species include changes in growth rate (Cousens 1982) and
changes in morphology (Denny et al. 1985, Gaylord et al. 1994, Blanchette
1994, Cousens 1982). In addition, material strengths of algal thalli may increase
in high energy environments (Kraemer and Chapman 1991). Such changes
reflect adaptations to stresses associated with wave exposure.
In this study, I asked: Does the morphology, material strength, and
distribution of Pelvetia compressa, a common intertidal alga, vary at three sites
along a wave exposure gradient in a quantifiable, statistically significant way?!
measured several characteristics of Pelvetia thalli at these three sites, including
length, holdfast dimensions, internode dimensions, and material strength. also
quantified percent cover, density, and vertical ranges of Pelvetia at each
location. Secondly, I asked, if morphology, material strength, or distribution does
vary at each site, can any of this variability be an adaptation to wave exposure?
