Figure 1. Map of study sites along Monterey Peninsula. The inset shows a
closeup of the peninsula with the study sites labeled.
Figure 2. Morphology measurements
a. Measurements made upon each thallus. (a) the number of stipes emerging
from each holdfast. (b) dimensions of the cross sectional area of the stalk. (c)
dimensions of cross sectional area of holdfast. (d) length of thallus.
b. Measurements made upon randomly selected frond in each thallus. The
internode lengths and cross sections were measured. An internode is defined as
the distance from one fork to the next. Internodes are numbered with integers.
The internode numbered "0" is the one which emerges from the holdfast before
any branching begins.
Figure 3. Distribution of Pelvetia at three sites. Significant comparisons (ps
0.05 as determined by a Tukey's test) are marked by a """ while non-significant
comparisons are marked "ns". Error bars illustrate +- one standard error.
a. Percent cover of Pelvetia at three sites.
b. Density of Pelvetia in number of individuals per m2.
