A PTP plant with an average length per area of 0.319. m’/m and an
average length of 0.368 m would experience a drag force of 501.4 N. If it had
the same average length per area as HMS plants (.4199 m2/m), it would
experience of a force of 660.0 N. An average length plant at HMS (0.396 m)
would experience 441.5 N. Without the reduction in area per length, a PTP plant
experiences 1.49 times the drag force as a plant at HMS. Äfter the reduction in
area per length, the PTP plant experiences only 1.14 times the drag force as a
plant at HMS
