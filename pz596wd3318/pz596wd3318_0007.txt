Strength as a Material Property
lo find the strength of the thallus as a material property, the breaking
strengths of approximately 100 plants from each site were measured using a 20
kg spring scale and nylon webbing to hold each frond. The webbing was
wrapped around the end of each frond and attached to the spring scale. The
scale was then pulled until the frond broke cleanly. The cross sectional area of
each break was found by measuring the dimensions of each break and the
breaking strengths were computed as:
=Breaking Force (Newtons))/(Cross Sectional Area of Break (m2))
These strengths were ranked in numerical order and each rank was given
a probability of:
probability - rank
n+1
with n= total number of plants at each site. These probabilities were graphed
versus their associated breaking strengths to show the probability of breakage
for a plant at each site given a certain breaking strength. The mean strengths
from each site were tested with a one-way ANÃ–VA followed by a Tukey's test to
test differences between means.
Results
Distribution and Vertical Height
The vertical range of Pelvetia was similar at LVR and PTP. At both
these sites, Pelvetia extends both higher and lower in the intertidal height range
than at HMS (Table 1).
