Distribution and Vertical Range Measurements
1o establish the vertical range of Pelvetia, I used a surveyor's transit and
stadia rod. Heights were measured relative to a USGS benchmark (at HMS) or
relative to the predicted height of the water at low tide (PTP and LVR).
To measure percent cover at HMS, I sampled random points within the
vertical range of Pelvetia inside a 120 m by 30 m transect. Using a 0.25 m-
quadrat, I counted the percent cover and number of individuals inside each
quadrat. At LVR, 0.25 m2 quardrats were placed randomly within two transects,
one 30m by 2 m and the other 23 m by 2 m. At PTP, three 30 m by 2 m
transects were sampled. The percent cover and densities were compared with a
one-way ANÖVA followed by a Tukey's test to determine significance of
differences between sites. The ANÖVA calculations for density measurement
were performed upon log,, transformed data due to heterogeneity of variances.
Morphology
The following features of Pelvetia were measured for thalli at each site
(figure 2): maximum frond length (to nearest centimeter), number of stipes per
holdfast, and holdfast and stalk cross sectional area (to nearest 0.01 mm). For a
randomly selected frond in each thallus, the following features were measured:
internode lengths (to 0.01 mm) and areas (to 0.01 cm2) for lowest 3 internodes
breaking strength of the frond (Nem2), and location of first non-dichotomous
branching (hereafter referred to as "bushiness"). Twenty-five plants were
measured at HMS, 22 at LVR, and 24 at PTP.
