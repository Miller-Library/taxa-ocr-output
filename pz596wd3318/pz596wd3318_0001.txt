Abstract
Wave exposure is a complex set of biotic and abiotic factors, including
variations in physical force, light, temperature, and nutrient levels. This study
examines the distribution and morphology of an intertidal rockweed, Pelvetia
compressa (Fucales, Phaeophyta) at three sites along a wave exposure gradient
on the Monterey Peninsula, California, USA. Percent cover and vertical ranges
were similar between the most exposed and intermediately exposed sites and
much greater than at the most protected site. A discriminant function analysis of
morphological data shows that the three populations may be objectively
classified into three groups based on morphology. Ã„fter a discriminant function
analysis, it is possible to accurately predict the site of origination for most of the
thalli examined. Patterns between the morphological data from the extremes of
wave exposure suggest that plants at the most exposed location tend to break at
lower internodes, producing a "leggy" and pruned morphology compared to
those at the protected site. This pruning may serve to lower drag forces and
hence be an adaptation to heavy wave exposure. It is unclear from the data
what factors are responsible for patterns seen at the intermediate exposure site;
differences in age structure or other demographic factors may play an important
role.
