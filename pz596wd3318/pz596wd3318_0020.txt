ams is not the standard deviation of surface elevation but only the root-mean¬
square of the amplitude of waves. Using the statistics of extremes (Longuet¬
Higgins 1952),I found the maximum wave amplitude:
dmax - (n(f 1)
Ddms (2) (Longuet-Higgins 1952)
2I()
with f=1/9 s" (Denny 1995), 0 = .5772, and t = 8 hours since the measurements
made for the off-shore wave heights at the Monterey Bay Aquarium were taken
every 8 hours.
The maximum wave velocity for a turbulent bore running up the beach is:

Imax — 8 (20ma)
with una= maximum water velocity and g= 9.81 m:s2. For PTP, the maximum
wave velocity was 9.55 m.s" while at HMS, the maximum wave velocity was 7.22
m.s.
The maximum drag force was calculated as:
Fa =3puPSpAp (4) (Denny 1995)
with p=density of seawater, 1024 kg-m“, Sap =the shape coefficient which is a
constant for each organism at a particular orientation to flow = 0.18 (Gaylord,
personal communication), ßy is the velocity coefficient = 1.7 (Gaylord, personal
communication), and Ap, is the maximum projected area
