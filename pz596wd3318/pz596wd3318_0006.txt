Distinctness of the morphologies at the three sites was determined using
discriminant analysis. The discriminant function analysis is a multivariate
statistical technique which creates linear combinations of the morphology
variables to maximize differences among the study sites. Next it applies this
discriminant function to individual observations to classify whether a plant came
from HMS, LVR, or PTP. If the morphologies are different at the three sites, the
discriminant function should correctly classify each plant. If they are similar, the
discriminate function will not classify them correctly. In addition, the separation
of the three populations may be graphically displayed as an xy-scatter plot. The
x-axis (Factor 1) represents a combination of morphological variables which
maximizes differences among the sites. The y-axis (Factor 2) is a second
combination of morphological variables with the second largest difference among
sites but is also statistically independent from factor 1 (Afifi and Clark 1984).
In addition, single factor ANÃ–VA's were performed on the morphological
features individually to test for differences among sites. Those which were
significantly different were tested with a Tukey's tests to find significant
differences between sites.
In addition, ten plants from each site were haphazardly removed from the
site to analyze thallus areas and lengths using the computer program NIH Image
1.55 (National Center for Supercomputing Applications). Each thallus was
spread upon a sheet of paper and videotaped. The image was imported into
NIH Image and traced to find the area.
