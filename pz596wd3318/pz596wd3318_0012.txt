have been postulated for other intertidal algae (Gaylord et al. 1994). Pruning
may reduce the area on a thallus and hence reduce the amount of drag if the
plants did not regain the pruned area by growing more at the tips of the thalli. If
the plants do lose area at PTP relative to those at HMS by pruning, the ratjo of
area to length should be less at PTP than at HMS. This is true (Table 6); hence.
the differences in internode lengths between the two sites may be related to
pruning as an adaptation to wave forces. Though the reduction of area per
length from HMS to PTP seems fairly small, this amount may be enough to
significantly reduce the drag forces on plants at PTP (see Appendix 1).
Cousens (1982) found that the morphology of Ascophyllum nodosum at
an intermediately exposed site was not necessarily intermediate compared to
sites at the extremes of exposure. Many morphological features at LVR are not
intermediate compared to those at HMS and PTP. Internode lengths are
intermediate compared to those at HMS and PTP; this result agrees with the
pruning hypothesis. If the plants prune as an adaptation to wave forces and the
wave forces are intermediate at LVR compared to HMS and PTP, then the plants
at LVR should prune an intermediate number of times. The average internode
length should be between those of HMS and PTP.
Internode areas at LVR were less than those at HMS and PTP (Fig. 4b)
and breaking strengths were much less (Fig. 6, Table 7). These results are
difficult to understand in terms of wave forces. If wave forces are greater at LVR
than at HMS, why would the thalli at LVR grow weaker and thinner than those at
HMS? There could be several explanations for the patterns at LVR. Ã–ther
