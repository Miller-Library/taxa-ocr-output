factors of wave exposure, such as temperature or nutrient levels, specific to the
amount of exposure at LVR may contribute to these patterns. The nutrient levels
may allow for more new growth at LVR, creating thinner and weaker internodes,
In addition, there may be other causes which are unrelated to exposure. The
reason for the morphologies at LVR may be specific to the population at LVRÂ¬
perhaps the plants are of a different age structure or different gene pool. The
results do not clearly suggest one possibility over another; further study should
be conducted on the population at LVR to determine what factors control the
morphologies and breaking strengths.
In conclusion, this study showed that the distribution, abundance, and
morphology of Pelvetia are distinct at these three sites along a wave exposure
gradient and that some of these differences may be adaptations to wave
exposure. The factors contributing to the distinct features of LVR plants remain
unclear. When conducting an ecological study of wave exposure, one must
remember that exposure consists of many factors whose relative influence may
change at different exposure levels (Cousens 1982). Most commonly associated
with wave exposure are mechanical factors (Denny et al. 1985, Denny 1988) or
wave-borne projectiles (Shanks and Wright 1986). In addition, there are
biological factors associated with water motion such as decreased desiccation
stress or temperature and nutrient levels. At a very exposed location,
hydrodynamic forces create a very extreme mechanical environment while
temperature and nutrient buffers due to increased water turnover create a less
extreme environment (Cousens 1982). The ultimate impact upon the ecology of
