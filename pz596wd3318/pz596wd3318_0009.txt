PIP plants had a lower ratio of plant area to length than those at HMS
(Table 6). At-test between HMS and PTP showed a significant difference
between the mean ratios of area to length at the 95% confidence interval.
-Breaking Strength as a Material Property
The cumulative probability of breakage versus breaking strength curve
illustrates that LVR plants are noticeably weaker than those at HMS and PTP
(Fig. 6). The PTP plants have the strongest material of all three sites. In
addition, a one way ANÖVA on the mean breaking strengths showed significant
differences (p « 0.05) among the three sites (Table 7). All pairwise differences in
means were significant by a Tukey's test (p«0.05)
Discussion
Pelvetia Distribution
The differences in vertical range of Pelvetia among the three sites is not
unexpected. Intertidal zones shift upwards along the shore and broaden when
exposure increases (Lewis 1964, Ricketts et al. 1985, Carefoot 1977). In
addition, the range found for Pelvetia at HMS agrees with that found by Doty in
1946 who studied intertidal zonation at HMS (Doty 1946).
It was unexpected that HMS would have such a low percent cover and
density compared to LVR and PTP since Pelvetia has been reported as a
protected intertidal species (Setchell and Gardner 1925). This pattern, however,
may still be related to the degree of protection of a shore. Cousens (1982)
describes exposed locations as "less extreme and less variable" (p. 194) due to
temperature and nutrient buffers created by greater water turnover. It has been
