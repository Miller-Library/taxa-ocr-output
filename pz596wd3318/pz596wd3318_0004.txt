The Study Organism-Pelvetia compressa
Pelvetia compressa (C. Ag., De Toni), formerly known as Pelvetia
fastigiata (J. Agardh, De Toni, De Cew and Silva in press) is a brown, perennial
intertidal alga, commonly found either isolated or in thick aggregations on top of
protected rocks in the mid-littoral belt from Coos Bay, Oregon to Lower California
(Ensenada) (Setchell and Gardner 1925). In the areas studied, Pelvetia
compressa is the only species of this genus; it will hereafter be referred to as
Pelvetia. The fronds branch closely above an ellipsoid holdfast in a dichotomous
fashion with apical growth (Lee 1980) but Pelvetia also is morphologically plastic.
Multiple apical cells may be initiated at sites of damage, so Pelvetia may appear
to branch in a non-dichotomous fashion. Pelvetia produces gametes yearly in
bloated reproductive structures called receptacles at the tips of ultimate
dichotomies and shed their gametes at low tide (Bold and Wynne 1978). Like all
fucoids, Pelvetia has only a diploid macroscopic phase and lacks alternation of
generations. Since the holdfasts of adjacent Pelvetia may fuse, one
morphological individual may represent not one but many genetic individuals.
Therefore, following the convention of Aberg (1989) a morphologically distinct
individual will be labeled a "plant" or "thallus" and not "individual". I define
"morphologically distinct" as an plant whose holdfast does not contact that of any
other. All plants in this study were reproductively mature and randomly selected
from the middle of the Pelvetia zone.
