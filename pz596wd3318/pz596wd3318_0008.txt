LVR and PTP also had similar percent covers and density; at both sites,
density and percent cover were greater than at HMS (Fig 3). ANOVA
calculations indicated significant differences (p « 0.05) among the three sites
(Table 2 & 3). A Tukey's tests showed significant differences of density and
percent cover (p « 0.05) between all pairwise combinations of sites except
between LVR and PTP.
Morphology
Compared to HMS plants, the plants at PTP appear tougher and "leggier.
The first several internodes are longer and most branching does not begin until
the 4th or 5th internode at PTP. These long internodes often have scars where
a branch had been broken off. Plants at LVR, however, appear to have much
new growth with very regular branching.
-Discriminant Function Analysis
The discriminant function correctly classified most of the plants from each
site (Table 4). The individual features which were significantly different (p «
0.05) among the sites were internode lengths, internode areas, bushiness, and
breaking strength (Table 5). In general, internode length increases from HMS to
LVR to PTP while internode areas are similar at HMS and PTP but less at LVR.
PTP plants begin to "bush" at lower internodes than those at HMS and LVR (Fig.
4). These features would create plants with thin internodes at LVR and plants
with long internodes at PTP. These results confirm qualitative observations
about the plants at each site. The separation of the three populations based
upon morphology may be illustrated as an xy-scatter plot (Fig. 5).
