Lee: Independent catch tentacle
complex and prolonged endogenous behavior pattern

released by an appropriate stimulus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Several clones of Metridium senile were collected
from the pilings at Wharf No. 2 in Monterey Bay.
Size Tranged from 5 to 7 cm in column height and
4 to 6 cm across the oral disk. Anthopleura elegantissima
were collected from the intertidal at Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove. They were approximately
4 om across the oral disk. Separate tanks with
running sea water at 14 C held the two anemones.
They were settled on movable rocks. Every 5 days they
were fed Tegriopus. To induce catch tentacle inflation
Metridium was placed in tentacle tip contact with
Anthopleura. This constituted the start of stimulus,
and responses were timed from this point with a
watch. The catch tentacle need not be fully inflated
to count as a response, but it must be markedly
distended. Catch tentacles around the oral disk
were divided into six 60ssectors. Each time the
point of stimulus became the center of sector one.
For microscopy a whole Metridium was relaxed in
7% MgCl, sea water 1:1 for over 14 hours. Tentacles
were transected at the base and cut open to expose
