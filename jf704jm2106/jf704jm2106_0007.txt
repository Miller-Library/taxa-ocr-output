Lee: Independent catch tentacle
have been described by van Marle (1976), and only
longitudinal fibers were mentioned. Batham and
Pantin (1951) described, in addition, circular
endodermal muscles, which were not observed in this
study. The catch tentacles have cross fibers oriented
at 90° (Figure 6). Higher magnification (1000 x)
revealed spindle-shaped cells. The thicker, longitudinal
fibers were closer to the epithelium and the cross
fibers were just above them. In swimming sea anemone
Gonactinia prolifera, tentacles were used for walkingi
and swimming. The tentacles had ectododermal longi-
tudinal fibers and endodermal circular fibers
(Robson, 1971). Although the activity of catch
tentacle is not as strenuous as walking and swimming,
the tissue undergoes frequent expansion and retrac¬
tion. The crossing muscular system also provides a
full range of motion in its aggressive behavior.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The catch tentacle of the clonally reproducing
Metridium senile represents a behavioral system with
some interesting properties. A simple structure with
complex behavior can be developmentally induced from
a regular tentacle, and it can regress to its
original structure (Purcell, 1977, Hand, 1955).
