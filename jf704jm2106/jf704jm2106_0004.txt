Lee: Independent catch tentacle
the endoderm. Videotape was utilized to analyze
aspects of Metridium catch tentacle behavior.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The typical action pattern of a catch tentacle
is described and illustrated in Figure 1.
(1) Before stimulation a catch tentacle is
still and unexpanded. It is more opaque than the
feeding tentacles.
(2) At initial contact with Anthopleura nearby
tentacles contract, and if the stimulus was large
the oral dise will retract.
(3) After a variable lag period catch tentacle
begins to elongate. This is caused by increase in
hydrostatic pressure, and maybe contraction of
muscle in the tentacle.
(4) Inflation starts at the base and moves up
to the tip. It is not a continuous process because
the catch tentacle repeatedly contracts and expands.
It can inflate to a maximum size of 0.5cm x 12 cm.
(5) The movements of the tentacle originate
at the base and transmit along the whole length.
It is analogous to the motion of a whip. Muscular
action move the inflated tentacle all around the oral
disc.
