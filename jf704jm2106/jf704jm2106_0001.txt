Lee: Independent catch tentacle
TRACT
The inflated catch tentacle of Metridium senile
behaves independent of the oral disk. Close obser-
vation during aggression toward Anthopleura elegantissima
reveals clues to its hydrostatic and neural separation
from the rest of the animal. In the development of
the catch tentacle from regular tentacle, changes in
cnidom, musculature, and nerve net are necessary to
make it a functional unit.
