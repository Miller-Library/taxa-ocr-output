Lee: Independent catch tentacle

tissue. Clonemates and objects fail to evoke elec-
trical activity. It would be exciting to find the
electrical stimulus that will release the agonistic
action pattern, beginning with an increase in hydro-
static pressure. A closer examination of the histoÂ¬
logical changes in the mesoglea, the musculature, and
the nerve net before and after induction will
provide insight to the control of catch tentacle
activity.
I thank Chuck Baxter for his advice on this
work and many stimulating discussions, and also for
critically reading the manuscript; Freya Sommer for
collecting animals; and the people at Hopkins Marine
Station for their enthusiasm.
