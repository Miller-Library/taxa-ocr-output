Lee: Independent catch tentacle
tentacles of a stimulated anemone gradually move
toward the site of stimulus. However there is lack
of coordinated movement among these tentacles.
Thus each tentacle can exhibit spatial orientation
toward the site of stimulation, though it is removed
from that sector.
Catch tentacles can be induced from feeding
tentacles in Metridium by prolonged contact with
non-clonemates (Purcell, 1977). She recorded changes
in size, opacity, and cnidom. Microbasic b-mastigophores
and atrichs are arranged from the most mature at the
tip to the least at the base (Watson and Mariscal, 1983).
The cells migrate to the tip after autonomy so that
the catch tentacle becomes effective again.
In addition to the observed increase in size and
nematocyst content a number of other changes must
occur to yield a fully functional catch tentacle.
The crossing muscle fibers of Metridium catch tentacle
lie very close to the epithelium. The mesoglea is
not distinct under the polarizing microscope. It is
likely that the connective tissue reduced during
development to allow the tentacle great extension
and ease of inflation. The tissue was fragile and
difficult to manipulate for biomechanical tests.
Since the normal tentacles are not affected by
