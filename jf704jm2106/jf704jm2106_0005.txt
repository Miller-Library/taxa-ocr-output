Lee: Independent catch tentacle
(6) The tentacle tip attaches anywhere on
Anthopleura. Nematocysts anchor it and then theet
Metridium contract and break the tip.
The aggressive behavior of Metridium was fairly
consistent. The response of catch tentacles followed
tentacle contact with Anthopleura. Catch tentacles
were inflated in 37/52 trials, or 71%. The response
times of this group varied greatly (Figure 2).
In this data the duration of stimulation (the time
the anemones were left together) varied from ten
seconds to the length of the trial. If the time
parameter was held constant at ten minutes, the lag
period maintained its high variability (Table 1).
The catch tentacle to inflate first was usually the
one closest to the site of stimulus (Figure 3).
Of the 37 anemones that responded, 21 or 51% inflated
more than one catch tentacle. This would occur
within a period of five minutes.
An inflated catch tentacle seems to be hydroÂ¬
statically isolated from the rest of the coelenteron.
When red food color was injected into the column of
an anemone with inflated catch tentacles, no color
appeared in the coelenteron of the catch tentacles.
The color diffused to all other parts of the animal.
Dye injected to an unstimulated Metridium was dis-
