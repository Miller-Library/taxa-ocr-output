Lee: Independent catch tentacle
INTRODUCTION
The movements of specialized, highly inflatable
tentacles in sea anemones were first described by
Gosse (1860). Hand (1955) described catch tentacles
as occurring in one percent of Metridium senile
in Central California. Catch tentacles have been
identified in six families of the acontiate anemones:
Diadumenidae, Sagartiidae, Metridiidae, Isopheliidae,
Sagartiomorphidae, and Haliplanellidae (Williams, 1975).
In Metridium catch tentacles are used in both intra-
specific and interspecific aggression (Purcell, 1977).
Purcell asserted that aggressive Metridium on the
edges of adjacent clones maintained anemone-free zones.
More recently these zones have disappeared and clones
are no longer segregated (Purcell, 1982). A similar
aggressive behavior was also observed in Anthopleura
elegantissima (Francis, 1973). Catch tentacles can
be induced after prolonged tentacle contact with
non-clonemates. After three weeks catch tentacles
were inflatable, and after nine weeks they were fully
differentiated (Purcell, 1977).
This study aimsto analyze the behavior pattern of
an inflatable catch tentacle, and the control of its
response and movement. Catch tentacles represent an
inducible developmental system which exhibits a
