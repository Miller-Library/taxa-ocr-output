Lee: Independent catch tentacle
The nerve nets of coelenterates have received conÂ¬
siderable attention, and a picture of separate
conducting systems controlling a variety of behaviors
with varying degrees of linkage between these systems
is emerging. The nerve net of Metridium has been
characterized for the mesentery and column
(Batham, et al, 1960, Robson and Josephson, 1969).
The neural control of the catch tentacle adds another
layer to this with a system having interesting and
tractable properties. Spread of excitation from the
stimulus site, tip of a regular tentacle, down to the
oral disc and to the catch tentacles takes much longer
than expected for conduction in a nerve net. The
wide range of response times of Metridium to ag-
gressive stimulus make speculation on the speed of
this conduction difficult. Probably there is some
utilization time to release the endogenous mechanism.
In any case the nervous control of the catch tentacle
appears to be independent of the general nerve net.
The feeding tentacles resume normal activities after
initial contact with Anthopleura, and lack remark-
able movement during catch tentacle aggression.
A large, noxious stimulus such as a hypodermic
injection causes overall contraction and retraction
of inflated catch tentacle. Five or six inflated
