Lee: Independent catch tentacle
charged before catch tentacles could be induced to

inflate. Methylene blue, carmine, and graphite
particles gave similar results.
Examination of the oral disc revealed that
catch tentacles occurred only between pairs of perfect
mesenteries (Table 2). Under the base of an inflated
tentacle one could see a mesentery pair coming
together, creating a small compartment. If the
mesenteric stoma closes and the circular and radial
muscles of that endocoel contract, that would isolate
the endocoel from the rest of the coelenteron
(Figure 4). Movements of the catch tentacle did
not affect the appearance or activity of feeding
tentacles. A Metridium often inflated 2 to 6 tentacles
without effect on the oral disc. Touching an inflated
tentacle caused it to retract, but with no reaction
around the oral disc. All the observations together
suggest a separate hydrostatic and neural control
of the catch tentacle from the oral disc and regular
tentacles.
Catch tentacles and regular tentacles were
anaesthetized, slit longitudinally, and prepared as
whole mounts for viewing. Figure 5 shows the
longitudinal muscle fibers of a regular tentacle,
