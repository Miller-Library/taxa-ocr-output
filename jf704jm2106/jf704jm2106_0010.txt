Lee: Independent catch tentacle
10
inflation of å catch tentacle, two possible explana¬
tions arise: (1) the increase in pressure to the
catch tentacle is very slight, (2) the structure of
the feeding tentacle is more rigid such that it
requires more pressure than a catch tentacle to extend.
Coelenteron pressure has a small pressure range,
averaging from 2.6mm to 6.5mm of water (Batham and
Pantin, 1950). A better explanation would be that
the catch tentacle lost structural support so that
small pressure changes can easily affect its size.
A catch tentacle can become six times longer in one
minute or less.
To summarize, a feeding tentacle near the pharynx
that is between a pair of perfect mesenteries can
be induced to develop into catch tentacle. During
this development structural changes in the muscle,
the mesoglea, and the nematocysts occur along with
the differentiation of a conduction system specific
to a catch tentacle. Together a whole complex
behavior system emerges that displays action patterns
and independent control.
Neural recording from the oral disc and tentacles
might reveal the properties of the conduction system.

spike in Anthopleura after contact with allogeneic
