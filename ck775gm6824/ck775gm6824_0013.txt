SERVATIONAL NOTE
Morphological studies on the polychaete are extremely
limited. Observational notes made in the laboratory are
included here in hopes of aiding further research in this
area.
Seemingly well adapted to its commensal existence,
the polychaete can wedge itself between the oral plates
of the seastar or within the ambulacral grooves to the
point of concealment. Although frequently oriented along
the edge of the ambulacral grooves, movement among the tube
feet is also common and increases when the seastar moves.
Often the worm can be seen extending its body into the water
before crawling from surface to surface of the host, and
will move among the granular tufts when aboral. No aggressive
behavior between commensals and host or between worms was
observed, although the polychaetes rarely lie close to one
another. If inverted, eversions of the proboscis can occur,
apparently in an attempt to right the worm. Commensals re-
moved from their host were not observed to eat small pieces
of squid after a two hour period.
Contained within the posterior segments of the poly-
chaete, is a white substance of unknown constitution and
function. Examination of 66 commensals showed 48 (72.7%)
with white coloration in posterior segments and 18 (27.3%)
without. Of those commensals reported without the white
coloration, eight had emitted the substance after proÂ¬
vocation while in a dish of slightly warm stagnant sea
