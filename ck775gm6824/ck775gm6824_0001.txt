INTRODUCTION
Experimental research on commensal relationships in
polychaetes has been largely limited to studies on host
specificity and recognition in the families Hesionidae
and Polynoidae (Davenport, 1950, 1953; Davenport, et. al.,
1960; Davenport and Hickok, 1951, 1957;Bartel and Davenport,
1956; Hickok and Davenport, 1957). Much of this work has
been devoted to the facultative commensal Ophiodromus
pugettensis (Johnson) [-Podarke pugettensis]. Members
of this species can be found free-living on wharf pilings
and on mud flats (Bartel and Davenport, 1956;Reish, 1961)
and as commensals on several Asteroid species including
Luidia foliata Grube (Hickok and Davenport, 1957) and
Patiria miniata Brandt (Bartel and Davenport, 1956).
A single field study by Lande and Reish (1968) in
southern California demonstrated the seasonal occurrence
of O. pugettensis on P. miniata, with highs occurring in
the winter and lows in the summer months. Commensal pop-
ulations on Patiria were also shown to fluctuate and vary
inversely with water temperature. Laboratory studies
concerning the behavior of the commensal on the host,
however, represent merely casual observations and the
nature of this relationship has only received speculation.
The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine more
thoroughly 0. pugettensis on P. miniata, both in the field and
in the laboratory, in an effort to elucidate the commensalÂ¬
host behavioral interactions. Observational notes on the
commensal itself are also included.
