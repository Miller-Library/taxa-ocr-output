significance for similar area populations. Significant
size and growth rate increases among 0. pugettensis as one
moves from subtidal to intertidal areas is indicated.
LABORATORY EXPERIMENT!
T
MATERIALS and METHODS
P. miniata with commensals were collected both
intertidally and subtidally off Hopkins Marine Station,
Studies were conducted over a six week period during
April and May 1976.
Specimens were maintained in 40 liter salt water
aquaria with circulating unfiltered sea water averaging
1° C above local water temperatures. To prevent loss
of worms drainage holes were covered with fine mesh
netting. Movement of the seastars and commensals was
unrestricted except when isolation was necessary. Plastic
containers 28x22x13 cm in which sea water could be cir¬
culated were then used. The following experiments were
conducted altering the system in each case as described.
Experiment 1--To determine whether commensals will
colonize hosts in the laboratory, a Patiria with ten
O. pugettensis was placed in a plastic tank with a con-
specific from which commensals had been removed. Eight
Ophiodromus were then introduced into the center of the
tank. The number of worms per seastar were counted at
irregular intervals over a period of 49 hours. Counts
were made directly through the glass when possible but
