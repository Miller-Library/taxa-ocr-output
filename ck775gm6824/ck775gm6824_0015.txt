Ophiodromus b
age 16
M. Serences
SUMMARY
1. The host-directed behavior of Ophiodromus pugettensis,
a commensal polychaete, was investigated in the field
and laboratory on Patiria miniata over a six week
period during April and May 1976 at Hopkins Marine
Station, Pacific Grove, California.
Field studies indicate:
2.
A. An increase in commensal populations with
increasing host size.
B. Commensal populations of 0. pugettensis
fluctuate with time.
C. Clumped distribution of 0. pugettensis on
P. miniata.
D. An increase in size and growth rate of
O. pugettensis moving intertidally.
3. Laboratory results suggest:
A. Commensal distribution on P. miniata after
small time periods is random.
B. Feeding as well as protection may be the
nature of the commensal existence of 0. pugettensis
on P. miniata.
C. Large number of commensals on individual P. miniata
are uncommon for long periods of time.
D. O. pugettensis populations on P. gigantea and
D. imbricata may be uncommon in the field due to
host ingestion of the polychaete.
E. Commensal O. pugettensis abandonment of P. miniata
is uncommon unless conditions are extreme.
