remained on the seastar. The distances traveled from the
host ranged from between .5 to 11 cm (mean of 4.1 cm).
Experiment 6—-To observe what would happen when a large
number of Ophiodromus were forced upon a Patiria, 25
Ophiodromus, of average size 9 mm, were placed on two
Patiria of sizes 5.5 and 6.3 cm, respectively. The 5.5
cm Patiria (A) was not fed throughout the experiment while
an unlimited supply of squid was fed the 6.5 cm host (B).
No more than eighteen commensals would remain on a
given seastar for longer than an hour despite repeated
replacements and, of those, at least four were found
aborally. After 24 hours eleven and six of the initial
worms remained on the seastars A and B,respectively.
Forty-eight hours later three were present on A and one
commensal remained on B.
Experiment 7—-To determine whether Ophiodromus are commensal
with Patiria for feeding purposes, a small piece of mussel
was placed in a crystallization dish filled with sea water
and a Patiria with sixteen commensals, which had been
starved for three days, was placed on top of the food. The
worms'reaction was observed using mirrors positioned so the
oral surface of the host could be seen through a dissecting
microscope.
During the course of an hour four of the commensals
came down to the food and everted their proboscises as many
