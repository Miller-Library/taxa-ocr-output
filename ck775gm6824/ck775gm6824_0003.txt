then removed and placed in a glass dish filled with salt
water. Measurements, to the nearest millimeter, were
made after approximately ten minutes when the initial
contraction response had subsided.

RESULT
Results for the field studies are summarized in
Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1 plots
the number of commensals per host versus average size
of P. miniata indicating an increase in commensal pop-
ulations with increasing host size. Figure 2 summarizes
the data on number of commensals per host versus frequency
of occurrence. The index of dispersion for sample size 35
is 54.386 (PK.025) indicating clumping. A significant
difference (PÂ£.05) (X2 test, N-2 degrees of freedom) from
this and a Poisson distribution is apparent. And, comparing
expected versus observed values, a substantially higher
occurrence of starfish without worms than expected is noted.
Table 1 records changes in commensal populations over
time for dive dates. The number fluctuations indicate
that the commensals commonly move on and off of Patiria.
It should be noted here that large 0. pugettensis were
rarely noted in the field aborally on P. miniata. Table
2 lists the size range of the commensalscollected, area,
date, sample size, mean, standard deviation and level of
significance between the two areas sampled. Also included
are size increases (mm/week) and corresponding levels of
