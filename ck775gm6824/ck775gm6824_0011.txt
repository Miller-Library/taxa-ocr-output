controlling commensal densities on hosts.
Size differences between commensals from the two
subtidal sampling sites may indicate that growth rates
for Ophiodromus are greater in nearshore and intertidal
habitats than in subtidal regions. Additional ecological
studies are needed, however, to determine the cause of
these findings.
Host abandonment was not observed in the laboratory
except under extreme conditions such as prolonged exposure
to air or overcrowding. Commensal intolerance of such
conditions, rather than host survival, may determine
whether Ophiodromus remains associated with the host.
Ophiodromus may not associate with P. gigantea and D. imbricata
due to host ingestion of the commensals.
Evidence from feeding experiments suggest 0. pugettensis
is commensal with P. miniata for feeding purposes as well
as protection. Commensal movement on the host showed no
periodicity and was generally restricted to the oral surface
of the seastar where protection and food supply seem greatest.
Yet, commensals seemed more selective in food preferences
than host Patiria. This may be of adaptive significance,
however, considering Patiria are scavengers and also of a
cannibalistic nature. It also implies that something
other than stomach eversion may be necessary before a
feeding response is elicited in the commensals.
Neither benefit or harm to P. miniata by its commensal
was indicated. And, initial observations with free-living
