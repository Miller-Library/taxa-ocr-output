Experiment 9—-To quantify the startle response, a sudden
contraction of commensals, the observation container was
given a sudden shake and the reaction of the Ophiodromus
when on top of, near the edge of, or not touching the host
food was noted. Results are summarized in Table 4. A
significantly fewer number of contractions occurred when
the commensal was not touching the food than in either
other case (PA.005, 2x2 Contingency Test).
Experiment 10—-To determine whether diurnal patterns of
commensal movement were obvious, freehand sketches to
scale of commensals positions on a Patiria were made on
graph paper and average distances from the nearest am-
bulacral grooves determined from this. The results are a
compilation of observations made irregularly over a nine
day period and are graphed in Figure 5 as the average
distance of commensals to the nearest ambulacral groove
of the host as a function of the time of day. No periodicity
in movement is apparent.
Experiment 11--To see if free-living Ophiodromus could
adapt to a commensal existence on P. miniata, three frée¬
living conspecifics, obtained among tunicates from wharf
pilings, were placed on a Patiria and observed for five
days. After this period, the seastar was fed a mixture of
unflavored gelatin, carmine red and squid extract.
Following initial placement on the Patiria, free-living
