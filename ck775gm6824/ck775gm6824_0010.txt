Ophiodromus behavior

Ophiodromus remained on the seastar throughout the five
day period. Movement was predominately on the oral surface
although worms were occasionally observed aborally. Although
two eversions of the proboscis were noted during host
feeding, no red particles were detected in the guts after
24 hours.
DISCUSSION
Experimental and field results suggest that commensal
distributions on Patiria are at least partially regulated
through behavioral controls. Field distributions showing
a higher occurrence of seastars lacking commensals than
expected from a Poisson distribution could be an indication
of preferential host colonization. When Ophiodromus were
given a choice between two Patiria in the laboratory, host
selectivity was again indicated although a larger sample
size would be required to support this hypothesis. A
random distribution was obtained in the laboratory after
extremely clumped initial conditions yet a longer dispersal
time may be required to obtain experimental distributions
approximating those in the field. Unnatural surroundings
or restrictions of space and food in the laboratory may
also account for this discrepency. Although commensal
densities per seastar increased with increasing host size
in the field, hosts artificially crowded in the laboratory
were unable to maintain large worm densities. Inter- or
intraspecific behavioral interactions may be important in
