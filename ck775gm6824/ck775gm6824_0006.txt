Dermasterias imbricata (Grube). Each seastar species was
maintained in a seperate aquaria and examined daily for
Ophiodromus.
Following day 1 only one commensal remained on each
of the Pisaster and by day 2 no commensals were evident
eitheronthe seastars or in the tank itself. No commensals
were observed on the Dermasterias after the fifth day.
Both observations suggest the commensals had been ingested
by their prospective hosts.
Experiment 4--To observe commensal behavior on an injured
host, two slashes approximately one centimeter long were
made through the aboral surface of a Patiria with eight
Ophiodromus. No commensals were observed abandoning their
host during eighteen hours of periodic observations.
During the first hour, however, the commensals remained
within or close to the ambulacral grooves and later move¬
ment was restricted to the oral surface.
Experiment 5—-To determine if commensals would abandon
their host after prolonged air exposure, a Patiria with
ten Ophiodromus was placed in a plastic container filled
with approximately fifteen millimeters of dry sand and
observed periodically for 69 hours.
Commensals remained on their host for at least 25
hours. After 48 hours, however, seven Ophiodromus had
crawled off the host and after 69 hours only one worm
