water. The material was not always totally discharged,
however, and anything remaining was concentrated in the
anterior portion of the segments. If the worm is anteriorly
provocated with a sharp instrument it will contract slightly
and back up tail first rather than turning around on itself.
Commensals without or with what appeared to be re-
generated tail segments were also observed. Movement on
and off the seastar did not seem to be hindered by such
alterations. Tail cirri were dyed in methylene blue to see
if any functional adaptations could be detected. Although
generally appearing to drag passively behind the polychaete,
they were frequently observed rigidly extended. Curved
positions, inwardly and outwardly, around tube feet or the
bases or oral plates were also noted. When a swimming
commensal was observed the tail cirri appeared to move in
a whip-like fashion.
