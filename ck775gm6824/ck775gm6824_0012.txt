Ophiodromus behavior

Ophiodromus indicate that at least temporary existence on
Patiria can be tolerated. Further studies are needed to
conclude whether such results can be maintained over long
periods of time. Larval settling studies, as begun by
Davenport and Hickok (1957), are also necessary to
elucidate the evolution and nature of these commensal
associations.
