FIELD STUDIES
MATERIALS and METHODS
Field studies on Ophiodromus pugettensis were made
over a six week period in April and May 1976 at Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. Forty-eight
seastars were tagged, measured and the number of commensals
per seastar recorded at a depth of approximately 30 feet
using SCUBA on April 20, 1976. Three subsequent dives
were made on April 21, May 7 and May 26, and the number
of commensals per seastar counted on each occasion.
The seastars were marked using numbered plastic
laundry tags which were shot approximately 1 cm deep
into the aboral surface of the seastar. No permanent
injuries were sustained by the seastars using this
method. Measurements to the nearest millimeter were
made of the seastars from the tip of the longest ray to
the opposite web.
In addition, fifteen seastars with a total of 75
worms were collected on May 12 on SCUBA at a depth of
25 feet. Thirty-one seastars with a total of 111 worms
were collected one week later skin diving at a depth of
20 feet approximately 25 feet towards shore from the
previous site. Two weeks later seastars were collected
on SCUBA from both areas; fourteen with 38 worms from the
first area and thirteen with 41 worms from the second.
The seastars were collected and later placed in an
aquarium for from one to four hours. The commensals were
