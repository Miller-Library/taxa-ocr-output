when commensals were obscured from view, seastars were
removed and the number of worms counted outside the tank.
Replacement in the tank was made as close as possible to
the original position.
The results are diagramed in Figure 3. Two worms were
without hosts at the conclusion of the experiment. Initially,
six out of eight worms migrated to the host lacking commensals
implying preferential migration as well as dispersal of
O. pugettensis.
Experiment 2—-To discern whether field distributions of
O. pugettensis on P. miniata could be replicated in the
laboratory over a short time period, seventeen Patiria
lacking commensals were added to an aquarium containing
two conspecifics each with eighteen Ophiodromus. Seastars
were removed after five days and the number of commensals
per host recorded.
Results are summarized in Figure 4. Two Patiria
were without commensals following the experimental period.
The index of dispersion for sample size 19 is 23.18 (P2.4)
indicating randomness.
Experiment 3--Hickok and Davenport (1957) reported com¬
mensals with Patiria selectively responding (PK.001) to
Pisaster giganteus (Stimpson) in a choice apparatus. To
determine whether Ophiodromus commensal with Patiria would
accept alternate hosts in the laboratory, 24 commensals
were equally divided among two P. gigantea and two
