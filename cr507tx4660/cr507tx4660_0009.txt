Mites on amphipods
2. The percentage of infestation of the host population increases with size of
host and varied from 1.5% (hosts 3 - 7.9 mm) to 83.07% (hosts 16 - 19.9 mm).
Mites showed no preference for male or female hosts. The number of mites per
intested host increases slightly with amphipod size.
3. Mites were found attached, either by mouth parts or posterior end, exclu¬
sively on the ventral side.
4. The mites were found to leave dead hosts within 2 - 9 hours after death.
5. Nites without hosts can crawl over sand at an average rate of 3 inches per
minute.
Gammaridacarus brevisternalis were found, after leaving dead hosts, to attach
to new, living hosts. When contact between dead and living hosts was pre¬
vented, the mites traveled up to at least 30 cm in finding new hosts. Ob¬
servations suggest that the mites may possess senses for locating healthy
hosts at a distance.

I would like to thank Dr. Irwin E. Newell of the University of california.
Riverside, for his helpful suggestions and identification of the mite. Sam
Johnson, a graduate student at Hopkins Marine Station at the time of this study.
was very patient with my many questions about amphipods. Most importantly.I
would like to express my deep appreciation to Dr. Donald P. Abbott for his
guidance and enthusiasm.
