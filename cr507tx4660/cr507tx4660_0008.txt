Mites on amphipods
mites appear to be (1) other host species, (2) damp sand, and (3) damp wrack on the
beach. As previously noted, mites also infest the Orchestoidea californiana
population. Mites that had the appearance of those infesting 0. corniculata
were found in older, partially buried wrack. Dr. Newell has identified them
as the present species, G. brevisternalis, and noted (pers. comm. 1972) that he
has found these mites in southern California exclusively in the wrack. Samples
of the mites from Pacific Grove wrack, which appeared identical to the amphipod
mites when compared under a compound microscope, were introduced into a vial
with live uninfested amphipods. A day later they were found attached to the O
corniculata. The mites can live for prolonged periods apart from the host.
brevisternalis have been reported to live over a month on decomposing wrack placed
in closed plastic bags (Helen Kompner, pers. comm., 1972). I have kept the
mites stoppered in vials containing only tiny bits of beach wrack, and also in
vials containing only a pad of sea water soaked cotton for at least three and
one half weeks. In contrast, mites placed in an empty, corked glass vial overÂ¬
night were all dead the next morning.
Perhaps when the mites can not locate a new host quickly, they find in the
wrack a humid home to await eventual arrival of amphipods which normally feed
nightly on the wrack. The true relationship of the mites to the wrack and to
their amphipod hosts still remains a mystery, but whatever the answers, these
tiny animals seem to have worked out admirable means for survival.
Summary
The mesostigmatid mite, Gammaridacarus brevisternalis has been found and
identified on both decomposing beach wrack and on the beach amphipods
Orchestoidea corniculata and O. californiana.
