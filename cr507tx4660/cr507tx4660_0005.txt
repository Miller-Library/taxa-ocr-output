The transfer of mites between hosts
A small series of experiments was performed to determine if a shift in
mites occurs from one living host to another, and from dead to living hosts.
Tranfer between healthy hosts. One investigation was initiated to discover
if the mites constantly remain with their hosts even in the presence of other
heal thy amphipods. Live amphipods were first anesthetized with ethyl ether
fumes and then were examined very carefully under a dissecting microscope.
Both
mites and amphipods quickly and completely recovered from the anesthetic.
Amphipods were maintained in the laboratory using the methods of McClurkin
(1953). Into two 2cmx 9cm glass vials were placed cotton pads moistened with
seawater, and the tops of the vials were covered with cotton gauze to prevent
amphipod escape. One infested and one uninfested 0. corniculata were placed in
each of the two containers. After one to two days, each previously uninfested
amphipod bore at least one mite.
The mites are apparently relatively motile. They can shift from one living
host to another, at least when the hosts are close together. This physical proxÂ¬
imity occurs in the field especially during the night, when many closetly packed
O. corniculata can be found feeding on the wrack.
Mite reaction to host death. A similar experiment was set up to find out
the reaction of mites to the death of their host. Two live 0. corniculata
each
infested with two mites were killed by stabbing. They were immediately placed
in two McClurkin vials and left overnight. The dead hosts bore no mites the next
morning, and even the cotton in the vials appeared to be free of mites.
The same experiment was repeated in an aquarium tank filled with four inches
of damp sand similar to that in which the amphipods burrow during the day. Five
