INFESTATION OF THE SANDY BEACH AMPHIPOD ORCHESTOIDEA CORNICULATA
BY THE MITE GAMMARIDACARUS BREVISTERNALIS (LAELAPTIDAE)
by Donna Scurlock
Introduction
In California sandy beach communities, members of the amphipod genus
Orchestoidea are among the most abundant macrofauna. At night these beach
hoppers leave their sand burrows and may be found feeding in large numbers on
standed seaweed. As early as 1912. small, apparently ectoparasitic mites had
been found on these gammarids (Hull, 1912), and in later studies of Orchestoidea
both McClurkin (1953) and Bowers (1954) noted their occurrence. In both Oregon
and Washington, Canaris (1962) found Orchestoidea californiana Brandt, 1851
infested with males, females, and deutonymphs of a mesostigmatid mite which he
described as Gammaridacarus brevisternalis Canaris, 1962. These mites have
also been discovered in the sandy beach wrack by both Irwin E. Newell (pers.
comm., 1972) and the author.
This investigation was undertaken to extend our present scanty knowledge of
the nature and extent of the relationships between the parasite and host pop¬
ulations. Studies were carried out at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford Univer¬
sity, Pacific Grove, California from April to June, 1972. All collections were
made on the Monterey Boatworks beach located just east of Mussel Point, Pacific
Grove. This beach was found by Bowers (1964) to contain a beach hopper pop¬
ulation consisting solely of Orchestoidea corniculata Stout 1913. All individ¬
collected
ual amphipods were checked using keys in Bousfield (1959). Only 9. corniculata
occurs on this beach at the present time.
