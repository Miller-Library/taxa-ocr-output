Mites on amphipods
The percentage of infested males of the largest size class was lower than
that of the next smallest size class, while the females of the two largest sizes
showed similar percentages of infestation. The decrease found in the largest
males might be attributed to their tougher outer covering. Females of the largest
size class were all close to the lower length limit of this range (20mm) and so
were almost members of the next smaller class.
The average size of the mite population on individual infested hosts increased
slightly with host body size (Fig. 2), which is not surprising since larger hosts
have more room for parasites, and have had a longer time in which to acquire them.
One male in the largest size class carried a record-setting total of 33 mites.
Among those 0. corniculata which were infested, small mite loads were more common
than large loads (Fig. 3)
Distribution and attachment of mites on the host body
When live hosts were examined, occasionally unattached mites were observed
crawling on the ventral or sometimes dorsal side of the host, or on its appendages.
This behavior probably explains the presence of the small number of mites which
detached from the host body on preservation.
Attached mites, when observed on alcohol preserved hosts, were found exclus¬
ively on the ventral side of the amphipod body; here they ranged longitudinally
from the area between the first gnathopods to a position directly above the first
pleopods. Mites were found in every possible position on this flat, thin skinned
surface, and also on sites on the five pairs of gills (Fig. 4). The ventral surface
would be advantageous to a mite, for this area forms part of a protected and
probably humid chamber when the amphipod curls its body and crosses its gnatho¬
pods and pereôpods across its ventral side during its daily resting period in its
sand burrow.
