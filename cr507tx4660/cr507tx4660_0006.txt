Mites on amphipods
infested 0. corniculata were killed by stabbing and placed overnight in shallow
holes in the sand to simulate the death of amphipods in their burrows. All the
amphipods were found the next day to have no mites. Apparently the mites react to
the decomposing host and leave.
Einding a new host. Since mites leave after the death of their hosts, other
experiments were performed to determine whether mites can locate new, healthy
hosts. In one experiment, two dead infested amphipods were placed in separate
Mcclurkin vials, and a live, uninfested 0. corniculata added to each vial. One
dead amphipod bore one mite, and the other two mites, at the start of the ex¬
periments, but after 12 hours all the mites had transfered to the living amphi¬
pods.
A similar experiment was carried out in the sand tank. Five infested O.
corniculata with one mite each were killed and placed in holes in the sand, then
three uninfested live amphipods were added. After nine hours, one living O
corniculata individual bore all five mites and the remaining live and dead
amphipods had no parasites.
In these experiments, contact between the dead and living hosts was pos¬
sible. In the field, 0. corniculata have been observed eating dead individuals
of their own species (pers. obs.), a contact which should provide a good oppor¬
tunity for mite transfer.
Experiments were also performed to discover if mite transfer could take
place without close contact between hosts. Under normal beach conditions this
might involve mite movement across the beach. In order to test the mites'
capacbilities of locomotion in sand, a round dish of beach sand was prepared.
A mite was introduced at a marked spot on the sand, and allowed to move freely.
The mite's progress was observed under the dissecting microscope, and it appeared
to have no great difficulty traveling on the sand. Several mites, clocked for
