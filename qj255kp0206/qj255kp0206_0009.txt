Spirorbid Larval Behavior
S. Jensen
DISCUSSION
The description of settling behavior presented here agrees with
that given by Potswald (1965) for a species he identified as Spirorbis
morchi, and his descriptions of that species support the possibility
that S. mõrchi is a synonym for the species here called Pileolaria
sensu. The observations of Knight-Jones (1951) on settling in Spirorbis
borealis differ only slightly from the present account in that he
reported more rapid secondary tube growth (coiling through 90° within
5 hours after settling) and described a primary tube large enough to
cover only the trunk and abdomen of the animal. The primary tubes seen
here were stretched before hardening so that, after only a few minutes,
the larva could retract its head completely inside.
The general results of the filming experiments are entirely con¬
sistent with those of Gee (1965) and Knight-Jones (1951). They demon¬
strated that larvae of two species of Spirorbis in Britain settle
more readily on surfaces that have been filmed.
The contradictory, yet nonrandom, results of the extract experi¬
ment are difficult to interpret. An unknown factor other than chemical
substances associated with the algae must be involved. This may have
been some accidental difference in the handling of the tiles before
soaking. It is also possible that larvae selectively settle near other
spirorbids, so that once a larva has settled, it increases the prob¬
ability of further settlement nearby. Such gregarious behavior has
been demonstrated for S. borealis in Britain and for other benthic
invertebrates (Knight-Jones and Stephenson, 1950; Knight-Jones, 1951).
The alginic acid experiment yielded no evidence that this poly¬
saccharide, a structural element of many algal cell walls, promotes
