allowed to stand in a 6° C coldroom for one hour with occasional
shaking. It was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes and the
supernatant HAM filtered to remove algal cells and most bacteria. The
resulting clear solution was poured into Petri dishes containing
pieces of unglazed white ceramic tile with areas of approximately
4 cm". These tiles and control tiles in HAM filtered seawater were
soaked overnight in covered dishes at 3° C.
Into each of three clean glass bowls containing fresh HAM filtered
seawater was placed one tile from each set. Larvae were pipetted into
a collecting dish of HAM filtered seawater and from there into the
centers of the bowls. All were incubated in the dark at 12° C.
In another experiment, larvae introduced to three bowls of HAM
filtered seawater were given a choice between a ceramic tile that had
been soaked for 24 hours in HAM filtered seawater and one soaked for
the same time in a 0.5% solution of algin, a sodium salt of alginic
acid, in HAM filtered seawater. The tiles in two of the bowls had been
soaked at 3° C and those in the third at room temperature.
Results
The results of these experiments are presented in Table 3. All
three replicates of the extract experiment indicated significantly
nonrandom (p £.05) preferences, but the third contradicts the first
two, in which selection was toward the extract-soaked tiles,
In the alginic acid experiment, the sample sizes were smaller.
However, trials 1 and 2 show significant (p £.025) settling in
favor of the control tile. Trial 3, in which the tiles were soaked
at room temperature, gave the opposite result but does not meet the
95% significance level.
