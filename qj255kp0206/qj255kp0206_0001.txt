Spirorbid Larval Behavior

INTRODUCTION
Spirorbids are among the most abundant polychaetes found in the
rocky intertidal zones of Monterey Peninsula, where their coiled cal¬
careous shells encrust rocks and algae. They are filter feeders whose
bodies and tubes are marked by bilateral asymmetries. Recent work on
their systematics (Knight-Jones, et. al., 1975) proposes that they
comprise a distinct family, Spirorbidae, though they are usually
classified with the Serpulidae.
Most of the literature on the group consists of descriptive and
taxonomic studies. However, until recently there has been much dis¬
agreement about classification schemes, so that identifications of
California species have been incomplete and naming inconsistent.
These problems partly account for the fact that very little is known
about most aspects of spirorbid biology,
With the exception of the developmental studies by Potswald
(1965) in Washington, nearly all work on their general biology has
been done in Europe. Several investigators have examined the breeding
cycles, growth, and larval settling behavior of a few species asso¬
ciated with algae in Britain (Knight-Jones, 1951; de Silva, 1962;
Williams, 1964; Gee, 1965). This paper presents observations on the
distributions and settling behavior of intertidal spirorbids on
Monterey Peninsula.
DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES
All observations were made during April and May, 1976. Spirorbids
were collected from rocky intertidal areas around Hopkins Marine
Station and at Pescadero Point. Species identifications were attempted
