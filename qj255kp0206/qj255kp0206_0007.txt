Spirorbid Larval Behavior
S. Jensen
Two of the filmed and two of the unfilmed beakers were examined
8, 21, and 120 hours later, and the other two beakers were left undis-
turbed for 24 hours.
Results
The results of the discrimination experiment are summarized in
Table 1. Levels of statistical significance were determined using
the Chi-square test. It is clear, with both the natural (granite) and
artificial (brick) substrates, that the larvae preferentially select
surfaces that have been submerged.
For the second experiment, as indicated in Table 2, the results
obtained in the first four beakers are confused somewhat by settling
of many of the larvae in the unfilmed beakers onto two or three small
pieces of detrital material accidently introduced with the seawater.
The fact that so many larvae in the unfilmed beakers settled on tiny
loose objects indicates that the much larger unfilmed glass surface
was a relatively unsatisfactory substrate.
In the two undisturbed beakers, there were no interfering debris
in the water, and these results demonstrate that contact with an algal
or bacterial film stimulates earlier settling.

Methods and Materials
In an experiment based on one done by Gee (1965) to test the
specificity of Lithothamnion as a substrate for Spirorbis rupestris,
an extract was made by scraping rocks covered with filamentous green
algae and diatoms and immediately grinding the algae with a mortar
and pestle. To each ml of the ground algae were added about 12 ml of
seawater that had been filtered through an HA Millipore filter of
0.45 Am pore size (hereafter "HAM filtered"). This mixture was
