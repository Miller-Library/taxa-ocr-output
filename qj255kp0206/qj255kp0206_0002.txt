One species having six tentacles and incubating embryos within
its smooth, dextrally-coiled shell (genus tentatively identified as
Spirorbis) was found exclusively on Cystoceira blades from Pescadero
Point. This was the only specific association with an alga found;
all other species occurred primarily on rocks and shells and some¬
times on encrusting algae, especially Hildenbrandia. These species
were abundant in permanent, frequently awash tidepools and in shel-
tered areas exposed during low spring tides, notably in crevices or
beneath rocks.
Among spirorbids attatched to rocks and shells, at least four
species could be distinguished by obvious variations in tube appear-
ance, operculum structure, and the number, shape, and color of the
tentacles. Frequently, individuals of two or more species occurred
in close association.
The most numerous of these species, especially on the walls of
tidepools, was identified as Pileolaria (Simplicaria) sensu. It had
a large-diameter, chalky, opaque, and fairly smooth tube that coiled
sinistrally. There were seven brightly colored tentacles, and the
eggs were brooded in a modified operculum. This species was occa¬
sionally seen on Bossiella.
Two other common species may have been Paradexiospira (Spiror-
bides) vitrea and Spirorbis marioni, though these identifications
are much more doubtful. The former had six tentacles and a dextral,
translucent, glassy tube with prominent ridges running longitudinally
that gave the mouth a scalloped edge. The latter was also dextral
