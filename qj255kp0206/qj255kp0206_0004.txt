Spirorbid Larval Behavior

a brooding parent. Therefore, since the larvae were obtained from
rocks with mixed populations, they could not be positively assigned
to species. However, all for which the entire settling sequence was
timed developed into sinistral adults, and it is very likely that all
were Pileolaria sensu. Dextral individuals were observed in various
stages of settlement, and no deviations from the events described
below were noted.
Newly released larvae first appeared swimming upward and gathering
at the surface. For at least the first few minutes after release, they
exhibited a strong attraction toward light. The attraction reversed a
short time later, suggesting that these spirorbids are adapted for
brief, short-range dispersal of offspring. When removed by pipette
into collecting dishes, most larvae immediately reversed their photo-
taxis and began swimming along the bottom. It is possible that the
turbulence of pipetting hastened this change; there may be a selective
advantage in limiting dispersal time under turbulent conditions.
The larvae swam along surfaces during a searching period of from
20 minutes to many hours. A larva that was ready to settle would
change its behavior, crawling very slowly over the surface and
changing direction more and more often. During this time, which
usually lasted only a few minutes, larvae sometimes raised up as
though to swim away but appeared to be held in place by a posterior
connection to the substrate. This anchoring could be by the mucous
thread that Potswald (1965) found to be secreted by some searching
larvae.
In the minutes before settling, the larva would repeatedly
reverse direction over a distance of 1 to 2 mm, turning by laterally
