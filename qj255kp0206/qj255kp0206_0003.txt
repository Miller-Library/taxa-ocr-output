but had seven pale tentacles and a thick, white tube with faint longi-
tudinal ridges. Both brooded larvae in the tubes. At laest one other
species, a sinistral tube-brooder, remains unidentified.
Most adult tubes are between 1.5 and 2.0 mm in diameter, but some
P. sensu tubes may be wider than 3.0 mm.
OBSERVATIONS OF SETTLING BEHAVIOR
All spirorbids reproduce sexually and are hermaphroditic, They
brood their eggs until fully developed swimming larvae are ready to
hatch. For all of the species found here, a majority of the indi¬
viduals examined had broods. Larvae were collected from rocks densely
covered with spirorbid tubes by placing each rock in a small con-
tainer of cold (6° C) seawater and exposing it to bright light from
a microscope lamp. Five or six rocks at a time were so treated.
Usually, within two hours, swimming larvae appeared near the surface
in one or more of the containers.
A newly released larva [Fig. 1] is about 0.3 mm long. It has a
large thoracic region and a much smaller unsegmented abdomen. The
thorax has three distinct segments with extensible notosetae that do
not resemble the adult thoracic setae. The anterior part of the
thorax is partly covered by the collar. There is a distinct head area
with two ventral red eyespots. The gut can usually be seen as some¬
what more opaque than the thorax. The larva swims mainly with a
prototroch of long cilia anterior to the collar. It also has anterior
and posterior ciliary tufts and other less salient ciliary fields. A
prominent feature of the larvae observed settling was the white,
opaque primary shell gland covering much of the dorsal thorax.
At no time were larvae actually watched in the process of leaving
