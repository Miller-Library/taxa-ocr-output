Spirorbid Larval Behavior

bending the abdomen. It is not clear whether this activity involves
some preparation of the substrate. It could serve to ensure that
there is adequate free space for tube growth, although tubes often
overlap in the field.
Next, crawling stopped, and the thorax appeared to adhere to the
substrate. The milky, somewhat irridescent, fluid in the primary shell
gland was slowly secreted posteriorly, forced out by vigorous con¬
tractions of the body. During the first five minutes after settling,
the larva would roll from side to side and spread the slowly hardening
fluid around itself. This primary tube seemed to attatch securely to
the substrate at its anterior end and spread posteriorly until it
enclosed the tail. The larva then began to back into the sacklike
tube, stretching it posteriorly and withdrawing completely inside it.
The animal could be seen inside the tube, still rolling from side to
side and stretching out the walls by extending its thoracic setae,
Stretching continued until the tube was about 0.5 mm long and visibly
hardening.
About 10 minutes after settling, the body movements slowed, and
the worm extended its head out of the tube, assuming the adult posi¬
tion with the ventral eyespots away from the substrate. At this time,
the collar was first extended and folded down over the tube opening.
Periodic flexing movements ceased after another 5 minutes.
By this time, rudimentary tentacles were already large enough
to be seen with a dissecting microscope. Often, within minutes after
settling, the operculum had become clearly visible, indicating the
eventual coiling direction. After one or two days, the larval head
and eyespots could no longer be seen.
