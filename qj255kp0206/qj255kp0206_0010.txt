Spirorbid Larval Behavior

settling, and the two replicates that showed significant avoidance
of the algin solution may have been influenced by the same unknown
factor operating in the extract experiment.
Usually, in the present work, the larvae of more than one species
were tested simultaneously, yet no differences in response to filming,
position on the substrate, or settling behavior were noticed interÂ¬
specifically, with the exception that dextral and sinistral animals
settling together sometimes seemed to have different rates of secondary
tube growth. On intertidal rocks and shells at Hopkins and at
Pescadero Point, it appears that a number of species settle according
to identical or nearly identical criteria. The overlap of distributiions
is striking, especially in the low intertidal. In many areas, any
surface with more than a few spirorbids nearly always has a mixed
population, and it is not uncommon for a relatively small rock to
bear four intermingled species. Further settling experiments are
needed to help determine whether the apparent common preferences are
real.
SUMMARY
The settling behavior of spirorbid polychaete larvae from rocky
intertidal habitats on Monterey Peninsula was described, and settling
of larvae from mixed populations was shown to be promoted by the
presence of a suitable substrate bearing a film of microorganisms.
At least four species occupy rocks and shells in these areas,
including Pileolaria sensu and possibly Paradexiospira vitrea and
Spirorbis marioni.
