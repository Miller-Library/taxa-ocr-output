Spirorbid Larval Behavior
S. Jensen
Following formation of the primary tube, the much slower growth
of the adult tube would begin. Swan (1950) has shown that it is sec¬
reted by paired glands under the collar, and the collar probably
shapes the growing tube. In the first 24 hours, tubes grew anteriorly
about 0.25 mm then began to bend in the coiling direction.
Settling was watched both on rocks and on ceramic tiles, and no
differences in the sequence were apparent.
EXPERIMENTS ON LARVAL SETTLING
a) Detection of a film of microorganisms
Methods and Materials
To test substrate descrimination of settling spirorbid larvae,
groups of newly released larvae were placed with fresh seawater in
clean 12 cm crystallizing dishes and given choices between paired
identical surfaces (granite rocks or brick fragments) of about the
same size, one of which had been kept dry in the lab, while the other
had been kept for two days or more in running seawater and thus allowed
to develop a film of algae and bacteria. The larvae used in each dish
were obtained from a single rock. The dishes were incubated in the
dark either in a 6° C coldroom or in a 12° C running seawater bath,
and the surfaces were later examined under a dissecting microscope.
Only permanently attatched larvae that had begun metamorphosis were
counted as settled.
In another experiment, 20-30 larvae were pipetted into each of
six 50 ml beakers containing about 20 ml seawater. Half of the
beakers had been "filmed" for two days in running seawater, and half
were clean. All were incubated together at 12° C in the dark.
