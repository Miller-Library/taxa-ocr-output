"ho d intortidal distribution, alone with Graig's (1786)
obsorvations on fooding habits suggested that,since
tho differont forms woro ecting different algse, possibly
thero was ad
foronce in digestive enzymes in tho A. po
forms. The digestivo enzyme potentinl of the different
forms of A. pelta was assayod by moasuroment of roducing
sucar rolonsed from purified polysaccharides (Wolson, 10h4).
Tho polysaccharides studied woro fucoidin, laminarin, and
alginic acid from broun alcal sourcos, agar and K-carrageenin
Trom rod algao,and starch. Sinco somo of those carbohydrates
contain sulfated groups, particularly fucoidin, sodiu
hydroxide was substitutod for barium hydroxide (Wolson, 104)
to avoid possiblo precipitation of tho sulfatod sucar
fragmonts produced by onzymatic hydrolysis. A 10% exbract
of tho ontire digestive system including osophagus, buccal
selivary glands, and hind gut was propared from animals of
tho black and broum morphologie forms. Tho tissues woro chilled
on ico and homogenizod in ice cold homogenizing medium.
