JOBE, ALAN H. (Hopkins Marine Sta,, Stanford Univ., Pacific Grove,
Calif., USA). A study of morphological variation in the limpet Acmaea
pelta (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia). The Veliger
Populations of Acmaea pelta (Eschscholtz, 1833) on the
Monterey Peninsula, California exibit variation in shell shape and
color. Field studies showed possible correlations of these
variables with algal association, substrate, and exposure. Shell
shape seems to be dependent upon substrate and exposure. Shell
color may be related to diet, but preliminary investigations of
gut carbohydrases failed to reveal any distinctive guantitative
acwes
differences in the amylase, fucoidinase and alginase, found in
the A. pelta forms assayed.
