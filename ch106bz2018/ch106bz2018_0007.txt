Wach 1 ml of tissuo was homogonized in a modiu containing
o aa
us stroptomein solution (5 m/l) to inhibit
onctorial grouth, ! ml of a saturated solution of ovomucoid
isolated by tho mothod of Frodricg and Doutsch (1949), and
7 ml of buffor (0.21 Tris buffer at pü 7.2 and 0.2 acotste
buffor at oH 3.5). Ovomucoid was usod as a tryosin inhibitor
bocause of probloms oncountorod with protoinasos in tho
onzyme extract, ouho ovomcoid inerensod activity approximatoly
two-fold. Ono half ml of onaymo oxtract, one half ml of a
O.53 solution of purifiod polyseccharide ond one and ono half
for was incubatod at 2090 for ono hour. Tho amount
or bu
of polyseccharido in a ono nl aliquot was eqnivalent to
appromimatoly 200 micrograms of roducing aucar on complote
hydrolysis. Tho colorimetrie doterminations woro mado with
a Riott-Sumorson photo-oloctrie colorimeter uaing a green
rülter, and values were corrocted for roducine sugar prosent
in onzymo and substrato controls. Tho corroctod values are
exprossod in torms of mierograms of glucose por hour per ml
aliquet of rosction modium, and aro oquivalent to 0.02 ml of
