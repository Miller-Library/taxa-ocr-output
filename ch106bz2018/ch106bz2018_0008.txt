black form found on Pelvétia. Table 2 gives the quantitative
results. Higher act

from the
brown animals. Low levels of fucoidinase and alginase were
consistently demonstrable at pH 7.2. No enzymatic hydrolysis
of K-carrageenin, laminarin, or agar was observed at either
pH.
Disoussion
The field work demonstrated a differonce in shell shape

of the A. pelta found in dillerent habitats in the intertidal.
t appears that shell growth and the resulting shell shape is
robably a response to the substrate upon which the animal
ves. The high peaked convex shell of the black variet
ound in the mussel beds may be an adaption to attachment
to a substrate such as is presented in the mussel beds where
large flat surfaces are at a minimum. The flatter A. pelta
under Pelvétia have an excess of flat but rough rock surface
to grow and move on. The wavy shell periphery is an indication
of an adaption to this environment. This seems to be a
reaction to the substrate similar to but not as extreme as
that of the limpet A. scabra whose shell grows to conform
to irregularities of the home site (Hewatt, 1910). A.
