Acmaea pelta (Eschscholtz, 1833) is a low intertidal
species of limpet that is widely distributed on the American
west coast. A great variation in shell appearance has been
noted-Light,, especially when comparing large and
small specimens. Preliminary observations indicated a possible
correlation between habitat and morphology, which led to a
study of the distribution of A. pelta with respect to substrate
and algal association. These field studies, reported below.
indicated definite relationships between morphologic types
and habitat, leading to a study of digestive enzyme potential.
Field Studies
Field observations were done at Mussel Point, Pescadero
Point, and Cypress Point on the Monterey Peninsula,
California. Three morphologic forms of A. pelta were
observed, differing in color, shape, and length-to-height
ratios of the shell. These different forms of A. pelta
were positively identified as being variations of the
species using standard radula length and teeth determinations,
as well as the classification by jaw shape proposed
by Walker (1966). These various morphologic forms are described
below in terms of color, shell shape, and length-to-height
