ratios which varied with size, as seen in Table 1. No
specimens over 20 mm were found in the beds. The profile
of the members of this form (Fig. 1, Group D) approaches
that of the large brown A. pelta. The shells of this form
are not as clean and as shiny as those found under Pelvétia,
and the shell periphery is smooth.
Green form: The third group of A. pelta, intermediate
in size between the black A. pelta on Pelvétia and the
large brown A. pelta form, are shown in Fig. 1, Group B.
This group shows a great variation in shell shape and often
displays the growth ring type of change in the exterior shell.
Most specimens are greenish-black in color. Some, however.
are almost white and others are ribbed or checkered.
Kabitat.
A survey of the intertidal zone of the Monterey Peningila
revealed fifferences in the density of the k. pelta populationge.
Mussel Point and Pescadero Point had rich populations while
Point Pinos was sparcely populated. The reason for this
uneven distribution was not investigated.
Brown form: This form of A. pelta occupies a high inshore
intertidal position from  to above 16 feet. The brown
