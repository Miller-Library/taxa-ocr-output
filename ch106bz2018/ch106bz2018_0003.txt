Norohologic Formsien
Brown form: The typical large brown A. pelta is
rized by a convex slope from the high peaked shell
charate
apex to the periphery and is often infected with the fungus
1+oral
common to shells of diberg animals of the Pacific Coast
(Boner, 1936). These brown-colored specimens are generally
over 30 mmn in length, and have a length to height ratio of
2.3 as seen in Table 1. Illustrations of the brown shells
are in Fig. 1, Group A.
tia): Two separate populations of the
Black form (Pely
small black A. pelta were observed, on the mussel beds and
on and under Pelvåtia fastigata. Those found associated with
Pelwötia (Fig. 1, Group c) had a straight to concave slope
from the apex to edge and a characteristically cleaner shell
chan any other A. pelta form. The shell shape was flatter
than the brown 4. pelta, and had a uniform lengöh-to-height
ratio for the entire size range encountered. This flat
shell often had a rather hooked apex and a more wavy
peripheral edge than the black form seen in the mussel
beds (see below).
Black form (Mussel beds): A. pelta was found on the
mussel bed areas, generally on the mussels, Nytilus
tella
forianus, and on the goosenecked barnacles,

These were generally black with length-to-heigh
polymerus.
