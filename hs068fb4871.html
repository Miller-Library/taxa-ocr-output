The marine gastropod Crepidula perforans (Valenciennes,
1846) lives inside <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula funebralis : Exact'>Tegula funebralis</span> shells inhabited by her-
mit crabs <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus : Exact'>(Pagurus</span> species.) (See figure + 1.) It has also
been reported as living in rocks by Smith and Gordon (1948)
and by Coe (1949). While <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Crepidula adunca : Exact'>Crepidula adunca</span> Sowerby, a commen-
sal which lives on the outside of Tegula funebralis shells,
has been the subject of many studies (Coe, 1949; Moritz,
1938, 1939; Putnam, 1964; etc.,) little has been published a-
bout <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. perforans.</span> The present study was undertaken at the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove,
California, in April and May, 1965, to determine the distri-
bution of the mollusc and to investigate some aspects of the
relationship between the mollusc and the crustacean.
DISTRIBUTION AND NUMBERS
The survey of the Crepidula perforans population was done
in conjunction with a study of the Pagurus population of Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California by Robert Belknap and John
Markham. Thirteen samples were collected from the profiles
(see figure + 2) surveyed by Belknap and Markham (see Belknap
and Markham, 1965.) Each hermit crab shell was measured and
examined for presence of Crepidula perforans. The sex and spe-
cies of the crab, size and number of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Crepidula : Exact'>Crepidula,</span> type of shell,
and position of C. perforans on the shell were also noted.
The geographic distribution of Crepidula perforans was
-2-
found to vary markedly in closely associated areas. In hermit
crab shells large enough to contain C. perforans the infestation
usse
was quite high on one side of  Point of Hopkins Marine
Station, as it also was at nearby Point Pinos. On the other
side of  Point the number of infected crabs was much
lower. (See figure + 2.)
The size of the host shell has great bearing on the pre-
sence of C. perforans. No molluscs were found in Tegula fun-
ebralis shells less than O.25 inches in greatest diameter.
Other types of shells, such as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Thais emarginata : Exact'>Thais emarginata,</span> were considered
to be C. perforans-bearing size if they did not pass through
0.25 inch screening in the sizing process of the Pagurus sur-
vey/ (See Belknap and Markham, 1965.) Of 120 crabs smaller
than the minimum size, only one, a <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Calliostoma : Exact'>Calliostoma</span> shell, had a
Crepidula perforans on the outside. In crabs with shells great-
er than 0.25 inches in diameter infestation was quite high.
(See figure + 3.)
Crepidula perforans is not exclusively found in Tegula
funebralis shells. The 350 crabs of C. perforans-bearing size
inhabited 284 <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. funebralis</span> shells and 66 non-T. funebralis
shells (including 23 <span style='background-color:grey' title='Tegula brunnea : Fuzzy'>Tegula brunea</span> shells.) Of the latter,
22 or 33% contained C. perforans. No C. perforans were found
in unoccupied shells or in rocks in the course of this study.
Infestation by C. perforans of different species of Pag-
urus was also quite variable. 68% of <span style='background-color:grey' title='Pagurus hemphilli : Fuzzy'>Pagurus hemphilii</span> (n-33)
-3-
and 45.4% of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus samuelis : Exact'>Pagurus samuelis</span> (n-156) contained C. perforans
in contrast with <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus granosimanus : Exact'>Pagurus granosimanus</span> (n-144) which had 17.5%
infection and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus hirsutiusculus : Exact'>Pagurus hirsutiusculus</span> (n-17) which had 10.6%
infection (where n-total number of crabs examined.) The low
infestation of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. hirsutiusculus</span> is due in large part to the
smaller size of the species at maturity.
Within the host shell, distribution of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. perforans depends</span>
on several factors. The number of molluscs per shell depends
on crab size. The larger the crab, the more C. perforans it
is likely to possess. (See figure + 4.) The number of C. per-
forans in the shell depends also in large part on the size of
molluscs present in the shell. It is unusual to find two C.
perforans of egg-bearing size in a single shell, while a large
number of small ones are often found together or in association
with a large one. (See figure + 5.) The small number of large
molluscs may be due to mortality, to lack of room in the shell,
or toinhibiting factor produced by the large C. per-
forans. The mollusc is situated most often on the outside wall
of the bottom-most whorl of the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula : Exact'>Tegula</span> shell near its opening.
(See figure + 6.) In 40 animals examined, the head of the mol-
lusc always pointed toward the opening. This position of the
mollusc in the shell may have a great deal to do with its fil-
ter-feeding mechanism. The current which it creates for feed-
ing goes from left to right
and at-
4-
tachk to the side rather than the bottom of the shell may
facilitate feeding by causing water to flow from the top of
the shell to the bottom. (See figure + 7.) This position in
the shell might also be enforced by the hermit crab. Further
investigation of the currents of the C. perforans as they in-
teract with the currents of the hermit crab may clarify the
commensal relation of the two.
DISPERSAL
The uneven distribution of Crepidula perforans in the in-
tertidal may be due in part to complex physical factors which
were not investigated during this study. Instead this study
concentrated on biological aspects of the mollusc which may
account for the observation that two nearby areas may have wide
differences in C. perforans population. The behavior of the
young and the attraction behavior of C. perforans to hermit
crabs were examined to gain knowledge about the dispersal of
the molluscs.
In Crepidula adunca the young do not undergo a pelagic
stage. Upon hatching they are unable to attach to the shell
and are pushed off by the mother. Presumably the young live
somewhere in the intertidal until they are strong enough to
hold onto the shell/ (Putnam, 1964/), In Crepidula perforans,
which also does not have a pelagic stage, the behavior is some-
what different. To study the behavior of the young the mother
-5-
was removed from the shell exposing the egg capsule which was
torn open to hatch the young. The young were immediately able
to attach to the shell and remain on it. (See figure + 8.)
Their clinging ability may explain the uneven distribution of
the mollusc. If the young are able to stay in the shell, dis-
persal will not be effected in the same manner as in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. adunca.</span>
(See above.) Perhaps the C. perforans rarely leave the shell
they were born in or do so at a more advanced age than C. adunea.
Certainly the distribution of the mollusc indicates a dispersal
mechanism which is effective only over a small range. If in-
deed under natural situations the young are able to cling to
the shell some discrepancy is found in comparing the number of
eggs per mother and the number of C. perforans per shell. The
largest number of molluscs found on a single shell was 14, while
the average number of eggs per mother was 150. Somehow the
large excess must be gotten rid of, either by the crab or im
the mother.
The attraction of C. perforans to members of its own spe-
cies or to Pagurus is probably a very important factor in dis-
persal of the molluscs. Initial attempts to establish chemo-
taxis in C. perforans using glass dishes nine inches in diam-
eter with shells and/or hermit crabs placed at intervals along
the outer perimeter and C. perforans in the center were unsuc-
cessful due to the immobility of the mollusc. This very char-
acteristic may account in part for the animal's uneven distri-
bution. Certainly the mollusc with its small foot and contoured
shell could not traverse great distances to lodge in a hermit
crab, so experiments were set up to see if attraction could
be established over small distances. First ten C. perforans
were placed on the bottom of a small (4inch by 4 inch) plastic
dish inwwhich was also placed a crab or an empty shell. Be-
coming attached to the crab or shell was considered evidence
of attraction. In three instances out of seven trials C. per-
forans were able to attach toethe outside of a hermit crab mov-
ing about in the dish. In these instances the method by which
the C. perforans became attached to the shell was not observed
so a new set of experiments was devised. Small C. perforans
were placed 5 mm from stationary Pagurus and were observed for
two hour periods for signs of attraction. In two instances
out of six the mollusc was able to lift itself onto the out-
side of the shell and crawl to the inside. Attraction of small
C. perforans males to large females was also examined for in-
sight into dispersal. In C. adunca the young males are attracted
primarily to females rather than shells. (See Putnam, 1964,).
It was thought that this might also be true for C. perforans.
To test this hypothesis small males were placed 5 mm from a
large female and were observed for two hours for evidence of
attraction. No marked attraction of young males toward large
females was observed. The attraction of the small C. perforans
-7-
to <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurids : Exact'>Pagurids</span> was much more than the attraction to females,
even though in the field many times young were seen on top of
females. It thenet thet thes spssies of Cpeptdee is p-

. C. perforans did not seem to be attracted at all
to uninhabited Tegula funebralis shells. In no case were they
observed attached to uninhabited shells.
In addition to thetattraction of C. perforans to Pagurus
interactions among hermit crabs were investigated as possible
means of dispersal of C. perforans. A tank was set up contain-
ing ten unmarked hermit crabs with C. perforans and ten marked
Pagurus without them. Appearance of C. perforans in the
marked shell was looked for. Transfer of C. perforans
from a hermit crab bearing them to another hermit crab not hav-
ing them occurred once during a three week period. The means
of transfer is not known. However, the hermit crab might be
effective in dispersing the molluscs by carrying them on its
body when changing shells, by close contact occurring when
Pagurus are mating, or by close contact occurring when inact-
ive crabs are clustered together.
SUMMARY
Crepidula perforans (Valencienes, 1846), a gastropod liv-
ing inside hermit crab shells, is unevenly distributed in the area
of China Point at Hopkins Marine Station. The mollusc is not
found in shells less than 0.25 inches in diameter. It is most
often, though not always, found in Tegula funebralis shells.
The distribution of the mollusc in different species of Pagurus
is varied. The animal is situated in the outermost whorl of
the shell with its head fading the opening. The larger the
crab, the more C. perforans it is likely to have. The larger
the Crepidula inhabiting the shell, the fewer found in the
shell. The young molluscs are able to cling to the shell upon
hatching. C. perforans is attracted to Pagurus but not to mem-
bers of its own species or T. funebralis shells. The molluse
is able to move from one hermit crab to another.
