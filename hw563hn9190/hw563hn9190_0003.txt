Samples were all taken at low tide near the upper
intertidal limit of the brown alga Egregia. One hundred
Pagurus samuelis were taken from each study area. In the
laboratory, they were removed, without injury, from their
shells by removing the tip of the shell and poking the
crab out. When possible five pooled samples of males and
five pooled samples of females were tested from each area.
Among the females, only ovigerous individuals were used.
