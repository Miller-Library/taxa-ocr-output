INTRODUCTION
There is mounting evidence that human activity re-
sults in localized increases in the environmental levels
of trace metals such as Pb, Hg, Cd, and that such increases
are reflected in higher levels of these metals in organisms
(Patterson, 1965). In order to be able to detect such in-
creases, and to distinquish the effects of human activity
from normal background levels, baseline values must first
be determined in both environment and in representative
species. Hermit crabs of the genus Pagurus are abundant
and ubiquitous on Californian rocky shores and represent
forms that can be studied both in undisturbed regions and
in areas heavily influenced by man. Pagurus samuelis, a
species which lives higher in the intertidal than any
other hermit crab in Central California (Bollay, 1964), was
selected for study. It is more easily obtained than the
local edible crustaceans (eg. Cancer magister, the market
crab or Pandalus jordani, the ocean shrimp; see Frey, 1971).
Analyses were made of six metals (Ag, Cd. Cu, Mn, Pb. Zn).
Specimens from various locations were tested to determine
if the type of location correlates with changes in the
heavy metal concentrations of a Pagurus population.
Previous studies of trace metals in decapods are scanty.
Bowen (1966) lists the following concentrations for Crustacea
