and the eggs borne externally were removed before diges-
tion to assure a more uniform population. For each sam-
ple three individuals were pooled to insure adequate dry
weight. The individual crabs used ranged in size from
0.2 to 0.6 grams dry weight.
The method used for digesting the crabs is a modifi-
cation of the Middleton and Stuckey technique (Christian
and Feldman, 1970). Each sample was weighed wet and then
dried at least overnight at 80Â° C. It was then weighed
dry and pulverized with a ceramic mortar and pestle.
These and all all other glassware used had been previously
cleaned with 4-6 N HNO for 20 minutes. An aliquot (O.5-
0.6g.) of the powder was weighed out to 1.0000g. on a
Sartorius balance and placed in a 30 ml. beaker. To the
powder was added 6 to 8 ml. of 90% HNO3 (dropwise at
first). The beaker was then covered with a watchglass
and simmered, just under boiling, for one to three hours
until the organic matter was well broken down. The watch-
glass was removed and the solution allowed to evaporate
to approximately 4 ml. Four or five ml. of 30% H02 was
added (slowly to avoid bubbling over) and then heat was
applied for another 15 to 30 minutes. Whenever the solu-
tion was still cloudy the last two steps were repeated..
This resulted in a clear sample. Finally the solution
was diluted to 25 ml. with distilled water. At this
