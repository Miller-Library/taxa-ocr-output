point the solution was tested for Ag, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and
Zn with a Perkin-Elmer 303 Atomic Absorption Spectro-
photometer (Perkin-Elmer, 1968, 1971).
Many problems were incurred in attempting to get
reliable values for concentrations of lead. In all cases
the samples were measured at a wavelength of 285) which is
a very steady, easily readable line. Many of the samples
were also run at 218.5/, a line which fluctuated a great
deal on the a. a. spectrophotometer. In some instances
the machine could not be zeroed adequately and measurements
of the same sample taken two minutes apart differed radi-
cally. In the cases where measurements at 218.5 were
completed the concentration levels measured were about one-
third to one-half those measured at 285). Probably the
best assumption is that the true concentration value in
each lies somewhere between the two.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Concentrations of the six heavy metals considered are
shown in Table 1 and Figs. 2-6. The results show that
Pagurus samuelis ooncentrates the six metals to differing
degrees and that levels of occurrence varied with the loca-
tion. Significance of the differences between means of
the sample populations were determined with the Student's
t-test (Simpson, et. al., 1960). The graphs of Figs. 2-7
