SUMMARY
Amounts of Ag, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were measured
in the hermit crab Pagurus samuelis from eight locations
on the California coast between San Francisco and the
Palos Verdes Peninsula. Highest and lowest average
values obtained were: Ag (5.0-1.5), Cd (3.1-1.2).
Cu (200.7-44.6), Mn (24.2-6.5), Pb (23.4-14.8), and
Zn (108.8-76.4). Females did not differ significantly
from males for most metals in most areas. High levels of
zino and copper in Pagurus samuelis show some relation to
possible local sources in the environment.
