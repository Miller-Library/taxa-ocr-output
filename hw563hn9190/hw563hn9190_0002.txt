in general (in ppm dry animal tissue): Cd, O.15 ppm; Cu.
50 ppm; Mn, 2 ppm; Pb, 0.3 ppm; Zn, 200 ppm. Goldberg
(1967) cites a study in which the zinc level in a Texas
sample of the Blue crab Callinectes sapidus was determined
to be 46 ppm. In another instance he quotes that Cancer
pagurus has 35.0 ug/g (ppm) of Cu. It must be remembered,
however, that differences in concentration factors for a
given element in organisms exist among individuals and
species as well as among families (Goldberg, 1957).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pagurus samuelis were collected from eight areas on
the California coast between San Francisco and the Palos
Verdes Peninsula. (Fig. 1)
A) Pacificas latitude 37° 35'; near the San Pedro
Sewage Treatment Plant and outfall.
B) Monterey Harbor: latitude 36° 36', under Fisher-
man's Wharf, Monterey Harbor, and for about 100
meters northwest.
This area is within the Coast
Guard breakwater.
C) Mussel Point, Pacific Grove: latitude 36° 37
east of Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford Univer-
sity.
