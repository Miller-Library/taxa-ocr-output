Gopper (Eig.2
While oopper is essential to all organisms, abnor-
mally high levels may be highly toxic to invertebrates
and moderately toxic to mammals (Bowen, 1966). Pagurus
contains copper in its hemocyanin. Levels of Cu obtained
at Carmel Mission Point, Monastery Beach, and Malpaso
Creek were statistically similar and were the lowest.
If this level is accepted as a general indication of the
level necessary for Pagurus samuelis, then the other val-
ues are much in excess of this. White's Point and the
Monterey Harbor were not significantly different and showed
the highest levels; with Mussel Point not far below.
Pacifica and Point Pinos showed intermediate levels of
Cu that were still very high. The high levels at Mussel
Point and Monterey Harbor are probably affected by the
effluent from the Monterey Sewage Treatment Plant, which
on May, 1971 contained about 2500 grams/day of copper
(Vieth, 1971).. Also copper is contained in the anti-
fouling paiht used for many boat hulls. Some of the cop-
per found may represent the local use of fungicides con-
taining Cu and the use of copper sulfate to control fresh-
water algae.
