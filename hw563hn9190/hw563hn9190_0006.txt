are based on the data of Table 1.
The females were compared to the males at each loca-
tion (Figs. 8 & 9).. In most cases the differences be-
tween sexes were not statistically significant.
Lead (Fig, 2)
Lead acts as a cumulative poison in mammals where it
is moderately toxic (Bowen, 1966). While absolute values
are to be regarded as approximate the relative amounts at
the various locations are probabCly reliable. The Mussel
Point and Monterey Harbor samples are not significantly
different; however, the Mussel Point results differ signi-
ficantly from those at the remaining six locations, which
are similar.
Cadmium (Fig. 3)
Cadmium is a cumulative poison in mammals and moderately
toxic to all organisms (Bowen, 1966). Mean levels of Cd
in P. samuelis were highest at Pacifica, and (contrary to
expectations) lowest at White's Point. The latter was
significantly lower than all the others at the,Ol level.
Cadmium may precipitate readily and the Los Angeles out-
fall is a mile offshore with another mile of diffuser pipe
beyond that. It may be that the Cd is precipitating out
before reaching the intertidal zone.
