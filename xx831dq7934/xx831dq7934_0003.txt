Control of Movement in a Chiton
Effects of Light, Turbulence, Temperature
and Water Level on Movement
Methods. Five aquaria, each containing 5 Mopalia muscosa, were
placed in darkrooms equipped with running sea water. In each tank, 3
of the chitons were freshly collected, and the other 2 had been in the
laboratory 1 to 2 weeks. Individual animals were not marked, but were
recognized'by size and adhering algal cover. Each aquarium was held
under a different set of test conditions for a period of 12 hours, as
shown in Fig. 1, and explained below. Tanks A, B, and D were held in
the same darkroom, while Tanks C and E were isolated in separate dark-
rooms.
At the start of the experiment and every 30 minutes thereafter,
the position of the center or midpoint of the animal was established
to the nearest centimeter. The straight-line distance between consecuÂ¬
tive midpoint positions was calculated and recorded as the distance
moved (net displacement) per hour. Observations under dark conditions
were made with a flashlight covered with a red filter, to which the
chitons appeared to give no response.
Results and Discussion. The control animals in Tank A (Fig. 1-A)
held at constant darkness, temperature, and turbulence, showed little
movement. Small peaks of activity were noted which (unfortunately)
occurred when conditions were changed in other tanks. Since the control
was held in the same room with Tanks B and D, the manipulations carried
out on these other tanks may have altered the noise level or some other
