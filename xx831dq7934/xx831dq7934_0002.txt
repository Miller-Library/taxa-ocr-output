Control of Movement in a Chiton
Introduction
The chiton Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846) is flexible in habit
and habitat. In the present study on the Monterey Peninsula, California.
M. muscosa was found at low tide (1) in permanent tide pools, (2) attached
to the undersides of large rocks in sand with Mopalia lignosa (Gould, 1846).
(3) in the midst of tight clusters of the sea anemone, Anthopleura
elegantissima (Brandt, 1835), (4) in the shade of various macroscopic
algae, (5) in bare rock crevices with only microscopic and crustose
algae, and (6) on exposed surfaces where their shells are often bleached
white by the sun. Barnawell (1954) notes that M. muscosa is one of the
few species of Mopalia that can do well in the estuarine conditions of
San Francisco Bay. This variety of habitats implies behavioral flexi-
bility as well as wide physiological tolerances.
Field observations by Smith (1975), myself, and others indicate
that Mopalia muscosa moves mostly at high tide and at night. In an
observation which led to the present research, chitons in a high tide
pool began to move at sunset. At the same time, a rising tide splashed
the tide pool with waves, and the water temperature dropped rapidly from
24°C. to 15°C. The chitons may have begun to move in response to the
onset of darkness, the disturbance of the pool by wave splash, the lowered
temperature, or an endogenous cycle. A series of experiments was planned
to determine the effect of each stimulus isolated from the rest. All work
was carried out at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University during
the period April-June, 1974.
