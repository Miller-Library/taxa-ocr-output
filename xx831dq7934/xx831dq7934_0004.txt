Control of Movement in a Chiton
factor in the room to cause these small activity peaks. It is also
possible that these were random fluctuations.
The animals in Tank B, subjected to varying turbulence (Fig. 1-B)
showed no obvious response to this gentle stimulus.
In Tank C, exposed to alternate periods of light and darkness
(Fig. 7-C), there was less movement during light than during dark
periods; and the first onset of a dark period was accompanied by a
sharp increase in activity.
In Tank D, (Fig. ]-D) the animals responded to a falling water
level by moving down the sides of the tank, keeping half susmerged until
they reached the bottom. Although the aquarium bottom remained wet
during the artificial low tides, the chitons moved very little until
the "tide" rose again.
Animals kept in Tank E with a temperature cycle (Fig. 1-E) showed
increased activity at the onset of each change.
The results indicate that movement may be stimulated by decreases
in incident light, or by a change in water temperature or water level.
Endogenous Rhythms

be stimulated by some exogenous factors; thepossibilityofanexogenous
rhythm remains unerplored.â€”To examine-this-questien, the following
