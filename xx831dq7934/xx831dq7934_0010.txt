trends by connecting averages of adjacent data points. A. In this the
control, nothing was varied. Sea water circulated at 14°C., the tank
was kept full, and the room was kept dark. These were also the conditions
in the other tanks, except for those that were varied, as explained below
and shown above each of the other activity graphs. B. Tha gently turbulent
flow of sea water was stopped or restarted every 3 hours. Temperature
change was minimal. C. Cool bright overhead flourescent lights were
turned on or off every 3 hours. D. The tank was alternately drained or
refilled every 3 hours. The tank took about 1 hour to refill and 1.5 hours
to drain. During the 3 hour filling period, the water was kept flowing,
but during the draining period, the water was shut off. Therefore a small
temperature cycle probably accompanied the "tidal" cycle. E. The incoming
stream of water was changed from a source at 14°C. to a source at 25°C. or
back again every 3 hours. After 1.5 hours, the temperature of the tank
was within 1"C. of the incoming water temperature.
