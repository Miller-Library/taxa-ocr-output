Control of Movement in a Chiton
Methods. Eight chitons from low tide pools and 8 from other
habitats were collected and placed in aquaria equipped with running sea
water at 14Â°C. in constant darkness. Animals ranged in length from 5 to
9 cm. Subsequet Observations were made with the aid of a dim red light.
The position of the midpoint of each chiton was checked every 45 minutes
.
over a 25 hour period;after the chitons had been in the aquaria .5, 3, 13
and 19 days. Movement (net displacement) was recorded as in the previous
experiment.
Results and Discussion. Fig. 2-A shows the total activity of
all 16 animals for a 25 hour period starting 12 hours after they were
placed in aquaria. Minimum activity, corresponding to actual lower low
tide, is followed immediately by an increase in activity. After 3 days
in the tank (Fig. 2-B), a sharp increase in activity of the animals
still corresponds to the rising tide following the lower low tide, but
there is less overall activity. After 13 days (Fig. 2-C) activity is
again low during the lower low tide and the overall activity is again
high. No tidal cycle is clearly resolvable after 19 days in the tanks
(Fig. 2-D). The results obtained are very suggestive of a tidal rhythm
of movement. The lull in activity at low tide periods coincides with
the field observations of Smith (1975) who found that Mopalia muscosa
that were uncovered by the tide had already "homed", while other animals
slightly lower in the intertidal that were not going to be exposed did
not home, but did reduce their movement. Activity was greatest during
