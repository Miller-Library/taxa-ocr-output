Phototaxis and a tidal rhythm
Abstract
Under high intensity fluorescent light, the intertidal
chiton, Mopalia muscosa was shown to be negatively phototactic
when left 43 to 27 hours. Chitons seemed to respond to tide both
exogenously and endogenously by reduction of movement. The
suggested tidal rhythm appears to be the mechanism by which these
chitons may predict the heighths of low tides. The rhythm appears
to have been rephased by a single artificial low tide of 10 to 45
minutes. Diurnal movement patterns appear to be exogenous.
