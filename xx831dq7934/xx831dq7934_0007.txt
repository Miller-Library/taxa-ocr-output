Control of Movement in a Chiton
Summary
(1) Mopalia muscosa appears to be exogenously stimulated to move
by decreases in incident light, or by a change in water temperature or
water level.
(2) M. muscosa responds to an artificially lowered water level
by moving down, staying half submerged. The chitons move very little
in an empty tank until it is refilled.
(3) M. muscosa shows evidence of an endogenous tidal rhythm in
their movement. Under constant aquarium conditions, they move less at
times corresponding to low tide, especially the lower low tide, and
they move much more soon after.
(4) M. muscosa under constant aquarium conditions shows more
overall movement and clearer tidal cycles during spring tides. The
same monthly cycl√© may enable them to predict the heights of low tides.
(5) No endogenous diurnal activity pattern was detected.
