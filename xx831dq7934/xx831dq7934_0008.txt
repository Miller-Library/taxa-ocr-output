I would like to thank and acknowledge the help of: Dr. Robin
Burnett, who advised me during this study and the writing of this paper:
David W. Phillips, who gave advice and loaned equipment; Dr. W. G. Evans.
who advised and encouraged me to study tidal rhythms; and Margaret
Westersund, my wife, who worked with me observing chitons at all hours.
