There should be no surprise to find a daily rhythm in the
photosynthetic capacity of the red alga. Insufficient data
are available to call this particular rhythm circadian,
but circadian rhythms have been demonstrated in many plants
(as mentioned in the introduction). When plotted in con-
junction with tidal and daylight cycles though, the variations
take on an interesting perspective. The highest rates of gas
production match times when the tides are lowest. As mean
tide level climbs, the photosynthetic capacity declines.
This phenomenon may be related to the position of Smithora
on its seagrass host. The alga is found on distal portions
of Phyllospadix. At high tide periods both host and epiphyte
tend to lay well below the water's surface. During low tide
Phyllospadix is often exposed to the air. However, epiphytic
Smithora, because of its position on the host, usually floats
just on the surface. Only during extreme low tides is
Smithora ever exposed to air. While floating at the surface
during low tides, the alga receives a maximum amount of
light. It would be sound biological strategy for the alga
to peak in its photosynthetic potential at these times. This
is just what I observed. Finally, as the available sunlight
declines during the day, the photosynthetic activity of
Smithora drops also, preserving production energy for better
conditions.
The conclusions drawn above should be read with care.
Photosynthetic measurements are tremendously variable. In
