order to standardize measurements, equal area sections of the
alga were required. These could only be taken from the blades
of Smithora. Presumably these structures possess the major
photosynthetic apparatus in the mature algal specimens.
Additionally, the procedure required that the largest blades
of the alga be used. This may have biased my results to some
extent. Finally, the season of the year could have a critical
influence on the capacity for production of photosynthetic
metabolites. One might expect higher rates would be measured
in the Spring and Fall than in other seasons. The importance
of these considerations (portion of plant used, age of samples,
season) has been recently demonstrated by Littler and Arnold (1980)
and deserves to be kept in mind whenever data on photosynthetic
production is considered.
SUMMARY
I have attempted to demonstrate a few physiological
implications of the symbiosis between the epiphyte Smithora
The
naiadum and its natural host Phyllospadix torreyi.
information which I have presented includes:
1. The spore bundles of the algae show a settling
preference for the host over several other organic and inorganic
substrates. This would be important for host location and to
insure survival of the species.
2. A dye was absorbed through the roots and rhizomes of
the seagrass but showed negligible rates of translocation.
This information leads one to conclude that nutrients are more
likely taken up by all surfaces of the plant and used mainly
where they are absorbed.
3. Carbohydrates may be leached out by the seagrass and
