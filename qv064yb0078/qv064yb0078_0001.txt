ABSTRACT
Spore packets from Smithora naiadum (Anderson)
Hollenberg were shown to settle preferentially on its
natural host Phyllospadix torreyi (S. Wats.) over several
other natural and artificial substrates.
Flourescein dye was introduced to both intact and
rhizome-severed basal portions of Phyllospadix blades but
showed little translocation beyond point of entry. This
dispelled the possibility of distant translocation of
nutrients through Phyllospadix and into its epiphytes.
An attempt to qualitatively determine if Smithora
receives biochemical communicants from its seagrass host
yielded no such products. A possible procedure for approaching
the question was developed though.
A possible circadian variation in photosynthetic rate
in the red alga Smithora was demonstrated.
INTRODUCTION
The red alga Smithora naiadum has been only described
growing on two closely-related seagrasses, Phyllospadix
torreyi and Zostera marina L. (Hollenberg, 1959). Harlin
(1973a) reported culturing immature Smithora on a synthetic
seagrass, "Olefern," but reproductive maturity was reached
on natural hosts alone (Harlin, 1973b).
Harlin (1973b) further demonstrated the movement of
labelled carbon from seagrass host to Smithora epiphyte
in culture. Possibly the red alga receives some nutrients
or a biochemical developmental cue from its host. This
"messenger" might well be derived from the host's photo-
synthetic process. Sugars have been found to be passed
