ocean temperature of 12Â°0; shaking speed was 3. Lights for
photosynthesis were partially shielded by mesh screens to
exaggerate periodic fluctuations in the potentials; intensity
was 60 pEin/m/s.
Net change in oxygen within each reaction vessel was
measured at fifteen minute intervals for approximately two
and a half hours. The runs were stopped after two successive
readings showed significantly reduced gas production as
compared to earlier measurements. Mean oxygen production
as ul/15 min. was calculated for each replicate. A single
mean value was obtained for each time interval (6:00 A.M..
10:00 A.M., 2:00 P.M., etc.). These numbers are plotted in
Figure 5 along with daily light-dark cycle and tidal cycle
for comparison.
ESULT
Smithora showed a pronounced, regular variation in
photosynthetic capacity over 24 hour periods. The alga
produced oxygen at a maximum rate in early morning. The rate
drops during daylight hours and then climbs again during
the night. There was a 25% difference between maximum and
minimum production rates in the first trial (samples collected
from the field for each time run). An overall change of 10%
was observed for the second run (algal collection kept in
controlled conditions for the duration of the experiment).
Controls showed negligible changes in gas within their
vessels, never producing nor consuming more than 1 ul of gas
during any 15 minute period. Because of this insignificant
rate as compared to those measured for Smithora in light, the
controls were discontinued for the latter half of the second
run. They do not appear on Figure 5. No measurement was made
