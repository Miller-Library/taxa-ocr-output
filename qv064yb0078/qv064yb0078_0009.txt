The leaching experiment was conducted for five days.
Water in the two collection vessels was continuously agitated
by magnetic stirrers. The plant was exposed to 125 pEin/m/s
on a light-dark cycle which approximated the normal daylight.
Air-exposed seagrass parts were wrapped in plastic to reduce
desiccation. The baths were kept at about 11 C.
At the end of the experimental period the two collection
solutions were filtered to remove all debris; centrifuged
samples from each vessel showed no particulate impurities,
so 600 ml. of fluid was poured off of each one. In a control
experiment both active and control were spotted on paper
chromatograms to check for the presence of carbohydrates.
The solvent system used was n-butanol/ethanol/water (40:11:19);
ammoniacal silver nitrate was sprayed on finished chromatograms
to reveal any sugars (Benson, et al, 1950; Heftmann, 1967).
For the final run the control aliquot was refrigerated while
the active sample was lyophilized. The dried salts from
the active chamber were then stored in a desiccator while the
control was freeze-dried. Drying of both samples took five
days.
The next step in the analysis involved separating minute
amounts of photosynthates presumably released by the seagrass
from the large mass of sea salts to allow concentration of
the organic fraction. Carbohydrates and inorganic salts
share similar solubilities in most solvents, complicating
separation. A trimethysilyl (TMS) ether formation promised
to be the easiest to prepare and the most stable (Hammarstrand,
1968; Szymanski, 1968; Holligan & Drew, 1971). Derivative
preparation involved replacing the sugars' hydroxy groups
