from autotroph to parasite (Smith, et al, 1969). Other
plants have been demonstrated to leach photosynthetic
products, some of which are subsequently reabsorbed (Tukey,
1970; Tukey & Mechlenburg, 1964). Brown algae actually
absorb sugars from their environment which are later
processed by the plant (Drew, 1969). Penhale and Smith
(1977) found that Zostera released photosynthates into
surrounding water and suggested that these products might
be used for nutrition by the adjacent epiphytic community.
Electronmicroscopy has shown there are no cytoplasmic
connections between the laminae of the host seagrass and
the rhizoids of the alga (McBride & Cole, 1969). Seagrass
release, followed by algal reabsorbtion, presents itself
as a candidate for the Smithora-Phyllospadix association.
My investigations were aimed at helping to explain the
alga's host specificity through nutritional requirements.
In addition other experiments were also directed
towards clarifying the symbiosis. Spore settling studies
followed substrate preferences of the loosed marginal sori
(spore packets). Daily tests were conducted to see if
the algal sori preferentially land on their natural hosts
or if random chance alone dictates where the spore bundles
settle. Dye movement in the seagrass was examined as a
possible indicator of nutrient flow between host and epi-
phyte. Final experiments measured photosynthetic activity
of the red alga over 24 hour periods to further describe
Smithora itself. Circadian cycles, demonstrated in innu-
merable plant and animal species, have received sparse
attention in the algae until recently. Daily variation
