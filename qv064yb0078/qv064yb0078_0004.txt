be counted. Each substrate strip was examined with a
hand lens, and a record was made of the number of packets
which had settled on it. The strips were then cleaned
or replaced before the frame was returned to the field.

RESUDI
Figure 2 shows the results of four runs. The
Phyllospadix had a far greater number of spores land and
attach than other substrates tested. The figures vary
from one day to the next but are consistent for each day.
All figures are lower estimates because spores which had
landed on other spores could not be resolved. During the
study it was observed that spore packets will wash off
most substrates on which they settled except Phyllospadix.
SION
This experiment showed a marked spore preference for
attachment to Smithora's natural host (Phyllospadix) over
several other substrates, whether natural or synthetic.
This phenomenon may be a derivative of the obligate rela-
tionship between the seagrass and the alga.
Smithora may
be bound by some sticky, mucus-like substance on the
Phyllospadix. Extracts of the seagrass, coated on glass
rods, could be used to test this possibility.
The frame received exposure to a full range of tides
during the experiment. Some mornings the apparatus lay
fully exposed. At other times it was submerged beneath
three feet of water. These widely variable circumstances
serve to substantiate results obtained rather than to com-
plicate them. The data represents full exposure to tide
fluctuations. These are the conditions under which sori
will encounter their host seagrass as well as other substrates.
