lactuca, and seasonal variations above and beyond the
daily one were also discovered (Mishkind, et al, 1979).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A special frame was built from 1 by 2 redwood with
central horizontal strips to sandwich the substrates under
examination (Figure 1). Phyllospadix, another sea plant
Gracilaria, and a land plant of the cat-tail family Typha
sp. were the organic substrates chosen. Rubber and glass
were also tested. The substrates were prepared as thin
strips to resemble the Smithora's natural hosts. Yellow
flags attached to vertical posts facilitated location
of the apparatus during high tides.
The frame was freshly prepared with the substrates
each morning for four consecutive days. Phyllospadix was
cleaned of all epiphytes before being inserted; other
substrates were examined to remove any blotches which
might later be confused with algal spores. Four strips
of each substrate served as replicates for each trial.
The frame was tied to stakes in the lower intertidal such
that it would remain submerged for all but the lowest
tides. The tie stakes were planted adjacent to densely
Smithora-covered Phyllospadix to insure availability of
algal sori.
The apparatus remained in the field for 24 hour inter-
vals. At the time of collection it was removed from the
stakes and brought into the lab where spore packets could
