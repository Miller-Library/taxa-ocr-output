hydrogens with TMS groups. The appropriate reagent Sigma Sil-A
(Sigma Chemical Co.) is a mixture of trimethylchlorosilane,
hexamethyldisilazane, and pyridine (1:3:9).
To each dry salt sample (active and control) 5 ml. of
TMS reagent was added under nitrogen, following the directions
supplied with the reagent. The major obstacle at this point
was that the instructions recommended O.1 ml. reagent be
used for each 1 mg. of sample. Because the reactant sugars
were in a mixture with sea salts, it was impossible to know
beforehand the concentration of sugars in each sample.
Thus an anticipated excess of reagent was used.
After two hours the reaction mixture was placed in 10 ml.
of pesticide-grade hexane and vigorously shaken. The hexane
would dissolve the sugars-turned-ethers; inorganic salts are
insoluble in hexane. The solution was decanted to isolate
organic fractions from salts. The liquid was placed on dry
ice and taken to Stanford's main campus. The next morning
10 ul aliquots of the hexane-soluble components of both active
and control solutions were to be gas chromatographed.
LTS
Paper chromatograms from the dry run developed poorly.
Only random splotches appeared on them.
The gas chromatogram of the active sample leachate
derivative showed no peaks beyond those of standard background
noise. The control was not processed because of the poor
showing of the primary sample and because of the prohibitive
cost of G.C. analysis.
DISCUSSION
Harlin's data suggest that there is some type of biochemical
