communication between host and epiphyte of the Smithora-
Phyllospadix complex (Harlin, 1973b). The preceding experiment
supposed the most likely candidates for such a transfer
would be carbohydrates. The primary suspects (fructose.
sucrose, and an unidentified trisaccharide) were described
by Drew data as the major free sugars of Phyllospadix leaves
(Phillips & McRoy, 1980). I was unable to demonstrate that
these or any other sugars are leached by the seagrass. This
result most certainly doesn't serve to discount the hypothesis
of a chemical messenger, nor does it discount sugars'
involvement. If present, sugars may have been in minute
concentrations, undetectable by the procedure which was
followed. The TMS reagent could have been absorbed by the
much greater mass of salts present in the mixture. Reagent
concentration may have been diluted beyond reactive and
detectable levels.
Time constraints prevented repetition of this experiment.
Should the general procedure be repeated, a more effective
method should be sought for separating the salts from the
suspected leachates. Radioactive carbon labelling also
presents itself as a useful tool for identifying the leachates.
Labelled compounds could be followed closely during many
phases of the separation and analysis. Aside from sugars.
other organic products are possible candidates for passing
from seagrass to Smithora. These may serve as nutrients for
epiphytes or in the capacity of hormone-like signals for
induction of algal maturation. The identification of such
transferred leachates should be actively pursued; this effort
would contribute much towards elucidating the precise nature
of the Smithora-Phyllospadix association.
