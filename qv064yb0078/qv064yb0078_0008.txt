roots. Experiments indicate otherwise however, showing
negligible 'C uptake by roots or rhizomes when compared
"C absorbed through the leaves (Barbour & Radosevich,
1979).
Lateral sections of dyed Phyllospadix showed the dye
tended to travel by way of three air canals of the lamina,
probably by diffusion. These canals extend the length of
the leaf and may play a role in gas transport in the plant.
These tubes are sealed at the tip. When blades were severed
at both ends they acted as siphons. Water was observed to
move from a high reservoir to a lowerone via the blades.
This activity explains the near complete transfer of dye
through the broken, root-severed laminae. Most likely
though this activity doesn't reflect on any life-preserving
function in the real world.
LEACHATE ANALYSIS
An experiment was run to isolate and identify carbo-
hydrates released by Phyllospadix into surrounding water.
Later experiments would be aimed at demonstrating uptake of
these sugars by the epiphytic community, if these nutrients
could be located.

MATERIALS AND !
A portion of Phyllospadix was uprooted and transferred
with seawater into the lab. The plant was rinsed in fresh
water to remove microorganisms; all visible epiphytes were
removed. The plant was inserted into the apparatus shown in
Figure 4. The collection container into which the seagrass
ran was called "active;" the other, "control." Each contained
900 ml. of 0.22 um filtered "Instant Ocean.'
