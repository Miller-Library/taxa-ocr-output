The liquid in the dyeing vessel was 12 cm. deep; these blades
had a mean dyed distance of 13 cm., both for sections with
and without root structures.
Broken strands of Phyllospadix (torn at the distal
leaf tip) showed much greater dye transfer. In the sample
clump which retained its root complex the dye moved an
average of 23 cm. beyond the surface of the coloring solution.
Most notable were the strands severed at both ends. These
laminae moved the dye an average of 12 cm. or 98% of the
average total length of all blades.
ISCUSSION
While many marine plants have been described that absorb
nutrients through their root systems (McRoy & Goering, 1974),
this mode of action is apparently not significant for
Phyllospadix. Experiments on closely-related Zostera showed
good uptake of, but minor subsequent movement of either
"CO or 3P through the root-rhizome system (Penhale & Thayer.
1980). The absence of flourescein movement beyond the surface
of the dye suggests that Phyllospadix used an alternate method
of nutrient absorption as well. One might expect some residual
level of root uptake since seagrasses are submerged vascular
plants. However, it seems that as the sea permits the entire
plant to be bathed in a nutrient broth, absorption via the
entire leaf surface is a more efficient and effective way
for the seagrass to "feed." Nutrient translocation after
absorption by the root system would be minimized, as observed.
The results of the dye movement studies cannot be considered
absolutely conclusive. The flourescein molecule is larger
than many inorganic nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous.
These smaller molecules may be more easily absorbed by the
