out the procedure the plants were submerged in ambient
seawater.
The basal ends of both seagrass portions were inserted
into a concentrated flourescein-seawater solution (Figure 3).
The blades were put into plain seawater. Tissue was draped
over the air-exposed sections to prevent drying out and
to prevent the dye from carrying from one vessel to the
other across the Phyllospadix's surface. The plants were
kept in the dye for four hours. Previous dry runs had
shown longer exposures (up to 24 hours) to have negligible
effect on the results of the experiment. The plant was
exposed to light of intensity 13 pEin/m/s for the duration
of the experiment. The baths varied in temperature from
17°C to 21°c.
After the set interval the plants were removed from
the apparatus and immediately washed in fresh water to
remove dye from their exterior. They were then laid out
on moist paper in a dark room. The plants were sectioned
into 5 cm. lengths to prevent further dye movement and to
simplify subsequent measurements. An ultraviolet lamp
(UVSL 25 Mineralight) was used to determine the longitudinal
distance the dye had penetrated each Phyllospadix blade.
Also, the total length of each blade was measured. Finally
a notation was made as to whether a particular blade was
intact (designated normal) or had been torn at its distal
end (broken).
SULTS
Table I summarizes the results of the simulated nutrient
movement. Little translocation of dye beyond the surface
of the flourescein solution was observed for normal blades.
