CYCLIC VARIATION IN SMITHORA PHOTOSYNTI
STIC POTENTIAL
The photosynthetic capacity of the red alga was monitored
over two 24 hour periods. The results were correlated with
natural light availability and tides. Possible relations
between the data and the symbiosis under consideration were
proposed.

ERIALS AND METHODS
The first half of this experiment consisted of the per-
iodic collection of heavily colonized Phyllospadix at four
hour intervals for a 24 hour period. Sections of Smithora
were removed, and the alga's photosynthetic capacity at that
particular time was measured. The second half of the exper-
iment was conducted two days later and differed in that a
large amount of epiphytized seagrass was collected at one
time (6:30 A.M.). Again the photosynthetic activity of the
alga was monitored at four hour intervals for one day. Smithora
not being tested at a particular time was kept intact on its
host in seawater at 12Â°0 with a light-dark regime to match
the natural diurnal one.
Photosynthetic rates of the epiphyte were measured on
a Gilson Differential Respirometer. Slices 1.2 cm in area
were made of Smithora blades. Six such sections were placed
in each reaction vessel with 6 ml. of filtered seawater.
0.75 ml. of 0.035 M KHCO,/0.065 M NaHCO, buffer solution was
placed in the flasks' sidearms to maintain a constant pressure
of CO gas. Five replicates were run for each time period.
along with a dark control (flask prepared as above but covered
with black plastic) and a plain seawater control.
Respirometer vessels were equilibrated for 30 minutes
prior to each run. The respirometer bath was held at ambient
