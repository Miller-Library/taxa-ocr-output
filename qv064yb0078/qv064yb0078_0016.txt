ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
My sincere thanks go to the entire faculty and staff
at H.M.S. for their friendship and support this quarter.
These fine people bring to Hopkins a warm, receptive
stimulating climate for research and learning. Special
thanks go to three people for guiding me along through
the quarter. Dr. Robin Burnett, Dr.-to-be Celia Smith, and
Dr. Isabella Abbott provided me with inspiration and insight.
And in the end I have to thank Kimberly too, for she kept
my spirit buoyed as it bobbed up and down with the tides.
