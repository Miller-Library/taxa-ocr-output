While settling data from one day to the next may not be
compared quantitatively, the relative magnitudes of settling
within each trial, a qualitative demonstration of host
binding preference, stands up consistently. Thus I may
say that in the ocean the spores tend to attach to Phyllo-
spadix rather than to an old bottle or stray Gracilaria
strand.
That Smithora has a much greater binding rate to its
host makes for a survival rate higher than chance landings
alone. If there is a real physiological requirement,
provided by seagrasses, for Smithora to mature, then a
distinct preference for spores to settle on that host is
a tremendous reproductive advantage. Particularly in the
marine environment, where continual water motion is a rule,
a true binding capacity of symbiote for its host is beneficial.
NUTRIENT TRANSLOCATION
The possibility that nutrients are absorbed through
the roots of Phyllospadix and move up through the rhizome
structure into the blades, as a prerequisite for transfer
directly to the epiphytes, was examined.

TERIALS AND M
THODS
A patch of the seagrass, lightly colonized, was uprooted
and rinsed in seawater to remove debris and detritus from
the intact root-rhizome system. Large blades of Smithora
which might interfere with dye position determination were
cut from the seagrass's laminae. The plants were divided
into two similar clumps for parallel studies. One half
had roots and rhizomes severed near the proximal portion
of their sheathes; the other clump remained uncut. Through-
