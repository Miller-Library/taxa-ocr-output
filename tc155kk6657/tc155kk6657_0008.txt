surface is covered with an exoskeleton of presumed low
permeability (Fisher and Bassett 1976) and shows no obvious
areas of morphological specialization for exchange.
If the gut fluid is isosmotic with the environment
and it makes up a significant portion of the total body
fluid measured, the hemolymph and other internal body fluid
must be at a different concentration than the values obtained
during regulation. A corrected value for real body fluid
may be obtainable. Gut volume and total water content
(from dessication experiments) used to estimate real body
fluid volume would be a good place to start. The concentration
of the body fluid could then be calculated using the gut
volume change in torpor.
In trial one the onset of regulation occurys sooner
than it does in trial two. Trial two was acclimated for
nine hours longer which suggests that Tigriopus when given
a longer acclimation period may tolerate a broader range
of salinities without regulation. This must be tested with
longer and shorter acclimation periods.
Measurement of O, consumption at various salinities
shows a respiratory pattern similar to that of most euryhaline
species (Prosser 1973). Metabolism is high at low salinities
and decreases as salinity increases. The line appears to
be fairly level between 35 and 60 0/00 which coincides
with the conforming zone - no metabolic change in response
to salinity change. There was no monitoring of activity
or other metabolic changes that may occur with salinity
variation (Lockwood from Newell 1976), therefore O, consumption
