intracellular environment against ionic change by adjusting
the amino acid concentrations. Regulating animals do so
over a range of salinities, and show conformance on either
side. The arthropod Artemia, like Tigriopus, is exposed to
large variations in osmotic pressure. Their response is
to regulate their body fluid at a relatively constart level,
markedly hypotonic to all except the lowest salinities
(Croghan 1958). Tigriopus' osmotic behavior is unusual
but highly adaptive to its habitat - high tidepools of constantly
changing salinities, and hence changing osmotic pressures,
as a result of the interaction between weather, tides and
high waves. Most salinities are between 30 and 60 0/00
but pools are commonly found substantially beyond these
values on both sides.
Tigriopus were found to conform between salinities
25 and 60 0/00 which corresponds to the usual tide pool
salinities. Since regulation requires energy, it is adaptive
for Tigriopus to conform to the common fluctuations in salinity.
Outside of the conforming range, Tigriopus regulate their
body fluid until a state of torpor is induced. This greatly
inhances Tigriopus' ability to survive in their tidepool
habitat, which often exceeds the salinity levels over which
they conform. The state of torpor, induced by extreme
osmotic stress (2 0/00 and 120 0/00), seems to be a shutting
down of most body functions. In this state Tigriopus can
survive the extreme salinity levels for extended periods
of time (David Stoller 1977).
Patterson (1968) reported Tigriopus to be conformers
