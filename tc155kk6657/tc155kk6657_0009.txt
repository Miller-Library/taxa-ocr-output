changes related to osmoregulation may be at least pertially
masked.
SUMMARY
Tigriopus californicus exhibit a unique osmoregulatory
behavior which is highly adaptive in the high splash pool
habitat. They conform osmotically in intermediate salinities
and regulate hypo and hyper osmotically in high and low salinities
respectively.
Gut fluid appears to remain isosmotic with the environment.
Evidence is presented to suggest the gut may be a regulatory
surface in Tigriopus.
The range of osmoconformance depends on the length
of acclimation to a given salinity.
O consumption in Tigriopus is high in low salinities
decreasing as salinity rises. Metabolism appears not to change
significantly over the conforming range 35 to 60 0/00.
