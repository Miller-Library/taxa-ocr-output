istically different with respect to hyposmotic regulation
(T test: p£.02) and hyperosmotic regulation (T test:p (.003).
On all figures, the vertical dashed line is the approximate
EDgo for torpor.
B. Gut Volume vs. Salinity
As figure 2 shows, the gut volume changes significantly
with the onset of the torpor state. A 54% decrease in volume
is observed between 5 0/00 and low salinity torpor while
an increase of 92% is observed between 85 0/00 and high
salinity torpor at 120 0/00. In order to determine if the
gut volume at 5 0/00 was significantly larger than at the
other non-torpor salinities, a predicted value for 5 0/00
was obtained using the method of least squared linear reg¬
ression to extrapolate the non-torpor salinity data to
5 0/00. The standard error for this value was found using
the method of Sokal and Rohlf, Box 14.3. Using a student
T test, the actual and predicted values were found to be
different (p).025).
C. Metabolism Study
Figure 3 shows that Tigriopus' O, consumption decreases
with increasing salinities. There appears to be no significant
change in O, consumption between 35 and 60 0/00. Each
O consumption value is the mean of 3 data points for a given
salinity.
DISCUSSION
Euryhaline animals exhibit a wide variety of osmotic
behavior. Some conform, though they in general, buffer the
