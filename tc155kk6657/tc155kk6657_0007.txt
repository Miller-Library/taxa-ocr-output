based on osmotic concentration of gut fluid which was assumed
to be isosmotic with body fluid. This assumption is probably
incorrect since Tigriopus drink while active (Patterson 1968).
Further, the studies reported here and by Fisher and Bassett
(1976) indicate that the fluid from whole animal squashes
is regulated. In addition, gut volume changes occurring
during torpor can be best explained by assuming the gut to
be nearly isosmotic with the environment while
body fluids are regulated.
Upon entry into low salinity torpor, the gut volume
decreases drastically which is what would happen if the gut
were isosmotic with the environment and the animal stopped
regulating in torpor. For the same reasons, the gut is
expected to, and does, expand with the onset of high salinity
torpor. Hence the gut must be allowing water passage in
torpor which is not compensated by some active process.
An arguement may be made that the gut epithelium is
the site of regulation. The gut volume was larger than
normal in a 5 0/00 environment. This may imply that the
gut is pumping water out of the body to maintain hypertonicity
of the body fluids. Another line of evidence is the gut
volume changes observed when individuals enter torpor.
Thus when regulation ceases or is diminished in the gut
lining the osmotic flux begins. The gut also presents a
major surface area with permiability, access to internal and
external fluid environments, circulation of both by peristaltic
contractions and literature support for gut epithelia inÂ¬
volvement in regulation in other Crustacea (Artemia regulate
via the gut (Croghan 1958)). On the other hand the body
