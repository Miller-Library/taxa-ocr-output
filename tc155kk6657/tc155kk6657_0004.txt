under a compound microscope using pleces of broken coverslip
under the coverslip to prevent crushing of the animals.
Measurements of the width of the posterior and anterior
portions of the gut and of the length of the animal were
made. Animals with fecal pellets were not used because the
pellet caused a substancial increase in gut width. The
gut is nearly cylindrical and its length is entirely dependent
on the length of the animal, therefore width of anterior
portion plus width of posterior portion of the gut divided
by length of the animal is used to give an index of gut
volume corrected for animal size.
C. Metabolism study
Several hundred animals were acclimated for 24 hours
in 30 ml. baths of salinity 5, 10, 20, 35, 45, 55, 60,
and 85 0/00. A Gillson constant pressure respirometer was
used and three replicates for each salinity were tested.
Readings were taken every 15 minutes for an hour to make
sure the O2 consumption rate was constant. After the run,
the animals were dried in an oven (70 degrees F.) to constant
weight, then weighed.
RESULTS
A. Body Fluid Osmolarity
The data given in figure one shows a pattern of regulation
in low salinity, conformation in intermediate salinity and
regulation in high salinity. The data points are corrected
by 10 0/00 which represents the decrease in concentration
during the processing of controls. The two trials are stat-
