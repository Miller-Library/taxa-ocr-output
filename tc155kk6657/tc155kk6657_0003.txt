day the collections were made.
A sample of total body fluid was obtained using the
technique of Fisher and Bassett (1976) as follows. The
acclimated animals were pipetted onto a millipore suction
filter and washed with 2 - 4 mls. distilled water to remove
any residual salt from their bodies. The animals and filter
were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 1500 r.p.m. to dry the
animals. The filter was placed on dry ice and the frozen
animals scraped off into a watch glass where they were
ground with dry ice into a powder. This powder was scraped
into a capillary tube (1.1 - 1.2 mm internal diameter,
25 mm long and fused at one end) and centrifuged for at
least 3 hours at 1300 r.p.m. to separate body fluid from
body parts. A melting point determination was done using
the comparitive melting point method of Gross (1954).
Time points were taken as the last crystal to melt.
Controls to correct for errors such as condensation
from the air onto the groud sample were done. A potato
starch and water (salinities 40, 50, 60 0/00 were tested)
suspension was made in a watch glass and frozen with dry ice.
This was ground with dry ice scraped into a capillary tube
and centrifuged for 2 hours at 1300 r.p.m. The melting point
was found for the controls and the samples could be corrected
by the average error.
B. Gut Volume vs. salinity
About 50 animals were acclimated for four hours in
25 mls. of salinities 5, 20, 35, 55, 85, .5, and 120 0/00
(the latter two sets of animals were in torpor - the state
of apparent death). Several animals at a time were placed
