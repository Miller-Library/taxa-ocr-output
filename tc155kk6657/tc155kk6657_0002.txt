INTRODUCTION
Tigriopus californicus is a harpactecoid copepod inhabiting
high intertidal splash pools, which are subject to rapid
and large changes in salinity. Since they are found active
between 5 and 120 0/00, their osmoregulatory behavior is of
considerable interest. This is especially true because
the two studies on the subject appear to be contradictory.
Patterson (1968), based on analysis of gut fluid, claims
that Trigriopus is a conformer while Fisher and Bassett
(1976), using fluid from whole body squashes, found a unique
mode of osmotic regulation.
Both conformation and regulation have been demonstrated
for euryhaline crustacea. This may involve hyperosmotic
regulation, hyposmotic regulation and, in some cases, both
(Prosser 1973). The unique behavior of Trigriopus involves
conformation at intermediate salinities with hyposmotic
regulation at high salinities and hyperosmotic regulation
at low salinities.
MATERIALS and METHODS
A. Body Fluid Osmolarity
Tigriopus were collected for each trial from a high
tidepool (40 0/00 salinity) on Mussel Pt., Pacific Grove,
California during May 1977. 100 animals were acclimated
to each of the salinities: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 40, 45,
50, 55, 60, 68, 75, 85, and 120 0/00 for 38 - 44 hours
(trial 1) and 47 - 53 hours (trial 2). Females carrying
eggsacs were not used. Acclimation was begun on the same
