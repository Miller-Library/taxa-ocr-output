magnetic stirrer. The animal was protected from this flow
by placement on a screen resting on a small plastic table
(with a small opening for circulation throughout the tank).
The chamber was covered by another peice of lucite. An
O-ring made the system airtight when the two pieces of lucite
were bolted.. This system was covered by a black cloth, to
prevent interference by photosynthesizing organisms present
in seawater. Two sized chambers were used. Thirty-one hours
were required for a.30 gm worm to use theoxygen in a
214 ml chamber,, while a.26 gm worm required 18 hours to
consume the oxygen in a 58 ml tank.
The electrode was connected by a Beckman 496260 adaptor
to a Beckman Model 76 pH meter. Oxygen was measured as %
saturation. Before each run the electrode was calibra-
ted.. The 100% reading was obtained by bubbling air through
the water until the needle read a constant maximum value
(at which point the water was supersaturated) and then
removing the air source and allowing the needle to fall,
until a steady reading was reached, at which time the
oxygen in the water was in equilibrium with the air.. For
the 0% reading nitrogen was bubbled through the water until
the lowest constant value was reached. This normally took
between 30 and 60 minutes.
C.. Winkler.. Eight to ten animals were placed in a 60 ml
glass stoppered bottle.. This was closed and placed in
an appropriate temperature bath.. The worms were allowed to
respire for two hours, removed and the water analyzed by the
