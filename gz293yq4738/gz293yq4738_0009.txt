oxygen rich environment results in greatly Ancreased tentacle
movement,, and eventual reburrowing into the substrate.
Nothing definite can be said about the ability of C.
spirabrancha to regulate because of the possible contami-
nation by bacteria. Courtney found C. tentaculata had
a rate of one half normal at 40% saturation and no uptake
at 15%,, while Cirratulus cirratus (which is about the same
size as the C. spirabrancha which were used in this study)
had a rate of one half normal at 60% saturation and no
consumption below 40%. If bacterial contamination was
significant,, and only the decrease in respiration is consid-
ered, C. spirabrancha was about the same as Cirratulus
cirratus.
However, assuming no contamination, C. spirabrancha
with and without tentacles could regulate to 3%.. The runs
from 30% to 0% lasted only six to eight hours,, which would
not give bacteria sufficient time to multiply. These indicate
that this worm can regulate.
C.. spirabranche shows a size-weight relationship,
but not as dramatically as some other cirratulids (Court-
ney,1958) .. Glycine uptake, also related to surface to vol-
umn ratio showed only a slight correlation to size (Hubbard,
1968).. The tentacles might affect this relationship since
an increase in their number (and corresponding surface area)
could compensate for the decrease in surface to voulmn ratio
that a larger worm might experience.
The rhythm in the respiration rate was found to exist
in all the methods of measuring oxygen uptake. Some poly-
