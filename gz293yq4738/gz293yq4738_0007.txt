Winkler method (Giese,1964). At each temperature a control
bottle, with no organisms, was also tested.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the relationship of size to respir-
ation rate. Although this conforms to the general rule,
that larger organisms have a lower metabolic rate than
smaller ones (Zeuthen,1953),, it is not very pronounced
in C. spirabrancha. Animals without tentacles have a
respiration rate comparable to those with tentacles.
Fluctuations in rate were observed in each experi-
mental animal. This rhythm has not yet been defined.
Readings taken at 5,115, and 30 minute intervalsoshow
similiar patterns,, with peaks occuring about every other
reading. The magnitude of fluctuations using the Warburg
apparatus was tenfold; twofold fluctuations occured in
readings of the oxygen analyzer.. Figure 2 shows the pattern
in one worm, test√©diby the warburg method.
Under low oxygen tensions, every specimen of C. spira-
brancha would show a behavioral response. Tentacles be-
came fully extended, and the body would be stretched out.
This increase in surface area gave a greater area for
gaseous exchange.
Animals in closed chambers, with a continually decreasing
oxygen supply, show an initial decrease in respiration rate,
but thenan increase back to the initial rate. Figure 3
shows this pattern for one animal with tentacles and one
Uithout. Twoexperiments were run on animals with tenta-
