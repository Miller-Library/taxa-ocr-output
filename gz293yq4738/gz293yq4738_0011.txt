indication of the usefulness in using these methods to de-
termine the actual oxygen needs of these animals in their
environment. The Warburg was very artificial since 1)
the animal had very little water and 2) theg were sub-
jected to constant shaking. They were able ti "burrow"
in the screen in the oxygen analyzer, which may be impor-
tant, as these animals appear tp be quite thigmotactic..
The water in the chamber was moving.. Another difficulty
in using the closed chember is the CO effects. At low
oxygen tensions the worm has been in the chamber for many
hours, so the concentration of C0, might be quite high.
This factor is important in measuring the rates of a
planerian (Hyman,1930), but caused no difficulty in the work
on Nereis virens (Amberson,1924).. It does not appear to be
a factor in the present study, as long and short runs give
the same result at low oxygen tensions.
The Winkler method gave intermediete results. The
respoiration of a group of animals rather than individuals
was analyzed. The animals were disturbed by placing them in
the bottle, and this may have caused a slightly higher rate,
Although the Warburg may have resulted in excited animals,
studies can be made to determine size-weight relationships.
The oxygen analyzer is better for determining the actual
oxygen requirements of the animal and also studying its
ability to regulate.
