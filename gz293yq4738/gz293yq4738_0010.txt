chaetes show well defined activity rhythms. Arenicola
has a forty minute activity cycle (Wells,1949).. The large
amount of water thrust through the burrow once each cycle
provides fresh water for respiration.. Of three genera
studied by Mangum (1964) only one, Clymenella, showed an
activity pattern. The body wall of C. Spirabrancha shows
spontaneous activity (Rohlf,1968). These may be related
to some as yet undefined activity cycle in this polychaete.
The studies on acclimation seem to indicate that the
metabolism of these worms at low temperatures becomes depressed.
This is rather unusual as many animals which have become
acclimatized at a low temperature will gradually increase
metabolie rate so it aill be greater than animals immediate-
ly subjected to a lower temperature (Prosser,1962).
Stongelocentrotus purpuratus shows a relatively high rate
of feeding when first placed in 7°0 water, but after two
weeks, the rate is greatly decreased (Pearse, pers.comm.).
Cold acclimated worms showed a depressed rate even at higher
temperatures for two hours.. Apparently, this is not suffi-
cient time for recovery from the depressed rate maintained
at 7°0.
Worms acclimated to 2190 had a lower rate at this
temperature than worms from normal 15°0 seawater. This
is an expected result in temperature acclimation.
Methods
The three methods employed resulted in different
respiratory rates (compare graphs).. This may be an
