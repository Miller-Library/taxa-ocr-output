cles, two on animals without from 100% to 0g.. Three experi-
ments were run on animals without tentacles from 30% satur-
ation to 0%. The results were similiar to the last 30% of
the 100% to 0% runs. Bacterial contamination may have affected
these results.
C.. spirabrancha acclimated at 700 had a lower respira-
tion rate at each temperature studied than those kept at
higher temperatures.(Fig. 4) Those acclimated at 2100 had a
lower rate than the 15Â°0 worms just exposed to that temper-
ature.
DISCUSSION
Respiration
C. spirabrancha appears to be well adapted to its envi-
ronment.. Although it can get a normal supply of oxygen
through its body wall, as many other annelids (Dales,1963),
its main means of respiration is through its tentacles.
Courtney determined that the tentacles alone are sufficient
for full oxygen exchange.. Flatteley (1916) also noted
that the tentacles probably had a respiratory function.
The behavioral response to oxygen poor water is very
striking. Eventually almost all the tentacles become fully
drawn out in an apparent effort to increase absorptive
surface area. If these conditions continue the worm moves
to the surface of the sand and stretches its body, since
it, too, can act as an area of gaseous exchange.. However,
under completely anaerobic conditions, the worm curls its
tentacles and remains quiet (Findly,1968).. Return to an
