MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of C. spirabrancha were collected once a
week from + 1.0' M.L.T. level of the mudflat areas by
Fisherman's wharf at Monterey, California. They were kept
in finger bowls, filled with substrate from the same area.
These were placed in tanks which were supplied with fresh
flowing sea water and an air supply. Worms to be used in
experiments were washed, blotted dry and weighed. For some
experiments the tentacles were removed with scissors.
Acclimitized worms Were kept in finger bowls without
substrate, into which fresh seawater flowed..
Three methods of measuring oxygen consumption were
employed.
A. Warburg apparatus. One animal was placed in a 25 ml
flask with O.5 ml of 30% KOH supplied in a well to absorb
CO.. The volumn of the worm and seawater equaled 2.5 ml.
This was attached to a manometer and placed in a constant
temperature water bath. The system was continually shaken
except when readings were taken.
B.. Oxygen analyzer. A Beckman electrode was inserted in
a chamber, made of lucite plastic.. Constant temperature was
maintained by means of water from a constant temperature
bath circulating through a jacket surrounding the chamber.
The electrode was inserted through a small opening near
the bottom oftthe chamber, and sealed with lubriseal. A
flow past the electrode was maintained by a stirbar,, and a
