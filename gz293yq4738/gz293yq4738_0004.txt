INTRODUCTION
Some previous work has been done on polychaete respir-
ation.. Both Nicol (1964) and Prosser (1962) give tables
of respiration rates. Courtney (1958) determined rates
for Cirriformia (Audouinia) tentaculata and Cirratulus
cirratus, two cirratulids.. Less work has been done on
the ability of polychaetes to regulate under low oxygen ten-
sions. The oxygen consumption of Nereis virens is direct-
ly proportional to oxygen tension (Amberson,1924). Courtney
found the two cirratulid speciesshe studied also conformed.
The ability to regulate may be related to mode of life, but
in studies done thus far this does not seem to be the gener-
al rule (Hyman,1930).
Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore,1904) is a cirratulid
polychaete which inhabits fine sand and mud (Ricketts and
Calvin, 1962).. Under normal conditions,, it remains buried
with only its tentacles above the suface. The oxygen
content of such mud is very low. Jones (1955) determined
oxygen content of interstitial water from mud of a similiar
nature in a study on Nephthys. He found .11-.35 ml 0/liter
at 15°0, only 2%-6% oxygen satüration. During this project
the respiration rate of C. spirabrancha and its ability
to regulate under low oxygen tensions were determined.
