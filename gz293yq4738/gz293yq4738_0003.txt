ABSTRACT
1.. The respiration rate of Cirriformia spirabrancha
(Moore, 1904) is dependent on size and temperature.
2. C. spirabrancha acclimates at 21Â°0, but respination
rate becomes depressed at 700.
3.. In a sealed chamber, the respiration rate decreases and
thenincreases to initial value as the oxygen tension
decreases from 100% to 0%. This indicates the possibility
that C. spirabrancha can regulate its oxygen consumption.

4. The three techniques used to measure respiration rate
yeilded slightly different results, perhaps due to the
excited state of the worm during the experiments.
5.. An activity pattern was observed,but its cycle was
not determined.
