INTRODUCTION
The cirratulid polychaete, Cirriformia spirabrancha is
found in black mud of low oxygen content in intertidal and
subtidal areas along the central California coast. Other
polychaetes found in similar area, such as Arenicola (von
Brand, 1946), are capable of surviving anaerobiosis for per-
iods of several days. Little is known, however, about the
anaerobic potentialities of cirratulid worms. The present
investigation shows that Cirriformia can tolerate up to
forty-eight hours of anaerobiosis.
MATERIALS and METHODS
Anaerobic conditions were established in two ways. In
the first, worms were plaeed in soft glass Pasteur pipettes,
and the wide end of the pipette was heat sealed in a Meker
burner. The pipette was then filled, using a syringe, with
sea water deoxygenated by one hour of bubbling with nitrogen,
and the fine end was then heat sealed as above. Calculations
based on their known respiratory rate (Gladfelter, 1968) in-
dicate anaerobic conditions were established within one hour
under these conditions.
In a second method, sixteen ounce jars were half-filled
with either mud or fine glass beads, fifteen to twenty worms
placed on this substrate, and the jar filled with sea water.
An oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Company,
Model 51 0, Meter) was inserted through the lid, and the lid
sealed with lubriseal (Arthur H. Thomas Company, Philadelphia).
Anaerobic conditions were then established by allowing the
worms to utilize the available oxygen as determined by the
oxygen electrode reading.
