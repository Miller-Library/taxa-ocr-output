ABSTRACT
The cirratulid polychaete, Cirriformia spirabrancha,
was found to tolerate anaerobiosis up to forty-eight hours.
However, the biological advantage for the organism of anae-
robiosis is approximately twenty-four hours. Longer regimes
leave the animal moribund and subject to environmental ac-
tivities such as wave action which would disintegrate the
worm before recovery from anoxia. The length of the tentacles
and body increases as oxygen tension is lowered, but once
anaerobic conditions are reached the tentacles contract and
coil tightly, while the body remains elongate. Cyanide, for
reasons still unknown, is fatal within twenty hours. Whether
carbohydrates, which comprise 0.97% of the dry body weight,
are utilized during anaerobiosis is still unknown.
