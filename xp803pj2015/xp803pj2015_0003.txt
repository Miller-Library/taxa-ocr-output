Survival was assayed by removing the worms from the anaerobic
vessels and placing them on fine glass beads in finger bowls
in running sea water. If no movement was immediately evident
they were prodded with a glass stirring rod.
Carbohydrate determinations were made colorimetrically
by the phenol-sulfuric acid method of Dubois (1956) at 490 m
on a Beckman DU spectrophotometer with Gilford attachment.
Whole animals were homogenized in 2 ml of 70% ethanol, and
then brought to a final volume of 10 ml with 70% ethanol.
O.l ml of a saturated sodium sulfate solution was added to
facilitate precipitation (Van Handel, 1965), and the suspen-
sion centrifuged for twenty minutes on a clinical centrifuge.
Two ml of this supernatant was then analyzed for carbohydrate
as described above. The pellet was then resuspended in 3 ml
of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), boiled for one min-
ute, and centrifuged. Two ml of the supernatant, diluted
ten to one with 10% TCA, was then tested for total carbohy-
drate. Concentrations of sugar were determined from a stan-
dard curve of absorbance against micrograms of sugar.
RESULTS
Although worms could tolerate anaerobic conditions up
to sixty hours, forty-eight to fifty hours was the extreme
for most individuals. Recovery periods of two to three days
were required for animals after forty-eight hours of anaer-
obiosis. In many cases, however, after "living" for three
days, the animals would then die.
A survival period of up to forty-eight hours was found
for anaerobiosis, but worms could only survive a maximum of
twenty hours in 0.001 M cyanide. The reasons for this are
unclear, but may be related to nonspecific effects of cya-
nide on other enzymatic systems (Bellamy, 1968).
