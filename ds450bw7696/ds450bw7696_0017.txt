at dawn and dusk.
The daily temporal partitioning of the food resource is
amplified over portions of the tidal cycle by the fact that as
the high tide occurs at different times, the amount of wrack
available to amphipods at a given time of the night also
varies. Thus, the juveniles sometimes have an opportunity to
feed on wrack that is not available to the adults, for example:
any wrack that is washed away between the time that the juveÂ¬
niles emerge and when the adults become active. While adults
and juveniles do not show any clear separation in space, the
trapping data indicate that the juveniles are spread out more
widely on the beach than the adults. This would permit them
to make greater use of the smaller pieces of wrack spread
more widely on the beach, while the adult amphipods center
on the greatest concentrations of food.
