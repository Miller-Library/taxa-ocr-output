GENERAL DISCUSSION
The field population of O. corniculata studied exhibits
a pattern of movement and activity that shows adaptation to
the constantly changing conditions of their intertidal beach
habitat, maximizing both protection from hazards and stress
and opportunity to feed on fresh wrack. Fig. 9 is an ideal-
ized schematic diagram showing the general pattern of surface
movement and activity in adult and juvenile O. corniculata
as indicated by our field data. The pattern of behavior in¬
cludes a temporal separartion of peaks in adult and juvenile
activity. For achieving this separation, one mechanism
would be an avoidance response by juveniles to adults, the
juveniles burrowing or moving away as adults approached. No
indication of such avoidance is found. Instéad, our labora¬
tory studies of juvenile movement activity, together with
the studies of adult activity by Osbeck (1970) and McGinnis
(1972), strongly suggest that it is differences in juvenile
and adult activity rhythms that account for the differences
in juvenile and adult peaks of activity. Further, the fact
that the juvenile pattern is maintained after 48 hours of
constant light and moisture conditions suggests that the
rhythm is endogenous. Although this rhythm seems unaffected
over a two day period by absence of adult activity, the long
term effects of such absence are not known.
Interesting questi ons arise as to when and how the acti¬
vity pattern of the juveniles gives way to or become the
adult pattern. Although these studies did not directly ap-
