dark. The animals move about relatively little as they feed
through the night, then a second peak of activity is seen
prior to dawn. As the high tide occurs progressively later
in the evening, the peak of activity is correspondingly
shifted in time. With the high tide after dark but before
midnight, essentially no adult activity is observed before
the high tide (eg. May 4-5). When the high tide moves past
midnight, only a single peak is seen after the high tide, but
as this occurs, another phase of activity begins to appear
after sunset (eg. May 10-11). These adults emerging near
dusk will burrow into the beach before the tide reaches its
highest level. A second peak of activity occurs that night
after the high tide has passed.
The peaks of activity shown in Fig. 3 exhibit a range of
magnitudes. A broad peak is usually correlated with a fall-
ing tide. Some apparent variability in both the height and
the timing of the peaks is probably not real, but results
from the fact that activity was only sampled hourly. Hourly
sampling adequately reveals the general pattern of activity
but a precise picture would require essentially continuous
sampling. The two periods which show least clearly the exÂ¬
pected pattern of activity (Fig. 3, May 4-5, May 15-16),
were those with the most extreme conditions of high wind and
surf. Amphipod movement activity is much reduced in harsh
weather conditions. In Fig. 3, the greater the number of days
elapsed between sequential observations, in general the great-
er was the degree of change in the pattern of activity. As
expected, data taken on two successive nights (May 24-25, May
