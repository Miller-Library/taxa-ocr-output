corniculata Population Movement

Baker and Yip
Bowers (1964) described the distribution of the O.
corniculata population on a beach only about 300 m. over¬
land from our study site. He noted that distribution was
related to the semi-lunar spring-neap tidal cycle. Bowers
observed that the population was higher on the beach during
the spring tides and moved down the beach along with the
shift to neap tides and as the wrack each day was deposited
lower down. The beach he studied (Monterey Boatworks beach
faces northeast rather than west at Mussel Point, has a much
gentler slope, and is much more protected from high surf.
In the present study, as data were gathered over a period of
roughly two semi-lunar cycles, such a pattern was looked for
in the spatial distribution of the population on the beach.
However, it became apparent that on our steeper west-facing,
and much more exposed beach, weather conditions have a much
greater effect on the height of water and the presence of
wrack on the beach than does the spring-neap tidal regime.
In addition, the analysis in Fig. 6 shows that the popula-
tion distribution of active animals is modified by the timing
of the high tide. The situation with regard to the semi-lunar
pattern of distribution appears to be somewhat more complex
than that described by Bowers, even given constant weather
conditions.
Having considered the general advantages to the amphipod
population of the movement and activity pattern seen in the
field, we now address the question of what selective advantages,
if any, are accrued by a temporal separation of adult and ju¬
venile activity. Available information suggests several pos-
