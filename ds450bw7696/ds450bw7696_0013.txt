Having established the temporal separation of adult and
juvenile activity peaks, and confirmed one possible selective
advantage thereof, the next area we explored was the mechanism
of separation. One possible mechanism for achieving activity
separation of the size classes might be an active avoidance
of adult amphipods by juveniles.
In studying direct behavioral interactions of adults and
juveniles, two different techniques were used: direct ob¬
servation, and photography. For direct observations, the
animals were kept in 500 ml flasks and watched under normal
laboratory lighting. For the photographic studies, the amphi¬
pods were placed in a petri dish with a diameter of 15 cm
lined with damp filter paper to provide a substrate suitable
for movement of the animals. The dish was divided in half by
a cardboard partition to allow simultaneous photography of two
physically isolated populations. The animals were kept in to-
tal darkness except when photographed with an electronic flash.
Direct observations show that juveniles are indifferent
to the presence of active adults, even when physical contact
occurs. Photographic studies support this conclusion. Distri¬
bution of juvenile amphipods in one half of a petri dish does
not significantly change after an adult is introduced into
the container and neither is there a significant difference
in the distribution of juvenile amphipods between two physi¬
cally separated halves of a dish when one half contains an a¬
dult and the other does not.
To investigate the possibility that differences in en¬
dogenous rhythms between adults and juveniles result in dif-
