compared with the number originally placed in the containers.
Both the procedures and the results are pictured in Fig. 7
for these experiments. In general, it can be seen that while
100% of the juveniles were recovered from all the control
flasks, juveniles were often missing from those flasks which
did contain adults, and those could only have been eaten.
Field and laboratory observations show that cannibalism
is one possible selction pressure for temporal separation of
adult and juvenile movement activity at the beach surface.
It would appear advantageous for the juveniles to be active
when adults are burrowed and to burrow and seek concealment
during periods of adult activity. Assuming that burrowing
does provide protection, we expected reduced cannibalism in
laboratory experiments as the depth of the sand layer in the
flasks increased. Instead, the least juvenile mortality was
seen in flasks floored with a monolayer of sand grains;
greater mortality was found in the flasks with more sand,
though those with 1/2 inch of sand and those with 1 inch of
sand showed no significant difference. Direct observations
of the animals in flasks indicate that a monolayer of sand
over glass does not provide a substrate allowing effective
locomotion and normal behavior, resulting in reduced juvenile
mortality. In the flasks with more sand, no observations were
made which might explain the lack of advantages of the greater
amount of sand. The experiments indicate that adults of both
sexes feed on juveniles under laboratory conditions. The
presence of a surplus of an alternate source of food such as
the kelp Macrocystis does not necessarily prevent cannibalism.
