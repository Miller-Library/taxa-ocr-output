SUMMAR
1.
A population of Orchestoidea corniculata on a steep sandy
beach at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California was studied to
determine movement activity at the sand surface. Sampling was
done with directional and nondirectional pitfall traps on a
transect taken from the land vegetation to the sea.
The adult field population shows peaks of activity that
2.
exhibit both the circadian and circatidal rhythms reported by
earlier investigators. Adults are burrowed in the sand by day
and activity on the beach surface is confined to the hours of
darkness. When high tide occurs before midnight, the adults do
not emerge until the tide begins to ebb. They show a peak of
movement activity soon after emergence, followed by a period of
feeding during which little movement occurs, and then a second
peak of movement activity before sunrise. If high tide falls
after midnight, the adults emerge sometime after sunset, burrow
before the high, and then reemerge, showing another peak of
activity on the descending tide.
The peaks of movement activity of adults and juveniles
3.
do not occur simultaneously but show a temporal separarion.
The juveniles usually show a peak of activity around sunset,
before the adults emerge, and another peak around sunrise, after
the adults have burrowed for the day. Juveniles sometimes show anÂ¬
other peak in movement at the same time as the adults on a
descending tide during the night.

There is no correspondingly distinct spatial separation
between adult and juvenile activity on the surface of the beach.
