O. corniculata Population Movement
Baker and Yip
25-26), with similar weather conditions, show highly similar
activity patterns. Consistently, there is a separation of
adult and juvenile peaks of activity, even though this is
sometimes less clear on a descending tide.
The question arises as to whether the temporal separation
of adult and juvenile activity is accompanied by a spatial
separation, especially when significant numbers of both size
classes are active on the beach. Fig. 4 examines the distri¬
bution on the beach of adult and juvenile amphipods at speci¬
fic times. Although there is a tendency for juveniles to be
more widely distributed, there is no distinct spatial separa¬
tion of adults and juveniles.
The major directional movements of the O. corniculata
population on the beach surface are shown in Fig. 5. For
each station on the beach the numbers of amphipods caught in
a pair of oppositely oriented directional traps are compared;
the smaller number is subtracted from the larger. The dif-
ference is represented as a vector for net directional move¬
ment at that-station. If the difference between the two traps
was greater than 5 animals, a vector arrow is plotted on Fig.
5. This graph shows net directional movement in relation to
time, tide, and vertical position on the beach. At the times
of major activity (as shown in Fig. 3) the movement appears
to be directional. The net movement of amphipods is usually
in the direction that the tide is flowing. In the few ex¬
ceptions where movement is in the direction opposite to that
of the tide (eg. at 0130 hrs, May 8), the animals appear to
be going toward thelevel of a major concentration of wrack on
