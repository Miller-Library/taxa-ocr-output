counted, the amphipods were released back on the beach at
a distance judged sufficient to prevent any effects on the
results of subsequent samples.
Two tests were made to check the reliability of our
sampling techniques. In one preliminary study, traps were
established along 3 parallel transects 5 m. apart. Sampled
at hourly intervals, all profiles showed the same trends in
population fluctuations, and while absolute numbers caught
showed some variation there was no evidence of clumping.
In
a second test, the catches of duplicate directional traps
set 20 cm apart were analyzed statistically using the Rx C
test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969). The duplicate traps showed no
significant differences in numbers caught during identical
periods (p.5), allowing the conclusion that variation
between duplicate traps was random and not due to clumping
of animals.
Data were plotted each time the population was sampled,
and the raw data immediately graphed to yield a stylized time-
lapse picture of the transect. See Fig. 2. For each hourly
observation the number of amphipods in each trap was plotted
at a point on the vertical axis representing height on the
beach. Information for large and small amphipods was treated
separately. Animals less than 6 mm in length in normal pos-
ture with the rear segments curled under the body were classed
as juveniles. All animals of greater length were classed as
adults though some probably were not sexually mature. Ori¬
