experiments investigating cannibalism of juveniles
by adults. Each bar represents the results obtained
from one flask. Total length of bar shows number of
juveniles added to flask in the evening, black
portion shows number consumed by adults. Ad. -
adults, Juv. - juveniles.

Results of experiments comparing activity patterns
of juveniles maintained in 3 gallon cartons under
constant dim light, in the presence and in the
absence of adults. The experimental setup is
pictured at the top of the graph. The graph shows
the numbers of juveniles caught in a pitfall trap
in a 5 minute sampling period at hourly intervals,
and reflect the amount of movement activity in
the carton. All experiments were run in duplicate:
mean values are shown by the thick bars, ranges by the
the thin vertical lines thereon.

An idealized model, based on field data, showir
changing patterns of activity, and directional
movement in O. corniculata. Zigzag horizontal lines
portray tidal rise and fall. Five days are shown,
representative of a full tidal cycle. Squares reÂ¬
present feeding without much accompanying movement
activity. The diagonal dashed line is merely a
visual aid connecting the high tides occuring
2-3 days apart. Triangles on baselines indicate
major periods of activity for adults (dotted lines)
