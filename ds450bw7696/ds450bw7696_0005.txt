Results
Fig. 3 summarizes data showing the amount of movement
activity in relation to the time of day. The total amount of
activity for each hour is a number obtained by summing the
numbers of amphipods caught in traps at all levels of the
beach at that hour. Summing was done separately for adults
and juveniles. This number is an indication only of move¬
ment activity, and takes no account, for example, of amphi¬
pods which are stationary and feeding on the wrack. Adults
and juveniles show somewhat separated periods of activity.
Peaks of activity show a relationship to the times of dusk
and dawn, and to the period following a night time high tide,
accentuated in Fig. 3 by the line connecting the peaks of
the high tide.
In juvenile O. corniculata there are two peaks of ac¬
tivity, one around sunset and one around sunrise. The peak
of activity at dawn was also noted by Craig (1973) in a
short study. Another smaller and less regular increase of
activity occurs in the middle of the night and is as¬
sociated with a descending tide.
Movement activity of adult O. corniculata is more sharp¬
ly limited to the period of darkness, and generally shows a
bimodal pattern. When the high tide occurs before dark (eg.
May 1-2), the first peak of activity occurs shortly after
