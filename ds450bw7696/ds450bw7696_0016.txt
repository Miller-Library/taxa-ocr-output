proach this problem, qualitative observations suggest a gradual
transformation. Smaller, probably sexually immature sub-adult
amphipods were generally caught in the traps at least one hour
before the larger adults appeared. This suggests a gradual
shifting from juvenile to adult activity patterns.
With regard to the possible selective advantages for the
temporal separation of juvenile and adult activity peaks, can -
nibalism of young by adults has been demonstrated. This
phenomenon can be significant in the laboratory.
It occurs
in the field, but its significance there and its dependence
on environmental parameters are unknown.
A second possible advantage to temporal separation of a¬
dult and juvenile activity peaks is the reduction of intra¬
specific competition. Juvenile amphipods are basically mini¬
atures of the adults. Both feed on fresh wrack, especially
Macrocystis, the giant kelp. Temporal separation of activity
peaks is a way of increasing the food resources and making
more efficient use of the supply. Since wrack bands are con¬
stantly being deposited or washed away, increasing the amount
of time that the population as a whole is out and active in¬
creases the amount of wrack available to the population.
Speculating further, it seems likely that the juveniles can
relatively safely emerge before darkness and remain on the
surface for sometime after dawn, allowing them periods of
feeding before and after adult activity. We found the juveniles
to be much smaller and faster moving than the adults, thus they
may be poorer targets for shorebirds, the major amphipod pre¬
dator (Bowers, 1964), which have peaks of feeding activity
