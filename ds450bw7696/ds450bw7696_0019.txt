O corniculata population Movement

Baker and Yip
Generally, O. corniculata move up and down the slope of
the beach in the direction that the tide is going. This be¬
havior is advantageous in maximizing both protection from surf
and desiccation, and opportunity to feed. Seaward movement is as¬
sociated with feeding on the bands of wrack deposited by the
receding tåde. Landward movement is often associated with bur-
rowing, which provides further protection from wave action.

Distribution of active adult and juvenile amphipodseon
the beach over the entire night is a function of the tidal
cycle and the location and amount of wrack present. The timing
of the night high and low tides is crucial, as most directional
movement occurs during the amphipod activity peaks. A low tide
in the middle of the night favors adult dispersal; low tides at
dusk and dawn allow juvenile dispersal. Adults tend to gather
near major wrack concentrations, while juveniles are more widely
distributed. However, when very little wrack is available the
adults also tend to disperse widely.
Cannibalism of juveniles by adults, demonstrated in field
and laboratory, provides one selctive pressure for temporal
separation in adults and juveniles of peak activity. Laboratory
studies show no significant correlation bétween extent of can¬
nibalism and 1) the amount of sand available for juveniles bur¬
rowing, and 2) the presence of alternate food such as Macrocystis.
Temporal separation of adult and juvenile activity peaks also
reduces intraspecific competition for food, and extends the time
available for wrack feeding.
No avoidance of adults by juveniles was demonstrated, even
