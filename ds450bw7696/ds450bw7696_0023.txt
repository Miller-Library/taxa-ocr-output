Diagram of the beach transect sampled, seen from
above. Circles represent pitfall traps and the
larger semicircles represent wire screens placed
either above or below the traps to insure direc¬
tional catches. The elevation of the beach sur-
face at each station is given as height above
mean lower low water.

night of observations. Bars without arrows show
numbers of animals caught in nondirectional traps
and bars with arrows those caught in directional traps.
The lengthx width of the bar is proportional to
the number of animals caught. The level at which
the amphipods were trapped is marked by the center of
the bars without arrows, or the bagse of the bars with
arrows. The tip of each arrow indicates the direction
of travel implied by the type of trap in which the
amphipods were caught. Location and relative size
of the wrack bands are indicated. Sunset was at 2000
hrs and sunrise was at 0600 hrs, Pp81.
