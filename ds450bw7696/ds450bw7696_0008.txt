the beach.
Vertical movements of amphipods along the slope of a
beach during changes in tidal height result in changes in
population distribution. In Fig. 6, distribution of the
population for a given night is described by histograms
showing the total numbers of amphipods trapped at each sta-
tion during that whole night. When a high tide occurs near
midnight, both the adult and juvenile amphipods are usually
trapped in greatest numbers at the relatively restricted level
where wrack is concentrated under these conditions. In con¬
trast, when the tide is descending through the middle of the
night, the adults are more dispersed; wrack is generally
abundant at several levels under such conditions. The ju¬
venile population may show a concentration higher up on the
beach, since the water level is higher during their peaks of
activity. During periods of strong surf, very little wrack
may be deposited on the beach, and the adults are again more
dispersed. These results substantiate the conclusion that
wrack is an important factor influencing the spatial distri-
bution of O. corniculata and that there is population move-
ment toward the wrack on the beach.
Discussion
The pattern of activity and directional movement of O.
corniculata discerned from the field studies appears to be
well-suited to a species living in the somewhat precarious
environment of the steep beach intertidal zone. Nocturnal
