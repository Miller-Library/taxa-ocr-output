beach, the change in elevation between stations ranged from
1.7 to 1.9 ft. To sample the amphipod population, Pyrex
dishes 4.5 cm in depth and 9 cm in diameter were buried in
the beach at each station, with the lip of the dish level
with the sand surface. Amphipods were thus caught whether
walking or hopping. When the dishes were dry, the amphipods
were able to hop or crawl out of them easily; with an inch
of water in the bottom, the dishes retained both adults and
juveniles very effectively. Some dishes were made into
directional traps by placing a semicircular piece of wire
window screen, 10 inches high and 6 inches across the opening,
either above the dish and facing toward the ocean or below
the dish and facing away from the ocean

servations in the field showed that the amphipods neither
climbed nor jumped over the screens. Two directional traps
and one nondirectional trap were maintained at each station
on the beach. At certain times spatially intermediate
stations were established between permanent stations as
dictated by the height of the water.
Our own preliminary studies and earlier literature in¬
dicated that O. corniculata is mostly active during the hours
of darkness, therefore each sampling run was started at 1900
hrs Pacific Daylight Savings Time, and samples were taken at
hourly intervals through 0700 hrs the next morning. At each
sampling time, the traps were filled with water and allowed
to stand for 10 minutes. Then the water and any amphipods
in the traps were poured into marked fingerbowls to be counted.
The traps were immediately reburied on the beach. Once
