sibilities. One selective advantage might be reduction of
intraspecific competition, especially for food. Since no
actual experimentation was done in this area, speculation
on it is reserved for later discussion.
A second selection pressure that might encourage sepa¬
ration of adult and juvenile activity peaks was suggested by
an observation made in the field. A small individual nudged
into a burrow occupied by a larger amphipod was immediately
rabbed and eaten by the latter. Clearly, cannibalism by
adults on juveniles might provide a selective pressure to¬
ward separating peaks of activity of the two principal size
classes.
LABORATORY STUDIES
To investigate the possibility of predation by large
O. corniculata on smaller individuals, laboratory tests were
carried out using 500 ml flasks plugged by foam stoppers
Control flasks contained only juveniles, experimental flasks
contained both juveniles and adults. Factors varied in the
experiment included the amount of sand, the number of large
individuals, and the amount of fresh kelp put in the flasks
as food for both juveniles and adults. Unless otherwise
noted, all adults were captured24 hours before the experiment
began, and thus were without food for one night. Juveniles
were caught and placed in the flasks the day of the experiment.
The flasks were then placed in a dark cabinet and left over-
night. The number of juveniles recovered from each flask was
