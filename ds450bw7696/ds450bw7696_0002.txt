iculata. The question of orientation in movement has also
been investigated by several researchers (Craig, 1971, 1973;
Enright, 1961; Hartwick, 1976).
Previous studies of O. corniculata have not provided a
detailed picture of population activity and movements in the
field. It was the objective of the present study to gather
the information necessary to provide such a picture. An ef¬
fort was made to sample the population over a series of dif¬
ferent tidal conditions sufficiently varied to make possible
the development of a simple predictive model for the move¬
ment of the population in space and time. Particular emphasis
was placed on obtaining data regarding directional movement
and on differences between adult and juvenile activity, since
little quantitative information is currently available on
these aspects of Orchestoidea biology.
FIELD STUDIES
Methods
Field studies were carried out between 24 April and 1
June, 1978, on a population of Orchestoidea corniculata on
the west beach of the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University, located on Mussel Point in Pacific Grove, Cal¬
ifornia. A straight line transect was staked out from just
below the land vegetation down to about +2 ft. above mean
lower low water. Sampling stations were set up along this
transect at 4 m. intervals. Although the stations were
equal distances apart measuredalong the surface of the
