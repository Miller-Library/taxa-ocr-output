ferently timed peaks of activity, a laboratory setup was de-
signed to determine if juveniles deprived of environmental
cues exhibit peaks similar to those seen in the field, and if
these peaks might be affected by the presence of adults in a
more subtle way than could be revealed by our other studies.
Three-gallon circular cartons were obtained and a circu¬
lar hole cut in the bottom of each to allow insertion of a 6
cm in diameter
cm long plastic tûbevopen at both ends. When the carton was
filled to a depth of 4 cm with sand, the sand just reached
the level of the top of the tube on the inside and the tube
acted as a pitfall trap: any animal falling into the tube
would drop through to a dish of water placed below the bot¬
tom of the tube. The tube could be plugged at most times,
enabling amphipods to jump out again if they fell in, and un-
plugged only at sampling times. The animals for this experis
ment were collected the day the experiment began. Some of the
cartons contained only small individuals, others both large
and small. All experiments were run between 1930 and 0830 hrs.
The cartons were kept in constant dim light and were sampled
for five minutes at hourly intervals.
Fig. 8 shows the setup, the details of each experiment
and the results. All four cartons show juvenile activity pat¬
terns similar to those observed simultaneously in the field.
Peaks in the number of juveniles trapped were around the hours
of sunsét and sunrise. No significant differences were obser¬
ved between the cartons that contained juveniles and those that
did not. An earlier experiment in which the juveniles (200 per
carton) were kept in constant dim light for a period of 18
hours before sampling began yielded similar results.
