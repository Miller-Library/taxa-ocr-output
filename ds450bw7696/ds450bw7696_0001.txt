INTRODUCTION
The semi-terrestrial amphipod Orchestoidea corniculata
Stout, 1913, inhabits the higher intertidal zone on sandy
beaches. Of the several species of Orchestoidea common in
California, O. corniculata is the one most abundant on
short, steep beaches with sand grains poorly sorted for size
(Bowers, 1964). The amphipods are basically nocturnal,
emerging from burrows at dusk and reburrowing at dawn. During
the hours of darkness, they move about the beach by hopping
or crawling, and feed on fresh wrack.
Identification of 0. corniculata in both juvenile and
adult instars has been facilitated by the keys in Bousfield
(1957, 1959, 1975), the studies by McClurkin (1953), and es-
pecially by the field identification key presented by Bowers
(1963). Bowers (1964) also investigated the natural history
and some aspects of the behavior of 0. corniculata in his ex¬
amination of niche separation between this species and O.
californiana. Further field studies on the distributions of
both burrowed and active O. corniculata were made by Craig
(1973). He sampled a population using pitfall traps and sub-
surface cores, but he did not extend his studies over the full
range of tidal conditions. Osbeck (1970) in laboratory studies
demonstrated two separate endogenous rhythms of activity, one
rhythm having a circadian periodicity, the other possibly
reflecting the tidal cycle. McGinnis (1972) found clear evi¬
dence of an endogenous circatidal rhythm in adult 0. corn¬
