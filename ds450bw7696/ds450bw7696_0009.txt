activity provides maximal protection from visual predators
such as shore-birds (Bowers, 1964). Further, the amphipods
seem unable to tolerate much desiccation, and by burrowing
in the daytime when the surface sand is driest, they find
suitable moisture in addition to protection (Bowers, 1964).
A circatidal rhythm within the constraints of the circadian
rhythm provides even more precise behavioral adaptations.
For moisture and food, the amphipod must be active in the
area of the beach that is wetted by the high tides. However,
there is the danger of being swept away by the water. A
tidal rhythm of behavior which includes burrowing at high tides
greatly reduces this risk. The peak of movement activity
shortly after the high tide is advantageous to the animal
because it corresponds to the best feeding conditions. It
is important that net seaward movement is associated with
this peak in activity. By moving down the beach with the
descending tide, the amphipods find maximal opportunity for
feeding as they encounter the successive bands of fresh wrack
which are left by the receding water. Correspondingly, by
moving landward with a rising tide, the animals increase
their safety from wave action. Some animals actively move
up the beach, others are carried landward by the swash, rafted
aboard the wrack on which they are feeding (Bowers, 1964).
Landward movement is generally associated with burrowing. It
may also be advantageous for the animals to move landward
because if they burrow too low on the beach, they may be co¬
vered by water for a greater part of the tidal cycle, decreas¬
ing the time during which they can emerge and feed.
