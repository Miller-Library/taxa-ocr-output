Spatial distribution of adult and juvenile O.
corniculata at selected times (right column),
and total number of animals trapped versus time
for the same period (left column). Histograms in

the right column show levels on the beach,amphipods
were trapped, and numbers caught. Adult/juvenile
composition of the actively moving population
at the particular times analyzed can be obtained
from the left column (see arrows).

horizontal black lines in center columns show
total numbers of juvenile and adult amphipods
caught during the whole night at each level of the
beach sampled. Two columns at margins show tidal
regime, swash, and location of wrack on the beach
for each night studied, adjacent to the distribution
curves.
