the whole fish, not in the fat, has been temporarily imposed. The
rationalization behind this dualism is not clear, but my data show
that if the limit in fish is set at the same level as in beef, most
of the fish of this study would exceed it.
Reproductive failure in fish exposed to DDT has been shown
in studies of the effect of DDT on reproduction in some fresh water
fish (Macek, 1968; Burdick, 1964; Cuerrier, 1967). Although this data
cannot be directly compared to my results, the data given in this paper
indicates that the levels of DDE in marine fishes are sufficiently
high to warrent further investigations on the possibility of repro-
ductive failure occurring now in marine fishes. Furthermore, the
high levels of DDE suggest that the effects of DDE as well as DDT on
reproduction should be studied.
The data from the analysis of bocaccio livers shows a great
variability in concentration of DDE. However, the correlation co-
efficients were high enough to indicate a definite trend toward
higher concentrations in both larger and older fish. By considering
fish caught on 26 May, and by considering fish only between 600 and
1700 grams in weight (to eliminate somewhat the differences between
the two groups due to size and age differences), I found that the DDE
levels were significantly different (pÂ«0.002). Since the fish in
both groups were caught in approximately the same area, it can only
be concluded that the levels of DDE in bocaccio are highly variable.
The small number of fish analyzed limits the conclusions that can be
drawn.
