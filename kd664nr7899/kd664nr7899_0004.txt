The investigations reported in this paper represent the
results of both a survey of natural DDE levels in six commercially
important organisms and a more detailed study of the relation be-
tween pesticide levels and age and weight in one of these fishes.
the bocaccio. Results indicated that the concentrations of DDE were
generally larger in animals feeding on higher trophic levels, and that
within a given species (Sebastodes paucispinis) the amount of pesticide
could be positively correlated to both age and weight.
METHODS
Specimens were either collected by the author or bought on
the commercial wharf in Monterey, and were analyzed the same day.
The following six species were analyzed for general DDE level: squid
(Loligo opalescans), cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus), speckled
sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus), blue rockfish (Sebastodes mystinus),
Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and bococcio (S. paucispinis).
Squid, cabezon, blue rockfish, and bocaccio were analyzed by the
author, while the results shown for anchovy and sanddab were obtained
from the studies of Kaplan (1969) and Phillips (1969). These species
were selected for their commercial importance, position as to trophic
level, and availability. The specimens were divided into edible (flesh
and bone) and non-edible (head and viscera) portions, which were an-
alyzed separately so that the levels in both the portion normally
utilized for human consumption (which necessarily contained some bone)
and the levels in the entire organism could be determined separately.
