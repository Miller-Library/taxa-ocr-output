In the investigation relating DDE levels to age and weight
in bocaccio, analysis was restricted to the liver. This was feasible
because the high lipid content of the liver makes it a repository for
DDE, and this tissue apparently has DDE levels which parallel those
levels found in the whole fish. Bocaccio was chosen because of the
high concentration of DDE found earlier in the study, its availability,
and the fact that this fish initially consumes only plankton but
gradually feeds on higher trophic levels as it matures. The fish
were aged by examination of their otoliths.
Tissues for analysis were digested in equal parts glacial
acetic and perchloric acids, the lipid portion extracted with nano-
grade hexane (Mallinckrodt), and the lipid removed before analysis
in a modified Davidow column (cf. Stanley and LeFavoure, 1965). The
chromatograms were performed isothermally (200° C) on a Beckman GC 4
gas chromatograph equipped with electron capture detector. The
carrier gas was helium. The column (3 per cent OF 1 on 80 - 100 mesh
'Chromosorb W') could not be used to obtain quantitative values for
other than DDE. Since DDE represents approximately 80 per cent of
the total DDT and its derivatives (Risebrough, 1969), it was used as
an index of pesticide level. All chemicals and other materials were
checked for purity before use to assure the absence of DDE, Glass¬
ware was repeatedly rinsed in nanograde hexane, which was then con-
centrated and checked for absence of DDE on the chromatograph.
