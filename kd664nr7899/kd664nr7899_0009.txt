In short, these studies show that the levels of pesticide
in the tissues of those organisms analyzed are sufficiently high to
suggest rather extensive pollution of the marine environment. Second.
there appears to be a rather general relationship between total DDE
concentration and trophic level, suggesting greater accumulation in
organisms feeding on higher trophic levels. While no direct inves-
tigations were made of whole fish, the combined results from viscera
and edible portions of the bocaccio suggest that some of these fish
may well be concentrating pesticides in excess of the levels now conÂ¬
sidered allowable for human consumption. Finally, it is suggested
that some marine organisms may well be accumulating sufficient pest-
icide residues to interfere with normal reproduction.
