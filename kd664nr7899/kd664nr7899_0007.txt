Note the higher values in the fish caught on 26 May, especially where
the two groups overlap in age.
Figure Two shows ppm DDE plotted against the total weight
of the fish. The correlation coefficient is 0.711. Again note the
difference between the two groups of fish.
DISCUSSION
The data from the analysis of six species of marine organisms
show that DDE is present at concentrations far above that found in
sea water.
The data also indicate that DDE is probably concentrated
in marine food webs. The lowest values were found in squid, which
feed on low trophic levels and are mostly pelagic. Higher levels
were found in the cabezon, speckled sanddab, and blue rockfish, all
of which are second-level carnivores. The highest values were found
in the bocaccio, which is a high-level carnivore. The anchovy, which
filter-feeds on several trophic levels, probably has high concentrations
of DDE for two reasons. First, anchovy are not permanent residents
of the area, unlike the other organisms studied, and may have en-
countered high levels in the environment elsewhere. Second, anchovy
contain a higher per cent of lipid than the other species studied.
The concentration of DDE in lipid ranges from 6.18 to 58.5
ppm. The maximum legal level of DDT and its derivatives in beef fat
has been set by the Food and Drug Administration at 7 ppm. The level
in fish has not been permanently set. However, a limit of 5 ppm in
