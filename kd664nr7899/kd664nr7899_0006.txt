RESULTS
Table One illustrates the levels of DDE found in the mus-
culature of the various organisms studied. For these determinations,
ten squid, twenty-five sanddabs, twenty-fiye anchovy, and one each
of the other fishes were analyzed. The values in lipid are considered
low due to technical difficulties. Note: (1) the levels of DDE in
the organisms relative to the level in sea water, (2) the higher levels
of DDE in organisms feeding on higher trophic levels, (3) the level
of DDE in the anchovy, which seems higher than would be expected con-
sidering the trophic level on which it feeds, and (4) the extremely
high values in lipid.
Table Two illustrates the levels of DDE for the whole or-
ganism in some of the same animals. Note the high concentrations reÂ¬
corded for bocaccio.
Figure One shows the parts per million of DDE determined
for the livers of eleven bocaccio plotted against the age of the fish.
The line was computed statistically; the correlation coefficient is
0.678. The circled points denote fish caught by a commercial vessel
on 21 May, landed and analyzed on 22 May. The uncircled points in-
dicate fish that were caught by a commercial vessel on 26 May, landed
and analyzed on 27 May. On both days the vessel was operating just
north of Point Sur, California. The one very young fish was caught
for the author by personnel of the California Department of Fish and
Game working on the reef opposite Cabrillo Point on Monterey Bay.
