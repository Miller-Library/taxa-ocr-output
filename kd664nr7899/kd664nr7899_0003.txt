INTRODUCTION
The work of several investigators has shown that DDT and
its derivatives DDE and DDD are widespread in the marine environment
(Risebrough, et al, 1967; Wurster, 1968). Only a few studies have
been completed concerning DDT levels in marine fishes (Risebrough,
1968; Parrish, 1969). Just one such study has been published (Odemar,
1968). As to commercial fishes from Monterey Bay (Monterey County,
California), analyses have been performed on only the anchovy (Rise-
brough, 1968; Kaplan, 1969), speckled sanddab (Phillips, 1969), English
sole (Risebrough, 1968), and starry flounder (Odemar, 1968).
There are four basic reasons why information on DDT levels
in marine fishes may be of importance. First, due to the biological
concentration of these pesticides, the levels now present in marine
fishes can give us a qualitative idea of the extent of pesticide pol-
lution in the marine environment. Second, the relative levels in
fishes feeding on different trophic levels can indicate whether or
not pesticides are concentrated in marine food webs as they are in
terrestrial food webs (Rudd, 1964). Third, it would be interesting
to know whether or not the levels of DDT might be high enough to sur-
pass the minimum level allowed in human food by the Food and Drug
Administration. Finally, the presence of DDT has been linked with
reproductive failure in birds and fresh water fishes (Macek, 1968:
Burdick, 1964; Currier, 1967), and levels might be high enough in
marine fishes to also pose a threat to them.
