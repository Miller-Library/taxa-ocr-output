Eunagurus (Cheesman & Prebble, 1966) and in a sub-
sequent publication in the same year canthaxanthin
was found in the green carotenoprotein of the marine
isopod Idotea montereyonsis (Maloney) (Lee, 1966a).
Canthaxanthin was also shown to be involved in the
ea resecata (Stimpson) (lee a
carotenoprotein of Ido
Gilchrist, 1972) and in a variety of Anostraca (Gil¬
christ, 1968). Other than very preliminary work
little is known about these canthaxanthin-caroteno¬
proteins.
Recently, studies conducted on the egg astaxanthin-
carotenoproteins of a variety of aquatic invertebrates
indicated these proteins to exhibit remarkable simi-
larities (Zagalsky, 1971). This relatedness combined
with wide distribution may imply that these proteins
have similar functions, perhaps developmental in
nature. The function of the canthaxanthin-caroteno¬
proteins is unknown, but at least in the isopods,
they may be involved in color change (Lee, 1966a,
1972).
There were therefore two basic interests in
initiating this study of canthaxanthin-carotenoproteins:
1) To compare them with the astaxanthin-caroteno-
proteins; and 2) To determine if there exists inter-
