interesting findings. First, the electrophoretic
patterns of the three green carotenoproteins inves¬
tigated are identical (Fig. 4), with the two lower
dark-staining bands (bands 3 and 4 in Fig. 4) repre¬
senting the carotenoprotein complex. The observa¬
tion that green color migrated to the positions
occupied by these two bands implies that this mole-
cule is composed of two subunits. Treatment of the
carotenoprotein with 6 M urea or acetone did not
change the electrophoretic pattern, although some
change in carotenoid-protein linkage was evidenced
in absorption spectra as there was a complete loss
of absorbance at 683 nm.
Furthermore, when samples of protein were
prestained with lipocrimson, the red stain never
grated away from the origin, as did the green color.
This finding suggests that the canthaxanthin-caro-

rchanskii,
e
ansis, I.k
tenoproteins of I. monter
a are not lipoproteins and that the
and I.1
resecat
lipocrimson stain remains attached to lipid-contam¬
inated protein at the ori
in. Perhaps the lipid
found associated with the isopod carotenoproteins
serves in some way to hold the subunits of the
molecule together, which are then quite easily disso¬
ciated upon electrophoresis.
