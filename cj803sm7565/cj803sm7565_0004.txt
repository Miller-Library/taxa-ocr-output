specific similarities between the canthaxanthin-
rotenoproteins of differont isopod species.
For this purpose, Idotea montereyensis (Maloney),
ta (Stimpson), and Idotea kirchanskii
Idotea rese
(Miller & Lee) - three closely related species of
ma
ine isopods - were used. The present studies
were undertaken to compare various properties of the
reen carotenoproteins isolated from three species
of marine idoteid isopods, including absorption
spectra, electrophoretic patterns, composition,
.
minimum molecular weight, and stability to light and
heat.
