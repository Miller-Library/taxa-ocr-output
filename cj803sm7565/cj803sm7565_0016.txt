content of lipid.
Although, as a result of the lipid contamination,
completely purified proteins were never obtained,
the finding that lipid contamination of the caroteno-
proteins is present to a considerable degree in all
species implies that these molecules have both
lipophilic and hydrophilic ends. Perhaps this duality
of properties has significance in color change and
other possible functions. It is noteworthy that the

the only species
carotenoprotein of I. monter

capable of undergoing color change (Lee, 1966a),
has the least lipid associated with it. That this
molecule can associate with both lipid and aqueous
environments may have bearing on such a process.

Furthermore, such a molecule might even facilitate
