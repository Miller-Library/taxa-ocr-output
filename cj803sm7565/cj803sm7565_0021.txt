appear in a wide variety of colors - for example,
crustacyanin is blue, ovoverdin is greon, and
ovorubin red; and 3) Prosthetic group; in addition
to differences in carotenoid prosthetic group,
some astaxanthin-proteins such as ovoverdin are
lipoproteins while present studies indicate the
isopod carotenoproteins to have no lipid as a
prosthetic group; both ovoverdin and ovorubin are
ycoproteins while to date it is not known if the
isopod canthaxanthin-proteins contain a carbohydrate
moiety.
Very preliminary evidence indicates the isopod
carotenoproteins to be of a much greater molecular
size than that of either crustacyanin (MW 380,000)
al., 1966), ovoverdin (MW 300,000)
(Cheesman
(Ceccaldi et al., 1966), or ovorubin (MW 330,000)
(Cheesman, 1958). The evidence suggests the isopod
canthaxanthin-proteins to have a molecular weight in
xoess of 480,000; however, this remains to be con¬
irmed on totally purified material.
