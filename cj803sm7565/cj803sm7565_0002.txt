INTRODUCTION
Carotenoproteins, complexes in which a carotenoid
and a protein are in stoichiometric combination,
were first discovered in the invertebrates in 1883
(Merejkowsky, 1883) and since have been shown to have
a very wide distribution (Cheesman et al., 1967).
o
Most study of the invertebrate carotenoproteli
ns has
centered on three proteins - crustacyanin, the blue
protein of the lobster carapace (Wald, Nathanson, Jencks,
& Tarr, 1948; Jencks & Buten, 1964; Cheesman, Zagalsky
& Ceccaldi, 1966), ovoverdin, the green pigment of
lobster eggs (Kuhn & Sorensen, 1938; Stern & Salomon,
1937, 1938), and ovorubin, the red protein of the
eggs of the gastropod Pomacea
inalicul
ata (Cheesman,
1958; Norden, 1962). Of these, crustacyanin has been
analyzed the most thoroughly, probably due to its
availability and ease of pur
ification. All of these
carotenoproteins have astaxanthin as their prosthetic
group and for quite some time it was believed that
astaxanthin was the only carotenoid found as a caro¬
tenoid prosthetic group in invertebrate caroteno¬
proteins.
In 1966, astaxanthin esters were found to be
the prosthetic group in the egg carotenoproteins in
