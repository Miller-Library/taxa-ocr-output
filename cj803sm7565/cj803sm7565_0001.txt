1. Green canthaxanthin-carotenoproteins were isoÂ¬
lated and partially purified from three species
7
of marine idoteid isopods - lootea monter
sis
(Maloney), Idotea resecata (Stimpson), and Idotea
kirchanskii (Miller and Lee).
The proteins have similar absorption maxima at
2.
280 nm. and 683 nm., similar electrophoretic
properties, and a molecular weight of greater
than 480,000.
3. Although shown not to be lipoproteins, the pro-
teins show both lipophilic and hydrophilic
properties.
4. A comparison of canthaxanthin-carotenoproteins
and astaxanthin-carotenoproteins is made.
