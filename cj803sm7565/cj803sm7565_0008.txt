of 60-120 amps., for three to five hours. Proteins
were stained for with Amido Black 10B and a lipo-
crimson prestain (Gurr Inc.) was used to determine
the presence of lipoproteins. All other procedures
were carried out as noted in E-C Technical Bulletin
No. 140 (E-C Apparatus Corp.).
Apoprotein
Protein complexes which had been purified by
passage through columns of Sephadex G-200 and re¬
precipitated with 70 percent ammonium sulfate were
treated with 6 M urea for one, fifteen, and 30 minute
intervals. Spectra were taken of the resulting
solutions and electrophoresis of protein samples
treated with 6 M urea for 30 minutes was performed,
sing 6 M urea-Cyanogum-41 gels and Tr
s-NaEDTA¬
Boric Acid-6 Murea buffer, pH 8.4.
In a subsequent experiment, Sephadex G-200
ified carotenoproteins were treated with equal
volumes of acetone; the white precipitate was centri¬
fuged, redissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0,
and run on electrophoresis using a normal Cyanogum-+
gel and Tris-NajEDTA-Boric Acid buffer, pH 8.4.
