The following materials were utilized: Sephadex
G-200 (Tharmacia, Inc.); DEAE-Cellex 50 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories); and Cyanogum-41 (E-C Apparatus Corp.).
All other chemicals were of reagent grade.
Phosphate buffers were prepared by mixing solutions

I KHyPO, and NagHPO, to the appropriate pH.

From 100-200 animals, all of which had been
maintained in the laboratory in cold aerated sea
water, were starved at least seven hours to remove
+
gut contents. They were subsequently frozen unoll
extracted. Green protein complexes were extracted
in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (KH,PO, + NagHPO,), pH 7.0
ing the method of Lee (1966a); the crude extract
was centrifuged at 12,000 RPM at 0Â°0. for one hour
to remove nonaqueous residues (Gilchrist, 1968).
Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the solution to
igit to 30 percent saturation and the resulting
bri
precipitate spun down and discarded. The green
itated
protein, which remained in solution, was prec
ith 70 percent ammonium sulfate, centrifuged and
redissolved in 0.001 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.
