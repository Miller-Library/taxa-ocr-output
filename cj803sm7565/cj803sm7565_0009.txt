Estimates of molecular sizes of the purified
carotenoproteins (purified by Sephadex G-200 fil¬
tration, DEAE-Cellex 50 Anion Exchange, and dialysis
against water) were obtained from a gel filtration
study.
A column of Sephadex G-200 (2.5 x 60 cm.) was
equilibrated with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0,
(flow rate was 18-20 ml. per hour) and was calibrated
with a series of standard proteins, as explained
by Cheesmane
t al. (1966) and Andrews (1964). Blue
dextran was used to determine the elution volume
of the column. A molecular size estimate was ob¬
plotting log molecular weight against elution
tained by
volume (Andrews, 1964).

Absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of the carotenoproteins
of all three species of isopods under study were
very similar. The spectra of the carotenoproteins,
at various stages of purification, are shown in
Fig. 1, 2, and 3. All display absorption maxima at
