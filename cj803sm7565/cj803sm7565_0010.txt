280 nm. and 683 nm. In crude protein preparations,
absorption below 500 nm. was usually so great that
the 280 nm. peak was occluded and corresponding
E200/683 ratios were either high or unobtainable.
With Sephadex G-200 purified proteins, character-
istic free carotenoid peaks were visible between
400-500 nm. and the absorption peaks at 280 nm. and
683 nm. became more clearly defined. At higher
levels of purity, for all the proteins, the E00/683
sios decreased to an even greater degree and the
400-500 nm. absorption was largely removed. It
should be noted that typically as canthaxanthin-
carotenoproteins reach higher stages of purity with
â€” +--
loss of contaminating proteins, the characteristic
00/683 ratio - the ratio of optical densities at
280 nm. to 683 nm. - is decreased and stabilized
and thus serves as one indicator of carotenoprotein
tio
purity. The observed reduction in the E
therefore may be attributable to removal of other
proteins, including possibly some lipoproteins, from
the crude carotenoprotein sample and the reduction in
free carotenoid absorbance to a removal of lipid and
lipid-dissolved carotenoids. These possibilities
are suggested by the offects of treatment of the
