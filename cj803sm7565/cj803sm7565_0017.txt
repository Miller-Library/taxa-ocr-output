tenoproteins have been observed to occur in the
prevensis (Lee, personal communica¬

tion, 1973) as well as in the carapace, suggesting
possible roles in transport or storage of nutrients.

The characteristic 280 nm. and 683 nm. absorption
anthaxanthin-carotenoprotein are
paks of the
likewise present in all species, but with varying
amounts of free carotenoid contamination, depending
on the species and degree of purification (Fig. 1,
2, and 3). This carotenoid-lipid contamination may
in fact be an artifact of the isolation procedure;
within the animal, as noted above, the environment
of the carotenoprotein could be either lipid or
aqueous in nature and therefore the degree of asso¬
ciation with lipid dissolved carotenoid in the animal
night be entirely different than that obtained in
ein extraction.
