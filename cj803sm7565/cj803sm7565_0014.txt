This work, however, can only be considered as
reliminary and more careful determination must be
made before a definitive statement of molecular
size can be made.

As a result of this brief investigation the
green carotenoproteins of the three marine idoteid
isopods - Idotea mo
itereyensis (Maloney), Idotea

resecata (Stimpson), and luotea kirchansk
i (Miller
Lee) - were all isolated (that of I. kirchansk
time) in at least a partially purified
for the firs
form and were shown to display remarkable inter-
specific similarities in absorption spectra, elecÂ¬
trophoretic patterns, molecular weight, and stability
to sunlight and heat; in addition, all were shown
to exhibit similar and unique behavior in both lipid
and aqueous environments.
Purification
Purification of the carotenoproteins represented
a major part of the work of this investigation. As
