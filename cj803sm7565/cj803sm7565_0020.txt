close interspecific similarity has been found only
in the egg carotenoproteins (Zagalsky, 1974). No
such relatedness has been observed in the carapace
astaxanthin-carotenoproteins so far studied.
A comparison of the invertebrate canthaxanthin¬
carotenoproteins and the astaxanthin-carotenoproteins
shows there to be some similarity (both classes of
proteins are carotenoid-proteins of high molecular
weight which bleach after varying amounts of time
in sunlight), but the two classes of proteins are
by no means identical (Table 2). Differences are
seen to exist in: 1) Absorption maxima; the typical
isopod carotenoprotein absorbances at 280 nm. and
683 nm. (in the pure form) are in contrast to the
wide variety of absorption maxima seen in the
hin-proteins (for example at 278 nm., 476 nm.,
aal
and 660 nm. for ovoverdin); in addition, the astaxan-
thin-proteins appear to have no lipid-carotenoid
ssociations as do the isopod carotenoproteins in the
impure form as evidenced by a lack of wide absorbance
in the 400-500 nm. range; 2) Color; the canthaxanthin¬
proteins tend to be green to blue-green in color,
depending upon the amount of lipid-carotenoid
association, while the astaxanthin-carotenoproteins
