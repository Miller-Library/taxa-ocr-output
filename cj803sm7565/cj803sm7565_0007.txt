buffer, pH 7.0 and recentrifuged to remove denatured
tein and lipid.
Dialysis of the Sephadex G-200 purified protein
was performed in distilled water with stirring and
frequent changes of water for two days at 5Â°0. under
conditions of minimal illumination. The resulting
precipitated protein was centrifuged, redissolved in
0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and recentrifuged.
