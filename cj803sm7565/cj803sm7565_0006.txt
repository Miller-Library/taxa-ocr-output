The crude protein extract was placed in concen¬
trated solution on columns of Sephadex G-200 and
eluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Columns
were approximately 2.5 x 60 cm. and were thoroughly
equilibrated in the cold with 0.1 M phosphate buffer,
pH 7.0 before the protein solutions were added.
The partially purified green protein was resatur¬
ated with 70 percent ammonium sulfate, centrifuged,
and redissolved in a small amount of 0.001 M phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0. The green solution was placed on
DEAE-Cellex 50 Anion Exchange columns, prepared by
the method of Lee (1966a), and was eluted with a
igth of the perfusing
stepwise increase in ionic sti
phosphate buffer.
urification of the Sephadex G-200 treated
protein complexes was also attempted by means of
treatment with diethyl ether and dialysis against
istilled water. Diethyl ether treatment involved
lightly shaking the protein solution with two volumes
of diethyl ether, centrifuging the mixture for five
minutes at 0°0., and removing the upper ether layer
with suction; the lower aqueous layer was saturated
with 70 percent ammonium sulfate, centrifuged, and the
resulting precipitate redissolved in 0.001 M phosphate
