successive stages of purification (Table 1), the
proteins were never completely purified. The
major difficulty seemed to be lipid contamination,
occurring in varying degrees with the respective
species. Lipid and lipid-dissolved carotenoid con¬
tamination was evidonced by the behavior of the
proteins after treatment with diethyl ether and after
dialysis against water. As a result of both of
these procedures, the E/683 ratios of all proteins
decreased (Table 1), indicating a loss of contami¬
ating protein, perhaps lipoprotein in nature, and
the protein solutions tended to change in color
from green to blue or blue-green, the latter implying
that lipid and dissolved carotenoid were being re¬
moved from association with the carotenoprotein.

Lipid was, in fact, detected on the dialysis bags
after such treatment.
The levels of lipid contamination varied with
the species. Based on absorption spectra and mobil-
ity on DEAE-Cellex 50 columns, it appeared that the
e
sis contained the
carotenoprotein of 1. monter
least lipid contamination, while those of 1. kircha
