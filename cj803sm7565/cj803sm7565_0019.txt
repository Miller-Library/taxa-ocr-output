These findings are in contrast to the situation
found in crustacyanin, an astaxanthin-protein of
large molecular weight which appears as a homoge-
neous band upon electrophoresis under normal condi¬
tions (Cheesman et al., 1966); however, when treated
with a strong denaturing agent such as 6 Murea a
number of bands appear in the electrophoretic pattern,
indicating dissociation into subunits (Cheesman, e
1966). The fact that no such increase in electro¬
phoretic protein bands occurs upon treatment of
isopod carotenoproteins with 6 M urea implies that
erent
the association of subunits is of a much dif
nature than that seen in crustacyanin.

The present studies therefore indicate quite
close interspecific similarity between the green
canthaxanthin-carotenoproteins of three species
of marine idoteid isopods; these proteins are pre¬
dominantly cuticular in nature, although they occur
in other body regions as well as in the eggs.
In addition to perhaps indicating a similarity in
function of these isopod carotenoproteins, this
relationship is in contrast to that found in the
vertebrate astaxanthin-carotenoproteins in which
