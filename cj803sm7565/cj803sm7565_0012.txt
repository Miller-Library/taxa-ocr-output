in Fig. 4. At all stages of purification and in
all species three distinct protein bands were present.
These are represented as bands 1, 3, and 4 on Fig. 4.

fication of the carotenoprotein in I. m
The band which remained at the origin (band 1, Fig. 4),
though originally believed to represent the caroteno¬
ein band, appears, as a result of this investi¬
prot
ation, to be denatured protein or protein held
back by lipid contamination. Evidence indicates
in fact the green carotenoprotein of all three
that
species is represented solely by the two lower bands
(bands 3 and 4, Fig. 4); green color was observed
to move to these positions during the course of
several electrophoretic runs. Upon treatment of the
protein samples with 6 M urea, though a loss of
absorbance at 683 nm. was noted, indicating a change
