in carotenoid-protein linkage, there was no change
in the number of bands present, suggesting that
the isopod carotenoproteins are not polymers made
up of different molecular weight subunits as
commonly seen in crustacyanin (Cheesman,
al.,
1966). Similar results were obtained with acetone
denatured protein as well.
Lipocrimson prestain always remained at the
origin and was never observed to migrate down the
ing that the isopod caroteno-
gel, againsug
proteins are not lipoproteins, although they do
ppear to have strong lipophilic properties.

greater than 480,000, perhaps as high as 1,200,000 (Fig:5).
