carotenoproteins with diethyl ether and dialysis
against water. Both of these processes firs
decreased the E/683 ratio and second removed
lipid and dissolved carotenoid, as evidenced by
detection of lipid on the dialysis bags and by the
change in color of the protein solution from green
to blue.
fic
tion
The purity of the carotenoproteins was deter-
1280
mined by absorption spectra (E /683) and electro¬
phoresis, each of which was performed at successive
stages of purification. The five major stages of
purity obtained for each protein are shown in Table 7
with corresponding E
0/683 ratios. As the proteins
were passed through the various purification pro¬
cesses, the E/683 ratios decreased but never
completely stabilized. Noteworthy is the fact that
tereye
only the carotenoprotein of I.
is could
be passed through DEAE-Cellex 50 Anion Exchange
columns; that of I. kirchanskii remained immobile
on the column, while that of I. resecata denatured
on the column.
