preliminary and much work is yet needed to gain
further insight into the structure and function
of these canthaxanthin-carotenoproteins. However,
these studies do indicate that the invertebrate
canthaxanthin- and astaxanthin-carotenoproteins are
quite different in a number of respects and that
there exists striking interspecific similarities
between the carotenoproteins of three closely
related species of marine idoteid isopods.
