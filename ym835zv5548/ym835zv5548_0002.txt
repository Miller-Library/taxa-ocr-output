ABSTRACT
Tigriopus californicus exhibits a heat shock response under
thermal and osmotic stress. At least 3 heat shock proteins (hsps)
are induced under conditions of thermal stress at 30.1Â°c.
least 2 hsps are induced by T. californicus in 508 and 2x instant
ocean, the latter causing greater hsp induction. The proteins
identified under thermal stress were 2 hsp 60's and 1 hsp 70. The
proteins identified under osmotic stress were 1 hsp 60 and 1 hsp
70. In both conditions hsp synthesis occured rapidly, most likely
under 1 hour. All analysis of protein induction was done by
autoradiography using L-[32S)methionine and was supplemented by
Western analysis. Identification of hsps in T. californicus will
provide the basis for furthur study of hsps in invertebrates and
elucidate the role of hsps in the stress response.
Heat shock proteins (hsps) are highly conserved proteins produced by an
organism under the presence of stress. Stress may come in many different
varieties, including changes in temperature, osmolarity, light exposure, or
oxygen levels. A cellular response within the organism produces a series of
heat shock proteins (hsps), identifiable on the basis of their size and
primary structure, to protect the organism from the deleterious effects of
stress. Functionally, hsps may serve as constitutive proteins that regulate
intracellular traffic of other proteins. Hsps may also function as molecular
chaperones and aid in the assembly of immunoglobulins by protecting an unbound
heavy chain as the light chain is assembled. Finally, hsps may be induced
under shock to transport proteins in and out of intracellular organelles, bind
and protect proteins vulnerable to proteases, remove degraded proteins, or
refold proteins that have lost their functional tertiary structure. More
specifically, many hsps have bound to themselves ATP which when hydrolyzed
provides the energy necessary to refold or repair degraded protein (1).
