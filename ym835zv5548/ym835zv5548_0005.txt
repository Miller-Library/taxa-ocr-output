supernatant was removed and 10uL samples were used for protein determination
(3) and radioactive count analysis.
The heat shock time course experiment occurred in an identical manner as
above, but with the addition of 2 tubes of T. californicus homogenized at hour
1 and hour 2.
Radiolabeling of T. californicus proteins during salinity shock.
Protein synthesis of T. californicus in 508, lx, and 2x artifical seawater
(Instant Ocean, Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH) was also examined using L¬
[°98methionine. Three tubes containing T. californicus identical to the ones
described above were acclimated in 508 instant ocean for 24 hours prior to
experimentation. At time zero, 50uCi of radioactive methionine was diluted
into 100uL of 2x seawater and added immediately to the test tube upon transfer
of the animals into 2x instant ocean. Animals in the two remaining tubes were
radiolabeled in the same manner using the appropriate instant ocean
concentration (508 or 1x). The specimens were left undisturbed for 3 hours to
allow for radioactive methionine incorporation. All tubes were kept in a
18.9°C water bath. Washing, homogenization, protein determination, and
radioactive count determination all were done similar to the methods described
in heat shock experimentation.
The salinity time course experiment occurred in an identical manner as
above, with the addition of 4 tubes (2-508 instant ocean and 2-1x instant
ocean) of T. californicus homogenized at hour 2, hour 3, and hour 4.
SDS-PAGE. After the the supernatant was isolated, protein was solubilized
in 2x SDS buffer (4) containing dithiothreitol and boiled for 3 minutes.
Another radioactive count determination was performed following
solubilization. Protein was then either stored in a -20°C freezer or used
immediately for SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
