Fig. 4. Salinity shock time course. Autoradiograph of equally counted
(248,240cpm) radiolabeled protein from T. californicus. Lane A: control
protein labeled with radioactive methionine in 508 instant ocean. Lanes B, C,
and D: shocked protein labeled with radioactive methionine in lx instant ocean
and homogenized at 2, 3, and 4 hours respectively. Lanes E, F, and G: shocked
protein labeled with radioactive methionine in 2x instant ocean and
homogenized at 2, 3, and 4 hours respectively. Dashed lines indicate proteins
induced over basal levels. Molecular weight markers explained in legend to
Fig. 1. Gel exposed for 48hrs.
