filtered seawater. The tubes were then placed in a thermal gradient having
temperatures ranging from 9.7°c-42.3°C in order to determine the optimum
temperature for heat shock. Survival under these conditions was then observed
for 4 hours. Observations occurred every 10 min. for the first 2 hours,
followed by observations every 30 min. for the subsequent 2 hours. The
criterion for optimal heat shock temperature was the highest temperature at
which T. californicus sustained survival throughout the 4 hours.
Optimum heat shock temperature was concluded to be 30.1°C. Control
temperature was set at 18.9°C, close to the animal's normal seawater
temperature. All subsequent experiments were carried out using two water
baths, one set at the heat shock temperature and one at the control
temperature.
Radiolabeling of T. californicus proteins during heat shock.
Protein synthesis in T. californicus at 18.9°C and during heat shock at 30.1°0
was examined using L-[32S]methionine (Amersham, Arlington, Il1.). Two tubes
each containing approximately 300 T. californicus in 5 ml of filtered seawater
were acclimated at 18.9°C for 24 hours prior to experimentation. At time
zero, 50uCi of radioactive methionine was diluted into 100uL of seawater and
added immediately to the test tube upon transfer to 30.1°C. Control animals
were labeled at 18.9°C, but in an otherwise identical manner. Both tubes were
left undisturbed for 3 hours for the specimens to incorporate the radioactive
methionine. Radioactive labeling of proteins was stopped by washing the
animals 3 times with 2ml of 0.2M PBS-methionine. Homogenization of T
californicus occurred in a 2ml glass homogenizer (Radnoti, Monrovia, CA) using
200uL of homogenization buffer (10mL PBS/10mM EDTA, 50 uL PMSF, 1OuL
pepstatin, 10uL leupeptin, 100uL chymostatin, and 50uL of NP-40). The
homogenized sample was then centrifuged at 18,000G for 10 min. The
