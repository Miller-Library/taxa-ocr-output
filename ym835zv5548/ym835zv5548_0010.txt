utilized by the organism to overcome its hypo-osmotic pressure by increasing
its internal solute concentration (6).
At least two different hsps, hsp 60 and hsp 70, have been shown to
undergo induction when T. californicus has been exposed to thermal and osmotic
stress. It may be assumed that other types of stressors including pH
variance, anoxia, heavy metals, and pollutants will also cause the induction
of these hsps (7). As discussed in the introduction, these hsps are vital to
an organism's survival under stress. Hsp 60, for instance, may 1) keep
polypeptides in their unfolded state to facilitate their transport across
membranes or 2) control proper folding and unfolding of denatured proteins
(8). Hsp 70, minimally examined in invertebrates, comes in two main varieties
in eukaryotes: hsp 73 that is constitutively produced and hsp 72 that is
produced under stress (8). In the T. californicus, induction of a smaller hsp
70 was apparent, especially under heat shock conditions. These two hsps
expedite intracellular trafficking of proteins and stabilize protein structure
under normal conditions, but also facilitate synthesis and assembly of new
proteins that have been destroyed by shock and remove irreversibly denatured
proteins (8). Since hsps are so highly conserved and are present in all
organisms, understanding the mechanism by which they operate will provide
significant insight into not only how T. californicus deals with stress, but
how many organisms deal with stress.
