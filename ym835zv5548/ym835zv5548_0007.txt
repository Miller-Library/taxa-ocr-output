control temperature (18.9째C). Lane B shows protein incorporation of
radioactive methionine at the heat shock temperature (30.1째C). Proteins
indicated 1 and 2 show increased induction over basal levels in the heat shock
condition. One or more smaller hsp 70's were induced under heat shock
(protein 1) and two hsp 60's were induced (protein 2). One hsp 60 at 58kD,
produced constituently in the control, was enhanced in the heat shock
condition while another hsp 60 at 60kD, faintly produced in the control, was
greatly enhanced under heat shock. Figure 2 is an autoradiograph of a Western
nitrocellulose membrane containing equal T. californicus protein. Proteins
indicated 1 and 2 all show increased induction over basal levels under heat
shock similar to Fig. 1. Lane pairs (A and A', B and B', C and C', D and D')
of control and heat shock protein (respectively) show decreased overall
protein synthesis at 18.9째C in the face of increased hsp production at 30.1째c.
Figure 3 is an autoradiograph of a heat shock time course. All four lanes
were loaded with equal cpm (236,468cpm) of radioactive protein. Proteins 1,
2, 3, and 4 show increased synthesis after 1, 2, and 3 hours under heat shock
as shown in lanes B, C, and D. Again as in Fig. 1, induction of one or more
smaller hsp 70's (protein 1) occurs along with induction of 2 hsp 60's: one at
58kD and one at 60kD (prptein 2). Protein 3 indicates an induced protein of
49kD not apparent in the control and not seen in other autoradiographs. All
proteins 1-3 are consistently synthesized over the 3 hour time course with the
exception of hsp 70 (protein 1) at hour 2 (lane C) where protein induction
returns to levels similar to that of the control.
Hsp induction under various salinity conditions.
Quantitative
differences in protein induction between osmotically stressed and nonstresssed
T. californicus are apparent when autoradiographs of SDS-polyacrylamide gels
are compared. Figure 4 is an autoradiograph of a salinity time course. Lane
