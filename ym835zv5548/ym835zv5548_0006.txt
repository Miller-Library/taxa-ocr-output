electrophoresis). SDS-PAGE (108 polyacrylamide) was carried out by the method
of Laemmli (4). Gels were dried using a vacuum gel drying apparatus (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Richmond, CA) at 80°C for 2hrs. The gels were then exposed to
Kodak XAR-5 film at room temperature for 24-72hrs. Protein molecular weight
markers were from Sigma Co., St. Louis, Mo.
Immunoblotting. Western blots of T. californicus protein were done
according to standard technique (5). To probe for hsp 60, rabbit anti-hsp 60
from Synechococcus sp. (StressGen, Victoria, B.C., Canada) was used as the
primary antibody followed by an anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma Immuno,
St. Louis, Mo.). To probe for hsp 70, antibody 3A3 (Dr. Sean Murphy,
Northwestern Univ., Illinois) was used as the primary antibody followed by an
anti-mouse IgG from goat as the secondary antibody (Sigma Immuno).
Proteins transferred by Western procedure onto nitrocellulose were
exposed to x-ray film in the same manner as dried gels.
RESULTS
Temperature for heat shock and hsp induction. At 30.1°C T.
californicus sustained swimming activity without instant or gradual death as
in higher temperatures. Therefore, all heat shock experiments used 18.9°0
seawater as the control condition and 30.1°C as the heat shock condition.
Quantitative differences in protein induction between thermally stressed and
nonstresssed T. californicus are apparent when autoradiographs of SDS¬
polyacrylamide gels are compared. Figure 1 is an autoradiograph of an SDS¬
PAGE gel of T. californicus. Each lane contains 87,161 counts per minute
(cpm) of radiolabeled protein as determined by a Packard 2200CA scintillation
counter. Lane A shows protein incorporation of radioactive methionine at the
