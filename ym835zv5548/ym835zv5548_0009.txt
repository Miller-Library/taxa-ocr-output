In addition to hsp production, general protein synthesis was reduced
under thermal stress as seen in Fig. 2. Most likely this reduction of overall
protein synthesis occurs so that amino acids are exclusively used to
synthesize only proteins that are needed - hsps - and to prevent the
unnecessary production of proteins that would inevitably undergo thermal
degradation. All these events occur within 1 hour as shown in the time course
(Fig. 3) where all three hsps are greatly enhanced at hour 1. The
inconsistent results of the time course in regards to 1) the thermally induced
49kD protein (Fig. 3, protein 3) not seen in other autoradiographs and 2) hsp
70 reduction (Fig. 3, lane C) after 2 hours of heat shock are anomalies that
need to be reconfirmed.
Under varying salinity conditions T. californicus one would expect the
condition of lx instant ocean to be the least shocking to T. californicus due
to its similar salt concentration to actual seawater. This assumption indeed
proved to be true. Induction of hsps occurred only in 508 and 2x instant
ocean. Even though the animals were acclimated into 508 seawater for 24hrs.,
they still maintained hsp production. Shown by autoradiography (Fig. 4) and
supported by Western analysis of hsp 60 and hsp 70, exposure to 2x instant
ocean caused the most dramatic induction of hsp 60 and hsp 70 followed by 508
instant ocean. As seen in the time course, T. californicus in 2x instant
ocean appeared to adapt somewhat after 4 hours of exposure (Fig. 4, Lane G)
which closely resembled exposure to 508 instant ocean (Fig. 4, Lane A). This
adaptation in 2x instant ocean is interesting when looking at the induction of
smaller proteins over the 4 hour time course. In contrast to heat shock where
smaller proteins were reduced, under osmotic stress smaller non-hsps are
synthesized in increased amounts.
Possibly these smaller proteins are
