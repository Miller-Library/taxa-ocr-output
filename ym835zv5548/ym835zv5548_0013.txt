FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1. Autoradiograph of equally counted (87,161cpm) radiolabeled protein
from T. californicus in lanes A and B. Lane A: total protein labeled with
radiolabeled methionine at 18.9°c.
Lane B: total protein labeled with
radioactive methionine at 30.1°c.
Dashed lines indicate proteins induced over basal levels. Protein molecular
weight markers (Sigma Co., St. Louis, I11.) are at 84kD and 58kD. Gel exposed
for 72hrs.
Fig. 2. Autoradiograph of a nitrocellulose membrane containing equal amounts
of T. californicus protein: 10ug in lanes A and A', 15ug in lanes B and B',
25ug in lanes C and C', and 58ug in lanes D and D'. Lanes A-D: protein
labeled with radioactive methionine at 18.9°C. Lanes A'-D': protein labeled
with radioactive methionine at 30.1°C. Dashed lines indicate proteins induced
over basal levels. Molecular weight markers explained in legend to Fig. 1.
Membrane exposed for 96hrs.
Fig. 3. Heat shock time course. Autoradiograph of equally counted
(236, 468cpm) radiolabeled protein from T. californicus. Lane A: control
protein labeled with radioactive methionine at 18.9°C. Lanes B, C, D: heat
shock protein labeled with radioactive methionine at 30.1°C and homogenized at
1, 2, and 3 hours respectively.
Dashed lines indicate proteins induced over basal levels. Molecular weight
markers explained in legend to Fig. 1. Gel exposed for 24hrs.
