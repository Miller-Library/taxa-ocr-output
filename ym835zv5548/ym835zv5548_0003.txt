Since the heat shock response has been shown to be universal, from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes, Tigriopus californicus, a marine crustacean, was
also expected to demonstrate the heat shock response. T. californicus was
chosen as the organism for experimentation because it is easily kept in the
laboratory and available in large quantities. More commonly called copepods,
T. californicus can tolerate tremendous fluctuations in temperature and
salinity. Previous study reports that T. californicus may survive in
seawater temperatures up to 40°C and salt concentrations up to 6008 (2).
During the summer months, increased ambient temperature and a high degree of
evaporation would cause these environmental changes. This study proposed to
examine the heat shock response of T. californicus under various conditions of
temperature and salinity, specifically evaluating what hsps are produced.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Storage Conditions. T. californicus were collected
approximately every other week from one high splash pool at Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove, California. The pool's temperature was found to be
18.9°C. Animals were concentrated using a household strainer and placed in a
5 L transparent container filled with filtered seawater. The container was
kept within the laboratory, most commonly at a temperature of 19°0. The
animals were fed ground mussel 3 times a week and kept near a window that
allowed natural exposure to light and dark. Filtered water was changed
periodically when T. californicus death was apparent.
Determination of the heat shock temperature. Three hundred T.
californicus, without regard to sex, were divided into groups of 20 and placed
in 15 large test tubes (Kimax 5.5 x 1.0cm) containing approximately 5ml of
