subsequently in 5 days time had fully regenerated its gut. This is consistent
with Claudia Mills' report at a meeting at the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Jellyfest (4/11/92) report that Solmissus will regenerate damaged parts of its
body in situ as long as it can get adequate nourishment.) Third, the kriesels
were not pressurized, thus keeping Solmissus under substantially less
pressure from the midwater environment. Although Solmissus seemed
unaffected when brought up to the surface, perhaps the change in pressure
had more long-term effects. For instance, because the bell deflated in older
animals, the loss of pressure may have enabled the mesoglea in the bell to
leak out. i.e. In situ the pressure may keep the mesoglea in the bell secure
within the exoderm. Fourth, the kriesel was part of a circulating sea water
system which recycled the water through 3 tanks containing other midwater
species and the water quality may have deteriorated in the closed system.
It has been hypothesized that because the prey density is very low in
the midwater environment, many medusae spread their tentacles and swim
in order to increase the area in which it can contact potential prey items
(Larson et al. 1989; Madin, 1988). The observed feeding behavior of swimming
both in conjunction with and alternating with feeding postures of Solmissus
(see figures la, b,c, d, e) is consistent with this hypothesis. In each of the
feeding postures, the tentacles are extended wide and increase the volume of
water swept while swimming to touch any nearby prey. The active
swimming enables Solmissus to forage in different areas in the midwater. It
is advantageous for Solmissus to move around because the prey density in
the water column is low and also patchy; thus, the probability of encounter in
one area is proportionally small. Solmissus additionally decreases the
amount of time taken away from fishing for prey by sometimes swimming
