specimens which had bells of 4 inches diameter were too big for the kriesel
tank and were preserved during the first few days after capture. Three which
were damaged prior to capture and preserved after capture. The eight
remaining Solmissus specimens remained in condition adequate for
experiments between 6 and 14 days. I determined that animals were adequate
for feeding experiments if they had five or more tentacles. As Solmissus
became unhealthy, the tentacles broke off, the bell lost its shape becoming
flaccid, and the animal lost its ability to swim. However, the animals
continued to pulse on the bottom of the tank for several days even when
shapeless and unable to swim. Solmissus behaved the same in the red light
or under a white flashlight.
Observations:
Of the 103 sightings of Solmissus in the video catalog 23 either had a
prey item in the gut, in the tentacles, or in the mouth. Four of these were
preying on Beroe, three on Cydippid, two on Nanomia, one on
Pleurobrachia, one on a Euphausiid, nine on unidentified ctenophores, two
on unidentified siphonophores, and two on unidentified gelatinous
creatures. Two of these video segments included Solmissus actually feeding
on Heurobrachia and Nanomia. Of two previously preserved specimens,
one had a Pleurobrachia in the gut.
On the ship, I observed Solmissus from 200m to 926m. All of the
Solmissus observed had empty guts. Approximately one half were
swimming with tentacles extended and the other half were immobile with
tentacles extended. Most were in feeding postures and did not change from
these postures unless the current from the RÃ–V disturbed the animal.
