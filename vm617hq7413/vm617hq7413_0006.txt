Methods: The 13 Solmissus specimens studied in the lab were collected by the
ROV Ventana on 8 dives in the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. The
specimens were collected in detritus samplers which were kept and sealed
until brought into the laboratory. Four of the ROV dives were at latitude
36 42°22“, longitude 122 03’30“, one was at lat. 36 44·56", long 122 0401", one
was at lat 36 47’12“, long. 122 0232", and two at lat 36 42’43", long.122 03115'
(see table 1.) The ROV also caught the Nanomia biyuga and Paraphyllina
ransoni? The brine shrimp and Beroe abyssicola were provided by Monterey
Bay Aquarium, and the Fleurobrachia bachei from labs in Santa Barbara.
The Solmissus specimens were kept together in one plankton kriesel
tank with a circulating current (Hamner, 1990.) The number of Solmissus in
the tank during the period of study varied from 1 to 4. The prey items were
kept together in plastic containers of chilled seawater until the time of the
experiments. The tank and plastic containers were located at the Moss
Landing Marine Operations Station of MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute) in a dark, temperature regulated room at 5 degrees Celsius.
The water that circulated through the kriesel was kept at 6 degrees Celsius,
and the salinity was checked every day to keep a constant 345 parts/thousand.
The animals were observed under red light and a white flashlight.
To collect data, I utilized videos from past ROV dives and their
preserved specimens, observed video transmissions from the RÖV on the
ship the Point Lobos, and kept tanks with live collected specimens. From the
MBARI video library, I analyzed a catalog of Solmissus interactions with
other deep sea animals, and watched selected video series. 1 went to sea on 6
cruises in order to make in situ observations and collect Solmissus and
potential prey. On each dive, the RÖV was down for approximately 5.5 hours
making my total shipboard observations 33 hours.
