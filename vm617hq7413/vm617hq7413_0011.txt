the gut. During digestion, this gas-sac moved up toward the pinched-shut
mouth of the Solmissus (see figure 3.) Slowly, traces of the sac disappeared.
In addition, pieces of broken-up comb rows from Beroe seemed to follow the
same pattern of moving up to the pinched mouthand also slowly
disappeared.
Discussion: There are several possibilities as to why the Solmissus
specimens stayed healthy enough to do experiments with for less than two
weeks. Four main ones could include: (1) damage from the kriesel tank, (2)
close proximity with other Solmissus specimens in the kriesel, (3) inadequate
pressure, and (4) contaminated water. Öften, while circulating with the
current in the kriesel, Solmissus would bump into the tank filter and scrape
along the rough surface possibly incurring physical damage to the bell and/ or
tentacles. Solmissus sometimes scraped along the bottom the tank picking up
detritus which could weigh down the tentacles and break them. Additionally
Solmissus frequently swam into the sides and bottom of the tank, again
possibly physically damaging itself. These hypotheses would explain the fact
that the first signs of an unhealthy specimen was broken tentacles. However,
these speculations are made without knowledge of the natural life-span of
Solmissus or the age of the captured specimens.
Second, because often several Solmissus specimens were in the tank
together, they would come in contact with each other's tentacles and
sometimes become entangled. Not only could this break off some of the
tentacles, but I observed one animal become entangled in another’s tentacles
and rip out its own gut while struggling free. (Interestingly, this animal
