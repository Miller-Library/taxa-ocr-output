prey density is low: (1) They were able to eat extremely large prey relative to
their own size; (2) They released their tentacles into feeding position as soon
as the prey was secure in the mouth; (3) They resumed swimming as soon as
the prey was secure; (4) They extended several foraging tentacles while
swimming with prey already in gut, and (5) They were able to ingest a second
prey item while digesting a previous capture.
In the case of the 1 inch S. incisa ingesting the 75 inch/ 5 inch B.
abyssicola, S. incisa consumed a prey item almost as large as itself. The tissue
of gut, mouth and lips have adapted to be flexible enough to engulf prey close
to the size of Solmissus. By being able to distend the gut so far, the Solmissus
increases both the size apectrum and meal size of prey available in relation to
the animals it encounters in the midwater.
My experiments suggest that in order to increase its chances of
opportunistic feeding, the Solmissus returns to its feeding postures and
foraging as soon as physically possible after feeding. Even before the prey has
been fully engulfed by the mouth and gut, the Solmissus resumes its fishing.
Then, if it contacts another prey item in its foraging the body has adapted so
that it can continue to digest while ingesting. Perhaps the motion of cilia
which brings the prey into the mouth from the tentacles keeps pushing the
digesting food farther into the gut so that more food can enter without letting
the digesting food escape out the flared mouth. On several occasions in
video and in the laboratory while resuming swimming Solmissus would
extend 2-3 tentacles above the bell to catch additional prey. These abilities
enable Solmissus to take advantage of opportunities to feed at all times
except the short periods in which it secures the prey in the mouth and lips.
