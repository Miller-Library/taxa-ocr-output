From my observations in the lab, I identified the stereotypical feeding
pattern of the Solmissus. Half the time it incorporated swimmin,
periodically, stopping and floating with tentacles extended in one of four
feeding positions. The other half it swam while extending its tentacles (see
figured 1a,b,c,d,e.) Solmissus swims with the bell in front by contracting the
velum and trailing the tentacles behind the disk.
A further laboratory observation was that when stressed by touch with
the rim of a glass jar, handling or change of tank Solmissus bioluminesced a
purple-blue color for a few seconds. Two separate animals seemed to leak
bioluminescent droplets into the tank when they were stressed.
I identified 4 of the Solmissus specimens as S. incisa, but the other 11
specimens did not correspond to the descriptions of previously described
Solmissus species in literature. There were two groups of Solmissus in the
unidentified 11: Three specimens with a purple ring around the edge of the
lappets (here as species 1,) and the other 7 which were colorless (here as
species 2)
Feeding Experiments:
The animals did not attempt to eat Macrocystis kelp blades even when
the kelp connected with the tentacles. WhenSolmissus caught a dead
Paraphyllina ransoni?, in the tentacles, it began the feeding behavior of
puckering the lips to surround the food each of three times when it caught
the medusa (see figure 2,) but did not ingest it. Additionally, when Solmissus
caught Fleurobrachia bachei, Solmissus began to pucker the lips, but could
not hold onto the prey with its damaged tentacles. I was able to feed four
Solmissus live, gelatinous food. Two Solmissus, one S. incisa with a bell 2.5
inches in diameter and one species 2 with a bell 1.5 inches in diameter, ate
