Abstract: Solmissus spp, a narcomedusa found commonly throughout the
midwater region from the surface to 1000m may play an integral role in the
midwater food web. Foraging feeding and digestive studies in situ and in
the laboratory indicate that Solmissus has adapted to living in a low prey
density environment by behaviors which increase prey encounter time and
area. These behaviors include extending tentacles and swimming while
foraging resuming foraging while still in the ingestive process; eating a very
large range of prey sizes; and ingesting more than one prey item at a time.
Thirteen Solmissus spp. were collected using a Remote Operated Vehicle in
the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. In the laboratory, these specimens
were kept in tanks and fed various shallow and deep water flora and fauna.
In the laboratory, Solmissus preyed on Beroe abyssicola and Nanomia biyuga
which they digested in 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
