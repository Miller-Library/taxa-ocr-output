midwater gelatinous animals in laboratory environment which resemble the
mid-water conditions.
The information that exists on the feeding behavior of Solmissus is
scattered and comes from several researchers' in situ observations. On ROV
dives, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) researchers have
seen a Solmissus feeding on a Beroe (P. Ctenophora) and on a Nanomia (P.
Cnidaria). Mills and Goy (1988) reported the pteropod Cavolina in the gut of
Solmissus albescens, (Larson et al, 1989) saw comb rows of an unidentified
ctenophore in the gut of a S incisa, and Mackie and Mackie (1963) saw S.
marshalli feed on the hydromedusa Euphysa. However, these observations
are rare; the vast majority of observed animals have had empty guts. This
study was undertaken to clarify the feeding behavior of the narcomedusa,
Solmissus sp.
Because the midwater may have few and widely separated potential
prey items, I hypothesized that Solmissus must be an opportunistic predator.
In order to survive in a habitiat with low prey density, Solmissus must
exhibit behaviors which take advantage of as much prey-encounter time as
possible. 1 proposed a set of behaviors which represent general adaptions of
an opportunistic Solmissus: (1) They would be able to swim while fishing
with tentacles (2) They would be able to eat a wide size range of prey items; (3)
They would release their tentacles into feeding position as soon as the prey
was secure in the mouth; (4) They would resume swimming as soon as the
prey was secure; (5) They would feed on a variety of types of prey (6) They
would be able to ingest a second prey item while digesting a previous capture.
I carried out in situ observations and conducted feeding experiments on
Solmissus held in kriesels to determine these behaviors.
