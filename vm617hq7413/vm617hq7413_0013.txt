with tentacles extended above the bell for prey capture with food already in
the gut.
Solmissus proved to be carnivorous in keeping with studies done on
other medusae (Larson, 1979). They did not eat the dead food they came in
contact with. The reason they did not eat it could have been that the P
ransoni? was not part of their diet; however, because they did pucker their
lips and begin moving the mouth out towards the prey, it seems as if they
would have consumed the medusa had it stayed in the tentacles. However,
each time the contact occured, within 10-20 minutes, the Solmissus released
the medusa. Because P ransoni? was dead, the release could not have
happened from a struggle as in cases with N biyuga. I did not attempt to feed
Solmissus dead Beroe or Nanomia.
Madin (1988) suggested that tentaculate predators select their prey by
stimulation of the tentacles after the prey is caught. Madin related this in the
context of very strong stimulation by the animal touching the tentacles may
imply another animal preying on the medusa and trigger an escape response
rather than a feeding response. Less strong stimulation would trigger the
feeding response. In the case of the dead food, it is possible that in absence of
a stimulation or tugging from the prey, the Solmissus aborts the feeding
response and releases the dead prey. Because there is much marine snow and
detritus in the water column which Solmissus could come in contact with
during foraging the animal must have means to distinguish prey from
organic waste. It would not be advantageous for Solmissus to fire the
nematocysts when it contacted each piece of detritus. The animal would both
expend energy in the encounter and waste foraging time and energy
producing more nematocysts.
