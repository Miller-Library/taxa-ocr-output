Nanomia biyuga 3.5 inches and 4.5 inches in length, respectively. Each
digested the N. biyuga in 36 hours. Two different S. incisa, one 2 inches and
one 1 inch in diameter, each ate Beroe abyssicola. The larger S. incisa ate a B.
abyssicola of diameter 25 inches and length 5 inches, and the smaller
Sincisa ate a B. abyssicola with the dimensions 5 inches and 75 inches. Each
digested B. abyssicola in 24 hours (see table 2.) While digesting the B.
abyssicola, both of S. incisa caught a N. biyuga and ingested the zooids of the
siphonophore (the nectophores and pneumatophore were not ingested). In
the beginning of the ingestion period the swimming of Solmissus was
inhibited.
When Solmissus ingested the N. biyuga prey, it directed the ingested
zooids to the edge of the gut to the stomach pouches while the rest of the prey
was still being ingested. With B. abyssicola, Solmissus generally positioned
the prey slightly off center of the gut after ingestion so that one side of B.
abyssicola contacted the stomach pouches. Most of the digestion and
decomposition of B. abyssicola took place in the flaccid, distended gut (see
figure 3.)
During ingestion of both the N. biyuga and the B. abyssicola, the
Solmissus ceased its swimming and used between 3 and 5 tentacles to hold
the prey and direct the prey toward the lips and mouth. When the prey was
partially but securely surrounded by the lips,Solmissus released all of the
tentacles except one which remained holding the prey in place and resumed
swimming. Frequently, Solmissus would stop and position the released
tentacles resume one of the four feeding postures (see figure la, b, c, d.) Less
frequently, Solmissus would swim with 2-3 tentacled stretched out above the
bell. Finally, when Solmissus ingested the pneumatophore of N. biyuga, it
separated the pneumatophore from the rest of the body of N. biyuga once in
