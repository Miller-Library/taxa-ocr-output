Introduction: Although common in many parts of the world and throughout
the water column, medusae have rarely been studied compared to other
marine organisms. In fact, many of the fundamental aspects of their behavior
and interactions have not been explored because they are fragile, inaccessible,
and difficult to keep alive in a laboratory. Undamaged deep-sea medusae,
especially, have been inaccessible until recently with the technology of
submersibles and Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVS). As early as 1879,
Haeckel (1879), Agassiz (1902), Bigelow (1909), and Mayer (1910) described
midwater medusae from their trawl nets; however they could record no
behavioral information from the dead and damaged specimens. Researchers
have obtained very little information in regards to: What is the midwater
food web, and how do medusae fit into it?
Predator-prey relations represent the major interaction of marine
organisms. Subsequently, in accessible areas such as the intertidal, subtidal,
and surface ocean habitats, researchers have spent many years understanding
the complex food webs of the vertebrates and invertebrates. A growing body
of studies has explored basic feeding habits and interactions of shallow water
gelatenous creatures. (e.g. Madin, 1988; Purcell, 1983; Biggs 1977, Reeve et al.,
1978; Miller and Williams, 1973). However, very few researchers have
ventured into the midwater zone extensively enough to gather the same
amount of information on the feeding of deep-water gelatinous creatures.
Specifically, Larson, Mills, and Harbison (1989) have looked at the general
feeding and foraging of narcomedusae; Mills and Goy (1988) have recorded
migrations of the Solmissus albescens and some behavior, Purcell and Mills
(1988) have identified the correlation between types of hydrozoan
