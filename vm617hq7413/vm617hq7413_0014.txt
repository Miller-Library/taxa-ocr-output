The other gelatinous food which Solmissus did not ingest in the
kriesel was live Heurobrachia bachei. Although I had seen Feurobrachia in
the gut of Solmissus in video and preserved specimens, the Solmissus I had
in the tank at the time Pleurobrachia bachei was available was too unhealthy
to feed. Most of the tentacles of Solmissus had broken off and the remaining
two were not adequate to hold onto the prey while the mouth surrounded
the food. Each of the five times that the tentacles of Solmissus contacted P
bachei, Solmissus began the feeding behavior of puckering the lips and
extending the mouth towards the prey item. However, each time the P
bachei escaped by jerking its body away from Solmissus.
It has been assumed in the past that digestion takes place in the
stomach pouches, (Larson et al., 1989) but in cases of the digestion of the B.
abyssicola, there is more of a question of what is the specific function of the
stomach pouches as the prey's body decomposed mostly in the gut. For
instance, digestive enzymes may come from the stomach pouches into the
gut to digest the prey there, or the stomach pouches may be the mode by
which the animal absorbs the digested food. Their physiological function is
yet unclear.
The physiology of excretion in Solmissus is also unclear. No studies
have been done regarding how Solmissus discharges undigestible material
from its body. The observations about the pneumatophore and the comb
rows in the digestion of N. biyuga and B. abyssicola imply that one mode
may be pushing the excrement out the pinched mouth during digestion.
In addition to the efficient foraging behavior, during the ingestion and
digestion studies, Solmissus exhibited the five behaviors which reflect its
need to be an opportunistic predator in the midwater environment where
