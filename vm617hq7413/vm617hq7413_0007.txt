The tanks were checked during at least one period per day for 36 days.
My research was a total of 52 days, but the tanks were not checked on days
when (1) there were no Solmissus specimens, (2) the specimens had
unusable tentacles, or (3) the specimens had no gut. When I conducted the
feeding experiments, I checked the tanks at 20 minute intervals lasting from
1-20 minutes depending on the activity level of the animals. Each
observation period lasted from 1-36 hours depending on the activity of the
animals. In the experiments, I attempted to feed Solmissus brine shrimp,
Nanomia biyuga, Beroe abyssicola, a dead Paraphyllina ransoni? small pieces
(25 inches long) of Macrocystis blades, and Pleurobrachia bachei.
To identify the species of the Solmissus specimens, I used the standard
reference materials on medusae by Russell (1953), Bigelow (1909) and Mayor
(1910).
Results: From the ROV dives, I received a total of 13 Solmissus specimens
(see table 1,2.) All were caught using the RÃ–V detritus samplers, and the
physical condition of each was very good with the exception of three
specimens which were damaged prior to collection (dives on 4/13/92,
4/23/92, and 5/28/91.) The number of specimens collected at each dive site is
in table 1.
In the plankton kriesels, Solmissus tended to circulate on the bottom
right-hand side of the tank. However, the smaller animals would circulate
with the current around the whole tank and often scrape against the filter.
When circulating the whole tank, animals would often slide along the
bottom of the tank and pick up detritus in their tentacles. Two of the
