nematocysts and prey; and Larson (1979) has described the feeding of coronate
medusae.
Solmissus, a narcomedusa, has been observed from the surface in
upwelled waters to 975m in the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. Because
Solmissus is in such abundance in the water column, it is natural to assume
that they form an integral part of the mid-water food web. While there have
been some in situ observations of Solmissus with prey in its guts, in depth
information on the feeding habits and digestion of Solmissus does not exist.
Solmissus catches prey by firing nematocysts of the apotrichous
isorhizas type (Purcell and Mills, 1988) when the prey touches the animal's
tentacles. Ã–ften the prey struggles to free itself, but if Solmissus keeps hold of
the prey, its tentacles bend along a peronial groove toward the mouth (Larson
et al. 1989). The mouth, usually flat along the gut, begins to flare out toward
the tentacles in order to engulf the prey. When the lips contact the prey, cilia
lining the lips and mouth bring the prey into the mouth and in toward the
gut (Larson et al. 1989). Once the prey is inside the mouth, the lips pinch
closed, securing the prey inside the mouth and gut. Solmissus moves the
prey item towards the edge of the gut to the stomach pouches where the
digestion is hypothesized to take place.
The gut and mouth are made from a thin layer of tissue. One of the
difficulties of feeding studies, then, is that the fragile gut tends to void itself
when handled or exposed to rough current (Mills and Goy, 1988). The
tentacles also tend to break off with rough handling, a condition which
severely limits laboratory feeding experiments. With the advent of
submersibles and ROV's capable of capturing specimens without much
physical contact and the plankton kriesel tank which can recreate a deep-sea
current (Hamner, 1990), researchers can conduct experiments on the
