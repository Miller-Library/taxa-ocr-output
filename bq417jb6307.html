Introduction
Collembolids comprise an insect order whose members range widely
throughout the world, being found in almost every habitat where there
is moisture together with decaying vegetation (Bacon, 1941; Chang, 1966).
Because of their wide distribution, collembolids have been discussed
frequently in the literature. Due to economic factors, large populations
inhabiting agricultural soils have received the most attention; far less
has been written regarding species found in other habitats. Inter-
tidal species, for example, are only occasionally described in the lite¬
rature despite the fact that they also exhibit extremely high population
densities, with estimates of as many as 20,000/ m
(Davenport, 1903).
The meiofaunal component of intertidal collembolid populations has
rarely even been mentioned (Cox, 1976; Davenport, 1903), and there is
no work on temporal variation in their distribution in the sand. A dis-
crepancy in observed activity patterns of surface and meiofaunal elements
of a population of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Archisotoma besselsi : PartialExact'>Archisotoma besselsi found</span> on a pocket beach at
Mussel Point, California, prompted the experiments presented herein.
Twenty-four hour field studies conducted on this beach showed high
amounts of surface jumping activity concentrated at dawn regardless of
tidal conditions; in contrast, core samples taken periodically on the
same beach showed evidence of vertical migration related to tidal pheno-
mena. Observations through aquarium glass showed rates of migratory move-
ment approaching 3 cm/min. Field and laboratory studies revealed a
complex pattern of endogenous vertical migration activity having both
tidal and diel components. These results are of particular interest
when considered in conjunction with work done concurrently on the rhyth¬
mic jumping activity of the adjacent surface population by fellow workers
at Hopkins Marine Station (DeLapa, 1978; MoSpadden, 1978).
Investigations of temporal variations were complicated by exten¬
sive patchiness in spatial distribution of the population; field
studies showed the population to be concentrated along one cóntour
representing + tidal feet. In addition, both field and laboratory
experiments revealed significant heterogeneity between replicate
cores with regard to total numbers of animals present.
Materials and Methods
I used the coring apparatus described by Cox (1976); fourteen-inch
lengths of 3.5-cm diameter schedule-40 PVC pipe were bevelled on one
end and marked around their circumference 12" from the lower edge.
Treatment with silicon spray lubricant facilitated pushing out samples
for analysis; collembolids were never observed sticking to lubricated
cylinder walls. In the field, cores were pounded twelve inches into
the sand, plugged with a 7 solid rubber stopper, withdrawn, and sealed
on the bottom with another stopper to prevent loss of animals and water,
and to prevent reception of light cues by the organisms. A twelve-inch
depth was chosen and used uniformly throughout the experiments; my ob¬
servations showed the highest concentrations of specimens within this
column despite occurrence of collembolids to atleast 18" below the
surface.
All cores for a particular experiment were moved simultaneously into
a constant 18 C room. Here, the sealed cores were separated randomly
into batches of n cores and each batch placed upright in a separate
container. Originally, n was three but was changed later to 5 in an
attempt to minimize variability due to patchiness. At each sampling
period (corresponding closely with the external high tide, lowitide, and
an intermediate point for most studies), a container of n cores was re-
moved from the constant temperature room for immediate processing.
To process each core, the bottom stopper was removed and the base
of the core set into a sample jar. I would then remove the top stopper
and inspect the sand surface within the cylinder to observe any animals
active there. I would push out three-inch lengths of the sand column
into each of four sample jars, the lowest layer being pushed out first.
Jars were rapidly sealed to prevent loss of collembolids. The end of
the plunger was rinsed between each usage to prevent contamination from
one core to the next.
Animals were extracted from each jar by the following technique:
To each jar, I added approximately 30 mls of seawater and roughly 5-10 mls
of ethanol (95%) to kill the collembolids present. Each jar was swirled
gently to dislodge specimens and then decanted into a 150 ml beaker.
Washing with seawater alone was repeated twice more and the liquid de-
canted into the same beaker. Under a dissecting microscope, the inactive
and floating collembola were easily counted. I recorded the number of
animals extracted from each layer, then computed the percentage of the
core population in each 3" layer.
Field studies and collections for laboratory experiments were con¬
ducted on a pocket beach at Mussel Point in Monterey Bay. This beach
faces west and is composed of well-sorted granitic sand, fine to medium
in grain size. Use of graded Tyler sieves showed representative sand
samples to be characterized by the following regime of size classes:
#10-10%, #12-11%, #20-14, +35-26%, and 60 or smaller-9. In sev-
eral experiments requiring sand devoid of organic matter, commercial sand
of grades 20 and 35 was mixed in a ratio of 2:1 to approximate natural
conditions.
A preliminary survey of the distribution of organisms from lower
low water up to the permanent vegetation (at +11 feet above MLLW) revealed
two things. First, the meiofaunal population was highly localized
along a contour corresponding to +4 féet' tidal height. This area,:
later referred to as"station 18', consisted of points located 18 meters
seaward of the vegatation/beach interface. Underwater coring seåward
of the swash zone showed sustained high concentrations of animals in
the sand at station 18, despite a rising tide. This phenomenon is not
mentioned in the literature on intertidal collembolid species. Collec-
tion of cores for subsequent laboratory studies of endogenous behavior
were always made at this station.
The second major finding résulting from preliminary field studies
was that of marked differences in micro-scale distribution. Replicate
cores taken simultaneously at any one level of the beach invariably
showed a significant degree of heterogeneity (Rx C tests, Sokal and
Rohlf (1969); G values of 39.6 and 173.22 in two determinations, n-5
each time). Laboratory experiments showed this patchiness phenomenon
to persist even when animals were presented with a homogeneous environ-
ment of clean commercial sand kept under constant conditions. A five¬
gallon translucent white plastic container was painted black, then filled
with moist sand (8% by weight). A similar but unpainted container was
inverted and sealed to the first. Members of the experimental popula-
tion jumped off of a piece of filter paper which was introduced and later
removed; this method avoided bias due to localized addition of dead or-
ganisms. Diffuse dim lighting and constant temperatures were maintained
for twenty-four hours prior to sampling.
Studies of porosity explored this environmental factor as a possible
cause for patchy distribution of the field population; in order to ana-
lyze rates of water-flow through a column, sand from four sibling
samples was recombined, dried, and mixed thoroughly to simulate as
closely as possible porosity properties of the original core. Sand was
poured to a depth of 40 cm in lengths of 1.7 cm-diameter glass tubing to
which screen ad been affixed at the bottom. Columns prepared in this
manner were then suspended from a ring stand and wetted. Replicate
rates of flow were recorded for each column and the means of the results
compared by t-tests.
Effects of an altered diel cycle on endogenous vertical migration
were tested in one experiment conducted May 24-26. Cores receiving a
3-hour delayed day/night cycle were capped with inverted translucent
disposable 150-ml tri-lipped beakers. Two cans containing five cores
each were placed in a cardboard box and subjected to illumination of
300E during 14 hours of imposed daylight; the cores were left undis-
turbed for 49 hours prior to the first of two sampling periods.
In a similar experiment employing a 3-hour delayed tidal cycle,
"high" tide consisted of letting 11 C seawater stand within the PVC pipe
to a depth of one inch above the sand for approximately 64 hours.
"Low
tide conditions were imposed by draining the water out the bottoms of
the tubes through phytoplankton screening placed over a hole in the bot-
tom stopper. Water was reinstated 64 hours later (at the next "high"
tide) by affixing a pinch clamp to flexible tubing emerging from the
stopper hole.
Due to problems inherent in patchiness of the population under
study, statistical analyses were extremely important. In conjunction with
t-tests, linear regressions were used to adjust for a trend toward
smaller core populations with increasing time between time of collection
and processing; while this phenomenon suggested escape of collembolids
from cores kept in the laboratory, spot checks found no evidence of this.
With single classification analyses of variance (used with f-tests), I
used log transformations of percentages in order to normalize the data.
Cox (1976) has shoun this mothod to be acceptable in studies of another
intertidal collembolid <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anurida maritima : Exact'>Anurida maritima.</span> Significance of changes seen
c
in distribution within columns as a function of time or as a function
of variations between cores was checked using Rx C contingency tests
of the actual counts found.
Results & Discussion
All results indicate components of heterogeneity quite separate
from, and in addition to, temporal variations. Coring showed both
heavy concentrations of animals along a contour 18 meters from the perma¬
nent vegetation and high variability between replicate cores. In combi¬
nation with this, core populations showed variable distribution within
the sand column in apparent response to a complex endogenous rhyth.
While patchiness in collembolid populations has been mentioned (Butcher.
Snider, and Snider, 1971; Chang, 1966; Cox, 1976; Joose, 1966), the
extent and intricacy of this puzzling phenomenon has not been documented.
Observations of high concentrations of animals at station 18 were
frequently coupled with discovery of a dense one- to two-inch layer of
decaying vegetation in the 9"-12" stratum. Since decaying organic matter
is known to be a primary food source for many species of collembolids
(Bacon, 1941; Britt, 1951; Fenton, 1947), attraction to food seems
likely as a cause for patchiness of thesé organisms at Mussel Point.
Cccasionally in samples taken from station 18, up to forty or fifty per-
cent of the animals found in the deepest layer are less than two-thirds
the size of the remainder present. Of these smaller animals, some ex-
hibit the bluish black coloration of adults (Maynard, 1957) while the
smallest organisms display white coloration characteristic of juveniles
(Essig, 1958). Frequently, large concentrations of juveniles occur in
samples from the lowest layer which simultaneously show high amounts of
organic matter; this suggests that reproduction may occur in decaying
wrack buried here. Observations of another intertidal collembolid
Anurida maritima show that it carries out most of its reproductive cycle
in pockets of buried decaying vegetation (Joose, 1966). An explanation
for the apparent increase in numbers of smaller animals with depth may
be due to microhabitat structure changes inherent in greater depth;
specifically, diminishing pore space may limit the depths reached by
collembola of different sizes just as it does for the meiofuana in
general (Christiansen, 1964).
Laboratory experiments testing possible effects of substrait struc¬
ture on patchiness were revealing but did not show positive correlation
between the two. Studies of porosity versus number of animals extracted
showed no significant difference between cores which had shown very high
populations and those which had not. In experiments ranging in length
from one-half to three hours, animals inhabiting 3" layers of sand col-
lected in the field showed no migration into clean commercial sand placed
adjacent in the cylinders to the natural sand. Simultaneous field and
laboratory experiments (n-7 for each) showed that, like those in the
field, animals exposed for twenty-four hours to a homogeneous environ-
ment of commercial sand also exhibited significant patchiness (indices
of dispersion: X =73.8 and X =22.8 for lab and field studies, respec-
tively; p2.001 in both cases). The implication is strong that biolo-
gical interactions are in part responsible for the patchiness displayed
by both'the laboratory and field populations in this experiment.
Studies of microhabitat moisture differences supported previous
work showing differential distribution of collembolids in response to
this environmental parameter (Bacon, 1921; Butcher, Snider, and Snider,
1971; Christiansen, 1964; Ford, 1937; Joose, 1966). In a comparative
experiment, station 15 displayed uniforaly and significantly higher per-
centages of animals in the lowest layer than was found from station 18
(px.O1, t-test for percentage); animals higher on the beach might be
10
found deeper in the sand due to more favorable moisture conditions
nearer the water table (Hedgpeth, 1957). Another expariment employed
strong artificial lights 14.5 hours per day for two days prior to sam-
pling; dåtå from two sampling periods 34 hours apart (n-5 each time)
revealed over sixty percent of the animals to be located in the lower
two layers at each sampling. The sand in these cores had dried out
(probably due to a slight elevation in temperatures caused whenever'the
artificial lights were activated); an apparent downward migration in
response to dessication and elevated temperatures was indicated.
Findings of extreme patchiness in the beach population meant that
patterns of temporal variation are superimposed on and perhaps often
obscured by the variability in macro- and micro-distribution. Standar-
dizing temporal parameters inherent in the sampling process was critical
for observation and characterization of endogenous temporal variation.
Cores which were processed immediately after removal from the substratum
gave percentage values which did not differ significantly from those ob-
tained when samples were sealed and placed under constant laboratory
conditions for thirty minutes prior to processing; see Table I for data.
An experimental sampling frequency of approximately 34 hours was used
for most of my experiments; sampling more frequently did not greatly
increase resolution of trends in periodic behavior. Figure 1B shows the
results of such a study. The lines shown are drawn through data corre-
sponding to those collected on May 4 & 5 (Figure 14). The curves, when
drawn through data points separated by the same 34-hour interval, show
striking similarities; the other points, while adding scatter, nonethe-
less support the illustrated trends in endogenous vertical migration
activity. Note that the tidal cycle occurs at the same time of night
11
in each case. For May 4th and 5th, elevation of values for percentage
in the bottom layer together with reduced values in the top layer is
probably weather-related; high surf conditions prevailed when samples
were collected for the May 4 study whereas conditions were much calmer
prior to the May 20 experiment.
Complete results of the May 4 & 5 study are shown in Figure 2.
The trends seen suggested a predictive model of temporal movement in the
meiofaunal collembolid population: an increase in the percentage of
animals in the top layer is seen at low tides while a decrease is ob-
served for high tide; a similar but inverse relationship to tides is
seen for the lowest layer. In this graph, the middle layers show an
inverse relationship to each other, and the movements in these layers
do not correspond well to known exogenous cycles. In all studies, mi¬
gration activity shown by these middle layers displayed much higher var-
iability than that shown by either the top (0-3") or the bottom (9-12")
layers. Therefore, in subsequent figures only data from the top and
bottom strata are illustrated and discussed.
Despite the fact that data from most 24-hour experiments appeared
by inspection to fit the proposed hypothesis of migration patterns :
correlated to tidal phenomena, statistical tests sometimes cast doubts.
For example, performing a linear regression followed by pair-wise
t-tests on data collected May 4 & 5 shows differences between mean high
tide and low tide values within each layer to be statistically insigni-
ficant. Similarly, when data from this study is combined with that from
four others conducted between May 9 and May 25, log-transformed means
compared by t-test again fail to show significance between all the high
and low tide values obtained; this is probably due to higher variability
shown in patterns of migration during daylight hours.
﻿12
When percentages from the bottom layer in each of five studies
are analyzed with respect to high tides occurring during the night (See
Figure 13), statistical significance is readily demonstrated. Here,
pair-wise t-tests of log-transformed means show expectations of random
occurrence of p £.02 (f-16) between valuas for the preceding low tide
versus the nocturnal high tide; similarly, expectations of random occur-
rence show p 2.03 (f-18) for the high versus the subsequent low tide,
whether that low occurs in darkness or during the first hours of daylight.
while statistical analyses verify the probability of a tidal component
in endogenous patterns of migration, elements of a diel component may
also be present. The similarity in shape of Figure 3-F to Figures
3 .-A,B,C,D,& E suggests a rise in percentage of animals occupying the
lowest layer after the onset of darkness, independent of high tides.
Additionally, all cases except 3 -D and 3 -E exhibit a decline in
values of the lowest layer shortly before dawn. The 5/24 and 5/25
studies (Figures :3'-D & 3 -E) were part of a 53-hour investigation in
which I was sampling only every six hours. Hence, I was not sampling at
a frequency which would have revealed low pre-dawn values had they
occurred. Thus, Figure 3 shows that darkness appears to have a pre-
dictable and additive effect on the tidal component of an endogenous
vertical migration pattern.
Laboratory studies undertaken to separate these components consisted
of imposing three-hour delayed light and tidal cycles to separate batches
of cores maintained independently under constant temperature conditions.
Two batches of five cores weré subjected to altered tidal conditions for
494 hours before sampling; results showed that this regimen was insuffi-
cient to produce migration behavior different from that expected in an
13.
undisturbed field population. Cbservations of ten cores subjected to
altered light/dark conditions for 493 hours prior to sampling proved in-
conclusive; unlike normal samples, these cores showed no apparent change
in the percentage of animals found per layer from the first to the
second (and last) readings. Core dessication may have caused death.
Figure 4 presents results of a 24-hour study conducted May 16 & 17
which yielded statistically significant but anomalous behavior in the
surface layer. Single-classification analyses of variance (Sokal and
Rohlf, 1969) reveal that there is a significant change in the means ob-
served for the top layer through time (pX.05). Inspection of the
graph affirms this; not only are peaks in activity of the top layer
seen at low tides, but similarly dramatic peaks appear at high tides.
Note that peaks seen at low tides are significantly higher than peaks
at high tide; pair-wise t-tests for percentage showed the difference be-
tween the means of the high tide and low tide peaks to be expected as
random with p .01. This study shows rhythmic migration behavior
which is exceptionally well correlated with tidal phenomena; however,
peaks in surface layer activity at high tide contradict trends expected
by the predictive model. The réasons for this anomalous bimodal pattern
are unknown. Such a phenomenon was not seen in any other experiment;
a study conducted three days later (on May 20) showed a return to
previously seen activity patterns (See Figure 14).
Figure 5 shows the results of an experiment conducted May 16, when
high tide corresponded almost exactly with dawn. Note that this study
was actually conducted the day before that shown in Fizure 4; as in
the latter, surface activity increases rather than decreases for condi-
tions of high tide. Anomalous trends in activity of the top layer in
these temporally contiguous experiments might suggest that simultaneous
occurrence of high tide and dawn temporarily destabilizes expected
rhythms of endogenous activity. Interestingly, MeSpadden (1978)
observed that when high tide and dawn corresponded during a series of
free-run experiments on the periodicity of jumping activity in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. besselsi,</span>
a radical phase shift was associated with the day on which "crossover"
of the diel and tidal cycles occurred.

Summary
In a meiofaunal population of the intertidal collembolid
Archisotoma besselsi found on a pocket beach at Mussel Point.
California:
(a) An endogenous rhyth of vertical migration was de-
monstrated and a predictive model of location in the sand-
versus tidal condition was developed.
(b) Tidal patterns with diel influences were implicated
as major components of this endogenous rhyth.
(c) Gross patchiness was exhibited by the population and
was attributed in part to characteristics of the sand
column.
(d) The majority of the population was localized at
approximately + feet above MLLW and was found to remain
at varying depths within the sand even when completely
inundated by the tides.
(e) Exposure to approximately forty-nine hours of a
3-hour delayed tidal regime was insufficient to change
expected trends in the migration pattern.
(f) Suggestion was made that simultaneous occurrence of
dawn and high tide temporarily destabilizes expected activity
rhythms.
