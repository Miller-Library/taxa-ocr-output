lines, indicating cracks just beneath the surfece. Eventuslig
these cracks would emerge at the inner surface of the shell
along the scar, often merging and traveling down to fracture
the margin. Fatigue loading thus concentrated the stresses
along the scar, ultimatelg producing surface cracks that would
join and sever the top of the shell at the muscle scar.
SCAMMING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE OBSERVATIONS
A possible explenation to the mechanism by which shells
loaded at the margin frectured first at the muscle scar lies in
the muscle scer microstructure. Anagises of the frectured
crossed-lamellar structure at the muscle scar reveal that the
lamellee are oriented with the surface of each sheet lying
normal to the shell's outer surface. In this manner a crack mag
travel along the scer (between the primarg lamellae), leaving
behind a smooth fracture surface. This situation is analogous
to splitting plywood along the grain(Curreg, 1974,1980), in the
direction requiring the leest energg. Although a crock cen
spread between crossed-lamellar sheets for a short distance,
