The majority of shells frectured elong the length or
width of the muscle scer broke cleanlg, completelg severing
the top of the shell from the shell's rim (figure 21). The
effectiveness of this form of attack indicates that a crab such
as Pechugrepsus crassipes cen preg upon limpets without
having to remove the shell from the rock substrate. In mang
cases, particulerly those involving Calliselle limetule, forces
applied at the level of the muscle scar caused portions of the
shell margin just below the point of contact between the
simulated claw and the shell to shatter into framents. For an
actual crab attacking a limpet such as C limatule, this
fragmentation of the shell's margin might enable the crab to
reach under the shell directlg and grab the limpet's exposed
foot. Crushing attacks by crabs at the muscle scar might also
be useful for two other reasons. First, observed mang
instences where limpet shells were curved at the base to
match the substrate, making an attack at the margin more
difficult since the ends were at different heights (see also
