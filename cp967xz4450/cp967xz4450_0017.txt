creck surface resulting from cleavage of the crossed-lameller
structure between the primarg lamellae (along the grain). As
seen in figure 17, the parallel crossed-lamellar sheets ran
along the shell at the level of the muscle scar with each sheet
parallel normal to the outer surface of the shell (figure 170).
Figure 178 illustrates the smooth fracture surface along the
side of the scar, showing that the crack passed between
lamellae.
F. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS STRESS DIAGRAMS
The stress diagrems for C. oigitalis in figure 19 show
the relative compressive (colored plates) and tensile (white
plates with numbers) stresses resulting from forces applied at
each grasping orientation. The shells with forces applied along
the length and width of the scar show tensile stresses
concentrated where the force was applied, with low
compressive stresses elsewhere. In contrast, the shells with
forces applied at the margin length and width show high tensile
stresses ot the point of opplication 9s well os high
