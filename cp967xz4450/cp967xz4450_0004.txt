left the rim of the shell intact, the top was cleanly severed
from the rest of the shell. Tests done with needle-nosed pliers
showed that for Colliselle limatule substantially less force
was required to fracture the shell at the scar than at other
points. In this studg l examine the apparent structural
weckness of the muscle scar lager both by comparing the
forces required to break shells of one species et different
locations and by compering the forces necessarg to crush shells
of different species at the same point on the shell. To see if
high and low-spired limpets differed in fracture strength
focused on species that varied in relative height (figure 1).
Another reason for focusing in particular on the muscle scar
lager was that most limpet shells varg in thickness along the
shell (figure 24), with a thickened margin and apez and a
relatively thin muscle scar lager. One objective of my studg
wes to determine if this thinning-out of the shell neer the scer
allowed the shell to fracture more easilg at the scar,
especially in comparison to the thickened margin.
