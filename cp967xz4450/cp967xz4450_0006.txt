outer surface. The high tensile strength of the prisms would
allow this material to resist frecture at higher stresses than
the lower strength of the adjacent shell structures. In light of
this picture, 1 was interested in investigating which structural
festures of the muscle scar lager, if ang, account for the
fracture mechanics.
Another interesting aspect of limpet shell fracture at
the muscle scer involves fatigue fracture. Boulding (1966) and
Currey (1984) have examined fatigue fracture in bivalves and
shovn that crabs often load a shell repeatedig up to around 200
times (sometimes over several hours or dags). As long as the
crab exerts a force/area of at least 60-702 of the predicted
breaking strength, the shell is likely to fracture after a number
of cycles at this submaximal stress. In this fashion crabs can
successfully attack large shells that theg cannot crush in one
attempt. As no study thus far has examined fatigue fracture in
intertidel limpets, also investigated the effectiveness of the
this predatorg technique.
