the crossed-lameller sheets that the actuel muscle scar
cleavage occurs.
FINITE ELENENT AMALYSIS GRAPHS
Comperison of the relative stresses ceused by forces
applied along the length and width of the scar and margin for
the Colliselle digitelis(figure 19) computer model reveal that
forces transmitted along the length and width of the margin
produced high compressive stresses at the level of the scar
around the front half of the shell. Although the forces applied
along the length and width of the scar produce (as expected)
higher tensile stresses at the point of application, the shells
with equivalent forces applied at the length and width of the
margin show high compressive stress at the muscle scar.
While the shell will tend to fracture at a lower stress in
tension than compression, a high compressive stress mag still
lead to fracture, especially at the scar where the shell
thickness is much smaller then at the margin. Forces applied
at the margin cause both high tensile stress at the margin and
