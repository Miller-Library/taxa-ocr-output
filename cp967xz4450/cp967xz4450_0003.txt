fractured et the muscle scar because these smaller scar-width
shells are within the grasping range of more crabs. Fatigue
fracture proved significant (causing fracture below 200 cycles)
at force loads above 602 of the predicted breaking force. Above
70-752 of predicted strengths, fracture required less than 50
cycles, indicating that within short time spans crabs could
fracture shells without ever exerting a maximum force.
Scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the
crossed-lamellar lagers along the horseshoe-shaped scar lager
form almost continuous sheets that allow cracks to frecture
the upper portion of the shell cleanly at the muscle scer.

A previous studg on intertidal limpets (Chapin, 1966)
focused on the predatorg of the shore creb, Fachygrepsus
crassiges. Several limpets, particularly Colliselle limatule,
left in an aquarium with a crab were found after several dags
to have been crushed neer the muscle scar. This form of attack
