C
loaded in the apparatus the apex of the limpet shell pointed
toward the blocks. The base of the shell rested on an adjacent
block of wood (see figure 6) that served as a substrate to
prevent slippage. The force was applied by attaching a spring
scale to the hook protruding from the end of the upper block.
The force was incressed slowlg until the shell fractured, and
this maximum force was recorded. The magnitude of the actual
force transmitted to the shell was calculated by accounting for
the mass of the wood blocks and the spring scale. By adjusting
the orientation and point of contect between shell and crushing
device, one could load shells from each species at one of four
locations (figure 7):
1) Force applied along the length of the margin, here termed
Longitudinal Margin.
2) Force applied along the width of the margin, here termed
Lateral Margin.
3) Force applied along the length of the muscle scar, h√®re
termed Longitudinal Scar.
