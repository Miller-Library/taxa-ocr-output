sequence examined the shell under a dissecting microscope
after every 25-30 cycles to trace the development of
fatigue/stress cracks. A scanning electron microscope was
used to examine fatigue cracks and fracture surfaces along the
muscle scar lager.
C. FIMITE ELEMENT ANALVSIS
constructed models of four limpet species (Calliselle
pelte, Colliselle limatule, Colliselle digitalis, Acmees mitre)
on a Macintosh"" computer using e finite element analgsis
progrem (HSC/pal"â€œ, MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation). The
models consisted of interconnected quadrilateral and triangular
plates. The nodal points (XYZ coordinates) for each limpet were
determined by first projecting a slide with a grating (see
figure 8) onto the shell. The pattern of lines on the shell was
then photographed and the resulting picture projected onto a
screen. The result was a topographic map of the shell surface,
from which ! derived XY coordinetes (2 coordinates were
measured on the shell). Also, specified realistic material
