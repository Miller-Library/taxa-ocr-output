necessary to fracture thicker shells.
C. COMPARISONS OF SHELL DIMENSIONS WITHIN AND AMONG
SPECIES
Measurements at the length and width of the scar and
margin revealed (figure 12) that for each species the shell
width at the scar was significantlg smaller than the distence
which must be spanned by a cheliped in the other three
orientations (pÂ«.001 in all three cases). Also, the comparison
of sizes emong species (figure 13), using shells with similar
lengths (margin length- 18-2 1mm) revealed that C. limatule
has the smallest average width at the scar(pe.00 1), with 4
mitre substantially wider at the scar than the others.
D. FATIGUE-LOADING EXPERIMENTS
The results of repeated force loading along the length of
the scar for C limatule and C. pelte show the effectiveness of
this type of force loading (Figure 14). As long as the static
force exceeded 603 of the predicted breeking force the
strength of the shell was reduced. The values for predicted
