the margin than along the length of the scar by a fector of 1.8.
Still, it appears that a crab has no general advantage in
crushing a shell at ang one location on the shell. Thus despite
the apparent thinning of the shell at the muscle scar region,
some other factor is necessarg to make attacks at the scar
vulnerable to crabs.
In considering the dimensions of a limpet shell at both
the muscle scer and the margin, it is cleer that the grasping
orientation where a crab would have to open a cheliped least is
at the width of the scer. The width of the scar was found to be
significantlg less than the other three shell dimensions for
each of the four species, suggesting that even relativelg small
crabs could still crush large limpets by gresping them at the
Width of the scar. For example, a crab that could open a
cheliped to a maximum of 7.1 mm at the tip would still be able
grasp a 20mm long Calliselle limatule shell along the width of
the scar. Moreover, a crab with a 20mm maximum opening that
would just barelg fit the cheliped along the margin length could
