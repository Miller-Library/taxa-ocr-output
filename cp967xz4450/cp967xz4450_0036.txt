rim remains). Data for forces applied to each tupe of shell longitudinallg

Figure 12. Graphs showing sheil length and width at the scar and margin
for A. C digitalis, B. C limatula, C. A. mitra, and D. C. pelta. In each
instance the width at the scer is significentlg smaller than the other
three orientations(p«.00 1 for all four graphs).
Figure 13. Comparison of shell length(A) and shell width(B) at the level of
the scar among the four species. Shells from each species were
approximatelg equal in length( 18-2 1mm). Both graphs indicate that #
limatule hes the smallest dimensions at the scar(among similar length
shells), with the difference being greatest at the width of the scar.
Figure 14. Fatigue loading in C limatule(A) and C. gelte(B), Shells were
odded for 5 seconds for up to a maximum of 200 cycles. When the applied
force was greater than 603 of the predicted breaking force(see figure 104
&D), fracture resulted in fewer than 200 cycles. Around 752 fewer than
50 cgcles could result in fracture.
Figure 15. Cracking patterns from fatigue-loading(longitudinallu along the
scar) in limpet shells. A. Fatigue crecks originating near the front end of
the shell, at the level of the muscle scar. B. Typical spreading of cracks
along the muscle scar. C. Later stage, showing radial cracks near the
apex. D. Stage just prior to fracture, showing crecks merging and moving
rädially toward the margin. Crecks are shown on the underside of the
shells.
Figure 15. Scanning electron micrograph of fatigue cracks. Several cracks
are shown running along the muscle scar lager(the outline of the
mgostracum is visible near the top left of the picture). Magnification
