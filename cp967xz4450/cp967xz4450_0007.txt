MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. TEST OF MUSCLE SCAR AND SHELL MARGIN STRENGTH
Callisella pelts, Colliselle limstule, Colliselle sigitslis,
and Acmses mitre (figure 5) were collected at various
locations at the Hopkins Marine Station (Pacific Grove, CA) and
placed in an aquerium with running sea water. The limpets
were dissected out of the shell and the shells placed in dishes
with sea water. Messurements were taken of: length and width
of the shell at both the scar and the margin; height from
aperture to apex; and the thickness of the shell at the front,
back, right side, and left side at the level of both scar and
margin. To fracture the shells constructed two
nutcrecker-like devices (figure 6). Each crushing device
consisted of two blocks of wood connected by a hinge, such that
the blocks could close like upper and lower jaws. Two small
metal plates (see figure 6) on the same side of each block acted
as teeth to contact the shell and transmit the force. When
