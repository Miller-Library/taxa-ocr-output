C
the width of the scar
6) The width of C limstule shells at the scar was significantig
less than the other species, suggesting that more crabs are
eble to crush this species' shells at the scer since more crabs
cen actually grasp these shells et the scar width.
7) Above 602 of the predicted breaking force fatigue loading
fractured shells of C pelte and C. limatule in under 200 cycles.
Above 70-752 less than 50 cycles were necessarg, suggesting
that crabs can crush limpet shells without ever exerting 1002
of the force required to break an unfatigued shell. Also,
smaller crabs incapable of exerting 100% breaking force loads
for large shells can still crush the limpet shell
8) Fatigue cracks originate at the front of the shell and usuallt
travel along the muscle scar, eventuallg severing the top of the
shell.
9) SEH observations revealed crossed-lameller sheets at the
muscle scar oriented such that cracks mag travel between the
sheetstenergetically favorable direction) and eventuallg cause
