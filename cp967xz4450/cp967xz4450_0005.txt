The horseshoe-sheped muscle scer (figure 28) on the
inner surfece of limpet shells results from the attachment of
the foot adductor muscles. Although Chapin (1966) found C.
limatule shells to break more easilg along the length than
width of the scar, was interested to discover if some feature
of the actual shell structure along the horeshoe-shaped scar
accounted for the frecture characteristics. In particuler,
HacClintock (1967) describes the myostracal (muscle scer
lager of the shell as differing from the typical
crossed-lamellar structure of limpet shells (figure 34). At the
scer the muscle attechment interferes with the usuel
shell-laging process of the mantle. The resulting structure is
usuallg prismatic, and Curreg (1974) describes this structure
as stronger than crossed-lamellar (tensile strength Â»60PN/m-
for prisms). The prisms of the myostracum form the inner
surface of the shell (figure 3B). Figure 4 shows the effects of
a crushing force applied by a crab cheliped, with the result
being tension along the inner surece and compression along the
