compressive stresses at the level of the scar (see color
scheme, figure 18). Also of note is that forces applied at the
lateral scar and margin produced greater tensile and
compressive stresses at the front of the shell and at the scar
(compared to forces applied longitudinallg along the scar and
margin).
also compered stresses between e high profile (4.
mitra) end low profile (C. limatula) limpet shell of equel
length and found that at each grasping orientation C limatule
reached greater stress concentrations then A mitra For
instance, application of 802 of the predicted breaking force to
C limatule along the length of the scar resulted in a stress
equal to 7-103 of gielding strength at the scar and margin,
while a comparable load for A. mitre (803 predicted bresking
force) produced a stress equal to only 1-32 of gielding strength
(figure 20).
