structure at the muscle scer. Surface shown is the beginning of the
muostrecum, viewed(et e slight angle) from the front and towerd the reer
of the shell. The cross-lamellar sheets originate just below the upper
(ectuelly lower on the shell) lager of prisms. B. SEM photogreph of the
fracture surface along the scar. The surface is smooth since the crack
treveled between the lamellee. C. Diegrem showing orientation of
crossed-lameller sheets at the muscle scer. The primarg lamellee run
normel to the external shell surfece, such that a crab-like force can ceuse
crecks between the sheets. Once between the lemellee the creck cen
spreed eround the shell.

maximum gield strength. Tensile stresses appear on the graph as white
plates with values included in the legend.
Figure 19. Stress diagrams for C digitalis compering forces applied at
the margin and scer. Forces applied et the margin produced high
compressive stresses along the scar, possibly explaining whg in these
cases the shell fractured first along the scar. A. "Front scarâ€œ refers to a
force applied longitudinallg along the scar. B. "Front margin" refers to a
force epplied longitudinallg along the mergin. In C & D "Lateral" refers to
a force applied laterallg along the scar(C) and margin(D). Tensile
stresses(Z of gielding strength): A. 1=3.6, 2=3.3, 3=3.1, 4=3.3, 5=3.1 B.

end 4 mitre computer models. For forces applied longitudinalig along the
scar(A B) and the margin(C,D) C Jimatula shows much greater
compressive stress along both the scar and mergin. This most likeig
occurs because C limetule is much thinner than A. mitre all along the
shell. Tensile stresses(Z of gielding strength): A. 1-1.7 B. 1=2.5, 2=2.3
