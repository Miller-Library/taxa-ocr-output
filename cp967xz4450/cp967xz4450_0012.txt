C
respectivelg). A. mitre did not show a significant force vs.
thickness relationship. Comparisons of mean force/thickness
values between pairs of the three species showing significant
positive force/thickness slopes (for longitudinal/scer loading)
revealed that C oigitalis shells were easier to crush than
those of C. limstule, but only by a factor of 1.3. A similar set
of force vs. scer thickness calculations for loading ecross the
width of the scar and length/width of the margin produced
compareble trends, with only 4. mitra displaging no significant
increase in force required for frecture es thickness at the scar
increased. For the comparison of forces required to fracture
the shell when loaded longitudinallg and laterallg at the
margin, plotted force against relative thickness (scar
thickness/margin thickness), since the force required to
frecture the shell at the margin depends on the margin
thickness as well as the thickness at the scar. In all three
cases (lateral scer, longitudinal/lateral margin) no significant
differences appeared among the species tested.
