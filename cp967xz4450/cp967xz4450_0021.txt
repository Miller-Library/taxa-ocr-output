exception being that Calliselle digitelis shells were about 1.3
times easier to fracture at the length of the scar than
Collisella limatule shells. This outcome indicates that the
force required to fracture shells of most limpet species
depends more on the material properties of the calcium
carbonate shell than on the particular shell shape. Thus in
general tall, high-spired Acmaes mitre and low, flat Calliselle
limetule shells of similar muscle scar thicknesses will
fracture at similar crushing forces.
Within each species, shells of similer scar thicknesses
fractured along both the length and width of the muscle scar
and margin did not break at significentlg different force
ranges. Taking into account that the thickness of the shell
margin might influence the force at which margin-loaded sheil
broke by comparing force to relative thickness(scar
thickness/margin thickness) similerlg produced no significant
differences. Again the only exceptions appeared in Colliselle
limatule, where the shell broke more easily along the length of
