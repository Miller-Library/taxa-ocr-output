C
the shell, scar-level rings would merge and travel radiallg
toward the margin (figure 150). In this manner when the shell
ultimately fractured the top would "pop-off" and the margin
rim left behind would split in two.
E. OBSERVATIONS OF FRACTURE PATTERNS AT THE MUSCLE SCAR
1. Visual-- In longitudinal scar loading most shells
would develop a small crack at the very front of the shell at
the level of the scer under sub-breaking loads (seen
perticulerly in C. limatule during fetigue-loading). Once the
force epplied reached the critical level, the entire top would
break off cleanly at the scar. In mang cases the fracture at the
front of the shell anterior to the actual myostracum was
jagged and irregular, while the fracture at the scar itself was
smooth. Margin-loaded shells tend to break first at the scar
level. In mang instances the entire top would fracture cleanig
before the margin shattered.
2. SEM-- Closer inspections of scer fracture surfaces
under the scanning electron microscope revealed a smooth
