Morris, Abbott, and Haderlie, 1980). Despite the curve of the
margin, the rest of the shell was not changed, such that a crab
could still gresp the shell at the level of the scar. Second,
also found mang limpets with shell margins either embedded in
the rock or wedged against rocks, algae, or even barnacles. In
each of the cases a crab might experience difficulty in crushing
or prying at the margins, but in all likelihood the crab could
still squeeze a shell higher up et the scar level.
FORCE TO BREAK VERSUS SHELL THICKNESS AT THE PUSCLE
SCAR
With the exception of Acmaee mitre shells, found that
the force required to fracture limpet shells at the muscle scar
increased as the thickness at the scar increased. However,
did not discover significant differences in force/thickness
means among the three species showing significant trends in
force vs. thickness (C limatule, C. pelte, C. digitelis) This
result wes true for forces epplied at both the length and width
of the shell at the muscle scer and mergin, with the only
