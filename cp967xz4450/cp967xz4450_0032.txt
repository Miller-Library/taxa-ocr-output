the 'pop-top' effect at the muscle scar.
10) Finite element analysis computer models indicate that
forces applied along the length and width of the margin produce
high compressive stresses et the much thinner muscle scer,
often ceusing frecture at the scer first. Also, the relativelg
flat C limatule shells showed higher overall tensile and
compressive stresses than the tall A. mitre shells, probebly
due to the thinner scar lager in equal-length C limatule and 4.
mitre shells.
