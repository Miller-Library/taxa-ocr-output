If calcium is a necessary cofactor for phospholipase activity, why was there
appreciable activity in the reaction to which no CaClz was added? This activity could be
due to calcium present in the seawater in which the venom was dissolved. Seawater
contains approximately 10 mM Ca“. In a 1-ml reaction with 10 ul venom in seawater,
this would be diluted to about 0.1 mM Ca“. This is conceivably enough calcium to
permit the moderate phospholipase activity that was observed. Mclntosh et al. (1995
report no decrease in Conus magus phospholipase activity in CaClz concentrations down
to O.1 mM. Although this low concentration apparently supports phospholipase activity
in Conus californicus, the activity approximately doubles in 10 mM CaCh, suggesting
that more that 0.1 mM CaCl may be necessary for full stimulation, although 10 mM is
probably excessive.
Mclntosh et al. (1995) report a specific activity for cleavage of an sn-2 thiolester
phospholipid analog by conodipine-M, the phospholipase in C. magus, of 22 mmol per
min per mg phospholipase at a concentration of I mg enzyme per ml. It is difficult to
compare this to the maximal C. californicus activity of 1.724 x 1033 mol per min per ul
because the concentration of phospholipase in the venom supernatant is not yet known.
This information would be useful in determining the relative importance of
phospholipases in the survival of these two cone snails.
Future experiments should be run using different phospholipase assays. The
colorimetric assay of Kasurien and Vanha-Perttula (1987) should be considered to
investigate calcium-dependence, and certain fluorometric assays may be appropriate as
well. The colorimetric assay used in these experiments is not specific for phospholipases
Az because they are not the only species that catalyze the release of fatty acids.
