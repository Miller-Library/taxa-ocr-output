Phospholipase assay
Phospholipase activity was assayed by the colorimetric assay of de Araujo and
Radvanyi (1987). The reaction medium contained 3.5 mM L-a-phosphatydyl choline
(Avanti Polar-Lipids), 7 mM Triton X-100 detergent (Sigma), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
CaCh, and 0.055 mM phenol red (Sigma). pH was adjusted to 7.6 using HCl and NaÖH.
A reaction volume of 1 ml was used. Assays were done at 25’C and lasted 5-10 min
each.
Detection of phospholipase activity is based on enzymatic release of free fatty acids,
which causes an absorbance decrease in the pH indicator phenol red. A wavelength of
558 nm was used for spectrophotometry, which corresponds to an optical density of 1.8 at
a pH equal to phenol red’s pK, which is 7.6. Optical density measurements were made
on a BioSpec-1601 from Shimadzu.
RESULT
Hemolysis assay
Several concentrations of venom were applied to red blood cells to observe its
hemolytic effect. Venom dilutions of 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, 1:10000, and no venom were
assayed. The relative numbers of cells intact after treatment with each of these dilutions
in frog Ringer solution are given in Fig. 1. The effect of the venom on the cells after 5
min venom treatment appeared to be complete hemolysis. Cells apparently completely
disintegrated by the time the assay could be made, and no remants or debris were visible
in the field of view of the microscope.
