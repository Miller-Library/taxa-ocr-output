phospholipids, releasing nonesterified fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Ali et al. 1999)
Phospholipase Az is a critical component of the cytolytic action of venoms from snakes,
bees, and sea anemones, likely facilitating the neurological effects of other venom
constituents (Grotendorst and Hessinger 1999). The presence of a phospholipase Az in a
species of cone snail (Mclntosh et al. 1995) suggests that they might employ a similar
strategy
Duct venom from C. californicus was observed to have a cytolytic effect on
several cell types, including HEK 293 cells, mouse neuroblastoma cells, and goldfish red
blood cells (unpublished data). The cytolytic effect on red blood cells of certain venom
phospholipases (Grotendorst and Hessinger 1999) suggests that a phospholipase could be
responsible for these effect. Because of their detrimental effects to cellular proteins,
proteases could also be responsible. To identify the biochemical basis of the observed
cytolytic activity of C. californicus duct venom, a proteolysis activity assay and a
phosholipase activity assay were employed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Venom preparation
Conus californicus snails were collected subtidally in Monterey Bay, California.
Five (5) snails were dissected, and their venom ducts, along with the venom bulbs, were
removed. Venom was extracted by squeezing the entire lengths of the 5 ducts, and the
resulting venom was dissolved in 0.5 ml of seawater. The crude whole duct venom was
centrifuged for 10 min to pellet the non-soluble fraction. The supernatant fraction was
