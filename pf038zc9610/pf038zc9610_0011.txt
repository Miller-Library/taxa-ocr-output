Specificities of the various phospholipases in reactions with phospholipids are shown in
Fig. 6. More specific phospholipase assays should be employed to determine the
enzymeâ€™s specificity.
Subsequent work on this enzyme could focus on its separation from other proteins
in the venom supernatant and on its purification. This would facilitate further
characterization of activity, pH dependence, sequencing of the enzyme, and so forth.
Additional studies directed at elucidating the biological relevance of the enzyme to
venom production or activity would also be fruitful.
