phosphatytdyl choline solution and the associated pH and absorbance changes. This
enzyme is presumably a phospholipase.
A phospholipase could serve various purposes in C. californicus. Digestive
phospholipases are present in high concentrations in nature in intestinal fluids, bacterial
secretions, and venoms (Stryer 1995). Its presence in the venom duct, however, suggests
that it may be a component of the injected venom. Cytolytic activity of phospholipases in
venoms is important to several venomous animals (Grotendorst and Hessinger 1999), and
it may serve such a role in C. californicus. Cytolytic activity could increase exposure of
prey tissue to neurotoxic conopeptides present in the venom. Phospholipase activity
could be involved in the secretion of peptides into the venom duct or in some other part
of peptide production or processing. Phospholipases Az have also been noted to have
several myotoxic and neurotoxic effects (Ho and Ko 1988). Another major function of
phospholipases is cellular signaling.
Phopspholipases generate highly active signal
molecules and their precursors (Stryer 1995). More investigations are necessary to
determine what purpose phospholipase activity might serve in the venom.
The apparent calcium-dependence of phospholipase activity in Conus californicus
is not surprising. Most phospholipases A2 require mM concentrations of calcium for
activation (Kasurinen and Vanha-Perttula 1987; Mclntosh et al. 1995; Ali et al. 1999
Costa and Palma 2000). Calcium serves as a cofactor for these molecules, binding near
the active site. Future work should examine phospholipase activity in the presence of a
chelating agent such as EGTA or EDTA to bind and remove calcium from solution, such
as described by Kasurinen and Vanha-Perttula (1987).
