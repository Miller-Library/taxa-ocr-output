Fig. 5. Decrease in phospholipase activity subsequent to heating at 65°C or 75°C for 5
min as compared to an unheated sample. The same assay was used as that used in
conjunction with Fig. 3.
Fig. 6. Specificity of phospholipases on a generic phospholipid molecule. For
phosphatydyl choline, Rz =-CHz-CH2-N(CH3);. Hydrolysis by either
phospholipase Aj or phospholipase Az causes the release of free fatty acid.
