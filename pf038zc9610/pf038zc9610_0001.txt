ABSTRACT
Phospholipase activity is known to be present in the venoms of many venomous
animals, including snakes, bees, spiders, sea anemones, and one Conus species. Whole
duct venom was extracted from several specimens of Conus californicus, dissolved in
seawater, and centrifuged. The supernatant fraction was observed to possess robust
cytolytic activity. The biochemical basis of this activity was explored using two
enzymatic assays. First, proteolytic activity of the venom supernatant towards casein, a
universal protease substrate, was assayed spectrophotometrically. Following incubation
with the venom supernatant, unreacted casein was precipitated and activity assayed by
measuring any increase in absorbance of the reaction mixture as a result of digested
casein in solution. The venom showed no detectable caseinase activity. Second,
phospholipase activity of the venom supernatant toward L,a-phosphatidyl choline was
assayed. Activity was measured spectrophotometrically, based on an absorbance change
of the pH indicator phenol red due to the liberation of free fatty acids. Significant
phospholipase activity was detected. This activity increased with the addition of calcium,
suggesting that the responsible enzyme is calcium-dependent. Activity was lost
subsequent to heating, suggesting that the responsible enzyme was denatured.
