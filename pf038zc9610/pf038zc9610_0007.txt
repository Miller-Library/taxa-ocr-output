likely not an indication of the absence of substrate or the end of the reaction but rather the
inability of the pH indicator to distinguish between increasingly acidic pHs.
To test the effect of calcium on phospholipase activity, an experiment was run
with 10 ul of venom, using the exact same conditions as before except without adding
CaCl to the reaction medium. (The normal reaction medium contained 10 mM CaCh.)
The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 4.
To test possible heat effects on enzyme stability, samples of venom supernatant
were heated for 5 min at 65°C or 5 min at 75°C. Following heating, 10 ul of heated
venom was used in the phospholipase assay. The decrease in activity subsequent to
heating as compared to an unheated sample is shown in Fig. 5.
The phospholipase activity of venom supernatant at various dilutions and
conditions are given in Table 1. The first measure of activity given is the decrease in
absorbance per min per ul of venom. The specific activity can be calculated by
calibrating the absorbance change with known mole quantities of hydrochloric acid. A
decrease in absorbance of 0.018 was obtained with 2.5 nmol of HCl in 1 ml of reaction
medium. Hydrolysis of one L,a-phosphatydyl choline molecule yields one L,a¬
lysophosphatydyl choline molecule and one fatty acid molecule. The specific activities
in terms of moles of fatty acid released per min per ul of venom are given. One unit of
phospholipase activity is defined as that amount of phospholipase that will hydrolyze 1.0
umol of L,a-phosphatydyl choline per min. Using this standard, the number of units of
activity of each reaction has been listed in Table 1.
