removed and stored at -20'C. The venom was used at that concentration in subsequent
experiments.
Hemolysis assay
The cytolytic effect of the venom supernatant was assayed using red blood cells
from goldfish. The goldfish were sacrificed by rapid decapitation. One to two drops of
released blood were dissolved in 100 ul of frog Ringer solution (120 mM NaCl, 2 mM
CaClz, 5 mM HEPES at pH 7.2). The red blood cells were incubated with various
dilutions of venom supernatant for 5 min. The number of intact cells in I large grid box
of a hemacytometer to which 10 ul of cells containing Ringer had been added was
counted.
Caseinase assay
Measurements of proteolytic activity were made according to the casein digestion
method of Marsh (1971). Caseinase assays were performed using a 0.5% casein solution:
10 mg of casein (Sigma) in a reaction volume of 2 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4. Dissolving of casein was done in an initial volume of 1 ml of phosphate
buffer in a boiling water bath for 15 min, to which the final 1 ml of phosphate buffer was
added. Venom supernatant or trypsin (Sigma) of various amounts was added to 2 ml of
casein solution to initiate potential casein digestion. Reactions were carried out for 20
min. at 25'C and were terminated by addition of 3 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to
precipitate undigested casein. After 30 min the solutions were filtered. The optical
densities of the filtrates were measured at 280 nm on a Shimadzu BioSpec-1601
spectrophotometer to detect digested casein in solution.
