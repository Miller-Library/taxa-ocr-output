INTRODUCTION
Conus californicus is a predatory marine snail found in the low intertidal and
subtidal zones along the western coast of North America, from San Francisco County in
the north to Baja California in the south (Morris et al. 1980). It preys regularly on
polychaetes, gastropods, and bivalves. As with the approximately 500 other cone snail
species (Olivera 1997), C. californicus has a highly derived radula, reduced to a set of
harpoon-like teeth, which it uses to inject neurotoxic peptides into its prey. Conus venom
is produced in a venom bulb (Maguire and Kwan 1992), which is attached to the
esophagus by a venom duct. The teeth are secreted from the radula sac and passed into
the esophagus, just anterior to the venom duct. From there, they are passed up the
proboscis and are injected into prey from the tip of the proboscis.
Significant research has focused on the small disulfide-rich peptides present in
cone snail venoms, which target calcium and sodium channels as well as various
membrane receptors (Kerr et al. 1984; Mclntosh et al. 1995; Olivera 1997; Duda 1999).
Larger protein components are present in cone snail venoms, but they are less well
described. Mclntosh et al. (1995) describe phospholipase activity in Conus magus, but
this appears to be the only published account of such activity in the genus.
Phospholipases are common in the venoms of a diverse set of venomous animal
taxa, including snakes (Nisenbom et al. 1986; Faure and Bon 1988; Ali et al. 1999), bees
(Ho and Ko 1988; Abe et al. 2000), arachnids (Conde et al. 1999), and sea anemones
(Grotendorst and Hessinger 2000). Phospholipases catalyze the hydrolysis of
phospholipids with varying specificity. Phospholipase Az, the most common
phospholipase component of venoms, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl ester of
