Caseinase assay
In the caseinase assay, venom supernatant was added to 2-ml solutions of 0.5%
casein in amounts of 10 ul, 5 ul, 1 ul, 0.1 ul, and 0 ul (control). Trypsin was used as a
positive control in concentrations of 10 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, and 0
mg/ml (control). Absorbance increases due to digested casein in solution are plotted in
Fig. 2. Venom supernatant caused only an insignificant increase in the absorbance of the
filtrate: 0.072 to 0.081 absorbance units. Trypsin caused an increase in absorbance of the
filtrate from 0.012 to 1.834 absorbance units.
One unit of caseinase activity is defined as that amount of enzyme that causes an
increase of 0.001 absorbance units per minute. Absorbance change due to addition of 10
ul of venom corresponds to an activity of 0.45 units. The activity of trypsin varied from
29.6 units for 0.1 mg/ml to 91.7 units for 10 mg/ml. One unit of venom can be
extrapolated from this to be 11 ul/ml. One unit of trypsin is 0.0034 mg/ml, as calculated
by the initial reaction rate suggested by the 0.1 mg/ml sample.
Phospholipase assay
The phospholipase activity of the venom supernatant was detected in amounts of
1 ul, 10 ul, and 50 ul in a reaction volume of 1 ml. Activity increased with increasing
venom concentrations. These data are presented in Fig. 3, which shows the decrease in
optical density of phenol red at 558 nm, corresponding to a decrease in pH of the solution
due to the release of free fatty acids by phospholipase. The assay is not reliable beyond
an aborbance change of about -1 absorbance unit. That absorbance is the absorbance of
fully acidified phenol red solution, and the dye is unaffected below a certain pH. Hence,
the flattening of the 50 ul curve at an absorbance change of about -1 absorbance units is
