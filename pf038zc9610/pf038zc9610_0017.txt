Fig. 1. Relative numbers of goldfish red blood cells intact after treatment with four
venom dilutions in frog Ringer solution after incubation for 5 min. A 1:10
dilution of venom in the presence of 2 mM CaClz is sufficient to lyse all the red
blood cells.
Fig. 2. Increase in absorbance (at 280 nm) of TCA-precipitated casein following
digestion by venom supernatant or trypsin. Venom supernatant does not
detectably degrade casein in comparison to trypsin, which had significant activity
with the lowest concentration tested (0.1 mg/ml). The slight increase in
absorbance from 0 ul venom to 10 ul venom can be attributed to the absorbance
of the added venom alone.
Fig. 3. Concentration-dependent decrease in optical density of phenol red at 558 nm,
corresponding to a decrease in pH of the solution due to the release of free fatty
acids via phospholipase activity. Reactions of 1 ul, 10 ul, and 50 ul in the
presence of 10 mM CaClz are shown.
Fig. 4. Calcium-dependence of phospholipase activity, using the same assay as in Fig. 3.
Decrease in optical density over time is shown for reactions of 10 ul venom with
and without presence of 10 mM CaCl.
