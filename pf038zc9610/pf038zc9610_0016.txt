Table 1. Phospholipase activities of reactions with various venom concentrations and
conditions. Activities are given in change in absorbance per min per ul venom, moles
fatty acid produced per min per ul venom, and units of phospholipase activity. The
apparent drop in activity with increasing concentrations is due to normalizing the
activities according to the amount of venom used. This reflects the diminishing effect of
adding more venom due to the rate-limiting kinetics of the reaction.
