DISCUSSION
The hemolysis assay indicates that venom supernatant is lethal to red blood cells,
with a 1:10 dilution sufficient to kill all the red blood cells within 5 min, and even a
1:10000 dilution had a significant effect. The complete disintegration of cells suggests
that highly active membrane degradation could be taking place. The solution used for
hemolysis assays contained 2 mM CaCl, which has implications for phospholipase
activity. The pH of the solution was 7.2, close to the caseinase assay pH of 7.4 and the
phospholipase assay pH of 7.6.
In the caseinase assay, the small change in absorbance (-0.009 absorbance units)
of the filtrate after reaction with venom corresponds closely to the change in absorbance
of 2 ml of PBS upon addition of 10 ul of venom: 0.002 to 0.010 absorbance units. This
suggests that the venom has little detectable caseinase activity, or at most activity
corresponding to an increase in optical density of just 0.001. By comparison, at the
manufacturer's suggested concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, trypsin cleaved a visibly detectable
amount of casein. Increases in trypsin activity were observed at every higher
concentration used. Future experiments might explore possible caseinase activity at
different pHs and with higher concentrations of venom supernatant. Nevertheless, it
appears that caseinase activity, and presumably protease activity in general, is not
responsible for the cytolytic effect observed on red blood cells.
Duct venom from Conus californicus appears to possess robust phospholipase
activity. As would be expected, phospholipase activity increases with increasing
concentrations of venom. The loss in activity subsequent to heating the venom
supernatant suggests that a heat-labile enzyme is responsible for the acidification of the
