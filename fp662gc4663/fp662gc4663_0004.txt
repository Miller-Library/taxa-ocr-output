nique as outlined in the E-C bulletin was a modification of the
time necessary for separation of the slower migrating Molluscan
proteins. The gels were run for either 90 or 180 minutes at 400 y.
The gels were stained for total protein in a saturated sol-
ution of Amido black. Peroxidase activity was detected through
staining with ortho-dianisidine, following the procedure of Man-
well and Baker (1963). This method of staining allows the loca-
tion of enzy matic peroxidases and the pseudo-peroxidases, hemo-
globin and hemocyanin. Fifteen to twenty-five minutes after the
gel was placed in the dye solution, approximately 20 drops of
dilute 30% hydrogen peroxide were added. Brown bands began to
appear about  hour where peroxidases had oxidized the dye. Full
color developement was complete 1 hours after the gel was placed
in the dianisidine. The gel was subsequently washed in distilled
water and placed in the Amido black solution for total protein
staining. The dianisidine was stable to any further staining and.
using the abowe procedure, no problems of an over developed back-
ground color or fading of the peroxidase bands were encountered.
Weiser (1965) states that the addition of a 5% solution of
KCN to Crustacean sera containing hemocyanin cleaves the copper
from its protein, resulting in the formation of free apo-hemo-
cyanin and inhibition of peroxidase activity. This apo-hemocyanin
migrates with about  its former speed, joining the free apo-hemo-
cyanin already present in the blood. In the present study the
sera were incubated with equal amounts of KCN at 7Â° C for at least
2 hours and then compared on the same gel with samples not treated
with KCN. The finished gel was stained for peroxidase and total
protein.
Whittaker's method (1959) of staining hemocyanin containing
gels with rubeanic acid for copper was used; however it did not
