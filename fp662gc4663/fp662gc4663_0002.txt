INTRODUCTION:
The respiratory pigments hemoglobin and hemocyanin are both
found in members of the Arthropod class Crustacea. Hemocyanin
has largely been restricted to the Malacostraca while the dis-
tribution of hemoglobin has been reported as being random and
diverse among the lower Crustacea (Fox, 1957). It is therefore
not surprising that hemoglobin has been observed by Fox in sey-
eral species of parasitic barnacles and by Southward (1963) in
three free living species, including Balanus perforatus, Balanus
crenatus, and Elminius modestus. However Southward's studies
have been conducted primarily on the muscle tissue of these bar-
nacles.
A great deal of success has been achieved by Manwell & Baker
(1963) and subsequent investigators in the separation and iden-
tification of blood respiratory proteins by means of starch gel
electrophoresis. These investigations have been conducted pri-
marily on .he hemocyanins of the Malacostraca. Such methods have
never been used in a study of the respiratory pigments of the lower
Crustacean orders. Accordingly, the barnacle, Balanus nubilis, a
particularly large cirriped found in the intertidal regions of
Monterey Bay, California, was chosen for study. Although the
initial purpose of this study was to determine whether or not
a respiratory pigment was present in the blood of B. nubilis, the
use of Molluscan and Crustacean hemocyanins as well as hunan hemo-
globin as standards made a comparative electrophoretic study of
these sera possible.
Despite preliminary data which implied the presence of hemo-
cyanin, final results strongly suggest that hemoglobin is present
in the blood of B. nubilis.
