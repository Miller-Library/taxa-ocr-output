prove in this case to be sensitive enough for the small quantities
of material separated. The technique was used quite successfully
on whole blood samples.
The absorption spectrum of the B. nubilis blood was obtained
on a Beckman DK-2A Ratio-Recording Spectrophotometer. Deoxy-hemo-
globin was prepared by reduction of the sample with sodium dithioÂ¬
nite (Fox, 1960). The same procedure was applied to the B. nubilis
blood. Sodium hydrosulfite was also used as a reducing agent.
RESULTS:
The blood of B. nubilis was found to be extremely unstable.
Naturally forming clots were massive and the gel that formed tended
to take all of the proetins out of solution. The use of EDTA and
high speed centrifugation was the best of several methods that
were attempted at limiting clot formation, although no method
fully prevented it. This instability was a major problem when-
ever chemical treatment of the centrifuged samples was attempted.
Isolation of specific proteins through differential precipitation
with ammonium sulfate, deoxygenation of the blood with sodium di-
thionite, and most other test reagents added to the blood resulted
in immediate, irreversable clotting or the denaturation of the
blood proteins.
bloed
a absorpticn spectrum of the B. nubiliseshowed the presence
of three major peaks at 418, 460, and 490mu, with relatively heavy
absorption up to 620my. The peak at 418m suggested the presence
of a Soret band and an attempt was made to isolate the protein
responsible for this peak by fractional precipitation, but the
difficulties mentioned earlier made this impossible. Since hemo-
globin was suspected, an attempt was also made to deoxygenate the
blood with sodium dithionite. This would cause the characteristic
spectral shift of the Soret band to 430ma which accompanies the
