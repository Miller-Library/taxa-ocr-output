protein. No iron or heme cleavage is known to occur as a result
of this reaction. The B. nubilis blood shows, however, a definite
strengthening of the slower migrating band B corresponding to the
decline in peroxidase activity at band D.
DISCUSSION:
These experiments again emphasize the extreme heterogeneity
of hemocyanins both between the Arthropods and Molluscs, and within
the different Molluscan genera. Completely different protein com-
plexes are indicated for each of the species studied by the dif-
ferences in their migration and the variable occurance of the
"Tast" and "slow" components. The generalizations that are made
concerning the reaction of the cyanide ion with Crustacean hemo-
the
cyanins are not entirely valid in Mollusca, though it is plain
that KCN definitely affects hemocyanin migration. The failure of
Molluscan hemocyanins to show peroxidase activity is yet another
of their unusual properties. No explanation for this phenomenon
can be given on the basis of this study.
A clear spectrum of hemoglobin in D. nubilis with a Soret
band at Alömu and alpha and beta bands at 545mu and 580mu was
never obtained. This was due to the presence of considerable mis¬
cellaneous absorption between 490muand 620m. Furthermore the for-
mation of deoxy-hemoglobin could not be adequately achieved be-
cause of the instability ofthe blood. The following experimental
data does support the presence of hemoglobin in B. nubilis:
1. The absorption spectrum of whole blood has what appears to
be a Soret band, characteristic of the heme group, at 4184.
A partial shift of this peak towards 430mu does occur when attempts
are made to deoxygenate the blood, thus suggesting the formation
of deoxy-hemoglobin. (cf. Fig. 1)
2. According to Pearse (1961), peroxidase activity that is stable
18.
