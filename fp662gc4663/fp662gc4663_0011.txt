total protein. Proteins are represented by dark bands;
peroxidase activity is shown by stippling. The sera
shown are: 1. Balanus nubilis, 2. Human hemoglobin,
3. Haliotus cracherodii, 4. Megathura crenulata.
5. Pachygrapsu:
es. Note that peroxidase activity
crassi
is limited to the immedate area occupied by the "fast"
hemocyanin protein in P. crassipes and that no peroxiÂ¬
dase activity is present in the Haliotus and Megathura.
Fig. 3 : A composite gel stained for peroxidase activity and
total protein. Odd numbered slots contain the same
sera and in the same order as Fig. 2. They are:
1. B. nubilis, 2. Hunan hemoglobin, 3. H. cracherodii,
4. M. crenulata, and 5. P. crassipes. Even numbered
slots contain the corresponding sera incubated with KCN.
Protein is again represented by dark bands, peroxidase
by stippling.
