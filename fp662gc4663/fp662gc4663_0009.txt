to heat is a property of the pseudo-peroxidases, hemoglobin and
hemocyanin. The peroxidase activity of B. nubilis is stable to
heat as well as other forms of denaturation.
3. The general distribution of respiratory pigments in Crustacea
and the fact that hemoglobin has been found in two Balanus species
would make the presence of hemocyanin in B. nubiliss unlikely.
4. Both the diffuse nature of the peroxidase activity of B. nub-
ilis blood and the gradual and incomplete inhibition of this acti-
vity upon the addition of KCN at band D bears close resemblance to
the behavior of human hemoglobin under similar conditions and none
to that
shown by hemocyanin.
The one test that suggested the presence of hemocyanin in
B. nubilis was the reaction of band D to cyanide treatment. The
corresponding strengthening of band B with the inhibition of per-
oxidase activity at band D would appear initially to be caused by
the fornation of an apo-protein. The hemoglobins of lower Crus-
tacea are known to te very large molecules, approaching the hemo-
cyanins in size and complexity (Waterman, 1960). Therefore it may
be that in a molecule of this sige some spontaneous hydrolysis of
the large protein, band D, releas large protein fragments, band
B. The cyanide anion would then appear to speed up this reaction,
quite independantly of its inhibition of peroxidase activity.
The complexity and size of the Crustacean hemoglobin molecule may
result in the formation of "fast" and "sdow" hemoglobin components
on electrophoretic patterns (possibly bands D & C The probability
is much greater, however, that this bandC, like band A, is a tissue
or enzymatic peroxidase as described by Manwell & Baker (1903).
