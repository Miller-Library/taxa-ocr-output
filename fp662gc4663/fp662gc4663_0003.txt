MATERIALS & METHODS:
B. nubilis was collected from about the Orl foot tidal
level from pilings in Monterey Bay. The blood was collected from
the barnacles by means of a syringe injected into the large blood
sinus located immediately anterior to the mouth, between the body
and the adductor muscle. Ineorder to limit clotting, the syringe
was cooled to 0° C and filled with O.1 cc of a 10% EDTA solution
before the blood was removed from the sinus. Samples from an
average of four animals were collected in this manner and pooled,
vielding 6 cc of blood. This blood was placed in a plastic tube
and centrifuged immediately at 18000g for one hour at 00 C. This
removed any clot that had formed and any tissue or particulate
matter that would enhance further clotting. The supernatant was
either placed immediately in the gel or concentrated with Sephadex
G-200 just prior to electrophoretic separation.
The rock crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes (Randall, 1839), the
black abalone, Haliotus cracherodii (Leach, 1817), and a large
keyhole limpet, Megathura crenulata (Sowerby, 1825), were used as
sources of known hemocyanin while hemoglobin was obtained from
the whole blood of the experimenter. Small amounts of 10% EDTA
were sufficient to prevent massive clotting in the Molluscan and
crab sera and samples could be transferred directly from the ani¬
mals to the gel. Human blood cells were lysed in a homogenizer
and diluted with the same EDTA solution.
Samples were separated on poly-acrylamide gels using Cyano-
gun-41 (Fisher C-388). An E-C vertica gel electrophoresis appa¬
ratus was used throughout as were the procedures outlined in Tech¬
nical Bulletin 41 of the E-C Apparatus Corp. Tris-HOl buffer,
pH 8.9, was used as the gel buffer, while Tris-glycine buffer,
pH 8.3, was used in the chamber. The only variation in the tech-
