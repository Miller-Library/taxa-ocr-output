reduction of oxy-hemoglobin to deoxy-hemoglobin. Partial deoxy-
genation appeared to he achieved with the addition of small amounts
of sodium dithionite and a slight shift was observed (Fig. 1).
Further reduction was impossible due again to the instability of
the blood. Other reducing agents had the same effect.
Total protein staining for B. nubilis resulted in the ap-
pearance of five protein bends, hereafter referred to as bands
A, B, C, D, & E, in order of migration from the sample slot (Fig. 2)
Only three bands, A, B & D, appeared consistently. The appearance
of bands C & E was rather random and due apparently to the quality
and freshness of the sample. Human hemoglobin could be seen as a
red band migrating in the gel with a much weaker band in front of
it.
Manwell & Baker (1963) describe the separation of apparently
homogeneous hemocyanins into "fast" and "slow" components as a
result of electrophoretic separation. This effect was observed
in the Pach
grapsus serum with what appeared to be two hemocyanin
components and a weaker, non-hemocyanin protein between them. A
slower apo-hemocyanin protein was also present as was the typically
streaking fibrinogen above it. In agreement with Manwell & Baker's
observation that molluscan hemocyanins migrate slower than Arth-
ropod hemocyanins, the Megathura serum showed two hemocyenin com-
ponents, both migrating about one eighth as fast as Pachygrapsus
hemocyanin. The Haliotus hemocyanin was a single, broad band
with several non-hemocyanin proteins occasionally seen ahead of it.
Peroxidase activity was noted in the B. nubilis proteins at
three points, corresponding with bands A, C, when it appeared,
and exceptionally strong peroxidase activity around band D. A
similarly strong and diffuse band of peroxidase activity was also
noted with human hemoglobin. The dianisidine was oxidized by the
