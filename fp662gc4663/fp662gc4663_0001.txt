ABSTRACT
1. On electrophoretic separation, a total of 5 protein bands
were detected in the Balanus nubilis blood.
2. Three of the proteins present in B. nubilis blood showed
peroxidase activity. Because of tests performed on the fastest
of these proteins and absorption spectra obtained for the whole
blodd, this fast protein is assumed to be hemoglobin.
3. Molluscan hemocyanins migrate much slower than Crustacean
hemocyanins and, in some species, split up into electrophoretiÂ¬
respiratory pigments consistently showed strong peroxidase
activity.
