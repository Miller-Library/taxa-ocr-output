Pachygraasus proteins only at the immediate location of the fastest
migrating "fast" hemocyanin. Twenty gels were stained for per-
oxidase with slightly different procedures each time. In all of
these experiments, the Molluscan hemocyanins never showed per-
oxidase activity. Variations in timing in the addition of per-
oxide, concentrations of the dye solutions, light and dark, and
pH of the buffers were employed. Weiser (1565) states that de¬
naturation by heat increased the peroxidase activity of Arthro-
pod hemocyanins. Accordingly gels were incubated at 70° C for
one hour with no positive results. Likewise, chemical denatur-
ation through incubation of the gel in methanol and 8M urea gave
similar results. Tests performed on boiled whole blood for per-
oxidase were also negative. In all of the above experiments, the
peroxidase activity of the B. nubilis blood was present and stable,
at band D.
The addition of KCN to the crab serum produced a quantitive
olvno
shift to apo-hemocyanin, apparentlyxof all three faster migrating
proteins. Some denaturation of the sample could be the reason for
the disappearance of the non-hemocyanin protein. (Fig. 3) The
cyanide effect on molluscan sera was sumewhat different. The two
Megathura bands were unified into a single band that migrated be-
tween them. The Haliotus hemocyanin however appeared to be cleaved
into two proteins, a reaction probably occuring independantly of
the cleavage of copper. This effect was complete for the hemo¬
cyanins at the end of the two hour incubation.
In the B. nubilis and human bloods, the addition of cyanide
caused the gradual inhibition of peroxidase activity, though the
reduction in activity compared with an untreated sample was quite
visible. This effect is due in hemoglobins to the bonding of the
iron and the cyanide ion, blocking the respiratory function of the
