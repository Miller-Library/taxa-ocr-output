apical blades, thereby slowing growth rates and reducing the C:N ratio as a consequence of the
nitrogen built up in the tissue relative to faster growing portions. We further postulated that a
reduced C:N ratio could make blades more palatable to microbes and grazers, thus resulting in
greater rates of erosion.
Methods
The experiment was conducted in the shallow kelp forests of the Hopkins Marine Life
Refuge in Monterey, CA (36° 36’ N, 121° 54' W). Pairs of kelp fronds of similar length were
selected from twenty Macrocystis pyrifera sporophytes. The apical meristems were removed
from one frond of each pair by severing the stipe 25cm below the first dividing pneumatocyst on
the apical scimitar (Figl). The paired un-cut frond was used as a control. Growth and
deterioration rates were determined by the commonly used hole-punch technique (Rothäusler et
al., 2009) in paired blades 30 cm below the apical meristem (Fig.1) and compared in situ after
seven days and in the laboratory after sixteen days. Tissue was collected from each blade from
three holes approximately 17.5mm in diameter punched consecutively proceeding from the
growth measuring hole toward the pneumatocyst. The algal tissue was dried in an oven at 120°C
for 48hours and then ground with a ball mill (will check name) for thirty seconds per sample to a
fine powder for use in chemical analyses.
A colorimetric method (sensu White et al. 2010) was employed in order to compare
concentrations of mannitol in fronds with and without apical meristems. Mannitol was extracted
by heating 30mg of powdered kelp in 1.5 ml of water at 80 °C, centrifuging at 14000rpm for
30min, and removing the supernatant. 100 uL of this mannitol extract was added to 500 uL
formate buffer (0.5 mol L", pH 2.85). After mixing, 300 uL of Reagent 1 (5 mmol L* sodium
periodate) was added followed by 300 uL of Reagent 2 (consisting of 0.1 mol L * acetylacetone,
