Analysis of Mannitol concentrations revealed that blades from fronds without apical
meristems had a significantly lower percent mannitol by dry weight as compared with controls
=4.2079, n=10, p=.0018) (Fig.4). However, the average percent carbon of blades from
manipulated fronds was significantly higher than that of controls (t-3.9597, n=17,
p=.0011)(Fig.5). No significant difference in percent Nitrogen was found between blades from
manipulated fronds (t=1.1807, n=17, p=.2549). Accordingly, the C:N ratio was significantly
higher for blades from manipulated fronds than those of controls (t-2.1648, n-17, p-.0448)
(Fig.6).
Discussion
High growth rates (Fig. 1) and an increased C:N ratio (Fig. 6)in blades from fronds
without apical meristems as compared with controls contradicted our initial hypotheses. While
reduced mannitol (Fig. 4) and increased erosion in blades from manipulated fronds (Fig.3) were
consistent with initial predictions, the causes of these changes are likely different than those that
were previously anticipated.
The increased growth rates of blades from fronds without apical meristems may still be
consistent with results from Parker (1965) and Lobban (1978) where fronds without their apex
no longer had any acropetal translocation (solute movement up the frond) but only basipetal
translocation (toward the holdfast). Translocation in Macrocystis is driven by osmotic gradient
whereby mature, "source" blades with a relative excess of mannitol and amino acids uptake
water which then flows with the solutes to immature, "sink" blades which excrete water to
encourage the flow (Schmitz 1982). If translocation upwards were halted with the loss of the
apical meristems, it would follow that the higher growth rates in blades from manipulated fronds
resulted from the fact that the manipulated blade would receive no imports but also would no
