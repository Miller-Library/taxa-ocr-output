2 mol L“ ammonium acetate and 20 mmol L-1 sodium thiosulfate) was added. Reagent 2 was
always added 15 s after Reagent 1. The tube was then closed and heated in boiling water for 2
min, cooled under running tap water and measured with a spectrophotometer at 412 nm. Each
sample was diluted with water at: 1:10, 1:15, 1:20, and 1:50 vol/vol. Mannitol concentrations
were determined for each sample by cross-referencing with standards of varied concentrations
from which a linear relationship between absorbance and mannitol concentrations were obtained.
Due to the relatively low concentration of mannitol in M. pyrifera as compared with those
reported for other kelps by White et al. (2010) the full strength solution was used to calculate
percent mannitol.
In order to quantify Carbon and Nitrogen content, dried kelp powder in duplicate samples
was weighed on a Sartorius supermicro balance, and assayed for total N and C with a Carlo Erba
Na-1500 elemental analyser calibrated with acetanilide.
All data were analyzed using two-tailed, paired T-tests between blades from fronds with
and without apical meristems from each sporophyte.
Results
Äfter one week of growth, blades from fronds where the apical meristem was removed
grew significantly more quickly than intact controls (t=2.332, n-20, p=.0308) (Fig. 2). However,
after between days 7 and 14 the difference in growth rates was no longer significant (t=1.1136,
n=17, p=.281). The measure of erosion revealed that elongation occurred between the punched
hole and the blade tip. Äfter one week, blades from fronds with the apical meristems removed
had an average increase of distance from the punched hole to the blade tip of 3.Scm which was
significantly less than the average 6.6 cm of controls (t-2.124, n-20, p=.0467) (fig. 3). After 14
days the difference was no longer significant (t=.7804, n-17, p=.4445).
