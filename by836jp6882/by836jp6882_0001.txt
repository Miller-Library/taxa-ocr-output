Effects of the loss of the Apical Meristem on Growth and Tissue Composition in
Macrocystis pyrifera
Abstract
Changes to the physiology or chemistry of basal producers can have direct consequences
for consumers and the transfer of energy between trophic levels. As a foundation species, giant
kelp Macrocystis pyrifera sustains high growth rates and primary productivity under dense
shading canopies through an efficient system of translocation that provides energy and nutrients
to growing tissues. This study investigated what impact removing the growing point or apical
meristem from M. pyrifera, as occurs in storms, commercial harvest and historically in grazing
by the Stellar's sea cow, has on the physiology of the remaining immature sub-apical blades.
Blades from fronds experienced increased growth and erosion rates within the first week after
removal of the apical meristem as compared with controls. Ã„fter two weeks growth and erosion
rates were no longer significantly different between manipulated blades and control but
substantial differences in concentrations of the sugar mannitol as well as nitrogen and carbon
content persisted. The study revealed physiological effects of apical meristem loss that merit
further investigation as to their causal mechanisms and suggest the potential for meristem
removal to alter interactions with primary consumers.
