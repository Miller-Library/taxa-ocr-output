growing blades import them to aid in growth (Schmitz & Lobban, 1976; Schmitz & Srivastava,
1979).
Apical meristems serve as an important sink drawing metabolites up the fronds toward
the rapidly growing blades at the apex (Lobban 1978a; Schmitz & Srivastava 1979). Early work
suggested that fronds without apical meristems no longer translocate materials up the frond but
instead send them down toward the base (Lobban, 1978a). However, little work has been
conducted explicitly to understand how the loss of the apical meristem affects blades remaining
on Macrocystis fronds.
The apical meristems of Macrocystis are commonly lost to storm damage (Seymour, M
J Tegner, Dayton, & Parnell, 1989) and many more are removed during canopy cutting for
commercial harvest (Doty, 1987). Moreover, historically, canopy grazing by the immense
Stellar’s sea cow (once abundant from California to Japan, now extinct) would have frequently
removed Macrocystis apical meristems (Burger, 1995). Reduced translocation could potentially
result in physiological changes to the remaining blades with rippling ecological effects with
direct and indirect consequences for organisms that interact with Macrocystis blades such as
microbial biofilms (Bengtsson, Sjøtun, Storesund, & Ovreås, 2011; Duggins, Simenstad, & J.
Estes, 1989; Norderhaug, Fredriksen, & Nygaard, 2003), epiphytic sessile invertebrates (Dixon.
S.C. Schroeter, & Kastendiek, 1981; Hepburn & Hurd, 2005), and invertebrate mesograzers
(Duggins, Eckman, Siddon, & Klinger, 2001; Foster & Schiel, 1985; McMillan, 2010;
Norderhaug et al., 2003; Watanabe, 1984)
In this study we sought to address what effect the removal of the apical meristem has on
the growth rate and chemical composition of the remaining sub-apical blades. We hypothesized
that the loss of the apical meristem would halt translocation of mannitol to the remaining sub¬
