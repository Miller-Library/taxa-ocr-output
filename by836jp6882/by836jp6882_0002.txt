Introduction
In many different ecosystems changes to the physiology or chemistry of basal producers
can have direct consequences for consumers and the transfer of energy between trophic levels
(Moe et al. 2005). Changes in tissue chemistry for autotrophs particularly have the potential to
alter palatability to herbivores through shifts in concentrations of secondary metabolites,
nutritional content, and structural stability (Hemmi & Jormalainen, 2002; Poore & Steinberg,
1999). Understanding changes in basal producers that may take place as a result of
environmental shifts or anthropogenic impacts can yield important insights into the flow of
energy through and nutrient cycling between trophic levels (Graham 2004).
The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera functions as a foundation species forming dense
forests upon which diverse communities of organisms rely for food and shelter in temperate
coastal waters around the globe(Arkema, Reed, & Stephen C Schroeter, 2009; Dayton, 1985;
Graham, 2004; Mann, 2000; Steneck et al., 2003). Its astonishingly high rates of growth and
primary productivity form the basis for numerous natural food webs and support expansive
canopies that sustain commercial harvests for various human uses (Buschmann & Hernandez-
Gonzalez, 2005; Doty, 1987; Gutierrez et al., 2006; Mann, 1973). Kelp growth is sustained by an
efficient system of translocation that moves energy and nutrients from mature portions of the
kelp to the growing points at the end of the fronds—the apical meristems (Lobban, 1978b; North,
1971). Detailed studies with "C tracers and fluorescein dye demonstrated that photosynthates
move at rates of up to 78 cm/hr both up and down the fronds of Macrocystis (Parker, 1963;
1965). The translocated substances— the sugar mannitol, amino acids, and inorganic ions¬
follow a “source-sink" dynamic: fully developed blades export these materials while immature,
