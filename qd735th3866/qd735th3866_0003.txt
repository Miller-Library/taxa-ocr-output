ERIALS AND METHODS
Chthamalus fissus, all 3 mm. in width and of the morph with the slit
aperature (Morris et al., 1980), were collected from both the RR tracks
and breakwater collecting sites (Fig. 1), tidal heights of 1.2 m and 1.5 m
respectively, and Balanus glandula, all 4 mm. in width, were collected from
the RR tracks collecting site near Hopkins Marine Station in the spring of
1982. During low tide, barnacles, on small pieces of granite, were chiselled
from rocks in the intertidal and then mounted in plasicene in rows on three
shelves (Fig. 2). They were then submerged in a 2000 liter aquarium at the
time they would normally have been submerged at the next high tide in the
field.
Many physical parameters have been shown to influence the activity of a
barnacle, among them: oxygen concentration (Newell and Northcroft, 1965).
pH (Southward and Crisp, 1965), water currents (Southward and Crisp, 1965).
temperature (Cole, 1932; Southward, 1955) and food availability (Kuznetsova,
1978). To keep these physical factors constant and approximating ambient
conditions, fresh sea water was circulated through the aquarium in a very
slow, constant flow. An additional study was done in standing water with
all other procedures identical, where the water running into the tank was
shut off 12 hours before the barnacles were placed in the aquarium.
In the circulating sea water, the temperature of the water was 13.7i 0.2
degrees Celsius, while in the standing water the temperature was 14.72 0.3
degrees Celsius.
The barnacles were illuminated by a constant red light source reflected
off a sheet of white plastic resulting in an intensity of 1.7 lux. All direct
light was blocked. (Fig. 2)
Activity of barnacles was monitored using a video camera and recorder.
Each barnacle was viewed for presence or absense of cirral activity for 15
