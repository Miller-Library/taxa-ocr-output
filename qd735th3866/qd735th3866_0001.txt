An endogenous circatidal rhythm was described in both individuals and
populations of the upper intertidal barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus
fissus. These rhythms persisted for at least 8 days under constant conditions
with peaks of activity initially corresponding to times of high tide.
A circatidal period of 27 hours was observed in activity of Balanus glandula,
while the period of activity of Chthamalus fissus, 25 hours, was much closer
to that of the tidal cycle. No circadian rhythms were observed in any
individuals or populations studied under constant conditions or in the field.
The hypothesis was made that the adaptive advantage of such an endogenous
rhythm would be in the ability to anticipate periods of activity and inactÂ¬
ivity and physiologically prepare for them.
