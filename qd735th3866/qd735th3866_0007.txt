TON AND CONCL
Populations as well asindividuals of both B. glandula and C. fissus,
from sheltered locations, showed persistant rhythms in cirral activity when
submerged in constant conditions in the lab. The fact that not all indiv¬
iduals', or even populations', activity rhythms had the same period and were
not always in phase with each other or the tidal cycle supports the conclu¬
sion that the rhythmic nature of activity was endogenous rather than cued
by an exogenous factor. This is corroborated by the result that the C. fissus
tested in standing, rather than circulating, sea water also exhibitted
rhythmic activity with circatidal periodicity.
During a qualitative field study conducted by the author over a two
month period, cirral activity in both B. glandula and C. fissus was observed
during any period of submersion, regardless of the day-night condition.
Considering this, it is not at all surprising that no circadian rhythms were
observed in constant conditions. Perhaps, being submerged for such short
periods each day, 5-20% of each tide cycle for barnacles at a tide height of
1.6 m.(Glynn, 1965), and sometimes not for 23 days in a row (Glynn, 1965),
it is important for these upper intertidal barnacles to be active whenever
possible, even at the risk of predation during daylight hours.
On the other hand, the utilization of an endogenous circatidal clock
would be of tremendous adaptive advantage. Since these barnacles are sub¬
merged for such short periods of time, it is probably very important for
them to maximize their feeding time within these periods. An endogenous
circatidal clock would enable them to prepare themselves physiologically
just before potential periods of inundation — enabling immediate activity
response upon submersion.
Without such a clock, they would either have to unneccessarily remain
continuously prepared for activity, even at times of low tide, or possibly
