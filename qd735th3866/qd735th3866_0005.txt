RESU
Activit
Rhythms in Circulating Sea Water:
Most individuals of both B. glandula and C. fissus showed persistant
activity rhythms with circatidal periodicity upon visual analysis. (Fig 3,
4 and 5) Although the activity patterns are scattered with irregularity,
due to the variability in activity of individuals, there is a definite
correlation between the peaks of activity and the time of high tide. This
circatidal rhythmicity in some individuals (430, #20 and #13) seems to have
persisted for at least 8 days.
By summing the activity of the individuals in each of these three pop-
ulations, the individual variability was averaged out and the rhythms in
activity became much more apparent. Each of the two C. fissus and the
B. glandula populations demonstrated clearly visible circatidal rhythms,
(Fig 6 and 2) which persisted in constant conditions for at least 8 days.
When the two populations of C. fissus, from the two similar collecting sites,
were analyzed as a combined population, the rhythm became even more obvious.
(Fig. 8) The general increase in activity of C. fissus populations and
decrease in activity of the B. glandula population were due to an increase
or decrease in the number of indivuals active,rather than a change in the actÂ¬
ivity level of the already active individuals.
The period of the rhythm, as determined by visual analysis with special
attention directed to the peaks of activity after the 5 day gap in data,
was different in B. glandula than in Q fissus, even from colecting sites
very close to each other. The rhythm of activity in B, glandula was deter-
nined to be approximately 27 hours, while is was approximately 25 hours in
C. fissus. No circadian periodicity was observed in any of the data.
