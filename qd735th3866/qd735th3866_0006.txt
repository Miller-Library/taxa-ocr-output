Activity Rhythms in Standing Sea Water:
Most C. fissus individuals monitored in still sea water expressed
tidal activity rhythms similar to those in circulating sea water, (Fig. 9)
persisting for at least 60 hours. However, many of the individuals' rhythms
were not consistantly in phase with each other or the tidal cycle, so popÂ¬
ulation analysis gave arhythmic results. The average period of the activity
rhythms, as determined by the same method used in the circulating sea water
study, was determined to be approximately 25 hours, very near that of the
tidal cycle. As in the study with circulating sea water, no circadian
rhythm was observed.
