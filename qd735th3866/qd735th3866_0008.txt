miss periods of potential feeding at the start of each inundation while
physiologically changing from an inactive state. By using an endogenous clock,
they would be able to predict times of activity and utilize times of inÂ¬
activity accordingly. This hypothesis is supported by a study in which
Balanus balanoides were observed to show a differential response to wetting
with respect to time before the next high tide, becoming most responsive just
before inundation. (Arnold, 1970)
This suggests that some interesting physiological and biochemical
correlates of this cirotidal rhythm may prove fruitful for further investigation.
