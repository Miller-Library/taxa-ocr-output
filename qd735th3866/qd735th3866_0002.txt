The upper intertidal barnacles Chthamalus fissus,,Darwin, 1854, and
Balanus glandula, Darwin, 1854, are active only during periods of submersion
at high tide. Since their activity is so greatly dependent on a predictable
oscillating exogènous factor, it seems that anendogenous circatidal rhythm
would be an adaptive character. An endogenous tidal clock would allow them
to anticipate periods of activity and inactivity and physiologically prepare
themselves.
Persisting activity rhythms with approximate tidal periodicity have
been described in many intertidal organisms. (Palmer, 1974) Several attempts
have been made to establish tidal rhythmicity in barnacles to date, yet these
have only resulted in observations of rhythms with periods of 25-35 days
(Sommer, 1972) and 2-50 minutes. (Southward and Crisp, 1965) An unpublished
student paper (Carlson and Roux, 1978) did describe a tidal rhythm in the
activity of C. fissus and C. dalli with periodograms based on sampling every
3 hours. Besides these students' study, no work has yet been done docu¬
menting an endogenous tidal rhythm in barnacles. The objective of this
study was to show conclusively whether the upper intertidal barnacles, C.
Tissus and B. glandula exhibit endogenous tidal rhythms in cirral activity
