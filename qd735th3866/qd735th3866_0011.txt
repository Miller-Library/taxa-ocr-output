Fig. 1 —- Diagram showing location of collection sites along the south shore
of Monterey Bay in California.
Fig. 2 —- Diagram showing front and side views of set-up used.
Fig. 3 —- Plot of activity of 3 individual C. fissus, taken from the break-
water collecting site and observed in circulating water, plotted
ys. time. The tidal and diurnal cycles are included below for
visual comparison. The curved zig-zag between 5/21 and 5/26
represents a 5 day gap in the data.
Fig. 4 —- Plot of activity of 3 individual C.fissus,,taken from the RR tracks
collecting site and observed in circulating water, vs. time.
The tidal and diurnal cycles are included for visual comparison.
The curved zig-zag between 5/21 and 5/26 represents a 5 day gap in
the data.
Fig. 5 -- Plot of activity of 3 individual B. glandula, taken from the
RR tracks collecting site and observed in circulating water,
ys. time. The tidal and diurnal cycles are included for visual
comparison. The curved zig-zag between 5/21 and 5/26 represents
a 5 day gap in the data.
Fig. 6 — Plot of activity of populations of C. fissus, taken from each
collecting site and maintained in circulating water, vs. time.
The tidal and diurnal cycles are included for visual comparison.
The curved zig-zag between 5/21 and 5/26 represents a 5 day gap
in the data.
Fig. 7 -- Plot of activity of population of B. glandula, taken from RR
tracks collecting site and observed in circulating water, vs.
time. Tidal and diurnal cycles are included for visual comp¬
arison. The curved zig-zag between 5/21 and 5/26 represents a
5 day gap in the data.
