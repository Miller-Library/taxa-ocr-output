Discussion:
The BrdU-pulse ensures that the results depict a snapshot of dividing cells, so that it is
possible to draw conclusions about the nature of migration. Since all stained cells were
stained during the 5-day window of BrdU pulse, the location of the cells after a month
can be compared to the final location. All of the controls as well as experimentals display
staining in the ventricular zones, which affirms previous research. However the evidence
of outlying cells in the optic tectum suggests migration and yields new and intriguing
evidence.
The outlying cells found in the forebrain do not necessarily suggest migration from the
telencephalic ventricle, in light of the evidence discovered by Mueller and Wulliman.
because they could have originally been dividing in the forebrain. However, the evidence
of stained nuclei in the optic tectum suggests migration because the control only displays
staining in the PVZ. Therefore the stained cells in the optic tectum originated in the PYZ
and migrated outwards. This migration suggests that cells in the PVZ are progenitor cells
that are differentiating into neurons and astrocytic glia and migrating into the optic
tectum as they reach their fate.
The great variation in data over the time course from 24 hours to one month is most
likely not the result of fluctuation in the amount of proliferation, but rather the result of
inconsistent staining that prevented some of the slides from revealing useful data. This
inconsistent staining and the small sample size of the data make it difficult to draw
d√©finitive conclusions about the nature of migration from this study. Howeyer, the
evidence of outlying cells, displayed most clearly in the 18-day experimental, vields new
