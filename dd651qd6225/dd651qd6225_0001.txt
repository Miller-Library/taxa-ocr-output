Abstract:
The zebrafish Danio rerio is very useful for the study of cell proliferation in the brain.
not only because it has been entirely genetically sequenced, but also because teleosts
have remarkable abilities to regenerate parts of their central nervous system aster iniury.
In adult zebrafish, neurogenesis has been documented predominantly in the cerebellum.
and in ventricular zones, especially in the telencephalic ventricle in the forebrain.
Neurogenesis in the ventricular zones implies that the cells are turning over and
remaining progenitor cells; however this study examines whether these cells are
differentiating. Discovering a path of differentiation would lend insight into the
regulation of regeneration. This study focuses on possible migration of progenitor cells
from the periventricular zone to the optic tectum in zebrafish embryos as they develop.
using BrdU to label dividing cells and confocal microscopy to image these cells. The
results reveal a smattering of nuclei throughout the optic tectum and encephalon.
suggesting migration outward from ventricular areas.
