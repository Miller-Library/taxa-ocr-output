and intriguing evidence for the possibility of broader zones of progenitor cells than
previously thought, and should be further explored in a greater number of fish over a
longer time course. Another future direction for this experiment is to examine the fate of
these cells, to use a double-staining procedure with Hu-protein to determine if the
outlying cells are neurons or not, and determine zones of neurogenesis as opposed to
simply zones of proliferation. In conclusion, the evidence of cells found outlying from
the periventicular zone, in the optic tectum, suggests that neurogenesis is occurring in the
optic tectum, from progenitor cells in the PVZ.
