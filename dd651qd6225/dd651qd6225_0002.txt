Introduction:
The study of neurogenesis in the zebrafish brain is an exciting field due to its potential
applications for regeneration in the adult human brain, in recovery from neuroÂ¬
degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and strokes. Neurogenesis in the
adult brain has been documented in rodents, in the olfactory bulb and denate gyrus, and
in birds, reptiles, and frogs, however the study of brain cell proliferation in teleosts and
specifically zebrafish is an emerging field that holds great potential for new discovery.
Not only do teleosts have a remarkable ability to regenerate their CNS after injury, but
they also have indeterminate growth, so they have no maximum body size and are
continually generating new cells. Zebrafish are an ideal experimental model because the
zebrafish genome has been entirely sequenced, and because thousands of types of
mutants are available for study.
Generally, proliferation in teleost brains occurs in the ventricular areas and in the
cerebellum, although in the zebrafish brain in particular, neurogenesis has been
documented in the olfactory bulb (Byrd and Brunjes, 2001) and in the non-ventricular
zones of the forebrain (Mueller and Wulliman, 2002). Proliferation has also been
documented in the periventricular zone (Tulloch, 2002, Webster, 2002). However, few
studies have explored the fate of these proliferating cells in the periventricular zone. This
study focuses on the periventricular zone to determine whether cells that are proliferating
in the periventricular zone are migrating outwards into the optic tectum.
Proliferating cells in the PVZ could be simply generating cerebro-spinal fluid and
turning over. However, this study hypothesizes that some of the proliferating cells are
progenitor cells that differentiate into neurons and astrocytic glia in the optic tectum. The
