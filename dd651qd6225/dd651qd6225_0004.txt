blocking solution. The brains were incubated for 5-6 hours at room temperature. Next the
brains were rinsed in PBS-Tween and then sliced into very thin sections and mounted
onto slides in glycerol.
Confocal microscopy:
Digital images were captured of the slides using a confocal microscope. Z-series Tiff-
stack movies were compressed into extended views, which were then manually analyzed
for the presence of stained nuclei.
Results:
In the 10-day fish, the control displayed staining in the telencephalic ventricle, while
the experimental echoed this staining in the telencephalic ventricle but also revealed
outlying nuclei in the forebrain. In the tectal region, the control demonstrated staining in
the PVZ and the experimental also revealed outlying cells in the optic tectum.
In the 18-day fish, the control did not yield conclusive results in the forebrain.
however the experimental indicated several outlying nuclei throughout the forebrain. In
the tectal region, the control displayed staining in the central PVZ, whereas the
experimental displayed outlying nuclei throughout the center tectal region. The control
yielded no conclusive results in either the left or right optic tectum but the experimental
displayed unique staining with a smattering of outlying cells in the optic tectum lavers,
In the 30-day fish, the control yielded inconclusive results as did most of the
experimentat but the experimental displayed staining in the rostral ventricle with a
couple of possible outlying cells.
