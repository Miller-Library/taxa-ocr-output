results of the study show outlying cells in the tectal and telencephalic zones that imply
migration from the PVZ and therefore possible differentiation.
Materials and Methods:
BrdU Pulse:
Three pairs of size-matched juvenile zebrafish were placed in a five-day pulse of
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog that stains the nuclei of cells during the S
phase of mitosis. 24h after removal from BrdU, the three control fish were fixed. The
three experimental fish were fixed at intervals of 10 days, 18days, and 30 days after
removal from BrdU. Fixing the fish involved decapitating it and placing the head into 4%
PF overnight in the refrigerator, and then placing the head into methanol for an
indeterminate amount of time at -20 degrees F. The fish were removed from methanol
and rehydrated in 15 minute intervals of 75% methanol, 50% methanol, and 25%
methanol, and then water. The brains were then dissected out of the heads and placed in
PBS-Tween.
Immunohistochemistry:
The brains were rinsed in water several times, then rinsed in HCl several times, and
then incubated in HCl for one hour. Each rinsing involved a 15 minute soak. The brains
were then rinsed in PBS-Tween four times and rinsed in blocking solution four times, and
placed in the primary antibody, monoclonal anti-BrdU clone BU-33, in a concentration of
1:100 antibody blocking solution, and incubated overnight in the reffigerator. Asterwards.
the brains were rinsed several times in PBS-D-Tween for 15 minutes each and incubated
in goat-derived anti-mouse fluorescent secondary antibody, in a ratio of 1:500 antibody.
