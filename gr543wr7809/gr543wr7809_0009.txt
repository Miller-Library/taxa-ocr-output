This is likely, because as Dunalliela grew older, it was observed to have more
chloroplasts per plant, and these chloroplasts may eclipse each other.
Conclusion
In situ diel variations in fluorescence are primarily due to changes in phytoplankton
physiology, specifically an increased quantum yeild of photosynthesis due to increases
in PAR. An empirical correction based on this hypothesis explains half of the daily
variation in fluorescence
Absorption decreases as cultures grow older, but it does not vary enough to
affect attenuation. Attenutaion exhibits a circadian rhythm in Dunalliela but not in
Phaodactylum. By inference, scattering changes inversely to expected PAR. Thus,
cell swelling, change in refractive index or cell division might explain the change in beam
attenuation.
Chlorophyll measurements from in situ fluorescence can be more accurate by a
factor of two by using the emperical equation: corrected(f) = raw(f) +.0005* (smoothed
and shifted PAR)â€œmean(f). Further work is needed to accurately determine chlorophyl
from remote bio-optical parameters, but this relationship is likely to be refined by
correlating fluorescence, PAR, and attenuation on daily and instantaneous time scales.
When this is done, the carbon budget for open ocean water masses may be better
monitored with the aid of a fluorometer. It is also possible that attenuation and
fluorescence will be able to identify species of phytoplankton by remote techniques
