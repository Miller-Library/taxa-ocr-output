ABSTRACT
In situ instruments report a daily periodicity in fluorescence (f) and beam
attenuation (c) in the ocean. The daily changes are hypothesized to result from changes in
phytoplankton physiology. To determine the relation between f,c, chlorophyll (chl), and
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), time series measurements were made on cultures
of phytoplankton which were exposed to different light conditions. F normalized to chl
(f*) varied inversely to PAR. c* displayed daily changes that did not correlate to PAR. The
f response is well above experimental noise and its amplitude is two times as strong as the
in situ signal. The c* response is not significantly outside of the experimental error, and
it's amplitude is within the range of the in situ signal. Absorption (a) was also measured.
A* did not correlate to PAR or time, but steadily decreased as cultures grew older.
conclude c' varies due to b* (scattering per chl.) with a circadian rhythm, and f' varies in
response to PAR. This is consistent with in situ data. Further, I present what is believed to
be the first reported empirical method to measure chl from both f and PAR.
