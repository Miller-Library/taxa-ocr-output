Figure Legends:
Figure 1. Time series of surface PAR, fluorescence at 10 meters depth and transmissivity
at 10 meters from the mooring in Monterey Bay from January 16 to May 20, 1992.
Figure 2. Time series of surface PAR, fluorescence at 10 meters depth and transmissivity
at 10 meters from the mooring in Monterey Bay from May 7 to May 14, 1992.
Figure 3. Raw, mean, raw - mean, and raw/mean timeseries for fluorescence measured
by the mooring in Monterey bay from March 20 to May 5, 1992.
Flgure 4. raw/mean fluorescence vs. PAR measured by the mooring in Monterey bay
from March 20 to May 5, 1992.
Figure 5. Fluorescence vs. mean fluorescence (determined by a one day running
average). [Mean fluorescence correlates well with chlorophyll (Chavez 1991).)
Figure 6. Time series of fluorescence, chlorophyll, fluorescence normalized to
chlorophyll and PAR for Dunalliela in the sun (DS)
Figure 7. Time series of fluorescence, chlorophyll, fluorescence normalized to
chlorophyll and PAR for Phaodactylum in the sun (PS)
Figure 8. Time series of fluorescence, chlorophyll, fluorescence normalized to
chlorophyll and PAR for Dunalliela in the incubator (DI)
Figure 9. Time series of fluorescence, chlorophyll, fluorescence normalized to
chlorophyll and PAR for Phaodactylum in the incubator (PI)
