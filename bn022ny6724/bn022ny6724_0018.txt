Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 19-
When the intruder was significantly larger (at least 1.5 times) than the host.
there was a higher probability the host would lose the fight and leave. In no cases
where the host was of comparable size or larger did it leave. The host seems to have
an advantage over the intruder, and this advantage does not depend on length of
residency prior to the encounter. Length of residency varied from a few seconds to
ten minutes.
