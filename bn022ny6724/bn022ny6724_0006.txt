COWERING
From any previous position, pseudoscorpion immediately assumes the
resting/relaxed position.
THANATOSIS (fig. 2c)
Body motionless, feigning death; legs fully folded up and held together
underneath body; pedipalps drawn close to body with elbows nearly touching
dorsally; chelae closed, tips of two chelae nearly touching each other and just
anterior to the chelicerae.
Discussion. The resting positions are the usual positions G. californi√ßus
assume when not active. The resting/alert posture is used when the animals
are in an exposed position where they are not surrounded by cover in at least
two directions. The resting/relaxed posture is most frequently used when the
pseudoscorpions are well concealed or clustered with other pseudoscorpions.
When disturbed (as in lifting the cover of a petri dish), the
pseudoscorpions cower and remain motionless. If not further disturbed, they
resume activities in 1-3 minutes. When animals are greatly disturbed, they
immediately assume the thanatosis position. In this position the
pseudoscorpions are very hard to distinguish from the substrate or debris. In
1-3 minutes a pseudoscorpion slowly extends its legs and grasps the substrate if
on its stomach. If it is on its back, it quickly rights itself. In both cases,
after a few preliminary investigative movements, it quickly runs off.
Remaining motionless probably offers the pseudoscorpions protection from
predators who depend more on movement than touch or taste.
