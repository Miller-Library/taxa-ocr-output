Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 18-
interactions the host left. 37 encounters resulted in fights and 10 encounters ended
with clustering.
DISCUSSION
The initial posture of the host was an important factor in determining the
result of the interaction. If the host was in the resting/relaxed position, the intruder
clustered or was ignored a large percentage of the time , whereas if the host was in
the resting/alert posture aggressive behavior usually resulted. This supports the
belief that the resting/relaxed posture is more of a sleeping state and weak stimuli
are not sufficient to elicit any response. However in the resting/alert posture, the
pseudoscorpion is receptive to all stimuli as in the fight-or-flight response. There
were probably more aggressive interactions in the lab than in the natural habitat
because more animals were in the resting/alert state due to the absence of places for
concealment in the dish and the higher population density. But, the ratios for the
two different types of aggressive interactions are still accurate.
Th√®re is some question of whether or not pseudoscorpions show territoriality.
Many times they are found clustered closely together without apparent signs of
territoriality, yet the frequent fighting when one's area is intruded upon contradicts
this. It may be that when a pseudoscorpion is active or in the resting/alert position.
it does not let other animals in its area, but when it sleeps it does.
In those cases where threatening gestures were made, if the host was the only
one to gesture, the intruder usually left. If the intruder gestured at any time, a fight
usually ensued. It appears that the intruder takes the gesture as a challenge and
"decides" whether to fight or run away. No correlation between size and decision
was noted.
