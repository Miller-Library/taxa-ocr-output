Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus
-Page 15-
CHELA-TO-CHELA GRASE
The chela of one animal is grasped by the chela of another
pseudoscorpion.
LEG PINCH
One leg of a pseudoscorpion is grasped by the chela of another.
FIGHT
One or more chela-to-chela grasps and/or leg pinches are made between
two pseudoscorpions.
FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE
After a threatening gesture is made by one pseudoscorpion to another,
the threatened animal either runs away or stays and fights.
QUICK SPIN
Pseudoscorpion rapidly spins around to face the source of a stimulus
from the side or rear.
CHASE
One pseudoscorpion walks or runs after another while making threatening
gestures and/or leg pinches.
Discussion. Threatening gestures are used as a warning and as a challenge to
other animals who enter an area occupied by a pseudoscorpion. Gestures
pr√©cede many fights, although, rarely, gestures are made after a fight. The
chela-to-chela grasp is often the first contact of a fight. When a
pseudoscorpion's chela is grasped, it struggles violently. Once free, it may
then run away or continue fighting. An aggressing animal approaching another
from the side or rear initiates a fight by giving a leg pinch. The pinched
animal does a quick spin and a fight ensues.
