Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 5-
RESULTS
HABITAT
G. californicus can be found in a narrow band along the coastline, extending
from the higher high water mark up to several meters above the initial appearance of
vegetation. Individuals were found living under rocks or driftwood on dry or slightly
moist substrates. No specimens were found on moist or wet substrates. Substrate
size varied greatly from 0.5 mm diameter sand grains to 12 mm diameter gravel,
although organisms were most commonly found on 1-3 mm diameter sand grains. Rock
size did not appear to matter as long as the rock was not deeply buried and there was
sufficient room under the rock for movement. Organisms commonly found with
pseudoscorpions are centipedes, mites, spiders, amphipods, beetles, beetle and fly
larvae, pill bugs, collembola, and ants.
Discussion. G. californicus were always found above or right at the point of the
highest drift. The pseudoscorpions were situated where they very rarely got splashed
or submerged. (Lee, 1979), has reported they can only tolerate submergence for an
hour, but may survive longer periods if there are air bubbles to press their spiracles
against. Many females were found in brood nests. Often times spiders were found
living very close to the pseudoscorpions. The spiders also constructed nests out of
silk and gravel which were sometimes hard to distinguish from the ones made by
pseudoscorpions.
PSEUDOSCORPION ACTION PATTERNS AND POSTURES
The postures and general behavior observed in G. californicus can be divided
into solitary behavior patterns and social behavior patterns. Solitary behavior
