CHELA TO CHELICERAE TRANSFER (fig. 6b)
Object grasped by chela is brought to and grasped by chelicerae:
pedipalp chela then releases object.
FEEDING METHOD
Prey is quickly grasped and poison injected by the poison teeth at chela
fingertips; prey is either held until it stops struggling or is dropped and later
grasped by chela; prey is transferred from chela to chelicerae, which pierces
the body for reception of digestive enzymes from gut; prey is sucked dry and
either dropped to the ground or transferred to the chela and then dropped.
Fig. 4 details the poison teeth at the chelae tips.
Discussion. Pseudoscorpions often miss at their first attempted grasp at prey.
If prey is still within range, more grasps are attempted until successful of prey
is out of range. They do not chase their prey, but wait motionless until prey
approaches and then quickly grasps it. Most of the time the prey is then
dropped and ignored until the poison takes effect and prey is immobilized
before consumption. More than one prey can be killed at one sitting.
NEST BUILDING AND BROODING ACTION PATTERNS AND POSTURES
[Brood nests are built using any solid substrate for a wall. Where small
particles (such as sand or gravel) are abundant, they are used in the construction of
the other walls of the brood nest.)
BROOD NEST CONSTR UCTION
Particle to be used in construction is grasped, transferred to chelicerae.
then positioned in wall of nest and immediately glued into place by silk
extruded by spinnerets located at the ends of the moyable fingers of the
