Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus
-Page 16-
A fight between two pseudoscorpions never ends fatally. This may be
due to immunity to its own poison, or the non-injection of poison, although the
mechanism of grasping appears the same as that in feeding. After a loser
Teaves the scene of a fight, the victor sometimes gives chase, but chases are
made only for short distances.
ADULT G. CALIFORNICUS BEHAVIOR DURING ENCOUNTERS (fig. 9)
METHODS
In studying interactions between idividuals, only adult pseudoscorpions were
used. There were three parts to the experiment. In one part four females and one
male were simultaneously placed in a 60 mm petri dish lined with wet filter paper and
Ã  5 mm layer of sand grains. A second part was carried out with two females in a
dish, and the third involved one female and one male in a dish. Encounters were
either random interactions or set up by placing one individual 2-3 mm in front of
another. When one pseudoscorpion, the "intruder", moved or was placed within 3 mm
of an initially stationary "host", an encounter occurred. Data from each encounter
were recorded on a pre-designed chart which included most combinations of prior
observations. New combinations were added to the chart when they occurred. An
encounter ended when (1) one animal moved moved at least 6 mm from the point of
initial interaction, (2) both animals left, or (3) both settled down within 6 mm of each
other. Relative sizes were estimated during each encounter.
