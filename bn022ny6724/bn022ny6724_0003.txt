Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 4-
Pseudoscorpions were maintained in the laboratory in terraria (0.5-5.0 gallons).
Each terrarium contained 1-3 cm of sand, a dish filled with wet sand, and rocks,
pieces of wood, and shell for concealment. This arrangement mimicked the natural
high intertidal habitat of the pseudoscorpions. Each terrarium was covered by a fine
mesh netting to prevent escape. The animals were fed weekly with collembola
collected from the beach. For closer observations, 60 mm petri dishes were lined
with wet filter paper and a 5 mm layer of sand grains 0.7-1.0 mm in diameter.
Animals apparently in good condition (moved about and ate occasionally) were kept in
the laboratory for up to four weeks.
Observations of behavior were made both in the field and in the laboratory. In
the field, rocks in the high intertidal and supralittoral zone were overturned and
observations were recorded. The rocks were then carefully returned to their original
positions. In the laboratory, observations of the animals in the terraria and petri
dishes were made using both a hand lens and a dissecting microscope. High speed
behaviors were recorded on videotape through a dissecting a microscope, and analyzed
at slow playback speeds. A total of 26 animals was observed. In analyzing behavior,
a component was termed an action pattern if (1) it was performed by more than one
individual, (2) it was observed more than once during the study, and (3) it varied in
form about a typical or modal performance.
Methods used in studying interactions between individuals are given in the
section dealing with adult G. californicus behavior during encounters.
