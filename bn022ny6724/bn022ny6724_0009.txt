what is in front of it. In the sideways walk, the turning posture is modified so
that what is directly ahead and to the side can both be sensed.
Both the sideways and backward walk/run are seldom used except when
the animal is trying to escape. This may be because the sideways walk is an
inefficient means of locomotion and the inability to sense where it is going in
the backward walk. However, the backward walk is very quick, and is as fast
or faster than the forward run.
Usually a pseudoscorpion rights itself within seconds after falling on its
back, but after many futile tries the animal becomes exhausted and rests with
both pedipalps flexed and chelae held behind prosoma. After a short rest,
attempts to right are continued until exhaustion or animal is righted.
Frequently while walking, pseudoscorpions stop and make investigative
movements with their pedipalps. These movements probably help orient them
as course changes often follow these stops.
GROOMING ACTION PA
TTERNS AND POSTURES
IThe chelae of the pedipalps are the most important sensory organs of the
pseudoscorpion and must frequently be groomed to retain optimal functioning
(Weygoldt, 1969). The tarsi of the legs also contain many hairs and which are also
groomed, although not as frequently as the palpal fingers.)
GROOMING OF CHELAE (fig. 5a)
One finger of chela is slowly pushed, from tip to base through
chelicerae; other pedipalp is held in the resting/alert position.
