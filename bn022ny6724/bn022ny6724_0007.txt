TERNS AND POSTURES
LOCOMOTORY ACTION PA
[The method of locomotion was observed to be the same as in other eight
legged animals (Kaestner 1927
FORWARD WALK (fig. 3a)
Femurs of pedipalps extended laterally, held 80-90 degrees from main
body axis; angle of elbows 120-140 degrees; chelae open and pointing forwards;
bottoms of movable fingers of chelae are constantly bounced along substrate
when walking.
FORWARD RUN (fig. 3b)
Similar to foward walk, but with pedipalps extended farther forward;
femurs of pedipalps held 100-120 degrees from main body axis; chelae are
bounced along substrate much less frequently than in forward walk, and held
higher.
TURN (fig. 3c)
Both chelae point in direction of turn; leading pedipalp femur held 70-80
degrees from main body axis, elbow angle 160-170 degrees, chela open; trailing
pedipalp femur held 40-70 degrees from main body axis, elbow angle 80-90
degrees, wrist angle 90-100 degrees, chela closed or partially open.
SIDEWAYS WALK (fig. 3d)
Similar to turn, but with trailing chela also open and pointing forward;
femur of trailing pedipalp held parallel to prosoma; trailing pedipalp wrist angle
80-90 degrees; walking motion is similar to that of a crab.
