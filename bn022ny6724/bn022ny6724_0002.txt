Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 3-
INTRODUCTION
Garypus californicus Banks, 1909, is a 4-5 mm long pseudoscorpion that occurs
along the coastline from Trinidad, California, to Isla Asuncion and Isla de Guadalupe,
Baja California (Lee, 1979). It has also been reported in the Pomona-Laguna,
California area (Moore, 1917), from San Nicolas Island, California (Cockerell, 1940),
and from Palo Alto, California (Banks, 1909). The geographical distribution of the
animals appears to have been governed by the oceanic currents of the Pacific Ocean
due to the use of rafting as a means of dispersal (Lee, 1979). It is a nocturnal animal
that constructs nests for brooding, hibernation, and molting (Weygoldt, 1969). Little
else is known about G. californicus.
Although many studies have been made on the complex mating behaviors
exhibited by pseudoscorpions, very few general behavioral studies have been made, and
none on this species. In the present study an attempt was made to analyze the
behavior of G. californicus into simple components that could be described, figured,
and later treated as sequences of postures and actions during the recording of such
activities as nest building, brooding, feeding, and fighting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens were collected at various points along the high intertidal zone at
Mussel Point and Asilomar Beach State Park, Pacific Grove, California, during the day
and early evening between 19 April and 13 May, 1982. Organisms were captured and
placed in small bottles for later laboratory analyses. Studies were carried out at the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California.
