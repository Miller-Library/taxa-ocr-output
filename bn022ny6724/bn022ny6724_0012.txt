surrounding the chelicerae.
SILK EXTRUSION RELATED MOVEMENTS
When silk is exuded, movements of the prosoma facilitate aiming of silk
application.
LAYING OF EGGS AND FORMING OF BROOD SAC
Not observed in the lab.
BROODING POSITION
Brood sac with eggs remains attached to genital pore; legs grasp the side
or top of brood nest; pedipalps positioned as in resting/relaxed posture.
Discussion. Brood nests are built one layer at a time, like an igloo. At least
one side of the nest is solid, usually the bottom of the rock. The other sides
are constructed by gluing one particle into place at a time and then building
over it. This continues until the pseudoscorpion is completely enclosed. The
actual construction takes from 1-2 days, followed by 1-2 days of lining the
walls with silk. In the lab a pseudoscorpion was observed to line a structure
consisting of two well-slides placed face to face with silk and form a brood
nest.
After the lining the walls, the female grasps the side or the top of the
nest, and about 2 days later forms a brood sac filled with 16-25 eggs. The
female feeds the eggs nutritive fluids from her body and the eggs grow
(Weygoldt, 1969). The female does not eat or move while brooding except
when the enlargement of the eggs forces her to change positions. If disturbed
while brooding, female either repairs small holes, or drops her brood sac, leaves
the nest, and runs away.
