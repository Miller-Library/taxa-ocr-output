Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus
-Page 17-
RESULTS
This experiment was performed to test general social behaviors during
encounters, and differences between male and female interactions. The first
experiment involving four females and one male had a total of 76 encounters. The
second involved two females and 20 encounters, and the third involved one male and
one female with 20 encounters. No significant difference was noted between
male/female interactions and female/female interactions. For this reason all further
numbers refer to the combined total of 116 encounters.
Following the initial placement or entry of an intruder, one of four events
occurred. (1) In 32 trials the intruder was ignored, and in 25 of those the intruder
left. In five others the intruder walked over the host and left, but in two cases a
fight resulted after the intruder walked on the host, and in both cases the intruder
left after the fight. (2) In 34 trials the first action made was either a chela-to-chela
grasp or a leg pinch, (3) In 46 trials a threatening gesture was made by one or both
animals. (4) In the remaining 4 trials the intruder and host clustered together.
Where the first action was a grasp, twice as many first grasps were done by
the host than the intruder. In 21 cases the first grasp resulted in the intruder
leaving, while the other 13 resulted in a fight. All but two of the intruders left
after the fight.
In most of the encounters which began with a gesture, the host gestured and
the intruder followed suit. In 22 cases the intruder left after the gestures, but in
another 22 a fight resulted. After the fight, the intruder left 15 of the times, while
the host left 4 times, and both clustered another 4 times (numbers do not add up
because "both leave" is counted twice).
101 out of the 116 encounters ended with intruder leaving, while in only 11
