Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 14-
SOCIAL BEHAVIORS
lOnly thise actions and postures which differ from previously mentioned ones
are included in this section. Mating, caring of the young, and behavior between
juveniles were not seen.)
NON-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS BETWEEN ADULTS
WALKOVER
One pseudoscorpion walks over the back of another.
CLUSTER
One pseudoscorpion settles down beside another and assumes one of the
resting positions.
Discussion. The walkover most frequently takes place when the psedoscorpion
being walked on is in the resting/relaxed position. If it occurs in any other
position, aggressive behavior usually follows. Pseudoscorpions are often found
clustering together in groups of two or more. This may have some survival
value.
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS BETWEEN ADULTS
THREATENING GESTURE (fig. 8)
The pedipalps, initially in the resting/alert position, are rapidly extended
anterior to the prosoma so the open chelae almost touch each other; pedipalps
very rapidly return to the resting/alert position; motion may be repeated many
times.
