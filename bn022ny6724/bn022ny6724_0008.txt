Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garvpus
-Page 9-
BACKWARD RUN/WALK (fig. 3e)
Femurs of pedipalps held against side of body; angle of elbows 70-100
degrees; chelae closed.
RIGHTING RESPONSE (figs. 3f and 3g)
Starting with pseudoscorpion lying on its back; legs are kicked actively;
if they contact any surface, it is grasped and the animal rights itself; failing
this, one pedipalp is extended anteriorly and the closed chela is pushed against
substrate; at the same time the back is arched, lifting prosoma above substrate:
opposite pedipalp is used as counterbalance and is pushed off the substrate
dorsal to the prosoma and thrown anteriorly and laterally to bring the animal to
its stomach; if unsuccessful, process is repeated alternating pedipalp functions
until righted.
INVESTIGATIVE MOVEMENTS
After stopping locomotion, pedipalps are moved anteriorly, posteriorly,
laterally, and dorsally; open chelae are touched to nearby objects and
substrate.
Discussion. During forward walking, the constant bouncing of the chelae on
the substrate allow the pseudoscorpion to judge its surroundings. Fig. 4 shows
the many sensory hairs on the pedipalp chelae. When walking alongside a large
object, the inside pedipalp is bounced on the side of the object as the other
pedipalp bounces on the substrate. The position of the pedipalps in the
forward walk facilitates the quickest forward motion while still sensing what
lies directly ahead.
By pointing both chelae in the direction of motion in the turn, the
pseudoscorpion can both have a clearer view and use its pedipalps to sense
