Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus
-Page 11-
GROOMING OF LEGS (figs. 5a and 5b)
Body is braced against immovable object; one pedipalp is held in
resting/alert position while other is used to hold body above substrate; all four
Tegs on the side of the bracing pedipalp are lifted off the substrate and the
tarsi rubbed against each other.
Discussion. The grooming of the chelicerae is always done by first grooming
the fixed finger of one chela, then the movable finger of the same chela. The
other chela is then groomed, fixed finger before movable. If interrupted
before completion of the actions, the next time grooming is attempted, the
process is repeated in totality.
The hairs on the legs are probably sensory, but aren't as important as
those on the chelae. During grooming of the legs, the tarsi are rubbed
together for 10-30 seconds, after which the animal may walk off or groom the
legs on the other side.
FEEDING ACTION PATTERNS AND POSTURES
The pseudoscorpion feeds on small soft-bodied arthropods such as flies.
collembola, beetle larvae, and adult beach-flies emerging from puparia (Evans, 1980).
and has also been seen preying on hard-bodied arthropods (Lee, 1979). In the
Taboratory the pseudoscorpion was observed eating collembola and small spiders.
GRASP (fig. 6a)
May involve one or both chelae; grasped object is held between movable
and fixed fingers of chela.
