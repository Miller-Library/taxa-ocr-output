The general behavior of the supralittoral pseudoscorpion Garypus californicus
was studied along the shoreline of Pacific Grove, California, where it is commonly
found. Behavior, observed in the field and the lab, was analyzed and broken into
components which were deseribed and figured. The components were divided into
solitary and social behaviors, which were further divided into more specific categories
containing specific actions and postures. 116 encounters between adult organisms
were analyzed and treated as sequences of behaviors. An "intruder" either randomly
entered or was placed in the area of an initially stationary "host". Threatening
gestures made by the two participants usually resulted in one organism leaving or a
fight. In 101 cases the end result was the intruder leaving. Significant amounts of
clustering behavior were found and correlate well with the initial posture of the host.
