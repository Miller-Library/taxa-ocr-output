Lum: Behavior in the Pseudoscorpion Garypus -Page 6-
patterns include non-locomotory action activities and postures, locomotory actions,
grooming actions, feeding actions, nest building actions, and brooding actions and
postures. Social behavior patterns include action patterns between adult
pseudoscorpions, action patterns between juvenile animals, and action patterns
associated with brooding and care of the young. Mating behavior was not seen.
Many postures can be distinguished by the position and behavior of the
pedipalps. In the descriptive nomenclature used, the word "chelae" refers to the
pedipalp chelae, not chelicerae. The "wrist angle" is the angle formed by the
pedipalp tibia and tarsus (fig. 1). The "elbow angle" is the angle formed by the
pedipalp femur and tibia (fig. 1). The angle of the palpal femur to the main body axis
is also shown in fig. 1.
SOLITARY BEHAVIORS
NON-LOCOMOTORY ACTION PATTERNS AND POSTURES
[Legs are extended essentially as in fig. 2 unless otherwise noted)
RESTING/RELAXED (fig. 2a)
Femurs of pedipalps drawn in toward body, bringing elbows above
opisthosoma; angle of elbows 30 degrees; chelae closed, tips nearly touching
each other.
RESTING/ALERT (fig. 2b)
Femurs of pedipalps nearly parallel to prosoma, with femurs held at an
angle of 0-20 degrees to main body axis; angle of elbows 100-120 degrees;
chelae open.
