Genbank database with the FASTA algorithm were then used to locate homologous
sequences.

Plating experiments:
Isolation of colonies from egg sheath tissue
Bactena were isolated from 15 section of egg sheath in 4 trials as described in the
Materials and Methods (Table 1). Three distinet bacterial morphologies were isolated from
the 15 egg sheaths examined. Based upon their color they were labeled brown-orange
(BO), orange-green (OG), and white (W). The BO and Wisolates were present in cultures
from each of the 15 sheaths. The OG isolate was found in 7 of the 15 sheaths. The number
of colonies formed per gram of egg sheath tissue (cfu/g) for each of the 15 sheaths
examined are presented in Table 2. The cfu present on the marine agar decreased linearl
with the amount of time the sections of sheath were immersed in ethanol (Figure 1.) The
decrease in cfu per minute of EtOH treatment is present between the BO and Wisolates
from all the sheaths examined, indicating that the two morphologies' relative frequency is
maintained upon exposure to ethanol. A similar plot of cfulg formed vs. ethanol time
treatment was generated for sheaths (J3, J5-J10) which included the OG isolate (Figure
2).
Protease Activity Assay. H.S Production Assay, Antifungal Assay:
The BO and OG isolates were shown to express protease activity against the protein
casein as indicated by a zone of clearing around the isolate after several days of growth on a
marine agar plate containing skim milk (Figure 3a). The BO and OG isolates were both
found to produce hydrogen sulfide. as evidenced by a black precipitate of iron sulfide on
marine triple-sugar-iron-agar plates (Figure 3b).The Wisolates do not express protease
activity nor did they indicate production of hydrogen sulfide. The BO isolates have also
