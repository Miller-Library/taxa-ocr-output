After several days of growth. the plates were observed for zones of clearing in the bacterial
lawn around the antibiotic disks. A zone of clearing would imply that the bacteria had been
prevented from growing in that region due to its sensitivity to the antibiotic.
Microscopic Morphology and Metabolic fingerprinting
Electron microscopy:
Isolates from the egg sheath in log and in stationary phase were examined by
electron microscopy to observe possible differences in morphology. Cells were applied to
an EM grid by floating the grid for 2 minutes on a lOOul drop of log phase culture or
overnight culture. The cells were fixed onto the grid. and negatively stained with a 2 minute
treatment with 1% phosphotungstic acid.
Biolog Identification Kit:
Potential identities for the egg sheath isolates were examined using the BIOLOG
assay and computer program which compared the metabolic fingerprint of each isolate,
against the charactenstic metabolic fingerprints of other bacteria in the Biolog database
