water. For each trial a no DNA control was included. The samples were placed on a Perkin

When the reaction ended the products were visualized via agarose gel electrophoresis,
Banding patters were compared by calculating a ratio of similarity for pair-wise
comparisons of isolates the formula for which is:
ratio of - number of common bands
similarity
total number of bands
Whole cell hybridisation
Ribosomal DNA probes were used to determine whether probes designed
specifically for the AN gland symbiont would hybridize to the egg sheath isolates.
Bacterial cells were harvested from Iml of log phase cultures of three morphologically
different egg sheath isolates, and two control strains. The harvested cells were washed in
cold sterile seawater and then resuspended in Iml cold sterile seawater. This resuspension
was added to Iml of 8% paraformaldehyde fixative (Ag paraformaldehyde flakes, Smls
IOXPBS. 45mls ddH,O) and fixed for 1 hour. After 1 hour the cells were pelleted from the
fixative, washed in sterile seawater, and resuspended in cold sterile seawater. 3Oul of the
fixed cells were applied to slides coated with gelatin and chrome alum CrK(SO.), The
slides were allowed to air dry. and then were post-fixed for 20 minutes in a solution of
3Omls 37% formaldehyde and 270mls MeOH. After the post-fixation the slides were
rinsed briefly in water and dried in the dark.
20ul of pre-warmed hybridization buffer (lOmls 25xSET. S00ul 10%SDS.
39.5mss dH. O)was added to the prepared cells on each slide and lul of the probe
