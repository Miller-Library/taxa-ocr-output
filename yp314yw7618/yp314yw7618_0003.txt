Materials and Methods
Plating experiments:
Isolation of colonies:
Freshly spawned egg cases from Loligo opalescens Berry were collected from the
squid culture facility at Hopkins Marine Station. The egg cases were immersed in 95%
ethanol for 2 minutes to remove any exogenous bacteria on their surfaces, then rinsed twice
in sterile seawater. A section of the sheath, approximately lemâ€™, was cut from each of the
egg cases and its mass was recorded. Each section was subjected to one of the following
additional ethanol treatments: O. 2. 4,6, and 8 minutes to sterilize the outer lavers of the
egg sheath section (Table 1). After the second immersion in ethanol, the sections were
again rinsed twice in sterile seawater.
Next, each section was homogenized in ImL of sterile seawater with a sterile
dounce and the homogenate was diluted to concentrations of 10', 10, 103, 10 and 105.
100uL of the homogenate and each of the dilutions, was plated onto marine agar and
allowed to incubate for I to 2 days. After the bacterial colonies had developed on the
plates, the colonies formed per gram of sheath tissue (cfulg) was determined by counting
the number of morphologically identical colonies observed on the plate. multiplied by the
reciprocal of the original homogenate 's dilution, and then divided by the mass of the
section from which the homogenate had been made.
Colonies of different morphologies were purified by removing the desired colony
trom the sheath tissue cultures on a sterile inoculation loop and then re-streaking the colony
across a fresh. sterile. marine agar plate.
Protease Activity Assar:
Each of the morphologically different sheath isolates was patched onto replicate
marine agar plates containing ISce skim milk and allowed to grow at 1S Cor at room
temperature. It was obser ed whether the isolate expressed protease activity by
