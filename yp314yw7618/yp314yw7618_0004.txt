determining whether a zone of clearing formed around the isolate in the agar plate.
indicating the proteolytic degradation of the protein casein contained in the milk.
H.S Production Assay:
Each of the morphologically different sheath isolates was patched onto replicate
Marine triple-sugar-iron (TSI) plates and allowed to grow at 15°C or at room temperature.
Isolates were positive for the production of H,S if a black precipitate of iron sulfide formed
on the plate within the patch of bacteria.
Antifungal Assay:
Top agar plates containing the yeast against which the antifungal activity would be
tested were made by making overnight cultures the yeast (l colony of the yeast grown
overnight in SmL of marine broth) and adding lul, lOul, 5Oul or 10Oul of the overnight
culture to Aml of 1% molten top agar. This mixture was vortexed briefly and immediately
poured onto à manine agar plate, forming a top layer of agar containing the yeast. The tor
agar was allowed to cool, then each of the morphologically different sheath isolates was
patched onto the plate. After several days of growth it was determined whether the sheath
isolate exhibited antifungal activity by observing a zone of clearing in the lawn of veast
around the isolate.
Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay:
lop agar plates containing the sheath isolate whose antibiotic sensitivity would be
tested were made by making ovemnight cultures of the isolate (I colony of the isolate grown
overnight in Sml of marine broth) and adding 25ul of the culture to dml of 1% melted tot
agar. This mixture was vortexed and immediately poured onto a sterile. marine agar plate.
wo such plates were made for each isolate. Upon cooling. twenty disks containing the
following antibiotics were placed upon the two top agar plates made for each isolate (IO per
plate):
