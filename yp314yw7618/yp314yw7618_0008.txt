(SOng/ ul) was added to the buffer. Four different probe treatments were applied to each
group of cells. A eubacterial probe (EUB) as a positive control was used to label all
isolates at a conserved region in the 16S FDNA gene. A probe specific to Shewanella
putrefaciencs (SPN) was used as a negative control to show that the hybridization reaction
was specific on the species level and not across the genus Shewanella. A probe designed
to label the AN gland symbiont (SQ26) which would hybridize along the same variable
region of the l6s gene as the SPN probe. And a control hybridization, which contained no
probe, was also performed with each group of cells. The cells on the slide were covered
with à small square of parasilm and were placed in a SOml Falcon tube containing a
kimwipe saturated in hybridization buffer to incubate overnight at 50C. After the
incubation the cells were washed twice in. 2X SET then were observed for probe binding
under phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy
l6s Ribosomal DNA Amplification and Sequencing
los ribosomal DNA was amplified from the genomic DNA prepared from four of
the egg sheath isolates using Perkin Elmer Gene AMP PCR Core Reagents and two
primers which hybridized at opposite ends of the l6s gene. The amplification was
achieved via PCR with the following reaction profile:
CX 3 min
95°Cx30 sec
SSCX30 sec
28 cycles
CxI min¬
Verification that the l6s Ribosomal DNA gene had been amplified was achieved by
observing a 1500bp band after gel electrophoresis of the product.
The amplified 16S FDNA was purified with the Promega Wizard PCR Preps DNA
purification system. The purified product was sent to the Stanford University Protein and
Nucleic Acid facility for nucleotide sequencing. The sequences were analy zed for
homology to the previous AN gland isolate with the program BESTHT. Searches of the
