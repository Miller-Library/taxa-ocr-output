been shown to express antifungal activity by preventing the growth of the marine veast
Rhodotorula glutinis, and Candidatropicalis on marine agar plates (Table 3).
Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay.
The three isolates were tested for their sensitivity to twenty antibiotics which
targeted a wide range of cellular activities such as cell wall formation and protein synthesis
(Table 4). The BO, and OG isolates shared a90% identical pattern of antibiotic
resistance and sensitivity. The W bacteria showed sensitivity to all the antibiotics tested.
The three isolates shared sensitivities to thirteen out of the twenty antibiotics tested.
Morphological characterisation and metabolic fingerprinting
Electron microscopy,
Each of the isolates were examined via electron microscopy. The BO and QG
isolates appeared to have identical morphologies. Both isolates were rod shaped with
unsheathed polar flagella. The Wisolates were morphologically different than the BO and
CG isolates. The Wisolates were smaller, shorter rods with a single appendage (the E
pilus) emanating from the side of the cell. (Figure 4).
Biolog Assay:
The BIOLOG identification assay indicated that the BO and OG isolates were of the
genus Shewanella, and were closely related to the species Shewanella putrefaciens (Table
5). The system was unable to indicate any close relatives of the Wisolate,

fingerprints among the Wegg sheath isolates and previous WAN gland isolates (Figure
5). The fingerprints of the OG isolates were shown to consistently differ from the BO
isolates. indicating genomic differences between the two similar morphologies. The ratios
