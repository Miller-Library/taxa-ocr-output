were of the same newly identified species as isolates from the AN gland. Diversity within
this species was indicated by the presence of a morphologically different strain in 7 out of
the 15 egg sheaths examined, indicating possible competition between strains for
colonization of the gland, analogous to the competition observed in the light organ of E.
scolopes. These sheath isolates were shown to express potentially symbiotic activities such
as the production of hydrogen sulfide, protease activity and antifungal activity. Also
indicated was the presence of a second previously unidentified symbiont of the AN gland
and egg sheaths, which appears be vertically transmitted as well.

Iwould like to thank Melissa Kaufman for her guidance, generosity and patience in
teaching me everything I needed to know for this project. Thanks also to Professor Epel,
and his lab. Nancy, Beth and Lisa. for making me feel so welcome this quarter.
