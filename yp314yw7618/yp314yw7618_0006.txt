Molecular Studies
Isolation of genomic DNA:
The genomic DNA was extracted from several isolates of each morphology found
in the egg sheath, including purified colonies of bacteria previously isolated from the AN
gland, from purified colonies previously isolated from the egg sheath, and from several
control strains of bacteria. The genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using the Rapid Prep
Micro Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). This kit employs the use of
individual premanufactured resin-packed columns to purify the DNA from 2x 10
microbial cells (approximately Iml of an overnight culture), and then the DNA is eluted in
400ul of buffer. The DNA is then precipitated from this suspension with the addition of
320ul of isopropanol and collected by centrifugation. After use of the RapidPrep kit the
gDNA pellet from each sample was re-suspended in 30ul of ddH.O and was stored at 4°C.
RAPD PCR Analvsis:
The genomic differences between the previously isolated AN gland symbionts.
previously isolated egg sheath bacteria, and the new egg sheath isolates were investigated
using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD). This technique detects
genomic polymorphisms by using short oligonucleotide primers (7 to 15 bp) of random
sequence to initiate the polymerase chain reaction. generating a fingerprint of amplification
products specific to the species and/or strain level in question.
Ready to Go RAPD Analysis Beads (Pharmacia Biotech) were used to implement
the RAPD Analysis. These beads contained all the reagents. excluding the primer.
