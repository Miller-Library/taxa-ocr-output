post heat shock current trace. This implies that there exists a slow inactivating channel
that is recruited more strongly as time post heat shock increases. Fig. 9 shows the
increase in current with time. The subtraction of the initial current from the post heat
shock current appears to have its own set of kinetics of activation and inactivation. This
implies that there are two channels: one fast inactivating channel that does not change
with heat shock and one slow inactivating channel that is recruited more readily post heat
shock.
Two hypotheses can describe this occurrence: the number of slow-inactivating
channels in the cell membrane is increasing or the slow inactivating channels are pre-
existing in the membrane and are only getting recruited post heat shock. Both hypotheses
are certainly possible mechanisms to describe this occurrence.
When taking into consideration the first hypothesis, one can imagine that there are
intracellular vesicles that contain the slow inactivating channels. When heat shock is
induced, the vesicles travel along the microtubule array and deploy the silent channels
into the cell membrane. This mechanism would be similar to the one proposed by
Brismar and Gilly (1987) in their description of sodium channel synthesis in the squid
giant axon. Such a mechanism might account for the observed result within a one hour
time scale. Inhibition of the microtubule array with colchicine would be a good way to
test for such a mechanism.
Looking at the second hypothesis, it is possible that the channels are being
expressed the entire time in the cell membrane and only post heat shock are they
recruited. Thompson (1994) describes a calcium-dependent potassium current in
Doriopsilla. Such a current could be recruited if the internal calcium concentration
