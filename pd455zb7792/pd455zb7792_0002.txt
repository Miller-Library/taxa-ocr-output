Introduction
The effect of heat shock has been shown to have lasting effects within the cells of
organisms across species. For poikilothermic organisms, this is of particular significance
as their body temperatures are dictated by daily vacillating ambient temperature. Most
research on heat shock has focused on the expression and distribution of heat shock
proteins and how that expression and distribution affects cellular function. Oddly
enough, the effect of heat shock in relationship to the nervous system has only recently
been explored (Ramierez et al 1999). In particular, the effect of heat shock on the
mechanisms of neural exitability is yet to be uncovered.
In light of this, I examined the effect of heat shock on Doriopsilla albopunctata, a
low intertidal poikilotherm. Due to its fluctuating temperature environment and large
head ganglia, this animal was ideal for studying the effect of heat shock on neurological
function.
To examine the effect of heat shock on the head ganglia of Doriopsilla, I created a
protocol that allowed for constant dual electrode voltage clamp recording pre and post
heat shock without ever removing the electrodes from the cell. Here I report an increase
in potassium conductance post heat shock due to the recruitment of a slow inactivating
channel. The expression of the channel increased with increasing time post heat shock.
This effect, however, was not observed in all cells.
Methods
Specimens were collected from Monterey Bay and kept in a tank at Hopkins
Marine Station. Each Doriopsilla was dissected and its head ganglia excised. The
