By looking more closely at the top current trace from the 1.5 hour stimulation
regime, it appears that the trace is comprised of two decaying logarithmic functions. This
is highlighted in Fig. 7. The linear approximation of the natural log of the current from
that trace is shown in Fig. 8.
In order to better analyze the data, I took the top current trace (-20mV
depolarizing step) from each time interval post heat shock (30min, lhour, and 1.5 hour)
and subtracted out the top current trace from the pre heat shock regime. The difference
of those traces is shown in Fig. 9. This difference in current shows the component that is
effected by the heat shock.
Discussion
These results show a large increase in potassium conductance post heat shock.
Moreover, conductance increases with time post heat shock. This implies a cellular
mechanism that not only responds to heat shock, but also responds on a very short time
scale (within one hour after the onset of heat shock). What mechanism is responsible for
this change is difficult to extrapolate from the given experiments. However, closer
analysis of the data gives insight into what may be happening.
As Fig. 7 shows, it appears that two exponentially decaying functions comprise
the current trace 1.5 hours post heat shock. Since inactivation can be described
exponentially, it appears that two different rates of inactivation are present. In order to
prove this, Fig. 8 shows the linear approximations of the log of current with respect to
time. There appears to be two separate straight lines that can describe the semi-log plot.
This demonstrates that there are two exponentially decaying functions that comprise the
