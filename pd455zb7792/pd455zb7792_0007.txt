changes post heat shock. Since calcium is such a ubiquitous cellular agent and so many
proteins are responsible for changing the calcium concentration within a cell, it would be
difficult to isolate precisely what mechanism is changing to allow for such a vacillation in
calcium concentration. However, it would interesting to pursue this possibility if this
same experiment were run in the presence of fura-2 in order to ascertain accurately how
much the internal calcium concentration vacillates post heat shock.
The possibility of heat shock proteins playing a role in this mechanism or simply
novel protein translation should be considered. Although hsp's play a role in many
cellular processes, it seems unlikely that they would have any appreciable affect on ion
channels directly or any integral membrane protein for that matter. Hsp90 may have
some significance in the second hypothesis as it has been shown to have significance in
signal transduction (Bratt and Toft), although its function remains dubious at best. Also,
it is not known if Doriopsilla translates hsp’s in response to a thirty-minute 30°C heat
shock. Finally, novel protein synthesis does not seem realistic on the time scale
observed, although it would be interesting to inhibit protein synthesis and run the same
experiment.
Although there are many questions left unanswered, the observed result is
compelling. I show that a novel current is recruited post heat shock and increases in
amplitude with increasing time post heat shock. The observed effect is also cell specific
as some cells exhibit no appreciable change in current in response to heat shock. In order
to determine the cellular mechanism for this change, many more experiments must be run
and more rigorous stimulation regimes instigated. The data mandate experimentation to
characterize this novel change in neurological function in response to heat shock.
