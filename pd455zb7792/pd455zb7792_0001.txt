Abstract
The opening and closing of ion channels in the membrane of a neuron allows for
the flow of specific ions into and out of the cell. The flow of ions through membrane
channels creates current and this changes the voltage across the cell membrane. These
changes in voltage create the action potentials responsible for the propagation of neural
signals. If the number of ion channels changes or the kinetics of individual channels
change, the currents through the membrane will be altered and hence change the
excitability of the cell. Here I report changes in potassium conductance in the neurons of
Doriopsilla albopunctata after treatment and recovery from a thirty-minute heat shock at
30Â°C. By using a voltage clamp, currents of individual cells were characterized. The
cells were heat shocked and characterized again using the same stimulation regime.
Significant increases in potassium conductance were observed within many, although not
all, cells. In such cases, a novel current was found to be responsible for the change in
potassium conductance. I conclude that heat shock affects either the expression of novel
channels in the cell membrane or the kinetics of pre-existing channels, but only in some
neurons. What cellular mechanism is responsible for this change and what specifically it
changes, remains to be seen.
