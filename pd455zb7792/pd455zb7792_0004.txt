Results
Single cell voltage clamp recordings using a holding potential of -80mV were
used to examine potassium current. 400ms, SmV voltage steps used to stimulate from
-40mV to -20mV revealed large increases in peak outward current amplitude as well as
steady state current amplitude post heat shock. This increase was correlated with time
post heat shock (Fig. 1). At 30 minutes post heat shock, peak amplitude had increased
22.3% (.435 nA to .535nA) and steady state amplitude increased 37.5% (.04 to .055) after
a 400ms depolarizing voltage step at -20mV was applied. At 1.5 hours post heat shock,
peak amplitude had increased 90.8% (from .435 nA to .83nA) and the steady state had
increased 1000% (.04nA to 4nA) when exposed to the same stimulus. This change is
reflected in the potassium IV curve in Fig. 2. A GV curve was constructed (Fig. 3) using
data from a second stimulation protocol that determined the instantaneous reversal
potential of potassium by holding the cell at -80mV, stepping to -10mV for 25 ms and
stepping down to-60mV in 10mV increments for 100ms. This result showed an increase
in conductance post heat shock. Similar changes in potassium conductance were
observed in three other cells (data not shown).
A control was run in order to qualify this result. A single cell was run through the
same heat shock protocol with a slightly augmented stimulation protocol (holding
potential of-80mV with voltage steps from -40mV to OmV with a delta of 10mV (Fig.
4)) and the same reversal potential protocol. The IV for the control is shown in Fig. 5.
There was no appreciable change in peak amplitude while a mild change in steady state
was observed. The GV for the control is shown in Fig. 6.
