Figure 1: Four current traces taken pre heat shock, 30 minutes post heat shock, one hour
post heat shock, and 1.5 hours post heat shock. Current traces are in response to a -80mV
holding potential with 400ms voltage steps from —40mV to -20mV with a delta of 5mV.
Figure 2: Potassium IV curves taken from the current traces in Fig. 1
Figure 3: Potassium GV curves taken from current traces from the reversal potential
protocol.
Figure 4: Four current traces taken pre heat shock, 30 minutes post heat shock, one hour
post heat shock, and 1.5 hours post heat shock. Current traces are in response to a -80mV
holding potential with 400ms voltage steps between —40mV and OmV with a delta of
1OmV.
Figure 5: Potassium IV curves taken from the current traces in Fig. 3
Figure 6: Potassium GV curves taken from the current traces from the reversal potential
protocol
Figure 7: Current trace from 1.5 hours post heat shock in response to a -20mV 400ms
depolarizing step from a holding potential of -80mV.
