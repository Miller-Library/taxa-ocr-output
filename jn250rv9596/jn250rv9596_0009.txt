chromatophore stages.  resecata appears to be able to disperse
or concentrate chromatophore pigments with equal speed.
Effect of constant illumination on rate of background adaptation
The diurnal rhythm leading to dispersion of chromatophore
pigments during the day appears to be a mechanism which maintains
body pigmentation in a state so that the animal is at least partially
protectively colored at any given time. The preceeding experiment
indicates that 1. resecata can disperse or contract pigments of
its chromatophores equal speed. A partial dispersion of chromatoÂ¬
phore pigments during the day, regardless of whether the animal
is exposed to daylight or not prepares the animal should it
suddenly come our from a dark hiding place into the light, by
reducing the amount of dispersion or contraction of chromatophores
which might be necessary. A sample of 75 1. resecata at 1600 hours
yielded a mean rating of 3.06 with a standard deviation of 1.
These isopods were taken directly from the field and rated as
quickly as possible. The question might also be asked, what is
the advantage of concentrating pigment in chromatophores to a
fully punctate state at night? There seems no obvious advantage
from the stand point of protective coloration. Perhaps a daily
movement of chromatophore pigments to the punctate stae is necessary
in order to maintain an optimal rate of adaptation, i.e. perhaps
chromatophores "need exercise" to keep in good condition. This
hypothesis was tested in a preliminary way by placing 15 animals
in a shallow black pan and another 15 animals in a white pan and
