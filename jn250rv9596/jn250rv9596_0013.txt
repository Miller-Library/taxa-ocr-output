Chromatophore Behavior in 1 resecata. p. 15.
Fig. 3b. The diurnal cycle of chromatophore change in L resecata
kept in constant darkness and examined only at 1200 and 2400 hours,
Mean chromatophore ratins and 95% confidence levels for the
mean are shown. N=36.
Fig. 4. Diel cycle of chromatohpore change in 8 individual 1.
resecata atter being kept in constant darkness for 19 days (fig. 3b).
Fig. 5. Diel chromatophore rhythms of 5 1. resecata after 9
days in constant darkness withou observation. Isopods were
kept in individual dishes. Cycles are clearly asynchronous.
Fig. 6a. Chromatophore rating of individual 1. resecata kept in
a normal day/night light regime on a black background. Size
of rectangle is proportional to number of individuals.
Fig. 6b. Chromatophore ratings of 14 1 resecata in constant
darkness for 9 days kept in separate containers. Size of rectangle
is proportional to number of individuals; scatter of readings
indicates degree of asynchrony.
Fig. 7. Chromatophore ratings for 1 resecata after ! hour of
illumination at a particular light intensity on a black back-
ground. Animals were dark adapted for 4 hours prior to testing
All tests were conducted between 2200 and 0200 hours so chromatoÂ¬
phores of all animals were at stage I at the start of the
experiment. Mean chromatophore ratings and 95% confidence leyels
