exposing them to a constant illumination of 40 ft-c. for the
entire experiment. No food was placed in the pans and the water
was changed at approximately 8 hour intervals. Temperature in the
pans ranged 14-17 C. Isopods were maintained on their respective
backgrounds for 48 hours, after which time their chromatophores
were rated and their backgrounds switched. Animals were observed
at 15 minute intervals thereafter. Backgrounds were switched
when two successive ratings were the same, which was at O. 90.
and 120 minutes. The experiments was repeated a second time
so that each line in figure 8c represents 30 animals. It appears
that chromatophore contraction in animals going from a black to a
white background after 48 hours of constant illumination procedes
rather more slowly than is normal. Subsequent reswitching from
a black to white backgrounds at 120 minutes resulted in a normal
rate of pigment concentration, and adaptation was essentially
completed within fifteen minutes. These results while not conclusive
suggest the possibility that a secondary function of the diurnal
rhythm of chromatophores is related to a need for daily contraction
or "exercise". Alternatively the results might be explained by
the possible effects of constant illumination on the isopod eye.
Animals illuminated on the white background for 48 hours did not
adapt significantly more slowly to a black background than did
the animals in previous experiments.
Summar
1. Chromatophore pigments in the isopod Idotea resecata are
dispersed during the day and punctate at night under normal day/night
light condition, in constant darkness, and in constant low intensity
