Chromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p.
Introduction
The alteration of body color in an isopod through the concentration
and dispersal of pigments in chromatophores was first seen in
Idotea tricuspidata by Matzdorff (1883). Menke (1914) later found
this species to exhibit a diurnal rhythm of color change, the chroÂ¬
matophore pigments being dispersed during the day and punctate at
night. Oguro (1959) demonstrated a persistent diurnal rhythm in
chromatophores in the high intertidal species Idotea japonica held
in constant darkness. The present study was undertaken to determine
the behavior of chromatophores of a subtidal isopod, Idotea resecata,
under different conditions of illumination and background coloration.
Idotea resecata occurs in two color varieties, green and brown
(lee and Gilchrist 1972). Only the brown form, which occurs
exclusively on the brown alga Macrocystis, was used. Animals were
collected from the kelp beds off Mussel Point in Monterey Bay,
California, and maintained until used on the kelp Macrocystis in
large outdoor tanks at the Hopkins Marine Station. The brown
chromatophores of the dorsal side of the pleotelson are easily seen
with the aid of a dissecting microscope, and were therefore chosen
for study. Degree of dispersal of pigment in the chromatophores
was rated using the 5 point scale of Hogben and Slome (1931), where
stage I indicates maximum concentration of pigment, stage 5 indicates
maximum dispersion, and stages 2, 3, and 4 represent intermediate
conditions (fig. 1b). Chromatophores of the pleotelson were generally
all in the same stage of dispersion and rating therefore represents
all the chromatophores of the pleotelson. Values of 1.5. 2.5. 3.5.
and 4.5 were assigned in cases where chromatophores were at stages
