times of the diel cycle. Four hours prior to each experiment,
30 animals were placed in a pan of seawater which was wrapped in
aluminum foil and placed in a light-tight box. Macrocystis was
placed in the pan for food. Temperature was held constant at
14°0. At the start of the experiment, 15 animals were rated for
chromatophore stage and were then placed in a shallow black bowl.
The other 15 individuals were similarly rated and placed in a
white bowl. Both were then placed under a 60 watt incandescent
bulb providing 40 ft-c. of illumination, and the chromatophores
of each animal were staged every fifteen minutes through the course
of the experiment. When two successive ratings on the animals
in a bowl produced the same results, the backgrounds were reversed
such that animals from the black bowls were placed in white bowls
and vice versa. Animals were again staged every 15 minutes
until successive ratings were the same. This experiment was
conducted twice at each of the following times: 0600, 1200, 1800,
and 2400 hours. Water in the pans was changed at the end of I hour.
The results are shown in figures 8a and 8b. Chromatophore
adjustment from a dark adapted (punctate) state to a black back¬
ground under the experimental conditions takes between 30 and
45 minutes at each time of day (fig. 8a), with the initial rates
of pigment dispersal being the same. For a white background, a
similar adaptation appears to be complete within 15 minutes.
Adaptation after a subsequent switching of backgrounds occurred
within 15 minutes in all cases. Thus it appears that there is no
difference in rate of chromatophore expansion or contraction at
different times of day though the time needed to adapt may vary
depending on the experimental conditions and the initial and final
