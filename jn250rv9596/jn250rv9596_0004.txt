strong light. Twelve isopods were placed in a black pan and another
12 in a white pan, and both pans illuminated at 40 ft-c. by a
60 watt incandescent light bulb. Chromatophores were observed
every 4 hours. The results (fig. 2a) show no diurnal rhythm in
movement of chromatophore pigments; chromatophores remain expanded,
those on the black background exhibiting greater pigment dispersal
than those on the white background.
Evidence of an endogenous rhythm in chromatophore pigment dispersal
The preceding experiment shows that the rhythmic movement of
pigments in chromatophores persists in the absence of a light
stimulus, suggesting an endogenous rhythm is involved. If this is
indeed the case, one might expect that under prolonged monotonous
conditions, the biological clocks of individual isopods would
begin to get out of phase with one another. In order to determine
whether this occurred, ten isopods were selected and placed in pairs
into petri dishes containing seawater. Each dish contained one
animal in the 20-30mm range and one in the 15-20mm size range.
The dishes were wrapped with aluminum foil and placed in a light¬
tight box whose inside temperature remained relatively constant at
14°C throughout the experiment. The chromatophores of these isopods
were examined in dim light every 4 hours for a 4 day period, and
quickly returned to the dark. No significant asynchrony developed
during this period (fig. 3a) but the maximum degree of dispersion
of chromatophore pigments increased on successive days. A gradual
decrease in the degree of pigment concentration at night was also
indicated.
