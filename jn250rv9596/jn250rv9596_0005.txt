In order to see what might occur in more prolonged periods of
darkness, a total of 36 animals was kept in the dark in 3 containers
holding 12 isopods each. The containers were made light-tight
with aluminum foil, and placed under a light tight box. Water
In each container, and a small piece of Macrocystis added for food,
was changed every 24 hours. Animals were observed briefly in
dim light only at noon and midnight, and their chromatophores
rated. The results (fig.3b) show a rise in the amount of pigment
dispersion at 1200 hours for the first 4 days, while all chromatoÂ¬
phores were essentially punctate at night during this period.
From day 7, the amount of dispersion at 1200 hours stabilized at
approximately the 3.0 level while a gradual decrease in the degree
of concentration of pigment at 2400 hours was observed. By the
19th day the mean chromatophore ratings at 1200 and 2400 hours
were observed to level off in the 2.5 to 3.5 range. Twelve animals
died during the course of this experiment, mainly due to canibalism.
At the end of the 19th day, 8 of the surviving animals were selected.
placed in separate petri dishes wrapped in aluminum foil, placed
under a light-tight box, and observed every 4 to 6 hours for a
24 hour period. The results for each individual (fig. 4) show that
the reason the mean chromatophore ratings at 1200 and 2400 hours
tended to level off (fig. 3b) was because the endogenous rhythms
of the individual isopods had become out of phase, and also
because in some animals the chromatophores did not exhibit complete
contraction and/or expansion.
Since individuals in this experiment had been examined and
hence illuminated in dim light at least every 12 hours, a second
