Unromatophore Behavior in 1. resecata. p. 7
experiment was conducted in order to determine if individual
biological clocks get out of phase under conditions of uninterrupted
darkness. Fourteen individuals, all in the 20-30mm length range,
were placed in separate petri dishes wrapped with aluminum foil.
and placed in a light-tight box for 9 days. Food and water were
changed in the absence of light every 24 hours. Temperature was
constant at 14'C through the course of the experiment. On the
tenth day, the chromatophores of each individuals were examined in
dim light at intervals of approximately 2 hours for a 24 hour
period; between observations animals were returned to darkness.
The results (fig. 5, 6a) show that in continued darkness the
chromatophore rhythm of individuals became asynchronous. Both
the time of initiation of pigment dispersal, and the duration of
the period spent in the dispersed state varied between individuals.
Asynchrony is much greater than that exhibited by isopods maintained
on a normal day/night light cycle as controls.
Effect of different intensities of light on chromatophores.
Observations on chromatophore changes during ordinary day/night
light conditions suggest that the chromatophores of l. resecata
respond differently to different light intensities. In its natural
environment 1. resecata is subjected to frequent changes in light
intensity even during the day due to movement of the kelp canopy
with waves and tides, and to movement of the isopods up and down
kelp stipes. The next experiment was designed to test the response
of the chromatophores of 1. resecata to various intensities of
light. All tests were conducted between 2200 and 0200 hours
