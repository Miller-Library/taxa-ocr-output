because chromatophores are maximally contracted between those times.
The isopods used were dark-adapted for 4 hours in a plastic pan
of seawater which was wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in a
light-tight box at 14 C. Macrocystis was added to the pan for
food. Immediately before use isopods were checked for maximal
concentration of chromatophore pigments, and only animals with
a stage I concentration of pigments were selected for this experiment.
The selected animals were placed in black finger bowls in lots of
7, exposed to a particular intensity of light for I hour, and
then observed for chromatophore stage. Illumination was provided
by a 15 watt incandescent light bulb; adjustments in intensity
were made by varying the distance between the light source and the
isopods, and by varying the voltage used. Individual animals were
used only once, and the experiment was repeated at each intensity
3-7 times depending on the extent of variation between individuals.
Temperature remained at 12-14Â°C throughout the one hour period.
The results (fig. 7) show that chromatophore pigments are more
dispersed at higher light intensities than at lower intensities.
Rate of chromatophore expansion and contraction at different times
of day
Menke (1911) claimed that in 1. balthica chromatophores
expanded or contracted at different rates at different times of
the day or night, and that adaptation leading to a more punctate
state was faster at night than during the day because chromatophores
tended toward contraction at night. The following experiment was
designed to determine 1. resecata's ability to adapt to different
