Chromatophore Be
light.
2. Under constant strong illumination there is no diurnal rhythm
of movement of chromatophore pigments.
3. Under conditions of prolonged constant darkness individual
sopods become asynchronous in rhythmic chromatophore changes, and the
degree of pigment dispersal and concentration is decreased in some
animals.
4. The degree of expansion or contraction of chromatophores
depends on both background color and light intensity.
5. Rates of change in chromatophores accompanying changes in
background color are constant at all times of the day or night.
6. After constant strong illumination for 48 hours on a black
background, the rate at which isopods adapted to a white back
ground was decreased, while the accompanying switch from white to
black background is unchanged.

help and advice. I would especially like to thank Dr. Donald P.
Abbott for his patience and encouragement.
