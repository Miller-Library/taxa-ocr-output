dispersed during the day and concentrated at night. During the
day pigments were significantly more dispersed in animals on a
black background than in those on a white background; animals on
the gray substratum were intermediate in pigment dispersion.
Behavior of chromatophores under constant condition of illumination
The following experiments were carried out to determine whether
expansion and contraction of chromatophore pigments persists under
conditions of constant light or darkness. Three pans, each
containing 12 animals, were kept in the dark for a total of 72
hours. During this time, chromatophores of all animals were
examined with the aid of a dissecting scope and low intensity light
every 4 hours. Temperature ranged from 14°C to 17°C during the
experiment. The results (fig. 2c) show that pigments were punctate
at night and dispersed during the day. These results are in good
agreement with the observations of Oguro (1959) on Idotea japonica
and Kleinholz (1937) on Ligia baudiniana.
A second group of isopods was kept under conditions of constant
low intensity illumination provided by a 15 watt incandescent
light bulb. Fifteen animals were placed in a shallow black pan
and another 15 in a white pan. Light intensity was held at 0.04
ft-c. except when the chromatophores were being observed. Animals
were checked every 4 to 8 hours over a 60 hour period. The results
(fig. 2a) show that on both backgrounds the chromatophore rhythm
persisted. This experiment was repeated once so that a total of
30 animals were looked at on each colored substrate.
A third group of animals was kept under conditions of constant
