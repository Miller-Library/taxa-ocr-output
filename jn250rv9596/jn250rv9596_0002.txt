intermediate between those defined by Hogben and Slome (1931). In
cases where chromatophores in different stages of dispersion were
present at the same time, a subjective judgement was made as to
the relative abundance of each stage in the posterior region of
the pleotelson, and intermediate values were again used. Increments
smaller than 0.5 were not used. Ratings for a sample of 15 animals
could be completed in less than 5 minutes. The black chromatophores
which were often present around the edge of the pleotelson and
occasionally found around spots on the pleotelson which contained
no chromatophores, were not rated. White chromatophores which were
occasionally found on the pleotelson were also not rated.
All light intensities were measured with a Photovolt 200M
light meter. For intensities over 2 ft-c., a 25% neutral density
filter was placed over the meter.
Both male and female isopods, ranging in length from 15mm to
3Omm, were used in the experiments.
Behavior of chromatophores in a natural light regime.
Initial experiments were made to determine the behavior of
chromatophores under normal day and night light condition. Lots
of twelve animals each were placed in; (1) a black enamaled pan,
(2) a white enamaled pan, and (3) a pan with a gray background.
The pans were exposed to daylight but not direct sunlight. Animals
were not fed during the experiment, and sea water in the pans was
changed every 4 hours. The temperature of the water remained
constant at 14 C. Chromatophores were observed at intervals of
4 to 6 hours over a 3 day period. Figure I shows the results:
under a normal day/night light regime, chromatophore pigments were
