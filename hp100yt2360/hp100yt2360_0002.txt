INTRODUCTION
Predatory marine snails of the genus Conus have long been of interest because of
their unique hunting strategies that employ peptide toxins to paralyze prey. In cone
snails, the chitinous radular teeth resemble barbed hypodermic needles that are used
to inject venom into the prey. Each species has a unique tooth structure, with varying
size, shape, and number of barbs. These differences are often used as a basis for
phylogenetic classifications (Kohn et al., 1999).
When resting, the snail holds its proboscis retracted inside the rostrum. When
prey is sensed by water-borne chemical signals (Spengler and Kohn, 1995), the
proboscis is extended with a tooth held in place near the tip (Greene and Kohn, 1989).
Searching behavior begins, and when contact with the prey is achieved, the snail
impales the prey, paralyzing it, and pulls it into the expanded rhynchodeum by
contraction of the proboscis (Kohn, 1956).
Delivery of Conus venom involves generation and storage of radular teeth, transfer
of a tooth to the proboscis, and final ejection of the venom. These processes are
carried out within a complex venom apparatus that is relatively invariable between
Conus species (Halstead, 1988). Marshall, et al. (in press) have detailed the
anatomical correlates of the venom apparatus of the cone snail C. californicus (Fig.
1). It is highly likely that similar structures are found in piscivorous feeders such as
C. striatus and C. catus.
In Conus, the radular sac consists of two arms. Teeth are manufactured in the long
arm and stored in the short arm (Marsh, 1977). Using scanning electron microscopy,
Kohn et al. (1972) verified that each of the radular teeth is basically a sheet,
