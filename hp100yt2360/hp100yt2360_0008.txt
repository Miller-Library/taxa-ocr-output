the proboscis (Fig. 15), no constriction or other obvious changes in the muscular ring
occurred prior to, during, or after venom ejection. Although it was difficult to
ascertain the actual duration of venom ejection, we based our estimate on the time
elapsed from when the tooth impales the prey to when the snail starts to pull back on
the tooth in preparation for swallowing (Fig. 16). In every case examined, this time
was 3-4 video frames (n=6).
DISCUSSION
An initial hypothesis regarding the role of the ligament was that it acts as a
protective barrier that prevents the contents of the tooth from seeping out of the base.
Given this potential role, we hypothesized that flow rates of teeth with the ligament
attached would be slower than that of teeth without the ligament. However, ejection
studies using the experimental set-up described revealed that no significant
differences in volume released were observed in teeth with and without ligament. In
both cases, volume, flow, and pressure are all directly proportional. Whether the
ligament indeed acts as a protective barrier remains to be seen. Future studies of the
structure of the ligament using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy
could be of help in bringing greater understanding of its role and function in venom
ejection in Conus species.
Ejection studies also revealed that a second opening located near the recurved barb
of the radular tooth is present. We were unable to locate this second opening through
scanning electron microscopy, mostly because of difficulties in achieving the correct
orientation of the tooth. Further investigation of the exact location, size, and function
