ABSTRACT
Similar to other members of its genus, Conus striatus has a highly evolved venom
apparatus that serves to inject paralyzing venom into its prey through a hollow,
tubular radular tooth. Although much research is currently being conducted on the
properties of the venom itself, little investigation has been done to elucidate the
biomechanics behind the snail’s ability to inject its venom. Studies were carried out
with individual radular teeth that defined the pressure-flow characteristics in order to
estimate the pressure used by a snail to eject venom during prey capture. Pressure
and flow were directly proportional over the range of investigated pressures (up to 4
cmHg) and flow rates (up to 2 ul s*). Behavioral observations of prey capture were
carried out with C. catus, a closely related species that employs similar toxins. Video
data revealed the approximate duration of venom ejection to be about 100 ms. The
duration of venom ejection by C. striatus is probably similar, and the volume of
ejected venom in this species can be 20 ul or more based on ’milking’ trials. Data
suggest that the pressure necessary to carry out such an ejection must range from 2-4
atm.
