exposed, and the tooth was then sealed in place with epoxy and allowed to dry for 5-
10 minutes. The tooth and tubing were then mounted and connected to a
microinjection apparatus that served as the pressure source. A schematic diagram of
the setup is shown in Fig. 2. As pressure was applied to the tooth, blue fluid
consisting of distilled water and .03% Blue #1 dye flowed out of the microinjection
apparatus and filled the mounted tooth. Blue fluid from the tooth was ejected into a
separate capillary tube filled with clear distilled water. The set-up was connected to a
pressure transducer, which was connected to an oscilloscope that recorded the voltage
changes during each timed pressure pulse applied with an eppendorf microinjector
5242 apparatus. Calibration of pressure transducer is as follows:
cm H20 = 0.7529 + 0.5704 * mV (Fig. 3)
The experimental procedure was recorded using a Sony SSC-C374 color video
camera. Teeth were viewed through a Nikon SMZ-2T microscope. Video images of
the tooth were used to analyze how much fluid was being ejected with each pressure
pulse (Fig. 4). The volume of fluid released into the capillary tube was measured by
calibrating the length of fluid inside the capillary tube when a known volume of fluid
was added.
Scanning electron microscopy
Teeth were cleaned briefly in concentrated sodium hypochlorite. A separate set of
teeth was kept free of sodium hypochlorite. Teeth were immersed in 4%
glutaraldehyde and were dehydrated through increasing concentrations of ethanol.
Prior to scanning, teeth were air-dried, mounted on stubs with double-sided carbon
tape, and coated with a thin layer of gold-palladium in a vacuum evaporator. They
