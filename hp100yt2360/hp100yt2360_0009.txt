of this opening would be helpful in understanding the mechanics behind venom
ejection in cone snails.
Video data from venom ejection by living Conus catus revealed that tooth
penetration into prey, paralysis of prey, and time prior to retraction of the proboscis
spans approximately 100 ms. We take this to be a minimum period for venom
ejection. It is highly likely that the duration of venom ejection in C. striatus is similar.
Manual milking of C. striatus revealed that approximately 20ul of venom is released
per ejection (Dr. Joseph Schulz, personal communication). Given these observations,
we were able to deduce that the rate of volume ejection by C. striatus would be 200
uls
Extrapolating from our pressure-flow data (Fig. 12), we were able to ascertain that
approximately 2-4 atm of pressure is required to inject 20 ul of fluid out of the C.
striatus radular tooth in 100 ms. However, our data were gathered using distilled
water as a venom replacement. Because venom is probably much more viscous, even
greater pressures would be required.
The literature to date characterizes the tooth to be located at the tip of the
proboscis prior to penetration into prey (Marsh, 1977). The finding that prior to
penetration, the tooth was actually located farther back into the proboscis is obviously
in contrast to that idea. The mechanism by which the tooth is propelled from its initial
location 5-8 mm away from the tip of the proboscis into the prey has yet to be
determined. It appears that the same force that propels the venom forward also
propels the tooth, although this observation has yet to be supported by conclusive
evidence. The anatomical structure that exerts this force remains to be elucidated.
