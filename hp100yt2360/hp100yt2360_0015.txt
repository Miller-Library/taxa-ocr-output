Fig. 11b. Graph of incremental volume ejected over time corresponding to the
pressure transients illustrated in Panel a.
Fig. 12. Graph of flow rate vs. pressure. Data points are means (+ 5.0) for pressure
pulses of 100 hPa, 200 hPa, 400 hPa, and 800 hPa (applied pressures, 100 ms pulses).
n=3 for all, except n=1 for 1000 hPa.
Fig. 13. Modified diagram of venom apparatus. Arrows indicate the observed location
of the tooth as well as the muscular ring inside the proboscis.
Fig. 14. Relevant frames depicting duration of venom ejection in C. catus. Arrow in
Frame 1 depicts the radular tooth located a few millimeters away from the tip of the
proboscis as observed prior to ejection. Frame II shows that the radular tooth has
already penetrated the prey. Frame III shows the radular tooth still impaled to the
prey. Arrow in Frame IV reveals that the cone snail has started pulling back on the
radular tooth out of the prey in preparation for swallowing. Estimated duration of
venom ejection is spread out over Frames II-IV. Time lapse is 1/3 seconds per frame.
