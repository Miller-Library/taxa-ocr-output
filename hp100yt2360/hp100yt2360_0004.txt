maximum flow rate is directly proportional to peak pressure. Second, we have
identified some previously unreported morphological characteristics of the C. striatus
radular tooth through video data and scanning electron microscopy. Video data of
venom ejection in C. catus revealed that the pressure that expels the venom also
seems to insert the tooth into the victim. Data also indicated the approximate
duration of venom ejection. Manual ’milking’ of C. striatus revealed the approximate
volume of venom released per ejection. From all of these data, we were able to
estimate the approximate pressure necessary for a living C. striatus to eject its venom.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of C. striatus were obtained from American Samoa, and specimens of
C. catus were obtained from Hawaii.
Extraction of the teeth
The radular sacs of C. striatus were removed and dissected from the animal and
stored in -80 °C for several months prior to use. Teeth were dissected from the short
arm of the radular sac, rinsed and stored in distilled water, and kept in 4 °C up to 3
days prior to use in ejection studies. Teeth were kept for approximately 15 days prior
to use in electron microscopy.
Ejection studies
Teeth stored in distilled water were air-dried prior to use. Because we wanted to
determine differences in fluid flow with and without the ligament attached, some
teeth were left with the ligament intact, while the ligament and base of a number of
teeth were cut using a microknife prior to use. Each tooth was placed inside a
segment of clear plastic tubing. The tubing was positioned with the tip of the tooth
