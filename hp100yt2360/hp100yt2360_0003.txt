presumably of chitin, rolled into a hollow tube. This tube has a large central lumen
through which venom from the venom duct passes during the injection into the prey.
In C. striatus, the venom enters the tooth via an adapical opening and leaves via an
apical opening (Freeman, 1974). In preparation for prey capture, a single tooth is
transported into the pharynx where it is surrounded by the relaxed proboscis and
grasped by the sphincter near the tip of the proboscis (Greene and Kohn, 1989;
Hermitte, 1946). Once at the tip of the proboscis, the lumen of the tooth is thought to
be empty (Marsh, 1977), but findings from Marshall, et al. (in press) suggest that
active peptides similar to those found in the anterior venom duct are present in the
tooth lumen as well. Finally, the proboscis extends the tooth held at the tip, impales
the prey, and injects the venom.
How the force for final venom ejection out of the tooth or for tooth penetration is
produced remains unknown. Although a muscular bulb posterior to the venom duct
has often been hypothesized to provide the needed force, there is no direct evidence
for this idea (Olivera, 1997). The muscular bulb does not appear to be capable of
providing sufficient pressure to inject the venom (Songdahl, 1973). It is more likely
that the proboscis itself provides the force for venom ejection (Kohn, et al. 1999).
This report provides a description of the processes involved in venom ejection in
C. striatus and C. catus, species that prey exclusively on fishes. Toxic components
exist in the venom and details can be found in studies by Freeman (1974), Ramilo, et
al. (1992), Cruz (1996), and Hahin, et al. (1991). Details of the mechanisms by which
venom enters the tooth and is ejected into the prey are lacking. We have used isolated
teeth to examine the biomechanical properties of ejection. First, we have found that
