were examined with a Hitachi S-450 scanning electron microscope. No significant
differences in scanning electron microscopy were observed in teeth cleaned with
sodium hypochlorite and teeth kept free of sodium hypochlorite.
Video data from C. catus
Feeding behavior of C. catus was filmed with the same camera and microscope
used for the ejection experiment. A fish (guppy) was held with a pair of forceps and
presented to the C. catus for feeding.
Milking' studies of C. striatus
Part of the fin of a fish was attached to a 1.7 ml micro-centrifuge tube. The tube
was then sealed with a piece of latex. This target was presented to C. striatus to
induce venom ejection into the tube (Fig. 5). Volume of venom ejected was estimated
by comparison with known volumes in other tubes.
RESULTS
The radular tooth
The radular tooth of C. striatus is approximately 8 mm long with a diameter of
0.235 mm. The shaft is cylindrical and armed apically with a barb and a barbed blade
together with a long backward pointing process with a recurved tip. A ligament is
attached to the base of the tooth. A schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 6. Scanning
electron microscopy of adapical and apical opening are shown in Figs. 7 and 8,
respectively.
Video data from ejection studies revealed a second opening associated with the
large recurved barb. Fluid would flow out of this location, although exact site of fluid
exit was unclear (Fig. 9).
