Ejection studies
Minimal differences in total volume ejected at various pressures applied for 100
ms pulses were found between teeth with ligament attached and those without (Fig.
10a). Almost no differences in the flow rate at a constant applied pressure of 400 hPa
were found in teeth with and without ligament (Fig. 10b). Ã–ther measurements
showed that pressure sensed at the basal end of the tooth was directly proportional to
applied pressure.
Table I shows the different variables measured as pressure from 100 hPa to 1000
hPa was applied for 100 ms pulses. Fig. 1 la shows the voltage changes recorded on
the oscilloscope for 3 different pressure applications. Fig. 1 1b plots the volume of
fluid released following the 100 ms pressure pulses. Initial slopes over the first
second were calculated to determine fluid flow rate. Rate of flow of fluid ejection is
directly proportional to peak pressure recorded on the oscilloscope (Fig.12).
Venom ejection by C. catus
Video footage of C. catus venom ejection revealed that the radular tooth was not
located at the tip of the proboscis prior to ejection as previously observed in other
Conus species (Marsh, 1977). Rather, the tooth was located approximately one tooth
length away from the tip of the proboscis prior to ejection (Fig. 13). In every case, the
tooth remained in this position until the apparent moment of venom ejection. Within
one video frame, the tooth was forced out to the tip of the proboscis, presumably by
the same pressure that enables venom ejection. The basal end appeared to be grasped
by the tip of the proboscis, and the volume behind the tooth then swelled for several
frames. Although a donut shaped ring, presumably of muscle, is present at the base of
