ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 would like to thank Dr. William F. Gilly for his steadfast guidance and unwavering
patience throughout my learning experience. This project would not have been
possible without his constant support and caring mentoring. I would also like to
extend my gratitude to Chris Patton for his help with SEM, Dr. Joseph Schulz for
providing advice, assistance, Conus specimens, and video data, and the entire Gilly
lab for opening their doors to a novice learner.
