no barnacle had copious sperm). These parameters can be sampled and
measured by personnel with minimal biological training. Quantitative
pigment differences, while more difficult to measure, would also be
indicative of damage. Further work needs to be done on the natural
variability of Pollicipes in an unpolluted enviornment to aid detection
of lesser degrees of damage from pollution.
