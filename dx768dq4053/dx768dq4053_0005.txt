Point Pinos
For present purposes, the region of the Pacific Grove outfall can
be divided into three areas (Fig. 1) showing obvious qualitative
differences. Areas B and C are apparently relatively normal. Pollicipes
here always grow in association with Mytilus. Amphipods are abundant in
Pollicipes clusters, and at least three species of limpets are found on
Pollicipes valves. Balanus glandula may also attach to Pollicipes
capitulum. Isopods are infrequent, and never more than two occur on an
individual barnacle. The stalks are very firmly attached to the substratum,
and frequently have coralline algae or young brown algae growing on them.
A dense mat of detached Phyllospadix blades is often intertwined around
the bases of the stalks.
Area A (Fig. 1), which receives the most direct contact with the
effluent, is conspicuously different. Here no adult Mytilus are found,
though occasionally small (ยง1 cm.) mussels, having a yellow, translucent
shell, are seen. Amphipods and limpets are absent from Pollicipes clusters.
Balanus glandula occurs on nearby rocks but never on the Pollicipes
capitulum. Isopods are common, and as many as eight may be found on an
individual barnacle. The Pollicipes themselves are small, few being of
minimum reproductive size (rostro-carinal distance of 17.2 mm; Hilgard,
1960). None were found measuring more than 25 mm. Maximum sizes of
30.5 mm. occurred in areas B and C, and animals measuring up to 37 mm.
were found at Mussel Point. The stalks of Pollicipes in area A are
loosely attached to the substratum, and can be removed by hand. No
coralline or brown macro algae are attached to the stalks; instead the
