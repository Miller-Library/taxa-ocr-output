DISCUSSION
Raw sewage in moderate concentrations could have beneficial
effects for Pollicipes. This barnacle, an opportunistic rather than
selective feeder, takes a large amount of particulate matter as food
(Howard and Scott, 1959). Near an outfall, the level of organic
particulate matter is certainly higher than normal, so that under other
favorable physical conditions such as those at Point Pinos, Pollicipes
could flourish, being helped by the sewage. Mytilus californianus,
Pollicipes' major competitor for space along the coast, is also an
efficient filter feeder, but it dies close to sewer outfalls. Pisaster
ochraceus, for which Pollicipes ranks high as a food source (Feder, 1959),
is also absent near the Point Pinos outfall. These three conditions;
increased food, absence of competition, and lack of predation could
enhance Pollicipes growth near an outfall.
In area A at Point Pinos the barnacles, although currently doing
very poorly, are the only large sedentary animals abundant on the rocks.
Their clusters cover much of the suitable substratum. According to
Barnes and Reese (1960), Pollicipes grow very slowly, not reaching sexual
maturity before the fifth year and not achieving full growth until the
twentieth. Although it is possible that some of the largest Pollicipes
in area A at Point Pinos were there before the outfall was built,
this is unlikely, as there are many small barnacles and young do occasionally
settle here. Comparison of present conditions on Point Pinos with those
described in a study by Mitter (1969) indicate that the grossest detrimental
effects of the sewage are recent ones.
