Carmel Outfall Area
Some sampling of the Pollicipes population was carried out in
the area of the City of Carmel sewer outfall, Carmel Bay, California
(Fig. 7). While irregular mixing by waves occurs at the inshore
rocky reef, strong southerly currents move offshore water from Mission
Point toward Point Lobos (Bachelor, et al. 1970). Correlated with
this, Pollicipes show increasing levels of reproduction and recruitment
at increasing distances south of the outfall. At Point Pinos the
current system is much more complex and such an obvious gradient of damage
does not exist.
Conditions at the Carmel sewer outfall are much less harmful to
Pollicipes than those at the Pacific Grove outfall. Some successful
fertilization occurs four feet from the pipe (station 2), and young
settle out from the plankton in much larger numbers than in area A
at Point Pinos. Studies of dilution of the effluent (Bachelor, et al,
1970) indicate that it comes inshore on the beach south of station 5
and is fairly well diluted south of there. The Pollicipes data are
consistent with this finding; note the sudden jump in the proportion
of animals reproducing and in those bearing newly settled young between
stations 5 and 6.
