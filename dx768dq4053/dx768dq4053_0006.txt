latter are often covered with an algal slime composed of brown (Feldmannia
chitinicola), green (Blidingia minima), and blue green (Oscillatoria and
Entophysalis deusta) algal species. The same slime occurs in the crevices
between capitular plates; it may become so thick that it covers the
calcareous spines on the stalk, but it does not occur inside the mantle
cavity. (Outside of area A, algal slimes occur on the stalk but never
as thickly.) The bases of the stalks do not have Phyllospadix blades
intertwined about them, but have entrapped large amounts of sand.
Figure 2 shows the results of the survey of reproduction and
recruitment in the three samples made at Point Pinos. In area A, directly
exposed to the effluent, there is tremendous damage. In a total sample
of 692 Pollicipes there are no ovigerous lamellae and essentially no
production of ova and no settlement of cyprid larvae from the plankton.
At stations 3 and 4 many isolated animals were found. These indicate
the former presence of large clusters of Pollicipes (see Barnes and
Reese, 1960). At station 4, among 27 of the largest barnacles only
eight were above minimum reproductive size. Pollicipes closest to the
outfall are dying; 11% of the samples taken 26 May 1970 from station 2
had rotted cirri and decaying stalks.
Animals in area B show some evidence of reproductive inhibition.
Not only was the onset of reproduction delayed in this population, but
the percentages of individuals brooding ovigerous lamellae and bearing
newly settled young are consistently below those of Mussel Point
(Fig. 3) and those of area C (Fig. 4). Areas B and C follow the same
trends, but area B does less well. Statistically, differences in
percentage with young are always significant (P ยง.05) and differences
