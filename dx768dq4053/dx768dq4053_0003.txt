METHODS
Pollicipes polymerus used in this study were taken from the
following areas: (1) the Pacific Grove sewage outfall area at Point
Pinos (14 stations); (2) the Carmel sewage outfall area north of
Monastery Beach (6 stations); (3) the Pacific Grove shoreline from
Lovers Point to the Great Tide Pool (8 stations); and (4) a control
area at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove (6 stations).
All barnacles were taken in areas and at intertidal levels where
they were sizable and abundant. Only the largest individuals occurring
in close association with others of their kind (and which therefore had
opportunity for cross fertilization) were taken. When possible, about
60 barnacles were taken at each station.
After collection each Pollicipes was measured (distance from
rostrum to carina) and examined for young recently settled on the stalk.
Then it was cut open and examined for the presence of ovarian masses
in the stalk and ovigerous lamellae in the mantle cavity. Enlarged
ovarian masses indicated that the individual was a reproductively active
member of the population. The presence of ovigerous lamellae (oval,
flattened masses of developing larvae being brooded by the adult)
indicated successful fertilization. Animals with neither were considered
to be non-reproducing members of the population.
After examination, the percentage of barnacles which had enlarged
ovaries or ovigerous lamellae or both was determined and recorded as the
percentage of the sample reproducing (% reproducing). The percentage of
the sample with ovigerous lamellae was determined and recorded as
