ABSTRACT
1. In the period 29 April to 27 May 1970 studies of the distribution,
reproduction, recruitment, and pigments of Pollicipes polymerus were
carried out on populations in both polluted and unpolluted areas.
2. Near sewage outfalls Pollicipes clusters may be abundant; however,
they lack associated biota of polychaetes, amphipods, limpets and
epizoic algae. They are loosely attached to rocks and are usually
covered with an algal slime.
3. Within a 230 foot radius of an outfall with high residual chlorine
the barnacles were not reproducing. Recruitment occurred only on the
outer fringes of the area. At a second outfall with lower residual
chlorine a few Pollicipes were reproducing and some recruitment was
occurring within four feet of the mouth of the pipe. The levels of
reproduction and recruitment here were lower than in unpolluted areas.
4. Pollicipes shows decreasing damage with increasing distance from
the outfalls.
5. Thin layer chromatogram studies show that several carotinoid
pigments found in the stalk hemolymph of normal Pollicipes are lacking
in individuals living near sewer outfalls.
6. Pollicipes appears to have some value as a quantitative indicator
of the effects of marine sewage pollution.
