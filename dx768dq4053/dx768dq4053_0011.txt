for the chromatography. Each sample was spotted on the plate and the
spots were run in a 30% petroleum ether-acetone mixture. A standard
composed of B-carotene, astaxanthin, lutein and echino-none was also
spotted on the plate and run. The absorption spectrum from 550 nm.
to 380 nm. for each sample was taken on a Beckman DK2A Ratio Recording
Spectrophotometer.
All the pigments noted by Holter (1969) were found in the stalk
fluids of animals from area B, at Point Pinos, and from Mussel Point.
In area A however, three pigments were missing from the stalk fluid--
astaxanthin, lutein, and the astaxanthin ester. Only B-carotine,
isozeaxanthin and zeaxanthin were present.
The absorption spectra for area B and Mussel Point are identical.
Both absorptions rise steadily to a broad plateau from 476 to 450 nm.
Expanding the plateau shows two peaks, at 472 nm. and 453 nm. The
absorption spectrum for the stalk fluid from animals from area A
reflects the changed pigment composition here. The absorption rises
to a slight plateau at 472 nm., then continues to rise to the major
peak at 432 nm. It falls off slowly until 413 nm. and rapidly thereafter.
Possible quantitative differences in the amount of pigment exist
between animals in areas A and B and those at Mussel Point. Less
pigment was extracted from area B animals than from the Mussel Point
controls. Considerably less pigment was extracted from animals in
area A. If quantitative differences do exist, pigment determination
would be a valuable additional indicator of pollution damage.
