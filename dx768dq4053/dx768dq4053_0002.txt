INTRODUCTION
The effects of sewage pollution on most marine organisms are
almost unknown, and good indicator organisms by which pollution damage
can be measured are lacking. Counts of coliform bacteria are routinely
used to indicate degree of pollution. These counts may be extremely
variable, even from hour to hour, and they give no indication of possible
pollution damage to shore organisms. A better indicator is needed; one
possibility is the common stalked barnacle Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby,
1833).
This barnacle is abundant on wave-swept rocky shores from the Bering
Strait to the middle of Baja, California, being restricted to the upper
two-thirds of the intertidal zone (Ricketts and Calvin, 1969). It is
the only pedunculated barnacle found in the intertidal zone in North
America (Cornwall, 1951) and it does not occur subtidally (Barnes and
Reese, 1959). Pollicipes is one of the few sedentary marine animals
which is numerous not only in unpolluted areas but also occurs close
to the shoreline sewer outfalls at Pacific Grove and Carmel, California.
Hilgard (1960) determined that the animals reproduce for eight
months of the year. Preliminary observations indicated that while the
animals away from the outfall were reproducing normally those close to
it were not, suggesting that reproduction in this species might provide
a useful measure of pollution damage.
