Pacific Grove Shoreline
Current studies of Point Pinos carried out in July 1969 and April
1970 (using fluorescene dye packets, drift bottles and a team of observers
from the Hopkins Marine Station), indicated a current moving northward
around Point Pinos and into Monterey Bay (Fig. 1). Many drift bottles
released at the point landed on Pacific Grove beaches. It appears that
some of Pacific Grove's sewage is not moving out to sea but is being
carried back into the bay. The reproductive condition in samples of
Pollicipes from along the southern shore of Monterey Bay is shown in
Figure 5. Station 7 is about 75 feet from a 12" drain pipe which serves
not only as a storm drain but also for occasional dumping of sewage
when the treatment plant is overloaded. Animals here show the poorest
development of ovaries and a very low proportion of barnacles bear ovigerous
lamellae. The other populationson this shore showing low proportions of
ovigerous lamellae occur at stations 2 and 3, lying closest to Point Pinos.
Figure 6 compares stations 2, 3 and 7 with stations 1, 4, 5, 6, and
8 and with Pollicipes at Mussel Point. Statistically, there is no
difference between the latter set of stations and the barnacles on Mussel
Point (P Â«.05 for all three categories). The differences between the
first set of stations and the second are significant (P (.Ol for all
three categories), indicating that not all of the effluent is diluted
at sea but some comes back into shore at harmful levels.
