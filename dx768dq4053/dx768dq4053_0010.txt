Pigment Analysis
Normal Pollicipes, both mature and immature, have a reddish-orange
hemolymph in the stalk which is released when the stalk is sliced open.
In Pollicipes from area A at Point Pinos, stalk fluid is colored a
dirty gray.
Holter (1969) found six carotinoid pigments occurring in the stalk
fluid of Pollicipes: B-carotine, isozeaxanthin (?), an astaxanthin ester,
lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin. Cheesman and others (1967) found
that astaxanthin-protein complexes are frequently linked to reproductive
and developmental processes. Holter hypothesizes that this lipo-protein
complex mediates the transport of large water soluble molecules across
lipid-bound membranes. This transportation could be important when
transfer of critical supplies for egg production is essential. Pollicipes
hemolymph appears to act as the store for the astaxanthin lipo-protein
complex.
The stalk fluids in Pollicipes from areas A and B on Point Pinos
and from Mussel Point were analyzed using thin layer gel chromatography
to determine qualitative differences in the pigments present.
In each area, about 125 ml. of stalk fluid was collected from
two clusters of Pollicipes (about 150 animals in each cluster), and centrifuged
to remove sand and grit. The pigments were extracted from the fluid with
acetone. Petroleum ether (b.p. 20-40Â° C) was added and the carotenoids
transferred to the petroleum ether phase by the addition of water. The
petroleum ether was repeatedly washed with cold tap water until free
of acetone, and then concentrated under a nitrogen stream. Schleicher
and Schuell precoated silica gel plates (^1500), 250/thick, were used
