Photographs taken in the spring of 1969 show that the rocks near the
pipe were covered with macroalgae at that time; now they are covered
with Hildenbrandia or a yellow, diatomacious slime. The general area
appeared much less damaged a year ago than it does now. Heavy chlorination
of the sewage was begun only about five months ago (early in 1970).
suggesting that chlorine or chlorinated compounds may be the most damaging
agent in sewage.
Both Carmel and Pacific Grove sewage treatment plants use primary
treatment and handle mostly domestic wastes. The major difference between
the two effluents is in the residual chlorine. In Pacific Grove sewage
the chlorine residuals can reach levels of up to at least 45 parts per
million (ppm) at the outfall mouth, but in Carmel sewage they are 2-5
Ppm. The fact that Pollicipes at Carmel show some reproduction and
recruitment within four feet of the mouth of the outfall pipe suggest
that chlorine or chlorinated compounds are the likliest agents causing
damage.
Pollicipes in area A are not recruiting enough larvae from the
plankton to sustain their current population level. The clusters will
probably disappear as the adults die off. In area B, recruitment is
probably sufficient to maintain the population close to current levels.
Pollicipes polymerus shows possibilities for use as an indicator
of pollution damage. Of the parameters investigated, fertilization
(as indicated by the presence of ovigerous lamellae) appears to be the
most sensitive to pollution. The proportions of the population bearing
new juveniles and the proportion reproducing are useful as well. Sperm
content represents another possible variable, (in area A at Point Pinos
