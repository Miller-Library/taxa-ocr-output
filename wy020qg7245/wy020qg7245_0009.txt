a maximum minimum estimate of barnacle handling time is six hours. Actual handling
times are probably much less than these theoretical limits and more accurately
obtained directly by a research design intended to do so.
Another aspect of the snail population that may change with the tides is
the density distribution. There is a tendency for densities at lower levels to
be higher at low tide. This is very difficult to reconcile with what has pre-
viously been described for snail behaviour since their density in the uppermost
level remains unchanged between tides. If anything, the snails are not shifting
their distribution upward at high tide. What, then could possibly explain this
phenomenon? First, and most facile, is the hypothesis that such differences
are merely artifacts doe to experimental error. The surge and presence of water
at high tide does tend to complicate sampling somewhat, and may result in underÂ¬
counting. Perhaps, also, the snails are moving to parts of the habitat matrix
which are undersampled due to an inappropriate sampling method.
In either case the densities may not be changing at all in any of the
levels. That is not to say that the population remains static in any given
height range--almost certainly, snails traverse up and down, but the net movement
of the populati on as a whole may be zero. This means that the snails maintain
a steady-state height distribution, although their choice of microhabitat and
activity depend to an extent on the tides.
On the other hand, the observed differences may accurately reflect reality.
in which case an explanation is not readily forthcoming. Since the influx of
snails is not from above, they could be entering the study area from the surrounding
depths. Why there should be a small net movement upward at low tide and downward
at high tide at the lower range of distribution, however, is not immediately
obvious,
The emrgent picture of predatory activity is one which depicts the snails
