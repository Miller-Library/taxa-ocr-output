RESULTS
The mean densities of Acanthina with respect to microhabitat, activity,
and height zone, averaged over all tides, is shown in figure 1. Overall, thne
average density of snails in the study area was 4.62 m"4. The snails were
densest from 0.8 mto l.Om (7.61 m-2) and 1.2 m to 1.4 m (6.76â€œ2), but reached
a density of only 3.06 m"2 in the height zone between these two (1.0 m to 1.2 m).
Acanthina were never observed in quadrats above 1.4 m. As shown in figure 2,
however, the population was distributed such that the bulk of the snails (63.857)
was to be found in the lowermost zone, the fewest snails (14.657) were in the
uppermost portion of their range, and an intermediate but disproportionately
small fraction (21.39%) for the amount of habitat available (figure 2B) was found
in between.
It is evident in both figures 1 and 2 that within any given height zone
the activity of choice of the majority of snails was to sit still in a refuge.
In the lowermost zone a fair proportion of the population (22.237), one-third of
thne snails within that zone, could also be found on rock faces, engaged in
sitting still--once again the most common activity--feeding, or moving. 907 of
the snails in height zone 2 (18.86% of all snails) were sitting still in refuges,
with only 2.25% of the entire population situated on rock faces, most of which
were stationary. On rock faces in zone 3, more snails were feeding or moving
than sitting still, a reverse pattern of that seen on rock faces in lower zones.
Feeding activity in zone 3 seemed restricted to faces, and was not observed in
refuges. Looking at all height zones, 677 of all snails were sitting still in
