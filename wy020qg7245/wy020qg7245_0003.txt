MATERIALS AND METHODS
A study site of approximately 49 m2 was established in a moderately pro¬
tected area which was felt to be representative of the mid- to upper-intertidal
in terms of substrate relief, orientation, and organic cover. A tape measure was
pulled taut in an east-west direction through the center of the study site.
Seven surface-conforming transect lines were centered at one-meter intervals
along the tape and were run perpendicularly to it on either side. Surface-con¬
forming transect lines were used because they reduced the tendency to over-sam¬
ple horizontal surfaces, a problem with taut lines in areas of high relief.
Subsequent checking of the placement of the transects indicated that they were
roughly parallel to each other, all being within 4.50 £ 0.50 to 10.5° + 0.30
west of true north. The transect line itself consisted of a light metal alloy
chain along which seven tags were spaced one meter apart, thus enabling a sam-
pling density of at most one quadrant per square meter of surface area. The
center of a permanent 25 cm by 25 cm quadrat was uniquely marked at each of the
tags using small plastic labels mounted onto the surface with marine epoxy. The
corners of the quadrats were marked on the substrate with small dots of nail
polish. The heights of the quadrats were determined using a stadia rod, a
transit, and local reference pegs whose elevations had been professionally
surveyed.
The percent cover of sessile space occupants, sand, and bare rock (here-
after referred to as free space) within each quadrat was estimated using a
flexible plastic sheet upon which was marked a regular grid of 100 points. With
