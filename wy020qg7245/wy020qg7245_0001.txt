INTRODUCTION
Acanthina punctulata (Sowerby,1825) is a predatory gastropod of the mid to
upper rocky intertidal. In Monterey Bay it is reported to feed on Tegula
funebralis (A. Adams, 1855), Littorina planaxis (Philippi, 1847), L. scutulata
(Gould, 1849), Balanus glandula (Darwin, 1854), Chthamalus dalli (Pilsbry, 1916),
C. fissus (Darwin, 1854), and small Nucella emarginata (Deshayes, 1839). However,
the extent to which it may affect prey populations in this region has been largely
unresearched.
Glynn (1965) lists A. spirata as a "transient, moving in and out with
tidal, daily, and seasonal change". Dayton (1971) and Connell (1970), in eluciÂ¬
dating the extent to which Nucella species in the Olympic Penninsula Region
affect populations of barnacles, also remark on the movement of predatory gas-
tropods with the tide.
Yet casual observation seemed to indicate that there were qualitative
and quantitative differences between the predatory snail populations of Pacific
Grove and those of Washington (Dayton,1971 and Connell, 1970), Millport (Connell,
1961), and the Santa Cruz Islands (Menge, 1974). In fact, it was not immediately
clear what exactly was the situation at hand at all. It had not been the focus
of previous research at Hopkins Marine Station to illuminate population charac-
teristics of predatory snails, although anecdotal observations along these lines
were recorded. (Glynn, 1965 and Sleder, 1981). Thus it was in an investigative
spirit, clipboard and wetsuit in hand, that this study was undertaken to charac-
terize the spatial and temporal distributions of Acanthina; specifically, to
determine in what habitats, engaged in which activities, in what numbers, and
