Mita, R.T.
at any given time and about two-thirds of these turned over from one low tide to
the next, then the residency on faces was 0.75 day and the time spent in refuges
was 1.5 days. However, a group of 5 snails was once observed to spend 19 days
semi-buried beneath sand in a crevice, so the stay can evidently be quite variable.
A quick survey of feeding Acanthina revealed that the vast majority were
preying on Balanus glandula. Far fewer numbered those eating Chthamalus dalli,
with snails feeding on Tetraclita rubescens (Darwin, 1854) and Littorina scutulata
very infrequently encountered. (figure 8)
