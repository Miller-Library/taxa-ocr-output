DISCUSSION
Differences between high and low tide snail activity exist. Snails
which are not in refuges are more active and more numerous at high tide. This
is most noticeable at the upper range of their distribution, where all individuals
on rock faces are either feeding or moving at high tide, whereas at low tide such
individuals are only sitting still. If the aerial extension and use of the locoÂ¬
motory and feeding organs entails an evaporative loss, then the selective advan-
tage in restricting such activity to periods of reduced dessicati on potential
is apparent. Another possible and/or contributing explanation for this pattern
may be that if water-borne chemosensory cues are used by Acanthina in the location
of prey items, then foraging would be facilitated and thnerefore more apt to
occur during periods of submersion. While it is premature to make definitive
claims as to the reason, it is evident that sampling only at low tides cannot in
itself provide a representative view of the population, yet most intertidal work
is based on low tide observations.
One might make an indirect calculation of prey handling times in the field
from this data. Since all prey caught in the uppermost level were barnacles and
no feeding was ever recorded at this height during a low tide, the maximum time
required to process a barnacle under these conditions was less than about twelve
hours (the length of time between successive low tides). Insofar as the minimum
handling time is concerned, an approximate upper limit can be obtained from noting
that some individuals were seen feeding in only one survey, but not in those
immediately precedingor following. Surveys were made at tides and mid-tides, so
