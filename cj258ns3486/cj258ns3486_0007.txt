RESULTS
Rhodamine Assays:
The embryos incubated with 1 uM rhodamine plus 22uM
verapamil have average fluorescence levels that are 15.6% higher
than those embryos incubated in only MFSW and rhodamine. This
percentage is a measure of the effect of verapamil on MXR activity.
The embryos incubated in luM rhodamine plus 25 ul of sediment
extract fluoresced an average of 11.65% more than the embryos
that were incubated in only MFSW plus rhodamine. This indicates
that there are substrates for MDR in the sediment, but that they are
not in as high a concentration as the 22uM verapamil substrate.
One should also note that the intensity of fluorescence for the
sediment extract varied from 5.5% to 17.8%, indicating that the
levels of substrates in the sediment are not constant.
S. purpuratus Developmental Assays:
The embryos incubated in pore water, or water taken from the
sediment after centrifugation, averaged 51.8% more abnormalities
than the embryos that developed in MFSW. It is believed that this
high level of abnormalities in the pore water can be attributed to the
combinatory effect of toxins in the pore water, and the lack of an
MXR protein to protect the sea urchin embryos. Less clear results
were found in the developmental assay done with a sediment
