MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult Urechis caupo were collected at the mud flats in Moss
Landing, CA on two different dates, April 9, 1993 or May 28, 1993.
The worms were maintained in tanks with a constant source of fresh
sea water. Urechis were spawned, and the eggs were fertilized
according to Gould (9). Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were
collected at Point Arena, CA, and they were maintained with a
constant flow of fresh sea water according to Czihak and Peter (10).
For the rhodamine fluorescence assays 10 ul of 1mM
rhodamine B was added to 10 ml of eggs, which made a final
concentration of luM. The eggs were divided into 2 test tubes of 5
ml each, and either 22pM of verapamil or 25 ul of sediment extract
was added to one of the test tubes. The embryos were incubated for
one hour at 16’C. The eggs were then washed into filtered sea
water and the fluorescence was measured using a Zeiss
epifluorescence microscope fitted with a photosensor. The light
emitted by the embryos was expressed by a voltmeter as relative
fluorescence units.
For the developmental assays the eggs were fertilized in type
GS.22um millipore filtered sea water (MFSW) and incubated in their
respective solutions at 16’C. These solutions were combinations of
the following: MFSW, pore water, verapamil (.022 uM or .044 uM),
rhodamine B (1.25 uM), and emetine (.0025 uM or .005 uM). In
cases where pore water was used, it was used in equal amounts with
