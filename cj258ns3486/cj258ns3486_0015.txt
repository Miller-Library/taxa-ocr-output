Figure 1. Rhodamine fluorescence vs. incubation solution. The first
column represents eggs that were incubated in only rhodamine dye,
and the second column represents eggs that were incubated with
rhodamine dye plus verapamil for the same amount of time. The
third column is the same as the first, just rhodamine dye incubation,
and the last one represents an incubation of rhodamine dye and
sediment extract.
Figure 2. Rhodamine fluorescence vs. incubation solution. The first
column represents eggs that were incubated in only rhodamine dye,
and the second column represents eggs that were incubated with
rhodamine dye plus verapamil for the same amount of time. The
third column is the same as the first, just rhodamine dye incubation,
and the last one represents an incubation of rhodamine dye plus
sediment extract.
Figure 3. Examples of normal and abnormal development in S.
purpuratus. The photographs were taken at the 16 cell stage of
embryos from the same batch of eggs. The normal embryo was
developing in MFSW, and the abnormal embryo, which exhibits
delayed cell cleavage, was developing in pore water.
Figure 4. Developmental assay with % abnormal plotted against time
in hours after fertilization. There is little difference between the
lines for the sediment extract and the ethanol, indicating that the
ethanol was affecting development.
Figure 5. Examples of normal and abnormal development in Urechis
caupo embryos. The photographs were taken at the swimming
trocophore stage of embryos from the same batch of eggs. The
