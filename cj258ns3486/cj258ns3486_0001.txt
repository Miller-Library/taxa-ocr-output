ABSTRACT
The echluroid worm Urechis caupo is one of the many marine
invertebrates that is able to live and reproduce in a polluted
environment. One proposed explanation for this worm's resistance
to pollutants is the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanism,
whereby a protein in the cell membrane pumps a wide variety of
moderately hydrophobic compounds out of the cells. This protein is
analogous to multidrug resistance (MDR) in mammalian cells which
provides mammalian cells with multidrug resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents. These data support the role of MXR as a
protective mechanism for marine invertebrates, suggest bioassays
for pollutants, and propose that the phenomenons of hormesis and
multixenobiotic resistance are related.
