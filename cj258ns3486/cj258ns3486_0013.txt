ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank my advisor Dr. David Epel for sharing his
wonderful enthusiasm for development, and his valuable insights
into my project. Sincere thanks also go to Barbara Holland Toomey,
for taking the time and patience to share her knowledge of
multixenobiotic resistance in Urechis caupo, and the methods for
studying this phenomenon. Thanks to Chris Patton for his technical
assistance, as well as his "pre-med munchkin" jokes. Finally, I would
like to thank my colleague Joyce Chen, whose wit and
encouragement made an adventure out of the long days in lab.
