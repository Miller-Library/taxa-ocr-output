in only pore water. This result led to the idea that the phenomenon
of hormesis is related to the activity of MXR.
U. caupo Developmental Assays with Emetine (0025 uM or
005 UM):
The embryos that developed in pore water plus .0025 uM of
emetine averaged only 3.6% more abnormalities than did the
embryos that developed in MFSW plus an equal concentration of
emetine. However, when the concentration of emetine was doubled,
those embryos that were incubated in pore water plus emetine
averaged 19% more abnormalities than did those embryos that were
incubated in only MFSW plus emetine. As in the developmental
assay with verapamil, the levels of abnormalities for all the embryos
increased after the sixth cleavage. More importantly, by the sixth
cleavage the % abnormal for the embryos in the MFSW was higher
than it was for those developing in only pore water, which provides
further evidence for hormesis.
U. caupo Developmental Assay with Rhodamine B (1.25
UM:
The embryos that developed in pore water plus 1.25 uM of
rhodamine averaged 8.8% more abnormalities than those embryos
that developed in MFSW plus the same concentration of rhodamine.
As in the previous assays with Urechis, those embryos that
developed in only MFSW eventually averaged a higher % abnormality
