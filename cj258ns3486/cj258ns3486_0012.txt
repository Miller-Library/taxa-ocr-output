Furthermore, it seems that rhodamine B may be used instead of
verapamil as a competitive inhibitor of MXR, because it is less toxic
and it is a known substrate of the MXR protein. These assays could
potentially become important methods of environmental xenobioticÂ¬
risk assessment and toxicology; especially in the case where the
effect of a specific toxin on development is known and can be
detected in embryos developing under the influence of a known
competitive inhibitor of the MXR protein.
Perhaps the most interesting and novel results in this project
are those that provide evidence for the phenomenon of hormesis
occurring in developing Urechis embryos. Hormesis is the condition
where low levels of a toxin stimulate a stress response in an
organism which instills, in that organism, some form of beneficial
effect(8). The lower numbers of abnormal embryos developing in
pore water than those developing in MFSW are evidence of hormesis.
However, further study is necessary to determine if the form of
hormesis that is occurring involves induction or activation of higher
levels of the MXR protein. If the levels of toxins in the environment
of Urechis caupo are affecting the expression or activation of the
MXR protein, then measurements of this protein may one day be
used as biomarkers of water pollution.
