extract. The sediment extract was made by evaporating with
chloroform: methanol (2:1), and then dissolving the residue in
ethanol. Although the embryos that were incubated in sediment
extract averaged 59.7% higher abnormalities than those that
developed in only MFSW, the control embryos that were incubated
in an equal amount of ethanol also had very high abnormality,
which indicates that the ethanol was affecting development. The
numbers for S. purpuratus and Urechis developmental assays were
calculated by taking the average number of abnormalities in each
group, subtracting the difference between the two groups being
compared, and multiplying that number by 100 to get the %
abnormality.
U. caupo Developmental Assays with Verapamil 022 UM
Or.044 UM):
The first assay done with .022 uM of verapamil showed a
difference of only .66% between the average abnormality level of
the embryos developing in pore water plus verapamil and those
embryos developing in MFSW plus verapamil. However, when the
concentration of verapamil was doubled to .044 uM the difference
in abnormality levels increased to 18%. It is important to note that
after the sixth cleavage the controls of only verapamil increase in
abnormalities until they have a higher % abnormal than the
experimentals. One should also note that the % abnormal for the
embryos in the MFSW is higher than it is for the embryos developing
