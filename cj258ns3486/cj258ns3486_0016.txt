normal embryo was developing in MFSW, and the abnormal embryo
was developing in pore water plus .044 uM verapamil.
Figure 6. Developmental assay with % abnormal plotted against the
cleavage stage for normally developing embryos as determined by
Newby (11).
Figure 7. Experiment was done and graphed in the same way as the
experiment in figure 3, except that the concentration of verapamil
was doubled.
Figure 8. Developmental assay with % abnormal plotted against the
cleavage stage for embryos with normal development.
Figure 9. Experiment was done and graphed in the same way as the
experiment in figure 5, except that the concentration of emetine was
doubled.
Figure 10. Developmental assay with % abnormal plotted against the
cleavage stage for embry√∂s with normal development.
