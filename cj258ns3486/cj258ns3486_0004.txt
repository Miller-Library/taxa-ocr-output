that is exposed to non-toxic levels of a toxin (8). I also found
evidence which suggests that verapamil is toxic at very low levels
(.022 uM), and that this compound would give misleading results
when used as a competitive substrate in developmental assays. On
the other hand, my work suggests that rhodamine B might be a
useful competitive substrate in developmental assays, because it is a
known substrate of the MXR protein and it is less toxic than
verapamil.
