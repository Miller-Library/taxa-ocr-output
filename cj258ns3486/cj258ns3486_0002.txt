INTRODUCTION
Multidrug resistance, or multixenobiotic resistance, is one
phenomenon that is responsible for both the resistance of tumor
cells to chemotherapy drugs, and the ability of marine organisms to
survive in highly polluted habitats. This resistance is believed to be
directly related to levels of expression of the MDR protein in
mammals, and to an immunologically related protein of 140-145 KD
in marine invertebrates (1). For a protein with such diverse effects
as are created by MDR, one can easily imagine the importance of
scientific research of MXR to the fields of medicine, toxicology, and
marine biology.
The MDR protein is a transmembrane protein of 1280 amino
acids with two equivalent ATP binding sites, only one of which must
be occupied for transport (2). A protein immunologically related to
the MDR protein in mammals has been shown to exist in the
echiuroid worm Urechis caupo (3) which lives and reproduces in UÂ¬
shaped burrows in the mud flats at Moss Landing. Urechis uses
peristaltic contractions of its muscular body to move water through
the burrows, thereby replenishing food and oxygen, and removing
wastes that have seeped in from the surrounding sediment. Previous
studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide, a highly toxic compound,
can also accumulate in sediments of shallow marine bays such as the
Elkhorn Slough at Moss Landing (4).
