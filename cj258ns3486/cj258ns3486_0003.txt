In this study I assessed MR activity using rhodamine
fluorescence assays which measure the accumulation of rhodamine
dye, a substrate of the mammalian multidrug transporter (5).
Urechis embryos incubated with rhodamine and a competitive
inhibitor of the MXR protein fluoresce more brightly than embryos
in the dye alone. Verapamil is a potent inhibitor of the MDR protein
(6,7) and it was used as a known inhibitor in the rhodamine assays.
The second part of this study asked whether MDR activity can
protect embryos that develop in supposedly polluted sediment water
or in the presence of known cytotoxic compounds. For this study I
devised an assay in which Urechis caupo embryos or
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos are allowed to develop in
sediment pore water in the presence, or absence of an MXR
inhibitor. If compounds that are substrates for the MXR protein are
present in the pore water, competition between those substrates and
the NXR inhibitor would result in higher levels of substrates inside
the cells and, possibly, abnormal development.
Through the use of these two methods, I investigated the
presence of substrates for the MXR protein in sediment from Moss
Landing. In addition the effectiveness of various chemicals as
competitive inhibitors of MXR in the developmental assay, and the
effects of sediment on the development of Urechis caupo and
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos were determined.
The results of this work revealed the phenomenon of
hormesis, in which a stress response is stimulated in an organism
