DISCUSSION
In this study and previous studies (3), it has been shown that
the efflux of rhodamine B dye is decreased in the presence of pore
water or extractions of sediment collected from the mud flats at
Moss Landing. Based on rhodamine fluorescence assays that I have
done, which reveal varying degrees of rhodamine efflux inhibition, it
is possible to conclude that although there is indirect evidence of
MXR substrates in the sediment, the levels of these substrates vary.
These different levels may be depend on the time of day or of year
that the sediment is collected, the location of the sediment, the
biological make-up of the sediment and/or the size of the sediment
grains.
The developmental assays done with Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus provide evidence that toxic substrates for the MXR
protein exist in the sediment collected from Moss Landing. S.
purpuratus has been shown to lack the MXR protein (3), and this
species of sea urchin develops abnormally in the sediment which
Urechis caupo inhabits. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that
the abnormal development in S. purpuratus is due to the absence of
MXR in this species of sea urchin, and that MXR is a protective
mechanism for inhabitants of the Moss Landing mud flats.
The developmental assays done with Urechis demonstrate that
the use of verapamil as a competitive substrate should be avoided
due to its toxic effects at concentrations as low as .022 uM.
