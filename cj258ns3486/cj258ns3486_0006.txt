the MFSW. Pore water was removed from the sediment by
vigorously shaking it for two minutes, and centrifuging it at high
speed for one minute. To reduce water loss by evaporation, the
beakers containing the Urechis embryos were partially covered with
Parafilm, whereas the S. purpuratus embryos were constantly stirred
to prevent crowding and anoxia. At the designated times an aliquot
of embryos was removed, inspected for abnormalities under the
microscope, counted and discarded. If the embryos had hatched
they were fixed with one drop of 37% formaldehyde before counting
and inspection.
Abnormal development for sea urchin embryos included
delayed cleavage, lysed cells, disorganized cells, exogastrulation,
and little or no movement compared to controls. In the
developmental assay for Urechis, abnormal development was based
on the same crit√©ria, except that once the embryos were swimming,
continuous spinning to only one side was considered abnormal, in
addition to little movement compared to controls.
Sediment samples were collected at Moss Landing, at the site
of adult worm collection. They were frozen at -80 C within one
hour of collection, and thawed prior to use. For some experiments
extractions from the pore water, or directly from the sediment were
done by mixing with chloroform:methanol (2:1). The solvent phase
was removed to a clean tube and evaporated. The remaining residue
was dissolved into 200 ul of 95% ethanol and used in the rhodamine
or development assays.
