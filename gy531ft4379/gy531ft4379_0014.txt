efficient utilization of an ephemeral food supply as Carey suggests. Faster digestion also means
faster fat absorption. This speed in absorption will allow more frequent feeding, increasing the
supply of lipid to the liver. These lipids can either be stored for future use or mobilized in order
to fuel the powerful swimming muscles that allow the tuna to be great predators.
Assays of lipid oxidation within the caecum will prove useful for further study. Now
that it is clear that heat is being produced metabolically, the source of the remaining heat cannot
be elusive for long. Further injections performed on yellowfin and blackfin may lead to a more
complete injection, and injections on other species of tuna will determine whether countercurrent
heat exchange is possible throughout the genus.
Conclusion
The presence of countercurrent heat exchanging architecture within the caecum of the
vellowfin tuna along with a high degree of aerobic activity contributing to heat production
indicates a model for heat conservation within the tuna caecum. Similar anatomy within the
blackfin tuna suggests that this model is not confined to the yellowfin and may be present in all
species of tuna.
