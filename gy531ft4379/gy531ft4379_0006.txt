Histology
Caecal tissues from yellowfin and blackfin were removed from fish shortly after death,
fixed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin, sectioned, stained with Masson's Trichrome, and
prepared on a slide for light microscopy.
CS Assays
Assays were performed on one caecum and liver sample from each of seven yellowfin, as
well as two caecum samples from blackfin tuna (they were not the same fish that were used for
injection). All tissues were stored in a-80°C freezer prior to use in assays. Tissue specimens
were weighed in 0.2-0.3 g wet weight portions. Removal of fatty tissue from caecal tissues was
not attempted due to the high fat content of the caecum. Upon thawing, tissues generally lost
0.1g of water weight. The tissue was then minced on an ice cold stage, and extraction buffer
added to achieve a 1:10 dilution. Extraction medium consisted of 40 mM Hepes, ImM EDTA,
and 2mM MgCl2, pH 7.98 020°C. The mixture was then homogenized in a ground glass
homogenizer. The homogenate was sonicated in two 15 second bursts with a 30 second break in
between, and the final dilution was performed by adding more extraction buffer. Dilutions were
1:50 for caecum samples and 1:33 for liver.
Assays were performed at 25°C using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 6 spectrophotometer at
412nm. Activity was measured as micro moles of DTNB reduced per minute (Tullis, et al.
1991). Each homogenate was assayed 6 replicate times.
Statistics
A single factor ANOVA was run for caecum and liver citrate synthase activities between
the seven sampled fish. The same was done for the blackfin caecum CS activities. A pe.05 was
considered to be significant. A regression plot of CS activity as a function of animal mass was
also run to test for a correlation.
