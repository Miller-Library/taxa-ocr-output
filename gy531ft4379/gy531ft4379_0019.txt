of a caecum pyloric finger. (D) Caecum pyloric finger viewed at lOx magnification.
Fig. 9. Illustration of the blackfin, Thunnus atlanticus, viscera with the vasculature of the
stomach and caecum.

cavity. (B) Close-up of caecum rete and arterial connections to the stomach. (C) Arterioles of

Caecum pyloric fingers viewed at lOx magnification. (B) 40x close-up of epithelial extension in
the lumen of a pyloric finger. (C) Caecum rete at lOx magnification.
Fig, 12. Illustrations of bonito viscera and caecum. (A) Layout of viscera and relationship
between the organs. (B) Caecum with extensive vasculature.
Fig. 13. (A) Citrate synthase activities for caecum and liver tissues of seven yellowfin tuna.
Caecum is in gray and liver is in yellow. A single factor ANOVA shows significant differences
between the value for each fish. (B) Fish mass plotted against caecum CS activity. A regression
plot shows no significant correlation.
