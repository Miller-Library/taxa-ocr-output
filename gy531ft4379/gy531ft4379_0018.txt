Fig. 1. (A) Arrow indicates the ventral stomach rete connecting the caecum and the stomach.
Venous injection site for YFTI and YFT4. (B) Arterial injection of YFT4. Left operculum is
removed to reveal the gills, and catheter is inserted into the posterior epibranchial of the gills.
(C) Arterial injection of BLK1. Catheter is inserted into the lateral cutaneous artery via a small
window in the muscle.
Fig. 2, Illustrations of the yellowfin, Thunnus albacares, viscera. (A) Organs are shown as they
relate to each other in the peritoneal cavity and major stomach vessels are drawn in purple. (B)
Illustration of the branches of the coeliac artery and their destinations in the viscera.
Fig. 3. (A) View of the yellowfin viscera as it lies in the peritoneal cavity. Muscle has been
removed ventrally to reveal the organs. Caecum is located in the lower left of the cavity. (B)
Digital photo of the yellowfin caecum depicting the arrangement of pyloric fingers within the
organ.
Fig. 4. Block diagram of the arterial (red) and venous (blue) blood supply to the visceral organs
of yellowfin, and blackfin, Thunnus atlanticus.
Fig. 5. Uninjected yellowfin caecum rete. Dark red area shows rete on dorsal surface of the
caecum.
Fig. 6. Venous blood flow within the yellowfin caecum. (A) Injection of venules (blue) between
the pyloric fingers (white) of the caecum. 4.Ox magnification. (B) Cross-section of the caecum
rete. The two white tubes in the top left corner are the pyloric tubules bringing in food from the
stomach. There is no caecal tissue within the rete, only blood vessels. 2.5x magnification. (C)
Close-up of caecum rete. Same location as 6b. I.Ox magnification.
Fig. 7. Double injection of YFT4. Red denotes arteries and blue denotes veins. (A) Cross¬
section of caecum rete. 2.5x magnification. (B) View of the two main arteries supplying the
caecum. Both are surrounded by blue venous blood. 0.63x magnification.
