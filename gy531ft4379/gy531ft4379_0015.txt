Acknowledgments
Many thanks to my advisor, Dr. Barbara Block, who always demonstrated enormous
enthusiasm for my project. She spent countless hours assisting me on injections and giving me
advice when things didnâ€™t work out quite the way I had expected. Without her support, the
mysteries of the caecum would still lie uncovered to this day. Thanks to the entire Block lab,
whose willingness to help with any problem made life as an undergraduate that much easier.
Thanks to Dr. Tom Williams for helping me to ask all the right questions about the caecum.
Thanks to Dr. Heidi Dewar, for her constant encouragement and interest in my progress, and for
her help with my paper. Special thanks to Ellen Freund, for lending me an extra set of hands
when they were needed and for being the first person who dared to read my paper. Thanks to
Daniel Lau for helping me with those pesky computers and for being my chauffeur. Thanks to
David Marcinek for allowing me to impede his progress toward his thesis by answering all my
questions all the time. Thanks also to Alex Nelson for always being the smiling face that made
me look forward to doing enzyme assays. Thanks to Simon Fletcher for leading me through
those first few weeks. Thanks to Meghan for keeping me company in the Carey lab and for
letting me listen to the same awful music over and over again. Thanks also to Jim Watanabe for
his statistical insights. Finally, enormous thanks to my housemates at 801 Terry St. who have
made this one of the best quarters of my Stanford career.
