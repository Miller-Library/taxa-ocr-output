Leaks were clamped with hemostats or blotted with gauze. Silicon compound was then pushed
through using gentle hand pressure on a 10 ml syringe. Injection continued until applied
pressure became too great or until all the injectant was used. Sites of injection and amounts of
injectant varied as techniques were developed. Table 1 outlines the sites and amounts of
injection in each fish.

* Only successful double injection
The double injection of YFTI began with the venous injection. For YFT2, the arterial
side was injected first, followed by the venous side. YFT3 began with the venous injection
followed by the arterial injection. For YFT4, the arterial side was injected, followed by the
venous side. Finally, for BLKI the arterial side was injected first, followed by the venous side.
Following injection, viscera were excised from each fish and fixed in 10% phosphate
buffered formalin. Viscera were studied intact first, following the path of the coeliac artery, then
caeca were separated from the remainder of the viscera, sectioned, and viewed under a Leica
dissecting scope.
