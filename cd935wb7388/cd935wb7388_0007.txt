conducting medium. The petri dish and lid were sealed with 5 minute epoxy
with the Ag/AgCl wire running from the inside of the dish over the edge of
the dish to the outside. In order to minimize the possibility of current
flowing around the skin through the sea water instead of through the skin
the tissue was pat dry with kimwipes until no wetness was visible and
briefly air dried with an aquarium aerator. Both lids were covered with
vaseline to form a tight seal to the skin to prevent water leakage and to
further impede current flow around the skin. Before placing the skin onto
the vaseline covered bottom electrode, enough sea water was added to
insure that the meniscus would contact the skin. The bottom electrode aiso
served as a stage to lay the skin upon. To control for inconsistencies in how
far the skin was stretched, I measured the area of the skin before removing
it and stretched the skin once on the stage to the measured area. The other
lid, with vaseline on the base, was placed on top of the skin, pressed down
until the skin bulged slightly in the center hole to further insure good water
contact, then the Ag/AgCl wire was placed in the upper lid and the lid filled
with sea water.
Unfortunately, the Ag/AgCl wires often polarized, so it was difficult to
obtain valid measurements. The criteria used for determining whether the
data was valid was whether the electrodes had drifted significantly during
the skin measurements. To determine this I measured the Relectrode before
and after measuring Rekin- Skin measurements were considered valid if the
electrodes had drifted less than 5.0 2 of the original resistance.
Only the epithelial tissue was used in resistivity experiments. Valid
data included pulses of 10.9 mV, 100 mV and 100.7 mV across dorsal electric
organ skin, and 100 mV and 101.5 mV across ventral electric organ skin.
Puises lasted 5.00 seconds in order to measure the steady component of the
