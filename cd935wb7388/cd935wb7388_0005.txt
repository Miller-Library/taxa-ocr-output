MATERIALS AND METHOD
Nine rays were obtained in 30-40 feet of water off Wharf 2 in
Monterey Bay. Five of these (including the one we used for conditioning
were kept in a tank shielded from sunlight by a tarp in order to approximate
the dim lighting conditions at their usual depth. The five rays used to
measure skin resistance were stunned with an ice/sea water bath and killed
by decerebration. One ray was killed with an overdose of quinaldine
anesthetic (208 quinaldine in isopropyl alcohol). Two were found dead, the
probable cause of death being nitrogen gas bubbles in their tissue.
Dissection:
Standard dissecting tools were used, aided by a Bausch and Lomb dissecting
microscope. Dissected samples were kept in a solution of 508 sand filtered
sea water and 508 tap water.
Skin Resistance:
A Grass DC stimulator was used as the voltage source. Recordings were
amplified by 10X and then recorded on a Nicolet digital oscilloscope. The
apparatus (figure 2) was arranged with the voltage source grounded on one
side and two resistances in series to the circuit. The first resistance (Ki) was
exactiy 100 kohms and the second resistance (R2) was unknown. The
measuring electrode from the oscilloscope was placed between the two
resistances. Rz was calculated using the following equation.
R2 - (Ri * Vout) / (Vin - V out)
