ABSTRACT
This paper explores three aspects of the Pacific electric ray Torpedo
californica: the basic anatomy of this fish, how the torpedo insulates itself
from its own shock, and whether the torpedo's electroreception can be used
as à tool for learning. Using anatomical observations and skin resistance
méasurements, I set out to determine whether the torpedo's skin was
different over the electric organs and non electric organ areas and how the
torpedo insulates itself. I could find no difference in appearance, texture or
color from the electric organ to non electric organ. I did, however, find that
thère are many more layers of connective tissue over and under non electric
organ areas than over the electric organs. Furthermore, I measured the
dorsal skin to have roughly twice the resistivity as ventral skin. I believe
that the other important insulation tactics are use of cartilege to protect the
brain, heart and nerves, connective tissue to protect peripheral nerves, and
placement of muscles as far from the electric organs as possible. I have also
described the placement of the ampullae of Lorenzini and applied Pavlovian
conditioning techniques using the ampullae. During the time we tried to
condition the torpedo, it was not responsive.
INTPODUCTION
The torpedo is a nocturnal fish that spends most of its time lying on
the bottom of the subtidal zone under a loose covering of sand or mud.
Although the torpedo looks similar to many rays and skates, internally they
are quite different from their non-electric relatives. The two large electric
organs comprise 228 of the body mass and 322 of the surface area in the
torpedo. Thus, this ray has become highly specialized to accomodate the
large size of these organs and to insulate themselves from their own shock.
