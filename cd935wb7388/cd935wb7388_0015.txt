connective tissue needs to be measured to determine whether it is actually
the amazing insulator I think it is.
Our attempts to conditioning our torpedo using its electroreception
were not successful, but this does not mean that its electric sense is weak or
intermittent, or that the torpedo is dumb. There were several problems with
our setup. First was the fact that the wing stomp was an undesirable
stimulus. As the training time wore on each day, the ray's liklihood of
responding to a wing stomp with a discharge decreased. This pattern could
show habituation to the wing stomp, which was exactly what we did not
want. Second, if there was habituation, our results were further skewed by
our testing the unconditioned response towards the end of the hour. Third,
we may not have persisted with the training for long enough. A better
experiment would be to use a positive unconditioned stimulus such as a good
food. This is difficult because torpedos are not very receptive to anything
but lying on the bottom of the tank covered with sand.
Further directions for research:
On the topic of insulation, it would be interesting to see if the relative
thickness of fibrous tissue surrounding nerve fiber decreases farther away
from the electric organs, as the fibrous tissue on muscle seems to. This could
be done by again embedding the tissue in wax and cutting sections to be
viewed under a powerful light microscope. The connective tissue, especially
the fibrous tissue, the jelly tube tissue, and the tissue at the snout of the
torpedo, needs to be further characterized using histological techniques to
stain for collagen fiber organization and biochemical structure.
Unfortunately, time did not permit comparison of the torpedos
musculature and connective tissue to that of its non electric relatives. This
