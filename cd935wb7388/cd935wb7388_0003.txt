Torpedo discharges can be as powerful as 50 volts and 50 amps, or 2,500
Watts (Keynes and Martins-Ferreira). The small rays in the Monterey bay
subtidal have a much smaller discharge but even so, this shock is powerful
Ã©nough to stun a prey fish at close range or issue a warning to a predator
(Fong). The electric field applied by the torpedo on a victim upsets the
delicate electrochemical balance that controis the victim's nerves and
muscles, rendering the victim helpless as his nerves fire and muscles
contract.
While the electric organ is not discharging, the dorsal and ventral
faces of the electric organ are at the same potential. During discharge, the
ventral face depolarizes creating an electric field (figure 1). High ion
concentration gives sea water low resistance and high conductivity,
therefore, most of the current generated will travel the least resistive
pathway from one face, through the water, around the wing tip to the other
face as illustrated by the dark field lines (figure 1). Some current must
travel the longer alternate pathways through the water as illustrated by the
lighter field lines. Finally, since the body fluid of the torpedo also has high
ion concentration there is the probability that some current could travel
through the inside of the body and wreak internal havoc. How does the
torpedo protect itself from its own discharge? To answer this question I
performed several dissections and developed a system for measuring skin
resistance. I set out to test the hypothesis that skin above and below the
electric organs would be of low resistance to permit easy current flow and
the rest of the skin would be highly resistive for insulation. I found that the
torpedo uses three primary tactics to insulate itself; layering of connective
tissue, use of cartilege, and strategic placement of nerves and muscles.
