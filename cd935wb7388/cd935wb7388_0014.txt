connective tissue, this would show the potential value of fibrous connective
tissue as a powerful insulator.
The results of the skin resistance experiment show that dorsal skin
has about double the resistivity of ventral skin. This may be partially due to
the less than ideal accuracy of the calipers that were used to measure skin
thickness. The dorsal skin is probably still more resistive than the ventral
skin, even allowing for some inaccuracy in thickness measurements. This is
curious, the torpedo does not endanger its dorsal side more than its ventral
side during discharge (figure 1b) Nor is it likely that the torpedo has
developed a passive defense mechanism to guard against the electrical
onslaught of other electric fish, stray lightening bolts, or live wires thrown
into their environment by careless humans. Instead, the difference in
resistivity between dorsal and ventral skin might be explained by entirely
different factors such as the resistive properties of the black pigment cells
that cover the torpedo on its dorsal side. Maybe the dorsal side has tighter
packing of cells for better thermal insulation since the torpedo spends most
of its time on the muddy bottom, and water conducts heat away from the
body faster than mud. Or other reasons than these.
More accurate measurements of skin thickness need to be made,
perhaps by embedding a section of tissue in wax and taking a longitudinal
slice with a sharp razor or vibratome. Once better thickness measurements
are available, better discussion of the inherent properties of the tissue will
be possible. More data needs to be collected on skin resistance, particularly
on skin from different areas of the body. The original hypothesis of whether
or not skin covering the electric organs has different resistance than other
skin still needs to be tested rigorously. And, the resistance of the fibrous
