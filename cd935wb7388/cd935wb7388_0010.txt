Also, the nerves that encircle the electric organ run through the cartilege
frame of the electirc organ.
Musde Hber: The heart is an organ particularly sensitive to electrical
activity. It is encased on all sides by the cartilege skeleton that provides
excellent insulation. Other muscle on the body is sequestered away from the
électric organs. The torpedo is not a muscular animal. The electric organs
are composed of modified muscle but they do not contract and release
Electric organ muscle fibers are arranged into vertical colunns, and the
tendons that normally link muscle to cartilege are absent. Non-electric organ
muscle is carefully placed and insulated with varying degrees of connective
tissue. Thère is no trace of non-electric organ muscle above or below the
electric organs. Non-electric organ muscle is dense down the central axis of
the body and more sparse on the fins (figure 8). Near the electric organs
thère is a muscle beneath the mouth that mediates mouth movement. There
are two muscles that run from between the electric organ and the dorsal
nostril and connect to the horizontal bar of cartilege in the center of the
torpedo. The fin muscle is thicker at the base of the fin than it is at the tip
and the muscle is thicker on the fins at the posterior end of the fish than at
the anterior end.
Connective tissue plays an important role in insulating muscle
Above and below the electric organ there is a layer of epithelial tissue and
one layer of fibrous connective tissue. The dorsal epithelium seemed
constant all over the dorsal side, and the ventral epithelium seemed constant
all over the ventral side of the body. There was no noticable difference
between epithelium over the electric organs and on the rest of the body.
The difference between the covering of the electric organs and of the rest of
the body is the layering of connective tissue. The rest of the body is
