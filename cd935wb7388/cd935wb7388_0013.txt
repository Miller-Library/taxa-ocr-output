graceful sweeps of the wings as its nimble skate and ray relatives can.
Instead, it swings its tail back and forth for a very slow and awkward mode
of locomotion (figure 12).
The idea that the external skin of the torpedo is the key factor in
insulation seems false in light of observations from the dissection. Instead,
what seems to be most important to torpedo insulation are the layering of
connective tissue below the epithelial layer, clever use of cartilege and
careful placement of muscle.
Cartilege is probably the best insulating tissue in the torpedo, its
resistance being close to infinite. Current is conducted through tissue
because of the availability and mobility of ions from the torpedos high-
osmolarity body fluids. Epithelial and connective tissue are far more fluid¬
saturated than cartilege, this might explain its high resistivity to elective
flow. The torpedo's body takes advantage of the insulating properties of
cartilege by shielding the brain, heart, spinal cord and some peripheral
nerves from the electric field evolved during the discharge
The careful placement of connective tissue is important in general
body insulation. It is placed beneath the epithelial skin on non electric organ
areas of the body and insulates specific sensitive structures like peripheral
nerves and muscles especially close to the electric organs.
The jelly tubes from the ampullae of Lorenzini run along the
periphery of the electric organ in a thin layer of loose connective tissue. Each
tube contains a highly conductive mucopolysaccharide jelly bounded by
connective tissué that could be of the fibrous breed. Fish that give off a
constant low grade electric discharge have ampullae that are not affected by
the fish's own electric organ discharge (Suga). If the tubing is indeed fibrous
