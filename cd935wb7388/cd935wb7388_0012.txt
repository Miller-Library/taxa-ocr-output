anterior end of the torpedo end in bulb cluster I, which is surrounded by
loose connective tissue. The ampullae that begin around the lateral
periphery of the electric organ lead to bulb cluster II which lies between the
electric organ and cartilege. The afferent nerves from the ampullar bulbs
are concentrated into a few fibers (figure 5). These nerves do connect to the
lateral line system, but it would be entirely possible to sever only the
ampullar nerves to perform a sensory denervation for behavioral studies.
conditioning: In the time we spent trying to condition the torpedo, it
did not seem to condition to the electric stimulus as a cue to discharge. The
torpedo did discharge for about 703 of the wing stomps. The other 302
resulted from 1. wing stomps that missed because the ray was swimming
(202), 2. the ray not discharging towards the end of the one hour sessions
(53) or 3. for no obvious reason (52). Of the many times we attempted to
solicit the unconditioned response only once did we observe a discharge.
DISCUSSION
The ability to generate electric shocks gives the torpedo a definite
advantage out in the ocean, but this is not without cost. The electric organ
muscle fiber, as arranged into vertical columns with no tendon structure, is
quite useless for movement. The electric organ goes all the way through the
width of the torpedo, with no other structures intervening. This is in
contrast to non-electric skates and rays where the area occupied by the
electric organ is composed of cartilagenous fin rays and muscle to form the
pectoral fins (Daniel). Furthermore, the cartilege fins at the most anterior
1/4 of the body are continuous with the cartil√®ge around the electric organ
The lack of a joint at the fin junction inhibits movement even more. Thus
the torpedo is a rather clumsy creature unable to propell itself along with
