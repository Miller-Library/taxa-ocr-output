comparison would show whether the connective tissue that seems to serve
the purpose of insulation in the torpedo was actually evolved for that
specific purpose.
On the topic of electroreception, I hope that my map of the ampullae
of Lorenzini will prove useful to someone able to pursue the topic, especially
since the only remotely similar map of ampullae was in the skate Kaya and
its ampulsar distrubution is quite different from the torpedo's. Several types
of desensitization experiments are possible for studying the behavioral uses
of electroreception without cutting off the lateral line system. Selective
denervation is definitely possible but not simple. An alternative method
would be to destroy the ampullar bulbs with four incisions, one above each
bulb cluster. Another possibility would be to cut the jelly tubes just
posterior to the bulb clusters. More humane experiments could use Kalmijn's
chambers of ion concentrated agar to conceal stimuli visually, chemically and
mechanically without disturbing the bioelectric field.
