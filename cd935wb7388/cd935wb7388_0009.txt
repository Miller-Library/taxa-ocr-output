Dissection:
An orientation to the anatomy is shown in a ventral view of internal
organs (figure 4), a dorsal view of internal organs and central nervous
system (figure 5), and the cartilege skeleton of the torpedo (figure 6). The
sex of the torpedo (figure 7) can be identified by the presence of claspers at
the ventral base of the male's tail.
From dissection, we find that specific structures (the central nervous
system, peripheral nerves, heart and muscle) that are highly sensitive to
electrical stimuli use cartilege, connective tissue and careful placement to
mitigate the internal effect of the discharge.
Central Nervous System. The brain and spinal cord are enclosed by
cartilege shells (figure 6). In certain areas the cartilege shell has two layers
seperated by a fluid pocket. There are three pockets (shown in blue in
figure 6). The first is located in front of the brain and is shaped roughly like
a rectangular prism tapered towards the snout. The other two pockets are
located on the lateral sides of the electromotor cortex of the brain. At the
snout of the torpedo (roughly from the nostrils forward and above the
cartilege) there is an area of loose connective tissue that is organized into
columns, much like the way the electric organ tissue is structured
Peripheral nerves. The nerve fibers that innervate the electric organ
(figure 5) are heavily insulated by longitudinal sheaths of fibrous connective
tissue. A cross section of this fiber from a 30 em ray measured 4mm
diameter. In addition to heavily insulating fibrous connective tissue on the
nerves, some fibers are encased by continuous portions of the cartilege
skeleton. Specifically, two nerve trunks that innervate the posterior portion
of the body runs through the cartilege that houses the belly cavity (figure 5).
