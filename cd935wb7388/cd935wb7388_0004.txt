Another interesting field of study is electroreception. All
elasmobranchs and many teleosts have the ability to sense electric fields.
The electroreceptive organs in the torpedo are the ampullae of Lorenzini.
The ampullae are able to sense thermal, mechanical, and salinity changes as
well as electric fields (Kalmijn), and have many different uses in different
fish such as prey detection (Kalmijn), communication (Moller)
propioreception (Lissman), geomagnetic navigation (Rayan) and sexual
signals (Hopkins)
Littie is known about the uses of electroreception in the torpedo, but
studies of other elasmobranchs have shown electroreception is useful in prey
detection and geomagnetic navigation (Kalmijn). Also, while the location of
the ampullae have been described in the skate Kaya (Murray), they have not
been described in the torpedo. I have mapped the location and distribution
of the ampullae in the torpedo, laying the groundwork for more experiments
on ampullae in the torpedo. This has proven necessary because the location
and distribution of the ampullae in the torpedo is quite different from that
of the skate.
If the torpedo is able to sense electric fields, this electric sense could
be used with Pavlovian conditioning techniques to condition a ray to exhibit
a specific behavior on an electrical cue. We decided to test this hypothesis to
see if the torpedo can integrate information from the electroreceptors to the
point of learning. The conditioned response we sought was a discharge in
response to an electric stimulus. The unconditioned response was a poke on
the wing with a wood stick (the wing stomp). We hoped that by coupling the
wing stomp with an electric stimulus, the ray would eventually learn to
discharge when the unconditioned stimulus (the electric stimulus) was
presented without the wing stomp
