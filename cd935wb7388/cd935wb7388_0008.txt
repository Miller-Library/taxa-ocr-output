voltage drop. On dorsal skin, fourteen valid recordings were made from
thr√©e separate pieces of skin. On ventral skin, two pieces of skin were used
to make seven different recordings. The measurements from each piece of
tissue were averaged. Thus, the sample size for dorsal skin was 3 and for
ventral skin was 2. Since resistance depends upon the thickness of the
tissue, dorsal and ventral skin were measured using calipers to calculate the
resistivity of the tissue. Results were statistically analyzed with the
Student's T-test.
Conditioning:
A Grass DC stimulator was used to create the electric stimulus, and a Nicolet
digital oscilloscope measured the preamplified discharges. One measuring
lead was glued (with crazy glue and electrical tape) to the dorsal skin over
one elecroplaque, the other was in the water. During the training period,
every two minutes we applied an electric stimulus of 10 volts at a frequency
of 1000 Hz for one second duration. Immediately following the electric
stimulus we poked the ray on the wing with a wood stick. The
unconditioned and conditioned stimuli (the electrical pulse and the wing
stomp, respectively) were seperate in time so that the torpedo would come
to expect the wing stomp after experiencing the electric stimulus and learn
to discharge in expectation of the wing stomp.
For one hour on four consecutive days and again for two consecutive
days we trained the torpedo. Each day we tested the uncoupled electric
stimulus at least twice. When testing the response to the electric stimulus
without the wing stomp, we controlled for the movements in the water that
the stomp creates by coupling the electric stimulus to a stomp right next to
the wing.
