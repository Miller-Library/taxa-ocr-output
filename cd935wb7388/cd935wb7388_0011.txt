protected by layers of epithelial and fibrous connective tissues similar to
those over the electric organs. However, in contrast to the electric organs,
the body is further protected by an additional layer of loose connective
tissue and another dense layer of fibrous connective tissue (figure 9). All of
the muscles on the central axis are protected by a thick wrapping in fibrous
connective tissue. The fibrous connective tissue on the fins thins out toward
the edge of the ray and there is an additional layer of loose connective tissue
in the vertical plane between the cartilege and the fin muscle.
Skin Resistance:
The mean resistance for dorsal electric organ skin was 230 Kohms with
standard deviation equal to 62 Kohms. For ventral electric organ skin the
mean resistance was 94 Kohms with standard deviation equal to 19 Kohms
The Student's T-test shows this data to be statistically significant (P 60.05).
Measurements of the skin thickness in a 30 cm ray were: dorsal skin =0.9
mm and ventral skin = 0.7 mm. The cross sectional area = 28.26mm. This
gives the resistivity of dorsal skin - 7.2 Mohmsemm and for ventral - 3.8
Mohmsemm. The resistance of cartilege was infinite by my measurements.
Electroreception:
Location of Ampullae of Lorenzini. The tiny openings on the exterior
of the torpedo lead into the lateral line system or into ampullae of Lorenzini
(figure 10). The distinguishing factor is that the ampullar pores are slightly
larger than the lateral line pores. The jelly tubes run along the electric organ
side of the cartilege that separates the electric organ from rest of the fin
(figure 6). The ampullar bulbs (figure 11) are bundled in two locations
(figure 6). The first is directly in front of the eye socket cupped in an
indentation in the cartilege, the second is on the electric organ side of the
cartilege around the electric organ. The jelly tubes that lead from the
