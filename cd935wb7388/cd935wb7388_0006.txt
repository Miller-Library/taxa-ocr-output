Vin is the voltage provided by the stimulator measured on one channel of
the oscilloscope, Vout is the voltage after the 100 Kohm resistor measured on
the other channel of the oscilloscope. The resistance of the skin and the
electrodes act as two resistors in series, Relectrode and Rekin. To solve for
Eskin, 1 subtracted Reelectrode (no skin in the circuit) from R2(electrodet skin)
(with skin in the circuit).
In measuring skin resistance there were several logistical problems
that needed to be considered in making the electrodes. First, I needed to
créate a system that would not poke holes in the skin, because even the
smallest hole would allow enough ion leakage to lower the skin resistance to
nearly zero ohms. Second, it was very important that the charge travel
through the skin and not around the skin through sea water. Thus I needed
a way block the path of current around the section of tissue being measured
Third, resistance depends not only upon the properties of the material being
measured (resistivity), but also upon the cross sectional area in contact with
the current source, and the distance through the material that current has te
travel.
resistance - resistivity » (length/ cross sectional area)
Therefore, I needed to be able to align my electrodes perfectly each time to
keep the cross sectional area constant and I needed to stretch the tissue to
the same thickness for every measurement to keep the distance through the
material constant.
To remedy these problems I used a chamber (figure 3) made from one
petri dish and two petri dish lids with 6.0 mm holes drilled through them.
The electrodes were Ag/AgCl wires submerged in sea water as the
