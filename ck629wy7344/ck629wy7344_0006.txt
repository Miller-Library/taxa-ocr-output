Oystercatcher impact on limpets
the behavior of the bird was considered. If the bird directed the
usual conspicuous visually oriented strike at the limpet, then it
was recorded as 'in open' if the attack was within a stretch of
bare rock, and 'partially hidden' if directed alongside a clump of
algae. If the bird abtained the limpet by probing blindly in algae,
it was recorded as 'hidden'. All questionable cases were discarded.
I never observed the birds turning algae aside to uncover hidden
limpets. Clearly, limpets under algae were relatively safe from
oystercatchers in this study.
Slope preference of foraging oystercatchers:
Fig 5 presents data indicating that the birds seldom took lim-
pets which could not be reached from a slope of less than 15 degrees.
(Slopes were estimated through the telescope, and any which looked
very close to 15 degrees were considered greater than 15 degr√©es.)
General data collected throughout the birds' territory at various
times is again presented alongside the foraging site 1 data for
comparison. It is of interest that foraging site 1 provided ample
opportunity for the oystercatchers to try to get limpets on steer
slopes out of reach of gentle slopes. Limpets high on very steep
slopes (but not so high as to be in reach of a bird leaning over
the top) are effectively exempt from oystercatcher predation.
These birds were never seen trying to capture limpets while stand-
ing on slopes exceeding about 60 degrees.
Comparison of diet with availability:

commonly eaten size classes on foraging site 1 with actual consump-
