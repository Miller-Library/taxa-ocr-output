Oystercatcher impact on limpets
areas out of oystercatcher reach, occupied by C. digitalis, are
deficient in C. scabra. A possible explanation for this is the
finding by Haven (1973) that the two limpet species compete for the
same food supply, and that in mixed populations C. digitalis is the
superior competitor. In areas with high populations of C. digitalis,
C. scabra are less numerous and smaller. Collisella digitalis
dominates on steep slopes out of reach of oystercatchers, C. scabra
dominates horizontal rock faces, but it also dominates on vertical
faces in reach of oystercatchers.
One difference between my observations and those of Hartwick
(1976) is that Hartwick saw oystercatchers in British Columbia moving
algae aside in their search for prey. I did not, and the discrepan-
cy warrents further study. Different birds, or even different
groups of birds, may practice different methods of hunting. Indi-
vidual European Oystercatchers practice either the stabbing or ham-
mering technique of opening mussels, but not both (Norton-Griffiths,
1967). It is also possible that at lower densities of limpets ex-
posed to view or covered with algae, the birds may emphasize dif-
ferent hunting methods.
In conclusion, it is clear that the striking preferences exÂ¬
hibited by oystercatchers for certain species of limpets combined
with the limitations posed by their foraging methods may have im-
portant effects on the distribution and relative abundance of lim-
pet species in their foraging areas.
