Oystercatcher impact on limpets
Introduction:
The Black Oystercatcher, Haematopus bachmani Audubon, is a
shore bird which frequents the rocky parts of the west coast of
North America. It ranges from Alaska to Baja California, where it
is replaced by the black and white American Oystercatcher (A. 0. U.
Checklist, 1957). It is a year round resident throughout its range,
though uncommon (Stout, 1967).
Work by Webster (1941), Hartwick (1976), and Helbing (1976) in-
dicates that, while mussels are a major food, large numbers of lim¬
pets are also consumed by oystercatchers. It follows that they are
potentially capable of exerting considerable pressure on limpet pop¬
ulations in their foraging areas. The purpose of this study was to
investigate oystercatcher feeding activities and feeding behavior,
paying special attention to how they might affect the size-class
structure and spacial distribution of limpet populations. In par-
ticular, I looked for links between activities of oystercatchers and
the following well-documented observations on west coast'Acmaeid
distributions. Collisella digitalis (Rathke, 1833) is dominant on
steeply sloping substrates (Haven, 1971). Collisella pelta (Rathke,
1833) is commonly found under macroscopic algae (Jobe, 1968; Craig,
1968). Collisella scabra (Gould, 1846) is most common on horizon-
tal substrates exposed to sun (Haven, 1971), and also exhibits pre¬
cise homing behavior which results in a very close fit between shell
margin and home site substrate contour (e.g., Hewatt, 1910; Suther-
land, 1970).
