Oystercatcher impact on limpets
noted the visual nature of oystercatcher foraging (Helbing, 1976).
Although Hartwick (1976) mentions that they turn aside algae to find
what is underneath, I never observed such behavior. Nothing spe-
cific has been noted with respect to slope in other studies.
The observations concerning visibility and slope of prey are
most meaningful when related to diet composition and availability
(figs 2 and 3). As to prey visibility, the birds indeed may be re-
sponsible for the fact that most of the larger C. pelta one finds
are hidden under algae (like Pelvetia). The birds prefer C. pelta;
they take mostly limpets out in the open; and the C. pelta we find
are hidden.
It is striking that C. scabra is almost absent from the diet of
the oystercatcher, in spite of its abundance in acceptable size clas-
ses in the open (fig 6). Other researchers have found a similar
scarcity of C. scabra in the diet. Legg (1954) reported four C.
scabra fed to young oystercatchers at Point Lobos, California, in
a total sample of 111 limpets, and Helbing (1976) noted only three
C. scabra in a sample of 2360 limpets taken by oystercatchers in
Humboldt County, California. No information was provided on avail-
ability.
Helbing (1976) cites C. digitalis as the main item in the win-
ter diet of his birds. In my sample, C. digitalis was the second
most frequently consumed limpet (fig 2). The data in fig 7 suggests
that C. scabra may be abundant on horizontal surfaces partly be-
cause it is relatively immune to oystercatcher predation; C. digiÂ¬
talis on the other hand are selectively removed from areas acces-
sible to oystercatchers, consequently most animals appear on ver-
tical surfaces out of oystercatcher reach.
