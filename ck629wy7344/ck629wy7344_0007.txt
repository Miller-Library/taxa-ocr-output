Oystercatcher impact on limpets
tion by the birds. They had a striking tendency to overlook C.
scabra, in spite of its overwhelming abundance in the 10 to 20
millimeter range, and to select instead the relatively rare C.
pelta and C. digitalis. Figs 6B and C are directly comparable to
6A. 6D is only intended to show that the general trends in limpet
choice by the birds are reflected in the particular data from site
The fact that Collisella digitalis are consumed in fair numbers
and C. scabra all but avoided emphasizes the question of whether
oystercatcher foraging activities might be in part responsible for
the localization of C. digitalis on vertical slopes, and the dom-
inance of C. scabra on exposed horizontal areas. Fig 7 depicts
measurements made on two transects on foraging site 1 which indi-
cate that the birds may indeed be a factor in this phenomenon. C.
digitalis is the dominant species on the vertical slope out of reach
of the oystercatchers, whereas C. scabra dominates in regions ac-
cessible to the birds, even on vertical slopes. An interesting
fact is that during observation of foraging site 1 the oyster-
catchers were observed to remove and eat several limpets (almost
certainly C. digitalis) from the lower region of the vertical face
shown in fig 7.
Discussion and Conclusions:
Data presented in figs 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate that lim-
pets out of reach on steep slopes and limpets hidden well under mac-
roalgae are quite safe from the oystercatchers in this study, since
the birds rarely attack such limpets. Other observers have also
