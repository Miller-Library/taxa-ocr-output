Oystercatcher impact on limpets
Why do the birds avoid C. scabra? While many C. scabra are
too small for oystercatchers, fig 6 demonstrates that many others
are not. Perhaps C. scabra are in general too low in profile to
induce attack. The order of decreasing limpet prey preference in
fig 3 is also approximately the order of decreasing species shell
height. Collisella pelta, Fissurella volcano, and C. digitalis
all have fairly high shell apices as compared to C. limatula and
C. scabra, which are scarce in the diet. Another possibility is
that the homing behavior of C. scabra may decrease its vulner-
ability to oystercatcher predation. Animals on their indented
'home scars' have even lower profiles than the same animals away
from home. Further, limpets at home fit tightly to the substrate
and may be more difficult to dislodge. Wells (1980) found that
C. scabra placed in aquaria with predatory octopi were less frequent.
ly captured when they had access to their home site than when on a
strange rock lacking their home site, suggesting that homing be-
havior may reduce predation. With regard to oystercatcher preda-
tion, the birds feed mainly at low tide (Helbing, 1976), precisely
when C. scabra are at their home sites. The only C. scabra which
I actually observed being captured (I ran down and retrieved the
shell as soon as the bird had eaten it, since I suspected that it
was a C. scabra), was taken near high tide when the capture site
was partially awash and the limpets were probably moving about
foraging instead of attached to their home sites (Brandt, 1950).
Whatever the reason for neglect of C. scabra and attention to
C. digitalis by oystercatchers, the birds represent a potential
cause for the differential distribution of the two species on hore-
zontal and vertical rock surfaces. Fig 7 shows another phenomenon;
