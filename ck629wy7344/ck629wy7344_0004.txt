Oystercatcher impact on limpets
except for C. scabra whose population was so large that its numbers
were estimated by the use of twenty-three haphazardly placed 25cm x
25cm quadrats. Two transects surveyed on the second rock verified
that limpet distribution there was very similar to that found on
the first rock.
Results:
Detailed descriptions of limpet foraging by oystercatchers,
including methods of removal from rock and extraction of edible
parts from the shell, are given by Webster (1941) and Helbing
(1976). My observations confirm theirs, without substantial mod-
ifications, and are not repeated here.
Limpet availability on foraging site 1:
Results of the limpet survey on foraging site 1 appear in fig
2. Collisella pelta found living on the foraging site (after feed-
ing be the oystercatchers was observed) were mostly hidden under
leafy algae. C. scabra and C. digitalis were mostly located in the
open. Of these three species, C. scabra was by far the most abun-
dant, and C. pelta was actually scarce.
Limpets eaten:
Foraging oystercatchers tend to deshell their limpet prey on
rocks above water level. Consequently, shells of freshly eaten lim-
pets can often be collected following observation of foraging.
Newly cleaned shells can easily be recognized by the fact that they
often have small bits of fresh flesh still attached, and almost
always they are lying upside down on top of rocks or algae. Only
