Oystercatcher impact on limpets
Abstract:
The diet of Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani Audubon)
studied at Pacific Grove, California, included many limpets. In
this study, the birds usually took limpets clearly exposed to view,
not those hidden beneath larger leafy algae. Limpets on very steep
slopes were only attacked if the bird could do so while standing on
an adjacent gentle slope. Most of the limpets eaten were Collisella
pelta and C. digitalis; virtually none were C. scabra. This was in
striking contrast to the overwhelming abundance of C. scabra living
on foraging sites. Evidence is presented indicating that selective
predation by oystercatchers is important in the localization of
C. pelta under large leafy algae (animals in plain view at low tide
are selectively preyed upon), and in the separation of the habitat
niches of C. scabra and C. digitalis. C. digitalis survives best on
steep surfaces inaccessible to foraging oystercatchers; C. scabra,
largely not subject to oystercatcher predation, is more abundant on
horizontal surfaces where competition from other grazing limpets may
be less.
