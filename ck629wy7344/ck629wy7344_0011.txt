Acknowledgements
My sincere thanks go to my advisor Donald P. Abbott for his
endless ideas, time, suggestions, interest, and candid criticism,
without which this project would never have left the ground. I
also thank Charles Baxter for his assistance in identifying numer-
ous smelly limpet shells, as well as for his interest and en-
couragement.
