Oystercatcher impact on limpets
fresh shells were collected.
Shells from fresh prey provided the data in figure 3. Shells
collected from foraging site 1 on May 10, as well as all shells ever
collected at site 1, and shells collected at all sites, are plotted
separately for comparison. Throughout, C. pelta and C. digitalis
were selected frequently, while C. scabra were not. Also, limpets
between 10 and 25 millimeters in shell length were taken much more
often than those of other sizes.
Many more limpets were eaten during the total study period
than is suggested by the bulk data in fig 3. In most foraging sit-
uations it is impossible to collect many shells, since surge fre¬
quently washes freshly cleaned shells off the rocks before they can
be collected. In some cases the birds were foraging in places like
small rock islands that were inaccessible to me. In reality the
pair commonly consumed sixty or more limpets in a 15-30 minute for¬
aging period, but I was seldom able to collect more than a dozen
shells. Foraging site 1on May 10 was a valuable exception.
Visibility of limpets attacked:
The oystercatchers studied tended to take almost exclusively
limpets they could easily see, although they also neglect many
plainly visible limpets, notably C. scabra. Clearly, visibility
is not adequate to induce an attack. Figure I shows data collect-
ed at foraging site 1 on May 10, as well as general data from all
sites for comparison, with particular attention to the degree of con¬
cealment of the prey under attack. In many instances the limpet
attacked was plainly visible through the telescope on a patch of
bare rock. For attacks in which the prey was not plainly visible,
