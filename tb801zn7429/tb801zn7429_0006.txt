complicated? Could a second messonger within the cnidophage coll be
responsible for triggering discharge? Do the same ions that ellicit discharge of
nematocysts isolated from the anemone cause discharge in those from the
nudibranch, or have they been modified? My experiments intended approach
each of these questions.
Materials and Methods
Collection and care of animals
Anthopleura elegantissima were obtained from tide pools at Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA; Aeolidea papillosa and Metridium senile
were collected at a depth of about 40 feet from pilings of the Monterey Vharf.
Animals were maintained in tanks through which fresh sea water flowed at
15-18 C. A. papillosa fed on A. elegantissima placed in the tanks for that
purpose
Isolation of nematocysts by homogenization
Scissors were used to excise cerata from A. papillosa in sea water. The
cerata were then blotted gently on paper towels to remove excess mucus and
rinsed several times in the medium in which they would be homogenized.
Homogenization media used were filtered sea water, intracellular medium, and
1% saponin in distilled water. Intracellular medium contained (in mM):
