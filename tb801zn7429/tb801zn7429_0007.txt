K-Gluconate, 225: Mannitol, 185: Glycine, 300; Nacl, 20: MgCl,.5. HEPES, 20; EGTA,
2: NahC03. 2; all this adjusted to pH 7.2. Excised cerata where then placed in a
Dounce homogenizer and the chosen homogenization medium added at a liquid
to tissue ratio of about 10:1. After gentle homogenization and a five minute
incubation, homogenate was divided into separate aliquots and centrifuged two
minutes at 840 g to condense the isolated cnidae. One of the aliquots containing
only homogenization medium plus tissue debris was set aside as a control.
Additional aliquots were subjected to two experimental conditions: (1) An ion
was added to the supernatent or (2) supernatant was removed and test medium
added. In the first case, all soluble cellular components remained in the aliquot
in the second, cnidae were subjected to pure ionic conditions. Because the
chelating action of EGTA produces four protons per Ca2 Ca Cl, added to
homogenate in intracellular medium required pH adjustment. To achieve a net
addition of 2mMCa to the homogenate, I added 4mM CaCl,, expecting the EGTA
to absorb 2mM, then adjusted the pH with .IM KOH prior to incubation. After a
five minute incubation period, aliquots were stained with methylene blue and
inspected under the microscope (200X). Numbers of discharged and
undischarged cnidae were recorded on a manual counter and appear in Table 1
Behavior of nematocysts in vivo
Intact cerata excised and blotted as described above were rinsed in each
of the following media: 05M KCI, Cacl,. Nacl, and MgCl, 0.SM KCI, Cacl, Nacl,
and MgCl, sea water intracellular medium: 1% saponin; and one of several
concentrations of sodium citrate. The ceras was then placed on a slide in the
rinse medium plus one drop of 1% methylene blue and a cover slip placed over
it. Liquid could be gradually blotted from the edge of the cover slip until the
pressure produced caused the ceras to expel nematocysts. The percentage of
nematocysts that discharged could then be counted.
