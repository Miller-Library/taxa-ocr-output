anemone parts. Of course they acquire nematocysts, but might they also take up
cnidocyte receptors and other proteins critical for nematocyst discharge as
well? The extent of their scavenging remains to be shown.
Summary
While I have not succeeded in establishing how nematocysts work,I
have ruled out some possibilities. From the homogenization, digestion, and
dissection results, one can surmise that an interaction with the surrounding
tissues is necessary for efficient discharge. However, nematocysts within theis
cnidophages do not respond to any of the second messengers examined. The
development of procedures for isolating intact cnidophages allowed me to
examine their morphology more closely, raising interesting questions as to
their evolutionary origin.
