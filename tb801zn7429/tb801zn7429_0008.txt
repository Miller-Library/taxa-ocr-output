Isolation of intact enidophages
Placing the ceras on a slide and cutting it lengthwise with a razor blade
I could expose the white cnidosac and tease it free of the surrounding tissues.
The cnidosac could then be minced in sea water using razor blade and forceps to
free intact cnidophage cells visible at 200X under the phase microscope. A
water immersion lens was used so the preparation could be viewed without a
cover slip. By this technique, both nematocysts and cnidophages could be
obtained in solution, 100% undischarged. Solutions containing various second
messenger inducers could then be pipetted directly onto the slide and their
effect on both cnidophages and nematocysts observed. (For chemicals and
concentrations used, see table 3). Having watched the cnidophages as I added
an inducer, I then incubated the slide 10-20 minutes at 15 C and again counted
the number of intact cnidophages. As a control, intact cerata were forced to
extrude nematocysts into media containing the same concentration of each
inducer to be sure that the cnidae still discharged normally.

Nematocysts Isolated by Homogenization
Data from homogenization experiments appears in Table 1. Under no
condition could nematocysts isolated by this method be induced to show a
significant frequency of discharge. Spirocysts isolated in intracellular medium,
on the other hand, discharged readily upon exposure to seawater.
