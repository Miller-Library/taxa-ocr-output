In Aeolidea papillosa I observed five to twelve nematocysts bundled
parallel to one another in each cnidophage (Figure 2). The cnidophages seem to
be maintained at no particular orientation within the cnidosac (although
Greenwood and Mariscal observed otherwise for a different species, 1984).
When a ceras placed under a cover slip experiences pressure, a pore opens at its
tip and muscular pulsing forces the cnidophages through it one at a time. In
hundreds of observations, tubules were never seen to evert within the cnidosac
or cnidopore but a large percentage did so immediately upon emerging from the
pore. Whether the cnidophage membrane ruptures before or after its resident
nematocysts discharge is difficult to determine. As more cnidophages emerge
from the pore, they accumulate in a tangled mass. (Figure 3)
Table 2 shows the percent discharge for nematocysts emerging in vivo
into different ionic media. For cerata from the same animal, this assay should
test the effect of certain ions on nematocysts that have experienced similar
conditions during extrusion. In calcium-free media, including Na-citrate,
intracellular medium with EGTA, and MgCl, the cerata ceased contracting, but
extrusion could be forced using pressure on the cover slip.
Agents eliciting second messenger response
Data from the second messenger experiments appear in Table 3. Isolated
cnidophages could be observed under the microscope while the
second-messenger-inducing solution was added; this observation yields the
number in the second column. Discharge after a 10 to 20 minute incubation
appears in the third column. Positive percentages indicate that after
in cubation, some cnidophages were observed with everted tubules protruding
through their membranes.
