Introduction
Cnidarians, including sea anemones and hydra, are endowed with
specialized stinging organelles called cnidae. Three types of cnidaeÂ¬
spyrocysts, nematocysts, and ptychocysts- reside in specialized cells, the
cnidocytes, lining the tentacles. Nematocysts contain a coiled tubule that everts
under excitatory conditions to produce a thin thread or barbed tubule through
which poison may be dispatched. Eversion of the tubule has been classified as
rapid excocytosis and occurs in less than three milliseconds. (Holstein and
Tardent, 1984) Spyrocysts, on the other hand, discharge a fine web that clings to
prey items, holding them close to the tentacles where they can be pierced by
nematocysts. Neither the direct cause of nematocyst excitation nor the
mechansim of eversion is well understood.
Three models have been proposed to explain nematocyst discharge: (1)
In response to some stimulus, a sudden osmotic change in the contents of the
capsule causes an influx of vater and the sudden pressure forces ejection of the
tubule. Measurements of the capsular contents show that thread eversion is
accompanied by a dramatic decrease in calcium concentration within the
capsule. (Lubbock and Amos, 1981) Considering the relatively high amounts of
calcium (600 mM) present in the undischarged capsule, researchers speculate
that this calcium binds soluble proteins into aggregates. Upon some stimulus
calcium is removed from these complexes, releasing the proteins into solution
thereby increasing the osmolarity of the intracapsular fluid (Lubbock and
Amos, 1981). The subsequent influx of water causes discharge. (2) A second
hypothesis postulates that the three apical flaps at the active end of the capsule
