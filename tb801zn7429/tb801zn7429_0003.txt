Abstract
Nemacysts isolated from Aeolidea papillosa were subjected to different ionic
media and their frequency of discharge assessed. Discharge of nematocysts isolated by
homogenization could not be induced, suggesting that proper function of the cnidae is
at least partially dependent on surrounding tissues. When nematocysts are extruded
from intact cerata into ionic media, conditions that inhibit normal contraction of the
cerata also reduce nematocyst discharge. Some aspect of passage through the
cnidopore or contact with sea water could initiate an intracellular signal in the
cnidophage that causes its nematocysts to discharge. A battery of second-messenger
inducing systems including forskolin (stimulates adenylate cyclase), TPA (stimulates
protein kinase C, calcium ionophore (causes release of intracellular Ca stores), and
pH affectors failed, however, to cause nematocyst discharge from isolated cnidophage
cells.
