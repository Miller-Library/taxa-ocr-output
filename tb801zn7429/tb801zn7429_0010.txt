Discussion
Although previous researchers have assumed that contact with sea water
triggers eversion of the tubule for nematocysts extruded from Aeolidcerata
(Greenwood and Mariscal, 1984), the balance of my observations suggest
otherwise. Something in the pulsing action of the cerata and perhaps passage
through the cnidopore seems critical for efficient discharge. Hidaka and
Mariscal (1988) note that nematocysts isolated in different media from the sea
anemone Calliactis tricolor show differential tendencies to discharge in
response to the same stimulus. The procedures I used suggest that nematocysts
stored by the nudibranch also fail to discharge normally in isolation:
Nematocysts isolated by homogenization could not be induced to discharge even
under the most extreme conditions (.17 saponin, triton, or SDS in ddH,0).
Digestion of cerata with collagenase in sea water yielded a suspension of free
nematocysts in which less than one percent had discharged. Furthermore,
cnidophages and free nematocysts could be released into sea water by dissection
of the cnidosac without eliciting discharge. Cerata from the same animal, placed
under a cover slip, extruded clumps of nematocysts that showed 90% discharge,
These results indicate that contractile action of the cerata or passage through
the cnidopore must play some essential role in activating the nematocysts.
None of the ions tested seems essential for triggering discharge from
intact cerata (Table 2). Differences in 7 discharge are deceptive because the 0.8
and U.5M cases were measured using cerata from different animals. Presumably,
such variables as the health of the animal and the age of its nematocysts
influence the viability of its defensive system.
The observation that divalent cations appear to stabalize undischarged
nematocysts from sea anemones (Blanquet, 1970) seems to hold for Aolidea only
