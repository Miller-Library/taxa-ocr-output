An electrophysiological setup was used to record the activity in the hind brain and spinal
cord. Two glass electrodes were pulled using 1.5mm glass with a filament and filled with O.5 M
Nacl. The two AC coupled differential recording electrodes were inserted into the hindbrain and
spinal cord. Neural signals and movement artifacts were visualized on using an oscilloscope and
recorded at 4 kHz using Axoscope (Axon). Only movement artifacts were analyzed.
The following procedure was carried out for LI, L2 dark reared, and L2 ambient light
reared larvae. Each larva was allowed to "dark adapt" for five minutes in a cage covered with tin
foil on all sides except the front which had a dark tarp over the front of it. I recorded activity
starting at minute four. At minute five, I administered a sequence of eight light flashes (-O.5 sec
duration) with decreasing latency between them (fig. 2) The first flash being at 5 min, followed
by one at 5:30, 5:45, 5:55, 6.00, 6.05, 6:10, and 6:15. The larva was then allowed to "dark
adapt" again for 2 min at which point the microscope light was turned on. The larva remained on
the setup for five minutes with the light off and the procedure was repeated,
In order to look at the influence of the emerging visual system on the response pathway,
two comparisons were made. Spontaneous activity (movement) in the light (recording when the
light was on after the sequence of light flashes) and dark (recording at minute 4 after the larvae
were allowed to dark adapt) were analyzed by plotting the power density spectra for both light
and dark for all three developmental conditions. Power density spectra was used in order to look
at differences in movement frequencies. The second comparison was a qualitative difference in
response between L2 dark reared and L2 ambient light reared larvae to a sequence of photic
stimuli. Due to a small sample size (n- 2), statistical analysis was not performed.
