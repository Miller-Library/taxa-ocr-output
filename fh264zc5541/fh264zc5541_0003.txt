These experiments looked at the possible influence the emerging visual system may gain in
the developing larvae. Because a main source of sensory input to the M-cell is from the eve
changes in behavior associated with the pigmentation of the retinal epithelium may be a sign that
the visual system is now influencing escape behavior mediated by the M-cell to a greater extent
(fig. 1). Animals in larval stage 1 (LI) and larval stage 2 (L2), morphologically and behaviorally,
are very different. LI begins right after hatching. The head is small and in relative proportion to
the rest of the body. Blaxter (1986) found that the eyes of many teleost species do not have
pigmentation and "are almost certainly non-functional" at hatching. Retinal epithelium
pigmentation is absent in LI larvae suggesting that their visual system is not fully functional.
Blaxter (1986) also found that by first feeding all species had pigmented eyes. After hatching, LI
larvae, who are generally not very active rely on the yolk sac for nutrients and do not need to
feed. However as the yolk sac is depleted, the larvae need to be able to catch prey. This requires
having a jaw that is large enough to capture prey, mastering feeding behavior, and having a
functional visual system that allows the larvae to locate prey. In contrast to LI, L2 occurs about
the time when the yolk sac is beginning to be depleted, larvae have an enlarged jaw, which opens
and closes in a manner characteristic of adult feeding behavior, and retinal epithelium
pigmentation.
LI and L2 larvae also exhibit differences in responsiveness to tactile and visual stimuli. LI
larvae, though not generally very active, are extremely responsive to vibration or touch. When
the tank is tapped or the larvae are mechanically stimulated, LI larvae typically exhibit a fast start
escape response. In contrast, L2 larvae are much more active, move in a more sustained
