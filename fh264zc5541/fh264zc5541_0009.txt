recording in the optic tectum could possibly narrow down where less developed areas in the visual
system between LI and L2 larvae are. If activity is found in the increased activity is found in the
optic tectum between the 2 stages, then it would suggest that the difference in development is
before that point (eg having to due with lack or presence of eye pigmentation). However, if
activity levels are the same, this would suggest that the difference is after the optic tectum and the
link between the optic tectum and the M-cell could be what is less developed between the 2
stages.
In order to better look at action potentials and neural activity, it would be helpful to use
curare in future experiments in order to suppress movement in the larvae
