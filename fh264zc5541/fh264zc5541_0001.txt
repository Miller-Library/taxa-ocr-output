Abstract
During development, organisms must establish properly functioning and well coordinated
sensory and motor systems in order to survive. Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis), pelagic fishes
belonging to the tuna family, undergo a relatively rapid developmental transformation in the X24Â¬
hour period after hatching. The two major morphological changes that occur are enlargement of
the jaw and pigmentation of the eye (retinal epithelium). In addition, dramatic behavioral changes
take place. For example, early (stage LI) animals frequently exhibit fast start escape responses
while in the later stage (L2), more controlled sustained swimming movements are present. Li
larvae are also more sensitive to touch and vibration stimuli than L2. To test the hypothesis that
the emerging visual system changes the activity of descending motor systems, I recorded field
potentials in the hindbrain and spinal cord during this developmental period. Recordings of
spontaneous activity showed that there was essentially no difference between LI and L2 larvae.
either in the light or dark. The same was true for L2 larvae reared in the dark. Looking at the
strong visual stimuli, larvae reared in dark exhibit a movement response but recover more slowly
than those reared under normal (daylight) conditions. This finding suggests that dark rearing
negatively affects the sensitivity of the developing visual system, however appropriate connections
with the hindbrain still appear to be made. Based on these observations, it appears that visual
inputs might be sufficient to modify the activity of an identified reflex circuit, and more specific
experiments are warranted to identify the physiological basis for this change.
