positive and negative deflections. The response to the short latency flashes (10 sec and 5 sec after
previous flash) also was similar between the rearing conditions. It was small with usually only one
or two positive deflections. The difference between the two rearing conditions came with flash 15
sec after the previous one (fig. 5). Ambient light reared L2 had a large response like that for the
initial and 30 sec flash. However, the dark reared L2 had a response characteristic of the shorter
latency flashes. In addition, a few trials were completed in which there was an initial flash
followed by one 5 sec later in which both ambient light and dark reared larva responded in a
similar manner to the short latency flashes of above (fig. 5).
Discussion
The results from the spontaneous activity in light versus dark experiment was interesting
in that it showed that L2D larvae, although appearing the same as L2L larvae morphologically,
were more similar to LI larvae behaviorally. It appears that activity levels are fairly consistent
among all three groups in both the light and dark for mid range frequencies, but diverges at the
higher and lower frequencies for L2L larvae. A possible explanation for the greater amplitude of
lower frequency events in the light for L2L larvae is that these larvae tend to be more active in the
light. Also being embedded on their side, which is not the natural orientation, may cause the
larvae to struggle to orient towards the light. The LI larvae and L2D larvae, not being as
responsive to light because of their less developed visual system, and the L2 larvae in the dark
without the light cue are not struggling as much to reorient.
The photic stimulation results suggest that dark rearing affects properties of the visual
system. The difference in response could be due to either slower refractory time or faster
