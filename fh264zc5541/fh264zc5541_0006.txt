Because eugenol wears off eventually, larvae were able to move although embedded in
agar. Movement events (amplitude of electrode deflection) were fairly large (about 40x) in
comparison to neural events and were therefore easier to separate out from the background noise.
In general they tended to be long events, with multiple peaks that had both positive and negative
deflections. Neural activity was not looked at in as much detail as movement because due to
sampling frequencies and smaller amplitudes it was harder to distinguish from noise
From the recordings, I was able to extract signals from the nosie. The Power Density
Spectra (PDS) shows the relative abundance or amplitude of a given frequency for a given trace
In contrast to a fast Fourier transformation, it uses a sliding box to calculate the relative
abundances. Because the PDS is relative for each trace, a difference in the shape of the curves
rather than in the magnitude of power shows the differences in the amplitude of a given
frequency. Figure 3 shows a difference between movement traces and baseline noise between 10
and 60Hz.
plotted the PDS for spontaneous activity in the light versus activity in the dark (fig. 4).
LI and L2 dark reared larvae are shown to have similar movement frequencies. L2 ambient light
reared larvae also has these movement frequencies as well as a greater abundance of higher
frequency movements in the dark and lower frequency movements in the light. In general
however, activity levels are consistent in the light versus the dark for all three rearing conditions.
In response to photic stimulation, there is a difference between ambient light and dark
reared larvae. The response to the initial flash and the one 30 seconds later in both rearing
conditions was similar. It tended to be long (40-60 ms) and was large in amplitude with multiple
