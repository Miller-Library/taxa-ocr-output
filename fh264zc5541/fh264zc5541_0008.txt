adaptation to the stimuli by dark reared larvae. Because a few trials were done where an initial
light flash was followed by a second one 5 sec later, the difference is most likely due to a longer
refractory time. This assumes that refractoriness recovers aster a time greater than 5 sec and less
than 30 sec and adaptation does not. Without out the photic stimulation to the visual system, it
may have not developed to the same complexity or sensitivity as in the light reared larvae.
There are other complications with dark rearing. Growth and development does not occur
in the dark in the wild and therefore due to the abnormal growth environment some of the
differences are most certainly due to impacts of the dark on systems other than the visual system.
Other methods of testing the absence or underdevelopment of the visual system would be to
dissect out the eye, cut the optic nerve, or inactivating the optic tectum by injecting with
lidocaine. Each of these techniques would look at different parts of the visual pathway. By
looking at them all, we may be able to see which part of the emerging visual system is developing
at a given time in growth.
In f√ºrther studies, there should be better control of temperature and light. It is possible
that the dark reared larvae were slightly cooler than the ambient light reared larvae which could
have an effect on the rate of development. Ambient light in Monterey is extremely variable with
some days being very sunny and others (the majority) being mostly foggy. Therefore it would be
helpful to put them on a 12:12 light:dark cycle. It would also be good to work in darkness while
setting the larvae and inserting electrodes as opposed to letting them light adapt and then dark
adapt again.
Other possible experiments include recording in the optic tectum to find out what type of
activity it modulates. Because input from the eye travels through the optic tectum to the M-cell.
