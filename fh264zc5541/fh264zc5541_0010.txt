Acknowledgments
Special thanks to: Matthew McFarlane who spent endless hours in lab with me making sure
everything worked and for teaching me a love for bonito. My advisor Stuart Thompson who
always had so much energy and excitement for the project. And Christian Reilly who provided
help not only on the project, but also sanity breaks by talking to me about everything except
bonito.
