swimming manner, and have lost much of their sensitivity to stimuli especially vibration.
Not observing a predator, the visual system may send an inhibitory signal to the command
cell (M-cell) causing an L2 larva not to respond to simple vibrational stimuli. An underdeveloped
visual system, not having the same influence in the sensory-motor pathway would not be able to
inhibit this response and the larvae would be extremely responsive as is the case with LI larvae.
In order to study the developing visual system, an electrophysiological setup was used to
look at both spontaneous and light stimulated activity in the hindbrain and the spinal cord. LI, L2
dark reared (L2D), and L2 ambient light reared (L2L) larvae were compared. In respect to
behavior, L2D larvae were generally more similar to LI larvae than L2L larvae. Though
spontaneous activity in the light and dark were similar for all three groups, L2L larvae tended to
have a broader range of movement frequencies with a greater amplitude of higher frequency
movement in the dark and lower frequency movement in the light. In addition, a comparison
between light and dark reared L2 larvae's behavioral response to a sequence of photic stimuli
showed a difference in refractory time with L2D larvae needing a longer time to recover.
Methods
Larvae were obtained and hatched at Monterey Bay Aquarium (Monterey, California)
They were left undisturbed in seawater kept at room temperature until after hatching, at which
time they were moved to the lab. Some larvae were allowed to develop in ambient light and
others were placed in a dark room. Eugenol was used to anesthetize the larvae because it works
quickly and is reversible. The anesthetized larvae were then embedded in 1.2% agar (made with
tuna Hanks) on its side and then allowed to recover.
