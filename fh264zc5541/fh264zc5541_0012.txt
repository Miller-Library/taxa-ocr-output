Figure Legends
Fig. 1. Fast start escape response pathway. Influence of the emerging visual system on M-cell
mediated response is unknown.
Fig. 2. Photic stimuli sequence. Larvae allowed to dark adapt for 5 min before the administering
of 8 light flashes.
Fig. 3. Power Density Spectra (PDS) of movement and baseline noise. Lower frequencies are
movement whereas higher frequencies are noise. Movement traces were determined by
watching the larvae under the microscope and correlating when they moved and the
activity on the oscilloscope.
Fig. 4. PDS activity in the light vs. dark for LI, L2D, and L2L. LI and L2D are very similar.
LZL has a greater amplitude of higher frequency movement in the dark and lower
frequency movement in the light.
Fig. 5. Activity traces for photic stimuli after differing latencies between flashes. Shows an
increased refractory time for L2D.
