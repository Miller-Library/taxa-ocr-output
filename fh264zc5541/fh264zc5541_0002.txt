Introduction
During development, organisms need to establish properly functioning sensory and motor
systems in order to survive. These systems also must be well coordinated to changing
environmental conditions. Pacific Bonito (Sarda chiliensis), pelagic fishes belonging to the tuna
family, undergo a relatively rapid developmental transformation early in their larval life history,
Some of the morphological changes that occur during this period include jaw enlargement,
pigmentation of the retinal epithelium, and lateral migration of the neuromasts. These changes
take place about one day after hatching, are complete within 24 hours and are accompanied by a
change in behavior. The behavioral changes include less sensitivity to vibration and touch.
horizontal orientation as opposed to vertical, and slower more sustained movement.
Most fishes and amphibians possess a well conserved stimulus/response pathway that
underlies sensation of tactile stimuli. The receptor for the sensory limb of this pathway is the
neuromast, which is anatomically and physiologically similar to hair cells. Neuromasts transmit
somatosensory information to the CNS via the lateral line nerve to motor centers in the hindbrain.
For most fish, signals converge at the Mauthner cell (M-cell) which is a large neuron found in the
medulla oblongata. In goldfish, the M-cell has two main dendrites. The lateral dendrite receives
input from the ear and the ventral dendrite receives input from the eye through the optic tectum
(Zottoli et al., p. 153). This neuron coordinates muscular activity by propagating the signal down
a centralized pathway. This pathway is thought to be responsible for generating the large
accelerations that occur during the escape response. Stimulation of a single M-cell produces a
forceful flip of the truck and tail to the side opposite of the M-cell. In addition, sudden movement
of both eyeballs, both operculi, and the lower jaw is synchronous with the tail movement
