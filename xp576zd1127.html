Introduction: The ability of the isopod Cirolana harfordi
to withstand prolonged periods of anoxia (W. Johnson, unpub.)
at normal activity levels suggests the presence of an efficient
facultative anaerobic metabolism. The study of oxygen
consumption and debt, when compared to declining oxygen
tension, leads to a knowledge of lactate production which
can be used to predict the nature of aerobic- anaerobic
switching setpoints, and to estimate the efficiency of the
metabolic pathway beyond lactate. Such knowledge, if later
compared with various substrate concentrations produced by
oxygen stress, should delineate the entire pathway.
I. Determination of anoxic capabilities and dependent variables.
Eight 30 ml. vials were filled with sea water and bubbled
with oil-pumped nitrogen gas for fifteen minutes. Three
other 30 ml. vials were treated as controls, and were analysed
by the Winkler Method for oxygen concentrations (1,2,3).
Four animals were then placed in each vial, and seven vials
were sealed, the eighth being a second control. Water temperature
was constant at 18 degrees C.; and record was kept of
survival time for each animal. (Table 1). The Winkler controls
showed an oxygen concentration of .24 ml. 0/liter, an anaerobic
environment according to Von Brand (4); and a second series of
page two
Winkler tests were performed upon three of the closed vial
water samples at the end of the experiment, showing concen-
trations of .019 ml. 0/liter.
The earliest death of all the animals in vial f8, the
control, led to a second experiment in which all vials were
left open to the air, none of them having been treated with
nitrogen. pH readings were taken approximately every three
hours with indicator paper, and no variance from the initial
value of 6.5 was recorded. (Table 2). A visual analysis of
microorganisms found in three typical vials is given in
Table 3, based upon a week of incubation, and it was concluded
that the death of whole vials was due to bacterial action.
The result of the first experiment indicated the susceptibility
of brooding females to death by oxygen stress, thereby furnish-
ing bacteria with organic matter necessary for large population
growth. These results were verified in later experiments.
and tend to disqualify respiration studies done by other
researchers without proper antibiotic control.
II. Determination of oxygen curves.
Oxygen concentrations were measured with a Yellow Springs
Instrument Co. #53 meter and probe in connection with a
Beckman 1005 10" Chart Recorder. Both the probe and a
thermometer were fitted into the rubber stopper of a 1 liter
Erlenmeyer flask; isopods were contained in a small cage of
plastic screen, suspended by nylon fishline above the stirring
flea(required for good ventilation of the probe); and during
page three
experiments a diffusion seal was made at the stopper with the
application of high-vacuum lubricant. The animals were all initially
placed in 1 liter of sea water filtered through Whatman GF/C
glass fiber filters; and, when indicated, antibiotics were added
in the following concentrations: Penicillin- 500 units/ml.,
and Streptomycin- .5 mg./ml. Care was taken to allow no gas
space or bubbles within the flask during experiments to avoid
adverse effects upon the probe and addition of oxygen in more
than saturation concemtrations to the flask. Probe accuracy was
assured by calibration against saturated seawater samples at
room temperature, and was checked against a Y.S.I. 451 meter
fitted with a +54 (temperature corrected) probe. Temperature of
the flask was at all times within one degree of 23 degrees C.,
measured with a 1/10 degree accuracy.
The first experiment was conducted with 50 male <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cirolana : Exact'>Cirolana,</span>
whose total wet weight after was 5.0 grams; antibiotics were
used, resulting in a 98% survival rate; and no test was made
for oxygen debt. Initial tension was 19% Saturation, or 6.3 ppm.
or 4.5 ml. 0/liter. Final tension was 2% Saturation, time
elapsed to minimum 0,- tension was 12:30 hrs. The average O,-
consumption rate, derived as Net 0, change, was .315 ml. 0,/L/hr.,
Time élapsed
or .063 ml. 0/gm./hr. (Graph #1).
The second experiment was done with 50 male Cirolana, total
wet weight of 2.6 grams; antibiotics were not used, resulting
in a 30% survival rate; and oxygen debt was tested by allowing
the isopods to remain at minimum oxygen for 6 hours before sub-
page four
stituting oxygen- saturated water for the oxygen-depleted
water, a process which took approximately one minute. (Graph 42).
For the first oxygen tension curve, initial tension was 177,
or 5.6 ppm, or 4.0 ml. 02/liter. Final tension was 1% Saturation,
time elapsed to oxygen minimum was 10:30 hours. The average
O2- consumption rate was .36 ml./L/hr., or .138 ml. O/gm./hr.
Initial tension for the Op- debt was 18% Saturation, or
6ppm, or 4.3 ml. 02/liter. Final tension was 1% Saturation,
time elapsed to oxygen minimum was 6:18 hrs. The average O,
consumption rate was .63 ml. 02/L/hr., or, due to the mortalities
during debt measurement, from .24 ml. O/gm./hr. to .8 ml. Op/gm./hr.
The third respiration experiment was done with 50 male Cirolana,
total wet weight of 2.5 grams; antibiotics were used, resulting in
a 94% survival rate; and oxygen debt was tested as in the previous
experiment. For the first oxygen tension curve, initial tension
was 16% Saturation, or 5.3 ppm, or 3.8 ml. Op/liter. Final tension
was 2.5% Saturation, time elapsed to minimum oxygen tension was
16:10 hours. The average Op- cnnsumption rate was .196 ml. 02/L/hr.,
or .08 ml. 0/gm./hr.
Initial tension for the O2- debt was 17% Saturation, or 5.6 ppm,
or 4.0 ml. 0,/liter. Final tension was 2.5% Saturation, time elapsed
to oxygen minimum was 12:42 hours. The average Op- consumption rate
was .266 ml. 02/L/hr., or from.106 ml. O/gm./hr. to .113 ml.O/gm/hr.
(range predicated upon mortalities during debt measurement).
(Graph 43).
Because of the large discrepancy in initial rates and debts
between Graphs 2 and 3, oxygen was monitored in an unfiltered
sea water sample fram the <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Cirolana : PartialExact'>Cirolana aquarium,</span> with no isopods in
page five
the flask. At 23 degrees C. there was no measureable oxygen
consumption over 12 hours. Another similar experiment, also
without antibiotics, was conducted, and differed from the first
only in the addition of 30 Cirolana, 2.4 grams wet weight, all
freshly killed in a 95% methanol solution. It should be noted
that the total wet weight in both Graph +2 and #3 is 2.5-2.6 gms.,
and that the mortality rate in Graph 42 was 35 animals/50 animals.
The results of this experiment are analysed in a slightly
different manner, as there is a 6:05 hours period of initial
bacterial growth without measureable O- consumption. The initial
tension was 17% Saturation, or 5.6 ppm, or 4.0 ml. O/liter.
Final tension was 1% Saturation, time elapsed to minimum oxygen
from O-hour was 12:45 hrs.; time elapsed to minimum oxygen from
beginning of measureable consumption was 6:40 hours. The average
02- consumption rate was .57 ml. 0,/L/hr., or .24 ml. O/gm./hr.
(Graph #4).
The use of wet weight in these experiments was not an original
idea (Steve Webster, dissertation thesis), but was adapted because
of the preponderance of non-respiring (chitonous) organic material
found in isopods. Repeatable weighings were achieved for a single
animal over eight trials, and the value obtained (.lgm) perfectly
matched the average weight of 50 animals of the same size class,
also wet weight. Fifty- animal group weights (wet) were repeatable
to .1 gram.
III. Conclusions
1. Bacteria contribute largely to oxygen consumption measurements
unless antibiotics are used, but such contribution does not become
measureable until specimen death provides the needed organic
page six
nutrients for accelerated bacterial growth. Such deaths in
Cirolana are usually brooding females, who have a lower stress
tolerance; this is most likely due to the abstinence from feeding
in brooding females (W. Johnson, dissertation thesis) and the
subsequent lack of amino reserves required for anaerobic metabo-
lism (5,6,7). Concentratinns of 500units Penicillin/ml. and
.5gm. Streptomycin/ml. raise survival rates over 24 hours of
continual 0,- stress from 30% to 94-98%.
2. Cirolana harfordi develops an oxygen debt if allowed to
reduce O2- tension from saturation to 1-2% Saturation, and
this debt leads to a consumption rate of 1.38 x the original
rate when the animals are kept at their minimum 0,- tensian
for six hours.
3. Oxygen saturation levels of 1-2% are effectively anoxic for
Cirolana harfordi, as the animal seems physiologically incapable
of reducing O2- tension below this value.
4. Wet weights on Cirolana are repeatable without blotting,and
are more representative of the amount of respirational tissue
than are dry weights, which are primarily derived from chiton.
5. Cirolana harfordi seems to have an efficient anaerobic metabolic
pathway: survival of O- stress and anoxia is nearly 100% over
24 hours when bacteria are removed from test water; the oxygen
tension curves reveal no attempt by the animal to slow aerobic
respiration with decreasing oxygen tensions, although activity
continues at a normal rate even at 0- levels of zero.
6. The switchpoint for aerobic-anaerobic conversion must occur
before Cirolana reaches zero oxygen tension, due to the energy
page seven
requirements imposed by maintained normal activity.

APPENDIX
Proposal: A Study of Anaerobiosis in Cirolana harfordi
Mark R. Anderson
Proposal: A Study of Anaerobiosis in Cirolana harfordi
Introduction:
It has been recently proposed (22,32,21) that certain
anaerobic metabolic pathways are far more energetically pro¬
ductive than initially assumed, yielding as many as thirteen
moles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per mole of glucose
in comparison with the two moles of ATP liberated by incomplete
oxidation of glucose to lactate.(see figure on p. 2)
Indications of such a pathway have also been found in human
muscle and in several diving vertebrates (21). Each basic
point of this intriguing pathway has been investigated by
other researchers, using techniques which range from pulse-
labeling (36,3) to competetive - enzyme activity ratios (8,10)
to quantitative substrate assays (20, 15).
The basic points of the pathway, with support as indicated,
are the following:
1) The aerobic- anaerobic branchpoint is located at phospho-
enol pyruvate (PEP) (37, 14);
2) Negative feedback exists between the two PEP branchings
(37);
3)Glutamate and other amino acids serve as redox substrates
(37, 14, 18, 1);
4) Lactate may be converted preferentially into succinate
(23,33,17,29,5,9,16,19,38,26);

5) Succinate may be converted into propionate (25,20).
The ability of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ascaris lumbricoides : Exact'>Ascaris lumbricoides</span> to metabolize to
propionate (35), in conjunction with Hochachka's findings in
vertebrate muscle (21) and known anaerobiosis in such crustacea
as barnacles (30,31,27), ostracods (28) and isopods (2,7)--
not to mention coelenterates (34), echinoderms (6), and molluscs
(29,24,32)--suggests that something similar to the newly-proposed
pathway might be found in the isopod Cirolana harfordi. Having
done several experiments, I can offer the following results:
1) The population taken from holdfasts of the kelp <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis pyrifera : Exact'>Macrocystis
pyrifera</span> in the sheltered Great Tide Pool, Pacific Grove, had
a median survival time (LTgo) of 21 hours at 18 degrees C.;
2) The maximum survival time was 42 hours, and could probably
be lengthened in closed-vial tests through the use of antibiotics;
3)brooding females are less resistant to anoxia than males;
4)pH does not change by more than.5 during exposure to anoxic
conditions;
5)activity remains high even at O2 concentrations of.O19
ml. Oo/liter H.O (anaerobic conditions, according to von Brand,
1946) as determined by the Winkler method (11,12,13). It is also
known that <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. harfordi</span> develop an oxygen debt which is repaid
after anoxia (W. Johnsan, unpub.), although the extent of the debt
and the nature of the substrate are unknown.
Method:
After segregation by sex and weight, C. harfordi specifens
will be placed in a sealed flask, stoppered with a Y.S.I.754
page three
oxygen probe (equipped for temperature measurement). The flask
is to contain water at equilibrium with the air; and oxygen
consumption ys. time and oxygen consumption vs. oxygen tension
graphs will be obtained for each sex and size group. After twelve
hours at zero oxygen tension, all vials will again be saturated
with air, and oxygen debts determined.
Subsequently subjecting the a imals by the same sex-size
relationships to the conditions denoted above, the vials will be
opened at regular intervals, the animals withdrawn and fixed accor-
ding to (Wollenberger,et.al.,1960) in liquid nitrogen. Assays
for lactate (after Wieland, 1928) and succinate (after Bergmeyer,
1965) will be made, and graphs of lactate and succinate concentration
ys. oxygen tension will be generated.
Water in the vials will also be assayed, as bivalve molluscs,
brachiopods (18) and cirripeds (27) are known to excrete incompletely
oxidized substrates.
As a final verification of the relevance of anaerobic studies
on Cirolana, microhabitat oxygen tension studies will be conducted
1) under intertidal rocks north of Agassiz Beach at Hopkins Marine
Station, where there are large communities of Cirolana harfordi;
and 2) inside kelp holdfasts of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>Macrocystis.</span> An attempt will be
made to correlate Cirolana's anaerobic capability with such
behavioral aspects as clumping and response to surf action.
Objectives:
To determine:
page four
1) the relative amounts of lactate and succinate formed at dif-
ferent oxygen tensions, hopefully indicating the aerobic-
enaerobic switching setpoint and the extent to which the anaero-
bicpathway is developed in Cirolana harfordi;
2)sex and size dependence upon oxygen consumption- oxygen
tension relationships;
3) the extent of oxygen debt for each class;
4) whether incompletely -oxidized substrates are excreted into
surrounding water; and
5) what advantages anaerobiosis holds for Cirolana in a
natural environment.

Song of the Sea
dedicated to the Hopkins Marine Station
I. The Soul of Oceans
Suspect the truth, ignore the found:
These men were made to walk the ground;
And though their eyes were made to see,
The soul was never meant to be
Of ocean sizes, nor as free.
The soul of oceans dry men see
Is fitting to the hazy sky
As though we were horizon- bound
To all her shifting symmetry
In answering our salty "Why ?"
The honest need behind our reach
Is conquest, wet and dry
The sky, the sea, and all the breach
Between small night and day
Will offer but a small delay
In knowing what's behind the eye.
Song of the Sea
II.
The heavy- slinging, singing sea
In wandering skim of wind- soaked breath
Cries out her stone- high waveborne plea
In whispered warning- key of death;
And gulls in flocks, in circles, flew
The bordered blue above unfree,
While dogs in packs, in shore- lines, knew
The breaking fear of land- lined sea;
Cormorants, in their sullen glow,
Hoarded misting drops of sound;
And on the battled rocks below
The soldiered waves were foaming ground.
Above the surf, the garnered shore,
Below the circling, seeking birds
The sightless song of sea resurged
In magnitudes beneath, before:
"Make the stone to do the work
For sea; and weep, not tear;
Make fumbled rock to waste her hope
On bitter song-
Her utter strength on brute despair;
Drive the thousand- miling fetch
Through heart of sleeping rock and night
To prove in crashing, certain terms
The right of sea to scream her might.
And deep below a shal low ledge
A slivered chip of boulder's edge
Slowly spun the spiral fight.
