repair damage incurred to the shell, snails were operated on
in various ways, inflicting different types of shell damage,
as indicated in Table 2. Five individuals were operated in
each way. The holes (windows) made in the shell back of the
aperture were ground on an emery wheel, care being taken to
keep the shell wet and cool, and the internal tissues intact.
Table 2 gives the average change in each group on successive
days. The range of variation within each group was not so
great as to make the average irrelevant. In every case of
damage to the shell aperture, growth of the damaged part
proceeded faster than the growth at apertures of undamaged
controls. All such operations on the apertures were repaired
by the folds at the border of the mantle. The same was the
case with the windows over mantle cavities. New shell mater-
ial included a black prismatic layer.
When the mantle margin was slit in an otherwise undamaged
specimen, within two days a notch appeared in the shell aperture
at the point apposed to the incision. It is not clear whether
the notch was due only to lack of growth, or in part due to
active resorption of shell at the point, but wehin six days
the notch was repaired.
Snails with openings over the visceral hump first secreted
a soft, membranous layer across the inside of the hole; this
later became impregnated with calcium carbonate. Successive
layers, similar in appearance, were built up beneath the first
layer, which bulged through the opening. After thirty days
