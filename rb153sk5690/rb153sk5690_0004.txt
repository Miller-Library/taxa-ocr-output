Feppard
(April 30-May 29, 1963), one specimen had plugged the shell
window with a hard patch of white material, apparently
calcium carbonate embedded in an organic matrix. The patch
protruded through the opening like a bubble, and was translucent
at the eperiphery, opaque in the center portion. Of three
females and two males, with windows cut over the visceral
hump, the females began repair sooner than the males. None
of the snails with windows over the visceral hump died, al-
though the gonad was frequently ruptured. On the other hand,
animals wih the shell damaged by grinding a hole over the
region of the heart and kidney died in all cases except one.
Death was due not to the operation, but to the later rupture
of the kidney or pericardial sac against the sharp edge of the
opening produced by the operation. One specimen which lived
an entire month with this operation failed to successfully
repair the damage, for each time the soft membranous layer
covering the hole became embedded with calcium carbonate, it
was sloughed off through the opening.
In the "windowed" animals, even where the holes penetrated
yellow and green layers, I observed no secretion of yellow or
green material by the mantle covering the body, nor is it
secreted by the mantle margin. Secretions by other than the
mantle margin were always either transparent membranous layers
or white inorganic material. However, natural repair does
sbow yellow or green material, particularly in eroded areas at
the shell apex. Perhaps the inner layers of nacreous material
are dyed by pigments secreted by the visceral hump, specifically
