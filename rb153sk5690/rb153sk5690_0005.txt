either the digestive gland or the gonad (see MoGee, 1963a).
Cracked shells were bound firmly together in a solid unit
within five days by a calcium carbonate-embedded membrane on
the inner surface. Additional white nacreous material was laid
over the outer surface of the crack within sight days where the
break passed through the underside of the body whorl adjacent
to the shell aperture.
Summary
1. Shell erosion is caused by the activities of several animals
(bryozoans and polychaetes), by mechanical wear, and by a
fungus, which was cultured on agar plates.
Normal shell growth, recorded over a period of fifteen days
in twenty-eight animals, was intermittant, but averaged
six microns per day added to the outer lip of the aperture.
3. Repairs to shells damaged mechanically, by filing the
aperture, grinding holes in the body and upper whorls, and
by cracking in a vise are described.
