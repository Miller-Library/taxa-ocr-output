predaceous snails, boring of bryozoans and polychaetes, or
mechanical wear, all save a minority of T. funebralis(indi-
viduals measuring 5 mm or less at the greatest basal diameter)
are pitted over most of the eroded surface. Under 30x magni-
fication, this damage closely resembles that caused by a
fungus described as infesting shells of marine animals by
Bonar (1936). Attempts were made to culture the fungus on
T. funebralis on a medium of 100 ml sea water, 1 gm Caco,,
1 ml 1 M NaNo,, 1 ml 1 M KH,PO., 1.5 gm agar, 1 gm humus,
5 gm Tegula funebralig shell, finely ground, O.1% glucose,
and 0.01% yeast extract. The fungus in culture shows chlamy-
dospores (see Fig. 3) which differ from those on the species
raised by Bonar, and also from those found by Johnson (1962)
in a fungus growing on smooth jingle shells (Anomia simplex
d'Orbigny) from Pivers Island beach, North Carolina.
Normal shell growth in Tegula funebralis was measured
for a fifteen-day period (May 14-29, 1963) on individuals
ranging 13.0-27.5 mm in greatest basal diameter. Measurements
were made with an ocular micrometer of growth increments on the
outer lip of the aperture, secreted on top of a baseline of
fingernail polish painted on the edge of the aperture at the
beginning of the study. Results are shown in Table 1. The
average overall addition to shell aperture was six microna per
day, but growth occurred in spurts, not evenly each day. Total
growth over the fifteen-day period did not measurable affect
the greatest basal diameter of the shells.
In order to assess the ability of Tegula funebralis to
