Shell Growth and Repair in the Gastropod Tegula funebralis
By
Margaret Caroline Peppard
Shells of Tegula funebralig (A. Adams, 1854) inhabiting
the intertidal areas of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California,
are rarely found to have more than four whorls, irrespective
of the size of the snail, due to heavy erosion of the upper
parts. Questioning the nature of repair of erosion damage led
to a consideration of the more general question of shell repair
in T. funebralis. Fretter and Graham (1962) discuss shell form-
ation in prosobranch molluscs, but little is understood of shell
repair mechanisms.
Eegla funebralis lives in what is essentially a tapered
tube, closed at the small end. This is clearly seen in Figs.
1 and 2. Macroscopically, there are three layers in the shell.
The thin, transparent periostracum on Mussel Point specimens is
present only on the body whorl near the shell aperture, if at all.
Underlying the periostracum is a black prismatic layer. These
two layers are secreted only by the mantle margin. Innermost
is a thick nacreous layer, white over most areas, but sometimes
yellow or greenish in the upper whorls. Slides of decalcified
shells embedded in paraffin show the laminar character of the
nacreous matrix.
Most of the specimens of Tagula funebralis from Mussel
Point have shells which are conspicuously eroded. Although
some of the erosion appears to be due to the radular action of
