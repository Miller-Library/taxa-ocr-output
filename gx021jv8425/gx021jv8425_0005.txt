Animals were placed in the observation tank over a three-day
period. The tank was round, with a diameter of Sm and a depth of
SOcm, and was on a running seawater system. The bottom was
coyered with sand in an attempt to mimic the animal's natural
Habitat, and bricks, cement blocks, and jars were scattered around
the tank for homes; there were always more available homes than
there were octopuses. The octopuses were fed small crabs, a type
of prey common in their natural environment. They were fed every
day, about1.Ssmall crab per octopus per day.
Octopus rubescens is nocturnal (Hochberg and Fields, 1780).
and for ease of observation the animal's daily light cycle was
reversed, with the tank darkened during natural daylight hours
(O800 - 1800) and lit with flood lights from 1800 - O800.
The 24-hour day was braken up into 2-hour periods, and
zeveral perinds of abservations were made every day.
Opprokimately 75 hours of observations were made during the cours
of the study. Observations were made in the dark, with only a
small amount of light entering through the walls of the room --
enough light to enable the observer to identify the animals after
dark-adapting for a few minutes, but dark enough that a small
flashlight had to be used for taking notes. The observer sat on
stool beside the tank, sometimes walking quietly around the room
to clusely watch interactions. The octopuses quickly habituated
to this situation and showed mo response to the movement of the
Ebserver. A written commentary was recorded where each octopus
spent its resting time, where and when it moved, how it interactet
with ather animals, and its body patterns during activity.
