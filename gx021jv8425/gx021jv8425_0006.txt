Photographs were occasionally taken with a Fentax K-1000 camera
with flash.

Levels of activity
For the first two weeks the octopuses were fed at the
beginning of the subjective night (0800), and a daily cycle of
activity emerged (see Figure 1). Activity levels were calculated
by measuring the percentage of each half-hour period that each
animal was moving about the tank, then averaging all animals and
all observations for that period.
When ted at 0800, octopus activity reached a sharp peak
during the half-hour of feeding, corresponding with the animals
moving about the tank hunting the crabs. Immediately following
feeding activity dropped to almost zero for about 1 1/2 hours.
presumably corresponding with the time taken to kill and eat one
or more crabs. Activity then resumed and was maintained at an
elevated level throughout the subjective night, dropped sharply
when the lights were turned on at 1800, and remained low
throughout the subjective day.
For the third and fourth weeks of the study, the animals were
fed during their subjective day at 2400 in an attempt to see to
what extent the change in time of feeding would disrupt the
activity cycle found above. On the new feeding schedule (see
