winner was the largest animal in the tank, and most of the other
octopuses never lost an encounter with an animal smaller than
itself. Ihis suggests a hierarchy of dominance based on sise, in
which larger animals win encounters with smaller animals (Table 2)
Only in the two smallest animals, 7 and 3, did this patterr
not hold true. This may be due to individual characteristics
(e.g. trauma) of these particular animals, to chance because of
the small number of encounters between the animals (1), or to the
fact that 47 was female and may have been evading a mating attempt
by 45, a male. In single-sex interactions, however, a linear
pattern of dominance based on size is very clear.
Territoriality
The tank was divided into 12 sectors, o around the walls of
the tank and a corresponding with homes in the center (Figure 3).

was measured (Table 3). No obvious pattern initially
emerged: while 1 spent all of his resting time in one sector of
the tank, the others distributed their time among several
different areas. to, however, spent most of her resting time in
sectors VIII and IX, which are adjacent to each other and could,
combined, be called a territory. Using only level of occupancy as
a criterion for territoriality, it appears that only fi and
possibly 46 spend enough time in a single area to term it a
territory.
Ongther criterion is whether or not the octopus defends the
area in which it spends the most time. To measure this, the win
