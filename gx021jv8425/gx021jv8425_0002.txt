Introduction
Octopuses are highly evolved invertebrates with a large
degree of intelligence, and have been the subject of numerous
studies of learning and nervous system function. Despite the
extensive literature that has been developed on the learning and
physiology of the genus, however, very little is known about the
behayior or ecology of octopuses. Examining the ways in which an
octopus interacts with others of its species, and how it makes use
of its time and living space in a laboratory or semi-natural
setting may provide us with clues about the ecology of the species
in the field.
There is especially little information available on the
behavior of Octopus rubescens, a small benthic cephalopod that is
found along the Facific coast of Morth America from Baja
California to British Columbia. In Monterey Bay, California,
where this study was carried out, C. rubescens is known to spend
brief period in the plankton after hatching, then settle as
juveniles in the kelp forest before migrating further oftshore to
sandy mud bottoms (Hochberg and Fields, 1980).
The only published research available on behavior in U.
rubescens was performed by Warren, Scheier, and Riley (1974), who
described the color changes observed during attacks on conditione
and unconditioned stimuli. They found many of the same patterns
described by Packard and Sanders (1971) for Octopus yulgaris, but
defined the color changes during the attack sequence as systemati
and independent of background coloration. They concluded that the
color changes that occur during feeding are so strongly associated
