Ocknowledgments
I'd like to thank my advisor, Chuck Baxter, for his advice, for
proyiding access to his seemingly limitless knowledge of things
scientific, and for coming through with unsolicited (but much
appreciated) help at the most frustrating points in the research
process. John Kono was an invaluable ally in the construction and
reconstruction of my elaborate tanks. Carol Marzoula came through
whenever I needed help, and I appreciate her long hours on the
water pulling up octopus pots as well as her long hours in the
water looking for octopus pots. Stuart Thompson helped many
in the course by buoying spirits when stress was at its highest,
and the other professors helped make this quarter my most
satisfying at Stanford. I'm grateful, too, to the six charismatic
octopuses in my study for allowing me to put them in a tank, mees
up their cycles, and force them to make small talk.
Ond finally, I'd like to thank that "socially interactive" group,
the students of Bio 17SH 1987, for ... whatever it is you thank
yeur friends for.
