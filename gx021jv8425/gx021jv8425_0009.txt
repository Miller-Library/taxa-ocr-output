loss record and the number of encounters involving the animal in
each sector were weighed against the amount of time the animal
spent in that sector (Table 4). Again, no clear pattern is
shown. It appears that the amount of time spent in an area is not
necessarily related to the number or success of encounters in that
area. However, almost half of all the encounters in the tank toom
place in sectors XI, XII, and VII -- the sector in which fi, the
dominant animal, made his home and the two sectors adjacent to it.
All of the encounters that occurred in sector XII that involved
animal 41 took place when 1 was forcing another animal from his
home, or rebutting an attempt by another animal to enter the home
while he was occupying it. In addition, although relatively tew
encounters occurred in sectors VIII and XI, where  (the second
dominant octopus) spent most of her time,  both initiated and
won every encounter that took place there. All of these facts
indicate that 1 and t6 may be defending territories. None of the
avidence shows, though, that any of the smaller animals were
actively defending territories.
Color Fatterns
Observations of color patterns were largely casual, made
during the course of observations of interactions and teeding.
Many different patterns were seen, including many of the body
patterns cataloqued by Packard and Sanders (1971) in their study
of Octopus vulgaris. Particular attention was paid to pattern
changes during interaction, but relatively few color changes were
obseryed. The octopuses were usually uniformly pale green
