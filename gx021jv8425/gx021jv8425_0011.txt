Ihe activity levels found for Octopus rubescens are those one
would expect to find in a nocturnal species, and are similar to
those found in Octopus vulgaris by Wells, O'Dor, Mangold, and
Wells (1983). The results show that the daily light cycle of the
animals can be successfully reversed. This is especially
interesting in view of the fact that nearly all of the many
studies made on learning in Octopus species have been carried out
in the daytime in normal daytime light levels, when the animal
would normally be fairly inactive. Wells et al. (1983) feel that
"behayioural experiments may be underestimating the capacities of
the animal by testing its abilities during the wrong time of day."
Heversing the daily light cycle of the octopus in the study could
dive more accurate results in behavioral or learning researcn
without reversing the diurnal cycle of the researcher.
In a semi-natural situation, D. rubescens showed interaction
patterns that could be called a dominance hierarchy and is
probably based on size. This finding is in keeping with Varnalle
(1967) obseryation of a dominance hierarchy in O. cyanea and with
Hather's (1980) similar findings in O. joubini. A hierarchy in
some form may be common to all Octopus species, as Nather
suggested, but the strength of the hierarchy may well be ditterent
in the field than it is in the semi-crowded conditions in the
laboratory.
Yarnall (1949) and Mather (1780) found that the species of
octopus they studied showed no territoriality; Dorsey concluded
