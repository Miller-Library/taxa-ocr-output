with the animal's motor activity as to be inevitable.
The only other study specifically involving Octopus rubescens
was detailed in an unpublished thesis by Dorsey (1976). Dorsey
studied the natural history and social behavior of the species in
Washington and concluded that the animals set up a dominance
hierarchy based on size; she found no evidence that the animals
established territorities. Because of the small size (12Ocm
SOcm icm) of her tanks, however, her results may have been
influenced by crowding. More research on the species is clearly
needed before the its social organization can be definitively
described.
Frevious research on social behavior in other Octopus specie:
has been limited, but two other studies have examined the types of
social orgainization in laboratory octopus populations. Yarnall
(1967) observed Octopus cyanea in large, semi-natural holding
ponds in Hawaii. He found that the octopuses did not appear to
defend territories, but set up a hierarchy in which
smaller animals yielded to larger ones. Mather's (1980) study of
Octopus joubini examined the use of space by the individuals in
the her tank. Occupancy of all areas were not randomly
distributed, but Mather concluded that the species was not
territorial because the animals did not exclude one another from
preferred areas of the tank. She, too, found that the octopuses
showed patterns similar to those found in dominance hierarchies.
Hanning (1972) defines a territory as 'any defended area.
In order to determine whether Octopus rubescens organizes itselt
into territories, several aspects of its behavior must be studied:
