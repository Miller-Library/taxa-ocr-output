Io study how the species organizes its time, space, and
social structure in a semi-natural situation, a group of sik
Octopus rubescens were kept in a Sm diameter tank for one month.
Observations were made of the win-loss record of each animal in
interactions with other members of the group, the time spent by
each animal in the different areas of the tank, and the various
color patterns displayed by the animals in different situations.
A pattern of dominance based on size emerged in which larger
animals won encounters with smaller animals. The establishment
and defense of a territory by at least one individual in the group
sudgested territoriality for the species. Several color patterns
were seen that did not fit previously published reports of typical
patterns in the species, and imply that the literature on body
patterning in octopuses is neither complete nor absolute.
