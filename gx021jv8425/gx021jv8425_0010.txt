throughout the encounter, whether it was a simple approach, a
touch, or a fight.
Occasionally, however, the initiator and eventual winner of
an encounter assume an aggressive posture and pattern similar to
that pictured in Figure 4a. The posture is upright; the color is
uniformly green or mottled with dark bars extending from below
each eye to the upper arms. In these encounters, the submissive
animal would assume a defensive posture (Figure 4b) with arme
curled underneath it; dark rings would sometimes appear around the
eyes. These patterns were not consistent with any particular
animals and could not be predicted to occur in any particular
situation.
During feeding, the color change sequence described by Warren
et al. (1774) was often observed. In this sequence, the octopus
is crawling or sitting in the tank before detection of the prey
item, and exhibits one of many patterns. Upon detection and
during a free-swimming attack, the animal assumes a color ranging
from light orange to grey, then turns completely colorless upon
landing. While seising the prey, the octopus is spotted or
mottled, then returns to one of a variety of patterns while
eating. Sometimes, though, no color change whatsoever occurred
during the attack on a prey item, and sometimes the animal flushed
a dark red at the moment of attack rather than blanching. Again,
the occurence of the pattern sequence was not predictable.
