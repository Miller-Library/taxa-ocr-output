Figure 2), the activity level maintained its nocturnal character.
The activity pattern associated with feeding was translocated to
the new feeding time in the subjective day, but was otherwise
unchanged. During the subjective night there was a 2-hour period
of high activity following the onset of darkness, then a drop in
activity follpwed by an increasing pulse of activity that wae
again terminated by the lights turning back on. From this data it
appears that the octopuses' daily cycle can be disrupted but not
reyersed simply by feeding during their normal resting hours.
Interactions
Ihree types of interactions were observed: a) approach -- an
octopus crauls or swims toward another, and the second octopue
crawls or zwims away before contact is made; b) touch -- an
actopus crawls or swims to another and touches the second animal
with the guter half of one or several arms, and either animal
crauls or swims away; and c) fight - an octopus crawls or swims
to another and both animals grapple arms, trying to cover each
cther with their interbrachial webs, and either animal crawis or
suims away. No discrimination was made in the analysis of the
different types of interaction; any time one animal ceded space to
another it was recorded as an encounter and went into those
animals' win-loss records.
For each animal a win-loss record was tabulated and compared
with the others (Table 1). One animal was a predominant
winner, one lost all of its encounters, and the others won every
encounter against certain animals and always lost to others. he
