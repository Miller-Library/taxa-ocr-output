that U. rubescens was not territorial, but her results may have
been affected by crowding. In the less crowded situation of this
study, at least one individual O. rubescens showed clear signs of
territoriality and a second showed what could be described as a
sott' territory. It's obvious that the animals didn't ewhibit a
rigid territoriality in the sense that every animal defends and it
dominant in a specific area, but the clear territoriality of one
or more animals suggests territoriality for the species as a
whole.
It should be noted that octopus 1, the dominant and
territorial animal in the tank, was also the most active and wideÂ¬
ranging of all the octopuses. He wandered frequently all gyer the
tank, winning encounters wherever he went. It may be that his
dominance and range of activity had an inhibitory effect on the
other animals, preventing them from establishing territories.
Ihis possibility should be tested by the removal of the dominant
animal trom the tank to see how the use of space by the other
animals in the tank is affected. If the territory of animal to
becomes more rigid, or if the other animals begin to form
territories as the tank becomes less crowded, the species could be
said to be fairly strongly territorial, with the activity of the
dominant animal having a substantial influence on the
territoriality of the smaller animals.
In locking for a type of social organization in her study,
Mather (1980) assumed that dominance hierarchies and
territoriality precluded each other, that one population could not
display both types of organization: "...presumably it could be
either a territorial pattern, in which each animal defends a piece
