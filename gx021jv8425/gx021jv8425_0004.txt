a) how much time does each individual spend in the different areas
of the tank? and b) does each animal 'defend' the area in which it
spends the most time?
Ony laboratory situation, of course, is only a poor
substitute for field research, but the use of a semi-natural
setting may provide us with a fairly accurate view of octopus
behavior. By setting up a large tank with a simulated natural
environment, obseryations can be made that may help develup an
outline of octopus social organization.
Materials and Hethods
Octopus rubescens were collected from the sandy bottom of
Honterey Bay, California by setting bottle traplines. All animale
were collected from within cne-half mile of Monterey harbor, and
from a depth of approximately 50 feet. In the laboratory, they
were weighed and tagged with colored wire. Sexes were determined
by lightly anaesthetizing the animals with a solution of 1.57
ethanol in seawater and inverting the mantle of each animal and
examining the gonads. In the case of the two largest males, this
process was not necessary because enlarged prowimal suckers and
hectocotyluses were easily visible on these animals. Four males
and three females were originally placed in the tank; one male
crauled out of the tank and died after only one day, and the study
included data from only the six animals present in the tank
throughout the study.
