Introduction
++-
Neomachilis halophila Silvestri, 1911, originally
described from beaches near San Fransisco, is common
under rocks and in crevices in the high intertidal zone
on California beaches (W.G. Evans 1972, personal communi¬
cation). I have found it most abundant just on the sea¬
ward side of the last terrestrial vegetation in areas
covered with rocks too high on the beach to be disturbed
by most high tides,and especially among rocks piled in
such a manner that a small space occurs between rock and
sand. Little is known of the natural history of this
species. The present study deals with population struc-
ture, diurnal rhythm of activity, and food. All Obser-
vations were carried out near Pacific Grove, California,
