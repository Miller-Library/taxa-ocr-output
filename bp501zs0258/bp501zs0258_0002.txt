at sites on Pt. Pinos and on Mussel Point near the Hopkins
Marine Station, in April and May, 1972.
Population Structure
One hundred thirty five specimens were collected at
Pt. Pinos May 19 and 20. In the laboratory they were an¬
esthetized with ether, sexed, and measured under a dis¬
secting microscope. Females were determined by the pre¬
sence of the elongate ovipositor extending from the eigth
and ninth segments (Lubbock, 1873). Length was measured
from the tip of the head to the posterior end of the abdo-
men, excluding caudal cerci and filament. The results are
shown in Figure 1. Males and females occur in approxi¬
mately equal numbers, but large females are larger than the
largest males. A marked discontinuity in size is seen in
the population. Many juveniles, no longer that 3.5mm, are
present, but the next shortest size class begins at 8.lmm.
In a Californian Lepismid studied by Lasker (1956), sea-
sonal breeding was reported, eggs being found only in April
and May. The discontinuity observed in the present study
suggests a similary limited breeding period, in late winter
or early spring. The numerous juveniles were found right
along with the much larger animals.
