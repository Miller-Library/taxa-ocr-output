O
nalophila remained at rest, mainly on undersides of rocks,
in daytime; at night thoy were more active, and were found
crawling on sand beneath rocks and on the upper surfaces
of rocks. Activity patterns of the population were deter-
mined in two 24-hour periods of regularly repeated field
observation, one carried out at Pt. Pinos and the other
at Mussel Point. At Pt. Pinos, two areas of about 30
square feet each were marked off and examined every 2 or
3 hours for location and number of Neomachilig. At Mussel

Point on site of approximately 30 square feet was similar¬
ly observed. At each observation time animals were cat¬
egorized as either 1) stationary on undersurfaces of rocks,
2) crawling on sand beneath and around rocks, of 3) crawl-
ing on the tops of rocks. The results can be seen in Fig¬
ure 2. The increase in total number seen, decrease in
+.
number on undersullaces of rocks, and increase in number
on sand and on tops of rocks, all indicate that the activ¬
ity of Neomachilis halophila increases with the coming of
darkness, reaches a peak shortly before sunrise, and de¬
clines rapidly at dawn. The early morning peak in activ¬
ity coincides with the period of heaviest dew fall (S.
Johnson, 1972, personal communication).
Food and Feeding
Food studies were carried out on animals collected
m-
at Pt. Pinos May 25 and 26, and Emmediately preserved in
3.
