Summary
Neomachilis halophila inhabits the spaces beneath rocks
of the upper beach and shore areas just below the land
vegetation. Males and females occur in equal numbers, but
large females are larger than large males. Activity is
largely nocturnal, and greatest activity occurs just before
dawn. Common foods include unicellular green algae (from
++-
lichens), yeast, pine pollen, and vegetable detritus.
Most feeding occurs during the predawn period of greatest
activity.
