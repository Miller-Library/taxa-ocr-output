958 alcohol. In the laboratory animals were decapitated
and the whole alimentary canal removed as described by
Lasker (1956). Intestinal contents were removed, mount¬
ed in glycerine, and examined under a compound microscope.
Major categories of food were determined qualitatively.
Six samples of ten animals each were taken over a 16.5
hour period to observe any changes in quantity and nature
of the gut contents.
The results (Figures 3 and 4) show a fair variety of
material occur in the gut of Neomachilis halophila. Uni-
cellular green algae, yeast, and pine pollen are materials
most often found. The unicellular algae are derived from
an encrusting lichen growing on the upper surfaces of the
rocks under which Neomachilis is found. The probable
source of the pollen is the Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata),
the most abundant tree near Pacific Grove shores, and a
+++
species which produces large quantitles of wind-borne pol¬
len in late winter and early spring. The source of the
yeast is unknown. The other materials found represent
common high beach detritus. In 22% of the animals,
spor
ozoans (Gregarindae) were found in the gut, in numbers
from 2 to 36. The largest numbers of animals with guts
partly or wholly filled were found in early morning, in¬

dicating that feeding tends to occur during periods of
greatesthactivity.
