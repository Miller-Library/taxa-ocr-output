Examination of the untransformed data indicates that, on average, strength varies by 40-50% and
cross-sectional area by 25-35% over just the small range of drags sampled in this study. Thus,
despite the high degree of variation in these graphs and the lack of predictive power they imply,
differences in strength and cross-sectional area across a drag gradient could still be of biological
importance for individuals of this species.
Comparison with data from Carrington (1990):
Many of the results of this study corroborate the previous work of Emily Carrington
(1990), also at Hopkins Marine Station. A brief comparison between these data sets is outlined
in Table 2. The difference in percentage of holdfast failures might be explained by the different
times of year our studies were conducted (I sampled during springtime while Carrington
collected her data during the winter). The effects of seasonal changes on the properties of M.
papillatus have yet to be examined. Carrington and I also report significantly different mean
cross-sectional areas (student’s t-test with unequal variances, P = 0.005). Since 1 find that cross-
sectional area varies with wave environment, this difference may be due to a higher average drag
for Carrington’s samples. Carrington’s study did not include drag values, however, so this
hypothesis cannot be tested. No significant difference was detected between our values for mean
stipe strength (student's t-test with unequal variances, P2 0.10).
Carrington also found no effect of collection site on stipe strength, despite the fact that
she collected in three sites she considered protected, exposed, and intermediate. There are
several possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy between her findings and mine.
Possibly the wave force variation between these sites was not as great as Carrington had
expected (recall that she did not have access to accurate water velocity measurements at the time
