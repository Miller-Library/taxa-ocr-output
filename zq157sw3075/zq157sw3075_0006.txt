area inaccurate, or (5) no planform area measurements were possible due to the condition of the
sample or the degree of branching or bushiness. A summary of the number of samples discarded
for each of these reasons appears in Table 1. Additionally, approximately three times during the
course of data collection blades were encountered that were too small and had too high of a
break force to be removed from the substratum with my attachment procedures. These blades
could not be sampled.
Calculations.
The material strength of each blade was calculated by dividing the breaking force for that
sample by the cross-sectional area over which the break occurred.
Drag for each sample was modeled with the standard relationship
D=½ pU’SC
where p is the density of seawater (nominally 1025 kg/ m2), U is water velocity in m/s, S is
planform or projected area in m’ and Ca, a function of velocity, represents the coefficient of drag
for M. papillatus. The Ca used for this study was taken from Carrington (1990), who calculated
the drag coefficient of M. papillatus as
Ca=0.156 U 0367

Carrington also noted that this standard model of drag accounted for 75.8% of variation in drag
for the 60 samples she examined. The addition of nine other morphological parameters,
