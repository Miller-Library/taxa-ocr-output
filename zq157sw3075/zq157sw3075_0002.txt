Introduction:
The effects of crashing waves almost certainly represent one of the most important
environmental variables affecting life on rocky shores. Of all the organisms that inhabit the
intertidal zone of rocky headlands, sessile macroalgae face particularly great challenges in
dealing with the effects of wave force. With no ability to "run and hide" during large wave
events and a generally low material strength relative to other biological materials (Denny et. al
1989), algal distribution and abundance often appear to be constrained by conditions of wave
force. The question of whether algal populations respond to this variation in wave intensity with
morphological or mechanical adjustments remains both open and intriguing.
Previous laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that some species of brown algae
(Ochrophyta, class Phaeophyceae) exhibit a considerable degree of mechanical plasticity in
response to differing exposure conditions (Charters et al. 1969, Armstrong 1987, McEacheron &
Thomas 1987, Kraemer & Chapman 1991b, Johnson & Koehl 1994, Milligan & DeWreede
2000). Within the red algae (Rhodophyta), differences in both biomass and planform area
between exposed and protected sites have been observed (Carrington 1990, Pratt & Johnson
2002). Variation in breaking force, cross-sectional area, and strength along a wave exposure
gradient, however, has never before been demonstrated for a species of intertidal red algae.
In this study, I assess the response of an intertidal red alga, Mastocarpus papillatus, to
varying conditions of wave exposure. In an attempt to uncover weak trends that may have not
been detectable in previous studies, I take a novel approach to the measure of "wave exposure.
Whereas prior work has focused on differences in algal properties between groups of individuals
