including patterns of branching and papillae density, only explained an additional 9% of the
variation, and as such were not included in the model of drag for this study. This equation for Ca
takes into account the reconfiguration in flow (a decrease in projected area) of M. papillatus.
Relevant water velocities were calculated using the relationships between offshore
significant wave height and water velocity at each dynamometer site derived by Helmuth and
Denny (2003). A pressure transducer deployed offshore at HMS recorded significant wave
height data four times per day for a forty-day period just prior to the beginning of this study. The
average of the greatest one-third of these wave heights (129.5 cm) was used to calculate relevant
water velocities at each site. Relevant water velocity thus provides a measure of the average
stressful water velocities experienced by M. papillatus thalli at each site over the forty days prior
to the beginning of this study.
Systat 8.0 was used for plots and statistical analysis. For all linear regression
calculations, R* represents adjusted squared multiple R and probabilities are reported for the
outcome of a 2-tailed student’s t-test.
Results:
Of the 233 total samples collected, 121 were retained for data analysis. Departures from
normality were corrected in all data sets (cross-sectional area, breaking force, strength, and drag)
with log-transformations prior to linear regression calculations.
Linear regressions show significant positive relationships between drag and breaking
force (Fig. 1, R2 = 0.212, P «0.001), drag and cross-sectional area (Fig. 2, R“ = 0.048, P -
0.009), and drag and strength (Fig. 3, R° = 0.053, P = 0.007). Cross-sectional area and breaking
force (Fig. 4, R2 = 0.2531, P « 0.001) and strength and breaking force (Fig. 5, R° = 0.271, P«
