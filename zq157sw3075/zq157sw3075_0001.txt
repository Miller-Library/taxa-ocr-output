Abstract:
Intertidal algae are exposed to potentially severe environmental forces on a daily basis.
One of the most important of these is the pressure drag generated by crashing waves, the
magnitude of which is determined by the interaction of water velocity and an algaâ€™s projected
area. This study addresses the effects of drag on the morphological and mechanical properties of
the common intertidal red alga Mastocarpus papillatus. Breaking force of the stipe is positively
correlated with drag, indicating morphological and/or mechanical differences between exposed
and protected individuals of this species. Stipe cross-sectional area and material strength are
both positively correlated with drag as well as with breaking force, suggesting that an individual
blade may be adjusting both of these parameters in response to its mechanical environment. A
single blade does not, however, appear to increase both of these factors simultaneously, as stipe
cross-sectional area and strength are negatively correlated. Thus, I find that M. papillatus
responds to increased drag by either increasing its stipe diameter or its tissue strength, but not
both. The range of variation in these two properties remains small when compared to the overall
natural variability within the population.
