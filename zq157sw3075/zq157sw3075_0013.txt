where A is thallus area in m’ and U is water velocity in m/s. This relationship can be seen
graphically in Fig. 7. I predict the maximum, wave-limited thallus area of M. papillatus to be
approximately twice as high as Carrington (1990)
Conclusion:
Mastocarpus papillatus shows statistically significant increases in breaking force, cross¬
sectional area and strength with an increase in drag, although there is substantial variation about
this trend. This is the first time that relationships of this type have been reported for any alga of
the order Rhodophyta, which may be explained by my examination of these three relationships
along a continuous drag gradient instead of between sites of qualitatively different wave
exposure
Attention should be paid to the possible biological explanations behind these
relationships, especially to the relationship between strength and drag. Possible chemical or
physical variation within M. papillatus tissue itself, particularly in the cell wall composition,
might help explain this relationship and should be examined. The inverse relationship between
strength and cross-sectional area remains unexplained as well, and investigations should be
directed towards examining the question of whether the stipe tissue of M. papillatus might in fact
be heterogeneous with regards to strength. Future investigators might be advised to attempt to
control for age of the individuals.
