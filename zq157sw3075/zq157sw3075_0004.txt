correlated, suggesting that an individual may have a higher cross-sectional area or a higher tissue
strength in response to wave forces, but not both.

Species and location.
Mastocarpus papillatus is perhaps the most common intertidal red alga along the central
California coast (Abbot & Hollenberg 1976). M. papillatus grows in semi-erect clumps with
multiple thalli emerging from a single holdfast. In this study, a single thallus was taken as the
sampling unit. Thallus location within a clump was not considered as a factor in analysis.
Although clumping has been shown to reduce drag in the related alga Chondrus crispus,
Carrington (1990) found only mild drag reducing interactions between groups of up to six
closely packed M. papillatus thalli. In the field, large clumps of more than approximately a
dozen densely packed individuals were not encountered in sampling.
Samples were collected from six sites along the rocky intertidal of Hopkins Marine
Station (HMS), Pacific Grove, California (36’37’ N, 121°54’ W). Sites were separated by a
minimum of 10 m and were all located at approximately 1.5 ft above MLLW. All sites were
located within 1 m* of locations at which dynamometers had previously been used to measure
wave-induced forces (Bell & Denny 1994, Helmuth & Denny 2003). This allowed water
velocity estimates to be made for each collection site.
