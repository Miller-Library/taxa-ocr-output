Data collection:
Thalli were collected during springtime low tides from April through June 2003.
Samples were fully hydrated before all experimental procedures to control for the possible
effects of desiccation. Samples were selected that had a lack of obvious holes, tears, rotten areas,
and other imperfections that could affect the breaking force, and each sample had a low to
moderate degree of blade branching, as extensive branching patterns made accurate
measurements of projected area difficult.
Blades were isolated from their neighbors and grasped with either a small alligator clip
lined with rubber tubing or a small string with a slipknot. The clamp or string was then attached
to either a 500 g or 1000 g recording spring scale (resolution of -0.05 N) and pulled with a
steady force intended to separate the blade from the substratum within approximately 1 second.
A small slider on the scale recorded the maximum force at which the thallus broke.
All analyzed samples broke just above the holdfast at the lower part of the stipe. The
diameter of the stipe at the breaking point was measured for each sample with a dissecting scope
and ocular micrometer (resolution of -25 um). Cross-sectional area at the breaking point was
estimated as the area of a circle having this diameter. Each sample blade was then flattened
under a sheet of clear acrylic and digitally photographed. The planform area of each sample was
calculated using ImageJ, an image analysis program distributed by the Research Services Branch
of the NIH (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij)
Any sample that met one or more of the following criteria was discarded: (1) the holdfast
of the alga failed before the stipe tissue, (2) a break occurred at some location along the blade
rather than along the stipe, (3) the stipe was irregular, deformed, rotten, or damaged, (4) the
break occurred at the point of connection for two stipes, making measurements of cross-sectional
-5.
