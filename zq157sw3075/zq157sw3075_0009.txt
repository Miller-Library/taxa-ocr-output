papillatus, Carrington (1990) found no significant relationship between collection site and stipe
strength between one “exposed", one "protected", and one "intermediate exposure" site.
The increase in breaking force, cross-sectional area, and strength with increasing drag
shown here may be the result of either selective forces acting on the population as a whole (by
removing weak individuals) or plastic responses to increased drag forces within an individual
thallus. Further investigations will be needed to determine which of these two is actually
occurring for M. papillatus.
Strength and Cross-sectional area:
Figure 6 shows a relatively strong negative correlation between cross-sectional area and
strength. This result corroborates published work on the related red algae Chondrus crispus and
Mastocarpus stellatus (Dudgeon & Johnson 1992). It appears that for M. papillatus as well as
these other red algae, growth in stipe diameter outpaces the corresponding increase in stipe
strength. The biological explanation for this phenomenon remains unknown, although suggested
mechanisms in other algae include tissue differentiation in thick stipes (Koehl & Wainwright
1977), tissue weakening with age, endophytic infections, grazing, scarring, or general damage
due to repeated stress over time (Dudgeon & Johnson 1992).
The relationship shown in Figure 6 may also suggest that perhaps that the stipe tissue of
M. papillatus is not homogenous with regards to strength. The majority of the stipe’s strength
may be found, for example, in the outer ring of the stipe where the smaller, denser
photosynthetic cells of the plant are concentrated (Gabrielson et. al 2000). As stipe radius, r,
increases, the cross-sectional area increases as ar’ while the circumference of the stipe increases
