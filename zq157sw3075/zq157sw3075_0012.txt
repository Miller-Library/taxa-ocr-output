of her study). Additionally, cross-sectional area clearly has an impact on measurements of
strength (Fig. 6), and Carrington’s failure to control for stipe diameter in her strength
comparisons may have confounded her results. Her experimental design, utilizing “exposed,
"intermediate," and "protected" sites, may also not have had the resolution necessary to detect
these relatively weak relationships. Additional variation between my results and Carrington's
could also be explained by the greater resolution of my data set: I measured breaking force to the
nearest 0.05 N and cross-sectional diameter to the nearest 25 um. Carrington measured these
two quantities to the nearest 1 N and 50 um, respectively.
Carrington also found no significant relationship between her untransformed data relating
cross-sectional area and thallus planform area (P2 0.05). In my log-transformed data set, I also
observe a non-significant relationship between these two quantities (R° = 0.023, P = 0.054).
Carrington used this conclusion to extrapolate to a model of the maximum planform area of a
blade at a given water velocity, assuming that this planform area is the only parameter that might
vary systematically with water velocity. While cross-sectional area may not vary with frontal
area, I find here that both stipe cross-sectional area and strength vary positively with drag (Figs.
2 and 3) as does breaking force (Fig. 1)
These results indicate that Carrington’s model for calculating maximum thallus size for
M. papillatus in a given wave environment may need to be reconsidered. Combining the linear
regression equation of breaking force and drag (Fig. 1) with Carrington's standard model for
drag, the maximum thallus area for a given water velocity is given by:
A=0.125 U-1633
