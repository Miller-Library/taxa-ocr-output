0.001) are also positively correlated. Cross-sectional area and strength are inversely related, as
seen in Fig. 6 (R° = 0.209, P « 0.001).
Discussion:
Relationships along a drag gradient.
We can see in Fig. 1 that breaking force for M. papillatus increases with increasing drag,
implying that these algae are in some way responding to their wave environments through
modifications of their morphological or material properties. The question then becomes what
factors might explain this positive relationship. Figs. 2 and 4 together show that one possible
explanation for this effect lies in an increase in stipe cross-sectional area (from these
relationships, an increase in drag implies to an increase in cross-sectional area, and an increase in
cross-sectional area implies an increase in breaking force). Figs. 3 and 5 demonstrate a second
possible explanation. As drag increases, the material strength of the stipe tissue of M. papillatus
also increases, and as stipe strength increases breaking force increases as well.
The observed increases in stipe breaking force, cross-sectional area, and strength with
drag stand in contrast to the results of Pratt & Johnson (2002) and Carrington (2001). These
studies found no significant relationships between these three variables and wave exposure for
the related algae Mastocarpus stellatus and Chondrus crispus using the previously described
“exposed site" and "protected site" experimental design. Working with these same two species,
Johnson & Dudgeon (1992) report evidence that high wave exposure and freezing actually
weakens (lowers the strength of) the stipes of C. crispus and M. stellatus. Working with M.
