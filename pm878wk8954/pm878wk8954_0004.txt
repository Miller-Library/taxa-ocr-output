Part I: Field Studies
In order to determine the habitat of the P. Scaber populat-
ion I studied, hourly temperature and humidity measurements were
taken in the field for a period of two days. The results are
shown in fig. 1. "Within habitat" temperatures were taken with
a thermistor probe implanted where the aggregation of isopods
was found. "Above habitat" temperatures were taken ten cent-
imeters above the location of the population. The mean "in
habitat" relative humidity was 93% with a range of 87% to 96%.
A study of the size differences between males and females
indicated that a large dimorphism was present. From these
results (fig. 2) I decided to study males only, to exclude
respiration differences brought about by sex alone.
Part II: L.T. 50 Measurements
The apparatus used consisted of a constant temperature
bath, accurate to within .2 degrees centigrade in which a
test chamber containing the isopods was immersed. A moist-
ened piece of filter paper placed in the chamber ensured a
high humidity during the tests. Each test was carried out with
ten randomly selected animals of one acclimation group, for a
period of one hour. For each group, three temperatures were
found which produced mortalities between 10% and 90%. The
results are plotted on probit paper with a log temperature
scale. (fig. 3). The control group was found to have signif-
icantly higher L.T. 50 levels than the other two groups, but
