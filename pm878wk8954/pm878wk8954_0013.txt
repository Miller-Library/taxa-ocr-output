Part IV: Discussion
Many error terms were present in the experimental method
which could have been eliminated. Larger vessels, perhaps of
aquarium size, could have been used for the lab populations
to ensure that crowding did not cause behavioral modifications.
The control population should have been enclosed in a vessel
identical to those used for the lab population. More data should
have been collected for the L.D. 50 calculations.
