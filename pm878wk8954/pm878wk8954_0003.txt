Methods
For the habitat study, relative humidity was measured with
a portable Honeywell relative humidity indicator. The probe
was placed under the iceplant, where the population of isopods
was found. Humidity measurements were recorded hourly for
the two day study period. This data was used to ascertain
a mean humidity value to be used for the lab populations.
Acclimation studies were carried out on animals subjected
to a constant temperature of either 5, 15, or 25 degrees C.
for a period of two weeks. Edney (1964) indicated that for the
genus Porcellio this length of time was sufficient for total
acclimation to occur. The animals were placed in small glass
habitats, one habitat per temperature and 100 animals per
habitat. Constant high humidity was ensured by placing water
resevoirs in the bottom of each enclosure.
Other methods used in the experimental technique and analysis
will be discussed in the appropriate sections.
