Introduction
Acclimation' with respect to temperature is a widespread,
species-specific phenomenon, and has been studies extensively
by many previous researchers. (Edney, 1964, Edney, 1961, Prosser,
1961). In a study of Porcellio Laevus by Edney (1964), no sig-
nificant acclimation was found with respect to respiration
measurements. Significant results were obtained for P. Laevus
when lethal temperature measurements were carried out, however,
and the differences were thought to be attributable to temper-
ature acclimation. In the isopod Armadillidium Vulgare,
presumably a more terrestrial species, acclimation was demon-
strated in both metabolic rate and L.T. 50 (lethal temperature
at which 50% die) determinations. A good synopsis of the
literature may be found in Prosser (1961), as well as theories
concerning the biological bases for such physiological adapt-
ations.
In my brief study, no significant metabolic rate differ-
ences were obtained between P. Scaber populations kept at five
degrees C, Fifteen degrees C, and ambient air temperatures for
a period of two weeks. No significant differences were found
for L. T. 50 measurements either, but due to small sample sizes
and a stringent assumption of normality for the analysis used,
conclusions cannot be made with any certainty.
1. According to Edney (1964), Acclimation is defined as any
compensatory change in response to temperature resulting
fron events in an individual's lifetime.
