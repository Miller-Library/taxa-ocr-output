this cannot be substantiated due to possible non-normalities
present in the data.
Part III: Respiration Measurements
Respiration measurements were carried out using a Warburg
constant volume respirometer. Each run consisted of hourly
measurements of respiration for a six hour period, and a mean
hourly rate was calculated for each of ten animals. Regression
lines were fitted to the data and the results are shown in figs.
4,5, and 6. 910 values for each acclimation group were not
computed because the data indicated that this varied consider-
ably with the weight of the animal.
To compare the acclimation groups, a composite of figs. 4,
5, and 6 was made for a standard animal of 30 mg. weight. This
data is presented in fig. 7. Differences between the five
degree and fifteen degree groups were not significant, but
differences between the control group and the other two groups
were significant at the .05 level. This difference can be attrib-
uted to several confounding factors, none of which involve
acclimation. Firstly, mean environmental temperature of the
control group's habitat was 10.2 degrees centigrade, and an
elevation of this curve with respect to the 15 degree group is
to be expected. Secondly, behavioral differences exist which
were not controlled for between the control population and the
laboratory population.
