ABSTRACT
The effects of water height, temperature, and light intensity
on the movements of the marine annelid Cirriformia spirabrancha
were investigated. Of these three environmental factors, only
changes in water height elicited movement in C. spirabrancha
in that the worms only reacted to an absense of water on their
tentacles and body.
