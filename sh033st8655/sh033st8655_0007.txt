CCORDINATED FIELD OBSLNVAIIONS
Two field areas in the Monterey yaught harbor - one at the
plus 1.0 foot tidal level, the other at the minus 1.0 foot tidal
level - were observed at one hour intervals over several 24 hour
periods. The temperatures observed varied from 12° C to 22.5 C,
the water heights during these observations varied from two
meters above the sand to 4 cm below the sand surface, and the
light intensities immediately over the worms varied from less
than five foot candles to over 3,000 foot candles. The tentacle
number and length above the sand were recorded. The results
indicate that only the absense of water over the tentacles causes
them to be withdrawn into the sand, irregardless of the light
intensity and temperature.
DISCUSSION.
Some annelids, notably Hirudo and Glossiphonia, are attracted
by certain temperatures (Dales, 1963). Temperatures of 11.50
to 22° C, the temperatures found in the natural environment
from which my experimental worms were taken, do not effect
movement in the worm C. spirabrancha. Some isolated colonies
of worms may be subjected at times to temperatures greater than
22 ° C, but these temperature extremes were not tested.
Earthworms show a negative phototaxis when subjected to light
of high intensities, but negative phototaxis when subjected to
light of low intensities (Dales, 1963). Cirriformia spirabrancha
were tested in the laboratory at intensities from 25 foot
candles to 1,500 foot candles. An intensity of 25 foot candles
was used for the "night" studies, instead of O foot candles,
in order to facilitate observation without, introducing another
light at the time of observation. An intensity of 1,500 foot
