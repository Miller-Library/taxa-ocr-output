Norms were added to the large tank and allowed to burrow in
the same manner asin previous experiments. The temperature
was constantly maintained at 12.5 Â° C, and the light intensity
at an illumination of 750 foot candles. Although fresh sea
water was continually being pumped into the tank, the water
level was lowered at a rate of 8 cm per hour by means of a siphon
with a flow rate slightly faster than the rate of the inflowing
sea water. The water level was raised again by breaking the
siphon action and allowing the normal inflow to fill the tank.
The sea water was lowered from 30 cm above the sand to 10 cm
below the sand surface and then raised to 30 cm above the sand
again. The observations from ten such trials showed that while
the water level was lowered from 30 cm above the sand to 0.5 cm
above the sand, the tentacle number and length above the sand,
and the worm (body) depth in the substrate, remained unchanged.
As the water level dropped from 0.5 cm above the substrate to
the substrate surface, about half of the tentacles were with-
drawn from the surface and were seen to lay next to the body
of the worm. The other half of the tentacles decreased in length
above the sand and lay in the moisture of the thin water film
which had developed on the sand surface. When the water level
in the sand reached the head of the worm, the worm would contract
and move, tail first, down its mucus tube. It continued to
burrow downward, tail first, until it was immersed in the water
again. When the water level was again raised, the worms either
came up to theesurface again in their old mucus tubes, or
burrowed upward along a new path, forming new mucus tubes as
