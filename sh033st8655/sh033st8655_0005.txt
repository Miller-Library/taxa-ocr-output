temperature was again changed in a similar manner to 18 째 c,
and held for six hours. Finally the temperature was changed once
again in the same manner to 22 0.C and held there for a final
six hours. At one hour time intervals throughout the entire
experiment the number and length of tentacles, as well as the
body depth, were recorded. This experiment was repeated twice
using different groups of worms each time. No change in tentacle
number or length, or in body depth in the sand, was observed
with these changes in temperature. An additional series of
experiments were carried out in which the temperature in the tank
was first taken up - one degree per half hour - from 12.5 0 C
to 22 째 C, then lowered in the same fashion to 11.5째 C. Again,
after three trials, no change in tentacle number or length, or
body depth, occurred.

Worms were added to both tanks and alloved to burrow in the
same manner asiin the previous experiment. Throughout this
experiment, the temperature was maintained at 12.5째 C, and the
water height held at 10 cm above the sand in the small tank
and 30 cm above the sand in the large tank. The timer was wired
to the light source in order to automatically provide a con-
tinual day-night cycle (a 12 hour day of constant illumination
of 1,500 foot candles and a 12 hour "night" at a constant
intensity of under 25 foot candles). The worms were observed
every hour for two days. The tentacle number and length and
body depth were found not to change significantly under this
light regime. Following this experiment, one tank was kept
under a constant illumination of 1,500 foot candles, and the
other tank at an intensity of under 25 foot candles. Both tanks
were maintained for 24 hours, and observations made every hour.
