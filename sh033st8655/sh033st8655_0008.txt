candles was used for the day studies, as it was the maximum
intensity available under laboratory conditions. These intensities
effected no movement of g. spirabrancha. Field studies were
carried out to see if lower and higher intensities would effect
movement. These natural intensities, O foot candles to over
3,000 foot candles, did not seem to effect any movement.
Water height effected movement in C. spirabrancha in that
the worms only reacted to an absense of water on their tentacles
and body. The laboratory and field results seem to indicate
that the tentacle number and length above the sand, and the body
depth in the sand, remain constant if the water level is 0.5 cm
above the sand or higher.
