Initially both tanks were filled with running sea water main-
tained at 12.5° C. This temperature was maintained by the use
in each tank of a Heyco probe heater and a Chemical Rubber
Company thermometer, connected through a minitrol relay box
outside the tank. Each tank was equiped with an airator, which
was kept running at all times in order to assure adequate
oxygenation of the sea water. Both tanks were placed under a
variable light source capable of a maximum illumination, at the
waters surface, of 1,500 foot candles. Initially the light
intensity was maintained arbitrarily at a constant 750 foot
candles. During the experiment on varying light intensities,
a Holiday appliance timer was connected to the light source in
order to control automatically the hours of light and darkness.

In order to test the effects of temperature on the behavior
of C. spirabrancha, worms were added to the smaller tank and
allowed to burrow. During the four days in which the worms
were allowed to settle and burrow, the water in the tank was
maintained at 12.5° C. Throughout the experiment, the light
was kept at an intensity of 750 foot candles, and the water
height at a constant 10 cm above the sand surface. In a small
section of the tank where the worms could be observed, the number
of tentacles visible above the sand were counted and the lengths
of these tentacles recorded (lengths estimated at 0.5 cm, 1.0 cm,
or 1.5 cm). Likewise the body depth of each of the worms
visible against the glass was recorded. The temperature was
then changed - one degree per half hour - to 11.5° C, and held
at this temperature for six hours. After this period, the
