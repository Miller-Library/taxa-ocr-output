Irubcrin
Cirriformia spirabrancha is a marine annelid found in both
the intertidal and the subtidal sulfide rich mud of the Pacific
coast. Intertidal populations, at least, are subjected to
many environmental fluctuations, especially fluctuations in
water height, temperature, light intensity, surf action, and
oxygen tension. Many organisms exhibit cyclic behavioral pat-
terns which are in fact based upon some of these types of fluc-
tuations (Fingerman, 1960). However, nothing is really known
concerning the behavior of C. spirabrancha (MacGinitie, 1935),
or of other related species (George, 1964). Because of this
lack of knowledge on the behavior of cirratulids and the possi-
bility that some of this organism's behavior might be related to
the effects of water height, temperature, or light intensity,
a study of the effects of these parameters on the behavior of
C. spirabrancha was made. The results indicate that only one of
these three factors, water height, effects the behavior in this
species.
MAIERLALS AND METHODS
The experimental worms were obtained from the top 10 cm of mud,
at approximately the plus 1.0 foot tidal level, in the Monterey
yaught harbor. Two glass tanks (one 30 cm in width, 50 cm in
length, 40 cm in height; the other 30 cm in width, 70 cm in length,
60 cm in height) were used in the laboratory experiments. These
were set up in the following manner. Each tank was filled to a
height of 30 cm with sand from the worm's natural environment.
In each tank a glass plate was inserted in the sand along one
of the glass sides of the tank, about three fourths of a centi-
meter from this glass side, in order to facilitate observations
