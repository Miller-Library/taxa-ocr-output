Nacl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween, 0.02% (w/v) Thimerosal, 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk) for one hour,
then washed them twice with tris-buffered saline (TBS; 0.025M Tris-Cl pH7.5, O.15M NaCl). I
then incubated the membranes for one hour with a 1:2,500 solution of Buffer A (TBS, 2.5%
(w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (w/v) Thimerosal) and a monoclonal rat antibody (IgG)
against hsp70 (clone 7.10; affinity BioReagent MA3-001). I next washed the membranes for
five minutes with TBS, twice for five minutes each with TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween, then
a final five minutes with plain TBS. After that I incubated the membranes for 30 minutes with a
1:2000 solution of Buffer A and a rabbit-anti-rat bridging antibody (IgG; vector AI-4000),
followed by four washes as before (TBS/TBS-Tween/TBS-Tween/TBS). Finally, I incubated
the membranes for 30 minutes in a 1:5000 solution of Buffer A and horseradish-peroxidase
Protein A (BioRad), then washed the membranes for five minutes in TBS, three times for ten
minutes each in TBS with Tween, and, lastly, five more minutes with TBS.
These membranes were soaked in enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (ECL, Amersham)
for one minute and sealed in plastic wrap in an autoradiography cassette. I then exposed them, in
a darkroom, to pre-flashed hyperfilm (Amersham) for varying times (between 10 and 30
seconds) to obtain the most ideal exposures.
Results
As expected, the percentage of the Tegula population composed of large snails decreased
with intertidal height (Fig. 2). In the low zone, large animals composed up to 100 percent of the
population, while small snails composed almost 100 percent of the higher populations.
