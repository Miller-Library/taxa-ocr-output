Field Heating Experiment
The same gelatin-filled shells described above (minus one small shell that proved
unreliable in the above experiment) were attached to rocks in the intertidal zone: one small and
two large in the low intertidal (at the bottom of Tegula's range), and two each of large and small
in the high-mid intertidal (at the top of Tegula's range). The shells were secured to the rock by a
piece of fiberglass securing the thermistor cord and Z-spar securing the shell itself (Fig. 1). The
dataloggers were set to record the temperature every five minutes and the shells were left
attached for three weeks.
Heat Transfer Analysis
Tused the following equations to analyze the results of the heating experiments:
dU
Qs-Qe -Qe where
U= internal energy
Qs= solar energy gain
Oc = heat loss by convection to ambient air
OR = heat loss by radiation to adjacent bodies or to the sky
dU = me dT where
m = mass = Vp (volume times density) = 4/3 mo
c = specific heat
= Al where
a = absorptivity of snail surface to solar radiation
A = area exposed to sun. I approximated the snail as a sphere of radius r, so this would
be approximately ar
1 = Solar insolation
Qc - h.A.(T.-T,) where
h. = convective heat transfer coefficient
A. = effective area across which convective heat transfer occurs. Again I assumed a
sphere, so this would be the surface area, 4m
Ts = surface temperature of the snail
T= ambient air temperature
Tassumed radiant heat loss to be negligible.
