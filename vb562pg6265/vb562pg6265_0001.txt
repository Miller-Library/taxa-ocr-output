Abstract
Tegula funebralis, the black turban snail, is an intertidal gastropod with a distinctive intertidal
size gradient; large snails tend to live in the lower portion of the snail's range and small snails in
the upper portion. Many factors have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, including
differential larval settlement, juvenile mortality, response to light, and, most commonly,
predation pressure. I investigated the potential contribution of thermal stress on the size gradient
in a study area that has been shown to have very little predation on Tegula. I performed two
types of experiments: temperature measurements of gelatin-filled snails and heat shock protein
analysis of gill tissue from large and small snails that had been caged in the intertidal. Although
my heat shock analysis was inconclusive, temperatures were consistently lower in small snails
than in large snails, both in a controlled environment and in the field, a disparity possibly caused
by differences in the absorptivity of large and small snail shells. Heat shock protein analysis
could verify that larger snails experience this increased heat stress. Finally, a vertical size
gradient also appears to occur between different intertidal gastropod species, another indication
that size-dependent thermal stress could be important in determining intertidal gastropod
zonation.
