This is the case at HMS, where there is a size gradient but little predation of any sort on
Tegula (Rocca 1995). After verifying that the size gradient existed in my experimental area, I
investigated the importance of thermal stress on its formation. First, I measured the temperatures
of gelatin-filled snail shells over a short time course in a dry environment and over a long time
course in the field at high and low intertidal sites. In addition to these temperature-monitoring
experiments, lattempted to quantify the levels of heat stress experienced by large and small
snails by measuring their levels of heat shock proteins (hsps).
Hsps are induced during the heat shock response, which occurs in almost all cells (Parsell
and Lindquist 1993). Hsps are molecular chaperones that help renature denatured proteins,
reduce their aggregation, and dispose of irreversibly denatured proteins. The synthesis of hsps is
thought to be proportional to the amount of stress the cell experiences (DiDomenico et. al. 1982).
Unfortunately, the hsp quantification experiments did not produce any conclusive results.
However, I found that, under equal conditions, large snails consistently reach higher
temperatures than small snails. Because earlier work indicates that small temperature increases
such as the ones I found can have negative physiological consequences, heat stress could be an
important factor in establishing the vertical size gradient of Tegula funebralis.
Materials and Methods
Definition of "large," "medium," and 'small
For all but the size distribution experiment, large snails are those between 17 mm
maximum basal diameter (mbd) and 22 mm mbd, and small snails are those between 7 mm mbd
and 12 mm mbd. In the size distribution study large snails were 17 or more mm mbd, medium
snails were between 12.1 and 16.9 mm mbd, and small snails were 12 or less mm mbd.
