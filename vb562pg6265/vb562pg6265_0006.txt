Field Setup for Heat Shock Experiment
Adjacent to the dataloggers, 1 attached four wire mesh cages: one cage each for large and
small snails in both the high and low intertidal areas. Twenty snails that had been acclimating in
13°C seawater for one week were put in each cage. I attached the cages four days before the
beginning of a nine-day low tide cycle (Day 0). I took a five-snail sample from each cage on
days 6, 8, and 12 of the experiment. These snails were placed immediately on dry ice and kept
frozen until dissection.
Heat Shock Analysis
Ifirst dissected the gill tissue of the snails under non-heat-shock producing conditions (in
ice-cold sea water). I immediately added 80 uL of homogenization buffer (32 mmol/L Tris-Cl
pH 7.5 at 4°C, 2% (w/v) SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L Pefabloc, 10 ug/mL pepstatin,
lOug/mL leupeptin) to small snail gill tissue and 200 uL to large snail tissue, then boiled the
mixture for five minutes. Next, I homogenized the tissue with a silicone pestle and boiled the
homogenate again for five minutes. Finally, I centrifuged the homogenate at 15,800 g for 15
minutes and removed the supernatant, discarding the tissue pellet. I determined the protein
concentration of each sample using the Pierce Micro BCA assay according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
separated the protein samples by SDS-PAGE (200V for approximately 45 minutes; 5 ug
of protein in each lane) on a BioRad mini-gel. Then I transferred the protein to a nitrocellulose
membrane (1 hour 15 minutes at 80 mA) and let the membranes dry overnight.
1 put each membrane in its own 45 mL tube and incubated the tubes with constant
agitation. First, I blocked the membranes with blocking buffer (0.025M Tris-Cl pH 7.5, O.15M
