Given that he, 1 and 74 are equal, and that the snails start out with equivalent surface
temperatures (Ts), the only possible explanation for the observed temperature difference is that
large snail shells have a higher absorptivity than small ones. Since absorptivity is closely related
to color, this indicates that the ratio of black shell to white shell for large snails may be greater
than for small snails. Simple field measurements should be done to determine if this hypothesis
is true.
Given two to five degree C warmer body temperatures for large snails and the equivalent
heat tolerance of snails of different sizes, living higher in the intertidal would be more difficult
for large snails over time. Tomanek and Somero (1999) found that at 36 degrees—a temperature
often reached by the large gelatin-filled snails but never by the small ones—Tegula funebralis
gill tissue stopped producing any non-hsp protein, a sign of extreme heat stress. An analysis,
like the one 1 attempted, of heat shock proteins in both large and small snails kept under
equivalent environmental conditions would verify whether living large snails are truly under
greater heat stress, and the magnitude of the stress if it exists.
The advantage of small size appears not to be restricted simply to the species Tegula
funebralis. There also seems to be an interspecies intertidal size gradient that warrants further
investigation. For example, the subtidal species Tegula brunnea is generally larger than the mid¬
intertidal Tegula funebralis, while the high-intertidal species of genus Littorina are generally
smaller than both species of Tegula (Shannon Taylor, unpublished observations). This gradient
may not be due entirely to temperature (for instance, small snails may be better able to exploit
