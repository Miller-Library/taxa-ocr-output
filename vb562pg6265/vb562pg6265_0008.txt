The lethal temperature experiment revealed that there is no difference between the
temperature of heat death in large and small snails; all snails died during the interval between 43
and 44 degrees Celsius.
During the lab heating rate experiment, one datalogger was eliminated from the analysis
and from the field due to extremely anomalous results. The other seven dataloggers showed that
although small snails heat up more quickly at first, large snails reach higher temperatures (Fig.
3). This same result was seen for snails in the low intertidal, although only two dataloggers
survived the three weeks intact (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, no dataloggers from the large snails and
only one datalogger from the small snails returned usable data in the high intertidal, preventing
further analysis.
Only one run of the heat shock analysis was successful, so the data were insufficient for
analysis.
Discussion
Although the faster heating and cooling rates of smaller snails were expected, given that
they have a higher ratio of surface area to volume, the consistently higher temperatures of larger
snails are more difficult to explain. Using the heat transfer equations given in the Materials and
Methods, the ratio of the heating rate of a small snail to a large snail with twice the radius (e.g., a
small snail with radius 5 mm and a large snail with radius 10 mm) is:

which simplifies to:
