macroalgae and rocks for protection for the sun and predators (Garrity 1984)), but heat stress is
likely to be involved.
Conclusion
Although the intertidal size gradient of Tegula funebralis is multifactorial, heat stress seems to
play an important role in maintaining the upper limits. Because something— possibly their
lowered absorptivity— helps small snails avoid the high temperatures of large snails, the small
snails live in a less stressful microenvironment than their large counterparts and, therefore, are
likely to have a higher chance of survival. This small-size advantage may also be an interspecies
phenomenon

I would like to thank my advisors, Prof. George Somero and Dr. Lars Tomanek, for helping me
conceive and run my experiments. I would also like to thank my father, Steve Taylor, for
helping me to understand heat transfer physics.
