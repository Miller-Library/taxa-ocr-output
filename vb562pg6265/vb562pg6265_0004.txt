Size Distribution
Sampling was conducted using a 0.25 m* quadrat and a measuring tape. I lay my transects
perpendicular to the shoreline and measured all the snails that fell within the quadrat at each
meter mark. Ithen used a surveyor’s level and stadia rod to determine the height of each of my
measurement areas.
Lethal Temperature
Snails were placed in a water bath at 13°C and heated at approximately 0.4°C per minute.
At regular time intervals, ten individuals of both large and small snails were removed and tested
for withdrawal response to tactile foot stimulation.
Controlled Heating Experiment
Tremoved four large and four small snails from their shells, then filled the shells with
gelatin, inserted a thermistor, and sealed the shell with silicone to prevent evaporation of the
water in the gelatin. The thermistor was attached to a Stow Away brand datalogger, which was
set to record the snail’s temperature every 5 seconds. The datalogger was enclosed in an Icalite
brand waterproof case in preparation for the field experiment described below.
All eight snails with dataloggers attached were placed on a cement surface in direct
sunlight on a clear day. I oriented all the shells in the same direction relative to the sun. The
snails were left undisturbed, but under constant observation, for one hour.
