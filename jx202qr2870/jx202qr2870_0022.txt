List of common organisms on
Area 6
Physical Description of Area
The area consists of 3 distinct sections-
(a) a flat shelf above the cliff of a-
area 1, receiving only heavy splash at
high tide; (b) a gently sloping rock
channel back of area 5, most of which
is awash only at high high tides. Con-
tains one large, landlocked tidepool;
(c) a very irregular rocky shelf re-
ceiving heavy surf, offering however
many different degrees of protection
from wave shock. Contains several
large tidepools. Water washing in as
tide begins to rise is brown and murky.

General Remarks
Although this area is not as obvi-
ously "sick" as those closer to
the outfall, containing very many
of the most common species, it
could not be called unpolluted.
Some very familiar forms are
scarce or missing (such as the Ca-
lifornia mussel and the red alga
Endocladia), while others are
far more abundant here than might
be expected. (Examples being the
goose barnacle and the chiton Nut-
t√§llina.). As in other areas, middle
zone algae are scarce and tend to as-
sume highly atypical forms.
