Intertidal zonation (approximate), taken from Ricketts and Calvin,
as follows
zone 1 - at or just above level of highes
high tides.
zone 2 - region between lower high water an
mean higher low water.
zone 3 - region between mean higher low wa
and meen lower low water.
zone 4.- region between mean lower low water
and lowest low tides.

es and Distributions of
Intert
Algae:
Enteromorpha intestinalis (green alga) - abundant just abe
tide mark on cliff just back of outfall.
Gigartina sp. (red alga) - forming a dense, stubby growth (less th
1" high) on some protected surfaces at upper and middle levels.
algal slime (during study period, mostly colonial diatoms, esp.
Acnanthes. ; some blue-green algae, bits of EnteroÂ¬
morpna.) - on all rock surfaces from about mean high tide mark
through middle zones.
Prionitis lanceolata (red alga) - stubby clumps (less than 2"
on rocks at lower levels.
Animals:
Acmaea digitalis (limpet) - small ones (under 2") near high t
mark on clilf. One 12" x 3' band had 13.
Balanus glandula (acorn barnacle)- patchy on cliff at all levels,
typical density about 100/ft.2; scattered individuals on boulders
Tetraclita sp. (red barnacle) - scattered individuals lower dowr
on clifi.
Pollicipes polymerus (goose barnacle) - occasional 2-3" clumps
of small ones (under ?") in cracks on cliff.
Tethymia aptena (larva; a'fly) - in slime on rocks of upper
and mid levels, esp. on cliff just back of pipe; one count
showed about 200 in a square foot.
yanoplax hartwegii (chiton) - numerous in cracks at all level
on aliff. One 4 ft. vertical crevice had 9.
