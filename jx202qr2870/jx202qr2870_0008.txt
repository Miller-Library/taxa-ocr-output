Coliform bacteria counts
Coliform bacteria, which occur in the human intestine, are widely use
as an indicator of sewage pollution; where they are encountered there is alsc
the possibility of disease organisms being present.
Counts were taken on two dates during the study period, following the
procedure in Standard Methods of Waste and Water Analysis. Three primary
fermentation tubes at each of three dilutions were used, and a cowfirmed tes
as made using eosin methylene blue agar. The results are presented in fig-
ure 4. In general, these correspond well to the current and dilution patterns
discussed above, with the exception that an occasional high court may be found
at some distance away (see samples 3 and 11 in figure 4.). As these were al-
ways in shallow, protected areas, it would seem that bacteria (not necessaril.
from the effluent) sometimes happen into a pocket providing especially favorable
growth conditions, giving counts that do not reflect the actual level of ef-
fluent dilution (but perhaps significant frow the standpoint of public health).
Dissolved oxyger
Wicro-organisms tend to attack and break down at a high rate the ergan
tter discharged in sewage, using up in the process large quantities of
ogygen, which is vital to larger plants and animals. Thus, oxygen depletior
can be a mearure of sewage pollution.
Dissolved oxygen determinations were done concurrently with the coli-
form counts, using the standard Winkler titration method. The results are
