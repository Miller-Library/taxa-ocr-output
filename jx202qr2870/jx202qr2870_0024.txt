Names and Distributions of Conspicuous Intertidal Organisms
Corallina sp. (coralline alga) - very common on rocks at lower
middle and lowest levels.
Prionitis lanceolata (red alga) - occasional plants in lowest zone;
common in tidepools flushed at high tide.
Laminaria sp. ( brown alga) - abundant in lowest zone.
Bossea sp. (coralline alga) - covering rocks from lowest intertida
level down into subtidal.
Animals:
Chthamalus sp. (small brown barnacle) - dominant barnacle of upper
levels, often completely covering rock surfaces.
Balanus glandula (acorn barnacle) - common just below Chthamalus;
never dense.
Tegula (turban snail) - extremely numerous in channel containing
pipe.
Acmaea digitalis & scabra (limpets) - common higher up.
ganoplax hartwegii (chiton) - occasional in cracks at upper mid level.
Nuttallina (chiton) - numerous on shady surfeces of middle zone, as
many as 15-18 per square meter.
Tetraclita (red barnacle) - abundant on more protected surfaces of
middle zone, often forming dense coverings.
Pollicipes (goose barnacle) - very dense populations covering most
rather exposed rock surfaces of middle zone. Nost individuals smal
(under 1").
tilus californianus (mussel) - infrequent small individuals (under
4 ") in some Pollicipes clumps.
Lottia gigantea (owl limpet) - occasional individuals in cracks at
all levels above lowest.
Acmaea, mostly A. limatula (limpets. Common in tidepools, esp. in
large landlacked tidepool, where one count showed 11 in a suare foot.
Anthopleura xanthogrammica (giant anemone) - common in pool and in
mid and lower zone crevices.
Haliotis cracherodii (black abalone) - occasional individuals in
crevices lower down.
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin)- very numerous
in one large tidepool.
Katherina tunicata (large black chiton)- 1-2/ meter2 in lowest zone.
