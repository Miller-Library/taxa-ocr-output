ames and Distributions of Gonspicuous Intertidal Organisms
Tegula (turban snail) - numerous in one protected rock pool.
Pollicipes (goose barnacle) - scattered small clumps of small ones
near top of slope; some large rocks at south edge of area have dens
populations.
Tethymia aptena (fly;larva) - very numerous in slime on top half c
slope.
Cyanoplax hartwegii (chiton) - common in cracks at upper mid level
Nuttallina (chiton) - about one/ square meter, occurring below
yanoplax.
Mopalia muscosa (chiton) - almost one to a rock at lower levels.
Anthopleura xanthogrammica (giant anemone) - occasional ones betwee
rocks in rowest zone.

s and Distributions of Conspicuous Intertidal Org√•nisms
Algae:
Enteromorpha intestinalis (green alga) - common on rock shelf over-
looking outfall.
Rhodoglossum sp. (red alga) - frequent patches at upper levels.
Gigartina sp. (red alga) - frequent clumps at upper levels; also forms
a stubby covering on some rocks lower down.
Iridea sp. (red alga) - scattered small plants (2-3 ") at upper
mid level, especially in shaded cracks.
Lithophyllum grumosum (encrusting coralline alga) - frequent arg
patches on shaded surfaces of middle zone.
algal slime (as in area 1) - on some rocks in places flooded but
not rapidly flushed at high tide. Obvious but not measureably thick
on rocks in large landlocked tidepool.
Heterochordaria abietina (brown alga) - often forming dense beds on
relatively exposed middle level rock surfaces.
Egregia (strap alga) - occasional plants in tidepools, at lower
middle level.
