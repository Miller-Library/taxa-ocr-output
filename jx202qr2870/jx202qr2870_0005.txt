Thosphate, a basic raw material needed by plants for the synthesis of
certain organic compounds, is often found in high concentrations in sewage;
the phosphate level in Pacific Grove's effluent is roughly 100 times that of
the receiving seawter. Nowever, because this ion is not ordinarily a limi-
ing growth factor in the ocean, this large excess does not tend to be ta-
gen up by living organisms. These facts, combined with the sensitivity of
the method of detection, make phosphate concentration a reasonable mea-
sure of effluent dilution.
Determinations were made of the phosphate content of the
ying distances from the outfall, using the method described by Stricklan
and Parsons. The results are shown in figure 3. The pattern apparent i-
generally that which might be predicted from the current studies discussed
above when these are combined with a knowledge of tide and effluent flow co
ditions at the time of sampling. The highest concentrations are found in
those areas where water carrying effluent tends to sit. To the west and
along the north side of the point (except when there is flow across chan-
