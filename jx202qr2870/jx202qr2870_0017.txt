Names and Distributions of Conspicuous Intertidal Organisms.
Algae:
algal slime (as in area1) - on all rocks from lower middl
zone up to about level of lowest hich water.
Gigartina sp.
Rhodoglossum sp. (red algae) - forming dense, stubby (about +
high) patches on backs of many rocks of upper and middle levels.

Iridea sp.(red alga) - 5 or 6 small (blades less than 14") plants
on packs of many rocks in middle zones. Sometimes forms stubby
(about 1" patches 3-4" in diameter.
Heterochordaria abietina ( brown alga) - occasional 1-14" patche
on rocks about lower middle level.
Corallina sp. (coralline alga) - occasional small patches on rock
of lower levels.
Prionitis lanceolata (red alga) - covers most rocks at lowest level;
also in pools through middle zones. Takes many widely varied forms.
Gigartina spinosa (red alga) - occasional plants, occurring with Prio-
nitis.
Animals:
Balanus glandula (acorn barnacle) - on tops and sides of rocks at
all levels, esp. higher up. Densities as bigh as + 1000/ft.
Cirolana hartfordi (pill bug) - numerous under rocks at upper and
middle levels. One rock 8" in diameter sheltered about 50.
Tetraclita (red barnacle) - common in middle and lower zones, often
completely covering well-protected surfaces.
Tethymia (fly larva) - in slime and algae holdfasts in middle zone.
Cyanoplax hartwegii (chiton) - one or two in almost every depres-
sion in rocks of middle zones.
ttallina californica (chiton) - occasional individuals on rocks
at lower middle level.
Mopalia muscosa (chiton) - common on low rocks throughout lower and
middle zones, or 2 per meter2 of ground area.
Tegula sp.(turban snail) - scattered throughout area in protec-
ted spots; 3-4rock in lowest zone; numerous above slime in large tidepool
Dodecaceria sp. (tube worm) - dense masses of tubes on many rocks
of lowest zone.
Anthopleura xanthogrammica (giant green anemone) - common between
rocks at lower edge of lowest zone; about 10 in large tidepool bac
of area 1.
