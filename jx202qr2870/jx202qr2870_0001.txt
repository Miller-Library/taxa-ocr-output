A Survey of the Effects of the Pacific Grove Semage Outfall
on the Surrounding Intertidal Region.

I. Introduction
Pacific Grove, California, discharges its sewage after primary
treatment from an oceen outfall,located on a narrow spit within the
boundaries of the Point Pinos Lighthouse Reservation, a marine life
preserve. The end of the pipe is about 500 feet from the base of the
point and lies two feet below mean sea level in a rocky intertidal area,
fifteen feet from shore. (see fig. 1). The region receives heavy surf.
The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of
this outfall on the adjacent shore areas as measured by the distribu-
tions, with respect to the point of discharge, of common intertidal
organisms, and to relate these results to local currents and to other
parameters of pollution, including plots of phosphate concentration,
dissolved oxygen levels, and coliform bacteria counts.
According to a study done for the Gity Council by Engineering Sei-
ence, Inc., flow volume of this waste, which is almost wholly of domes-
tic origin, averages about 1.8 million gallons per day (mgd) during dry
weather, and about 4.5 mgd during periods of prolonged rainfall. During
heavy winter storms, because of seepage into the pipe system, flow may
