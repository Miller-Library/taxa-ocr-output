channels appear considerably more voltage-dependent than those of both Loligo and
Aplysia. Fitting single exponentials to the inactivation-voltage relationships for all three
organisms yields KÂ» values of 0.054, 0.116, and 0.015 for Aplysia, Strombus, and Loligo,
respectively.
Recovery from inactivation
Comparative data for recovery from inactivation of sodium channels for
cephalopods and gastropods were unavailable for analysis. Across most studied
organisms, however, the relationship between the interval between the conditioning and
test pulse and relative recovery of Iva is approximately described by an exponential curve
Furthermore, recovery from inactivation is highly dependent on the voltage between test
pulses and is increasingly rapid at more negative voltage levels (Hille 1992).
Strombus pedal ganglia sodium channels clearly exhibit both recovery trends.
Recovery is quite rapid at very negative interpulse voltages and less rapid at more
positive voltages, as shown in Figure 5A. The relationship between Strombus recovery
time constants and voltage is given in Figure 5B. Note that even at an interpulse voltage
of -60 mV, Strombus sodium channels fully recover by 10 ms, a value consistent with a
maximum motor nerve firing rate of 100 Hz.
Toxin sensitivity
As shown in Figure 6A, Strombus pedal ganglia sodium channels are resistant to
tetrodotoxin (TTX), a trait they share with many other gastropods (Adams et al. 1980). In
contrast, cephalopod sodium channels, like those most other organisms, are highly
sensitive to TTX and would be completely blocked at the concentration used. Strombus
sodium channels also display little sensitivity to Conus californicus milked venom
