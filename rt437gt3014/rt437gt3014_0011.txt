Acknowledgments
This project could not have been completed without the invaluable help and guidance of
my advisor, William Gilly. Thank you also to Rob DeConde for his commitment to
acquiring excellent cells. Td also like to thank all of the members of the Gilly lab who
provided patience answers to my many questions.
