Introduction
The gastropod mollusk Strombus luhuanus exhibits a dramatic backward jumping
escape response in the presence of molluscivorous cone snails. During an escape
sequence, à Strombus thrusts its serrated operculum forward and into the substratum, lifts
it shell off the ground, extends its muscular foot, and lands with its shell up to 5
centimeters backward from where it started (Berg 1974). Analysis of footage of the
Strombus escape response reveals that a typical jump lasts approximately a second, from
the moment the snail first lifts its shell from the substrate to the time it lands.
Strombus' ability to rapidly initiate this escape sequence, combined with the
considerable muscular control it exhibits during a single jump, suggests that the Strombus
neuromuscular system may be capable of high-frequency activity. One means of
examining the speed at which neurons can transmit information is to investigate the
kinetic characteristics of voltage-gated ion channels responsible for the propagation of
action potentials, particularly Na- channels. Kinetic properties of Strombus Na- channels
are interesting not only in their own right, but also in comparison to those of other
mollusks. Notably, cephalopod sodium channels possess fast activation and inactivation
kinetics over a broad range of voltages, but kinetics of gastropod Na- channels, in
contrast, are much more voltage-dependent (Gilly et al. 1997). Thus, gastropod Na¬
channels are slower at middle voltages (-20-0 mV) than they are at very positive voltages.
It has been suggested that the fast Na- channel kinetics at mid-range voltages near action
potential threshold, such as those in cephalopods, expedite rapid signaling crucial for
control of fast swimming behavior or escape. Given Strombus' rapid escape response, it
