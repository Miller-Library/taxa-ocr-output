judged by the eye. Characteristics of recovery from inactivation were ascertained by
varying the duration and voltage levels between two test voltage pulses of identical
amplitude.
Results
Maximum firing frequency of the motor nerve is - 100 Hz
The small size of the Strombus motor nerve prevents easy measurement of action
potentials. Maximum firing frequency can be ascertained indirectly, however, by
examining the relationship between frequency of motor nerve stimulation and the graded
rate of force development by muscles of the foot. Application of a short train (-1 s) of
stimulus at various frequencies revealed that the muscle response approached a maximum
around à frequency of 100 Hz (Figure 1A). Application of two pulses at various intervals
indicated that summation of twitch response did not reliably occur with an interpulse
interval of less than about 10 ms (Figure 1B). Thus, both of these experiments indicate
that the motor nerve can fire at a maximum frequency of about 100 Hz.
Features of Strombus Na- Currents
Current-voltage and conductance-voltage relationships
Na“ channels of Strombus pedal ganglia cells display typical current-voltage and
conductance-voltage relationships (Figure 2). Strombus G-V relationships are similar to
those of both cephalopods and gastropods described by Gilly et al. (1997). Like
Strombus, Loligo and Aplysia Nat channels, achieve peak conductance around 20 mV
and about 2/3 peak conductance at 0 mV.
