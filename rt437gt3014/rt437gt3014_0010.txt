Conclusion
This preliminary analysis of Strombus sodium channels suggests that voltage-dependent
features of activation and inactivation differ from those of both cephalopods and other
gastropods. Further confirmation of the apparent lack of coupling between activation and
inactivation in Strombus are warranted, and should be achieved ideally by fitting
exponentials to prepulse-subtracted traces. If the observed trends are replicated,
Strombus sodium channels deserve much closer biophysical analysis.
