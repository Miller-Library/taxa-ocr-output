Figure 1
A: Relationship between frequency of stimulus applied to the Strombus motor nerve and
the maximum rate of force development in the foot.
B: Relationship between the duration between twin stimuli to the Strombus motor nerve
and the amplitude of force exerted by the foot.
Figure 2
A: Instantaneous I-V curve for sodium current in Strombus pedal ganglia cells.
B: Conductance-voltage relationship for Strombus pedal ganglia cells, determined from
the equation G-(Vmembrane-Vreversal). The reversal potential was -85 mV, determined by
extrapolating the IV curve in A to where it intersects the x-axis.
Figure 3
A: Voltage-dependence of activation time constants in Strombus pedal cells, Loligo giant
fiber cells, and Aplysia pedal cells.
B: Voltage-dependence of half-times-to-peak in Strombus, Loligo, and Aplysia.
Figure 4
Voltage-dependence of inactivation time constants in Strombus, Loligo, and Aplysia.
