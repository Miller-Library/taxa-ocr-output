is interesting to ask if they possess "slow" or "fast" Nat channels at the mid range of
voltages.
This paper describes the results of experiments investigating both Strombus'
ability to transmit high frequency motor information as well kinetic parameters of sodium
channels recorded from Strombus pedal ganglia neurons. This paper integrates data on
Strombus sodium channels with similar data on Loligo and Aplysia taken from Gilly et al.
(1997). While Strombus sodium currents appear cephalopod-like in their relative
voltage-independence of activation rates, inactivation rates in Strombus are more voltageÂ¬
dependent and thus more similar to typical gastropods.
Materials and Methods
Force Measurements
A strain gauge was used to measure the force exerted by the foot due to electrical
stimulation of the motor nerve. Two procedures were used to determine the maximum
stimulus frequency that the motor nerve could follow. The first involved varying the time
between twin pulses of stimuli and determining the shortest interval which gave
summation of the twitch amplitude. The second involved applying a stimulus of a given
frequency for - 1 s and monitoring the rate of force development. Similar experiments
were conducted on two snails.
Cell Preparation and Culture
The pedal ganglia was identified and extracted from a dissected snail. The sheath was
removed after soaking the ganglia for 45 minutes at room temperature in a 7 mg/mL
solution of commercially-available protease IVX (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in sea
water. Cells from the ganglia were then manually dissociated onto Con A-coated
