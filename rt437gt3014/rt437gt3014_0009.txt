dependence demonstrated highly voltage-dependent inactivation time constants. Similar
trends were evident in multiple Strombus pedal cells. Given that activation and
inactivation gating is thought to be coupled in many organisms, including squid and
mammals, the trends observed in Strombus are somewhat surprising. It is possible that
Strombus Na+ channels are true deviants, activating in a voltage-independent fashion, but
inactivating in a voltage-dependent fashion.
Strombus Kinetic parameters described in this paper may be confounded by the
fact that exponentials were fit to currents that contained both inactivating and non¬
inactivating components. In their comparative analysis of gastropod and mollusk Na¬
channels, Gilly et al. fit exponentials only to the inactivating current component, isolated
by a prepulse subtraction method (see paper for details). Similar methods were not
employed in the study of Strombus Na+ currents, however, because isolated fast-
inactivating traces are much noisier than non-subtracted traces, preventing reliable fitting
of kinetic parameters. While the non-inactivating current seen in Strombus pedal cells
was generally quite small (on the order of -200 pA at 0 mV), it is possible that failing to
subtract this current component distorted the estimations of activation and inactivation
time constants.
Despite an indication that Strombus sodium channels resemble cephalopod
channels in their voltage-dependence of activation, the data on toxin effects suggests a
fundamental dissimilarity in structure. Even if Strombus has evolved sodium channels
that open quickly at middle voltage levels-an adaptation which would enable their rapid
escape-it seems quite reasonable that structural features of gastropod channels
independent of activation and inactivation gating have been preserved.
