Discussion
Results described in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that Strombus
motor neurons can transmit high frequency information in order to control their rapid
escape response. Less clear, however, is the extent to which biophysical properties of
Strombus sodium channels deviate from those of the typical gastropod and resemble those
of the typical cephalopod.
Although the voltage-dependence of activation time constants is similar in
Strombus and Loligo, Loligo channels are considerably faster at all voltages.
Furthermore, recordings from Loligo giant fiber lobe cells were taken at 10 degrees,
whereas recordings from Strombus pedal cells were taken at 22.5 degrees. Because
channel kinetics generally become more rapid as the temperature increases, the relative
slowness of Strombus sodium channels might be taken as an argument against their truly
being "cephalopod like." However, activation time constants in Strombus may be
comparable to those of cephalopods when recordings are made at temperatures more
representative of their natural tropical environment (i.e. -30 degrees). Further
experiments at ecologically relevant temperatures are necessary to confirm this
hypothesis. Ultimately, because the absolute speed of channel kinetics is so dependent on
temperature, what is most relevant is that Strombus sodium channels display cephalopodÂ¬
like voltage-activation trends.
Inactivation-voltage relationships in Strombus are even more difficult to interpret.
The same cell whose activation time constants displayed relatively little voltage-
