Abstract
This paper examines kinetic properties of Na- channels in Strombus luhanus, a gastropod
notable for its rapid backward jumping escape response. Previous comparative studies on
cephalopod and gastropod Na- channels indicate that taxonomic differences exist in the
voltage-dependencies of activation and inactivation: cephalopod channels are fast across
a broad range of voltages, whereas gastropod channels are much slower at negative
voltages than they are at very positive voltages. The voltage-independence of cephalopod
Na+ channel kinetics is hypothesized to be important in mediating fast escape and
swimming behavior. Analysis of kinetic parameters of Strombus sodium currents was
performed in order to ascertain whether the voltage-dependence of their activation and
inactivation rates deviate from those of slower gastropods and resemble those of
cephalopods. It was found that as in cephalopods, activation rates in Strombus NaÂ¬
channels display little voltage-dependence. Similar to other gastropods, however,
inactivation rates in Strombus Na+ channels are quite voltage-dependent.
