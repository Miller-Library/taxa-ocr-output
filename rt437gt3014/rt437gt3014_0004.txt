Recording from Pedal Cells
With the use of a List EPC-7 amplifier, conventional whole-cell patch-clamp
methods were employed to record Na+ current from pedal neurons. Electrodes made of
7052 glass were pulled and fire-polished so that their resistance in the bath was -0.8-2
M82. Uncompensated input resistance values were typically less than 1 MQ. Series
resistance and capacitance compensation were adjusted frequently throughout the course
of an experiment by examining the capacitance current transient resulting from an 11 mV
test pulse. All recordings were filtered at 5-10 kHz. Linear ionic and capacity currents
were removed on-line with a standard P/-4 procedure.
External bath recording solutions contained (in mM) 480 Na, 20 MgCl» 10 CaCl»,
and 20 MgSO, at pH 8.0. Internal pipette recording solutions contained (in mM) 20 tetra
methyl ammonium (TMA)-Cl, 80 TMA-glutamate, 50 TMA-F, 10 lysine, 1 EGTA, 1
EDTA, 381 glycine, 291 sucrose, 10 Hepes at pH 7.8 . All recordings analyzed in this
study were taken at 22.5 %
Determination of Kinetic Parameters
Both activation and inactivation parameters were determined by fitting single
exponentials to current traces in response to 6 or 12 ms voltage steps, sampled at rates of
10 us and 20 us, respectively. Activation time constants were determined by fitting
exponentials to the final rise of lya; i.e., from 3/4 peak amplitude to peak amplitude.
Inactivation time constants were determined by fitting lya from the peak to the end of the
pulse. Exponentials were not fitted to traces where noise prevented a reasonable fit, as
