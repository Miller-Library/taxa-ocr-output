Activation
Activation time constants for sodium currents in Strombus pedal cells are much less
voltage-dependent than those of slower-moving gastropods, such as Aplysia, as shown in
Figure 3A. Furthermore, although Strombus sodium channels activate more slowly
than cephalopod channels at all voltages, they display similar exponential voltage
dependencies. These distinctions are apparent when one fits single exponential curves of
the form Ko + Kjexp(-Kzx) to the Tauon-voltage relationships for Loligo, Strombus, and
Aplysia.. Ka values for Loligo, Strombus, and Aplysia sodium channels are .033,.02, and
07 respectively
In addition to activation time constants, the time required for the current to reach
half its peak value provides a measure of how quickly channels open. As shown in
Figure 3B, Strombus sodium channels have slightly longer half-times-to-peak than
Loligo sodium channels, but shorter half-times-to-peak than Aplysia sodium channels.
These results are consistent with the activation time constant trends in the three
organisms; Strombus half-times-to-peak are intermediate between those of Loligo and
Aplysia. Unlike the time constant data, however, exponential decay rates for the half-time
versus voltage relationships are similar across the genera studied. KÂ» values are .038,
.031, and .036 for Aplysia, Strombus, and Loligo, respectively.
Inactivation
Unlike time constants of activation, the kinetic parameters of inactivation of sodium
currents in Strombus pedal ganglia cells display marked voltage-dependence. Strombus
cells exhibit fast inactivation rates at high voltages, but much slower inactivation rates at
lower voltages (Figure 4). Indeed, inactivation time constants for Strombus sodium
