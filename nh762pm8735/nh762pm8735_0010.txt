transitions are relatively simple.
Spontaneous behavior of Melibe leonina is an observable and analyzable
subject of study. The information that the study has provided shows that
behavior does not have to be elicited in order to be interesting. Possibilities
for future research include examining learning in Melibe determining the
physiological changes of the animal between behavioral loops and determining
the usefulness of the predictive capability of the one-step transition model
for whole animal electrophysiological preparations.
