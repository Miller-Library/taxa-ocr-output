RESULTS:
Initial observation of Melibe led to the distinction between nine
different behaviors, six of which are common, and three which are less
common in spontaneous behavior (figure 4). Copulation was observed to occur
during day and night hours, and all other behaviors, other than swimming,
were observed to occur spontaneously with copulation, as opposed to
observations made by Ageska (1972) which claimed that animals must remain
quiescent during copulation.
Analysis began with the study of casting/feeding behavior. Total time
spent in each behavior was tabulated for every animal. Plots were made of
total time spent in a behavior versus the volume of the animal (figure 5).
Feeding behavior was well correlated with size, with larger animals spending
more time feeding. Time spent resting showed a tendency to decrease as size
increased, but the correlation coefficient was low.
Transitional frequencies between consecutive behaviors were calculated
(figure 7). Using these frequencies, I diagramed all transitions with a
frequency greater than ten percent (figure 8). This diagram shows graphically
a tendency of the Melibe to remain in one of two behavior loops, F-OH-R/OH
or RST-AL-R/AL. The statistical reality of these loops was quantified and it
was found that transitions between these loops were significantly lower than
between any other combination of 3 or 4 behaviors.
Total time spent in each loop for every animal was counted, as
well as the average number of intervals within each loop. Volume of animals
was graphed against time spent in the F-Ã–H-R/OH loop (figure 9). Larger
animals tend to spend more time in this feeding loop.
Four behaviors, F, OH, RST, and AL had a tendency to last longer than just
one interval before transition. I defined a session as a period in which a
single behavior continued consecutively. Feeding was the behavior with the
most data to support an analysis of the length of its sessions. Sessions were
