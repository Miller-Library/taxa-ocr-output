MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Melibe leonina were collected off of Del Monte Beach in Monterey during
free dives and SCUBA dives. They are found on solitary Macrocystis pyrifera
kelp plants, in crowded populations of hundreds of individuals. Tanks under
the shed at Hopkins were set up with a continuous sea water flow to hold the
animals for further experimentation. Kelp and snails in the tanks provided a
substrate and a natural cleaning service, respectively. A total of five holding
tanks were used and approximately 100 Melibe were collected over the
course of the ten weeks. All animals left at the end of the ten weeks were
returned to their original kelp bed.
Each of the five tanks for natural behavior observations, also set up
under the shed, contained one blade of Macrocystis kelp, one or two snails,
and two Melibe. As each animal was placed in a tank, it was measured for
volume by water displacement and studied to find unique characteristics for
later recognition. One animal from each study tank was injected with
methylene blue dye in its right first cerata to aid in differentiation.
All study animals were kept in as similar conditions as possible. They
were fed every other day with mysids collected off of the kelp in Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge. Tanks were cleaned out every two weeks, but never on ar
observational day. Melibe were never disturbed unless it became necessary
to change something in the tank, if a death occurred, or if the drain clogged.
Observations were made in six hour sessions, at fifteen minute intervals.
Daytime and nighttime behaviors were recorded for a total of sixty-six hours
of observations. Behaviors were recorded on tank sheets (figure 2) and
compiled into tables (figure 3).
The statistical analysis methods were mainly comprised of chi-square
tests for significance of different behavior patterns using the equation
Xa-2 (0.-E. P/E.
where O is the observed value and E is the expected value. Counting of the
