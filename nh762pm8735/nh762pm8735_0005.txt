various sequences of behaviors was done by an original program written in
Pascal on a Macintosh personal computer.
Transitional probabilities were assumed to be equal to the observed
transitional frequencies. They were used to calculate the probability of
occurrence of three behavior sequences using the equation
P(ABC)-P(A)P(BIA)P(CB)
where A, B, and Care any three behaviors (Oden, 1977).
