ABSTRACT:
The nudibranch mollusc Melibe leonina has been shown to be useful for
neurophysiological studies due to its relatively simple nervous system. As a
precursor to understanding nerve pathways for behavior lies the study of the
behaviors themselves. Spontaneously occurring behavior of Melibe was
observed and analyzed to determine patterns and predictability. Nine
individually occurring behaviors and copulat ion made up the behavior catalog
that was used. Results showed that there is an exponential transition rate
out of the feeding mode of Melibe that there is a correlation between time
spent feeding and size of the animal, and that the patterns of behavior can be
predicted by a stochastic, one-step transitional probability matrix. Two
behavior loops are also present in the Melibe which may demonstrate a
hormonal change between them. The predictability of behavior can assist
electrophysiological studies with live animal preparations by allowing the
researcher to predict and prepare for certain behaviors.
