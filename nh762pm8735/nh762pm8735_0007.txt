tabulated for each animal and the results graphed (figure 10). An exponential
describes the best fit of the data. The equation y-C10 (-kt) calculated for
all animals with enough data to support analysis, showed that each antmal
had a different decay rate. When volume was graphed versus the mean feeding
session length, derived from the k-constant, there was shown to be no
significant correlation (figure 6). The k-constant can be converted to mean
feeding session length using the equation (mean t) = 0.3017K.
To see if a one-step transition frequency matrix is enough to describe
longer sequences of behavior, I used the equation presented in the methods to
calculate predicted frequencies of sequences of three behaviors (or two-step
transitions), starting with the behaviors F, OH, AL, and RST. The one-step
probabilities were taken from figure 7. The observed and predicted matrices
of occurrences of triplet sequences are in figure 11, with the corresponding
chi-square values in figure 12. These matrices were graphed 3-dimensionally
in order to visualize the similarities between the predicted and observed
frequencies (figure 13) using the computer software "Surfer
