decided to attempt a less reductionistic approach to behavior by studying
behaviors occurring in a simulated natural habitat.
In spontaneous behavior, transitions between observable behaviors
become more important than dominance. At the neural level, transitions
between behaviors and decisions to make those transitions are probably
controlled by very different mechanisms than those involved in dominance.
while transitions may come in response to changing external and internal
states, Ã  dominance hierarchy shows only where one mechanism can overrule
another.
The model developed to describe patterns of behavior involves stochastic
one-step transitions. A stochastic process is one in which a randomly
determined sequence of behaviors is considered a sample of one element from
a probability distribution (Random House Dictionary, 1987). Essentially, a
stochastic model involves transition probabilities between behaviors that
depend solely on the present state of the animal, reflecting no influence from
past behavioral states.
Melibe leonina provides many optimal conditions for this type of study.
It is a large, hermaphroditic nudibranch, with a very characteristic set of
behaviors. Transitions between behaviors are fairly slow, for easy
recognition, and its ganglia is large enough to facilitate neurological studies
(Thompson, personal communication). The three distinctive oral hood states
of the Melibe provide a physical apparatus for clearly observing behavioral
changes. Its environmental conditions are simple to replicate - a ratty blade
of Macrocystis kelp, flowing water, and a few snalls.
