High-Temperature Induced Torpor in Tigriopus californicus
Bingham
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Five populations of Tigriopus californicus were collected from four
different geographic locations along the California coast: a North pop-
ulation from Santa Cruz at Natural Bridges State Beach (37째 latitude);
a Hopkins population from 17-Mile Drive, Pacific Grove, just south of Point Joe
(36.6째 latitude); a South population from Los Padres National Park at
Willow Creek (35.9째 latitude); and a L.A. population from Flat Rock, Palos
Verdes (33.75째 latitude). (Figure 1) In Los Angeles, two populations were
collected from two separate tidepools located approximately 3 meters apart.
These two tidepools were very similar in composition and there was no
significant vertical difference, however, one of the L.A. populations (LA,)
is noticeably smaller than the other L.A. population (LA2) as well as the
other three populations.
The collecting pools were all closely matched according to size having
a surface area of approximately 300 to 400 cm. and ranging in depth from
to 10 cm. The tidepools all had total sunlight, were in the high splash
zone with little, if any, flora and fauna, and contained a very dense
Tigriopus californicus population. The substrate of the pools was also
controlled for, however, it varied slightly due to geological factors of
the location - the tidepools at Santa Cruz and Flat Rock are in sandstone
while the other areas are primarily granite. The test populations were
stored in 400 ml. beakers containing 300 ml. of fresh sea water which had
been filtered using a vacuum millipore technique with whatman GF/C glass
fibre paper on Hawp HA 0.45 millipore filters. The animals were fed
TetraMin fish food and the water was changed every four days. All five
test populations were acclimated for a minimum of 20 days at 200c 1.50
using a Forma-temp constant temperature water bath. Kontogiannis (1973)
