Figure 5:
The mean time to torpor, in minutes, and the mean temperature to
torpor, in degrees Centigrade, with standard error bars plotted
for egg-carrying female Tigriopus californicus from North, Hopkins,
and L.A. populations.

females and males of the same Tigriopus californicus population
on three consecutive test runs.
