INTRODUCTION
Tigriopus californicus, a harpacticoid copepod which inhabits high
splashpools along the Northwest Pacific coast, is capable of withstanding
extreme physical stresses. In the present study, the effect of high
temperatures on the torpor response of Tigriopus californicus was examined.
Different geographic populations were used to test whether there is a
difference in temperature tolerance due to varying environmental conditions
associated with latitudinally separated habitats. The test populations were
acclimated at 20°C to equilibrate them to similar recent temperature regimes.
To mimic natural conditions the temperature was raised 2°0 every 15 to 30
minutes. The torpor response of males and egg-carrying females at the same
temperature was studied for any sex differences. These animals were also
followed individually for several consecutive trials to ascertain individual
responses and the effects of repeated temperature stress.
