FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1:
The four different geographic locations along the California coast
from which the five Tigriopus californicus populations were collected:
the North population from Santa Cruz; the Hopkins population from
1/ Mile Drive; the South population from Willow Creek; and the two
L.A. populations, L.A. and L.A.,, from Palos Verdes.
Figure 2:
The difference in temperatures, in degrees Centigrade, at which
latitudinally separated populations of Tigriopus californicus
enter a torpor state.
Key for latitudinally separated populations in Figures 2 & 3.

Figure 3:
The difference in times, in minutes, at which latitudinally
separated populations of Tigriopus californicus enter a torpor
state.
Figure 4:
The time until 50% of the population was in a torpor state
graphed according to its geographic location along the California
coast. The line shown is a least squares regression fit to the
points. Key to the latitudinally separated populations: 1 - North;
2 - Hopkins; 3 - South; 4 - L.A.j; 5 - L.A.9.
