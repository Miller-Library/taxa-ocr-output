High Temperature Induced Torpor in Tigriopus californicus
Page 8
SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
There appears to be both microhabitat and major habitat differences
in the high-temperature torpor response of Tigriopus californicus corresponding
to their geographic origins. 38Â°0 is a critical temperature for all the
populations. The determining factor in high-temperature related torpor is
time, as the tolerance periods vary significantly between the populations.
Egg-carrying females can withstand high temperatures significantly better
than the males. There is a large variation within an individual's torpor
response to repeated high temperature stresses. However, the populations
as a whole do maintain a consistent order of the least tolerant to the
most resistant of temperature: North, Hopkins, South, L.A.,, L.A..
These findings suggest a genetic basis for geographic differences in
temperature tolerance as the 20-day minimum acclimation at209C would
presumably eliminate any different short-term adaptations due to different
environments.
