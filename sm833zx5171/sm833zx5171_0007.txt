other populations when placed in normal conditions.
The varying high temperature tolerance is further emphasized by the
tests with the select egg-carrying females from the North, Hopkins, and
L.A., populations. In this experiment, very discrete temperature and time
ranges were found for the populations. Again, in the experiment involving
sex differences, the populations as a whole maintained their high-temperature
tolerance order. The egg-carrying females did significantly better in high
temperatures than did the males. These results agree with field studies on
Tigriopus californicus (Egloff, 1966) which showed significantly different
sex ratios (8 males) associated with tidepool temperatures; the sex ratios
were 263 and 588 in the warm and cool pool, respectively. In Lebistes
reticulatas, the females also tends to be more tolerant of extreme water
temperatures than males (Tsukuda, 1958 as cited in Vernberg 6p; Vernberg,
1970). This hardiness of Tigriopus californicus gravid females has been
documented under other physical stresses, such as salinity (Nimkin), and
has obvious adaptive significance for survival of the species.
Individuals of Tigriopus californicus in consegutive runs showed much
variation in their repeated high-temperature torpor response. The increased
time to torpor between Run 1 and Run 2 indicates a temperature tolerance
step-up with a possible leveling off effect from Run 2 to Run 3. Under
natural conditions, this phenomena should be helpful for short-term as well
as longer seasonal climate changes.
