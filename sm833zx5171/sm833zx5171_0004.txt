38°C for 60 minutes, and then raised 1°0 every 15 minutes until all the animals
were in torpor. The readings were taken in the same method as was previously
described. In this experiment and the one following, the animals were always
kept separated in depression wells in order to keep track of the individual
animals.
To test sex differences and the consistency of individual Tigriopus
californicus on consecutive high temperature runs, 100 animals, 50 males and
50 egg-carrying females, from China Point, Pacific Grove, were tested
individually. in depression wells. The test animals were studied on 3
consecutive runs, 24 hours apart. The temperature was raised in the same
method as in the first experiment: 2°0 per 15 minutes to 33°C and 2°C per
1/2 hour from 33°C on up.
