(Fig. 3). The isolate sequence clustered with C. piscicola, but is only 92% homologous
to C. piscicola, and is no more closely related to any other Carnobacterium species in
GenBank (Fig. 4).
Discussion
The 16s and ITS sequence data indicate that the bacteria isolated from the four
individual sharks are identical, though the sharks were from separate beaching events
geographically and temporally. Of these four, the southernmost beaching was at Sunset
Beach in Orange County, and the northernmost was Bodega Bay in Sonoma County, CA.
One shark had beached in August 2002, while the other three were from 2003.
Since 16s sequences from species within the Carnobacteria genus generally share
97-98% or more homology (Genbank comparisons), the 16s sequence from our isolate,
which is more than 99% homologous to C. piscicola and averages about 98% homology
to other Carnobacteria species, confirms the biochemical and serological findings that
place this isolate within the Carnobacteria. The ITS data indicate that the bacterial
isolate is significantly different, however, from any currently known species of
Carnobacteria. Interspecific ITS variation within the Carnobacteria is approximately 4-
7% (GenBank comparisons). Our isolate is 8% different from C. piscicola, its closest
matching relative. Our isolate may prove to be the recently described arctic species C.
sp. Arctic P-2, the large intergenetic spacer region of which has not yet been sequenced,
or it may be an entirely new species within the Carnobacteria.
It could be that the young sharks, like many wild and cultured fish, carry
Carnobacteria naturally in their gut or on their gill surfaces. Though this particular
