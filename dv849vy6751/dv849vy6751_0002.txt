Ringo et al., 2001; Joborn, 1999). The bacteria of this genus are generally considered to
be part of the normal microfloral community in the gut and on the gill surfaces, and
pathenogenesis of the bacteria of this genus is rarely considered. In fact, species of
Carnobacteria are frequently found to produce bacteriocins, proteins that kill or inhibit
the growth of other bacteria, and this propensity has led to much interest in the use of
Carnobacteria species as a probiotic in aquaculture (Robertson, 2000).
When fish are physiologically stressed, however, they become more prone to
infection (Herman et al., 1985), and Carnobacteria can become septicemic and damage
the kidneys, liver, and brain (Baya et al., 1991). Hui et al. (1984) cultured Carnobacteria
sp. (then still in the Lactobacillus genus) from diseased rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and
Chinook salmon, all from fish that had been stressed by handling or by spawning activity.
Carnobacteria has been shown to cause mortalities in stressed cultured fish challenged
with the bacteria (Baya et al., 1991).
Carnobacteria have not been reported as normal flora in sharks, and this is the
first report of Carnobacteria pathogenesis in any shark species. Identifying the bacteria
at the species level would aid greatly in understanding the epidemiology of this infection.
Once the bacteria is identified, the route of infection may be pinpointed as environmental,
dietary, or congenital in future research.
Methods
Bacteria were isolated from four infected salmon shark brains and were cultured
by Dr. Barry Lifland of the Stanford University Comparative Medicine Department.
Liquid cultures were prepared for PCR analysis.
