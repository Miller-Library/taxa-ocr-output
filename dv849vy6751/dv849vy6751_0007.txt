isolates do not match with any known Carnobacteria species known to Genbank, but
cluster most closely to C. piscicola, and an isolate from the Arctic, C. spp P-2. The
epidemiology of this disease will be understood with further investigation into the
identity and natural habitat of the isolate, and the lifestyle of juvenile and adult salmon
sharks.
