and ITS sequencing in 10 uL volumes with 6 uL ddH2O, 1.5 uL 5x buffer, 1 uL Big Dye,
0.5 uL of either forward or reverse primer, and 1 uL of SAP/EXÖ template. The product
DNA was precipitated with 40 uL of 75% isopropanol per reaction. The reaction tubes
were centrifuged for 1 hour at - 3600 rpm, and were then spun upside down for 1 minute
at 700 rpm to remove the isopropanol. The pelleted DNA of was then resuspended in 20
uL of Hi Dye, denatured for 2 minutes at 96 °C, and inserted into an ABI 3100 Genetic
Analyzer. Forward and reverse sequences were edited by eye and the consensus
sequences were sent to GenBank to garner initial similarities. The consensus sequences
were aligned with known Carnobacterium species 16s and ISR sequences. Using
ClustalW, PAUP was used to create neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees comparing the
amplified sequences to sequences from known Carnobacterium spp.
Results
PCR with primers Carnol6sF and Carno l6sR amplified a region of-541 base
pairs that was identical to all samples, and nearly identical to the 16s rDNA of C.
piscicola and to a recently examined species from the Arctic, Carnobacterium sp Arctic
P-2 (Lee et al., 2004 unpublished data) (Fig. 1). The sole difference from C. piscicola is
a single base pair insertion in the C. piscicola sequence that is absent in the sequence
from our bacteria. The sole difference from the Arctic species is a single base change.
The 16s isolate sequence clusters with C. piscicola and the Arctic species (Fig. 2).
PCR with CarnolTS-F and CarnolTS-R yielded a piece of-540 base pairs. All of
the sequences obtained from bacterial culture were 100% homologous to each other. The
consensus sequence was not, however, identical to any Carnobacterium spp. in GenBank
