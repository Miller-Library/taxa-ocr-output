isolate has not yet been described from other fish species, colonization of the gut may
occur via the salmon shark diet, which in the adults consists primarily of salmonid fish
known to carry Carnobacteria species. If the sharks harbor this Carnobacteria isolate
naturally and then encounter stressful conditions along northern California, the bacteria
may proliferate and infect the brain, causing disorientation and beaching. The infections
may be peculiar to salmon shark juveniles due to some unique behavior or aspect of the
juvenile life history, such as coastal migration, not shared by the adults or other species.
Alternatively, since salmon sharks are ovoviviparous, the young sharks could
contract the bacteria at birth, if their mothers are infected. Adult salmon sharks may be
affected with the bacterial meningitis, and may simply beach in areas that arenâ€™t heavily
accessed by the public, since these sharks inhabit the northern Pacific where coastal
communities are less frequent. Or perhaps the pelagic adult life prevents sick individuals
from beaching on shore where they would be found.
Why other sharks are unaffected by this bacterial meningoencephalitis is not
clear. If exposure to the bacteria comes through the diet, then other shark species that
prey on salmonid fishes, herring, or any other piscine species known to harbor
Carnobacteria, should be affected. Yet no species other than salmon sharks have been
observed to beach as regularly or as predictably as salmon sharks do.
Conclusion
An unusual Carnobacterium spp. has been isolated from the brains of beached
salmon sharks suffering from acute meningoencephalitis with intralesional bacteria. The
isolates share 100% homology with each other at both the 16s and large ITS regions. The
