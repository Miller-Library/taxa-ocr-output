Primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Carnol6sF (5’-
ATACATGCAAGTCGAACGC-3’) and Carnol6sR (5’¬
ATAAATCCGGACAACGCTTGCCA-3’) were custom designed to amplify a -500 bp
region of the Carnobacterium 16s ribosomal DNA gene for analysis. CarnolTS-F (5’-
TGGTTCGAGTCCATTTAGGCCCA-3’) and CarnolTS-R (5’¬
CTTACAGCTCCCCAAAGCATAT-3’) were custom designed to amplify a region of the
large intergenic spacer region determined by Kabadjova (2002) to differentiate between
C. piscicola, mobile, divergens, and gallinarum.
PCR reactions were carried out in 25 uL volumes containing 18 uL ddH2O, 2.5 uL
PCR buffer, 2.5 uL 0.8 umol dNTP, 0.5 uL of each primer, 0.06 uL of AmpliTag (WHO),
and 1 uL of bacterial liquid culture. Denaturation was at 94 °C for 1.5 minutes.
Successful annealing temperatures for Carno 16sF and Carno l6sR ranged from 53.8 °C to
59.7 °C, maintained for 30s. Extension was performed at 72 °C for 1 minute, and the
cycle was carried out 33x. For ITS amplification, the cycle was 94 °C for 30 seconds,
59.5 °C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 °C for 1 minute, carried out 33x.
Completed PCR reactions were screened on 1.5% agarose gels for successful
amplification. To remove ssDNA and primers from the PCR reactions and make the
amplified DNA inert, SAP/EXO reactions were performed in 7 uL volumes containing
0.5 uL of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) enzyme, 0.5 uL of Exonuclease, 0.25 uL
SAP buffer, and 5 uL of PCR template buffer per reaction. The reaction was carried out
at 37 °C for 30 minutes and then the enzymes were denatured at 80 °C for 15 minutes.
Sequences of 16s and ISR were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain
termination method. Both forward and reverse sequencing reactions were carried for l6s
