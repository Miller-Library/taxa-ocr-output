vicinity of the canyon wall; the other set of dives takes place approximately
one mile off the canyon wall.
By use of the methods above, the relative abundance of A. uvaria was
determined by depth and habitat type. In addition, the general feeding
pattern and gut contents are also described.

Distribution
The depth distribution of A. uvaria was examined using the archival
tapes and database of annotations for ROV dives in the year 3/20/89-
3/20/90. All noted citations for Apolemia in the archives were reviewed in
order to deter mine the number of colonies observed and the depth at which
observations were made.
In order to determine the relative abundance of A. uvaria over various
ranges of depth, it was necessary to formulate an accurate measure of the
area sampled by the ROV in each depth range. The amount of time spent in
each depth range was used to measure the approximate area sampled by the
ROV. In order to determine the time spent in each depth range, all depth
reports by the ROV's computer with a value falling within the given range
were counted over the year examined in this study. On average, these depth
reports are recorded at two second intervals (Bruce Gritton, MBARI database
manager). Therefore, the following equation was used to determine the time
spent in a particular depth range:

This value was calculated over the following intervals: 0-25 meters,
