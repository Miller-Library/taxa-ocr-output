depths where Apolemia is found and determine if there is a high degree of
variability in prey abundance. In addition, it would be useful to analyze gut
contents from more samples collected at depth and fixed immediately upon
capture. If variation in percentages of gastrozooids containing prey was
found, this would further support the presence of a flexible feeding strategy.
A study of prey size in relation to gastrozooid size would also be helpful in
deter mining the role of gastrozooid size in allowing consumption of variable
prey.
In summary, the resources of MBARI have allowed a more quantitative
estimate of the depth distribution of a phynosect than previously possible.
Further, it was possible to collect and conduct a gut content analysis of
gastrozooids collected from intact organisms at depth instead of fragments
that have drifted to the surface. This provides a better estimate of the
feeding behavior of the intact colony in its deep-water habitat.
