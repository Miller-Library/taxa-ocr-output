meters. The latitude and longitude of the collection site is shown in figure 1.
It is important to note that this is a site near the canyon wall.
Gut Content Analysis
The contents of the 189 gastrozooids total collected from both techniques
were isolated by dissection under 1.7-30 times magnification. The data
recorded included the length of the longest side of each gastrozooid, prey
description, prey size, and percentage of gastrozooids containing prey. This
data is similar to that gathered by others on several other siphonophore
species, making comparisons of general feeding patterns convenient
(Purcell, 198 1a, 1981b, 198 1c, 1982, 1983; Purcell and Kremer, 1983; Biggs
1977).
Results:
Distribution
The data used to calculate the depth distribution of A. uvaria are shown
in Table 1. Abundance appears to increase with depth below 250 meters.
Apolemia was not sighted above 250 meters during the year studied. A
graphical representation of the relationship of density to depth range is
included (Figure 3). Similar data for the canyon wall dives (Table 2) and the
dives one mile off the wall (Table 3) are also recorded. The abundance of A.
uvaria was found to be significantly higher in the canyon wall habitat.
Distribution by depth in both of these two habitats followed the pattern
established above, with abundance increasing with depth and no sightings
above 250 meters. A comparison between the two habitats of the density by
depth range is shown graphically (Figure 4).
Gut Content Analysis
The data collected on gastrozooid contents are summarized in Table 4.
The samples gathered by the sediment trap showed a higher percentage of
