Collection of Samples
The phynosect A. uvaria was collected using two different techniques.
Three individuals were collected using the ROV suction sampler. This
consists of a tube mounted on a poseable arm that uses suction to place
samples into separate, sealed plastic cylinders. Using this technique,
gastrozooids can be collected intact and preserved later at the surface to stop
digestion. The colony itsesf is broken apart by this procedure. Individuals
were collected on two separate daytime dives. Those ROV samples collected
on 5/1/90 were preserved in 802 ethanol; those collected on 5/7790 were
preserved in 102 solution of saturated formalin in seawater. These samples
were preserved from three to five hours after collection. All ROV samples
were collected at the C-4, C-5 canyon wall dive site as shown in figure 1.
The second technique used to obtain gastrozooids involved the use of a
sediment trap to fix live colonies in situ Cynthia Pilskaln of MBARI
provided these samples. The detailed construction and operation of this
apparatus is described by Honjo and Doherty (1987) and the discussion
below is intended as an overview. A diagram of the trap is included as
figure 2. The trap is suspended in the water column and collects samples
passively in its conical portion for a period of two weeks. As the samples are
funnelled into the collecting cylinders they are im mediately preserved with
a buffered for maldehyde solution. Thus, the colonies swim into the trap and
are immediately fixed, halting digestive processes. The exact number of
individuals captured by this technique is unknown because only the
gastrozooids are recovered intact. The three sets of trap samples were each
collected in two week intervals beginning 9/6/89 and ending 10/4/89. The
collections took place 100 meters above the canyon floor at a depth of 500
