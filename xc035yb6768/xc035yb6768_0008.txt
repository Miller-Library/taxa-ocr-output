ab undance at these deeper depths. Twelve other siphonophores have been
shown to have distribution tails beginning at about the same depth by
Margulis (1980) and extending to deep waters approaching 4000 meters. No
estimate of abundance by depth range was calculated in that study.
Further, taxonomical and morphological data are not available for
comparison given the previously stated difficulties of studying deep water
siphonophores.
The distribution by habitat type indicated a greater abundance close to
the canyon wall as opposed to one mile off the wall. In fact, several intact
individuals can often be seen in close proximity to one another in areas near
the canyon wall. This correlates with the high percentage of sergestids
found during gut content analysis. Visual observation seemed to indicate
that sergestids were more abundant in areas closer to the canyon wall.
Unfortunately, plankton tows haven't yet been collected and analyzed to
confirm this observation. It is important to note that colonies can be
observed in very close interaction with the canyon wall. Some colonies were
recor ded on videotape being caught up on the rocky substrate and
fragmenting. The gut content analysis carried out by Purcell (1981a) was
based on similar tail fragments that apparently drifted to surface waters
once separated from their nectophores.
The study of digestion patterns in A. uvaria sets it apart from other
species previously examined. The combination of large gastrozooids in great
numbers implies a novel feeding strategy among siphonophores studied. In
general, Purcell (198 1a) classified siphonophores into one of two categories:
those having small gastrozooids («1 mm) in large number ( 20) and those
having large gastrozooids O 1 mm) in smaller numbers («20). Phynosects
were generally found to have large gastrozooids in smaller numbers.
