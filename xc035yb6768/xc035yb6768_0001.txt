Abstract:
This paper presents a method of determining the relative abundance of
the siphonophore species Apolemia uvaria in relation to depth in the
Monterey Bay Canyon. This species of phynosect was found to exist intact
only at depths below 250 meters. Further, density increased with depth
below this level. In addition, it was found to be more abundant in habitats
close to the canyon wall as compared to one mile off the wall. The unique
resources of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and its
remote operated vehicle (ROV) were used to study and collect these
organisms.
A gut content analysis and description of the general feeding pattern of
A. uvaria was also conducted with samples collected at depths of up to 500
meters. It was shown to have a novel feeding strategy in comparison to
other siphonophores studied. In particular, its numerous, large gastrozooids
allow for flexibility in prey size and percentage of gastrozooids containing
prey.
Introduction:
Quantifving the depth distribution of deep-water siphonophores has
proven difficult to accomplish. In particular, phynosects are extre mely
fragile and canâ€™t be collected by closing net systems (Pugh 1984). As a
result, only depth ranges have been recorded for species of this suborder of
siphonophores (Mackey 1987). This paper attempts to quantify the depth
distribution of the phynosect A. uvaria. This species of giant apole mid has
been observed at lengths of up to thirty meters. It has been previously
sighted intact by the submersibles "Alvin" and Johnson-Sea-Link (Mackey
1987) and is often seen in fragments at shallow depths. The abundance
