Further, those species having large numbers of small gastrozooids had a
lower percentage of gastrozooids with prey («202) and consumed smaller
prey items. A. uvaria had a highly variable percentage of gastrozooids with
prey (11-502) and consumed prey of variable size (1.5-14.5 mm). The
variation in the percentage of gastrozooids containing prey may simply be a
result of the fact that the ROV samples digested and egested some of their
gut contents in the time between capture and preservation. The sediment
trap samples had a variation from 412 to 502 while the ROV collected
samples had only from 112 to 172 of gastrozooids containing prey. Biggs
(1977) found that egestion rates in siphonophores could be as rapid as 3-4
hours. However, in the two fragments analyzed by Purcell (1981a), the
percentages of gastrozooids containing prey were 152 and 82.62. This
variation existed even though both samples were fixed immediately after
capture, halting all digestive processes. Unfortunately, the
representativeness of those samples is suspect because they were fragments
found well above the normal depth range of intact individuals. Another
possibility is that the sediment trap samples were preserved at night, while
the ROV samples were collected during the day. Several siphonophores have
been shown to show diel differences in feeding (Purcell, 1981a).
In any case, the physiological characteristics of A. uvaria imply à
synthesis of the two feeding strategies described by Purcell. Apolemia
combines large gastrozooids with great numbers, allowing more flexibility in
its feeding pattern. In particular, large gastrozooids of variable size allow a
wider variety of prey to be consumed and large numbers allow many more
prey to be grazed. A variability in percentages of gastrozooids containing
prey would also imply the ability to be flexible to variations in prey
availability. It would again be interesting to take plankton samples at
