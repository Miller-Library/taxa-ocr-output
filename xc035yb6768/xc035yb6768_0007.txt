gastrozooids with prey compared to those collected using the ROV's suction
sampler. This may be a consequence of the fact that the ROV samples were
preserved hours after being collected. Digestive processes and egestion of
contents may have occurred as a result of the delay.
The trap specimens all had sergestids as a significant part of their diets.
It is important to note that the unidentified digested material was most
likely not sergestid soft body parts since examination of the material under
30 times magnification revealed no exoskeletal parts. Gastrozooid length
along the longest side varied from 1.95-16.25 millimeters. Both the size and
variation of size of the gastrozooids are large in comparison to other
siphonophore species (Purcell, 198 1a). Further, the number of gastrozooids
per individual was determined by videotape observations to exceed two
hundred gastrozooids per colony in some organisms. Among siphonophores,
this is considered to be a numerous amount (Purcell, 198 1a).
Discussion:
The unique resources of MBARI offer an opportunity to study organisms
below the epipelagic zone with greater ease than previously available. The
videotape archive provides an accessible body of infor mation and
observation for many organisms. Combined with the ROV's sampling
capabilities, it provides the tools to observe and collect otherwise elusive
organisms. In this paper, I have presented a technique by which these tools
can be used to quantify distributional questions. Using this technique, it was
found that A. uvaria has a depth range starting below 250 meters, with
density increasing with depth. The deep end of the depth range is currently
unknown because the ROV tether only allows it to reach maximum depths of
about 450 meters. This capability will soon be increased significantly to
1000 meters. At that time, it would be useful to examine the relative
