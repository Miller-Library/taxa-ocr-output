relative to habitat was also examined and quantified. The habitats compared
were defined by their proximity to the Monterey Bay Canyon wall.
In addition to addressing questions of distribution, a gut content analysis
was conducted by the collection and dissection of gastrozooids. The data
collected on dietary composition was compared to similar work done on
other siphonophore species to gain an understanding of general feeding
patterns. (Biggs 1977: Purcell, 198 1a, 1981b, 1981c, 1982. 1983: Purcell and
Kremer, 1983). It was also compared to limited work done on fragmented
colonies of A. uvaria that drifted into surface waters (Purcell, 1981a).
The resources of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)
provide a unique opportunity to observe these organisms in situ at depths
to four hundred and fifty meters. All dives by the remote operated vehicle
(ROV) have been recorded by a Sony Betacam DXC 3000 and stored as time
coded videocassettes in the archives. These tapes have been annotated for
all sightings of various organisms including A. uvaria. These annotations
include the date, time, video frame, depth, latitude, and longitude of the
sightings. This infor mation can be recovered and printed from the database.
Using the videotapes and database, the number of organisms sighted within
certain depth ranges and the time spent by the ROV in each of these depth
ranges was determined for a one year period. The density in a specific
depth range was defined as the ratio of these two numbers. Hence, the units
of density as calculated here are colonies sighted per unit time. This
technique assumes that the time spent by the ROV at certain depths is
related to the area sampled at that depth relative to other depths. Density
by depth was also calculated for two separate habitat types defined by their
closeness to the canyon wall. One set of dives is classified as being in the
