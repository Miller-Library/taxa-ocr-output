26-100 m. 101-200 m. 201-250 m. 251-300 m. 301-350 m. 351-400 m and
401-450 m. Above twenty-five meters, most of the time is spent at or near
the surface launching or recovering the ROV. The visibility during these
operations is low and the sampling time is greatly reduced. Thus, this range
has been separated to give a more accurate picture of the top one hundred
meters. It is important to note that during the year studied, the ROV did not
dive deeper than 450 meters. From the above infor mation, relative density
was defined by the ratio of colonies observed in each depth range to time
spent in that depth range, as follows:
of colonies observed in depth range
density (colonies/minute)
time spent in each depth range (min.)
In addition to examining the general depth distribution of A. uvaria the
distribution within two different habitat types in the Monterey Bay Canyon
was examined. The two habitats sampled were described as being either in
the vicinity of the canyon wall or approximately one mile off the wall.
Twelve dives taking place in the year examined were classified as being
canyon wall dives; twenty-four dives were water column dives taking place
about one mile off the wall. The latitude and longitude of these dive sites
are marked in figure 1. For each of these dives, the time spent in the depth
ranges of 0-25 meters, 25-100 m. 101-200 m. 201-300 m. 301-400 m, and
401-450 meters was determined in the manner described above. Again, the
frequency of Apolemia occurrence in each of the two habitat types was
deter mined with the units of colonies observed per unit time. This allows a
comparison of relative abundance and depth distribution of Apolemia close
to the canyon wall and in a habitat further off the wall.
