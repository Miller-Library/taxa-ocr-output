Figure 1 - Uptake of C-DDT by unfertilized eggs from an incuba-
tion medium of 0.56 ppb DDT.
Figure 2 - Rate of uptake of C-DDT (ppm/time) from incubation
media of different concentrations. Solid circles, hour
incubation time; empty circles, 1 minute incubation time.
Numbers in parentheses indicate relative rates.
3 - Growth of the longest skeletal arm in sea water at
Tigure
14-15° C. Length is given in ocular units (1 ou. - 1.25
microns). Solid circles, Expt. 1; empty circles, Expt.
12; triangles, Expt. 13; squares, Expt. 74.
Figure 4 - Experiment f2. Effect of incubation of 32-hour-old
embryos in 3 ppm DDT and 2.95% ethanol. The concentration
of DDT in the embryos is 4 ppm. Length is given in ocular
units (1 ou. - 1.25 microns). Solid circles, sea water
control;; empty circles, DDT. Numbers in parentheses indi¬
cate the length relative to the sea water control.
- Experiment 43. Effect of incubation of fertilized eggs
Figure
in 4.5 ppm DDT and 0.475% ethanol, and in 0.475% ethanol.
The concentration of DDT in the embryos is 13 ppb. Length
is given in ocular units (1 ou. - 1.25 microns). Solid
circles, sea water control; empty circles, DDT; triangles,
ethanol.
Figure 6 - Cleavage in sea water (solid circles), and with a
concentration of 13 ppb DDT in the embryos (empty circles).
See text for definition of Cleavage Index.
Figure 7 - Kinetics of hatching. Solid circles, sea water control;
empty circles, 7 ppb DDT in the embryos; solid triangles,
62 ppb DDT in the embryos; empty triangles, 2 ppm DDT in
the embryos; squares, 16 ppm DDT in the embryos.
