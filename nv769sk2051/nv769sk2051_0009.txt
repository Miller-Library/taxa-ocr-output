3.
The relative protein synthesis at different times after
fertilization is indicated in Table 3. Two concentrations of
DDT, and one concentration of DDE (the principle breakdown product
of DDT) equivalent to the lowest DDT concentration are shown.
(The concentrations determined inside the embryos are not knoun
accurately, because only non-radioactive DDT was used. The indi-
cated concentrations are from another culture which was pulsed with
C -DDT at the same concentrations.) Pulsing with DDT, DDE,
or ethanol increased protein synthesis by as much as two-fold.
Table 4 shows the average total uptake of C-phenyl-
alanine at the different times. It is interesting that during
hatching the amount taken up is nearly twice that during cleavage
or during the growth of the skeleton.
DISCUSSTON
The results described are clearly not definative, but
do indicate possible trends and areas of further research.
The effect on rate of skeletal growth is interesting,
whether it is caused by DDT, or by the short exposure to ethanol.
It may be that ethanol modifies the cell membrane in such a way
as to disturb normal salt balance; an interesting possibility
since Davis (1961) reports that a high ionic strength inhibits
carbonic anhydrase.
Further studies of the effect on skeletal growth should
certainly be dine with complete ethanol controls, as well as a
more careful and consistent use of DDT concentrations. Considera-
tion should also be made of the effects of pulsing with DDT at
different times. It might be possible to alter the growth oftthe
skeleton after it has already begun normal growth in sea water.
In order to simplify and speed up the measuring procedure, I
