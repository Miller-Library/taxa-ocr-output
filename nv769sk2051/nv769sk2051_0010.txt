wCuld suggest the use of a camera lucida to make rapid sketches
which can be used for later, detailed measurements. This would
also allow for determination of the width of the growing arms,
and a computation of the length-width ratio. This, as pointed
out by Okazaki (1962), is a more significant measurement of the
deposition of calcium carbonate since the length is dependent
upon the shape of the organic matrix in which the skeleton develops.
The measurements of cleavage and hatching seem to
indicate that the various experimental condidtions did not affect
these aspects of development.
The results of determinations of protein synthesis are
interesting, but without more consistent and reliable results on
effects in other aspects of development, no suggestions as to the
significance of these measurements can be made. In future studies
of this kind, a parallel measurement of C-DDT should be done
to determine more accurately the uptake of cold DDT in the exper-
imantal cultures. Double labelling could also be done using
C14-DDT and a tritium-labelled amino acid.
Other parameters of normal development could also be
measured to determine the specificity of any effect on skeletal
growth. These might include the rate of gastrulation, respiration
rates, or aspects of behavior such as ciliary beat and phototropisms.
A complete study of the phenomenon would also include
gas chromatographic determinations of the "natural" level of DDT
in sea urchin eggs. Also to correlate the results properly
with a demonstration of the role of the carbonic anhydrase, a
complete in vitro study of the enzyme should be done. This would
include quantitative determinations of the in vitro effect of DDT,
as well as determinations of the activity of the enzyme at diff-
erent stages in development.
