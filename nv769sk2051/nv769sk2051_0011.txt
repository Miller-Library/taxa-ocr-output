SUMMARY
1) Methods are described for measuring:
a)the uptake of C-DDT by developing sea urchin embryos,
b)the rate of growth of the larval skeleton,
c)the rate of cleavage in early development,
d)the kinetics of the hatching process, and
e)protein synthesis during development.
2) There is some indication of an inhibition of the rate of growth
of the skeleton by either DDT or ethanol, while
3) there is no measured effect of DDT on either cleavage or hatching.
4) Both DDT and ethanol increased the rate of protein synthesis.
5) Suggestions are made for a more complete and reliable study.
