-3.
because of its codistillation with water, all experiments were
done with stopperred flasks, and solutions were exposed to open
air as infrequently as possible. For growing cultures, 25-50 ml.
of 0.1% egg suspension were placed in a stopperred 125 ml. flask
in a water bath at 14-15Â° C. Under these conditions the embryos
were in a single layer and development proceeded normally for
up to four days.
UPTAKE AND ACCUMULATTON OF DDT
Radioactivity was measured in a Nuclear Chicago Mark II
Scintillation Counter. For counting cellular material, the cells
were dissolved in Nuclear Chicago Solubilizer (NCS) and then
counted in a toluene-based scintillation fluid (4 g/1 2,5-diphenyl-
oxazole (PPO), 0.1 g/1 1,4-bis/2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene (POPOP),
in toluene). Bray's scintillation fluid was used for aqueous
solutions (100 ml. ethanol, 20 ml. ethylene glycol, 4 g. PPO,
0.2 g. POPOP, 60 g. naphthalene to 1 liter in dioxane).
C-DDT, uniformly labelled in the ring (Amersham/Searle),
specific activity 19 momM was used. A stock solution of 100 ppm
was prepared in 954 ethanol. Incubation solutions were prepared
either by adding the stock solution of C -DDT to sea water, or
by adding a small amount of the CDDT stock toldilutions of non-
radioactive DDT. Because of pipetting variations, the actual
concentration of C-DDT (and hence the specific activity of the
incubation media) were calculated from the radioactivity present
in a l ml. aliquot.
Stock solutions of non-radioactive DDT (Aldrich Chemical
Company) were prepared in 95% ethanol, and appropriate dilutions
made with sea water. To avoid high concentrations of ethanol,
the DDT stock solutions were made as high as 10,000 ppm. As DDT
