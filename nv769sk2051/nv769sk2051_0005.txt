was gently shaken to evenly distribute the embryos, and a drop
or two transferred to a glass slide. The sample was covered
with a glass coverslip and excess fluid drawn off with a pieceof
filter paper. Enough fluid must be removed so that the embryos
are pressed flat, and the skeleton is revealed but not crushed.
Measurements were made of the longest arm of at least 40 spicules
(20 embryos) using a 200 unit ocular micrometer, a 12.5x ocular,
and a 4Ox objective under phase contrast conditions.
MEASURENENTS OF OTHER PARANETERS
Cleavage
Examination of the cultures was begun immediately
after pulsing (about 2 hours after fertilization). Samples
were observed without a coverslip under low power in random
sequence, and at least 40 embryos from each culture were observed.
Embryos were classified as 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-or-
more-cell stages. A number from 1 to 5 was assigned to each of the
stages respectively. Unfertilized eggs were ignored. Embryos
in the process of cleavage were scored with the later stage.
A weighted average of the cleavage stages l to 5 was made for
each time of observation, andiis referred to as the Cleavage
Index. Thus if there were 21 embryos in the 2-cell stage (2),
18 in the 4-cell stage (3), and one in the 8-cell stage (4),
the cleavage index would be (21x2 4 18x3 + 1x4)/40, or 100/40 - 2.5.
Hatching
Beginning about 16 hours after fertilization, observations
were made every hour to determine the number of embryos which
had hatched. For each sample, the culture was shaken and a few
drops applied as a streak along a glass slide and examined from
end to end with a dissecting microscope at 25x. This procedure
