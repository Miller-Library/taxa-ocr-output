made it possible to keep track of the swimming blastulae already
counted. Unfertilized eggs were ignored, and the number of
swimming or moving blastulae was compared with the number of
non-motile blastulae. With little practice it was easily possible
to recognize these various forms under the dissecting microscope.
Protein Synthesis
One-half ml. of a 10% suspension of fertilized eggs was
pulsed for one-half hour in a solution of non-radioactive DDT,
washed as usual, and placed in 50 ml. of sea water in a 125 ml.
flask. At about 7, 19, and 50 hours after fertilization (during
cleavage, hatching, and skeletal growth), the amino acid incorp-
oration of these embryos was determined.
C phenylalanine (International Chemical and Nuclear
Company), specific activity 300mcm was used, and 0.148 micro-
curies added to a 12 ml. aliquot of embryo culture in a 30 ml.
beaker. After incubation for five minutes at 14-150 C., the
sample was divided into two 5 ml. amounts in conical centrifuge
tubes. Five ml. of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to
Tube I (incorporated amino acid), which was then placed in ice.
Tube II (total amino acid uptake) was hand centrifuged to remove
the sea water supernatant, and the embryos washed once with sea
water. Tube I was then washed with 5% TCA, 5% TCA containing
0.01 M. phenylalanine, and again with 5% TCA. Both samples were
then dissolved in NCS (0.5 or 1.0 ml.) and the radioactivity
determined. Percent incorporation was computed from the ratio
of incorporated amino acid to total amino acid uptake.
