INTRODUCTION
Preliminary studies with unfertilized eggs and developing
embryos of the sea urchin indicated the presence of a carbonic an¬
hydrase which was inhibited by DDT. The role of this particular
carbonic anhydrase during development is not known. Since the
skeleton of the sea urchin larva consists of calcium carbonate
(Yasamasu, 1959), and since carbonic anhydrase is involved with
calcium carbonate deposition in other forms ((Wilbur, 1964), I
postulated that this enzyme might be involved in skeleton form-
ation. If so, DDT might have a very specific effect on the rate
of growth of the skeleton, but not on other aspects of development.
Experiments were therefore initiated to observe the
effect of DDT on skeletal growth. Although methods were devel-
oped, reliable results were not obtained in the time available.
The purpose of this paper is to report these methods and to out-
line the experimental approach.
The methods of study will be discussed in three sections:
(1) uptake and accumulation of DDT, (2) measurements of skeletal
growth, and (3) measurements of other parameters of embryo activity
and development.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Shedding of gametes of S. purpuratas was induced by
intracoelomic injection of 0.5 N. KCl. Undiluted sperm were
stored at 5° C. The eggs were washed at least twice in filtered
sea water, and fertilized with a freshly diluted suspension of
sperm. Millipore-filtered sea water (0.45 micron) was used in
all experiments. The fertilized eggs were washed twice in sea
water and adjusted to a 0.1% suspension (V/V).
As great care must be taken in the handling of DDT
