tends to precipitate above the solubility limit of about 1.2 ppm
in water, and since-DDT tends to stick to glassware, the sea water
dilutions were made fresh daily.
For studying kinetics of uptake in unfertilized eggs,
1 ml. of a 2.5% suspension of eggs was added to 24 ml. of incu-
bation medium in a 125 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The stopperred
flask, kept in a water bath at 14-15Â° C., was swirled every 15
minutes. For each measurement, the contents of four flasks were
pooled, the eggs were packed by hand centrifugation, the supernat-
ant sea water decanted, and the eggs washed twice with sea water.
They were then dissolved in 1 ml. NCS and the radioactivity determined.
As a result of these studies, I decided to pulse dev-
eloping embryos in appropriate concentrations of CDDT for
one-half hour in order to observe the effects of DDT on develop-
ment. An accumulation of DDT about 50 times greater than that in
the incubation medium was predicted by the studies with unfertil-
ized eggs. For the studies with developing embryos, 1 ml. of
a 10% suspension of freshly fertilized eggs, or of 32 hour old
embryos, was added to 29 ml. of incubation medium in a stopperred
125 ml. flask and swirled every 10 minutes. After 30 minutes,
the supernatant sea water was removed, and the embryos washed
twice with sea water. One-fourth of them were returned to a
stopperred 125 ml. flask in a total volume of 25 ml. of sea water
for further observations of development. The remaining embryos
were dissolved in 1 ml. of NCS and the radioactivity determined.
OBSERVATTONS OF SKELETAL GROUTH
Cultures were observed in random sequence at intervals
of 2-6 hours beginning about 36 hours after fertilization. At
this time, the triradiate spicule has become apparent. The flask
