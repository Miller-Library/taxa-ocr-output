RESULTS
These results are described in order to give an idea as
to the type of findings obtained and the further work that is
necessary. They are not intended to be final or definative.
UPTAKE AND ACCUMULATION
Results of the kinetics of uptake studies are shown in
Figures 1 and 2. It is apparent from Figure 1 that the eggs take
up and concentrate DDT immediatoly and continue to do so for
some time. Thus, by one minute, the concentration of DDT inside
the eggs is 2.5 times greater than that in the incubation medium,
and by four hours has increased to 333 times the initial concenÂ¬
tration in the medium. Figure 2 indicates that the amount of DDT
taken up is almost linearly proportional to the concentration in
the incubation medium. This is true for both the one minute
and 30 minute incubation periods.
Uptake results from all experiments are summarized in
Table 1. Clearly more studies should be done to establish if
the difference in uptake between unfertilized or just-fertilized
eggs and later-stage embryos is significant. As the purpose of
these measurements was only to deter mine the actual concentration
of DDT in the embryos, further studies were not done.
SKELETAL GROWTH
Figure 3 indicates the rate offgrowth of the longest
skeletal arm. Extensive measurements from three control cultures
are shown, plus a single control measurement from another exper-
iment. There is close agreement among cultures 1, 2, and 4.
Culture 3 shows a much slower rate, although growth began at about
the same time. This difference may reflect the abnormal develop-
ment often observed near the end of the sea urchin breeding
