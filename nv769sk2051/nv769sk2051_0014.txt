TABLE LEGENDS
Table 1 - Uptake of C1-DDT by different types of embryos from
different types of incubation media. All incubations are
for one-half hour at 14-15Â° C.
Table 2 - Effect of incubation of fertilized eggs in 4.5 ppm DDT
and 0.475% ethanol, and 0.475% ethanol. The concentration
of DDT in the embryos is 13 ppb in Experiment 3, and should
be the same in Experiment +4, although the measurement was
not made. Time is given in Hours: Minutes after fertilization.
Length is given in ocular units (1 ou. - 1.25 microns).
Table
- Relative protein synthesis at different times in devel-
opment. DDE concentration (0.040 ppm) is the same molarity
as the DDT concentration (0.045 ppm). Measurements during
cleavage were made between 7 and 8 hours, hatching between
19 and 20 hours, and skeleton formation between 49.5 and
50.5 hours.after fertilization.
Table 4 - Total C - penylalanine uptake at different times in
development. Measurements during cleavage were made between
7 and 8 hours, hatching between 19 and 20 hours, and skeleton
formation between 49.5 and 50.5 hours after fertilization.
