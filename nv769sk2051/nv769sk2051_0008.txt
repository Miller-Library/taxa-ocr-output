season.
The effect of DDT applied 32 hours after fertilization
is shown in Figure 4. At 4 ppm DDT (determined in the embryos) the
rate of growth is slowed, but the final length achieved is the
same as the sea water controls. As DDT inhibits the enzymatic
hydration with carbonic anhydrase, but does not inhibit the
spontaneous reaction, such a result might be predicted. It
should be pointed out that this is a single experiment, and
proper ethanol controls were not run.
DDT pulsing with very low concentrations just after
fertilization was also done with the questionable culture (f3)
noted above. As indicated in Figure 5, ethanol alone seemed to
have an effect similar to 13 ppb DDT (determined in the embryos).
Table 2, however, indicates that in Experiment 4, at the same
concentrations of DDT, a much different response occurred. Another
factor which makes it difficult to interpret these data is that
there is a 2.5 hour delay between the measurement of the ethanol
control and the 13 ppb DDT cultures.
OTHER PARAMETERS OF DEVELOPMENT
Figure 6 indicates the rate of cleavage in sea water,
ethanol controls, and 13 ppb DDT (determined in the embryos).
There is no apparent difference, and the average is one cleavage
every 34 minutes. Subjective observations indicated abnormal or
incomplete cleavage was occurring in the higher concentrations
of DDT, but normal development followed.
Kinetics of the hatching process are shown in Figure 7.
(Notice that because of variability in hatching time, examination
of only "50% hatched" would not give an accurfate picture.) It
is apparent that the DDT had no effect on the time of hatching
