ABSTRACT
Methods have been developed for observing the effects of
DDT on the development of the larval skeleton in the purple sea
urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratas). These include uptake studies
with C -labelled DDT to determine the amount taken up by the dev-
eloping embryo, direct observations of skeletal growth, and obser-
vations of other factors which might indicate a general depressing
effect of DDT such as rate of cleavage, time of hatching, and rate
of protein synthesis.
