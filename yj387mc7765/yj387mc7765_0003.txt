This study sought to investigate the possible toxicity and pharmaco-
logical activity of the salivary gands of Nucella emarginata, and to further
elaborate the role of the hypobranchial gland - particularly to see if the
choline ester is included in secreted mucous. Hopefully this would add to
the knowledge about the feeding behavior and pharmacology of this snail.
Materials and Methods
Specimens -- 160 snails were collected over the course of 6 weeks, at approx¬
imately two week intervals. Nucella were obtained from near Fisherman's
Wharf, Monterey and at Point Joe, Carmel. Mercenaria mercenaria (cherry stone
clams) were bought from a seafood stand on Fisherman's Wharf. Mytilus
californianuswere collected at Point Joe and Point Cabrillo, Pacific Grove.
All specimens were stored in aquaria with running seawater at 14 C for not
longer than two weeks before use.
Assay -- Hearts of the clam, Mercenaria mercenaria and the mussel, Mytilus
californianus, were prepared in the method of Welsh and Taub (1948) with
several differences. The junction of each auricle with the central ventricle
was tied off with a length of thread. The heart was immersed in a 4 ml, bath
filled with seawater, and then stretched by means of the threads between a
glass hook at the bath bottom and the input of of a force-displacement trans¬
ducer (Grass FT-03). The transducer was hooked up to a polygraph (Grass 5A)
which recorded heartbeat on one of the channels. Air was bubbled up through
the bottom of the bath, and seawater circulating through the water jacket
maintained a temperature of 14 - 15 C.
gracts - The snails" shells were cracked with a pliers and the salivary
