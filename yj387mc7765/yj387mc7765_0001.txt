Abstract
1- Salivary glands of the marine carnivorous snail Nucella emarginata con-
tain a substance which causes positive chronotropic and ionotropic effects
on the hearts of Mercenaria mercenaria and Mytilus californianus.
2- Comparison of the effects of salivary gland homogenate with the action
of known doses of serotonin (5HT) on Mytilus hearts showed the glands conÂ¬
tain the equivalent of 23-85/g. 5HT/ g. fresh tissue. Thin layer chroma-
tography demonstrated that the glands contain less than 150Ag. 5HT /g.
fresh tissue.
3-Mucous secreted from the hypobranchial gland of Nuc
lla caused a marked
increase in tonus and eventual cessation of beat of!
tilus hearts, effects
similar to those produced by large concentrations of acetylcholine.
