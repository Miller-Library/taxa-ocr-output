glands dissected out under a dissecting microscope. Glands were weighed,
wrapped in parafilm, and stored in a freezer until used. Usually fresh prep
arations of glands were made twice weekly, each froma dissection of 10
snails (avg. weight glands.14 g./ 10 glands). On the day of an experiment
glands to be assayed were homogenized with a glass homogenizer in i ml.
of seawater. Known quantities of homogenate were added to the top of the
heart bath with a micropipette,or a plastic syringe with the needle bent
at right angles.
Hypobranchial gland secretion was collected on two separate occasions.
It was noted that snails prepared for dissection often secreted a colorless
mucous from their hypobranchial gland, which rapidly turned bright green
and then a deep purple with exposure to light. On each occasion, the mucous
from 4 snails was collected. The mantle was lifted carefully to expose the
mantle cavity ; mucous was collected with a fine forceps until approximately
1 ml. had been obtained. The secretion collected was dried on a watch glass
overnight, reconstituted in .5 ml. seawater. and added to the heart bath.
E - Thin layer chromatography plates (silica gel) were run in isopropanol:
NHOH : H20 (18:1:1) for twelve hours. .15 g. of tissue was homogenized in
5ml. of a mixture of acetone (10 volumes) and ethanol (3 volumes) to precipitate
salts and proteins, according to the method outlined by Lovenberg and Engel-
man (1971). The extract was filtered and the solvents evaporated off in a
flash evaporator at room temperature. The residue was dissolved in 100) methÂ¬
anol, and 75)were spotted. Plates were dried overnight, sprayed with Ehrlich's
reagent (Sigma Chem. Co.), and heated in an oven at 100 C for visualization.
