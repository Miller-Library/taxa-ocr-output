Introduction
Nucella emarginata inhabits exposed, wave-swept outcroppings of rock
along the North American west coast, where it feeds mainly on mussels and
barnacles. The snail can drill through the shells or plates of prey with
its particularly efficient radula aided by an acessory boring organ on the
sole of its foot (Abbot,in print).However, observations have shown that
Nucella paralyses its prey before eating, and may not require drilling to
gain acess (Gunter, 1968).
Nucella emarginata contains a pharmacologically active choline ester,
tentatively identified as N- methylmurexine, in its hypobranchial gland
(Bender et. al.1974). Keyl and Whittaker have shown that choline esters
block neuromuscular transmission (cited in Endean,1972). Espéramer (1956)
has also found large concentrations of serotonin (5- hydroxytryptamine, 5H
along with choline esters in the hypobranchial glands of some prosobranchs
of the superfamily Muricacea, to which Nucella belongs. The hypobranchial
gland, however, contains no duct to deliver these possible toxins to the
prey of the snail; it secretes à mucous into the mantle cavity which is
generally supposed to aid in excretion (Fretter and Graham, 1962). Con¬
sequently several authors have doubted this glands efficacy as an offensive
apparatus.(Endean, 1972: Halstead,1978).
Huang and Mir (1972) assayed salivary gland extracts from Thais (=Nucella)
haemastoma on various vertebrates and discovered that the gland contained a
powerful vasodilator and hypotensive agent. They suggested that the salivary
glands were the main poison gland of the animal. The glands contain ducts
which lead along the proboscis to the lower channel of the buccal cavity.
