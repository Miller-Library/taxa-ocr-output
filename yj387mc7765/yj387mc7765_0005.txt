Salivary Gland Extracts
Hearts of Mercenaria showed a marked response to both salivary gland
extracts and 5—hydroxytryptamine. Both substances caused an increase in
both tension (amplitude) and frequency of heartbeat (fig. 1). Doses as low
as .3 mg. gland / ml. in the bath produced significant responses. Unfor¬
tunately the hearts proved too irregular for quantitative comparison of
salivary gland homogenates to known doses of 5HT.
Mytilus hearts showed positive chronotropic and ionotropic effects
when salivary gland homogenate was added to the bath. Several hearts were
regular and responsive enough,so that it was possible to obtain an estimate of
the amount of serotonin equivalent per gram of fresh salivary gland tissue.
(fig. 2). A dose of 5HT was added and the response noted. The bath was then
washed, and an amount of salivary gland homogenate was added that hopefully
matched the former response. This wassuccessful on three occasions (three
different hearts). Calculations show readings of the equivalent of 23Ag.,
WOAg., and 85Ag. of 5HT per gram of fresh tissue.
Extracts of salivary gand spotted next to known concentrations of 5HT
on TLC plates showed that there was not more than 150/g. 3HT/ g. fresh tissue.
A more sophisticated method of purification was necessary for more precise
determinations.
pobranchial Gland Extracts
Dried mucous secretion reconstituted in seawater caused an increase in
tonus and cessation of beat in the two Mytilus hearts studied.(fig. 3)
These effects are comparable to those produced by large concentrations of
acetylcholine (fig. 4).
