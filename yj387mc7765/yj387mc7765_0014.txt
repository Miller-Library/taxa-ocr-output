Figure + 1. Effect of serotonin and salivary gland extracts on the heart
of Mercenaria. Arrows show time of application of the dose to the bath.
A.- Addition of 5HT to a final concentration of 10-° Molar in the bath.
B.— Effect of 1.5 mg. salivary gland/ ml. in the bath. C.-- Response
to .3 mg S. G./ ml.
Figure f 2. An attempt to match the effects of a dose of salivary gland
homogenate with a known concentration of serotonin. A.- The effect of two
large doses of serotonin on the heart of a Mytilus. B.— A similar
response obtainedby adding the shown amounts of salivary gland homogenate.
C.-- The addition of S.G. to the same final concentration as in B., show¬
ing that results are somewhat repeatable. This particular match showed that
the glands contained the equivalent of 85/g. 5HT/ g. fresh tissue.
The cycling behavior was common, and a nuisance. Amplitude and frequency
(max) are in parentheses above each characteristic segment. Doses rep¬
resent the final concentration of substance in the bath.
Figure + 3. The action of hypobranchial gland mucous (approx. .1 ml.
reconstituted in .5 ml. seawater) when assayed on the heart of Mytilus
on two separate occassions. Note the increase in tonus.
Figure + 4. Several responses to various doses of acetylcholine shown by
two mytilus hearts. A.- response of the same heart as in B., fig. 3
above. B.-- Response of a different heart, showing a slight difference
in reaction from the same dose applied in A. (.5X 10-° M.)
