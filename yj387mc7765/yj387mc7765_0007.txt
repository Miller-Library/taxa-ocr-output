genates of Mercenaria, the most abundant one being a tetrapeptide amide.
Two of the others seem to be peptides also (Price and Greenberg, 1977).
Obviously a more sophisticated assay of various tissues of Nucella for
5HT needs to be done before any conclusions can be reached. Several simple
methods for determining levels of serotonin in tissue have been described
(Lovenberg and Engelman 1972).
Hypobranchial Gland Secretion
The acetylcholine—like effect of hypobranchial gland mucous seems to
indicate that choline esters are present along with the purple dye in secre¬
tions of Nucella. This may explain the function of the gland. Several authors
have noted the presence of a purple stain around drill holes (Gunter 1968.
Hemmingway, 1973). The absence of a duct with which the hypobranchial gland
can serve to directly inject toxins into prey may at first seem to undermine
the theory that Nucella uses this gland to paralyze the molluscs it feeds
upon. But the mucous secreted has several remarkable features. Detailed
analysis of the hypobranchial mucous of the whelk, Buccinum undatum has shown
that it has highly viscoelastic and hydrophobic properties. Picking out a
strand of mucous from an aggregate and transferring it to another nearby dish
will cause subsequent complete transferral of the entire mass (Hunt and
Jevons, 1967). Personal observations of Nucella mucous confirm these findings.
Obviously hypobranchial gland secretions could be transported by the cilia of the
propodium to the drill hole site of Nucella prey without a diffusion of the
toxin. However, more work needs to be done before this theory is confirmed.
including collection and assay of the mucous under more natural conditions,
and a study of the effects of choline esters on invertebrates.
