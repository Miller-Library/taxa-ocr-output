Salivary Gland
The discovery of a cardioactive substance in relatively high concen¬
rginata suggests that these
trations in the salivary glands of Nucella em
glands may play a role in the observed paralysis of prey. The substance
may be serotonin. While it does not appear to be very toxic to vertebrates,
high levels of serotonin have been found in the salivary gland of Octopus
vulgaris and in the venom glands of many arthropods (Welsh and Moorehead, 1960).
The salivary glands of the carnivorous whelk Buccinum also contain a cardio-
excitatory substance which may be serotonin (Welsh, 1956).
Serotonin might serve to relax the prey of Nucella; for instance, it
may cause flaccid paralysis of the adductor muscle of Mytilus. Twarog (1960)
has shown that 5HT acts as an antagonist to acetylcholine in the anterior
byssus retractor muscle of Mytilus, causing relaxation. Welsh (1960) has
speculated that 5HT may facilitate the absorbtion and distribution of true
toxic substances. Nucella may useserotonin to enhance the activity of the
toxic choline esters which occurr in its hypobranchial gland.
However, it is possible that the salivary gland of Nucella is not used
to poison its prey; possibly the glands are highly innervated,with a sub-
sequently high concentration of neurotransmitter present. Kater et. al.(1977)
have shown that the cells in the salivary gland of a mollusk display action
potentials and are highly electrically coupled. Welsh and Moorehead (1960) have
demonstrated that the ganglia of some molluscs contain high concentrations
of serotonin, up to 60/g. 5HT / g. fresh tissue, and Lent (1977) has shown
that serotonin plays a major role in stimulating the activity of mucous
and/ or secretory structures such as the hypobranchial gland in gastropods.
Finally, the cardioactive substance in Nucella salivary glands may not
be serotonin. Four cardioexcitatory fractions have been resolved from homo¬
