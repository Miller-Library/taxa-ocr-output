Spider Fredation in Porcell:
INTRODUCTION
Cloudsley-Thompson (1958), reported birds, reptiles
amphibia, and many other insectivorous animals including
spiders, harvestmen, mites and centipedes as predators
of terrestrial isopods. For central Californian
woodlice, Miller (1938) listed as vertebrate predators
"at least two species of salamanders, several species
of reptiles, birds, and insectivores; among the
invertebrates, the black widow spider (Latrodectus
mactans) and various species of centipedes". Gorvett
(1956) has stressed the importance of the tegumental
glands as defense mechanisms in isopods; these organs
only occur in terrestrial species and the fact that
their secretions are distasteful to many spiders
suggests that spider predation has provided the
strongest selective pressure for their evolution.
Spiders thus appear to be at least potentially the
major predators on woodlice, yet detailed studies
of spider predation on isopod populations are almost
non-existent.
Porcellio scaber Latreille, 1804 is the
terrestrial isopod which shows the greatest development
of the tegumental glands (Gorvett, 1951). This species
is a member of the cryptozoan community, a term coined
by Dendry (1895) to describe the assemblage of small
terrestrial animals found dwelling in darkness beneath
stones, rotten logs, bark of trees and other similar
situations. Though cosmopolitan in distribution.
and one of the commonest isopods in the United
States, little study has been devoted to its interspecific
relationships, particularly those of predation.
Several groups of arachnids were initially
