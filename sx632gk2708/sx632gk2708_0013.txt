ACKNOVLÃ‰DGMEN
I am deeply grateful to Dr. Donald F. Abbott
and his wife Dr. Isabella A. Abbott for their guidance,
inspiration, and use of Querida del Mar in my research
as well as for sustenance during my field work.
For their positive influences on my personal growth
I will always be indebted.
For help in my field studies, special thanks
go to Dr. Eugene C. Haderlie for access to his home
as a study site and to S. Randall Pratt for assistance
with Porcellio scaber.
