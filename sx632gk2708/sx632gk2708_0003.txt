observed in their contacts with Pscaber under laboratory
conditions; these included solifugids, harvestmen,
wolf spiders, orb weavers, pholcids and theridiids.
The theridiid house spider Stoutoda grossa (C.L. Koch)
was found to be the most active predator on P. scaber
of all arachnids studied. It is the purpose of this
paper to discuss the natural history of this spider,
particularly its predatory behavior towards P. scaber
-

All studies were carried out at the Hopkins
Marine Station and around private homes in Pacific
Grove, California during the period April 27 to
June 9, 1973.
P. scaber populations were collected from both
the grounds of the marine station and from a private
estate near Asilomar Beach. The populations were
maintained in the laboratory in 30 x 20x 10cm plastic
tubs. A thin layer of dirt was spread over damp paper
towels on the bottom; this was covered with a layer
of grass and pine needles; and this, in turn, topped
with small pieces of decaying wood and bark. Tubs
were covered with aluminum foil and humidity was
maintained at a high level. As long as the paper
towels were kept damp an ideal environment was
maintained.
Most work on S. grossa was conducted in garages
and other human habitats. The main study area consisted
of one wall of a garage of a private home near Asilomar
Beach (fig. 1), which supported 115 individual webs
with 76 observed spiders.
Other methods used in specific investigations
are indicated in the appropriate sections which follow.
