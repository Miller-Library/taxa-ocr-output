Spider Predation in Porcellio
Maximum. It is reported that P. scaber prefers vertical
surfaces where moisture collects but does not become
excessive (Heeley, 1941).
The spiders are reported to have a six-year
lifespan (Kaston, 1953). The sizes of the middens
of old prey below webs suggests that they remain in
the same web as long as there is a good food supply
and they are not disturbed. Should they be disturbed,
they readily spin a new one in a suitable location
as seen by those collected for the laboratory. The
webs are discreet units separated from neighboring
webs (fig. 1). Two spiders do not share the same web.
When 10 hungry spiders were placed together they were
found to be extremely cannibalistic, killing off each
other until one remained. It then sat down to consume
the dead losers. In view of the large number of annual
offspring this activity would function to limit the
population size to that suitable for the amount of
available prey in the environment.
