Spider Predation inT
an accumulated garbage heap.
As is typical of primitive web builders (Kullman.
1972), the web is used only as a means of getting
information about the position of approaching prey,
and does not use special viscid threads to snare its
victims. Much silk is required and the webs are rather
complicated and irregular. Vertical tangles of
interconnecting scaffolding lines above, and drop
lines below and to the sides anchor the main sheet
of the web in place and provide additional means
for detecting and entangling passing prey. Sometimes
the webs are so compacted in a corner that they lose
their characteristic shape.
Once alerted to the presence of prey by vibrations
of the web, the spider advances rapidly and touches
the isopod or other prey with the pedipalps and first
pair of walking legs. At this point the prey may
be either accepted or rejected. If accepted, S. grossa
proceeds to swath the ventral surface of P. scaber with
viscid threads pulled from the spinnerets by the
fourth pair of walking legs. The prey is not rotated
as seen in species of Araneus, and not even held, but
rather is crisscrossed ventrally with silk in the place
of entanglement. The spider places occasional quy
lines to the dorsal surface of the prey and attaches
them to its web, acting to hitch the prey up into the
web. It may pause occasionally and if the struggling
is strong it continues to swath the prey in silk.
A series of short bites with the fangs is then
made through the ventral surface. One assumes venom is
being injected but it is not always sufficient to kill
P. scaber. The spider may then move a short distance
away from the prey for a period of several minutes or
less. If struggles continue it adds additional silk.
