Spider Predation in Porcollio
although they had been seen previously. However, on
the whole the population showed much greater activity
between sunset and sunrise than during the day (fig.5).
Relative humidity and temperature showed a correlated
maximum and minimum respectively, between 0600-0800.
Thus it was found that S. grossa, like P. scaber,
is principly nocturnal. Spiders are potentially
diurnal having an integument containing a waxy epicuticle
which acts to prevent desiccation. The more primitive
groups of spiders are secondarily adapted to nocturnal
habits, probably as a result of competition with more
efficient species (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1958). The
fact that S. grossa feeds upon P. scaber, a species
rejected by more advanced spiders, may further indicate
its inability to compete with these forms. In S. gross
as in P. scaber, the period of activity corresponds
best with the period of darkness rather than the
temperature or humidity directly, emphasizing that
behavior is cued mainly to light.
Predatory behavior is dealt with in a separate
section to follow, but a few observations of other
aspects of S. grossa activity and behavior are included
here.
Several of the spiders maintained in the lab
were observed to spin egg cocoons, one spinning a
second two and a half weeks after the first (fig. 6). One
typical egg sac contained 129 eggs. The eggs are
enclosed within a hollow,silk sac with a cavity of
larger volume than the eggs. When rotated the sac
shows the eggs to sometimes be tightly packed together
in a mass or else loose and able to roll around.
Four weeks after formation of the cocoon, the eggs
within had hatched and gone through at least one molt
