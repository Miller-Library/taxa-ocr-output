or humidity. The light regime provides the most
constant parameter of the environment and one easiest
for them to dotect. Numidity may also be of importance,
however; on the second night, and especially on the
third night of study (when bocause of heavy fog, the
humidity remained close to 100%) nocturnal activity
continued until a later hour at night.

The activity pattorns of 76 3. grossa were
monitored in the garage study area near Asilomar
Beach (fig. 1). An atomiser which sprayed a very
fine mist of water wha used to delingate the extent
of each web. The dreplets adhered to the web without
damaging it and without harm to the spider, and refracted
the light brilliantly. Within 20 minutes evaporation
restored the web to its original state.
Each spider was observed every two hours over
Ã  24 hour period. Spiders were scored as inactive
if hiding in their daytime retreats, and as active
if they were in a typical predatory stance in the web
or were actively out and moving about. Temperature,
relative humidity and light exposure were recorded
every hour from one typical web. During the night
spiders were observed with a flashlight covered with
a red filter, a procedure which appeared not to disturb
them.
The results (fig. 4) showed there is much
variance among the individual spiders with respect
to their periods of activity. Some individuals were
active in the predatory stance during the whole
observational period; others were not active at all
