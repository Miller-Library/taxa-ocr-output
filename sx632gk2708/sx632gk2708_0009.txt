Spider Predation in Porcellio
It then sinks its chelicerne through the ventral surface
of the proy and remains in this position for 1Â½ - 3
hours. Details of the feeding process were not followed;
presumably enzymes are injected, and suction applied to
ingest the organic soup created. The dead carcass is
eventually cut from the main sheet of the web.
If the packaged prey is small it may be carried
from the web periphery to the center of the main sheet
for consumption. While walking the spider carries the
package with one of its third pair of walking legs, and
it is held in a position between the spider and the
web. If the prey is larger (and isopods up to five
times the size of the spider were effectively preyed
upon) then it is eaten in the place of capture.
Additional details of predatory behavior were
gained from a study of 25 specimens of S. grossa,
2 - 10mm in body length, which were kept in the
laboratory for observation and experiment. I attempted
to feed these nightly between the hours of 2200 - 0200.
P. scaber of weight 20-35mg were introduced either by
dropping them into the mainsheet of the web in the
vicinity of the spider, or by placing them in peripheral
parts, or wholly outside the web.
Records of prey taken were kept for 19 S. grossa
(fig. 9). Predation is relatively infrequent and the
spiders averaged about five days between meals. Some
spiders endured at least three weeks without feeding
despite the presence of food and there is no reason
to believe they could not starve for longer periods.
The spiders were observed to have a poor sense
of vision. Isopods walking even within 5cm of the
spider never elicited a response unless the web was
touched indicating that detection of prey relies
