r Predation in Porcellio
Spide
BSTRAC
A population of the theridiid spider Steatoda
grossa in Pacific Grove, California was studied to
observe its predatory behavior towards the terrestrial
isopod Porcellio scaber and subsidiary prey items.
The isopod and spider are both found to be nocturnally
active. The carcasses of consumed prey are cut from
the spider's web to collect in a debris pile which
can be examined for an indication of long term
dietary consumption. The isopod, though rejected
as prey by most spiders because of repugnant tegumental
glands, composes 84% of the diet of this spider as
determined by web analysis. The spider from laboratory
experiments was found to go about five days between
meals but able to tolerate periods of three weeks or
more without feeding.
