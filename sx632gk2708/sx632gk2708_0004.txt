Initially activity pattorns of the isopod were
monitored in a natural onvironment on the grounds of the
Hopkins Marine Station. Twenty-two traps consisting
of plastic drinking cups were buried, with the lip
of each cup at ground level, in dirt and sand surrounding
a large patch of iceplant (Fosembryanthemum) bordering
the east beach on Mussel Foint. These traps effectively
captured and retained all isopods which wandered over
the lip. In addition, four 0.25m2 arcas of nearby
ranite rock surface were also monitored. Counts
were made every hour for 24 hours on numbers of
. scaber trapped in cups or detected on the rock
surface. Since activity proved largely nocturnal.
these populations were subsequently monitored on three
successive nights, and data gathered on physical
parameters. Temperature readings were taken with a
thermocouple heat probe and relative humidity with a
Honeywell portable relative humidity indicator from
Scm above the ground surface. Temperature was also
recorded from the iceplant habitat proper.
The results of these studies (figs. 2, 3) show
that activity in the P. scaber population increases
at sunset and ceases with approaching sunrise. Relative
humidity consistently shows a peak near 0300, with a
corresponding temperature minimum. Activity is maximum
earlier and it declining at this time. Activity from
sunrise to sunset is negligible.
P. scaber is sensitive to desiccation (Heeley, 1941);
in this connection it maintains a nocturnal activity
pattern, avoids dry places, and remains in a humid
environment. Judging from the data in fig. 3, activity
is most closely related to the absence of light
ther than to particular conditions of temperature
