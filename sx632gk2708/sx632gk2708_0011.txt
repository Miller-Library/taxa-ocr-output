Spider Predation in Porcellio
such as horse flies, beach flies, dragon flies, etc.
but there were also a few earwigs and other spiders.
Aside from these two webs, the main prey of
S. orossa clearly consists of crawling arthropods,
which blunder into the web on foot. I expected to
find dietary differences between spiders with webs
close to the floor and those high on the walls, but
no such differences were found. Webs were very abundant
occupying almost every available corner or crevice
in the study area, and everywhère except in the
window webs, P. scaber is the major prey. Two points
are of special interest in this regard. First,
P. scaber is probably the main food here because it
is most available rather than the most attractive prey.
In feeding experiments in the laboratory I concluded
that S. grossa does have a relative distaste for
P. scaber. On several occasions when an isopod had
been refused, a fly was introduced and elicited a complete
predatory response resulting in consumption.
A second point of interest is that P. scaber
seems equally available to spiders on the floor and
those near the ceiling. When P. scaber was released
on the garage floor they were observed to have no
difficulties climbing the garage walls, and on several
occasions marked isopods released on the floor were
captured as early as four hours Iater in webs halfway
up the walls. Climbing is probably part of the normal
nocturnal foraging activity of P. scaber. Bristowe (1941)
found that specimens in captivity would eat spiders
eggs. They also are observed to consume dead and
decaying matter inclüding dead members of the species.
The largest number found climbing on the walls were
observed around 0400 when the humidity was reaching a
