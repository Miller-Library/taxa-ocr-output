Spider Fredation in Porcellio
to produce unpigmented pre-spiderlings with definite
body form and capable of limited movement.
Since S. grossa is sedentary, the question of
where and how it obtains water is of interest. During
experiments with the fine mist atomizer, the spiders
were observed to drink water droplets from the threads
of the web. The legs and pedipalps were also used
to collect droplets from the web and bring them to
the mouth. This suggests that collection of dew
condensing on the webs provides an important source
of water for the spider.
PREDATORY B
HAVIOR OF ST
ATODA GROSSA
Members of the family Theridiidae characteristically
build irregular webs from the threads of which they
suspend themselves in an inverted position while they
await their prey (Levi, 1968). This is what I term
the predatory stance in S. grossa (fig. 7). Both
males and females were observed to spin webs, sex
determined in males by the presence of pedipalps
swollen at the distal end with the reproductive apparatus.
All of the larger web spinners were females as evidenced
by egg laying activity. The web of S. grossa is a
more or less closely woven sheet extending in a single
plane and consisting of threads running in all directions
with no apparent regularity (fig.8). The sheet
extends outwards from a hidden retreat in a crack or
crevice, in which the spider is generally found
when not in the predatory stance. These are the two
basic states of activity. Occasionally a spider
prowls its web laying new threads and actively repairing
damaged portions of the web. Litter or dead carcasses
are cut out of the web and dropped, where they form
