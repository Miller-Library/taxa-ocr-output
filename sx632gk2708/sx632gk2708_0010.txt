Spider Predation in Porcellio
primarily on vibratory stimulus. The isopods can alert
the spider to their presence in several ways. They
can fall directly into the web, trip over the scaffolding
lines and fall into the web, or become entangled in
drop lines or outlying guy lines. Subsequent struggles
alert the spider to a stereotyped response. Isopods
contacting the web are not necessarily trapped. It
was observed that P. scaber can walk upside down
either up or down a single thread of the web without
much difficulty.
The habit of S. grossa of discarding its old
prey in a tangled heap below the mainsheet of the web
made it easy to determine longterm diets for
representative spiders. Accumulated carcasses from
ten webs were taken from the garage study site and
analyzed for contents. Similar collections were made
from the webs of S. grossa in two other locations, an
open carport and a closed woodbox from a home on
Jack's Point in New Monterey. The results are shown
in figs.10 and 11. The same animals were found fairly
consistently in the webs, but by far the primary prey
of S. grossa as determined from the webs is P. scaber
with a frequency of 84%.
Moths form the second most commonly taken prey.
but only because of two very exceptional webs, occurring
at heights of 100 and 170cm above the ground in the
main garage study site. Both of these (and no others)
were taken from the window ledges; the primary prey
found here were moths and other flying insects,
undoubtedly attracted to lights shining through the
windows. Most of the animals classified under the
category "Other" or "Others", figs.10 and 11, occurred
in these two webs. They were mostly flying insects
