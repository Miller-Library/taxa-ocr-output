Methods
Respiration rate was measured with Warburg-Barcroft
manometers in a refrigerated water bath. Carbon dioxide
was absorbed in the vessel side arm using 0.3 ml of a
30% KOH solution, with a wick of starch-free Whatman's
The vessel constants for each run were

determined for the conditions of the experiment, the var¬
iables being the experimental temperature, volume of
flask contents, and the volume of the flask plus manometer
arm. The latter was determined by Umbreit's method of
calibration with water (Umbreit, 1945), and the approp¬
riate vessel constants then found from Dixon's nomogram
(Dixon, 1951). During each run the vessels were agitated
at the rate of approximately 60 - 70 oscillations per min¬
ute. The experiments were done during April and May, 1966.
The organisms used were medium sized A. scabra and
A. digitalis collected about 1 hour before low tide from
the +4 to +6 foot region of the intertidal zone near Hopkins
Marine Station They were then transferred to aquaria
supplied with running seawater at 15°C where they were al¬
lowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hours before being
tested.
Submerged and damp runs were made with animals temper-
ature-equilibrated for 3 hours before the experiment in a
finger bowl in the water bath. Animals used for determin¬
ing submerged respiration rates were then placed in the
Warburg vessels and covered with 6 ml of millipore filtered
