Both Acmaea digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833 and Acmaea
scabra (Gould, 1848) spend a considerable proportion of
the day exposed to the dessicating elements of the en¬
vironment. Several field studies have shown that, although
the two species are always found in close proximity, above
about the +5 foot level of the intertidal, A. scabra is
usually the only species found on exposed horizontal rock
surfaces (Haven, 1964).
This difference in exposure sug¬
gests possible physiological differences between the two
that might be revealed by respiratory studies. To deter¬
mine such differences, laboratory measurements of oxygen
consumption were made under varying conditions of temperature
and dehydration. The results showed a significant differ¬
ence in metabolic rate between the two species, as well as
differences in submerged and aerial respiration rates.
