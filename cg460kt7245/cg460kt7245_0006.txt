for the different temperatures, and they were equilibrat¬
ed for three hours at the experimental temperature before
being placed in the Warburg vessels. In A. scabra (Fig. 2),
it is seen that although respiration rate generally in¬
creases with temperature, it is not very pronounced; the
initial rate increasing only about 60% in going from 10°
to 25°C. It is also seen that that in A. digitalis (Fig. 3),
the respiratory rate is again relatively insensitive to
temperature, and between 20° and 25°C it actually drops to
a rate less than was found at 10°C. This same drop of
rate between 20° and 25°C was observed whether the first
measurements were made at 10°, then 15°C, etc., or whether
the first measurements were made at 25°, then 20°C, etc.
Discussion
Respiration Under Varying Exposure to Air
The data indicate that in both species the maximum
rate of respiration occurs under submerged conditions and
the minimum rate under aerial conditions. In both species
the rate during damp conditions falls between that of sub¬
merged and aerial.
A. scabra showed a much lower rate of respiration than
A. digitalis under damp and aerial conditions, a finding
which suggests a possible mechanism for conservation of
food reserves while out of water. This also fits in with
