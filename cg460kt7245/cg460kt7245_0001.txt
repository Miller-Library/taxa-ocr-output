Baldwin, Simeon (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford Univ., Pacific Grove,
Galif., U.S.A.) Manometric measurements of respiratory activity in
Acmaea digitalis and Acmaea scabra. The Veliger
Respiration in two species of limpets, Acmaea
digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833 and Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1848), was stud-
ied by means of Warburg manometers. In both species it was found that
the maximum respiration rate occurs when the animal is submerged, and
the least occurs when it is exposed to air. Under damp and aerial con¬
ditions A. scabra showed a much lower rate of respiration than did 4.
digitalis. Under conditions of increasing temperature from 10° to 250c,
A. scabra increased its respiratory rate approximately 60%. A. digitalis
rate increased 23% from 10° to 20°, but at 25° its rate had decreased to
less than that at 10°c.
