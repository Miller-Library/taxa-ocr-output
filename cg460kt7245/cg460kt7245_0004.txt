seawater. Animals used for determining damp respir¬
ation rates were shaken to remove excess filtered sea¬
water and then placed in dry flasks. Animals used in
aerial runs (no water included in Warburg vessel) were
placed foot down on a stack of 6 paper towels for 3.5
hours at room temperature (approximately 22°C) before
being placed in the dry vessel. With this proceedure
they were still able to attach to the sides of the vess¬
els.
For each experimental variable, animals were collect¬
ed under the same conditions and subjected to the same
treatment in order to minimize variables. Five separate
vessels were used containing 3 limpets per vessel.
Each run was repeated a minimum of three times using diff¬
erent animals so that each rate is an average of approx¬
imately 45 similar-sized animals taken from the same inter-
tidal area.
All respiratory measurements reported were made in
the dark, since preliminary runs measuring aerial resp¬
iration of A. scabra showed that photosynthesis of algal
growths on the animals' shells was producing signific¬
ant amounts of oxygen. Measurements of respiration of
empty limpet shells in the dark showed that the volume
of oxygen consumed was about 0.05% of the total amount
used by limpets during a 2 hour run. This negligible
amount was therefore not taken into consideration in the
