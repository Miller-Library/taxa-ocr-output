final rate calculations.
In all experiments shell sizes of animals used were
14 - 17 mm in length. Dry weights were determined by re¬
moving the shell and drying the animal to constant weight.
Rates are expressed in ul 0, per mg dry weight.

state of their environment are shown in Figure 1, This
depicts average oxygen consumption at 30 minute intervals
during the two hour measuring period. It is seen that the
damp and aerial respiration rate of A. scabra is consider¬
ably less than the submerged rate, the submerged rate being
2.25 times greater than the damp rate, and 4.36 times great¬
er than the aerial rate. By contrast, it is apparent that
the respiration rate of A. digitalis is not so markedly
affected by these conditions, the submerged rate being only
1.12 times greater than the damp rate and 1.42 times greater
than the aerial rate. It is also seen that although the
rate of submerged A. scabra is slightly greater than the
submerged A. digitalis rate, the damp and aerial rates of
A. digitalis are greater than the damp and aerial rates of
A. scabra.
