was the first and most sensitive body function to be
affected. This would be reflected in a decreased resp¬
ation rate as the critical mortality temperature was app¬
roached. Further measurements at closer increments from
15° through 30° should be made in order to determine the
exact point of rate decrease and the maximum tolerable
temperatures for both of these species.
In these limited laboratory observations it was im¬
possible to take into consideration daily and tidal
rhythms in respiratory rates that almost certainly were
present (Sandeen, Stephens and Brown, 1958). Other un¬
controlled variables that might have influenced the ob¬
served results are body weight and nutritional state of
the animals, since the intervals between last feeding and
respiratory measurements were unknown.
Summary
Respiration in two species of limpets, Acmaea digitalis
Eschscholtz, 1833 and Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1848), was
studied under varying conditions by means of Warburg
manometers. In both species it was found that the max¬
imum respiration rate occurs when the animal is submerged,
and the least occurs when it is exposed to air.
Under damp and aerial conditions A. scabra showed a much
lower rate of respiration than did A. digitalis. Under
conditions of increasing temperature from 10° to 25°c,
