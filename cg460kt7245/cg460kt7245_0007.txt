White's observations on glycogen content of high and low
forms of A. scabra (White, 1966).
All animals of both species were chosen with a similar
(thont shett
shell size, but the mean weight, of A. scabra was later
found to be 23 mg as compared to 59 mg for A. digitalis.
This could account for the finding that A. scabra had a
higher submerged rate than A. digitalis in that it
may be a reflection of a higher surface to volume ratio
for the former, rather than a higher metabolic rate.
Respiration Under Varying Conditions of Temperature
The increased respiratory rate at higher temperatures
was not as great as would be expected on thermodynamic
grounds. The reason for this is not known. The marked
drop in submerged rate of A. digitalis between 20° and 25°(
is interesting, since A. digitalis has a lethal temperat¬
ure during prolonged exposure of around 32°C (Hardin, 1966).
It is possible, therefore, that the decreased respiratory
rate is related to physiological derangements leading to
death. As no such decrease was observed in A. scabra, it
would appear that it is better suited to withstand elevat¬
ed temperatures than is A. digitalis. This finding also
agrees with the field observations on distribution, and
the lower tolerance to high temperatures of A. scabra as
compared to A. digitalis (Hardin, 1966). Southward (1958),
in a study on intertidal animals, found that during expos¬
ure to increasing temperature, the animal's activity was
