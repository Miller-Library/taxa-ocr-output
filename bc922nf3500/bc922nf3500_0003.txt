Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids

which have only eight vascular ampullae, were used. Pairs of oozooids
were observed to make a singular contact:ie,oneampulla of an oozooid
initiated contact by turning its tip to touch the side of a neighboring
oozooid's ampulla. The former ampulla shall be referred to as the
"aggressor" the latter being the "receiver". The sequence of events
that follows was seen to be much more complicated than that earlier
described by Tanaka and Watanabe (pers. comm. Scofield 1981), but
was not documented. It was the purpose of the present study to
observe the rejection process in detail and to document it with
photographs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Living colonies of Botryllus were collected from docks in the
Monterey Marina. Each colony was kept separate and at room temperature
in a 1L beaker, using the method of Scofield (submitted). The
developing larvae were brooded within the colony, and were allowed to
hatch as tadpoles. The beakers had been lined with glass slides on
which the tadpoles settled in a 0.5 cm wide band at the water line.
Twelve hours after the tadpoles had metamorphosed into oozooids, the
glass slides were removed for observation. Ampullar interactions were
observed and photographed (using a Nikon inversion microscope no.41368
and a 35 mm Olympus OM-2 camera) for a period of 48 hours.
