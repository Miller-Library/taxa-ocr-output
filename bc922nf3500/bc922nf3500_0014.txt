Rejeciton response in Botryllus oozooids
Figure 6 A-D. A sequence of photographs showing the third degree of
rejection response, involving an "explosion" of the am
ampullar of the aggressing ampulla.
A.6:00 a,m. The aggressor has begun a rejection response, with an injury
and bleeding from the ampullar tip. The receiver and the other
uninvolved ampullae show no response to the rejection in progress,
B.6:25 a.m. The aggressor continues to bleed profusely; no marked change
with the other ampullae.
C.6:45 a.m. The ampullar wall of the aggressor seems to have lost
its integrity; bleeding continues.
D.9:30 a.m. What is left of the aggressing ampulla has withdrawn under
the body of the oozooid, as did the other ampulla connected to the
same oozooid. A necrotic zone marks the site of the recent ampullar
contact. The other ampullae of the receiving oozooid seem to be
recovering from their response.

on the same oozooid; involving a "leaking" of blood cells.
from their ampullar walls. This type of sysemic rejection
response is seen only in the uninvolved ampullae of the
aggressing oozooid. This phenomenon was seen after tip-to-
side contact was established, but before bleeding was seen
in the aggressor.
Figure 8.
The aggressor has "jerked" back from the ampullar contact
leaving a small necrotic zone behind. The receiving ampulla
and adjacent uninvolved ampullae on the receiving oozooid are
showing no effects fo the recent incompatible contact.
