Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids
5 and 6, and table 1).
In the receiving ampulla, the responses to the incompatible
contact are much more subtle. In most cases, the receiving ampulla
did not respond in any visible way (see figs. 5 and 8, and table 1).
In other cases, the receiving ampulla withdrew from the ampullar
contact or became atrophied and clogged with static blood cells (see
figs. 3,4 and 6).
The second level of response to contact between incompatible
oozooids is a systemic reaction seen in the rest of the vascular
system and in ampullae uninvolved in a contact. Most commonly, the
uninvolved ampullae of either oozooid did not respond to the rejection
in progress between contacting ampullae (see figs 3,5,8). However,
in some cases, uninvolved ampullae of the aggressing or receiving
oozooid withdrew from the test cuticle, became clogged with static
blood cells and atrophied. (see figs. 4 and 6) or the adjacent
ampullae "leaked" blood cells from their ampullar wall before a
rejection response was seen in the contacting ampullar pair (see
fig. 7 and table 1).
