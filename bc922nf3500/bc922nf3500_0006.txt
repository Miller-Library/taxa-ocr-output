Rejection responses in Botryllus oozooids
DISCUSSION
Contact between the vascular ampullae of two incompatible
oozooids leads to a rejection response. The rejection response is
both local,involving only the ampullae in contact, and systemic,
affecting the entire circulatory system. There are varying degrees
of responses in the ampulla that initiated contact (the "aggressor")
The least invasive response,seen in 50% of the rejecting pairs, was a
loss of, or injury to the ampullar pad cells. In other pairs (4.23).
amputation of a portion of the ampullar bulb was seen. In the remaining
45.83, however, a violent rejection response occured, leading to the
disintegration of the wall of the aggressing ampulla. Thus, there
seems to be a heirarchy of rejection responses.
The genetic locus which controls histocompatibility in Botryllus
is polymorphic, with an 'estimated 40 codominant alleles (Scofield and
Schlumberger, unpublished). Therefore, each combination of histo-
compatibility alleles acting in an incompatible oozooid pair is
different. In the following discussion, I am assuming that: (1)
histocompatibility alleles may be structurallydissimilar (2) these
dissimilarities may lead to the rejection reaction (3) the structural
differerences in the histocompatibility alleles may result in the
differing rejection responses (4) the greater the dissimilarity
between alleles, the greater the degree of rejection between the
contacting ampullae. Certain combinations of histocompatibility
alleles may be more structurally dissimilar and may lead to a brisk
and complete rejection response (that of the "exploding" ampulla).
Likewise, other combinations whose alleles are different, but closely
in structur
related, may ultimately result in rejection, but may allow long-term
