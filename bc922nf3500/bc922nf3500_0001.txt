Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids
1.a.
Lauren Nagashima
The rejectionreaction following tip-to-side contact between two
vascular ampullae of two incompatible Botryllus oozooids differs in the
two ampullae. The ampulla that initiated contact (aggressor) forms
a distal blood clot and responds in one of three ways that differ
in their degree of injury to the aggressing ampulla: (1) loss or
injury to the ampullar pad cells (2) loss of distal end of ampulla
by constriction (3) rapid ampullar disintegration. The receiving
ampullacshowed a more subtle rejection response, as did some other
ampullae of the oozooid pair not involved in an ampullar contact.
