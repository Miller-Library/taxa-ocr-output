Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids
RESULTS
In these studies, it became clear that contact between incompatible
colonies can be considered at two levels: The local level, involving
only responses of the two ampullae that came into contact; and the
systemic level, involving responses of other ampullae (on the same
individuals), which had not experienced contact.
The first level concerns the individual ampullae involved in
the tip-to-side contact (see fig.1). The reponse of the ampulla which
initiated contact (aggressor) differs from the response of the

receiving ampulla (receiver). In the aggressing ampulla, three degrees
of response are seen. Common to all three degrees of response is an
abnormally largeamount of blood which is static despite contractions
and expansions of the surrounding ampullae of the aggressing oozooid.
The first and
least drastic degree of response is an injury to, or loss of, the
columnar epithelial cells or "pad" cells at the tip of the ampulla
within 24 hours after contact; bleeding may or may not occur (see figs,
2 and 3, and table 1). The second degree of response seen in the
aggressing ampulla is an amputation of the tip of the ampulla involved
in the contact. The process of amputation consists of a constriction
in, and subsequent pinching off of, a portion of the ampullar bulb. (see table 1.
fig. 4). This response occurs between 12 and 24 hours after ampullar
contact. The third degree of response is a disintegration or
"explosion" of the ampullar wall, releasing a mass of blood cells into
the matrix of the tunic. By contrast to the other two degrees of
response, this is a quick and complete rejection response occuring
within 6 hours after tip-to-side contact had been established (see figs.
