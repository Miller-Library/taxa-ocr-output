Rejection responses in Botryllus oozooids
The second source of the chemical factors may be the ampullar
pad cells. The pad cells involved in a "disagreeable" contact may
release a chemical signal that attracts blood cells and/or mediates
the local and systemic rejection responses,
Continued studies to determine the source of chemotaxic factors
and their role in the rejection response and the roles of necrotic
blood cells at the tip-to-side junction are in progress,
