Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids
Lauren Nagashima
INTRODUCTION
Contact between the outgrowing vascular ampullae at the margins
of different Botryllus colonies results in either a fusion of the
colonies or a rejection and subsequent formation of a clear boundary
between the colonies (eg. Bancroft 1903, Tanaka 1973, Katow and
Watanabe 1980). Current research in this phenomenon stems from the
recognition of the similarity between this allogeneic inhibition and
mammalian rejection of foreign tissues (eg. Scofield and Weissman, in
press, Burnet 1971). The most recent description of the rejection
response by Tanaka and Watanabe (1973) divides the process into six
stages. Stage 1: The vascular ampullae extend with the subsequent
contact of the test matrices. Stage 2: The ampullae migrate into the
test of the opposite colony and reciprocal tip-to-side contact of
the ampullae is established. Stage 3: Test cells surrounding the
ampullar contact become dark and opaque. Stage 4: Test cells aggregate
at the tips of the ampullae. Stage 5: Blood flow is decreased to the
ampullae involved in the contact; test material surrounding these
contacts becomes dark and opaque. Stage 6: The vascular ampullae in
the contact area are completely separated from the test circulatory
system.
In all previous published literature, pieces of grown colonies
were used to observe the rejection reaction. Because of the many
reciprocal tip-to-side contacts of the ampullae, a clear picture of
the sequence of events in one ampullar contact was not obtained. In
the method developed by Scofield (submitted 1981) Botryllus oozooids,
