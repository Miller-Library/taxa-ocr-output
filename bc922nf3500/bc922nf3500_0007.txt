Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids
contact beforehand (eg. loss of ampullar pad cells). The severity
of the rejection response seems to be inversely related to the time of
allowed contact and therefore may be directly related to the dissimilarity
between the histocompatibility alleles of the interacting oozooids.
There are two stages seen in the rejection response: The first
occurs during tip-to-side contact and is an aggregation of static
blood cells in the tip of the aggressing ampulla which then turns dark,
signaling cell death. The second stage is the local and systemic
rejection responses occuring after the tip-to-side contact has begun.
Chemotaxic factors may control both stages: (1) blood cell aggregation
and subsequent death and (2) the actual local and systemic responses
earlier described. On the other hand, the same factors may only
cause the aggregation of blood cells at the site of tip-to-side contact.
These blood cells may then release a second chemical factor as they
die, mediating the next stage of the rejection responses. Therefore,
the two parts of the rejection reaction may be coincidental or causal.
Possible sources of such chemotaxic factors are (1) blood cells or
humoral factors exchanged between ampullae at the tip-to-side junction
(2) mediators produced by-thesampullar pad cells involved in the
tip-to-side interaction.
Observation of damage to the receiving ampulla and evidence of
changes in vascular permeability during and after a rejection, reopens
the possibility of a role for blood cell or humoral factor exchange.
