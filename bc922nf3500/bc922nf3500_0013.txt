Rejection response in Botryllus oozooids
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1. A typical tip-to-side contact. The test cuticle fused
allowing the aggressing ampulla to enter into the test of
the neighboring oozooid and to form contact on the side of
a receiver ampulla. Note the static blood cells in the
aggressor's tip,

involving a loss of pad cells; no bleeding has occured. Note
the static blood cells in the aggressing ampullar tip. The
receiving ampulla remains uninjured and shows no obvious
response to the contact.
Figure 3. Aggressing ampulla showing a variation on the first degree
of response, involving damage to its pad cells and subsequent
bleeding. A necrotic area of dead blood and test cells is
present ar the site of injury.

involving an amputation of a prtion of its ampullar bulb.
The aggressing ampulla, receiving ampulla and adjacent ampullae
have withdrawn from the test cuticle, are clogged with static
blood cells, and are atrophied.

wall; note large amount of bleeding and necrotic zone. The
receiver and the other uninvolved ampullae show no response
to this quick and complete rejection.
