Oxygen Consumption and Oxygen Debt in
Cirolana harfordi
by Mark Anderson
Hopkins Marine Station
Introduction: The ability of the isopod Cirolana harfordi
to withstand prolonged periods of anoxia (W. Johnson, unpub.)
at normal activity levels suggests the presence of an efficient
facultative anaerobic metabolism. The study of oxygen
consumption and debt, when compared to declining oxygen
tension, leads to a knowledge of lactate production which
can be used to predict the nature of aerobic- anaerobic
switching setpoints, and to estimate the efficiency of the
metabolic pathway beyond lactate. Such knowledge, if later
compared with various substrate concentrations produced by
oxygen stress, should delineate the entire pathway.
I. Determination of anoxic capabilities and dependent variables.
Eight 30 ml. vials were filled with sea water and bubbled
with oil-pumped nitrogen gas for fifteen minutes. Three
other 30 ml. vials were treated as controls, and were analysed
by the Winkler Method for oxygen concentrations (1,2,3).
Four animals were then placed in each vial, and seven vials
were sealed, the eighth being a second control. Water temperature
was constant at 18 degrees C.; and record was kept of
survival time for each animal. (Table 1). The Winkler controls
showed an oxygen concentration of .24 ml. 0/liter, an anaerobic
environment according to Von Brand (4); and a second series of
