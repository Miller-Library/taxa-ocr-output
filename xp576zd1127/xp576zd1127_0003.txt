experiments a diffusion seal was made at the stopper with the
application of high-vacuum lubricant. The animals were all initially
placed in 1 liter of sea water filtered through Whatman GF/C
glass fiber filters; and, when indicated, antibiotics were added
in the following concentrations: Penicillin- 500 units/ml.,
and Streptomycin- .5 mg./ml. Care was taken to allow no gas
space or bubbles within the flask during experiments to avoid
adverse effects upon the probe and addition of oxygen in more
than saturation concemtrations to the flask. Probe accuracy was
assured by calibration against saturated seawater samples at
room temperature, and was checked against a Y.S.I. 451 meter
fitted with a +54 (temperature corrected) probe. Temperature of
the flask was at all times within one degree of 23 degrees C.,
measured with a 1/10 degree accuracy.
The first experiment was conducted with 50 male Cirolana,
whose total wet weight after was 5.0 grams; antibiotics were
used, resulting in a 98% survival rate; and no test was made
for oxygen debt. Initial tension was 19% Saturation, or 6.3 ppm.
or 4.5 ml. 0/liter. Final tension was 2% Saturation, time
elapsed to minimum 0,- tension was 12:30 hrs. The average O,-
consumption rate, derived as Net 0, change, was .315 ml. 0,/L/hr.,

or .063 ml. 0/gm./hr. (Graph #1).
The second experiment was done with 50 male Cirolana, total
wet weight of 2.6 grams; antibiotics were not used, resulting
in a 30% survival rate; and oxygen debt was tested by allowing
the isopods to remain at minimum oxygen for 6 hours before sub-
