Song of the Sea
dedicated to the Hopkins Marine Station
I. The Soul of Oceans
Suspect the truth, ignore the found:
These men were made to walk the ground;
And though their eyes were made to see,
The soul was never meant to be
Of ocean sizes, nor as free.
The soul of oceans dry men see
Is fitting to the hazy sky
As though we were horizon- bound
To all her shifting symmetry
In answering our salty "Why ?"
The honest need behind our reach
Is conquest, wet and dry
The sky, the sea, and all the breach
Between small night and day
Will offer but a small delay
In knowing what's behind the eye.
