1) the relative amounts of lactate and succinate formed at dif-
ferent oxygen tensions, hopefully indicating the aerobic-
enaerobic switching setpoint and the extent to which the anaero-
bicpathway is developed in Cirolana harfordi;
2)sex and size dependence upon oxygen consumption- oxygen
tension relationships;
3) the extent of oxygen debt for each class;
4) whether incompletely -oxidized substrates are excreted into
surrounding water; and
5) what advantages anaerobiosis holds for Cirolana in a
natural environment.
