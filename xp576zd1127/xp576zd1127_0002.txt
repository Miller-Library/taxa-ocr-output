Winkler tests were performed upon three of the closed vial
water samples at the end of the experiment, showing concen-
trations of .019 ml. 0/liter.
The earliest death of all the animals in vial f8, the
control, led to a second experiment in which all vials were
left open to the air, none of them having been treated with
nitrogen. pH readings were taken approximately every three
hours with indicator paper, and no variance from the initial
value of 6.5 was recorded. (Table 2). A visual analysis of
microorganisms found in three typical vials is given in
Table 3, based upon a week of incubation, and it was concluded
that the death of whole vials was due to bacterial action.
The result of the first experiment indicated the susceptibility
of brooding females to death by oxygen stress, thereby furnish-
ing bacteria with organic matter necessary for large population
growth. These results were verified in later experiments.
and tend to disqualify respiration studies done by other
researchers without proper antibiotic control.
II. Determination of oxygen curves.
Oxygen concentrations were measured with a Yellow Springs
Instrument Co. #53 meter and probe in connection with a
Beckman 1005 10" Chart Recorder. Both the probe and a
thermometer were fitted into the rubber stopper of a 1 liter
Erlenmeyer flask; isopods were contained in a small cage of
plastic screen, suspended by nylon fishline above the stirring
flea(required for good ventilation of the probe); and during
