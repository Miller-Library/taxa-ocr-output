Proposal: A Study of Anaerobiosis in Cirolana harfordi
Introduction:
It has been recently proposed (22,32,21) that certain
anaerobic metabolic pathways are far more energetically proÂ¬
ductive than initially assumed, yielding as many as thirteen
moles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per mole of glucose
in comparison with the two moles of ATP liberated by incomplete
oxidation of glucose to lactate.(see figure on p. 2)
Indications of such a pathway have also been found in human
muscle and in several diving vertebrates (21). Each basic
point of this intriguing pathway has been investigated by
other researchers, using techniques which range from pulse-
labeling (36,3) to competetive - enzyme activity ratios (8,10)
to quantitative substrate assays (20, 15).
The basic points of the pathway, with support as indicated,
are the following:
1) The aerobic- anaerobic branchpoint is located at phospho-
enol pyruvate (PEP) (37, 14);
2) Negative feedback exists between the two PEP branchings
(37);
3)Glutamate and other amino acids serve as redox substrates
(37, 14, 18, 1);
4) Lactate may be converted preferentially into succinate
(23,33,17,29,5,9,16,19,38,26);
