nutrients for accelerated bacterial growth. Such deaths in
Cirolana are usually brooding females, who have a lower stress
tolerance; this is most likely due to the abstinence from feeding
in brooding females (W. Johnson, dissertation thesis) and the
subsequent lack of amino reserves required for anaerobic metabo-
lism (5,6,7). Concentratinns of 500units Penicillin/ml. and
.5gm. Streptomycin/ml. raise survival rates over 24 hours of
continual 0,- stress from 30% to 94-98%.
2. Cirolana harfordi develops an oxygen debt if allowed to
reduce O2- tension from saturation to 1-2% Saturation, and
this debt leads to a consumption rate of 1.38 x the original
rate when the animals are kept at their minimum 0,- tensian
for six hours.
3. Oxygen saturation levels of 1-2% are effectively anoxic for
Cirolana harfordi, as the animal seems physiologically incapable
of reducing O2- tension below this value.
4. Wet weights on Cirolana are repeatable without blotting,and
are more representative of the amount of respirational tissue
than are dry weights, which are primarily derived from chiton.
5. Cirolana harfordi seems to have an efficient anaerobic metabolic
pathway: survival of O- stress and anoxia is nearly 100% over
24 hours when bacteria are removed from test water; the oxygen
tension curves reveal no attempt by the animal to slow aerobic
respiration with decreasing oxygen tensions, although activity
continues at a normal rate even at 0- levels of zero.
6. The switchpoint for aerobic-anaerobic conversion must occur
before Cirolana reaches zero oxygen tension, due to the energy
