5) Succinate may be converted into propionate (25,20).
The ability of Ascaris lumbricoides to metabolize to
propionate (35), in conjunction with Hochachka's findings in
vertebrate muscle (21) and known anaerobiosis in such crustacea
as barnacles (30,31,27), ostracods (28) and isopods (2,7)--
not to mention coelenterates (34), echinoderms (6), and molluscs
(29,24,32)--suggests that something similar to the newly-proposed
pathway might be found in the isopod Cirolana harfordi. Having
done several experiments, I can offer the following results:
1) The population taken from holdfasts of the kelp Macrocystis
pyrifera in the sheltered Great Tide Pool, Pacific Grove, had
a median survival time (LTgo) of 21 hours at 18 degrees C.;
2) The maximum survival time was 42 hours, and could probably
be lengthened in closed-vial tests through the use of antibiotics;
3)brooding females are less resistant to anoxia than males;
4)pH does not change by more than.5 during exposure to anoxic
conditions;
5)activity remains high even at O2 concentrations of.O19
ml. Oo/liter H.O (anaerobic conditions, according to von Brand,
1946) as determined by the Winkler method (11,12,13). It is also
known that C. harfordi develop an oxygen debt which is repaid
after anoxia (W. Johnsan, unpub.), although the extent of the debt
and the nature of the substrate are unknown.
Method:
After segregation by sex and weight, C. harfordi specifens
will be placed in a sealed flask, stoppered with a Y.S.I.754
