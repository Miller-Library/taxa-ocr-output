oxygen probe (equipped for temperature measurement). The flask
is to contain water at equilibrium with the air; and oxygen
consumption ys. time and oxygen consumption vs. oxygen tension
graphs will be obtained for each sex and size group. After twelve
hours at zero oxygen tension, all vials will again be saturated
with air, and oxygen debts determined.
Subsequently subjecting the a imals by the same sex-size
relationships to the conditions denoted above, the vials will be
opened at regular intervals, the animals withdrawn and fixed accor-
ding to (Wollenberger,et.al.,1960) in liquid nitrogen. Assays
for lactate (after Wieland, 1928) and succinate (after Bergmeyer,
1965) will be made, and graphs of lactate and succinate concentration
ys. oxygen tension will be generated.
Water in the vials will also be assayed, as bivalve molluscs,
brachiopods (18) and cirripeds (27) are known to excrete incompletely
oxidized substrates.
As a final verification of the relevance of anaerobic studies
on Cirolana, microhabitat oxygen tension studies will be conducted
1) under intertidal rocks north of Agassiz Beach at Hopkins Marine
Station, where there are large communities of Cirolana harfordi;
and 2) inside kelp holdfasts of Macrocystis. An attempt will be
made to correlate Cirolana's anaerobic capability with such
behavioral aspects as clumping and response to surf action.
