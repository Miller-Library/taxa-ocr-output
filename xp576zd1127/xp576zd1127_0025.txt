Song of the Sea
II.
The heavy- slinging, singing sea
In wandering skim of wind- soaked breath
Cries out her stone- high waveborne plea
In whispered warning- key of death;
And gulls in flocks, in circles, flew
The bordered blue above unfree,
While dogs in packs, in shore- lines, knew
The breaking fear of land- lined sea;
Cormorants, in their sullen glow,
Hoarded misting drops of sound;
And on the battled rocks below
The soldiered waves were foaming ground.
Above the surf, the garnered shore,
Below the circling, seeking birds
The sightless song of sea resurged
In magnitudes beneath, before:
"Make the stone to do the work
For sea; and weep, not tear;
Make fumbled rock to waste her hope
On bitter song-
Her utter strength on brute despair;
