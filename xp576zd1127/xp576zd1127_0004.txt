stituting oxygen- saturated water for the oxygen-depleted
water, a process which took approximately one minute. (Graph 42).
For the first oxygen tension curve, initial tension was 177,
or 5.6 ppm, or 4.0 ml. 02/liter. Final tension was 1% Saturation,
time elapsed to oxygen minimum was 10:30 hours. The average
O2- consumption rate was .36 ml./L/hr., or .138 ml. O/gm./hr.
Initial tension for the Op- debt was 18% Saturation, or
6ppm, or 4.3 ml. 02/liter. Final tension was 1% Saturation,
time elapsed to oxygen minimum was 6:18 hrs. The average O,
consumption rate was .63 ml. 02/L/hr., or, due to the mortalities
during debt measurement, from .24 ml. O/gm./hr. to .8 ml. Op/gm./hr.
The third respiration experiment was done with 50 male Cirolana,
total wet weight of 2.5 grams; antibiotics were used, resulting in
a 94% survival rate; and oxygen debt was tested as in the previous
experiment. For the first oxygen tension curve, initial tension
was 16% Saturation, or 5.3 ppm, or 3.8 ml. Op/liter. Final tension
was 2.5% Saturation, time elapsed to minimum oxygen tension was
16:10 hours. The average Op- cnnsumption rate was .196 ml. 02/L/hr.,
or .08 ml. 0/gm./hr.
Initial tension for the O2- debt was 17% Saturation, or 5.6 ppm,
or 4.0 ml. 0,/liter. Final tension was 2.5% Saturation, time elapsed
to oxygen minimum was 12:42 hours. The average Op- consumption rate
was .266 ml. 02/L/hr., or from.106 ml. O/gm./hr. to .113 ml.O/gm/hr.
(range predicated upon mortalities during debt measurement).
(Graph 43).
Because of the large discrepancy in initial rates and debts
between Graphs 2 and 3, oxygen was monitored in an unfiltered
sea water sample fram the Cirolana aquarium, with no isopods in
