colonies not only are able to discriminate between related and unrelated neighbors,
but can fuse with histocompatible partners to form chimeric colonies with a contin¬
uous circulatory system. It has been suggested that since nutrients, and also primor¬
dial germ cells, can be translocated through the circulatory system, this adaptation
may allow Botryllus invading new territory to cooperate with relatives in compet¬
ing for space against unrelated colonies (Grosberg 1987). When two related colonies
fused, each would effectively increases the space it occupied by a function of the de-
gree of genetic identity between the partners in the chimera.
I studied the relationship between colony relatedness and distance between
colonies using two different methods. One the one hand, I used arbitrarily-primed
PCR to identify DNA markers which could allow one to determine the relative ge¬
netic similarity of separate colonies. On the other hand, I set up assays to test the
frequency of fusion between the offspring of neighboring colonies and offspring of
non-neighboring colonies within the same general area. My goal was to find out
whether near-neighbor colonies were more genetically similar than colonies distant
from each other in the same population and colonies from populations separated by
significant physical barriers. I hoped to confirm the results of earlier studies show¬
ing that pockets of inbreeding did exist within certain Botryllus populations
(Grosberg 1987), and to break new ground in the application of genetic fingerprinting
techniques to the species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Biology of Botryllus schlosseri: Botryllus schlosseri is a common colonial as
cidian present throughout the northern hemisphere. It occurs in harbor fouling
communities and other habitats characterized by relatively low water flow rates and
constant immersion. In the Monterey marina, Botryllus colonizes algae and larger
