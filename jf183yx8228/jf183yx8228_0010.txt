Figure 1: Lanes 1,3: molecular weight
markers. Lanes 6, 9, 12, 15, 18: DNA
sample isolated from a colony collected
at Bodega Bay. Lanes 7, 10, 13, 16, 19:
collected at Santa Cruz. Lanes 5, 8, 11,
14, 17: control lanes; no genomic DNA in
reaction mixture.
Five different primers were used as
indicated.
Figure 2: IdNTPsl = 100 uM Throughout.
Lane 1: Molecular weight markers
(lambda HindIII). Concentrations of
magnesium, DNA, and Taq polymerase
varied; two different primers and two
different DNAs used. Note indistinct
banding as compared to figure 1.
