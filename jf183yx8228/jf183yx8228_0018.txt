ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 would like to thank Simona Bartl for giving so generously of her time and
of her expertise. Without her help and encouragement, which went above and be¬
yond the call of duty, this project would have been impossible for me to plan, let
alone carry out. I would also like to thank Kathi Ishizuka and Karla Pateri, who
gave me generous and patient assistance with my work on live Botryllus. Nanette
Chadwick gave invaluable assistance with the design of my Botryllus oozooid exper
iments and with statistical analysis. The entire Powers lab at Hopkins Marine sta¬
tion deserves my gratitude for putting up with my questions and difficulties.
Finally, thanks are due to my adviser Dennis Powers, who was willing to put a
rather complex and difficult project into the hands of a completely untried under¬
graduate and saw to it that I was never lacking for guidance.
