The colonies collected from the wild were tied to glass slides, placed in slide racks,
and maintained in running raw seawater aquaria. Oozooids were collected from
parent colonies by placing blank glass slides (settlement slides) in the racks approxi¬
mately 2.5 cm from the parent colony. Most of the larvae which hatched from the
parent colonies settled on these slides shortly after release. Settlement slides were
removed to another running raw seawater tank, then cleaned and transferred to
standing filtered seawater prior to being used in the experiment.
The oozooids collected were allowed to grow for 7-21 days and were set up in
pairs on fresh slides to test for fusibility. Oozooids were removed from settlement
slides by carefully scraping them off with a piece of razor blade, picked up in a drop¬
per and placed on a fresh slide, then checked to make sure they were right side up;
excess water was removed with a piece of tissue. The paired oozooids were placed
Imm or less apart, one to three pairs per slide. The transplanted oozooids were then
either placed in a moisture chamber for 3-5 min or placed immediately in standing
seawater. Äfter 5-10 days, pairs were scored for fusion or non-fusion.
The oozooids used for these experiments were obtained from 12 separate par-
ent colonies obtained from the field. Four pairs of parent colonies were neighbors
(collected «10 cm apart), and four pairs were non-neighbors (collected »3m apart).
Eight different colonies were used for the neighbor pairs; two of these colonies were
also used as parents for the non-neighbor pairs, along with six other colonies. From
each pair of parents, 20 pairs of oozooids were set up, for a total of 160 pairs of
oozooids. Because some of the oozooids did not adhere well to their slides, died
after transfer, or did not make tunic-to-tunic contact during the period of my obser¬
vations, sample sizes are smaller than the total number of oozooid pairs originally
set up.
