ABSTRACT
Many sessile marine invertebrates exhibit a common suite of adaptations, in¬
cluding life histories with both a sexual and an asexual phase, clonality and/or colo¬
niality, and the ability to distinguish between clonemates and non-clonemates.
These characteristics, together with limited, or philopatric, dispersal patterns in free-
swimming larvae, are all present in the common tunicate Botryllus schlosseri. This
organism presents an ideal model for the study of the problems in population genet¬
ics posed by complex life cycles, because the genetics of its fusion-rejection reaction
are well-understood, and it is relatively easy to collect and maintain in the labora¬
tory. I present here the results of experiments using both histocompatibility tests on
live Botryllus oozooids in the laboratory, and arbitrarily-primed PCR, as tools for
population genetics research. My work with Botryllus oozooids involved testing
the rates of fusion and non-fusion between pairs of offspring obtained from wild
colonies containing fertilized eggs. I compared fusibility rates for the offspring of
near-neighbor colonies to those for offspring of non-neighboring colonies, and
found that there was a significantly higher rate of fusion between offspring of
neighbors than between offspring of non-neighbors. My work with arbitrarily¬
primed PCR was aimed at developing the technique for further work in Botryllus;
was able to detect genetic diversity based on differences in the patterns of amplifica¬
tion products obtained with different DNA samples. I also describe some prelimi¬
nary conclusions as to the most effective conditions for arbitrarily-primed PCR reac¬
tions using Botryllus DNAS.
INTRODUCTION
Many types of organisms, both plant and animal, are characterized by life cy-
cles including fixed adult phases, which grow asexually, and mobile, sexually pro¬
duced propagules. Specifically, this type of life history is common among sessile
