phenol:CHCl3: isoamyl alcohol (25: 4.8: 0.2, v/v), once with phenol: CHClz: isoamyl
alcohol (25: 24: 1, v/v), and once with CHCl3: isoamyl alcohol (24: 1, v/v). Nucleic
acids were precipitated with 0. 1 vol. 2M sodium acetate and 2 vol. ethanol and
spooled immediately with a sterile Pasteur pipette, then resuspended in 1 to 3 ml of
TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 10 mM EDTA). RNA was removed by incubation
with DNase-free RNase A (50 ug/ml at 37° C for »2 hours). Samples were then ex¬
tracted twice with phenol: CHClz: isoamyl alcohol (25: 24: 1, v/v) and twice with 1
vol anhydrous ether. The DNA was again precipitated with 0. 1 vol 2M sodium ac
etate and 2 vol ethanol, spooled with sterile Pasteur pipettes, washed in 70%
ethanol, and resuspended in 1 ml TE (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA). DNA
concentrations and purity were determined by reading absorbances at 260 and 280
nm, and by electrophoresis on 0.8 % agarose gels (after Kumar et al., 1988 with modi¬
fications of Simona Bartl, pers. comm.).
Amplification conditions: Amplification reactions were performed in vol¬
umes of 25 ul containing 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl, 200 uM
each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Pharmacia), 15 ng primer, 25 ng of genomic
DNA, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus). DNA was dena¬
tured at 94° C for approximately 5 min before amplification. Amplification was per¬
formed in a Perkin-Elmer/Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler programmed for 30 cycles of
1 min at 94°, 1 min at 36°, and 3 min at 72°, using the fastest available transitions be¬
tween each temperature. Amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis
in 1.4% agarose gels and detected by staining with ethidium bromide.
Histocompatibility Assays
Colonies of Botryllus schlosseri were collected in the Monterey marina;
colonies were generally found growing on algae under the sides of the floating
docks. Neighboring colonies were collected within 0-10 cm of each other along a
horizontal transect. Non-neighboring colonies were collected at least 3 m apart.
