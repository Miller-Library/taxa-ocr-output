RESULTS
Arbitrary Primer Experiments
Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment in which five primers were
screened for amplification of segments of genomic DNA from two different
Botryllus samples, one taken from Bodega Bay and one from the Santa Cruz marina.
For some of the primers, most of the bands which were amplified from one sample
were also amplified from the other, but for other primers several bands were pro¬
duced for one sample and none for the other. A total of 37 different bands were de¬
tected. All primers were also used in control reactions without genomic DNA; no
primer artefacts were observed. Thus, it would appear that genetic differences can be
distinguished using this technique. Ten other primers (data not shown) were also
screened before these results were obtained; none gave any significant amplification
products.
After obtaining preliminary positive results, the next step was to refine the
protocol to obtain sharper banding patterns and to test for reproducibility by repeat¬
ing the same amplification reactions. Williams et al. (1990) used a dNTP concentra¬
tion of 100 uM instead of 200 uM; the higher concentration was used by Welsh and
McClelland (1990). Williams et al. (1990) also recommended reducing the concen-
tration of either genomic DNA or polymerase in order to resolve a non-specific
"smear" of amplification products into distinct bands. Figure 2 shows the amplifica¬
tion products of reactions were carried out using 100 uM dNTPs and varying con¬
centrations of DNA, MgCl, and Taq polymerase. The lower dNTP concentration
produced much fewer bands than the higher concentration used at first.
Welsh and McClelland, who used longer primers originally designed for
other purposes, employed a similar temperature profile to the one described above,
but ran the reactions for 45 cycles. Thus PCRs were allowed to run for 45 cycles of
the standard temperature profile rather than 30 (see figure 3); this gave more ampli¬
