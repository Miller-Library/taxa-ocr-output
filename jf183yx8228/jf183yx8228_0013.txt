ferent pairs of parents (p«0.001), as did those for the offspring of non-neighboring
parents (p20.001). My pooled data for all pairs of oozooids from neighboring parents
and for all pairs from non-neighbors are compared in Figure 7. The frequency of fu¬
sion for offspring of neighbors varied significantly from the frequency of fusion be¬
tween offspring of non-neighbors, according to the G-test of independence (p«0.001)
(Sokal and Rohlf 1981a, b).
