The greatest overlap between the populations occurs between the 3.0
and 4.0 foot tidal levels. Laboratory experiments in aquaria with
artificial tides demonstrate a similar partitioning.
Juveniles of both species appear to be mainly relatively nonÂ¬
selective detritivores. Young Littorina scutulata consume more green
algae and diatoms, but this may reflect incidental ingestion of
epiphytes. While the two species consume roughly the same food,
they obtain it in different places, somcompetition appears slight.
