Two snails abundant on rocky shores in the midtide zone along
the California coast are Tegula funebralis A. Adams 1853 and Littorina
scutulata Gould 1849. Their large size, numbers, and easy avail-
ability have made the adults of T. funebralis attractive to research-
ers, and much work has been done on them (see various papers in The
Veliger, volume 6 (supplement) 1964, and Abbott and Haderlie, 1979).
The juveniles of T. funebralis have received comparatively little
study. Littorina scutulata has also received attention from previ-
ous researchers (see Abbott and Haderlie, 1979), and more is known
of the earlier developmental stages here, but many aspects of the
natural history are still incompletely known.
No previous studies have focused primarily on the juveniles
of either species, particularily on their relationship to one an¬
other in the middle intertidal zone community dominated by the red
algae Gigartina papillata (C./Agardh) J. Agardh 1846 and Rhodoglossum
affine (Harvey) Kylin 1928. The food web of this midtide "forest
is complex, and the competitive interactions between two species
of herbivorous gastropods are difficult to demonstrate. However,
a study of the distribution, activity patterns, and food habits of
the juveniles of Tegula funebralis and Littorina scutulata does re¬
veal a great deal concerning the manner in which resources are par¬
titioned between them.
Distribution and Movements
Juvenile snails of both species were more or less arbitrarily
defined as those individuals measuring 4 mm or less in maximum
