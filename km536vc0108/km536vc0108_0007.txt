high tide in the dark is contrary to the general trend. Most of
these snails, however, were active on the rock surface, and were
observed moving up the rock. The L. scutulata juveniles showed
a slight tendency to move downward on the rock during daylight
falling tides. Snails of both species were observed moving away
from direct sunlight when completely submerged during a daylight
high tide.
Examination of the data with respect to the specific sub¬
strates on which the animals were found showed other significant
relationships. Littorina scutulata juveniles tended to remain
on Gigartina papillata, moving to the tips of fronds when covered
by water, while young Tegula funebralis were observed predomi-
nantly on the rock surface, retreating to the crevice, rock bot-
tom and G. papillata holdfasts at low tide.
The separation observed under laboratory conditions corre¬
lates well with data on zonation and subhabitat partitioning pre¬
sented in Figure 1. The trend towards occupation of a higher zone
by young Littorina scutulata and a lower zone by Tegula fune¬
bralis juveniles remains despite compression of the six foot ver¬
tical range observed in the field into a 15 cm range in the lab¬
oratory tank.
The differences in the habitats of the two species observed
in the field at low tide persist through the tidal cycle; Tegula
funebralis juveniles continue to be found mainly on the rock sur-
face and Gigartina papillata holdfasts, and young Littorina scu¬
tulata predominate on the G. papillata fronds. This continued
occupancy of distinct subhabitats supports the idea of a real re¬
