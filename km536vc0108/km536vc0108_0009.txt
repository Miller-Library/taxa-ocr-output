(defined as organic material of unidentifiable origin), green algae,
dinoflagellates, and other (miscellaneous).
After proficiency in the recognition of these catogories was
established, the stomach contents of ten individuals of each species
were scanned critically. Relative abundance of the different con¬
stituents, as a percentage of the total biomass of the contents,
was visually estimated.
Figure 4 shows the means and ranges of the catogories for the
gut contents of the two species. Both contained a high percentage
of detritus. Littorina scutulata juveniles contained more green
algae and diatoms than did juvenile Tegula funebralis, and the latter
showed many small brown dinoflagellates lacking in the gut of L.
scutulata. A few cells from encrusting red algae, and an occasional
foraminiferan were found in the stomachs of small T. funebralis.
The high concentration of detritus in the stomachs contents of
both species suggests that both feed in a similar and relatively
non-selective manner. The higher percentage of green algae and diatoms
consumed by young Littorina scutulata may possibly represent inci¬
dental ingestion of epiphytes, for these are found on the macroalgal
fronds frequented by the snails. Isaw no evidence of feeding on
any of the larger macroalgae, such as Gigartina papillata or Rhodoglossum
affine.
Comparison of my results with the findings of Best (1964) on
the food habits of adult Tegula funebralis indicate that the diets
of adults and juveniles are quite different. Best found the adults
fed on a variety of macroalgae and microalgae, with detritus contrib¬
