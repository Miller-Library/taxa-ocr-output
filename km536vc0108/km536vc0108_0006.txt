To increase contrast between snails and background, the exper-
imental animals were marked with fingernail polish, a different
color being used for each species. Twenty marked juveniles of each
species were selected, placed on top of the rock in the aquarium,
and allowed to move about and acclimate for 24 hours. Thereafter,
observations were made at two hour intervals over a 24 hour tidal
cycle. The number of snails in each vertical zone on the rock (high,
medium, low) and on each type of substrate (Gigartina papillata
fronds, the lower frond/holdfast area, the rock surface, or the
rock crevice) were recorded for each species at every reading. To
avoid disturbing the animals, a dim red light was used to make ob¬
servations at night. Later, the same experiment was repeated, but
with the tidal clock shifted by six hours, and the tidal regime start¬
ed 24 hours before records of movement began. This yielded data
under a different relationship of the diurnal and tidal cycles.
The results are shown in Figure 3. As regards vertical zo¬
nation on the rock, the Littorina scutulata population was found
to occur higher than the Tegula funebralis population under all
conditions of light and tide. The greatest overlap between the
populations occurred on the middle region of the rock. The
T. funebralis juveniles, however, displayed greater vertical
mobility. Individuals often moved to the high surface of the
rock as the water rose, and returned to the lower regions as it
fell. When the receding tide occurred at night, fewer snails
moved down, and as a result were left high on the rock at the mor-
ning low tide. The large number of Tegula low on the rock at
