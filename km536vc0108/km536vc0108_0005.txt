Activity
Although it was not difficult to establish the subhabitat
partitioning in the low tide distribution of juvenile Tegula funebralis
and Littorina scutulata, it was desirable to supplement this with
information on activity and movements of the animals, and on their
distribution at high tide. Even in a region of moderate surf, it
proved difficult to observe the positions and movements of 4 mm snails
in the field over complete tidal cycles.
The following experiments were peformed under laboratory con¬
ditions. In an aquarium provided with a constant inflow of seawater
at 14-15° C, a clock was used to control water level. The tip of
the outflow hose of the aquarium was attached to a rod extending
from the hour hand of the clock (Figure 2). The twelve hour period
of the clock gave two "high", and two "low" tides in 24 hours, ap¬
proximating the natural tidal cycle.
To simulate the natural habitat, a rock was collected from the
intertidalin an area common to both species, and placed in the
aquarium. This rock could be visually divided into three zones
(high, medium, and low) each forming a belt 5 cm wide and each with
approximately the same proportion of Gigartina papillata and bare
surface. A vertical crevice ran down one side of the rock. The
connection of the clock to the outflow hose was adjusted so that the
artificial tide covered the rock completely at high water and exposed
it completely at low water. A skylight in the laboratory provided
a natural lighting regime.
