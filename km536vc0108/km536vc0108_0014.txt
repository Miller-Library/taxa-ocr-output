Figure 2: The setup used to simulate tidal conditions inthe lab.
Hour hand of clock (A) raises and lowers outflow hose of aquarium (B)
as the time changes. Seawater inflow into tank (C) is constant.
Rock simulating natural habitat (D) and its supporting stand (E).
Figure 3: Vertical position and substrate of juvenile Tegula funebralis
and Littorina scutulata under different conditions of light and tide
in laboratory aquaria. The percent of the populatios observed on
the different substrates and positions of snails on the rock are in¬
dicated in the bars. Horizontal rows are arranged in order of great¬
est number of snails on high zone of rock at high tide. The arrows
refer to the predominant movement of the populations during the two
readings previous to each condition, the left hand arrow in each
righ
column refering to T. funebralis, the left to L. scutulata. Where
no arrow appears, vertical shifts in the populations of snails ap¬
proached zero. With respect to vertical position, the midline rep¬
resents the middle of the rock The midline in the substrate columns
divides snails on Gigartina papillata (above the line) from those
on rock substrates.

as percentage of the total biomass of stomach contents. Results shown
are averages based on ten snails, with the ranges given in parentheses.
