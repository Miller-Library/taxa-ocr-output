additional information. Juvenile Tegula funebralis were often found
in tidepools along with adults, but they were commonly on the under¬
sides of rocks in the pools — areas where the larger adults cuuld
not take refuge. As Tegula grow larger they assume the adult habit,
and specimens over 6 mm routinely occur in the same crevices as the
larger animals.
The studies of Chow (1975), on the vertical distribution of the
Littorina scutulata population at Bodega Head showed that individual
size tends to increase with increasing vertical height in the inter¬
tidal zone. Juvenile (1-4 mm) snails, however, were noted to occur
over the entire vertical range. Both the vertical range of the pop¬
ulation (3.0-12.0 feet above MLLW) and vertical position of the peak
in population density (6.2 feet) in Chow's study site were higher
than those observed at Mussel Point. The difference in distribution
is probably related to differences in degree of wave action; the
earlier work reflects distribution on an exposed coast where wave
action extends zonation vertically, whereas the study sites selected
at Mussel Point were relatively protected from strong surf.
Even where Tegula funebralis and Littorina scutulata juveniles
occur in the same area, the observed substrate preferences tend to
place them in distinct subhabitats. For example, in the present
study, on any particular Rhodoglossum affine plant the small L.
scutulata are more commonly found on the fronds, while young T.
funebralis more often inhabit the sandy holdfast. Thus, subhabitat
partitioning and zonation sharply limit the possible interactions
between juveniles of the two species.
