source partitioning between juveniles of the two species.
Daniels (1978) studied the activity patterns and movements of
adult Tegula funebralis under field and laboratory conditions. He
found that population movement corresponded to the tidal cycle.
However, in the absence of tidal fluctuations (as in outdoor aquaria
kept continuously full of water) movement occured according to a
diel cycle, with the animals moving up rock surfaces at night, and
down to shaded areas in the day. He also observed adult T. funebralis
occasionally left high and dry in the field after a receeding tide
at night, and concluded that light somehow reinforces the downward
response of the animals. The results of the present study indicate
that juvenile T. funebralis generally show these same tendencies,
but the phototaxic responses of both adults and juveniles need fur¬
ther investigation.
Food Habit
Juvenile snails of both species were collected from the field.
The substrate on which they were found was noted, and the animals
were immediately preserved in 102formalin. Most collections were
made in the early morning hours, with the animals still wet from
the previous high tide. The stomachs of the animals were full.
The shells were removed, and the stomachs excised under a dis¬
secting microscope. The gut contents were sepérated from tissue,
mounted on glass slides in glycerol, and examined at 400 X. Dr.
Isabella A. Abbott and Mr. William Magruder, both of the Hopkins
Marine Station, assisted in the identification of possible food items.
Gut contents were grouped into five general catogories; detritus
