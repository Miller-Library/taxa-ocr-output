The areas sampled showed consistent trends, justifying the pool¬
ing of results. Data from all four transects are shown together in
Figure 1. With respect to vertical zonation, juvenile Tegula funebralis
occured predominantly below the 4 foot level above MLLW, while juv¬
enile Littorina scutulata were found mainly above the 3 foot level.
The greatest overlap of the two populations occured 3-4 feet above
MLLW. Plotting the distribution according to nature of the specific
habitat and substrate where the snails were found reveals another
important trend..Young Tegula funebralis occur chiefly in sandy hold¬
fasts of the common macroalgae and in rocky crevices, while Littorina
scutulata are more frequently on the fronds of macroalgae and in
empty barnacle shells.
The data on small Tegula funebralis complement existing inform¬
ation on the distribution of the species. Wara and Wright (1964),
working with the occurence at lowtide of specimens over 13 mm in
length, found that the population density decreased as the amount
of algal cover on the substrate increased. A decrease in the mean
size of the animals with increasing tidal height was also noted.
In the present study the adults were found lower down and on relativ¬
ely bare rock surfaces, whereas the juveniles occured in the sandy
holdfasts of macroalgae. This seperation should tend to reduce the
level of competitive interactions between different stages in the
life history, probably important in a species in which adults may
live as long as 30 years (Darby, 1964).
Qualitative observations made during the present study revealed
