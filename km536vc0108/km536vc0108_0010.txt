uting little bulk. The amount of detritus consumed by juveniles in
the present study again suggests a partitioning of resources between
different stages in the life history.
The investigations of Dahl (1964) and Foster (1964) on the
microscopic and macroscopic food sources of Littorina scutulata
show that macroalgae, particularily Pelvetia fastigiata Setchell
and Gardner 1917 and Cladaphora trichotoma (C. A. Agardh) Kützing,
were prefered food sources of snails in the laboratory, although
green algae and diatoms contribute significantly. No indication of
feeding on detritus was noted, however, the stomach contents of
animals freshly collected from the field were not examined. Just
as in Tegula funebralis, this difference in food habits between juv-
eniles and adults may enable larger populations to be supported.
Despite the similarity of the gut contents in juveniles of
Tegula funebralis and Littorina scutulata, it appears likely that
there is little competition for food resources between the two species.
Both field and laboratory studies indicate that they forage in rel¬
atively distinct subhabitats.
Summary
Field studies of distribution of juveniles (4 mm or less in
greatest shell dimension) of Tegula funebralis and Littorina scutulata
indicate they occupy largely sepérate subhabitats. T. funebralis
juveniles occur predominantly in the sandy holdfasts of macroalgae
and in rock crevices, less than 4.0 feet above mean lower low water.
Littorina scutulata juveniles are found mainly on the fronds of macro¬
algae and in empty barnacle shells more than 3.0 feet above MLLW.
