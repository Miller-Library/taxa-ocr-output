glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Such processing, however, requires energy that may not be
available during hypoxia, and it would seem counter-productive to burn glycogen and
subsequently spend energy rebuilding storage substrates while still under hypoxic stress.
This study, therefore, illustrates at least two strategies that G. mirabilis may employ in
response to hypoxic stress. First, I conclude that under hypoxic conditions, G. mirabilis rely on
glycolysis for ATP production, and supply the necessary substrates for glycolytic flux by
depleting liver glycogen stores and shuttling them as glucose to other tissues. Second, G.
mirabilis may metabolically suppress the liver so that it consumes less ATP and produces less
lactate than other tissues. These strategies are a clear example of a complex systemic response to
environmental hypoxia, one that integrates the needs and responses of different tissues into a
unified strategy for the whole organism's survival.
