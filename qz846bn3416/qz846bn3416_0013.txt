Figure 1. Critical oxygen concentration (Pqu) for three Gillichthys mirabilis. Pait is taken as the
oxygen concentration below which the fish begin to lose their ability to draw oxygen
from their surroundings (here an upward slope). All three fish have a Peri of 1.0 mg/L.
This value was used to determine the experimental oxygen concentration (0.8 mg/L).
Figure 2. Lactate and glycogen concentrations in white muscle of fish exposed to 0, 8, 24, and
72 hours of 0.8 mg O/L hypoxia. Error bars represent onestandard deviation from the
mean of each time-point. (*) mark significant changes from control (O hours).
Significance was determined using a standard one-way ANOVA (p.001) with a
Tukey's test (HSD = 0.54). Sample sizes are given in parenthesis on the x-axis.
Figure 3. Lactate and glycogen concentrations in heart of fish exposed to 0, 8, 24, and 72 hours
of 0.8 mg O/L hypoxia. Error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean.
*) mark significant changes from control (0 hours). (**) mark significant changes
from 8 hours. Significance was determined using a standard one-way ANOVA
(pS.001) and a Tukey's test (HSD = 0.58). Sample sizes are given in parentheses on the
X-axis.
Figure 4. Lactate and glycogen concentrations in brain of fish exposed to 0, 8, 24, and 72 hours
of 0.8 mg O/L hypoxia. Error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean.
(*) mark significant changes from control (0 hours). (**) mark significant changes
from 8 hours. Significance was determined using a standard one-way ANOVA
(pS.001) and a Tukey's test (HSD = 0.52). Sample sizes are given in parentheses on the
X-axis.
Figure 5. Lactate and glycogen concentrations in liver of fish exposed to 0, 8, 24, and 72 hours
of 0.8 mg O/L hypoxia. Error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean
(*) mark significant changes from control (0 hours). (**) mark significant changes
from 8 hours. Significance was determined using a standard one-way ANOVA (p..001
for lactate; p5.0001 for glycogen) and a Tukey's test (HSD - 0.31 for lactate; HSD-
2.87 for glycogen). Sample sizes are given in parentheses on the x-axis.
Figure 6. Glycogen concentrations in liver, heart, white muscle, and brain of fish exposed to 0,
8, 24, and 72 hours of 0.8 mg O/L hypoxia. Error bars represent one standard
deviation from the mean. Glycogen concentration changes significantly only in liver.
Figure 7. Lactate concentrations in liver, heart, white muscle and brain of fish exposed to 0, 8,
24, and 72 hours of 0.8 mgO/L hypoxia. Error bars represent one standard deviation
from the mean. Lactate accumulates significantly in all tissues throughout the timeÂ¬
course.
