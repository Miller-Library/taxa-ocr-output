Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Shell Cleaning
As a test for the role of the flap in shell cleaning, I left snails with and without flaps in
unfiltered sea water for approximately one week, and then checked for fouling by algae or
diatom growth. I also took 12 hours of time lapse video from one snail to see how it moved its
flap across its shell. The snail was filmed indoors in a small dish. I also checked flap
regeneration for snails operated on 1 and 3 weeks earlier.
Results
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Light Microscopy
An ambiguous network - either extracellular matrix or artifact - was strewn across both
the top and bottom surfaces of the flap. SEM of the bottom surface of the flap (Fig. 3a) revealed
a dense packing of relatively long (approx. 4um) cilia lining the lateral edges of the flap (Fig. 3b
and 3c). At high magnification, raised spots of concentrated, short (approx. 1.5um), possibly
sensory cilia or microvilli peppered the otherwise smooth bottom surface of the flap (Fig. 3d).
The cilia were seen under compound light microscope as well. Cilia visible at 100x beat
in uncoordinated waves. Small organic particles that contacted the cilia spun in place in squash
preps as well as water-immersion preps, caught by the small water currents created by the cilia.
