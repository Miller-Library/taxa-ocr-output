Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Figure Legends
Figure 1. Number of Olivella at the surface after being treated with a half hour, an hour, and two
hours of darkness. Snails with flaps were compared to snails without flaps, and no significant
difference was found (ANOVA; p = 0.17). A snail was counted as exposed if any portion of its
shell was visible for the numbers in this graph. Snails were also counted when half or more and
100% of their shell was exposed, and no significant difference was found.
Figure 2. Number of Olivella buried as a percentage of the number visible immediately after
exposing the snails to daylight. Counts were taken 2, 5, and 10 minutes after exposure to
daylight, and snails with flaps were compared to snails without flaps. No significant difference
was found (ANOVA; p = 0.59).
Figure 3. Length of time it took to find the mussel, for each snail that did find it, was converted
from the number of snails feeding at each time period. Note that snails were not timed
individually, but counted at set intervals. Thus the averages are most likely overestimated.
However, given the large significance (T-test; p Â« 0.001), the trend should hold for the actual
averages as well.
Figure 4. The ventral surface of the mantle flap of Olivella biplicata. This surface is in direct
contact with the shell in vivo. (A) The flap extends from the top left, where the structure is
attached to the mantle in the live animal (some severed mantle tissue is labeled M), down right to
the tip of the flap (T). (B) An enlargement of the boxed area in A reveals a band of cilia along the
