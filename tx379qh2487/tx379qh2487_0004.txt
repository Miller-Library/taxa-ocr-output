Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
procedure after one month was 100%. In all experiments control snails with flaps were of
comparable size to those without flaps.
Light Response
To test the role of the flap in photo-detection, 10 Olivella were placed in each of 6
32x17x8cm plastic tubs, filled with 2cm of sand and supplied with a constant flow of sea water.
Half of the tubs contained snails without flaps. After snails had fully buried (1 hr.), tubs were
wrapped with foil, and snails were left in darkness for Â½, 1, or 2 hours. I then removed the foil
and immediately tallied the number of snails visible. Additional counts were made at 2, 3 and 10
minutes after exposure. The experiment was repeated 3 times for both treatment groups - flap
and no flap - and treatment groups were systematically rotated between tubs to prevent
confounding effects of variation between different tubs. To account for varying activity levels
due to different ambient light intensities and time of day, I performed experiments under a range
of initial conditions, such as cloudy, sunny, morning, noon, and afternoon.
Feeding Response
Snails with and without flaps were placed in separate 34x30x13cm tubs, 41 individuals in
each. Several small, whole mussels were crushed and randomly dropped, shell and all, into each
tub. Empty mussel shells were placed in a third tub to control for disturbance. Snails were
monitored for activity over a period of 2 hours. Initially I counted the number of snails
performing various behaviors at given time intervals, however, for data analysis, I converted
these numbers to average times per snail to locate mussel meat.
