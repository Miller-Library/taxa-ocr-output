Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Light/Dark Response
The number of snails visible at the surface after ½, 1, and 2 hours is plotted in Fig. 1. The
emergence rate of snails with flaps does not differ significantly from those without flaps
(ANOVA; p = 0.17). The subsequent reburial response (Fig. 2) again shows no significant
difference between snails with and without their flaps (ANOVA; p = 0.59)
Feeding Response
Snails did not respond consistently to food stimulants, but for one successful experiment
the number of snails feeding at given time intervals was compared between snails with flaps and
snails without flaps. Snails with their flaps located the food, on average, about one hour faster
than snails without flaps (T-test; p « 0.001). Empty-mussel-shell control snails were inactive
throughout the experiment.
Shell Cleaning And Flap Regeneration
No algae or diatom colonies developed on any snails’ shells in one week, and the snail in
the 12 hr. time-lapse recording did not move its flap appreciably. Regeneration had begun after
only 1 week (Fig. 4a). Äfter three weeks, flaps had about half regenerated (Fig. 4b).
Discussion
Excising the mantle flap does not affect Olivella's light sensing ability. This result
indicates that the flap is not light sensitive, and the light sensory ability resides elsewhere. A
comparison between this experiment and the light/dark response as reported first by Phillips
(1977b) implies that population density may affect individual snail behavior. Snail density in
