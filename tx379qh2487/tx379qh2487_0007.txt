Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Phillips’ experiment was 645 individuals per m’, which is at the upper limit of naturally
occurring densities (Abbott and Hadderlie, 1980). After 2 hours of artificially imposed darkness,
only 53% of Phillips’ snails had emerged. Snails in my experiment were packed about 1/3 as
densely, and 95% had emerged after only 1 hour. The effects of between-snail interactions may
have considerable consequences for behavioral studies, ecology, and other processes governed by
snail behavior.
The role of the flap in shell cleaning remains ambiguous. The negative results from the
fouling experiment and time lapse video does not exclude the possibility that over a longer
period, fouling and flap movement will occur. Nor have I tested whether the onset of fouling
stimulates the flap to clean the shell. Conversely, the nature of the snail's lifestyle may prevent
fouling. The sand could scrape the shell clean, or even polish it, or the snails' nocturnal pattern
could prevent algae from growing, since photosynthesis cannot occur at night. Further study is
needed.
In the feeding experiments, control snails located chemical stimulant sources faster than
snails without flaps, indicating that the flap has chemosensory capabilities. Although I was
unable to run controls for the effects of injury or treatment with MgCl,, snails manipulated for
the light/dark experiments showed no aversion to injury or MgCl,. In preliminary experiments,
after removing the flap, manipulated snails displayed normal burial and activity patterns. These
observations suggest that loss of flap functionality reduces the snails' sensitivity to chemical
stimulants.
The flap’s ultrastructure also suggests chemosensory function. The ciliated band around
the flap resembles the cilia found in the squid olfactory organ (Gilly and Lucero, 1991), in which
beating cilia hold chemical stimulants close to a central chemoreceptor. The flap has no obvious
