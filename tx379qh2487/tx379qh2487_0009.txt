Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Conclusion
The mantle flap of Olivella plays no role in sensing light, but probably does play a role in
food detection and olfaction in general. The latter is questionable, but makes sense given the
ecology of the open ocean sandy beach. To resolve whether the flap is olfactory, I recommend
f√ºrther visualization of the ciliary band around the flap, and the nerves innervating it. In addition.
electrophysiological techniques could contribute valuable insights. If the flap were found to be
chemosensory, the next step would be to determine which stimulants cause the strongest
responses. The structure may have multiple functions, and though the flap does not appear to
clean the shell, I suggest further exploration of this option as well.
