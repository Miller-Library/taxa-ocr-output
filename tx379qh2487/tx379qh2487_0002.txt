Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Introduction
The neogastropod snail Olivella biplicata lives on sandy substrate from the low intertidal
zone to as deep as 50m. It ranges from Vancouver Island, British Colombia to Bahia Magdalena,
Baja California, and can reach an abundance of up to 650 individuals per mâ€™ (Abbott and
Hadderlie, 1980). The animal is nocturnal; it buries itself a few millimeters under the sand during
the day and comes up at night to scavenge for drift kelp and a variety of live and dead animals.
Previously reported behaviors for Olivella include: intertidal zonation (Edwards, D. C., 1969a),
reproduction and mate sensing (Edwards, D. C., 1968), a predator escape response (Phillips, D.
W., 1977a; Edwards, D. C., 1969b), and a light/dark response (Phillips, D. W., 1977b), and a
feeding response briefly mentioned by Phillips (1977b).
The snail possesses a large foot for crawling and burying in the sand and a siphon for
pulling water across a single gill and osphradium. The osphradium lies adjacent to the gill in the
mantle cavity and has been implicated in olfaction for other prosobranch species (Burke, W. R.
1964; Copeland, M., 1918). A flap-like extension of mantle tissue lays flat on top of the shell,
exposed unless disturbed, in which case it retracts. I have seen it extended in various orientations,
but how the flap moves into different orientations is not clear.
This study combined an ultrastructural analysis with a behavioral study to investigate the
role of the mantle flap. Reported here are possible roles the flap plays in light detection,
chemoreception, and shell cleaning.
