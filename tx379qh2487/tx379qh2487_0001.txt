Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Abstract: The neogastropod mollusk Olivella biplicata possesses an extension of the mantle
fold referred to as the mantle flap. Its function is undetermined. The structure extends from
mantle tissue dorsal to the siphon and lays flat against the exposed top surface of the animal's
shell, rarely covering more than approximately 20% of the shell surface. It may extend as far
back as the apical whorl of the shell and can be fully retracted. Excised flaps begin
regeneration within one week. The structure plays no part in the light sensing ability of the
nocturnal snail, but may affect its ability to sense water-borne chemicals. Olivella with their
mantle flaps artificially removed locate crushed Mytillus roughly one hour slower than
unmanipulated counterparts (PÂ£0.01). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and light
microscopy reveal dense, motile cilia lining the lateral edges of the flap. SEM of the surface of
the structure in direct contact with shell makes visible possible sensory cilia. No evidence was
found for the potential role of the flap in shell cleaning. A program for future study directed at
elucidating the function of the mantle flap is suggested.
