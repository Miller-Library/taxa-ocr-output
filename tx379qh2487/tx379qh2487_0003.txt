Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
Materials and Methods
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM and Light Microscopy (LM)
Mantle flaps were visualized using a variety of techniques, and then analyzed for
functional structures.
1 made squash preps of freshly excised mantle flaps for compound light microscopy.
Water-immersion lens allowed visualization of the tissue, without the negative effects of the
squash prep.
Mantle flaps were fixed for scanning electron microscopy by two methods employing
different fixatives. The best results were obtained with tissue fixed by the procedure given for
fixation of external tissues by Dobbs (1974-1978), which consisted of treatment with
gluteraldehyde without post-treatment in osmium tetroxide. Fixation in Parduczâ€™ fixative as
described by Phillips (1976) involved treatment with mercuric chloride and osmium tetroxide.
The procedure lysed the tissue surface, so these preps were discarded for this study.
Behavioral Experiments
Olivella were collected subtidally from sandy substrate in the Hopkins Marine Life
Refuge, Pacific Grove, California. Specimens remained for a maximum of two weeks in a
49x49x32cm aquarium supplied with a constant flow of unfiltered sea water. Throughout the
study period, aquaria water temperatures paralleled environmental temperatures, and snails were
not fed.
For experiments involving snails without flaps, the structure was severed as close to the
shell aperture as possible. Snails were anesthetized in isotonic MgCl,. Survival rate for the
