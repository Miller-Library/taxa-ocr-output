Josh Rapport: Mantle flap function in Olivella biplicata
central chemoreceptor, but sensory cells may reside underneath the motile cilia. The next step is
to take cross sections of the flap or remove the motile cilia with protease to analyze what kinds of
cells exist concealed by the ciliary mat.
Since the osphradium is most likely a chemosensory organ (Copeland, 1918; Burke,
1964), the flap probably enhances olfaction or provides a backup chemosensor. Olivella often
pull their siphons below the surface of the sand (personal observation), which may make it
difficult to draw water across the osphradium. Having a second chemosensor exposed directly to
the surrounding medium could optimize food sensing. This may be vital over the sparsely
inhabited sandy substrate where food is scarce (Ricketts et al., 1985).
The short regeneration time and low fatality for removal of the flap are consistent with
this model of the flap’s use. As exposed soft tissue, the flap is vulnerable to injury. If the animal
has evolved a need to risk the structure, we should anticipate that its loss would not jeopardize
the animal’s health. This is true as evidenced by zero fatality for flap removal. At the same time,
if the structure increases the animal’s chances of survival, we should, and do, see fast
regeneration.
Electrophysiological techniques may provide the best opportunity to establish the
chemosensory capabilities of the flap. Large, easily accessible nerves extend from the cerebral
ganglia (personal observation), providing the opportunity for nerve staining and visualizing
innervation patterns. Potentially, one could record activity from the nerves and determine what
stimulates action potentials, although whole cell recordings of flap neurons may be more feasible
(Gilly, W. F., personal communication).
