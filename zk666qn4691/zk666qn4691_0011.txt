significant, the p-value was small enough to suggest that there is some interaction, and that
examining it might yield interesting results.
The data that I currently have shows little clear patterning. When comparing mussel beds
within time points (refer to Fig. 5), the set of tests which should clarify whether the relationship
between mussel beds changes over time, there is very little significance. This is not surprising.
given that the interaction term in the ANÃ–VA (see Table III) is non-significant. As noted in Fig.
10, the SNK test is significant for time points 2 and 3. It is significant only over all the 4 mussel
beds however, and does not resolve at the 3 mean level where both ranges are non-significant.
This does not lend itself to a clear interpretation, as no bed can be said to be significantly
different from the others. Setting aside strict statistical significance, there is an interesting
pattern between mussel beds and a distinct change at time point four. At time one, the high sites
show higher activity than the low sites, but the high and low sites switch ranking at time 2,
while maintaining rank in relation to each other. From time 2 to time 3, the cool high and warm
low sites converge in activity, and the remaining sites switch rank again, becoming the extreme
high and low values. At time 4, all the sites are close to each other, and through times 5, and 6,
remain relatively close, tracking an increase in activity. At time 7, the cool low, and warm high
sites drop in activity compared to the other two which drop only a little.
Post-hoc comparisons of CAT activity between sampling times, averaged over mussel
beds, reveals a significant difference between time point 6 and the group of time points 1,2, and
3. There was no significant difference between time points 4, 5 and 7, and either time point 6 or
the group of time points 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 4).
