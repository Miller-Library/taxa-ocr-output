2010). Temperature is variable in the intertidal on scales small enough to reasonably expect two
mussel beds at the spatial scale of my experimental beds to vary (Helmuth et al. 2010). It is
possible that differences in the temperature regime faced by the various mussel beds are the
underlying driver for the changing enzyme activity levels.
Of particular interest is the significant difference in mussel bed means, seen at times 2
and 3, which is lost at time 4 and not regained through time 7. This suggests that either some
disturbance was present at time points 2 and 3, or some disturbance began at time point 4.
Whether it was an acute event which elicited a response that took some time to ramp up (time 6
has higher activity than time 4), an acute event which elicited a response that remained high for
some time afterward as a safe guard, or a chronic stress event that may have begun to alleviate at
time 7 is unclear. The nature of this perturbation and the response has implications for cellular
energy budgets (Roberts et al. 1997) which may lead to decreased fitness, decreased competitive
ability and eventually changes in community structure (Society 2011).
Interpreting the Catalase results is further complicated by the reality that Catalase is not
the only enzyme to break down H2O2, and superoxide is not the only source. glutathione
reductase also breaks down HpO2 to water and oxygen via a different pathway (Posmyk et al.
2001). Additionally, numerous peroxidases are present in high concentrations in certain
organelles, and produce H2O2 (Roberts et al. 1997). Therefore, the activity levels observed are
actually the end result of a number of processes that affect the concentration of the substrate
(H2O2) and therefore the need for detoxification by Catalase.
