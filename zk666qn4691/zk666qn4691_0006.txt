and approximately horizontal, and the other higher, on an angle, and in a surge channel. I had a
total of four mussel beds in this study.
Experimental Design:
The sampling scheme for collecting samples to be analyzed consisted of ten sampling
time points over five days of spring tides, during the first week of July, 2010. At each time
point, six mussels were taken from the mussel beds, selected in a haphazard manner. They were
returned to the lab, dissected, and the gill tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a-80°C
freezer. The sampling took place each day before and after the lower low tide, which occurred in
the early morning, when the water level was 3.Oft above the mean lower low water mark. The
odd time points represent approximately the beginning of emersion, and even ones represent the
beginning of immersion. Over a period of five days, the duration between time points remains
relatively constant (approximately 6 hours between time point 1 and 2, 18 between time point 2
and 3, and again, approximately 6 hours between time point 3 and 4).
Later in July, up to 0.1g of tissue (when available) from each mussel was homogenized
using a TissueLyzer6 in 9 parts phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.8, yielding 1:9 dilutions
homogenates. The resulting supernatant was aliquotted into two tubes, and frozen. In August of
2010, the tubes were defrosted in batches and MDH and CS activity assays were performed on
the samples. The homogenates were frozen again at -80°C.
In May of 2011 after establishing that SÖD and CAT are robust to at least one freeze¬
thaw cycle, the remaining homogenates were once again thawed, the aliquots of each mussel
were pooled, and SOD and CAT activity assays were performed (see below for assay procedure).
As a procedural control against day to day variations in the assay solution, two homogenates
