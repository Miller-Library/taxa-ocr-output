from each time point were thawed in sets of between 10 and 15 until the seventh time point was
reached. The process was then repeated, yielding an n—4 for each mussel bed for the first seven
time points. Äfter being assayed, any remaining homogenate was noted to have been thawed a
second time, and refrozen.
Superoxide Dismutase Activity Assay:
This assay is adapted from McCord and Fridovich (1969). Given that the O2 radical is
unstable under metabolically relevant pHs, this assay couples together a number of reactions.
The generation of O2 is achieved by the oxidation of xanthine by xanthine oxidase. In the
absence of SÖD, cytochrome c scavenges the O2 radicals and is so reduced. The rate at which
this occurs is considered the “control rate", and this change in oxidation state of cytochrome c
drives the change in absorbance at 550 nanometers, recorded by the spectrophotometer.
The introduction of any SÖD present in a volume of sample lowers the rate of
cytochrome c reduction by “competing" with the cytochrome c to scavenge the O2' and convert it
to H2O2. The hydrogen peroxide has the potential to interact with other enzymes present in the
sample, or in impure preparations of the xanthine oxidase, driving the re-oxidization of
cyctochrome c. Catalase is added to the sample to break down the hydrogen peroxide and
prevent confounding.
For my assays, I determined that 8.7 uL of xanthine oxidase in 1.2 mL of cocktail
(composed of phosphate buffer + EDTA pH 7.64, 2.5 mL of 1mM xanthine, 500 uL ImM
cyctochrome C, and 100 uL 1mM Catalase) yielded a rate of cytochrome c oxidation of about
0.0200 absorbance units increase over a span of one minute. The addition of 10 uL of sample
was sufficient to yield on average, inhibition between 30 and 70%, which given the hyperbolic
