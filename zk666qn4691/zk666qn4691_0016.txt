would suggest that the levels of SÖD observed are sufficient to prevent RÖS related DNA
damage.
Conclusion:
This study reveals that in the intertidal, small spatial and temporal variations in abiotic
factors are sufficient to drive significant changes in Catalase enzyme activity. These changes in
activity are thought to be closely correlated with changing concentrations of the reactive oxygen
species that are this enzyme’s substrate. These results therefore suggest changing concentrations
of RÖS, which we know have significant capability to cause damage in cells if not detoxified.
This study helps lay the groundwork to elucidate the relationship between RÖS production, RÖS
damage, and ROS detoxification.
