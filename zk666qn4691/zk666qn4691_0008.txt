nature of units of SÖD vs. % inhibition, is the range of inhibitions over which the assay is most
accurate (McCord & Fridovich 1969).
Each day, the average background rate of cytochrome c oxidation was determined to
account for innate daily variation. Each sample was assayed three times. The data were
collected in excel, and a linear regression was run on the first 20 seconds of each data file in
order to avoid possible curvature due to slowing down of reactions as they run out of substrate.
A visual inspection of a scatter plot of the data from each assay determined whether any small
jumps or dips in the data (1 or 2 points) were likely to be significantly affecting the p-value.
These values were discarded and the regression re-run. The slope of the regression was
converted to units of SÖD using the relationship: units of inhibition = (standardized activity of
sample) / (100 - standardized activity of sample) and standardized activity of sample = ((rate of
change in absorbance of daily average background - rate of change in absorbance of individual
assay) / rate of change in absorbance of daily average background rate) * 100. Given this
relationship, one unit is defined as 50% inhibition of the “control rate" (rate of change in
absorbance of daily average background) of cytochrome c inhibition. The p-values for each
regression were checked, and those below 0.95 were discarded. The choice to reject p-values
below 0.95 was arbitrary, but driven by the consistent ability to attain p-values above 0.98 (data
not shown). Very few samples were rejected (less than 5%). The remaining two assays for each
sample were averaged to yield the SÖD activity. For those samples that all three assays had
sufficiently high p-values, the two closer trials were averaged to yield overall activity.
