Felton 10
This assay is adapted from Beers and Sizer (1952); updated by Weydert and Cullen
(2010). In this assay, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is broken down by CAT present in the sample.
yielding a decrease in absorbance at 240 nanometers (UV range). Since there is potentially
significant background rates of CAT, breaking down hydrogen peroxide already present in the
sample, each sample must have a background rate obtained, by adding 25 uL of the sample to 0.5
mL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.64) and recording absorbance over two minutes. Each sample is
then assayed two times in a solution of H2O2 in phosphate buffer. In general, the CAT replicates
tend to be closer than SOD replicates and so it is not necessary to do them in triplicate (data not
shown).
The data file for each individual assay was collected in Excel, and a scatter plot used to
determine whether any data points (usually the first) would be dropped. In this case, the p-values
for the background rates were consistently low, which would be expected when the rate is close
to zero. The background rates were subtracted from the average of the two CAT trials, unless
some significant anomaly required the exclusion of one of the trials, in which case no average
was obtained (less than 5% of cases)
Statistical Analysis:
This experiment consisted of two fixed factors, time and mussel bed. Even though the
mussel beds were each sampled repeatedly, the level of interest is the individual mussel.
Combined with the decision to treat time as a fixed factor, this avoids the need for a repeated
measure ANOVA.
The linear model for the 2 factor, Model I ANÃ–VA is: x = time point + mussel bed +
time point * mussel bed + g; where x = SOD or CAT activity. To answer whether the
