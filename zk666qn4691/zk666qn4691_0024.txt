Figure Legends:
Fig. 1. An aerial view of Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove Ca.
The rectangle notes the approximate location of my two study sites.
Fig. 2. Superoxide dismutase activity by time point. Each box and whisker plot represents one
time point, with an N = 16. The values charted are the 16 mussels for the time point, pooled
across all mussel beds.
Fig. 3. Superoxide dismutase activity by mussel bed. Each box and whisker plot represents one
mussel bed with an N=28. The data plotted are the 28 samples drawn from each mussel bed over
the 7 time points.
Fig. 4. Catalase activity at each time point, averaged over the four mussel beds. This figure
shows the mean and one standard error of Catalase activity for each time point, pooled over the
four mussel beds. There is significance between time points 1, 2 and 3, and time point 6 as
indicated by the asterisks.
Fig. 5. Catalase activity by time point for each mussel bed. The Catalase activity observed in the
four mussel beds are plotted on the same graph, against time in order to visualize how the plots
