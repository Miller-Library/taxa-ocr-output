INTRODUCTION
Reactive Oxygen Species
Reactive oxygen species (RÖS) are oxygen containing molecules like O2 (superoxide
radical), H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), and ÖH(hydroxyl radical) that include unpaired electrons.
The study of these molecules, and their role in cells began in earnest in 1969 with the discovery
of the function of erythrocuprein (hemocuprein) by Irwin Fridovich (McCord & Fridovich 1969).
Since then, it has been established that reactive oxygen species can drive a variety of useful
processes in the cell including retrograde redox signaling to other parts of the cell from the
mitochondria (Miriyala et al. 201 1), as a modulator of cellular apoptosis (Fulda et al. 2010), and
as a cellular defense against infection (Slauch 201 1). Reactive oxygen species also have great
potential to cause irreversible damage to membrane lipids, ribosomal machinery, and DNA (Liu
et al. 2011; Caporossi 2003; Roberts et al. 1997). The damage caused by RÖS either directly or
through erroneous regulation of a physiological process (Miriyala et al. 201 1) is speculated to
contribute to conditions like hypertension (Hirooka 2011), epilepsy (Waldbaum & Patel 2010)
and Alzheimer’s Disease (Lakatos et al. 2010). The balance between RÖS production and ROS
detoxification is therefore extremely important to the healthy functioning of cells.
Two of the biggest cellular sources of the superoxide radical are the oxidative energy
generating processes of photosynthesis (Collén et al. 2007) and aerobic respiration (Selivanov et
al. 2011). Superoxide is formed when electrons are “leaked" to oxygen from the electron
transport chains or photo system two (Han et al. 2001). Superoxide itself' is not a very reactive
molecule, and so causes little damage itself. It does however reduce cytochrome c (a key
component in metabolism) and participates in the formation of more reactive species like
hydrogen peroxide, to which DNA is particularly vulnerable (Caporossi 2003). It is predicted
