Table III. Catalase activity analysis of variance. The interaction term is not significant, but too
small to dismiss entirely and thus pool with the error. The main effect of mussel bed also not
significant. The main effect of time point is highly significant however. Given the huge number
of degrees of freedom, the ANÃ–VA is extremely sensitive.
