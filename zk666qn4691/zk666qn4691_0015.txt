Besides finishing this data set, further tests are needed to contextualize this study. Given
the consistency in the assay, and the sensitivity to inter-individual variation, the Catalase assay
should be the focus of further study.
The advantages of working in the field are balanced by the disadvantage of being unable
to control everything. There is significant potential for confounding, particularly in a design like
this one, which controls for tidal height. Differences may be due to temperature, emersion,
desiccation, tidal or diurnal cycles, etc. Patterns of enzyme activity that correlate with the tidal
cycle have been found in metabolic enzymes (malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase) in M.
californianus (Laurie Kost, personal communication). A further study in the field would focus
on sampling over a tidal cycle, to try to determine if there are also cyclic changes in the activity
of Catalase. Laboratory experiments that would help clarify the potential effect of abiotic factors
include heat ramps and ambient temperature emersion.
Further limitations on this study include that we cannot determine whether the changes in
activity level are due to changes in the concentration of the enzyme, or post translational
modifications. Western blotting may be able to determine whether the concentrations of the
enzymes are changing. There is little indication that post translational modification of either
SOD or CAT is employed in vivo for activity regulation, but may be elucidated with careful 2-D
gel work.
As discussed above in the SÖD discussion section, it is unclear whether levels of stress
were high enough to induce a response. One way to get at this question post-experiment is to
assay DNA damage. Since RÖS target macromolecules including DNA if they are not
detoxified, an increase in DNA damage might suggest that RÖS damage is occurring, and the
detoxifying mechanisms are either not responding, or are overwhelmed. A lack of damage
