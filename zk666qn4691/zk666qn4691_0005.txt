the potential for ROS detoxification based on their need; rather than maintaining constitutively
high levels in the cell. Previous work I conducted last summer, indicates that there is sufficient
variability between mussel beds (compared to between individual mussels within a bed) to drive
significant changes in the activity of the metabolic enzymes malate dehydrogenase and citrate
synthase. Both enzymes show significant changes in activity parsed by time and location
(ANÖVA, p-value = 0.05). Assuming the link between metabolism and ROS production is
robust (as suggested by Tomanek and Zuzow), I believe it is reasonable to expect a similar
pattern in the activity levels of RÖS detoxifying enzymes.
METHODS
Study Site:
China point at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove Ca. is on the leeward side of the
Monterey peninsula. The geography of the point is such that the west side is more wave exposed
than the east side, and this is reflected by a gradient in the distribution of classically "wave
exposed" and “wave protected" species from west to east along the shore (Bell & M.W. Denny
1994). On the more wave exposed site, the rocky substratum in the mid intertidal is dominated
by Mytilus Californianus, the ubiquitous ribbed mussel, which is found in temperate zones along
the western coast of the United States (Morris et. al. 1980). My study site is located near the tip
of the point, on either side (north and south) of a set of boulders (Fig. 1). I selected two mussel
beds on the north side of the boulders, expected to be cool, one lower in the intertidal, and
having an approximately horizontal aspect, and one higher in the intertidal and approximately
vertical in aspect. On the south side of the boulders, expected to experience warmer
temperatures than the north facing sites, I selected two mussel beds, one lower in the intertidal
