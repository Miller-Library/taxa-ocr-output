significant changes in SOD activity, explained at least partially by Q1o effects (Abele et al.
1998). The question remains open then as to whether the mussels in this experiment experienced
a strong enough stimulus to generate an RÖS detoxification response. Recent work in mussels
found changes in the amount of RÖS detoxifying enzymes present in Mytilus trossolus and
Mytilus galloprovincialis driven by the max temperature in an acute heat stress event (24 - 32°C)
(Tomanek & Zuzow 2010). Further work indicates that there are differences in gene expression
of enzymes involved in oxidative stress between cold and warm adapted congeners in the genus
Mytilus (Lockwood et al. 2010) when exposed to temperatures up to 32°C. Given current
understanding of the relationship between temperature and oxidative stress, it may be
advantageous to conduct heat ramps in the laboratory to determine the response of SÖD in order
to establish levels at which a coherent response is elicited.
Catalase:
Given the intriguing pattern that appears to be present for the first 3 time points, that is
then lost for times 4, 5 and 6, and appears to be changing yet again at time 7, it is imperative that
I add the remainder of the data set. This will increase the N to 6 (from 4) and the number of time
points to 10. Assuming that the patterns visible now reflect what is really going on, and
additional data will serve to simply strengthen the pattern, we can speculate now on the drivers
behind the patterns.
Fig. 10 demonstrates that the activity levels of the mussel beds are changing in relation to
one another. This suggests that whatever is driving the activity levels, is not applying the same
pressure to each mussel bed through time. Öthers have shown that temperature and salinity
correlate with changes in protein expression (Lockwood & Somero 2011; Tomanek & Zuzow
