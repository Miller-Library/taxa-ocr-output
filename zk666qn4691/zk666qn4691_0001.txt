ABSTRACT
The study of superoxide dismutase and Catalase is important due to their role in detoxifying
reactive oxygen species. Our understanding of the functioning of these enzymes is forwarded
through the assaying the activity of these enzymes in Mytilus californianus over small spatial and
temporal scales. Superoxide dismutase appears to be extremely variable from individual to
individual, and may not be a useful tool to generalize about reactive oxygen species trends.
While statistical significance is lacking, the patterns which emerge from the Catalase activity
yield compelling arguments to continue the use of the intertidal as a study system to determine
the scale on which these enzymes vary and what factors drive this variation.
