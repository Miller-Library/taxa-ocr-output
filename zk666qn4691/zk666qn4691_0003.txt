that between 1 and 2% of the oxygen consumed by organisms through oxidative metabolism is
converted to ROS (Roberts et al. 1997). Reactive oxygen species are an unavoidable, potentially
toxic, side product of ATP production. The cells must therefore have a way to prevent RÖS
from causing significant damage.
Cells have a variety of defenses against RÖS, including antioxidant compounds and
antioxidant enzymes. Among the cellular enzymes employed to detoxify RÖS are superoxide
dismutase (SÖD) and Catalase (CAT). These enzymes work sequentially to take O2’ and convert
it to H2O2 and then to water and free oxygen. This detoxification process is a key, energy
consuming process, in preventing damage to the cell (Roberts et al. 1997). In order to clarify the
potential for ROS damage and what conditions it might lead to, it is imperative that we study the
processes that drive ROS production as well as their detoxification within a cell.
The Intertidal
A rocky intertidal zone appears to be an ideal place to work on understanding ROS.
Since ROS is produced during aerobic respiration in heterotrophic organisms (Selivanov et al.
2011), it is reasonable to suspect that perturbations to aerobic respiration might drive
perturbations in ROS production, inciting a response by the cells detoxifying machinéry
(Fridovich 1986). The intertidal is often lauded as a model study system for ecological and
physiological studies because of large physical gradients over short vertical distances. The
intertidal is also favored for experiments due to accessibility and rapid turnover.
The intertidal zone has been demonstrated to have sufficient variability in physiologically
relevant factors from location to location to drive changes in aerobic respiration (Dahlhoff et al.
2001). Recent work found increasing abundance of proteins that generate NADPH, which is
