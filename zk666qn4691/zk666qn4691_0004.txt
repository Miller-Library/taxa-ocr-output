implicated in ROS defense, with acute temperature stress in blue mussels (Tomanek & Zuzow
2010). These findings suggest that the congener species, Mytilus californianus, the intertidal
ribbed mussel, is well situated to be developed into a study system for understanding the balance
between ROS production and RÖS detoxification. However, careful temperature measurements
reveal that the scale of variability of physiologically relevant factors may be much smaller than
long assumed (on the scale of centimeters to meters), and that mussels in the same bed can vary
in minimum and maximum body temperatures, the rate of increase (and decrease) in
temperature, and the accumulated sub-lethal thermal stress (Mark W. Denny et al. 2011). It is
unclear however whether these micro-scale variations are sufficient to affect the balance of ROS.
In order to determine whether temperature and other abiotic variations inherent to the
intertidal affect the balance of RÖS, it must be established whether micro-scale variations affect
ROS detoxification, and whether the magnitude of this effect is greater than the magnitude of the
difference between mussel beds (a larger spatial scale). Enzyme activity assays like SÖD and
Catalase lend themselves to determining whether micro-scale variations affect ROS
detoxification since they are relatively straightforward (Beers & Sizer 1952; updated by Weydert
& Cullen 2010), have been shown to be good indicators of overall RÖS concentration (Fridovich
1986). My question therefore is do four mussel beds, located near each other, always have the
same relationship to each other in terms of enzyme activity? Does this activity change from one
time to another?
Hypothesis
Given that RÖS detoxification is an energy requiring process (Roberts et al. 1997), and
the resources available to a cell are limited, I believe it is reasonable to expect cells to regulate
