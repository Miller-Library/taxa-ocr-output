relationship between mussel beds over time stays consistent, the term of interest is the interaction
term. If it is significant, then the relationship between the mussel beds does not stay constant
through time.
Äfter the ANÖVA, the data was checked for homoskedasticity using Cochran’s test, and
a visual inspection of residuals for gross departures from normality. Having found no significant
violations to the assumptions of homoskedasticity and normality of residuals, SNK tests were
performed for CAT data on time points pooled over mussel beds and for mussel beds within each
time point. Visual inspections of box and whisker plots and line plots yielded further
information on trends in the relationship between the mussel beds.
RESULTS
Superoxide Dismutase:
There was no significant interaction between time point and mussel bed and no
significant effect of either main factor (see Table 1). Even with pooling the MSwithin (see Table
II), there is no significance. At this point, I constructed box and whisker plots to visualize the
not significance. Figs. 4 and 5 show the data grouped by time point and mussel bed respectively.
Catalase:
The ANOVA for CAT yielded a not significant interaction term, and a not significant
effect of mussel beds. It did yield a significant effect of time point however. Given this, I ran an
SNK test, with a critical value = Q.o25.m.7 * V(MSeror/ 16) on time points pooled over mussel
beds (See Fig. 4 for a graph of this data). I also ran an SNK test with a critical value = Qo25.m.77
* V(MSerror / 6) on mussel beds within time points because while the interaction term was not
