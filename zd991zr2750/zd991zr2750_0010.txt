communication). In addition, the functionality of chloroplasts
should be tested after incubation in A smithihomogenates i.e., the
amount of labeled carbon fixed by chloroplasts incubated in A
smithi homogenates should be compared to the amount of
radioactive carbon fixed by chloroplasts of the control medium
incubation.
when ! tested the control medium and the medium from re-fed
E. hedgpethi homogenate for chlorophyll the results were negative.
Furthermore, chloroplasts incubated in homogenates of E hedgpethl
showed the same photosynthetic ability as chloroplasts incubated in
control medium (F.Glaser, personal communication). Thus, it is
evident that the release of photosynthate is not due to severe lysis
of the chloroplast envelope when chloroplasts are incubated in
E hedgpethi homogenates.
The incubations of chloroplasts in E hedgpethi extracts should
be repeated at 17 Â°C to compare with data collected by Glaser and
others. Finally, to help clarify the limitations of using tissue
extracts to study living systems, further investigations should
ipvolve invivo studies on the release of photosynthate from the
symbiotic chloroplasts of E hedgpethi.
