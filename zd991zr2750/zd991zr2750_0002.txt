photosynthetically active after incorporation into the animal
(Greene, 1970a: Greene and Muscatine, 1972). Studies done on Elysia
viridis, another sacoglossan, demonstrate that the chloroplasts of
Cfragile are likewise incorporated into the digestive cells and
continue to photosynthesize at rates comparable to those in the
intact alga (Trench et al., 1973b). Further investigations by Trench,
Boyle and Smith (1973b) indicate that 368 of the photosynthate
fixed by the ingested chloroplasts is released to the animal tissue.
Trench et al. (1973b) found that a greater percentage of fixed carbon
was released from chloroplasts incubated in Eviridis homogenates
when compared with the percentage released from chloroplasts
incubated in simple mineral solution. This suggests that the animal
homogenate contains a factor which modifies the permeability of
the chloroplast envelope and hence, stimulates the release of fixed
carbon.
Gallop (1974) reported that the activity of the photosynthate
release factor was reduced significantly when chloroplasts were
incubated in homogenates from the non-chloroplast bearing tissues
of Eviridis. It has therefore been proposed that the presence of
chloroplasts within the digestive cells of symblotic sacoglossans is
necessary for the synthesis of the release factor (Gallop, 1974).
The studies presented here examine the activity of the
photosynthate release factor in Ehedgpethi when the digestive
cells are lacking chloroplasts versus its activity once chloroplasts
have been restored. To further investigate the relationship
between the photosynthate release factor in sacoglossan
homogenates and symbiotic chloroplasts, a comparative study was
