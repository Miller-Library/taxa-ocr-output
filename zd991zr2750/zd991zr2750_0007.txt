incubated in Cfragile homogenate they did not produce a greater
release of fixed carbon in comparison to chloroplasts incubated in
the control medium (Table 1 ).
Effect of Starved E hedgpethi Homogenate on the Belease of
Photosynthate from Isolated Chloroplasts:
Chloroplasts incubated in the homogenate from E hedgpethi
that were starved for 16 days show no significant difference in the
percentage of fixed carbon released when compared with control
medium incubation (Table 1).
Effect of Re-fed E hedgpethi Homogenate on the Release of
Photosynthate from Isolated Chloroplasts:
The homogenate from animals that were starved of
chloroplasts and then re-fed Cfragile does not enhance the
percentage of fixed carbon released to the incubation medium
(Table 1).
Effect of A smithi Homogenate on the Belease of Photosynthate
from Isolated Chloroplasts.
These results demonstrate a marked increase over control
values in the amount of fixed carbon released when chloroplasts
were incubated in A smithi homogenate (Table 1).
