Estimation of Eixed Carbon:
Supernatant fractions from the incubation media, washings and
extracted pellets were transferred to a 24-well plastic culture
dish. To drive off residual radioactive bicarbonate the solutions
were made 102 in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and shaken vigorously
for 15 minutes. The acidif ied fractions were mixed with 5 ml
scintillation fluid and the radioactivity analyzed with a Beckman
scintillation counter.
RESULIS
Analysis of Photosynthate Released Over Iime:
Chloroplasts containing radioactive photosynthate accumulated
over 2 hours were resuspended in fresh isolation medium and
incubated at room temperature. At times 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,
180, and 289 (in minutes af ter resuspension) aliquots of the
suspension were centrifuged and the supernatant and pellet
fractions analyzed for radioactivity (figure 1). The results indicate
that the amount of fixed carbon leaked to the suspension medium
reaches a maximum value by 15 minutes with no further increase
over 5 hours.
