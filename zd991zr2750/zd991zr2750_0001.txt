ABSIRACI
After 15 minutes, 1 12 of the photosynthate fixed by isolated
chloroplasts of Codium fragile was released to the control medium
The percentage released remained constant over a five hour period.
Chloroplasts incubated in homogenates of Cfragile did not release a
greater percentage of fixed carbon over chloroplasts incubated in
the control medium. Extracts from Elysia hedgpethi that were
starved for 16 days also did not induce the release of photosynthate
from isolated chloroplasts. Further experiments were done using
E hedgpethi that were starved for 22 days and then re-fed Cfragile
until their green color was restored (7 days). Homogenates of the
re-fed slugs again showed no increase in the percentage of fixed
carbon released. In one experiment using extracts from Aplysiopsis
smithi, 52.3% of the photosynthate was released from isolated
chloroplasts, over 2.5 times the percentage released to the control
medium.
INTRODUCTION
The sacoglossan Elysia hedgpethi is known to incorporate
chloroplasts from the siphonaceous alga Codium fragile within the
cells of its digestive diverticula (Greene, 1970b). It has been shown
that the chloroplasts taken up by the animal remain
