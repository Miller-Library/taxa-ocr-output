Assay of Photosynthate Release Eactor Actwity
Chloroplasts suspended in isolation medium were incubated
with Nah'4coz (10 uC1/m1) for 2 hours at saturating photosynthetic
irradiance (R. Zimmerman, personal communication). The amount of
radjoactive carbon fixed by chloroplasts incubated in the light was
greater than the amount of radioactive carbon fixed by chloroplasts
incubated in the dark by a factor of 13.7. Chloroplasts were then
collected by centrifugation (12,000 g, 2 min), washed in fresh
isolation medium, resuspended in the desired experimental
homogenate and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. In
control experiments, chloroplasts were incubated in isolation
medium at the same final chlorophyll concentration. After 60
minutes, the suspensions were pelleted down (12,000 g, 2 min), the
supernatants acidified and counts of radioactive carbon measured
(see below). The pellets were resuspended in 1 m1 95% hot methano
to extract the remaining photosynthate.
Chlorophyll Estimation:
Ope volume of chloroplast suspension was added to 9 volumes
cold acetone then centrifuged at 3900 g for 10 minutes. The amount
of extracted chlorophyll was calculated by measuring the
absorbance of the supernatant at 663 nm (effrey, 1968). The
reading was then standardized by the following equation:
OD reading (mMolar)/ 75.05/ 1000 x MW Chlorophylla
(893.53 g/mol) x 10 (dilution factor) = (chlorophylD mg/ml.
