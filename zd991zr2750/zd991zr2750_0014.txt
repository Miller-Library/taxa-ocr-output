FIGURE 1. RELEASE OF PHOTOSYNTHATE FROM CHLOROPLASTS IN
ISOLATION MEDIUM
Chloroplasts containing photosynthate accumulated over
2 hours were resuspended in fresh isolation medium then incubated
at room temperature. At times 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and
289 (in minutes after resuspension) aliquots of the suspension
were centrifuged and the supernatant and pellet fractions analyzed
for radioactivity. Figure 1. is a plot of the percentage of fixed
carbon released to the isolation medium at each time point tested.
