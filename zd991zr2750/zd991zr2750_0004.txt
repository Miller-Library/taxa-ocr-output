washing medium, the suspension was spun at approximately 800 g
for 4 minutes. The supernatant was then spun at 1000 g for
10 minutes (Shephard et al., 1968). Äfter discarding the new
supernatant fraction, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml washing
medium and spun at approximately 800 g for 4 minutes as before.
The chloroplast suspension was again spun at 1000 g for
10 minutes, the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended in
the final chloroplast isolation medium containing: mannitol 0.6 M;
potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate 10°9 M; hepes 5 x 10-3M
potassium chloride 10°2 M; magnesium chloride 5 x 10°9 M; adjusted
to ph 7.2.
Preparation of Sacoglossan Homogenate
Whole animals were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer at
a final concentration of 75 mg wet weight animal/ mi chloroplast
isolation medium (see above). Crude homogenates were then
centrifuged at 41,000 g for 60 minutes (4°) and the supernatant
used for the experimental incubation medium (Gallop, 1974).
Preparation of C fragile Homogenate:
C fragile fronds were minced with a razor blade, homogenized
in a Potter- Elueham homogenizer, then centrifuged at 1700 g for
15 minutes (4°C). The supernatant was the homogenate fraction
tested.
