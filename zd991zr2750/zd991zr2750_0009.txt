release factor to achieve a quantity sufficient to yield Ã 
measureable effect on the release of photosynthate. Yet, in a
presentation by Mart in Kozdrowicki on June 3, 1988 (Symposium of
the China Point Academy of Sciences - XXIV Annual) it was
announced that the chlorophyll content of Ehedgpethi starved free
of chloroplasts and then re-fed on Cfragile for 7 days was
equivalent to the chlorophyll content of animals that had not been
starved. Perhaps there is both a minimum chlorophyll concentration
and a minimum time period required for the activity of the
photosynthate release factor to be regained.
More likely, the release factor was destroyed during incubation.
Glaser (personal communication) reported that the activity of the
release factor was severely diminished after Ehedgpethi
homogenates were incubated for one hour at room temperature, the
temperature at which! conducted my incubations.
Data collected from A smithi homogenates strongly suggest
the presence of a photosynthate release factor. Unlike that of
E hedgpethi homogenates, the release factor of A smithi
homogenates, if such a factor exists, is not destroyed by incubation
at room temperature. However, since Asmithi are incapable of
incorporating chloroplasts (R. Swezey, personal communication) it
may be that this sacoglossan homogenate contains damaging
digestive enzymes which lyse chloroplast envelopes. To test this
the supernatant from chloroplasts incubated in A smithi extracts
should be measured for absorbance at 663 nm. A strong absorbance
would be indicative of chlorophyll in the supernatant and can be
interpreted as lysis of the chloroplasts (Denis Larochelle, personal
