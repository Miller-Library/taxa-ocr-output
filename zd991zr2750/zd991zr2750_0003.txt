done using the homogenate from Aplysiopsis smithi, a sacoglossan
unable to retain chloroplasts in its tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Maintenance of Animals:
E hedgpethi were collected on Cfragile in Santa Barbara. he
animals were maintained without food in a running sea water
aquarium illuminated with a battery of fluorescent lamps. Several
animals were starved for 22 days then transferred to an aerated
beaker containing filtered sea water and fresh Cfragile where they
were allowed to feed for 7 days.
Aplysiopsis smithi were collected from the mud flats at Noss
Landing State Beach (California). These animals were maintained in
a running sea water aquarium on a diet of Cfragile and Bryopsis
corticulans
Collection of C fragile:
Fresh C fragile was collected for use in each experiment from
the rocky intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove.
Chloroplast Isolation:
Chloroplasts were isolated from intact Cfragile using the
procedure developed by Shephard et al. (1968) with the following
modifications. After resuspending the initial pellet in 10 ml
