SUMARY
The amount of photosynthate released from chloroplasts to the
isolation medium reaches a maximum value in 15 minutes.
Homogenates from starvedE hedgpethi and re-fed Ebedgpethi did
pot demonstrate the ability to release fixed carbon from isolated
chloroplasts, whereas chloroplasts incubated in the homogenate of
A.smithireleased 52.3% of the total labeled photosynthate, over 2.5
times the percentage released in the control incubation.
