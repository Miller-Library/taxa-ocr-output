DISCUSSION
When labeled, isolated chloroplasts are incubated in the
supernatant of Cfragile homogenate there is no greater release of
fixed carbon than occurs in control medium incubation. This could
suggest that the mechanism for release of photosynthate in intact
Cfragile is lost when the alga is homogenized. Alternatively, it is
conceivable that no such release factor is synthesized by C fragile
Le., the intrinsic release rate of photosynthate is sufficient to meet
the plant's needs. An informative experiment would be to determine
whether the time course of release of photosynthate from
chloroplasts incubated in Cfragile homogenates is similar to that
in control medium.
The experiments with Ehedgpethi show no evidence for the
presence of a photosynthate release factor in the homogenates of
the starved animals nor in the homogenates of the re-fed animals.
However, previous reports indicate that such a factor is found in the
homogenates of E viridis (Trench et al. 1973b). Evidence for the
presence of such a release factor in Ehedgpethi is presented in a
recent study done by Francis Glaser (unpublished) who reports an
increase in the amount of photosynthate released from chloroplasts
incubated in E hedgpethi homogenates over the values demonstrated
by control medium incubation. From these experiments ! conclude
that the release factor is synthesized only when chloroplasts are
present in the digestive diverticulum of Ehedgpethi and f√ºrther,
that this release factor is broken down when chloroplasts are lost
from E hedgpethi upon starvation.
It is possible that more than 7 days are required for the
