temperature stress, they speculated that tall, less insulated barnacles had more internal space for
gonad development and were therefore more fecund.
In this study we examined the possible adaptive advantages conferred by the variety of
morphologies we observed in the field. We did this by quantifying the morphological variation
between sites that differed in temperature regimes and predation pressure and by experimentally
manipulating barnacle morphology and evaluating subsequent susceptibility to predatory whelks.
Materials and Methods
We performed all of our field observations and experiments at two study sites in Pacific
Grove, California and Monterey, California between April and June of 2001. The first study site
was located on the wave-exposed northeast rocky shore of China Point at Hopkins Marine Station,
and the second was a short granite outcrop in the wave-protected harbor behind the Coast Guard
Breakwater. Both sites were primarily composed of large granite boulders. Tetraclita were
common in both sites. Nucella emarginata was abundant at the Hopkins site but entirely absent
from the Breakwater site. At each site, we measured spatial variability of barnacle morphology
and conducted a field experiment to examine the relationship of morphology and susceptibility to
whelk predation.
Transects
At each site we sampled morphological data from the center of Tetraclitaâ€™s vertical range.
At Breakwater, this height was approximately 0.7 meters above MLLW and at Hopkins, it was 1.5
meters above MLLW.
At each site, we laid out 10 meter transects parallel to the contour of the shore, and at each
meter we counted whelks within a square meter quadrat. We randomly placed a 0.25-m' quadrat
within each successive meter of transect. In each quadrat we sub-sampled barnacles in one lOcm
by lOcm subdivision of the large quadrat. We used calipers to measure the opercular depth, the
