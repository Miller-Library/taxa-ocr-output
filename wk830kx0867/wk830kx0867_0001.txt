Abstract
The barnacle Tetraclita squamosa rubescens exhibits a high degree of variation in its shell
morphology. Research on other barnacle species suggests that a variety of factors, particularly
whelk predation and temperature stress, may influence the nature of this morphological variation.
By sampling T. squamosa rubescens in several sites in Monterey and Pacific Grove, California,
we established that barnacle morphology varies significantly with respect to whelk predation and
the vertical orientation of the barnacles' substrate. Barnacles are taller on vertical substrate, and
barnacles in areas of high whelk predation have more enclosed, recessed opercular plates. By
exposing whelks to barnacles with artificially exposed opercular plates in caged experimental
treatments, we found that the whelks preferentially prey on barnacles with exposed opercular
plates. Our predation field experiment corroborates the field sampling data insofar as the exposure
of the opercular plates decreases with increased whelk abundance, and decreased exposure of the
opercular plates significantly decreases the risk of whelk predation. Moreover, by measuring the
heat flux through barnacles with different shapes, we ascertained a significant difference in the
temperature budgets of taller, narrower barnacles versus barnacles with a shorter, broader shape.
It appears that barnacles with tall, narrow shells shed heat to the air more rapidly. These
observations and experiments support the hypothesis that the shell morphology of the Tetraclita
barnacle has significant effects on its susceptibility to predation and temperature change.
