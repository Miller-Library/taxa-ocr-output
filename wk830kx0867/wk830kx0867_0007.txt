difference in relative heights between horizontal barnacles at Hopkins and vertical barnacles at
the Breakwater. Of the 200 barnacles we measured at the Breakwater, only 12 were found on
horizontal substrate. Because of this small sample size, we did not include these barnacles in any
of our data analysis.
Vertically oriented barnacles at Hopkins had significantly smaller values for the
opercular exposure index than either barnacles on horizontal substrate at Hopkins or vertically
oriented barnacles at the Breakwater (ANÖVA, P 0.005; Table 1B, Fig. 2). There was no
significant difference between horizontal barnacles at Hopkins and vertical barnacles at the
Breakwater (ANOVA, PK 0.005; Fig. 2).
The frequency distribution of barnacle size (=estimated internal volume) were similar
between our two study sites, though the Breakwater had a few larger barnacles than Hopkins
(Fig. 3). The similarity of the size distributions at our study sites facilitates direct comparisons
of opercular exposure. Since the index increases with increasing barnacle size at both sites (Fig
4), if size distributions were not similar, direct comparisons of the index would not be possible.
Field Experiment
At Hopkins, Nucella consumed significantly more filed barnacles (two-factor ANOVA
and Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons, P « 0.005, Table 1C, Fig. 5).. This trend was also
present at the Breakwater, but the differences were not significant, possibly because so few
barnacles were drilled there. There was no significant difference between the control or
procedural control groups at either Hopkins or Breakwater (Table 1C).
Temperature Experiment
In our heat flux experiment, the short barnacle heated up at a faster rate than the tall
barnacle, and retained a higher internal temperature throughout the course of the experiment
(Fig. 6). The average heat flux through the tall barnacle was substantially larger than that
