related more to the size of the barnacle than its shape. Foster (1971) suggests that larger barnacles
are more insulated from heat stress. There may also be non-thermal forces at work. Wave forces
may favor shorter, broader barnacles, and this selective pressure may counteract, augment, or
override completely the predation and temperature effects (Crisp and Bourget, 1985). There may
be unobserved tradeoffs for one morphology versus another. For instance, a different morphology
may reduce fecundity, as Lively (1986) found with "bent" Chthamalus morphs. Further study is
necessary to distinguish the many physical and biological factors from one another.
Conclusion
Our field sampling data firmly established the existence of morphological variability
within Tetraclita living in Monterey Bay, California. Barnacles vary both in regards to their
relative height and the exposure of their opercular plates. Our predation experiment demonstrated
the importance of opercular exposure to susceptibility to whelk predation. Our temperature
experiment demonstrated that variation in a barnacle’s relative height has a significant affect on
the heat stress of the barnacle. However, we couldn’t conclude from our temperature data the
exact nature of the relation between shell morphology and heat stress.
