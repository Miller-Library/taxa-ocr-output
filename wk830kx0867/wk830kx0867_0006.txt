the substrate. Finally, we had a fourth thermocouple to measure air temperature at the rock
surface. In combination with the thermocouple inside the barnacle, the rock thermocouples
allowed us to determine the temperature gradient between the barnacle and the substrate. Using
the surface area of contact between the rock and the barnacle, we could then calculate heat flux
through each barnacle.
Temperatures were recorded every 5 seconds and then averaged over 5-minute increments.
The duration of the experiment was 4 hours. After approximately 2 and a half hours, we shaded
the barnacles for twenty minutes and then re-exposed them to sun to allow us to see how the
barnacles respond to different levels of insolation.
Data Analysis
Morphological measurements were compared between sites and substrate orientation using
a single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data from all transects were combined for this
analysis. Too few barnacles occurred on horizontal substrates at Breakwater to include in the
analysis, leaving Horizontal and Vertical at Hopkins and Vertical at Breakwater as the levels of
the single factor. The caged predation experiment was analyzed by two-factor ANÃ–VA, with each
cage as a replicate and Filed, Sham Filed, and Control as the treatment levels. Hopkins and
Breakwater were the two sites. All data were analyzed using Systat 8.0.
Results
Field Sampling
We found significant differences in the shape of Tetraclita at our two study sites (Table
1A, Fig. 1). At Hopkins, barnacles on vertical substrate had large relative heights (Fig. 1),
while barnacles on horizontal substrate had significantly lower relative heights (ANOVA, Pe
0.005). Barnacles on vertical substrate at the Breakwater also had significantly lower relative
heights compared to Hopkins vertical (mean = 0.784; SE =.016). There was no significant
