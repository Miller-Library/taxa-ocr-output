Figure Legends
Fig. 1. The relationship between relative height (= height / mean basal width) and
location
Fig. 2. The relationship between opercular exposure (= opercular width / opercular
depth) and location
Fig. 3. A histogram showing the size distribution of barnacles according to site
Fig. 4. A scatterplot relating the opercular exposure to barnacle volume. Opercular esposure (ÖW /
OD) is plotted on the y axis, and called REALÖW/OD
Fig. 5. The results from our predation experiment showing a significant whelk
preference for filed barnacles
Fig. 6. The temperature recordings taken during the four hour run of our temperature
experiment
