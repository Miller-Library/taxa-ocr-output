through the short barnacle (mean -O.14, SE 0.051; mean =-0.22, SE = 0.038). After 110
minutes, when substrate temperature, air temperature, and internal barnacle temperatures were
holding fairly constant (Fig. 6), we measured solar insolation at 925 W m-2, and calculated heat
flux from the rock to the barnacle at .167 W for the flat barnacle and .259 W for the tall
barnacles. At this constant temperature, we calculated the ratio of convective heat loss for the
flat barnacle to the tall barnacle as 0.709.
Discussion
The purpose of our study was twofold: first, to establish that there is variation in the
morphology of Tetraclita, and second, to determine the mechanisms by which the different
variations might be adaptive. By sampling barnacles at our two sites, we determined that
Tetraclita varies both in its relative height and in its opercular exposure index. There were
significant differences both between the two sites and between vertical and horizontal orientations
at Hopkins.
At Hopkins the barnacles exhibited significantly less exposed opercular plates than at
Breakwater. In our predation field experiment, whelks preferentially drilled barnacles with more
exposed opercular plates. Barnacles may thus benefit from having less exposed opercular plates in
areas of high whelk abundance such as Hopkins. The difference in the opercular exposure index
between two locations where whelk abundance varies suggests a potential "whelk effect" on
barnacle morphology. Lively (1986) demonstrated how whelks affect the development of
barnacle morphology via shape-changing chemical cues.
The predation experiment shows that predation pressure may select for less exposed
opercular plates. However, opercular exposure differs on a local scale within the Hopkins site,
where whelk abundance is variable but consistently high: Tetraclita on vertical substrate have
significantly lower opercular exposures than Tetraclita on horizontal substrate. Thus, a whelk
