Sugar glucose in Cryptochitons
concentrations from 3.7 to 11.7 mg%, with the lowest
values recorded in the Spring. The present study confirms
Tucker's very low spring glucose concentrations and, in
addition, indicates that the blood sugar level is quite
constant, both among members of the population and within
each individual. Martin (1966) notes a general constancy
in the blood sugar levels of other mollusks also.
A low blood glucose level probably is of adaptive
advantage to the chiton, since, as Martin (1966) notes,
most mollusks filter their blood for ufine production and
must then actively reabsorb any sugar present. However,
the very low supply of blood sugar also presents Cryptochiton
with the problem of adequately meeting its energy requirements,
since it does not appear to have a significant concentration
of any other reducing compound in its blood. The chiton
is often observed to exist long periods without eating,
so it must be able to mobilize energy stores, such as
glycogen, to maintain an adequate blood sugar concentration.
Itseems likely, especially considering the great stability
found in the sugar levels, that Cryptochiton possesses
some mechanism of active regulation to accomplish that
purpose.
To indicate further the existence of any regulating
mechanism, the response of the chiton to artificially
increased blood glucose levels was measured. It was
observed, as expected if Cryptochiton does indeed regulate
