Blood glucose in Cryptochitons
The results are summarized in Figure 2. The high initial
glucose values and the wide variation in the rate of the
response of the chitons was probably due to a lack of good
mixing since it was not always possible to place the
collecting catheter in a position of good circulation.
However, despite the variation, in each case the blood
glucose level clearly returned to a point well below that
expected from mere establishment of a passive equilibrium.
The blood of chitons 1, 2, and 3 returned to virtually
normal glucose concentrations, and it is expected that
chitons 4, 5, and 6 would have also had the experiment
been prolonged. No evident difference appeared.between
the chitons with the catheter in the haemocoel and those
with it in the pericardial cavity.
The water surrounding chitons 1, 2, 3, and 4 which
were kept in closed containers, was also tested for glucose
and, in all cases, less than 10% of the original glucose
injection was found in the water. Thus, decrease in blood
glucose could not have been due to excretion of glucose.
(c) Insulin Injection
Four Cryptochitons were injected with large doses of
insulin six hours after injection with glucose as described
in the pervious section. Two animals received a 20 units/kg
dose of insulin solution (13 units/ml) and two received a
