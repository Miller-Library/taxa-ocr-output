FIGURE CAPTIONS
Blood glucose concentrations found in male and
female Cryptochiton stelleri. Means and ranges
are indicated by horizontal lines, standard
deviations by boxes. x is value from one chiton
which was not included in calculating the mean.
Blood glucose response of six Cryptochitons
after injection of 311 mg glucose/kq. H:
sampling catheter in haemocoel. PC: catheter
in pericardial cavity.
Blood glucose response to insulin injected, in
doses of 20 and 200 units/kg, six hours after
glucose injection of 311 mg glucose/kq. H:
sampling catheter in haemocoel. LS: catheter
in lateral sinus.
