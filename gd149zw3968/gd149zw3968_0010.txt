Blood glucose in Cryptochitons
difference was found between the sexes.
2. After injection of large dosages of glucose, the
chitons were found to regulate their blood sugar levels
back to or near normal in 9 to 24 hours.
3. Crystalline bovine insulin, in doses of 20 units/kg
and 200 units/kg was found to have no effect on the blood
sugar concentration.
4. Norepinephrine and serotonin, in doses of 1 mg/kg,
were found to have no effect on the blood sugar concentration.

Dr. Frederick Fuhrman, for his ready advice and practical
cooperation. More importantly, his encouragement and
quiet enthusiasm was a real source of inspiration throughout
the project. In addition, I would like to thank Chris
Harrold for collecting the subtidal Cryptochitons.
