ABSTRACT
The blood glucose concentration of Cryptochiton stelleri
was found to be 3.5 + 2.0 mgs with no significant difference
between the sexes. The chitons were observed to rapidly
counteract increases in their blood sugar brought about by
glucose injection. In an attempt to elucidate the regulatory
mechanism involved in maintaining Cryptochiton's relatively
constant blood sugar concentration, the effect of infusing
vertebrate insulin, norepinephrine, and serotonin was
monitored. None of the hormones used appeared to have any
affect on the chiton's blood sugar concentration.
