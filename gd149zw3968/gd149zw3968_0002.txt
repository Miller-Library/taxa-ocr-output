Blood glucose in Cryptochiton
INTRODUCTION
Several investigators have found indications of
regulation of the blood glucose levels of mollusks
(Martin, 1966; Goddard, 1969). Although the concentration
of glucose in the blood of Cryptochiton stelleri
(Middendorff, 1846) has been measured (Myers, 1920; Tucker
and Giese, 1962), the ability of this species to regulate
has not been examined. Its large size permits serial
sampling of blood, and in view of this, studies were
undertaken on Cryptochiton stelleri in the Spring of
1974 at Hopkins Marine Station, first to determine the
normal glucose concentration in the blood, and then to
seek evidence for any regulatory mechanism. The results
clearly indicate a regulating response opposing changes
in the blood glucose concentration,
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Cryptochiton stelleri, ranging in size from 700 to
1500 g, were collected subtidally from the kelp beds just
off Mussel Point in Monterey Bay, California and kept in
large sea water tank at 13.5Â°C for one to two weeks before
use.
A single polyethylene catheter (PE 60) was placed in
each animal 12 to 24 hours before initiation of the experiment
and subsequent samples and injections were made through the
