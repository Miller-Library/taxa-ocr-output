Blood glucose in Cryptochitons
200 units/kg dose of a more concentrated insulin solution
(130 units/ml). The insulin used was Calbiochem bovine
pancreas insulin, recrystallized and assayed at 25.9 units/mg.
Figure 3 summarizes the results and indicates that the
insulin had no noticeable effect on the blood glucose level.
It did not increase the rate of fall of the blood glucose
concentration.
The lower glucose values for the two chitons sampled
in the lateral sinus probably result from good circulation
there which insures rapid mixing. In light of this result.
it might be advantageous in all similar future experiments
with Cryptochitons to use the lateral sinus for,injection
and sampling.
(d) Norepinephrine and Serotonin Injection
Norepinephrine and serotonin, each injected into four
Cryptochitons in doses of 1 mg/kg (1 mg/ml solution).
were found to cause no significant changes in blood glucose
concentrations during four to five hours after injection.
DISCUSSION
Blood sugar concentrations in Cryptochiton stelleri
have been observed by Myers (1920) who reported a value
of 41 mg%, and by Tucker and Giese (1962) who found
