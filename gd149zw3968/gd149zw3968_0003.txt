catheter. The catheter was inserted according to the
method of Martin et al. (1958), either dorsally between
the seventh and eighth valves into the haemocoel, or just
ventral to and between the fourth and fifth valves into
the pericardial cavity or lateral sinus. Some difficulty
was encountered in locating the catheter in the exact
desired position. Danger of puncturing the heart or missing
the lateral sinus, for example, could not be avoided and
could only be accounted for after each experiment when the
animals were dissected to determine sex and catheter
position.
Blood samples were analyzed for glucose aoncentrations
by the Glucostat method (Worthington Biochemicals Corp.).
an enzyme system specific for D-glucose. Analysis was
performed on 0.3 ml samples diluted with 0.7 ml of H»O and
with 0.5 ml each of 1.8% Ba (OH),-8H90 and 2.0% Zn (SOA):7H,O.
Total reducing power was determined on the deproteinized
blood by the method of Nelson and Somogyi (Hawk et al., 1954).
RESULTS
(a) Normal Blood Sugar Level
D-glucose concentrations in the blood of twenty-five
— thirteen males, nine females, and five of
Cryptochito
unknown sex — were determined during the month of May.
