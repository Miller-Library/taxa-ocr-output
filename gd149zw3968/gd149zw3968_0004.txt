Blood glucose in Cryptochiton
Although the chitons were grouped by sex, no significant
difference was found between the glucose concentrations
of males and females (PÂ£ 0.1 Student's T-test).
The results are summarized in Figure 1. One male
(glucose concentration of 35.6 mg%) differed so widely
from the mean that it was not included in calculating the
mean.
Twelve of the chitons were sampled two or three times
at intervals from one to twenty-hour hours and were found
to maintain reasonably constant blood glucose concentrations.
The average of the standard deviations for all these animals
was 0.6 mg%, and the largest standard deviation was 1.4 mg%.
Blood samples for three of the Cryptochitons were also
assayed for total reducing power, yielding values from
0.1 mg% above to 2.0 mg% below those for D-glucose,
essentially equal within experimental error. Therefore,
glucose is the major reducing component in the blood.
(b) Glucose Injection
Glucose solution (400 mg/ml) was injected directly
into the blood of six Cryptochitons in a doee of 311 mg/kg.
This quantity is sufficient to raise the blood glucose level
by 75 mg% on the basis of the blood volume reported by
Martin et al. (1958).
Blood sugar concentrations, before and after injection,
were measured in serial samples taken from each chiton.
