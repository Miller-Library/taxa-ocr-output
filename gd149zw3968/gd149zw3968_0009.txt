Blood glucose in Cryptochitons
respectively, However, such large dosages were required
that insulin probably plays a small role in any actual
regulating mechanism they might possess. The present
study indicates that even large doses of insulin have no
observable effect on the blood sugar concentration of
Cryptochiton.
Goddard (1968) found no effect from norepinephrine
or serotonin on blood glucose of Octopus dofleini.
However, Tiffon (1967) has elicited a rise in glucose
concentration upon injection of serotonin into the haemocoel
of Achatina fulica (Bowdich, 1822). The present study
indicates that neither norepinephrine norserotonin has
any effect on Cryptochiton blood sugar levels, at least
within five hours after injection.
The research reported here provides strong evidence
that a form of carbohydrate regulation exists in Cryptochiton
stelleri. However, much more work is needed to strengthen
these results and provide insight into the actual mechanism
of such regulation. Studies might include monitoring the
glycogen content after glucose injection as well as the
effects of molluscan tissue extracts.
SUMMARY
1. Blood glucose levels were determined for Cryptochiton
stelleri. The mean was 3.5 mg% + 2.0 mg% and no significant
