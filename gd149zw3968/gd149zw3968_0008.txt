Blood glucose in Cryptochitons
that the sugar concentration rapidly returned toward a
level near the original value without significant loss
of glucose to the surroundings. The glucose might well
have been deposited as glycogen for storage since Tucker
and Giese (1962) have found significant amounts of glycogen
present in the chiton. Barry and Munday (1959) have noted
a similar phenomenon of apparent regulation in Patella
vulgata (Linnaeus, 1849).
Although regulation of blood glucose in Cryptochiton
has not been studied previously, evidence for a possible
mechanism of sugar regulation has been sought actively
in other mollusks. Goddard (1969) has obtained the most
interesting results, having induced both hyperglycaemia
and hypoglycaemia in Octopus dofleini (Pickford, 1964)
with tissue extracts. Although the precise interpretation
of his results is somewhat unclear they provide a definite
indication that some functional hormonal control system
may be active within the mollusk for glucose regulation.
In addition, most of the vertebrate sugar-regulating
amines have been found in the mollusks. Many investigators
have tried, with mixed success, to record an effect of
those hormones, as well as insulin and glucagon, on the
sugar levels of mollusk blood.
Goddard (1968) and Kasinothan (1963) reported a
questionable hypoglycaemic effect of mammalian insulin
on Octopus dofleini and Meretrix casta (Chemnitz),
