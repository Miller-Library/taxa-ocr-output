INTRODUCTION
Mating in barnacles involves the transfer of sperm
via the penis from one animal to the mantle cavity of another.
The penis of a barnacle is a highly extensible and muscular
appendage arising medially between the most posterior cirri.
It may bear sensory setae at the tip (Crisp, 1954). Some
details of mating in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus balanoides : Exact'>Balanus balanoides</span> have been reported
by Barnes and Barnes (1956) and Clegg (1957), and in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. porcatus</span>
by Crisp (1954). There has not been a detailed description
of the process in most other species of acorn barnacles, and
there has been no account of the actual process of insemination
in any barnacle.
While cross-fertilization appears to be the general
rule in barnacles, and is obligatory in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. crenatus,</span> <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. modestus,</span>

MATING BEHAVIOR
The present study was carried out with B. glandula
and B. tintinnabulum maintained in laboratory aquaria provided
with flowing sea-water at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, during
April and May, 1967. The B. glandula used were collected on
mussel shells at Mussel Point and from pilings under
Fishermen's Wharf at Monterey, California. B. tintinnabulum
were taken from the underside of a float anchored off. the
Hopkins Marine Station. A few observations of copulation were
made on B. glandula growing on intertidal rocks on Mussel Point
heach during high tides on April 20 - 21, 1967.
TINNABULUM
BALANU
In B. tintinnabulum the penis is usually kept coiled
against the side of the body within the mantle cavity, and
during feeding, though the cirral net is generally fully
extended, no part of the penis is exposed to an observer.
Extrusion of the penis is co-ordinated with the extension of
the cirral net. During copulatory beating of the cirri, shown
in figure 1, B-D, the penis is slowly raised and uncoiled.
At the final beat the appendage is completely unrolled, as
in figure 1, E. When the penis is fully extended all the cirri
are also held rigidly extended and motionless. Retraction
of the penis is a fast, whipping motion accompanied by the
withdrawal of the cirral net.
The participants in mating, while hermaphroditic.
may be separated into donors, acting as males, and receivers,
acting as females. Pre-copulatory behavior begins with an
increase of activity on the part of the prospective donors
and a decrease in activity in the potential receiver. The
rate of cirral beat of donors varies from 1.5 to 3 times that
of a non-copulating, feeding barnacle. Receivers usually stop
feeding and remain with the operculum raised and opened and
the cirri pumping within the shell. If startled into closing
A. Wong Page 3
their opercula, potentially copulating animals resume their
activity much sooner than non-copulating ones.
The activities of a donor may be divided into three
phases: "exploration," probing and positioning, and finally
insemination. In the midst of feeding, a donor barnacle uncoils
its penis and waves it about in an exploratory manner. The
activity does not seem to be aimed at a particular target,
and the barnacle appears to be "searching" its surroundings
without a definite directional stimulus. Extrusion of the
penis may occur several times before feeding is resumed. If
at this point a target is located, probing begins and activity
thereafter appears directed toward the potential receiver.
Other barnacles close to the donor are ignored. Several donors
in a local area often probe toward one particular barnacle.
Thus while exploratory waving is always aimless, probing involves
a definite directional activity of the penis.
Sometimes, after several unsuccessful probing attempts,
the prospective donor will resume feeding, especially if the
receiver is too far away to be reached. If the penis can reach
the receiver, probing becomes more persistent and may continue for
several hours, interrupted only by short periods of feeding.
As the rate of copulatory beating increases, feeding interruptions
occur less frequently.
The pumping activity of the receiver is interrupted
also by short feeding spells during the long period of probing
by the donor. Often the probing penis comes into contact with
the receiver's extended cirri, and at first the former may
be startled into withdrawal. On further contact, this withdrawal
is no longer exhibited and the cirral net of the receiver
sometimes seems to draw the distal end of the donor's penis
into the shell. With the end of the penis inserted inside
the shell, the receiver often raises and rocks its operculum,
perhaps to adjust the position of the penis in its mantle cavity.
Finally, the operculum closes on the inserted penis and the
valves hold it tightly. Immediately thereafter the lumen of
3
A. Won
the penis is flooded with sperm which is clearly visible
externally as a crooked white line in the organ. Pinching
of the penis by the receiver's operculum may serve the dual
purpose of holding the organ in place during the deposition
of sperm and triggering the expulsion of sperm. It has been
noticed in dissections of barnacles that sometimes a pinching
of the penis with forceps may cause ejection of sperm. However,
experimental pinching of the extended penis in exploring animals
with fine forceps failed to cause ejection in repeated trials.
Insemination takes about 1 to 2 minutes, after which
the penis, still filled with sperm, is released and withdrawn,
leaving a trjal of sperm in the water. The donor resumes feeding,
and the receiver closes its operculum, rocking and rotating it.
Though several prospective donors may respond to,
and probe toward, a given receiver, only one donor copulates
with a receiver in B. tintinnabulum. Barnacles acting the
roles of donor and receiver simultaneously were never observed.
All potential donors which were opened before insemination
had occured possessed bulging seminal vesicles filled with
sperm, while potential receivers always had an abundance of
unfertilized, late ovarian eggs. After copulation, donors
usually still retained some sperm in their seminal vesicles.
Receivers which were opened about 10 minutes after insemination
were always observed passing ripe ova into the elastic sacs.
Usually, potential and actual donors were found to be brooding
ovigerous lamellae, although a few were found with only.early
ovarian eggs; none were seen bearing ripe ova. In the receivers,
the seminal vesicles were found to range from empty to bulging
full of sperm.
BALANUS GLANDULA
Mating behavior in B. glandula was observed to be
very similar to that of B. tintinnabulum except for the
following points. B. glandula does not have a rotatable,
beaked operculum and hance the receiver cannot actively position
322
A. Wong
the donor's penis after insertion. One to four donors simultaneously
in copula with the same receiver has been observed in B. glandula;
this has also been noted in B. balanoides by Barnes and Barnes
(1956). In B. glandula matings where a single donor was involved,
dissection of the donor after copulation showed that all the
sperm in the seminal vesicles was spent. Where there was more
than one donor, the seminal vesicles of each donor were still
partially full after mating. This suggests that the receiver
accepts only a certain amount of sperm. Crisp (1954) noted
that in <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. balanoides extra</span> sperm was ejected from the mantle
cavity of the receivers. In B. glandula, as in B. tintinnabulum,
most donors carried ovigerous lamellae, and receivers which
were opened after mating were observed to be passing unfertilized
eggs into the elastic sacs.
Copulation of B. glandula in the field was observed
once, on a rock which was gently washed by incoming waves.
The behavior was basically the same as that observed in the
aquarium except that the cirri were extended each time a wave
covered the rock, and the penis was uncoiled only when the
water was flowing in the direction of the receiver. The potential
donors were extremely active, exhibiting pumping action even
during moments when the rock was not covered. The receiver
also remained with the operculum open when exposed between
waves. Several times after the penis had been positioned
through the operculum of the receiver, waves washed it loose
and left it hanging down the side of its own shell. Even
under these conditions several nearby donors responded to
the receiver. During low tide, when the organisms were not
washed or submerged by the water, no activity was observed.

DIS
Since in both B. glandula and B. tintinnabulum,
animals engaging in exploration or probing with the penis
were always found to possess seminal vesicles bulging with
sperm, this appears to be a necessary condition for a donor.
A. Wong Page 6
However, as bulging seminal vesicles were also found in some
receivers and in some animals which did not exhibit donor
behavior, it is clearly not the only factor causing mating
behavior. The fact that most donors were brooding ovigerous
lamellae and some receivers had full or partly full seminal
vesicles suggests that individuals may play the roles of donor
and receiver alternately during the breeding season. No barnacles
were ever seen exhibiting both donor and receiver behavior
simultaneously. The behavior in the two roles is so different
that it seems mechanically impossible for a pair of barnacles
to fertilize each other simultaneously.
The clearly directional probing of donors toward
specific receivers in both species and especially the multiple
copulation of one receiver in B. glandula strongly suggests
that the receiver may produce an attractant which is sensed
by the donors and directs the penis to it. Prospective
receivers of both species always had ovaries filled with ripe,
unfertilized ova, a condition not found in any of the donors.
It is possible that ripe ova or some factors accompanying the
presence of ripe ova, provide the stimulus. Collier, Ray and
Wilson (1956) reported that ascorbic acid in low concentrations
produced copulatory responses in barnacles. Preliminary experiments
carried out on B. glandula and B. tintinnabulum using either
crushed, ripe ova or ascorbic acid under various conditions
failed to elicit a mating behavior. Several barnacles in aquaria
were noticed probing at exuvia; however, barnacles experimentally
presented with fresh exuvia usually showed no response. What
this means is not clear, but Barnes and Barnes (1956) have
suggested that there is an intimate connection between moulting,
copulation and fertilization, and noted that most barnacles
moult after fertilization.
Walley (1965) found that in B. balanoides insemination
stimulated extrusion of eggs into the elastic sacs. Present
observations on B. glandula and B. tintinnabulum indicate that
this occurs in these species as well.

in B. glandula and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dalli,</span> specimens of both species isolated
by different distances from their nearest neighbours were
collected at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California on rocks
approximately two feet above tidal datum during May and early
June, 1967.
A preliminary survey of B. glandula in close proximity
to one another was carried out to ensure that animals, of the
sizes to be sampled were sexually mature as evidenced by the
presence of ovigerous lamellae. Specimens with maximum basal
diameters of 6.0 + 14 mm were checked for the presence of
ovigerous lamellae. The results are presented below.

The data presented indicate little difference in frequency
of occurence of lamellae in animals of the size range shown.
All of the B. glandula subsequently collected had basal diameters
of 8 mm or more and are very likely to have reached sexual
maturity.
In the field, distance to nearest neighbour was
measured in terms of the shortest distance between the rims
of the opercula of the two animals before removal from the
substrate. In the laboratory, each individual was checked
for the presence of ovigerous lamellae. The data are plotted
in figure 3. None of the individuals separated by 7 cm or
more from their nearest neighbours carried ovigerous lamellae,
and less than 10% of the individuals 3-6 cm away from the
closest neighbour showed evidence of fertilization.
The above results suggests that the maximum reach
of B. glandula donors with a basal diameter of 8 mm or greater
was 6 cm. Since no barnacles isolated by more than 6 cm from
325
A. Wong Pag
their neighbours had any ovigerous lamellae, it appears that
self-fertilization does not occur in B. glandula, at least
at this time of year, despite the simultaneous maturation of
male and female gonads.
In studies on C. dalli, distances from the nearest neighbour
were measured in the same way as on B. glandula. Individuals
with a maximum basal width of 1-2 mm (at which size they are
sexually mature) were collected and checked for the presence
of ovigerous lamellae under the dissecting microscope. The
results, expressed in the same manner as for B. glandula, are
presented in figure 4. Animals 1-20 mm from their nearest
neighbour show a relatively high and constant percentage of
fertilization. A significant drop occurs between 20 and 25 mm,
and animals more than 26 mm from other <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. dalli bore</span> no ovigerous
lamellae. It appears the C. dalli can extend its penis to
reach another animal separated from it by a distance equal to
at least 12 times the basal diameter of the shell. It also
seems probable that C. dalli does not self-fertilize, at least
at this season.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I wish to thank Dr. D. P. Abbott for his advice and
help throughout the research and in the writing of this paper,
and all fellow students of the 1967 class of 175h at Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California
for encouragement and use of specimens.
SUMMARY
1) During copulatory activity, functional male barnacles (donors)
are much more active than functional females (receivers).
The rate of cirral beat when the penis is partially extended
is 1.5 to 3 times faster than that in normal feeding animals
under the same conditions. When the penis is completely
extended, the cirral net remains outstretched and motionless.

3) Activity of the donor can be divided into three phases:
exploration, probing, and insemination.
4) Exploratory activity consists of an apparently aimless
waving of the penis in the water. Probing action of the
penis, which often follows a period of exploration, is
directed toward a particular receiver, suggesting secretion
by the latter of some stimulating substance.
5) Probing terminates with insertion of the organ into the
mantle cavity of the receiver. During insemination, pinching
of the donor's penis by the opercular valves of the receiver
holds the organ in place, and perhaps acts as a trigger
which sets off sperm ejection by the donor.
Prospective donors always has seminal vesicles bulging
with sperm while receptive barnacles always possessed large
numbers of unfertilized, ripe ova.
7) Immediately after insemination has occured, ovarian eggs
are passed into the elastic sacs, which protrude into the
mantle cavity.
The maximum reach of B. glandula with a basal diameter of
8 mm or more is 6 cm; for C. dalli of basal diameter 1-2 mm,
the maximum reach appears to be about 25 mm.
9) B. glandula and C. dalli probably do not self-fertilize,
at least during April and May.
