Acknowledgements
I would like to express my thanks to the faculty, staff
and students of Hopkins Marine Station for their support,
guidance and enthusiasm at all hours of the day and night;
to Luigi, who had me on the other end of the aspirator sucking
up collembolids; and to Ellen, a knowing smile. To Dr. Robin
Burnett goes my very deepest appreciation and heartfelt thanks
for his advice, patience and faith in me and the collembolids.
