pattern, which can be recorded easily and accurately. The beach
collembolid is particularly well suited for such studies because
it spends its entire life cycle in the beach habitat which is
generally predictable, homogenous, and reproducible in the lab
so that populations survive well under laboratory conditions.
Therefore, the investigation of the littoral collembolid as a
model subject for clock studies has generated the extensive data
discussed here.
