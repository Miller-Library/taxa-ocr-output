Summary
Investigations of the rhythmic jumping activity of the
intertidal collembolid A. besselsi has resulted in the following
findings:
(1) A circadian rhythmicity is present which indicates a
sensitivity to the light-dark cycle of the solar day.
(2) The free-running period for this rhythm is approximately
23.8 hours.
(3) Different light regimes cause the rhythmic pattern to
phase advance and delay in different ways, showing that the
systems compensate independently addording to the particular
imposed light cycles.
(4) The circadian clock is entrained to a light-dark cycle
at a point in the cycle approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes before
dawn.
(5) Phase shifts in persistent rhythms seemed to vary as
a function of temperature.
(6) The circadian activity peaks and a set of smaller peaks
maintian a constant difference between their two periods, indi-
cating that the two rhythms are caused by separate endogenous
oscillators.
(7) A tidal clock may be the driving oscillator for this
smaller activity peak.
