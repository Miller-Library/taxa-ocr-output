or, the Normal and Delay cycle peaks will have the
same time relative to their dawns on the 13th day,
or June 6.
From the rate at which the peaks phase shift through
the day, the time of the peak on June 6 can be found:
Time of - [(time of peak

Day 5)
LD-Normal: A peak will arise 2.45 hours before its dawn
at 3:33 a.m.
LD-Delay: A peak will arise 2.60 hours before its dawn
at 11:24 a.m.
