stant conditions (see Table 2) shows a daily phase delay in
the first experiment of 27.6 minutes and 29.4 minutes for the
LL and DD regimes respectively. In Figure 3, best fit lines and
estimates of phase shifts were determined for the two periods
May 25-28 and May 29-Junel separately as indicated by the clear
shift in the peak mean at May 29; in each case there was a phase ad-
vance, the first by 5.7 minutes and the second by 13.2 minutes
per day. Whether these phase shifts are significantly dif-
ferent from each other can be determined by the F-test for the
difference between two regression coefficients (Box 14.8, Sokal
and Rohlf, 1969). This test showed that (1) the discontinous
phase delays in the second experiment were very similar, (2) the
phase shifts in LL and DD conditions (in the first experiment)
are remarkably alike and (3) among all four groups, the phase
shifts are significantly different from those in the second ex-
periment. Since the only obvious difference between the first
and second experiments was the temperature at which they were
run, this suggests that perhaps the oscillator in question is
temperature labile.
Nevertheless, that activity corresponds with dawn, an
obvious reference point in the daily cycle, and that the aver-
age natural free-run period calculated from the LL regime in the
second experiment is 23.8 hours, indicate that the oscillator
in question is a circadian one.
It is well to note here that in comparing the activity
pattern of the populations run in LL against DD, the absolute am-
plitudes of the peaks are greater in LL, indicating a higher num-
ber of animals active per hour, and having no apparent effect on
the pattern of rhythmic behavior. There are several possible ex-
planations for this: (1) a possible greater number of animals in
LL; (2) the greater activity found in LL is a function of the
slightly higher temperature associated with the light; or (3) the
animals could simply be more active in the light. Comparing the
LL populations in the two experiments with each other, the average
peak amplitudes are also different, the probable cause once again
being a different sample size, or the variable temperatures in
each experiment (air temperatures were 18 degrees Centigrade and
