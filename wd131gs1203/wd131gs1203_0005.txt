the sand in the container was originally moist, the container
itself was closed, and there was a relatively small volume of air,
the humidity inside was probably very nearly constant. The
entire bath opening was then insulated by a snugly fitting box,
lined with styrofoam.
Analysis of the hopping activity was accomplished by placing
small photorelays (Townsend, 1977) 1/4 inch above the sand where
and individual c√®llembolid interrupting the beam of light would
decrease the amount of light impinging on the detector, resulting
in a voltage change which was then amplified to activate a record-
ing pen on an Esterline Angus event recorder. Each photorelay
was wired into a single channel on the event recorder, and cor-
responding to each was a separate channel that counted the peaks
in multiples of ten, to facilitate counting.
The first experiment consisted of exposing two populations
to constant conditions, one experiencing constant light (LL) and
the other constant dark (DD). In the second set of experiments,
five populations were established. One was run in constant light,
two duplicate containers were subjected to a light-dark cycle of
14 hours of light and 10 hours of dark to closely mirror the solar-
day light cycle (LD 14:10 "Normal") and the last two populations
were run as duplicates exposed to a light-dark cycle delayed by
about 8 hours from the natural light cycle (LD 14:10 Delay) with
dawn arriving at 2 in the afternoon.
