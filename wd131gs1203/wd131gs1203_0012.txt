size of the peaks. Also, as well as simulating tides to investi-
gate the tidal Zeitgeber, when a high tide again coincides with
dawn, speculations as to its shifting effect in constant light
conditions might be checked. Lastly, numerous studies may be made
to determine the exact mechanism of how the clock-driven rhythm
is adjusted to the LD cycle, by determining a phase-response curve
and evaluating the magnitude of the phase shifts produced by a
given stimulus.
