clumps of the tube worm Phragmatopoma caljfornica. Above the algae zone is the
Tetraclita zone, extending from 1.5 to 4 feet above MLLW, in which the barnacle
Tefraclita is the dominant species. Mussels (Mhtilus caljfornianus), and limpets (Lotia
paradigitalis), occur in the upper parts of this zone, and Phragmnatopoma and other tube
worms are found in the lower parts. The highest zone occupied by Ocenebra, the
Chihamalus zone, extends from 3 5 to 6 feet above MLLW and is composed mosty of
the acorn barnacles Chthamalus sp. and Balanus glandula, as well as several species of
limpets (Macclintockia scabra, and Lottia paradigitalis)
Ocenebra Feeding Habits
Criteria for feeding in this study was evidence of drilling into the prey item, or
seeing the snail's proboscis extended to consume the prey item. Because L was not
always able to see a hole or the proboscis, a secondary set of criteria to determine feeding
was developed. One secondary and not always conclusive indicator of feeding in
Ocenebra was strong adhesion to the prey item, which usually accompanied drilling or
feeding. However, this behavior was also exhibited by non-feeding snails during dry
afternoon low tides, which may indicate that it is not solely a predatory behavior.
Remaining with a prey item for 2 or more consecutive days was also interpreted as
feeding.
Population Average
Information on the average diet of the Ocenebra population was gathered by
placing sixteen O.25m' quadrats in areas with three or more Ocenebra. Feeding status
and prey choice of Ocenebra were recorded, and estimations of prey species abundance
by percent cover for species in high concentrations, or by number of individuals for less
