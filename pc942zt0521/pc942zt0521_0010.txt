Another explanation for differential localization by individuals is based around
genetie diffrences between Ocenebra in different zones, It is posible that individuals in
ine Chuihamalus zone have genetically increased tolerance for desiccation or temperature
stres, and thus localiae to the Chuthamalus zone to avoid competition for resourees or
exposure to predators. If this is the case, individuals simply consume prey acording toits
avallability within their zone. Hughes and Taylor(1997) found that doguhelks Oucela
lapilus) from different populations have slightly different shell morphologies. This
genetically transmitted trait corresponds with the amount of wave exposure the
population experiences. Whether Ocenebra at Hopkins Marine Station is composed of
two or more genetically variable sub populations with one population localizing to the
Tefraclita zone, and one to the Chthamalus zone remains to be examined
Variation in Ocenebra feeding behavior also occurs. Ocenebra were observed
attacking Teiraclita in two ways: by drilig into the side of the bamnacle, and by priging
open the opercular plates. These two methods of handing prey were observed at
approximately equal frequencies both in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratorÂ¬
tanks, however, individuals never drilled all the way through the barmacle shell wall.
Several individuals had an established patter of drilling first, and then consuming the
Tefraclita by prizing open the opercular plates. This pattern remained relatively
consistent over several feeding cycles. In the field, the frequency of success after drilling
through the side of the Tetraclita shell is unknown. Two barnacle shells were found with
holes drilled completely through by Ocenebra, evidence that it is possible to drill hrouch
the side ofthe shell. Ocenebra may be learning how to feed more efficienty by handling
prey in different ways. Further observations of Ocenebra may show an increased
