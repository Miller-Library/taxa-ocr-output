individual's presence on a prey item for more than a day, and was confirmed by evidence
of drilling into the shell or of loose opercular plates in barnacles,
RESULTS:
Ocenebra were observed in the field handling and consuming prey, inchuding
lefracita quamosa, Chuihamalus spp, Balanus glandula, Lotia paradigialis, Abtilus
caijornianus, Phragmatopoma caljfornica, as wellas several other unidentified ube
worms. This information is based on 156 snails observed, 44%6 of which were feding.
Ocenebra atack prey both by drilling with the radula through the prey's shell as wellas
by reaching through the opercular plates of barnacle species. The proboscis is then
everted into the hole and the flesh of the prey is rasped out. A behavior characteristic of
feeding is wrapping the foot around part of the prey item, allowing the radula to serape
between the edges of the foot.
Data collected from quadrat studies of Ocenebra shows a correlation betwueen
Ocenebra prey choice and abundance of the prey item in the field (Table 1). Tetraclig
and Chihamalus, which combine to make up 85%6 of Ocenebra's diet, are consumed at a
frequency nearly equivalent to their relative abundance. This may indicate that Ocenebra
are feeding at random, consuming prey in the abundance at which it occurs. Some of the
less common prey species are not consumed at their abundance in the field. Despite its
relatively high concentration in the Chthamalus zone, the limpet Macclintockia scabra
was not observed as a prey item of Ocenebra in the field (Table 1), yet laboratory
experiments show that M. scabra is indeed consumed by Ocenebra (see below)
Ocenebra observed in the study site seemed to show consistency in prey choice.
Of 26 marked snails, 9 were observed through 2 to 4 feeding cycles (Table 24). Each of
