ABSTRACT
Foraging behavior of Ocenebra circumterta, an abundant predatory gastropod in
the intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station, was studied. Ocenebra in the field were
observed consuming barnacles, small limpets, tube worms, and mussels, with two
barnacles, Tetraclita squamosa and Chthamalus spp. composing 85% of their diet. As a
population, Ocenebra appear to consume prey proportional to its abundance in the field
This is consistent with random prey selection. However, snails marked and monitored
over Ã  five week period through 2 to 4 feeding cycles showed consistency in prey choice
that differed from the population average. Prey items chosen by each individual were
also consistent with a particular vertical zone in the intertidal.
Ocenebra occur vertically from the subtidal to approximately 45 feet above Mean
Lower Low Water (MLLW). This range encompasses 3 major zones, divided according
to domination by algae, Tetraclita, or Chthamalus. Marked snails remained within the
vertical zone corresponding to their choice of prey at a much higher rate than would be
expected if the individuals moved about randomly. Two possible conclusions are that
Ocenebra stratify according to prey type in a given vertical zone, or that Ocenebra
stratify for non-foraging reasons. Evidence for the former is that in laboratory tanks with
4 types of prey items, all 8 individuals monitored throughout 3 to 5 feeding cycles chose
prey consistent with a specific zone in the intertidal. This could imply that learning.
conditioning, or genetic variation in present in Ocenebra circumtexta, and could lead to a
competitive advantage over other predatory snails in the intertidal.
