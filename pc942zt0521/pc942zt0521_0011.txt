tendency to attack through the aperture of subsequent Tetraclita meals after
unsuccessfully drillig and then succesfiuly prizing open the opercular plates. Dunkin
and Hughes (1984) studied dogwhells experienced with barnacles, and doguhelks
inenpersenced vith barnacles, finding that more experienced indviduals priged open the
opercular plates, whereas inex perienced snails tended to drillthrough the sides of the
barnacles, until they learmed that prizing open the opercular plates is more eficient
Increased observations could lead to conclusions about this aspect of feding in
Ocenebra,
This study provided preliminary data on habitat preference and prey selection in
Ocenebra. More data will allouy better conclusions about Ocenebra behavior and the
correlation between zone preference and prey choice.
