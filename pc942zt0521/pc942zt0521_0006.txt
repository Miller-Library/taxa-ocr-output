Marked Individuals
1 marked 26 snails in the vertically stratified study site, mostly in the Tetraclig
zone. Aseries of thre colored nail polish stripes allowed identification of individual
snals throughout the study period. Nail polish occasionally had to be reaplied but was
relatively hardy in the field Marked snails were observed almost daily at low tide fora
makimum of 28 observations over a S-wek period. Feeding behavior at the time of
observation as well as snail location on a map of the study site was recorded
Nine additional Ocenebra initially observed in the Chthamalus zone of the study
site were also marked and observed to assess whether snails move randomly throuch their
habitat, or whether individuals localize to a particular zone. Snail positions were
recorded during 10 observations at low tide over a course of 2 weeks
Laboratory Study
Laboratory tanks were set up to examine individual prey choices in a controlled
environment where snails had a known composition and density of prey. Four replicate
tanks were establis hed containing 8 randomly selected Ocenebra in each tank, and knoun
relative abundance of 5 prey species. The number of these individuals was converted
into percent cover of each prey species as described previously, and calculated relative to
total prey cover in each tank. Prey species included (with relative abundance by area
cover in parenthesis) Tetraclita (64%), Chthamalus (8%), Lottia paradigitalis (690).
Macclintockia scabra (7%), and Mytilus californianus (19%). Laboratory tanks were
monitored daily to record behavior of each Ocenebra. Individuals were handled as little
as possible, to minimize disturbance. Therefore, feeding was usually determined by an
