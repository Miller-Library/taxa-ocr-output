these appeared to choose prey consistent with one of the three habitat zones. Snails l.2.
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 ate Tetraclia and Phragmatopoma, which are both found in the
Tefraclia and algae zones. Snail ? consumed both Tetraclita and Chuhamalus, found on
he border betwen the Chhamalas and Tetraclia zones. Italso appears that indviduals
are not choosing prey consistent with the average population of Ocenebra (Table 28)
A map of snail movements through the study site shows the localization of
particular individuals to certain zones (Fig. 1). The zone individuals stratifuy to also
corresponds with their prey choice (Table 34). If snails moved randomly throuch the
study site,20%0 of the time they should be observed in the Chhamalus zone, 40%6 of the
tume in the Tetraclita zone, and another 40% of the time in the algae zone. Based on
snail locations during low tide, this is not the case (Table 3). The map of snail
movements (rig. 1)also shows the vertical and horizontal distance that several Ocenebra
traversed Snail 8 has a wide vertical range, extending from the lower boundary of the
Tefraclita zone, to the upper boundary, a distance of about 3 feet. Snail 9 shous a pattem
of horizontal movement, ranging over 6 feet yet remaining within the Tetraclita zone.
These data show that Ocenebra are not limited to a given habitat zone simply by their
mability to traverse the distance into another zone. Individuals who ranged far across one
zone and didn't venture into another zone show evidence that some individuals may
localize to a particular zone. Ocenebra marked in the Chthamalus zone also exhibit this
strong tendency to remain within one zone (Table 3B)
In the laboratory tanks, individuals tended to choose prey consistent with a zone
in the intertidal (Table 4). Prey items are not chosen by individuals acording to relative
abundance in the tanks (Table 4B). Snail l ate only Chthamalus and M scabra, both
