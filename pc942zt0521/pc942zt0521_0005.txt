abundantspecies were made. The numbers of indvidual prey items per quadrat uere
translated into percent coverage of the quadrat surface area. Iasumed a circular shane
for the base of barnacles and limpets, and used a mean base diameter gathered from
sampling 20-30 organisms to calculate basal surface area for an individual. This
information was then translated into total surface area coverage and percent coverage by
each prey species. Data for individual quadrats was averaged to characterize the
intertidal habitat where Ocenebra are found. The average percent cover for each species
was divided by the sum of all available prey by percent cover to yield relative prey
abundance for each species.
Study Site
Studying individual snails was necessary to discover whether interindividual
differences exist in prey choice, or whether individual snails conform to the population
average. Ioriginally selected two field sites in the rocky intertidal of Hopkins Marine
Station for their high abundance of Ocenebra, as well as their accessibility during loy
tide. One of these study sites was later dropped, as it lacked the vertical range of the
other sfudy sife and snails dispersed too far from the original study area to relocate
reliably.
The remaining study site was divided according to species composition into the
three zones mentioned previously (algae, Tetraclita, and Chthamalus zones), and percent
cover of each zone estimated. I found that the algae zone and the Tetraclita zone each
spatially cover 40% of the Ocenebra habitat in the study site. The Chthamalus zone
composes the remaining 20% of the Ocenebra habitat in the study site
