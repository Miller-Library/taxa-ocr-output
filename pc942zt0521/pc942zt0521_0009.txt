found almost solely in the Chthamalus zone. Snails 2, 3. S, and 6 consumed only
Teraclia, consistent vith the Teraclia or algae zone. Smais 4 and 7 chose prey found
in the intersection between the feraclita zone and the Chhamalus zone. Althouch these
data are not conclusive because the original location in the interidal of the Ocenebra
prior to placement in tanks is unknoun, it does appear that the individuals are choosing
prey consistent with a particular zone in the intertidal.
Cumulatively, these data seem to indicate that individual Ocenebra localige to
parnicular zones in fhe intertidal, and that they consume prey consistent with a particular
zone in the intertidal. This corelation is further examined in the discussion
DISCUSSION:
Observations of Ocenebra circumteria indicate that individuals tend to consume
prey consistent with a specific intertidal zone, and that Oeenebra localize to a particular
zone in the intertidal at a much higher frequency than expected if individuals moved
fandomly. This is true for individuals marked in both the Tetraclita zone as wellas the
Chthamalus zone.
There are several explanations why individual snails localize to particular zones
The first possibiliy is that Ocenebra stratifj acording to prey assemblages in different
zones. Burrows and Hughes (1991) found that doguhelks (Nucella lapilie) transplanted
between sites with different prey availability retained a slight preference for their original
prey type. The preference, he suggested, is largely a reflection of prey availability at a
snail's original site. Similarly, Ocenebra may remain in certain localities based on prey
assemblages. This may imply that Ocenebra learn to prefer one prey over another, then
localize according to this preference.
