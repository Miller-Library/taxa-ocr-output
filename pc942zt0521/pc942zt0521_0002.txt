INTRODUCTION:
The intertidal zone is stratified into many different microhabitats. Lower regions
on the shore are submerged a high proportion of the time, providing a habitat for species
susceptible to desiccation such as tube worms and various algae. High intertidal zones
may be exposed to air for a longer time than they spend submerged. This harsher habitat
selects for species with a variety of traits, including the ability to resist desiccation
(Ricketts et al. 1985).
Some species have a range encompassing more than one intertidal zone be√ßause
they are able to withstand the various stresses accompanying different zones. As a
species, these habitat generalists often consume more than one type of prey. Two
extreme possibilities exist with regard to prey choice among species found in more than
one zone. Individuals may truly be habitat generalists, travelling across all zones in the
species range and consuming many different types of prey. Alternatively, it is possible
that individuals specialize on a subset of the species diet, leading to interindividual
differences in prey selection and stratification corresponding to prey abundance. Grant
(19/1) explored this concept as it relates to birds, pointing out that populations can be
composed of members that" differ in their modes of exploitation, being either specialists
or generalists" or "individuals that are similar... and are all generalists." The only way
to distinguish between these two possibilities is to observe individuals.
West (1986) found that interindividual variation exists within a population of the
predatory gastropod, Nucella emarginata. Individuals in her study consistently chose the
same type of prey, bypassing some prey species and actively selecting others. She
suggests that learning or genetic conditioning may occur in N. emarginata. Hughes and
