Dunkin (1984) showed learning to be the basis of these interindividual differences. In
their study, Nucella lapillus, another predatory snail species, was maintainted on one type
of prey for 60 days and subsequently showed a preference for that prey. This type of
learning may occur in the field, as well.
Ocenebra circumtexta, a predatory gastropod, has recently increased in
abundance at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. Ocenebra are
commonly found in several zones of the intertidal, ranging from Mean Lower Low Water
(M.I.W) to 16 above MLLW. This range encompasses several distinct microhabitats
with different prey assemblages in each zone
Ocenebra circumterta is not a widely studied organism. Another gastropod of the
same genus, Ocenebra lurida, consumes mainly limpets and barnacles, and occasionally
mussels (Palmer, 1988
This study examines population as well as individual prey selection in Ocenebra.
and differences between the two. I also explore movement patterns of individuals
between zones in the intertidal, and the correlation between movement and prey choice.
The results indicate that there is indeed a correlation between prey choice and zone
localization by individual snails, and that variation in individual prey selection may exist
MATERIALS & METHODS.
Intertidal Habitat
I divided the Ocenebra intertidal habitat into three zones according to species
characteristic of each zone. The lowest zone, the algae zone, ranges from t2 fet above
Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) to the subtidal. This region is mostly covered by
fleshy algae, with scattered volcano barnacles of the species Tetraclita squamosa and
