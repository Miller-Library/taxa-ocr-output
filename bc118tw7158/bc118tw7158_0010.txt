Two additional series of experiments haveesatl
ater
completed in an effort to determine what portion of
the sensory apparatus is involved in homing behavior.
The first experiments, designed to determine the role
of the cephalic tentacles in homing, ereperformed at
Pebble Beach, San Mateo County, California in January and
February, 1967. In these experiments sixty animals were
marked in the customary manner and left for three days to
insure that the position marked was the home spot. Then a
small typewritten number was affixed to the shell of each
animal, and the same number placed adjacent to its home
using Duco cement. The animals were then brought into the
laboratory, where all were anesthetized in a solution of
magnesium chloride isotonic with seawater. Both cephalic
tentacles were then excised from forty animals, distal to
the eyespots. The remaining animals were uninjured and were
utilized as controls. All animals were then placed in a
salt water aquarium for a period of four to five days to
allow recuperation of the operated animals.
The animals were then returned to the beach during a
period of low tide, and placod within three to four centimeters
of their own homesites. The locations of the animals at the
end of 24 hours, or two high tides, were observed and are
summarized in table 4. Of those animals which could be
located at the end of the 22 hour period, 293 of the experi-
mental group had homed, as compared to 75% of the controls.
