JESSEE, WILLIAM F. (Hopkins Marine Sta. of Stanford Univ., Pacific
Grove, Calif., USA). Studies of homing behavior in the limpet
Aomaea scabra (Gould, 1846). The Veliger
Homing behavior of A. scabra (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia)
from rocky shores was studied in field and laboratory. Populations
residing 7.1 and 2.4 feet above mean lower low water showed no sig-
nificant differences in h√∂ming ability. All size classes above
5-6 mm. in shell length showed equal homing abilities; smaller ani-
mals often did not exhibit homing. Scrubbing the substratum with a
fiber brush, or treatment with 32% NaoH had no significant effect on
homing tendency. Chiseling of the rock surface caused a drop in inci-
dence of homing. This suggests that homing behavior is mediated throug
perception of the topography of the substratum, and is not a chemo-
tactic response. Removal of the cephalic tentacles reduced the ten-
dency to home, while removal of the eyes did not.--Author.
