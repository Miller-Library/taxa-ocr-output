1" wide around the homes of 25 animals. The topography of
the rock in this strip was totally changed. The animals
were then replaced 4 cm. from their homes, and outside the
chiseled area. Fifteen other animals were similarly dis¬
placed, but the topography of their surroundings was left
unaltered. This latter group served as a control. Within
24 hours only four of the 25 experimental animals had homed.
Seventeen of the 25 were not in their homes, the remaining
four having disappeared.
Some additional evidence suggesting the involvement
of topography in the homing mechanism was an experiment
performed with a small group of animals at China Point.
Seven animals were marked and displaced the customary 4-5
cm. from their homesites. A hammer and chisel were then
used to create a strip about 1" wide between the animal
and its home. As the tide came in, the animals were ob¬
served to move to the edge of the chiseled area, then
travel along the edge of this area until they reached its
end. At this point they resumed their travel toward the
homesite, six of the seven returning by the next low tide.
This reaction to territory made unfamiliar by alteration
suggests that recognition of some element of topography may
be involved in the homing mechanism.
