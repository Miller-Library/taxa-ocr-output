instance, could be such a factor. The probability that the
mechanism is indeed involved with topography is in good
agreement with the tentative results reported by Galbraith
(1965) on the mechanism of homing in Acmaea digitalis
Eschscholtz 1833 and Lottia gigantea Sowerby 1843.
The high percentage of animals which homed after
treatment of the rock with sodium hydroxide argues against
the possible use of some chemical agent as a homing quide,
as the concentrated alkalai would be expected to dissolve
to or denature any substances deposited by the limpets,
While other external factors, such as polarized light or
water currents, have not been ruled out, it is doubted that
the animal possesses the sensory equipment to utilize
such
highly variable sources for orientation. Work should,
however, be carried out to examine these possibilities.
The implications of a homing mechanism based on a knowledge
of topography, in an animal such as the limpet, demands
additional investigation.
