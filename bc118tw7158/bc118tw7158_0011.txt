The second series of experiments was performed at
Moss Beach, San Mateo County, during April and May, 1967.
and was designed to determine whether or not the eyespots
are utilized in homing. Sixty animals were marked and in-
dividually numbered as before. After the usual waiting
period the limpets were brought into the laboratory, where
all were anesthetized with the magnesium chloride solution.
A dissecting needle which had been heated to redness was
then employed to cauterize both eyespots on forty of the
animals, the remainder being utilized as controls. After a four
to sixday period of recovery in the aquarium all the animals
were returned to the field and replaced within three to
four centimeters of their homes as before. The positions of
these animals were observed at the end of 24 hours, and are
also summarized in table h.
The eyespot is apparently not utilized in homing. Exam-
ination of the four experimental animals which failed to
home indicated that in these, substantial damage had been
done to the cephalic tentacles. In those animals in which
no damage was observed, there was 100% homing.
The loss of the cephalic tontacles appears to have a
statistically significant effect on homing. This observation
is, however, open to question. It is a distinct possibility
that the decrease in the instance of homing was a result
of trauma or other factors. The fact that some 29% of the
experimental group returned to their homes despite the loss
of the tentacles seems to substantiate this possibility;
the presence of alternative systems which may be utilized
