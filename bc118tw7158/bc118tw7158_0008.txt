DISCUSSION
If populations at the high and low levels are studied
using animals of comparable size, there is no significant
difference in the homing ability of the two groups. Nor is
there any significant difference in the homing ability of
animals of different sizes at the same intertidal level.
These observations confirm earlier ones by Haven (1966).
However, it was also observed that animals of less than 5-6
mm. in length usually do not home. Such animals are found
mainly in the lower intertidal. The inclusion of these
extremely small animals in earlier studies of homing behavior
may account for some of the discrepancies in the findings
of this study as compared to these earlier works.
The results of the experiments designed to elucidate
the mechanism of homing suggest that it is related to the
perception of the topography of the rock surface in the
vicinity of the limpet's homesite. The fact that the ani¬
mals would not cross an area of unfamiliar topography, but
went directly home upon reaching familiar territory points
to a "memory" of the convolutions of the rock surface. It
is, however, possible that some other factor in the environ¬
ment which was not investigated is responsible, at least in
part, for homing. Light or its polarization pattern, for
