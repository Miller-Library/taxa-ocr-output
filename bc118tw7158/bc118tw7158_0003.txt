Ouof tho first stud on the Pacific species
of Acmaea, by Wells (1917), gives the impression that
homing is a highly individual trait, even among mombers

orithe single species A. scabra. However, the tendency
to home was apparontly not studied in moro than a few
esentatives of each spocios, and tho frequency of
20
ag behavior was not ovaluated.
To attem
ts at such an evaluation were subsequently
reported (Howatt, 1940; Villee and Groody, 1940).
Hewatt's study of thirty-ono A.
scabra on granite rocks
reveoled homing behavior in all thirty-one individ-
uals. On the other hand, Villeesand Groody comcluded
from their study of 86 members of this species on a
sandstomo substratum, that there was no ovidence for
homing behavior. This latter study, however, was roe
stricted to observations made principally as low tide,
a time when there is little or no activity in tho lim-
pot population. All animals that had not beem observed
away from their homosite during the period of study
ro ignored.
