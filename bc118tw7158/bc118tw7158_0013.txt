SUMMARY
1. Homing behavior of Acmaea scabra was studied in the
field with respect to the intertidal height of the popula-
tion, the size of the individuals, and the mechanism involved
in homing movements.
2. No significant difference was found in the homing
ability of populations in the high intertidal region as
compared to those at lower levels.
3. The size of the animals was found to be unimportant
in determining their ability to home, except that extremely
small animals, less than 5 to 6 mm. in length, were usually
found to be non-homing.
4. The possibility that chemical substances on the rock
surface are the agents of homing behavior appears highly
unlikely.
5. Although a few other environmental factors were not
coerimentally eliminated, the evidence presented indicates
that the topography of the rock surface is utilized in
homing by A scabr:
6. (From addendum) Excision of the cephalic tentacles

anificantly reduced the tendency to home, while destruction
si
of both eyespots had practically no effect on the incidence
of homing.
