placed randomly 3 - 4 cm. from their homesites. The other
twenty in each area served as controls. The animals were
observed after 24 hours, and as shown in Table 1, no signi¬
ficant difference was seen in the homing ability of the
high and low groups.
A similar experiment was then carried out in an area
of intermediate elevation, +3.9 ft., to compare the homing
behavior of large animals, greater than 15 mm. in length,
with that of small ones between 6 and 10 mm. long. Here,
too, no significant differences were observed, as can be
seen from Table 2. However, a less complete study suggested
that animals smaller than 6 mm. usually do not home.
Experiments in the laboratory, utilizing glass plates
over which limpets had been allowed to move, revealed no
residual mucus in the form of trails as determined by the
India ink test of Peters (1964). Nonetheless, field exper¬
iments were performed to investigate the possibility that
mucus or some other chemical substance on the surface of
the rock was the agent active in governing homing behavior.
In the first type of experiment, a stiff fiber brush
was used to scrub a 14" strip around the homesites of 20
previously marked animals. The areas surrounding 15 other
animals, which served as controls, were left unscrubbed.
All animals were then displaced 4-5 cm. from their homes
