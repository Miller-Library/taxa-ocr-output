compare this running data with the "historical record" of limpets at each site,
the shells of every limpet falling within the transect band was also observed
at the beginning of the study, and the percentage of damaged limpets per site
was counted. In addition, the length and width of each limpet within each
transect band was measured, and the surface area of each limpet shell was
calculated by approximating the shell's shape as an ellipse.
MEASURING MAXIMUM WAVE FORCE. To provide some measure of the wave
force of each day of the study, six maximum wave force meters (as designed
and described by Bell and Denny, 1994) were placed at Site 1. Their heights
varied from 5.35 ft to 9.35 ft above MLLW. These meters consist of practice
golf balls attached to springs, which are attached to the rock face. A rubber
indicator allowed for daily measurements of maximum spring extension,
which could consequently be converted into wave force and wave velocity
estimates, as described by Bell and Denny (1994).
MEASURING WAVE PROJECTILE ACTION. Measurement of wave projectile
action was conducted by placing styrofoam targets on the rock faces of the
study sites. The styrofoam targets were all cut from the same styrofoam board
to ensure consistency in stiffness and hardiness. Targets were square blocks
measuring 5 cm X 5 cm X 1 cm thick, creating a 25 cm2 target area. At least
one major face of each target was carefully smoothed to allow detection of
small impacts. Five targets were affixed to each rock face at each study site at
the mean height of the limpets using Splash-ZoneÃ« epoxy. Epoxy was
applied all around the edges of the target as well as under it, which helped to
prevent the edges of the target from chipping away due to wave action. Daily
observations were made of each styrofoam target, and the number of new
