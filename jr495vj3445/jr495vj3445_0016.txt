ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This project could not have been possible without the help and
patience of many people. Mark Denny waded through several drafts of this
paper and poked and guided the project into shape. Jim Watanabe, Brian
Gaylord, and Emily Bell suggested brilliant ideas and located obscure tools and
equipment that I needed. Steven Randle and Gi-Soo Lee braved ten-foot
waves and early morning chills to help me at 5 a.m. low tides.
Special thanks to Chris Harrold and the staff and volunteer divers at
the Monterey Bay Aquarium who offered their Kelp Forest Exhibit and their
Thursday afternoon to help an undergraduate student drop rocks in their
tank, and to explain to dozens of inquiring tourists that this was "real science
going on.
