expansion of the styrofoam. This precluded any accurate examination of
relative impact severity. From personal observation, however, the deepest
and widest impacts were recorded from sites 3, 5, and 7, which were the sites
with direct wave exposure.
LIMPET SHELL IMPACT MEASUREMENTS. The average-sized limpet (50.3 mm
length) could withstand a direct blow from the steel rod dropped from a
height of 32 cm + 10.99 cm (mean + sd, see Table 3). The first visible sign of
shell damage was most frequently chipping to the outer portion of the shell
(12 of the 15 cases). The other three limpets suffered hairline cracks
originating from the apex. The strength of the blow necessary to fatally
wound the limpet varied from 30 cm to 75 cm; however, even these
measurements are probably underestimates because of the shell weakening
already caused by previous shell damage.
