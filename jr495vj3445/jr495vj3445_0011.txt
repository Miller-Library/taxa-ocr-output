The deflection of incoming waves probably serves to deter wave-borne
projectiles through several mechanisms. The sudden bump in the rocky
floor may cause the wave to break sooner, affecting the ability or the timing of
the projectile "throw." Early breaking or deflection of the wave also causes it
to slow down, possibly decreasing the intensity and range of the projectiles.
Finally, offshore rocks or deflecting rock beds may be hit by the projectiles
first, serving to sift and shield more inshore rock faces from projectile hits.
While the frequency of styrofoam impacts at directly wave-exposed
sites was significantly greater than at deflected-wave sites, the fraction of
limpets experiencing new shell damage did not significantly differ between
the two types of sites. This indicates that other shell-damaging factors, such as
bird or crab predation, may be affecting one or both types of sites, and that
these factors can be as important as wave projectiles in causing limpet shell
damage. While wave projectiles may play a role in limpet survivorship, they
are clearly not always the dominant factor even at highly wave-exposed sites.
As a final confounding note, there are several unexplored factors that
determine limpet shell strength and susceptibility to shell damage. Lottia
gigantea frequently play host to rider limpets (probably McClinktockia scabra),
that piggyback on the shells of L. gigantea and etch an oval scar in the shell.
These scars remain even if the rider limpets fall off. L. gigantea 's cracks,
when observed in the field, tended to originate from these oval scars. This
implies that these rider limpets may cause some substantial shell weakening.
In the assessment of limpet shell strength, three of the limpet shells tested
contained rider limpets, and these three shells were also among those to be
damaged at the lowest impact energies. This further implicates a role for
these rider limpets in the survivorship of their hosts.
