impact severity needed to fatally wound a limpet. Wave projectiles can
therefore act in several different ways; they can merely "knock" the limpet's
shell, they can chip or crack the shell, increasing the limpet's susceptibility to
predation or desiccation, or they can deliver a fatal impact to the limpet.
While qualitative and quantitative data both suggest that increasingly serious
damage to limpets occurs increasingly rarely, these effects are still large
enough to be seen in the field over a short period of time.
