ABSTRACT
The effects of wave action on the dynamics of intertidal communities
are often modeled viewing seawater as a pure fluid. This assumption
overlooks the potential consequences of solid ocean debris, including rocks,
animal shells, and other hard objects, which can be "thrown" into the
intertidal zone at high velocities.
This study investigates the survivorship of the owl limpet Lottia
gigantea in relation to its bombardment by wave-borne projectiles. Over a
five-week period, the presence of new shell damage in 160 limpets was
recorded at seven different rock faces that received varying levels of wave
exposure and that contained varying levels of nearby rocks and debris. During
the same period, maximum wave force measurements were taken daily, and
Styrofoam targets placed at each rock face were used to record the projectile
impacts.
Wave projectile action at directly wave-exposed areas can play a
substantial role in the survivorship of L. gigantea. Limpets living on rock
faces at directly-exposed sites experienced substantial levels of wave projectile
damage on days with high wave action. Limpets living on rock faces that
experienced deflected waves or waves that "ramped" off lower rock beds were
significantly less affected by wave-projectiles. This suggests that the effects of
wave action on limpet survivorship can depend on the local topography as
well as the disturbance caused directly by hydrodynamic forces.
