INTRODUCTION
The ability of marine invertebrates to survive in the wave-swept
intertidal zone has led to many studies on how wave action affects the
abundance, life cycle, and mortality of these species (Ricketts et al., 1985;
Branch 1981; Denny et al., 1985). Though the consequences of hydrodynamic
forces on intertidal organisms has generally been well characterized, these
studies usually model seawater as a pure fluid. In reality, seawater may
contain solid ocean debris such as rocks, logs, and animal shells, and can
"throw" these objects into the intertidal zone through wave action (Dayton
1971; Shanks and Wright 1986). Given that water velocities upwards of 10
m/s have been measured on wave-swept shores (Denny 1985), it seems
plausible that a modest-sized object propelled at such speeds could injure or
kill intertidal organisms where wave action alone might not.
In the one major study on the effects of wave-projectiles on intertidal
organisms (Shanks and Wright 1986), the impact of projectiles on the barnacle
Chthamalus fissus and the limpet Lottia gigantea were studied. The study
concluded that wave action could "throw" rocks as projectiles, and that the
survivorship of organisms living in intertidal areas with loose pebbles and
rocks partially depended on the damage caused by wave-borne missiles. The
study also concluded that the effects of wave projectiles can vary within
microhabitats (rock edges vs. rock faces vs. rock tops).
The hypotheses and conclusions of the Shanks and Wright study,
while thorough, have not been re-tested or expanded upon in the past decade.
In their report, the authors noted several shortcomings of their experiments.
Importantly, they note that extensive tag loss during their study prevented
repeatable observations of the same limpets, and thus made qualitative
