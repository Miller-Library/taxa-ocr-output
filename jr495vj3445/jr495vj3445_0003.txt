measurements of survivorship in L. gigantea more difficult. In addition,
their limpet studies were conducted at only one location, San Nicholas Island
in southern California. The phenomenon of wave-borne projectiles has not
been experimentally confirmed and documented at other locations.
This paper describes an attempt to repeat the study of Shanks and
Wright at a separate location, as well as to examine several additional factors
not considered in the original experiments. My intent was also to provide
more quantitative data on effects of wave projectiles on survivorship of the
owl limpet Lottia gigantea using careful and extensive tagging, as well as to
record data more frequently than in the previous study. This paper also
considers aspects that control the severity and frequency of wave projectile
action, such as local topography, height above MLLW, and wave velocity.
