limpets should be cracked, in practice the estimates are not unreasonable. It
has been observed that limpets are capable of repairing cracks and chips to
their shells in less than 3 months (Shanks and Wright 1986; Bulkley 1968),
and with this ability, limpets could plausibly endure over 2 damaging hits per
year and still manage to look fully unscathed for several months in the vear
because of their rapidly healing shells. Transect data (Table 1) also indicate
that a substantial portion of limpets are damaged at any one time, ranging at
study sites to fractions up to 24.2%. Both these observations may account for
the high estimated incidence of projectile-mediated damage.
If one extrapolates this data further into the limpet's 15-year life span
(Abbott 1980), then the average limpet would expect 333 "hits" on its shell and
39 shell-damaging cracks over the course of its life. Even as an
approximation, this still represents a substantial influence on the life and
potential survivability of the organism. By extremely conservative estimates,
if the frequency of shell damage made in this and the 1986 study were both
erroneously a full order of magnitude too high and the average yearly wave
velocity were approximated at 3 m/s instead of 5 m/s (during the entire study
in May, even during relatively calm periods, there was never a period that
averaged below 3 m/s), then the average limpet would still experience at least
17 "hits" on its shell and more than a 50% chance for a single shell-damaging
hit sometime in those fifteen years.
These approximations have been made without any attention towards
the possible severity of limpet damage. By dropping the rod onto a control
piece of styrofoam from a height normally sufficient to deliver a completely
fatal blow to a limpet (as determined from the shell impact experiment), and
comparing the resulting dent to styrofoam impacts in the field, it became
apparent that some of the field impacts were qualitatively comparable to the
