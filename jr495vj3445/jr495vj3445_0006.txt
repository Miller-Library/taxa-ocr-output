impacts was recorded. Targets that were severely damaged were replaced as
needed.
SHELL IMPACT MEASUREMENTS. To measure the ruggedness of the limpet
shell, fifteen limpets were collected and tested. The size of the tested limpets
was approximately the same, and was equal to the average size of the tagged
limpets averaged over all the study sites (51 mm length). Limpets were
placed horizontally on a rigid metal surface. Impacts were generated by
dropping a 133 gram steel rod, guided through a PVC pipe, onto the center of
the limpet shell. The rod's end was spherical, with a surface area of 50 mm2.
The rod was dropped from increasing heights in 5 cm increments, and
measurements were made to note when the shell first cracked or chipped,
and when the impact was lethal. A lethal impact was one where the shell
was cracked severely enough to expose the soft body underneath, or where
the rod completely penetrated the shell. Successive rod drops began at
heights where previous limpets had begun to chip in order to minimize the
number of impacts given to each shell and to reduce the amount of
cumulative shell weakening during the experiment.
ROCK TERMINAL VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS. The terminal velocity of rocks
sinking through water provides some information on the minimal velocity
necessary for a wave to lift and propel the rock as a missile. To measure the
terminal velocity of rocks sinking in seawater, rocks of various masses were
collected from West Beach at Hopkins Marine Station, near study site 7. Each
rock was approximately spherical, and weighed from less than 1 gram to over
300 grams. Each rock was dropped in the Kelp Forest tank at Monterey Bay
Aquarium, Monterey, California, next to a taut vertical line marked with 1
