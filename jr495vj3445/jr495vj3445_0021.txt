TABLE 3. LIMPET SHELL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. A steel rod with impact area of
50 mm2 and mass 133.5 grams was dropped from increasing heights through a PVC pipe
onto the center of an L. gigantea shell. The first height that created visible limpet shell
damage (chip, crack, or lethal blow) was recorded and shown above. The corresponding
energy per square meter was also calculated and shown. The mean length of limpets tested
was 50.3 mm, and the standard deviation of sizes tested was 3.9 mm.
