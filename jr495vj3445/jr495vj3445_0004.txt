MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SITES. The measurement of wave projectile action was conducted at
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California.
The intertidal zone of Hopkins Marine Station consists of areas of increasing
wave exposure, from highly protected rocks to areas where waves break
directly on the rock face. Seven vertical rock faces containing substantial
numbers of Lottia gigantea were selected as study sites. Each site was
observed to experience substantial wave exposure. Three of the seven sites
experienced direct wave exposure during the majority of the tidal cycle. Four
of the seven sites were located in areas with partial deflection of incoming
waves or in areas where striking waves "ramped" off outlying rock beds. The
locations of the sites are shown in Figure 1, and characteristics of each site are
listed in Table 1.
TRACING LIMPET SURVIVORSHIP. The measurement of limpet shell damage
and survivorship was conducted by tagging 20 to 25 limpets at each study site.
At each site, the vertical extent of L. gigantea was visually estimated and a
horizontal transect across the rock at the approximate mean level of local L.
gigantea was marked. Twenty to twenty-five limpets were randomly chosen
that lived within one foot of the horizontal transect. Limpets were
deliberately excluded from the random sampling if they were already severely
damaged, or if they resided near a horizontal ledge, which would make them
susceptible to oystercatcher predation (Hahn and Denny 1989).
Each chosen limpet was tagged either using numbered Dymo-label6
tags affixed with Splash-ZoneÃ« epoxy, or with weatherproof paint. The shell
damage of each tagged limpet at each site was recorded every three days. To
