TABLE 1. CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDY SITES USED TO STUDY WAVE
PROJECTILE ACTION. Sites 3, 5 and 7 were subjected to breaking waves and
experienced primarily direct wave exposure. Sites 1, 2, 4 and 5 received primarily wave
splash, "ramped" wave exposure, or had waves deflected by other nearby rock faces. The
percentage of limpets damaged was calculated by observing all limpets across a horizontal
transect at each site. From personal observation, the amount of loose rocks and boulders
increased when moving from site 1 towards site 7.
