FIGURE 1. LOCATION OF STUDY SITES ALONG ROCKY INTERTIDAL ZONE
OF HOPKINS MARINE STATION, PACIFIC GROVE, CA. The numbered study
sites were all vertical rock faces located at the designated points along the intertidal zone
FIGURE 2. NEWLY-DAMAGED LIMPETS VS. WATER VELOCITY AT SITES
WITH DIRECT WAVE EXPOSURE. Correlation between measured maximum water
velocities of sample periods and the number of limpets with newly cracked or chipped
shells (r = 0.849, p « 0.05). The data shown are from sites with direct wave exposure
during the majority of the tidal cycle.
FIGURE 3. STYROFOAM IMPACTS VS. WATER VELOCITY AT SITES WITH
DIRECT WAVE EXPOSURE. Correlation between measured maximum water velocities
of sample periods and the number of styrofoam impacts recorded (r = 0.885, p £ 0.05).
FIGURE 4. TERMINAL VELOCITY OF ROCKS SINKING IN SEAWATER.
Measurements were made by dropping spherical rocks into the Kelp Forest tank in
Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey, CA. Rocks were dropped next to a taut vertical line
with marked 1-meter increments and allowed to sink 5 to 6 meters to achieve terminal
sinking velocity before speed measurements were made
FIGURE 5. STYROFOAM IMPACTS AND NEW LIMPET DAMAGE NORMALIZED
TO SURFACE AREA. The frequency of impacts on each is normalized to the number of
impacts per square meter. The surface area of each limpet was estimated by approximating
shell shape as an ellipse and measuring the semimajor (a) and semiminor (b) axis lengths,
with surface area equal to Hab.
FIGURE 6. THEORETICAL SHELL-DAMAGING PROJECTILE HITS PER YEAR
VS. WATER VELOCITY. This line is constructed from the surface area of a 50 mm long
limpet (1500 sq. mm surface area) and the least-squares regression line from Figure 2 to
give the average number of shell-damaging projectile hits a limpet would experience per
vear in relation to average yearly water velocity. By extrapolating the number of hits per
limpet surface area to the number of impacts per square meter, the number of hits per
square meter per day can be measured. Scaling this factor by the average limpet surface
area allowed the theoretical yearly impact frequency to be estimated.
FIGURE 7. THEORETICAL TOTAL PROJECTILE IMPACTS PER YEAR VS.
WATER VELOCITY. This line is constructed from the least-squares regression line from
Figure 3 and the surface area of the styrofoam targets to give the average number of total
shell impacts a limpet (50 mm length, 1500 sq. mm) would experience per year in relation
to average yearly water velocity.
FIGURE 8. THEORETICAL PROBABILITY OF A LIMPET RECEIVING A HIT
AFTER CONSECUTIVE DAYS. 10.7% of the limpets at directly-hit sites were damaged
over the period of 35 days. This allows an estimation of the number of new limpets
damaged per day. By subtracting this "hit" probability from 1, the probability of a limpet
escaping a hit after x consecutive days can be calculated. The projected estimates for the
first 365 consecutive days are shown above. The dashed line demonstrates that an average
limpet can survive 227 days before reaching the 50% probability of receiving a damaging
hit.
