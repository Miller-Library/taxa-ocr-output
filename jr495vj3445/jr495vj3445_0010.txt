DISCUSSION
There are many factors that affect the frequency of rocky debris being
"thrown" into the intertidal zone, and this inherent complexity leads to high
levels of variation when trying to measure the effect experimentally. The
results of this study confirm many of the sources of variability encountered in
the original 1986 study (e.g. wave velocity, local substratum relief). For
instance, Shanks and Wright noted that the frequency of projectile hits across
a single rock face can vary by several orders of magnitude, depending on
whether one measures the rock edge, rock top, or rock face itself. In more
than one instance in this study, two styrofoam targets separated by less than
two feet (both the same height above MLLW) experienced more than a five-
fold difference in projectile impact frequency.
This study further suggests that the frequency of wave projectile
impacts relies on macroscopic topographical factors in addition to very small
distance separations. If the limpets' rock face was protected by a rock bed that
partially impeded the incoming waves, there appeared to be a decrease in the
amount of projectiles "thrown" against this rock face as measured by the
styrofoam targets. The extent of protection did not need to be absolute nor
was it always immediately obvious; even rock beds that caused waves to
'ramp" off and crash into the limpets' rock face appeared sufficient enough to
reduce wave projectile impacts. Often, these "ramped" waves created a
greater visual perception of wave impact by generating loud breaking noises
and throwing up whitewater several meters into the air. In contrast to
appearance, though, the rock faces hit by these ramped or deflected waves
seemed less susceptible to projectile hits than more modest-sized waves that
struck rock faces directly.
