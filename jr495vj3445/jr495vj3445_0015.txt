CONCLUSIONS
The data from this study largely agrees with the information found in a
similar study conducted by Shanks and Wright (1986), and finds that 1) waves
"throw" rocks into the intertidal zone, 2) the intensity and frequency of these
wave projectiles positively correlates with wave velocity, and also depends on
macroscopic topography in addition to availability and size of projectiles, and
3) these projectiles have a real and detectable effect on health and
survivorship of Lottia gigantea.
