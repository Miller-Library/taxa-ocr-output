RESULTS
LIMPET SHELL DAMAGE AND SURVIVORSHIP. Of the 160 limpets tagged for the
study, four disappeared over the five-week study period. The shells of three
of these four limpets were severely cracked in the last observations made
before their disappearance, and they were assumed to have died.
Of the 75 limpets marked on sites with direct wave exposure, incidence
of new limpet shell damage was positively correlated with water velocity (r =
0.849, p « 0.05, see Figure 2 and Table 2). At sites with deflected wave
exposure or "ramped" waves, no significant correlation was detected (r =
0.679, p » 0.05). However, the overall incidence of newly damaged limpets did
not significantly differ between the two types of sites (mean dir. sites -
0.30%/day, se = 0.15%, mean indir. sites = 0.27%/day, se = 0.18%; paired t-test,t
= 0.686, p» 0.5).
STYROFOAM TARGET MEASUREMENTS OF WAVE PROJECTILE ACTION. Incidence
of new styrofoam impacts was positively correlated with maximal water
velocity at sites with direct wave exposure (r = 0.885, p « 0.05, see Table 2 and
Figure 3). At sites with deflected or "ramped" waves, no correlation was
detected (r = -0.784, p » 0.05). The actual frequency of styrofoam impacts per
target also differed significantly between the two types of sites, with directly
wave-exposed sites experiencing greater impact frequency than wave-
deflected sites (mean dir. sites = 4.76%/day, se = 0.82%, mean indir. sites =
1.86%/day, se = 0.54%; paired one-tailed t-test, t = 2.015, p « 0.05).
The relative size of styrofoam impacts clearly varied, but over the
course of the five-week period styrofoam dents that occurred early during the
study had noticeably shrunken in size, probably due to seawater-induced
