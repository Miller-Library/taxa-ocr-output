Figure 1: Log percent average activity of purified versus supernatant LDH
from P. cinctipes and P. manimaculis . For supernatants, thermal stability of
LDH from P. cinctipes is significantly higher than that from P. manimaculis.
Thermal stability of LDH in a supernatant is greater than that of the purified
enzyme for both species. Error bars represent standard deviations. (P.
cinctipes n=2;P. manimaculis n-4)
Figure 2: The method behind the derivation for the half-life of an enzyme.
The line is representative of a linear regression of thermal stability data
plotted as log percent activity versus denaturation time in minutes.
Figure 3: Mean temperatures for both the intertidal and subtidal pools
recorded at 10:00 am, when both pools were immersed, and 3:30 pm, the end
of the emersion period for the intertidal pool. Temperatures in the subtidal
pool remained constant across time points, while the intertidal pool showed a
increase in temperature after emersion.
Figure 4: Thermal stability of LDH in a supernatant for P. cinctipes and P.
manimaculis represented as percent average activity versus time in minutes
that the supernatant was incubated at 70Â°C. The thermal stability of LDH
from P. cinctipes was consistently higher than forP. manimaculis. Error bars
represent standard deviations. (P. cinctipes n=5;P. manimaculis n-4)
Figure 5: Average half-life in minutes for LDH in supernatants of claw
muscle from P. cinctipes in both subtidal and intertidal conditions for all
time points assayed in the experiment (Days 1, 4, 8, 22, and 36). Error bars
represent standard deviations. (Day 1 n-5; Day 4 subtidal, Day 8 and Day 22 n-
3; Day 4 intertidal and Day 36 n-4)
Figure 6: Average half-life in minutes for LDH in supernatants of claw
muscle from P. manimaculis in both subtidal and intertidal conditions for
all time points assayed in the experiment (Days 1, 4, 8, 22, and 36). Error bars
represent standard deviations. (n-4 for all time points)
