Temperature
Ten temperature measurements were made daily for each pool at 10:00
am and 3:30 pm with a hand-held electronic thermocouple (Omega). Under
rock temperatures were measured by attaching the themocouple to a thin
probe.
Thermal Stability of LDH
Frozen specimens were removed from the -80°C freezer and a single
claw was removed. Tissue from each claw was dissected out, weighed, and
homogenized in a ground glass homogenizer (Kontes-Duall) with six
volumes of 50 mM potassium-phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (K-Phos). All
procedures were carried out on ice. The homogenate was then centrifuged at
4°C for 20 minutes at 16000 g. The supernatant was removed, placed in a new
tube on ice, and its activity was assayed at 20°C in 2 ml of 150 uM NADH
(beta- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) and 5 mM pyruvate
in 80 mM imidazole-Cl, pH=6.9 at 20°C (following Childress and Somero,
1979). Activity was assayed by measuring the change in absorbance of NADH
at 340 nm in a spectrophotometer coupled to a chart recorder. Change in
optical density per minute (ÖD/min) was calculated by measuring the first
linear portion of the recording for each assay (approximately the first 30-45
seconds). Samples with activities over .250 ÖD/min. were diluted to
approximately .200 ÖD/min. with K-Phos. Supernatant samples were then
aliquoted into 200 ul thin-walled tubes in volumes ranging from 45 ul to 100
ul, depending on the amount of supernatant available. Denaturation was
performed by placing the samples in a pre-heated thermal cycler at 70°
removing them at specific time intervals, and placing them on ice. For P.
manimaculis the denaturation time points were 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60
minutes. For P. cinctipes the denaturation time points were 0, 10, 20, 30, 40,
60, 80, and 100 minutes. All samples besides the 0 time point were respun in
the refrigerated microfuge for 2 minutes after heating to remove the
precipitate that formed during heating. The thermal stabilities of each sample
were then measured in duplicate. Half-lives were calculated from regression
analysis of log % activity vs. denaturation time.(Figure 2) Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) tests using the half-life data were carried out using Systat 6.0. For
P. cinctipes the number of individuals for which thermal stabilities were
assayed varied (n=5: for the day of collection and Day 1 of the experiment, n-3
