The Effect of Acclimation to Intertidal and Subtidal Conditions
on the Thermal Stability of Supernatant Lactate
Dehydrogenase From Two Species of Porcelain Crab (Genus
Petrolithes)
Rebekah Harrison
ABSTRACT:
In Monterey Bay, Porcelain crabs inhabit discrete vertical zones: Petrolithes
cinctipes is found intertidally and P. manimaculis is found subtidally. Differences in
maximal temperature and emersion time for each species are associated with their individual
vertical zonation. The thermal stability of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a homogenate
supernatant from P. cinctipes is greater than that from P. manimaculis. Purification of LDH
removes this difference, causing the thermal stability of purified LDH from P. cinctipes to
decrease to that of P. manimaculis. Thus some extrinsic factor may influence the proteins
thermal stability. To determine whether the enzyme thermal stability could be altered,
acclimated crabs to various conditions of temperature and emersion. Temperature rose
between 8-15Â°C above ambient seawater temperature during the 5.5 hour emersion time in
one treatment, but did not change in the constantly immersed treatment. High levels of
mortality were only observed for P. manimaculis in the emersion treatment. Thermal
stabilities of LDH in homogenate supernatants did not change over a 36 day acclimation
period. Differences in LDH thermal stability between species persisted. These data suggest
that the mechanism causing the difference in stability between supernatant and purified
enzyme is a highly regulated and conserved trait which was not affected by conditions of the
experiment.
