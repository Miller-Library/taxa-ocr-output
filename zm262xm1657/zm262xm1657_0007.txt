RESULTS
Temperature
Temperatures measured at 10:00 am in both pools ranged between 10-
14°C throughout the duration of the experiment (Figure 3). In the subtidal
pool mean temperatures at 3:30 pm were extremely similar to those at 10:00
am. Mean temperatures in the intertidal pool, however, were greatly
elevated at 3:30 pm, after the 5.5 hour emersion period, as compared to 10:00
am temperatures (Figure 3). On four days maximal temperatures recorded in
the intertidal pool were above 28°C. This has been shown to be the
temperature at which 50% of P. manimaculis die (LT 50 for P. manimaculis)
(Stillman, unpublished data). On Day 33, the mean temperature at 3:30 pm
exceeded 28°C, but on no day did the mean temperature recorded reach 33°C
the LT 50 for P. cinctipes . Maximal temperatures exceeded 33°C only once
during the duration of the experiment. It should be noted, that the
temperatures recorded are characteristic of those that have been found in
natural subtidal and intertidal conditions (Stillman and Somero, 1996,
Hoffmann and Somero, 1995
Thermal Stability of LDH
The thermal stability of LDH from P. cinctipes was consistently higher
than for P. manimaculis throughout the experiment (Figure 4). Statistical
analysis (three factor ANÖVA of species, time, and treatment) demonstrated a
significant difference between species with a p value of less than 0.0001.
There was, however, no significant effect of acclimation treatments or
acclimation time on the thermal stability of LDH for either P. cinctipes or P.
manimaculis (Figure 5, 6). Similarly, comparisons made within species,
using two factor ANÖVAs, yielded no significant difference with either
acclimation treatment or time for either P. cinctipes or P. manimaculis
(Table 1).
Survivorship
A G-test of independence for recovery showed a significant interaction
between species and treatment (G-value after Williams' correction was equal
to 38.147, p=6.56x10-10). Examination of the data for non-proportionality
