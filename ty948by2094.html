Introduction: The unfertilized sea urchin egg is a very sleepy cell
metabolically, but fertilization triggers an activation of the egg which is
chafacterized by a sharp increase in oxidative phosphorylation, protein
synthesis and other metabolic processes. Another effect of activation is a rise
in the level of arginine phosphate (Chambers and Mende 1953) Arginine
phosphate often occurs in invertebrates and is analogous to creatine
phosphate in vertebrates. In the sea urchin egg, arginine phosphate serves
as a buffer of high energy phosphate and is closely linked to the energ
status of the cell. When arginine phosphate is depleted, several cellular
metabolic activities such as protein synthesis (Winklerand Linde.

signifies that the rise in the ratio of arginine phosphate to arginine (AP/A)as

not generally observed. There is littie consensus as to what actually happens
to the ATP/ADP ratio. For instance, Epel (1969) has observed that it remains

Discussion: These results give strong evidence that arginine is significantiy
compartmentalized in the sea urchin egg. The values of total arginine per
cell of 50 and 47 picomoles of arginine per cell compare favorably with
results of Gross and Fry as repoted by Giudice (1973) of .32 picomoles of
inine per cell. Some research tends to suggest that compartments of
ginine and other amino acids could exist in the sea urchin egg. Lee and

significance of the actual finding of arginine compartrents would extend
beyond the study of egg activation. It could also lead to studies into the
channeling of amino acids, into the energy needs of the developing embrye
and perhaps even to differentiated cells.
