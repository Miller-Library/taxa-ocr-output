<html><body><pre style='margin:2rem auto;width:fit-content'>Marroystis Fyrifers giant kelp, is a brown algae that forms a surface
canopy along the coast of North America from Baja California to San
Francisco, in South America, southern Africa, and southern Australia (Abbott
and Hollenberg 1975) It displays a typical Laminariles life cycle, with
alternation of generations from a microscopic, sexual gametophyte stage to a
large, asexual sporophyte stage (figure 1). Special fertile fronds called
sporophylis, located near the base of the kelp, release free-swimming spores
which attach to the substrate and form gametophytes. After about a month
of development (Deysher and Dean 1986), male gametophytes reease
biflagellate sperm which fertilize an egg attached to the female. The
porophyte begins growth attached to the female gametophyte. (see North
1974, Dayton 1935 for more details) Kelpforests dominated y Mayss
pyers have long been a subject of great interest because of their economie
and ecological importance. Since the advent of SCUBA, many researchers
have designed field experiments attempting to mode dyamis othe elp
forest. This has proved to be an extremely difficult task due to the complex,
interactive, and unpredictable nature of this environment.
To understand the kelp forest, one must begin with an understanding
of Marystis itself. Although studies are being carried out every day in
kelp forests around the world, thousands of questions are still unanswered.
Many inwestigators here in California have chosen to narrow down the
questions een arther, addressing the microscopie stages o theyss
life cycle. What are the dynamics of gametophyte recruitment and survival:
Whatfactors physical or environmental, control mortality? Many methods
for etudy have been developed, a few questions have been answered, but
many more remain. For example, i Mryss is fertile year round

sporophytes vary so significantiy with time of year? (Harris et al 1984
Layton et al. 1984, Ebeling et al. 1985, Reed et al. 1983) Why does only 1 in
10 gametophytes survive in the field? (North 1974) Andhy dona
estimated 2 of visible sporophyte recruits ever reach the surface? (Dayton
et al. 1964) Some parameters needed for success have bee determined
Deysher and Dean (1986) define arecruitment ino for nat

The technique of artificial seeding of Mroyss has been well
deweloped and used extensively. My procedure was similar to that used by
number of experimenters, including Neushul (1963), Anderson and North
(1969), Deysher and Dean (1986), and Reed (in prep.). Gametophyte cultures
were grown on frosted glass slides (Fisher fully frosted cytology slides) at
densities from 33 mm2 to 180 mm2 Glass slides weree
settling surface because they are easily manipulated and they facilitate
microscopic viewing of the gametophytes. Ripe sporophyseed

by cleaning 20 or so ripe sporophylls with a paper towel to remove any
epiphytes, and then soaking the sporophylls in chilled filtered seawater for
2-3 nours. The density of the resulting spore solution was measured usin
nemacytometer. Densities used for plating ran from 8.1X10sp
to 5.9 X 100 spores mi-1. The solution was poured 3 to 4 cm high in a tray
holding trosted glass slides. Thesporeswa
befère the trays were washed in frech filtered sea water. After three days
the gametophytes were large enough to clearly count and identify under a
4 objective of a compound microscope. Gametophyte survivorship was
measured by scanning 15 evenly-spaced25 m fields onidO
the middle inch of each slide was ezamined, leaving an inch on each side to
manipulate the slides in the field. All slides were kept subered
filtered sea water in a Plexiglass slide holder during viewing. Table 1 shows
te density of spores in solution that correspond to density of gametophytes
seenon the slides three days late.

In the field slides were held by surgical tubing attached to 25.4 cm X
15.2 cm X 0.6 cm Plexiglass sheets. The Plexiglass was attached with 2
masonry screws to circular concrete patio stones, 30.5 om diameter and 5.1

circumference of one patio stone with copper paint (Interlux Copper-Lux
Antifouling Bottom Paint, 66 58 cuprous oxide), left one bare, and painted
one in alternating 450 arcs of copper paint and bare concrete. Each patio
stone could hold up to 8 microscope slides. (Figure 2)

directly. Sometimes this treatment mimicked the effects of the full-copper
treatment sometimes it mimicked the bare concrete treatment, and
sometimes it fell directly between the two. I believe that this is due to the
observed behavior of individual snails when encountering the half-copper
stones. Snails would climb onto the plate or avoid it, depending only on
hich area of the stone the snail first encountered
