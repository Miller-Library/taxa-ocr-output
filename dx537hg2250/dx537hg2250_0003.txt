CGMP, and cholinergic stimulation of a molecular cascade that begins with the activation of
phospholipase C and leads to CGMP production.
Investigations of physiological cell deletion and neurodegenerative disorders
indicate the involvement of processes like competition for trophic factors and programmed
cell death. This work describes a new potential mechanism behind these phenomena
observed under cholinergic stimulation. With the assumption that the events that occur in
the neuroblastoma cells are representative of those in neuronal systems, contact-related cell
death might be a new method of neuron elimination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Solutions
Normal External saline: 146 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8mM CaCly, 0.8 mM
MgSO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 0.3 mM NazHPO4, 5 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH
7.4.
All chemical solutions used were made by dilutiing the chemical into the NE saline.
Cell Culture and Differentiation
NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cell line was obtained from Department of Tissue
Culture at UCSF. The cells were passaged in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium
(DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum from Hyclone. Chips made from glass microscope
slides were added to the Falcon polystyrene tissue culture plates as the cells only adhere to
glass and the chips could be easily removed for cell observation and manipulation under the
microscope. Cells were maintained under humidity incubation with 90% air, 10% CO2 at
37Â°C. When they reached approximately 60% confluency, they were differentiated by
culturing in 2% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as described by Kimhi, et als. All cells were
either fourth or sixth passage, and had been under 2% DMSO for a minimum of 12 days.
