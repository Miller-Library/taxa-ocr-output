to the neuroblastoma cell line, which could be overexpressing inducible NO synthase or
underexpressing endogenous antioxidants. On the other hand, these NIE cells could be
exhibiting a natural mechanism utilized in nervous tissues for the process of selective
neuronal elimination. Programmed cell death and competition for synapses and trophic
factors are among the most favored models explored in studies of physiological neuron
deletion seen in development and neurological disorders. With a better characterization of
the contact-related cell deaths in the NIE-115 neuroblastoma cell line, investigations in
actual brain tissue may find this phenomenon to be a revealing new mechanism of neuronal
death that participates in the shaping of nervous systems or the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative diseases.
