Figure 1. Number of new neurites per cell in field under various chemical treatments.
Range of field size: 11-22 cells. NE Saline: incubation in normal external saline,
number of experiments (n) -3; Carbachol: incubation in ImM carbachol, n-2;
cAMP: incubation in ImM 8-bromo-cAMP, n-2; br CGMP: incubation in ImM
8-bromo-cGMP, n=1; db CGMP: incubation in ImM dibutyryl-CGMP, n=1.
Figure 2. Number of new neurites per cell in field under treatments including carbachol
and arginine derivatives. Range of field size: 19-35 cells. NE Saline: incubation
in normal external saline, number of experiments (n) = 3; D-Arg: incubation in
IUM N6-monomethyl-D-arginine, n=1; L-Arg: incubation in IuM N6Â¬
monomethyl-L-arginine, n-1; Carb/L-Arg: incubation in ImM carbachol, IuM
No-monomethyl-L-arginine, n=1; Carbachol: incubation in ImM carbachol, n-2.
Figure 3. Percent of cells in field possesing new neurites under various chemical
treatments. Incubations as described in figure 1 legend, control = NE saline and
CBC = Carbachol. Error bars acheived through bionomial test.
Figure 4. Percent of cells in field that die during course of 2-hour observation under the
respective chemical treatments; data does not distinguish whether deaths were
contact related. Carbachol 1 and 2 are the two experiments grouped as
Carbachol in all other firgures. All others (n-8) refers to the following
previously described experiments: NE saline, n-2; cAMP, n=1; db CGMP, n=1;
br CGMP, n=1; and L-Arg, n=1.
