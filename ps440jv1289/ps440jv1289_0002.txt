Temperature
To determine if constant, extreme temperatures
stimulate rolling, isopods were placed in three covered
finger bowls with moist paper towels on the bottom.
One was kept at 0°C, one at about 25°C, and the last
at 35°0. At the time of death of the isopods in the
low and high temperatures, no rolling had been observed.
No rolling was seen in the animals at room temperature.
Touch
Tactile stimuli were observed to immediately
initiate the rolling behavior, supporting the find-
ings of Saxena(1957). Touching them with any hard
object, shaking them in a container or in the hand,
or dropping them onto a hard surface all produced roll¬
ing.
Optimal Environmental Conditions
In collecting Armadillidium vulgare from under
iceplant above Agassiz Beach at Hopkins, it was
noticed that the isopods were usually rolled after
the iceplant was lifted up. This observation led to a
hypothesis that the rolled position is the normal rest-
ing state of the isopod when environmental conditions
are the most favorable for survival. Warburg (1964)
and Waloff (1941) both found that the activity of
