Rolling by Armadillidi
and Predation
Hypothesis
Since the isopods were probably not usually
in the rolled position, the fact that they were
observed rolled under the iceplant suggested that
lifting the iceplant caused the behavior. In order
to lift the iceplant, roots had to be pulled up also,
which disturbed the soil and dead leaves the isopods
live in. The hypothesis that led to this study was
that a scratching predator, like a bird, could cause
the same kind of disturbance of the soil and organic
litter that uprooting the iceplant did. This dis-
turbance could produce a tactile stimulus for rollÂ¬
ing, or the change in microclimate conditions which
has been suggested as a possible stimulus.
Observations of Chickens,
Scratching Predators, Feeding
on Armadillidium vulgare
Dr. Robin Burnett, in personal communication,
reported observing chickens eating isopods, using a
scratching behavior to find them in leaf litter.
Detailed observations were subsequently made of these
chickens feeding on isopods in an area covered about
an inch deep with dry oak leaves. The scratching
behavior of a chicken, in feeding on animals in litter,
