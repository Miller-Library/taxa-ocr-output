Rolling by Armadillidium vulgare and Predation
pelled away from a chicken when the predator scratches,
due to the sphere shape which rolls well on flat surfaces.
Exactly what causes the isopods to roll when un-
covered by the scratching is unknown. Turning over
a rock under which isopods are living can also cause
rolling. The stimulus could be tactile, changing light
intensity or a sudden change in microhabitat conditions
such as humidity, or temperature. The same stimuli
could elicit the response when a chicken scrapes away
a layer of leaves looking for food.
The extension of the results of this study to con-
clusions about the adaptive significance of rolling to
Armadillidium vulgare are not possible. However, the
behavior does appear to be a successful defense against
some types of predation. Evolutionarily, whether the
behavior was a direct adaptive response to predation
or a response to some other pressure, which had the
effect of limiting some types of predation is a matter
of conjecture. Low humidity, probably the most lethal
pressure the isopods face, has been shown not to be a
stimulus for the behavior. (Waloff) Rather, the isopods
become more active in low humidities. (Waloff, Warburg 1964)
The assumption by Heeley (1941) that rolled isopods were
conserving moisture in the respiratory pleopods in conÂ¬
ditions of low humidity is made even more tenuous by
actual water loss data. Edney (1951) found that more
