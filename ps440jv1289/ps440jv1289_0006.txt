Rolling by Armadillidium vulgare and Predation
was unrolling it was hit by leaves the chicken had
scratched back from the new area. The isopod immediÂ¬
ately rolled up again. It eventually unrolled and
moved quickly under the layer of oak leaves.
The Effect of Rolling on Predation:
Materials and Methods
Chickens were therefore used as the scratching
predators for the experimental part of this study.
They are docile and easy to observe and eat isopods
readily. An experiment was conducted to determine
quantitatively what effect the rolled position of
Armadillidium vulgare had on predation by the chickens.
A number of isopods were glued, while in the rolled
position, with a drop of Eastman Kodak 911 glue placed
where the head and uropods join. When the animals were
prevented from opening until after the glue had set,
they were effectively forced to remain rolled. Twenty
of the rolled isopods, and twenty normal isopods were
mixed together and scattered on a patch of bare dirt
near a chicken. One hen was used for all the trials.
After the chicken had eaten about half the isopods, the
remaining ones were collected and the animals of each
type not eaten were counted. Another test of the same
kind, using unrolled animals, half with a spot of glue
on their dorsal surfaces, had shown that the presence of
glue on the isopods produced no significant effect on
