Rolling by Armadillidium vulgare and Predation
Armadillidium is at a minimum at 100% relative humidity.
The habitat under the iceplant was very moist, probably
reaching 100% relative humidity among the dead leaves
where the isopods were found. The rolled position of
the isopod is an inactive state. Therefore, the hypo¬
thesis that rolling is an inactive state in response
to a very humid, favorable environment seemed reasonable.
An experiment was set up to investigate this. 250 ml
beakers were filled with loose, moist dirt, some deep
enough to allow the isopods to bury, and some with only
a thin layer of dirt. The hypothesis was that animals
that were able to bury themselves in the moist dirt.
where desiccation stress is absent, would be in optimal
conditions and would roll up. An attempt was made to
instantly kill the isopods while still in position in
the dirt by quick-freezing the beakers in an alcohol-
dry ice bath. This failed, but by carefully picking
through the dirt with forceps it was possible to uncover
many isopods without disturbing them. No formal data
was taken due to uncertainty about the accuracy of the
digging method. However, those isopods uncovered with¬
out disturbance were not rolled. With this suggestion
that the rolled position is not the normal, resting
position of Armadillidium vulgare, it was possible to
concentrate on a second hypothisis, the one that became
the working hypothesis for this study.
