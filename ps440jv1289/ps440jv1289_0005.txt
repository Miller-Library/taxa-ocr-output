Rolling by Armadillidium vulgare and Predation
consists of two scrapes with each leg, throwing debris
diagonally back and away from the chicken. Then the
chicken quickly jumps straight back scraping a large
amount of debris under its feet, held close together
under its body. The chicken then closely examines the
uncovered patch of dirt and picks up food using quick
stabs with its beak. The inspection of a cleared patch
rarely lasts longer than ten seconds. Isopods were
frequently uncovered and eaten. Armadillidium vulgare
were present in the area in very small numbers, the
dominant species being Porcellio scaber. Armadillidium
were placed in the area so that observations could be
made more easily on their response to the chickens
feeding behavior. When Armadillidium were uncovered by
a chicken's scratch, they often appeared on the bare
ground in the rolled position. They also appeared in
an unrolled state, crawling across the dirt, or lying
on their dorsal surfaces with their legs moving rapidly.
These active isopods were usually eaten immediately by
the chickens. Rolled isopods were also eaten, but
usually after the active ones, and less frequently.
In one case, a chicken uncovered an isopod, which rolled
up. After passing it over, the chicken moved forward
and began to scratch in a new area. Just as the isopod
