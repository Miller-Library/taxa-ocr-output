Rolling by
llidium vulgare and Predation
Arm
than 50% of the water lost by Armadillidium vulgare in
low humidity is through the dorsal surface. This sug¬
gests that were the isopod to roll in low humidity, water
conservation would be minimal, considering the extra
dorsal surface that is exposed when the animal rolls.
Paris (1963) reported that drowning is a major cause of
winter deaths, and this environmental pressure could
have been a factor in the evolution of the rolling be¬
havior.
Summary
1. Scratching by chickens in feeding causes Armadillidium
vulgare to roll up.
2. Chickens eat Armadillidium that are active more than
rolled or dead ones.
Acknowledgement
I wish to thank Dr. Malvern Gilmartin for his help
throughout this project and in preparing the manuscript.
Special thanks go to Dr. Robin Burnett, gentleman farmer,
for the use of his chickens, without which this project
would not have been possible.
