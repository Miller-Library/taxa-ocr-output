Rolling by Armadillidium vulgare and Predation.
Introduction
Armadillidium vulgare is a terrestrial isopod with
the capability of rolling into a ball. The purpose of
this study was to determine what effect the rolling
behavior has on predation by a scratching animal.
Previous studies have linked the rolling behavior
of Armadillidium vulgare to various stimuli. Saxena (1957)
was able to induce the behavior by using a hard tactile
stimulus. Salamanders have been observed eating the
isopods by Miller(1938). He reported that large individ-
uals were able to escape predation by rolling into a
ball which the salamanders were unable to swallow.
Waloff (1941) suggested that the behavior may be a re¬
sponse to suddenly changing microclimate conditions.
Observations on Armadillidium vulgare
A set of preliminary studies were conducted to pro¬
vide qualitative insights into possible factors rela-
tingto the rolling behavior.
Humidity
To determine if low humidity conditions stimulate
rolling, isopods were put in a Stender dish set on
Dri-Rite desiccator in a 250 ml covered beaker. None
of the isopods rolled in this 0% relative humidity
condition, supporting the findings of Waloff (1941).
