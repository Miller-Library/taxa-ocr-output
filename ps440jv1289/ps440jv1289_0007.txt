Rolling by Armadillidium vulgare and Predation
the feeding. A similar experiment was performed using
ten normal isopods and ten dead, unrolled animals per trial
to detenmine theeffect that simple movement had on predaÂ¬
tion by a chicken. Again, the feeding was stopped when
about half the isopods had been eaten.
Results
The results of the first experiment appear in Table 1.
The results of the second experiment are in Table 2. In
both experiments the unrolled, active animals were eaten
first. In many cases, a moving isopod was neatly plucked
from among several rolled or dead ones that were never
eaten.
Discussion
From these experiments it appears that a moving
isopod draws the attention of a feeding chicken more
than a motionless one. When given a choice, a chicken
eats the moving isopods first. Saxena found the mean
length of time of rolling after a tactile stimulus to
be about ten seconds. If Armadillidium uncovered by
a chicken remained rolled for this length of time,
they would stand a good chance of not being eaten,
as the chickens rarely examined an uncovered area
longer than ten seconds. An isopod which does not
roll when uncovered is very likely to be eaten, as
Armadillidium in the unrolled state is almost always
moving, either crawling, or if on it's dorsal surface.
