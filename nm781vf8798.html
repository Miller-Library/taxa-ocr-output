Different areas of anemone were found to have differen
relative amounts of chlorophyll-a, and differential apparent
division rates of zooxanthellae.
Pheophytin-a was used as an
assay of compounds released to anemone tissue due to zooxan-
thellae degeneration. Pheophytin appears to be periodical
accumulated in the anemone tissue, indicating a possible use

The investigation of the benefits received by the host
anemone in its symbiotic relationship with the zooxanthellae,
intracellular and intercellular dinoflagellates, has been
limited to the transfer of organic compounds between the
anemone and viable populations of the algae. Trench (1971
demonstrated that zooxanthellae in vitro release photosyn-
thetically fixed 'C to the host tissue in the form of glycerol
alanine, glucose, and organic acids, without lysis of the alga
1968) and ammonia (Kawaguti, 195
cells. Phosphate (von Holt,
ransfer in corals have also been studied.
It is known (Huscatine, 1974) that anemones sustain their
zooxanthellae in a steady-state, with new cells being produced
and degenerate cells being extruded in the mucus (Taylor, 1968)
These degenerate cells have enormous potential for the anemone

reports that the giant clam <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tridacna gigas : Exact'>Tridacna gigas</span> transports its
symbiotic algae from the sunlight to the inner tissues wher
they become senescent. The senile algae then enter the blood

Cultured zooxanthellae were used to determine the protein
content of a single algal cell. The zooxanthellae were
collected by centrifugation of homogenized anemone tissue
and cultured in enriched seawater medium. Protein determin-
ation was performed by the Lowry method (1951). Population
counts of the cultures were made with a hemocytometer.
Chlorophyll determination of a zooxanthellae population
was performed by acetone extraction, after collecting the alga-
centrifugation of anemone homogenate.
They were washed
in sterile seawater and recentrifuged five times.
Populati
counts were again made in a hemocytometer.
The amounts of chlorophyll-a vary greatly between different
areas of the anemone. The results of the chlorophyll assay
are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. Tentacles, mesenteries
and middle column have statistically distinct mean relative
values (student's T test, p C.05), while the oral disc an
apper column are nearly equal.
Pheophytin-a is magnesium-free chlorophyll-a. It is the
form in which chlorophyll is released from algal cells. The
pheophytin-a/ chlorophyll-a ratios are in Table 2 and Figure
can be seen to exhibit a wide range of values, even when
converted to relative terms. The oral disc shows a rather
tight distribution, while all other tissue parts have larg

andard deviations, close to the mean values
The apparent rates of division for each tissue are shown
in Table 3 and Figure 3. Statistically, the mean tentacle
value is distinctly lowest and the mean upper
column value
is distinctly highest (student's T test, p K.05). The mese
teries, oral disc, and middle column have very similar mear
division rates.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Zooxanthellae : Exact'>Zooxanthellae</span> were found to have 2.5x10 mg of chlo

Observations were made during the course of this inves
ation regarding the extrusion of zooxanthellae from the
anemone. Muscatine (1974) reports periodic extrusion of
ucus containing zooxanthellae from the mouth. Possible
urces for these zooxanthellae are the mesenteries, as rep
Taylor (1968), and the large mass of zooxanthellae
bserved in the lumen of the tentacles.

First, consider the chlorophyll-a assay for the various

may be constantly transported from the upper column, middle
column, and oral disc to the tentacles and mesenteries for
legeneration and extrusion.
In either case, the lack of variation

a high pheophytin concentration. Furthermore, the negative

determined instead by an accumulation of the pheophytin-a
itself which has been released from
degenerating zooxanthellae,
the fluctuations would have no effect upon the apparent division
rates. With the small number of trials, it is possible that
luctuations in the apparent division rates do occur, but

though, that if the fluctuations are present, they would hav
become visible in at least one tissue part of one anemone,
simply on the basis of the wide occurrence of variance in th
pheophytin-a/ chlorophyll-a ratios.
The results indicate
therefore, that a high number of senescent cells creates:
latively high amount of pheophytin. But whereas the senes
