Conclusions.
This experiment, as does experiment C, serves mainly as a
control on some of the variables present in A and B. It is here
shown that the defined times here used are not factors of
excessive mortality in these h boratory populations.
E. GENERAL CONCLUSTONS
Singular behavioral patterns and those of interacting individ-
uals were not considered in this study. Some of the aspects of
dominance are considered in papers by Reese (1962) and in ar
companion paper by the author. Behavioral factors are undoubtedly
one of the principle factors of mortality in lab as well as in
natural populations. Pagurus samuelis is highly aggressive, and
one is tempted to suggest from casual observations that murder
is one of the chief operative mechanisms of population control.
Even this is only the manifestation of behavior preceeding it.
To attempt to illucidate some of the factors which may elicit
such behavior has been the object of this study.
SUMNA RY
Factors influencing the mortality rates in laboratory
populations of Pagurus samuelis Stimpson were examined. Among
factors shown to be important are those involving space, avail-
ability of shells, and behavioral interactions. Factors negligible
to the mortality rates of these studies were starvation and time.
