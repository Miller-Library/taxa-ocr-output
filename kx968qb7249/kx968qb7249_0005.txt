C. AVAILABILITY OF FOOD
Methods and results.
Welsh reports in Watermann (1961) that some decapod crus-
tacea lave been starved for periods exceeding two months. Sixty
five isolated individuals were kept in 50ml. beakers placed in
aquaria with aeriation and running sea water for 30 days. See Fig. 1.
Results and conclusions.
During the 30 day period no more than 5 individuals represent-
ing a mortality of 7.6% died. In the initial 15 day period of
starvation no individuals were lost. As the experiments involving
area, shells and food ran for no longer than two weeks, starvation
appears to be a negligible factor influencing mortality rates in
these studies.
D. TIME AS A FA CTOR
Methods and results.
Two experiments were performed: in the first the individuals
were isolated as in the above experiment. Twenty - five individuals
were used. Within this group there was a loss of one individual
in fourteen days for a mortality of 1%. See Fig. 5. In the second
experiment twenty - five individuals were placed in the 100%
area and allowed to remain for fourteen days. After five days
five individuals had been lost for a mortality of 20%, but after
this time there were no further losses for the remainder of the
fourteen days.
