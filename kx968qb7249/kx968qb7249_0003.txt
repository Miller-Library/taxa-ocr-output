of 20% of the 100% area were made in the two reciprocal experimemts
at 24 hour intervals. The maximum area available to population A
was 180% of the 100% 20 x 20 cm. area. The minimum available to
population B was 20% of the 100% area. Results are shown in Fig. 1
and table 1.
Conclusions.
Limitations of space appear to induce high mortality when
available area falls below 50% of the 100% pre-established area.
When the ratio of crabs to area approaches this 50% value, inter-
actions increase. Death is usually by murder of one individual
by another of larger size: an individual is approached by another,
extracted from its shell, and severed in two between cephalothorax
and abdomin. To buffer interactions imposed by this high ratio
of crabs to space, double this minimum 50%, or the originally
established "minimum" of 100% area (20 x 20 cm/ 25 crabs) will
be used as the area for further experiments.
B. AVAILABILITY OF SHELLS
Methods and results.
Aquaria measuring l x 26 cm. were divided into two areas
as described above with polyethylene covered partitions. Crabs
were sorted into a size class of 1.5 plus or minus 0.1 cm. as
before, and Tagula funebralis shells which had been occupied by
crabs in the field were cleared of their owners and sorted into
a size class of 2.0 plus or minus O.1 cm. measuring the shell
at its greatest diameter. Two experiments were completed. In the
