INTRODUCTION
Factors influencing the mortality of individual isolated
organisms are often relatively simple to illucidate compared
to those determining the mortality of a population of interacting
individuals. Calhoun (1957, 1962a, 1962b) has amply pointed out
the fact that the elements of interaction are not simple but
highly complex. Physical as well as psyckological room is often
demanded. The complexities of interactions, behaviors, and
dominance hierarchies compound the factors at interplay in
social animals.
Through investigationof some of the latter mentioned factors,
the study of the factors influencing mortality in laboratory
populations became attractive. Preliminary observations made on
populations kept for behavioral studies suggested that the factors
of space, availability of shells or food, time, and behavioral
interactions might be involved in influencing the rate of mortal-
ity in these populations. Behavioral factors, considered in
another paper completed during the same period of observation,
will not be here considered.
