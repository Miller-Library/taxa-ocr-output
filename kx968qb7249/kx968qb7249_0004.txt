first experiment the initial ratio of crabs to shells was set
at 1:2 . Twelve shelled individuals were placed with 12 additional
empty shells in the 100% area. At 21 hour intervals mortalities
were countedand new tank-adapted individuals were added for those
lost. Area was kept constant, as was the ratio of crabs to shells.
At each of these intervals 50% of the unoccupied shells were
removed. The results are shown in Figure 2.
In the second experiment 25 housed animals were allowed to
remain undisturbed in a 100% area for five days. At the end of
this time interval no mortalities were recorded for this group.
At succeeding 24 hour intervals 10% of the crabs were removed
from their shells and returned to the tank. Mortalities were
measured over the ten day period of the experiment. Area and
the number of individuals remained constant as above. Results
are shown in Fig. 3.
Conclusions.
Within this defined population mortalities do not greatly
increase until the ratio of crabs to shells falls below 2:1.
It is difficult to infer that this ratio might become an effective
cause of death in natural populations in that Belknap (personal
communication, Hopkins spring group) found a ratio of crabs to

Ashells of 1:l among intertidal and subtidal Pagurus. It is
possible, however, that such field conditions might arise to
make this ratio a factor in mortality. Such a feld ratio does
