Methods.and results.
Aquaria measuring Lx 2t cm. in total floor area were util
ized. Movable partitions of wood covered with polyethylene to
prevent climbing of the wood by the crabs allowed variance in
the floor area. Both running sea water and constant aeration
were employed. Crabs collected from the intertidal zones off
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, and Point Pinos,
Pacific Grove, were sorted into size classes by measurement
laterally across the cephalothorax. Preliminary experiments
involving 100 crabs of a size class 2.0 cm plus or minus 0.1 cm.
in aquaria L4 x 2to cm. were set up. Considerable aggressive
behavior is shown by the animals during the first 1-6 hours of
interaction. Subsequently the crabs tend to pile up in the corners
of the aquaria, and in no way do thegutilize the whole of the
space available to them. A partition iin the aquarium was employed
to vary the area. These preliminary experiments indicated that an
area 20 x 20 cm. in total floor area could support a maximum of
25 crabs for a minimum of 5 days with no greater than 204
mortality (see experiment D.). This space, arbitrarily designated
as 1004 area, was taken as a base for further experiments.
In experiments involving 25 crabs this 1006 area was increased,
and decreased in a reciprocal experiment, while the ratio of crabs
to shells, total number of individuals, and the absence of food
were constant. Tank adapted individuals of five days were added
to restore the tot al number when mortalities occurred. Fluctuations
