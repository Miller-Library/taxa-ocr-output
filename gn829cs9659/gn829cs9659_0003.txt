This project furthers our understanding of fast muscle diversitu
by charactenizing the propenties of one set of presumably multiplu
innervated fast fibers, those in sand dab fin muscle. In oueryiew,
the propenties to be examined include: properties of twitch and tetant,
the nature of neuromuscular transmission, and the absence of action
potenttals. In addition, the role of extracellular caleium in the

activation of contraction considered.

Preparation
Specimens of Citharichthus sordidus were obtatned fishing off
Lover's Point, Tontereg Bag. Fish were maintained prior to use in
lange outdoor tanks with circulating, fresh sea water.

Measurement of isometric tenston:
Experiments were performed on isolated single musele units (one
muscle, one bone, and one spine) mounted near their in vivo resting
length in a 10 ml plexiglass chamber. The ends of the muscle close
to the myotomes was pinned to the sylgard (Dow Corning) floor and the
cut spine was tied to a force transducer with silk thread (Gilly 2
Hut, 1980). Contraction was elicited by application of longitudinally
ortentad shocks generated by a Grass 5-รณ stimulaton via platinum/
platinum black electrodes. Pulse duration varied between 0.5-2.0 ms
and field strength from 3-35 volts/em. Electrodes were mounted on a
micromanipulator and could be positioned close to the muscle ends.
Contractions were also elicited by local stimulation of a small
number of fibers with a small, pambling bipolar electoode. This
technique was useful in qualitativelg exploring excitability in different
