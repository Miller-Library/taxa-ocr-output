D-600 is an organte calcium-channel blocker. Both drugs show vartable
effects on various muscle and nerve preparations.
Neuromuscular Transmission:
At most of the muoneural junctions in fast vertebrate muscle,
each nerve impulse is followed by a similar impulse in the muscle
fibers which propogates rapidlg in both directions toward the tendons,
thus ensuring a suffictently synchronous contraction along the length
of the fiber. Uhile a sunchronous contraction cleanly can occur
in sand dab fast fibers, muscle impulses similar to nerve impulses
(oresumably action potentials) are not seen. Onlg depolarizing
end-plate potenttals can be doiven. The junction potentials that
ace elicited in response to repetitive nerue shocks summate temporally
to depolarize the muscle cell to about -40 mU and hold voltage at
that steady level, failing to depolarize further. Action potentials
are not seen even when high frequency stimuli are applied.
End-plate potenttals ape characterized by long decags (fig. 5a),

One unexplained phenomenon observed is that the decay accompanging

injection decays to one-half amplitude in coughlg 10-15 ms (figs. 5c).
Uariation in the rise time of junction potentials with successive
cepetitive shocks is also characteristic of the fast fibers. As
illustcated in figs. 5b X 6a, the first end-plate potential in a
series rises much more slouly than subsequent end-plate potentials.
This observation is not get fully understood, but probably involves
