ABSTRACT
In a sand dab fin musc le poeparation, the electnical and mechanical
poperties of a fast twitch muscle have been studied. The "long"
(presumably multiply innervated) fast fibers have resting potentials
of -75 to -80 mU and are taken to threshold for contraction (-40 mU)
by depolarizing junction potenttals. All-on-nothing action potenttals
are not seen, even when suprathreshold shocks are applied. Twitches
ape very fast; contraction reaches a peak within 10 ms and pelaxation
is complete within 20 ms at 18'c. Direct stimulation produces unfused
tetant up to at least 200 Hz.
