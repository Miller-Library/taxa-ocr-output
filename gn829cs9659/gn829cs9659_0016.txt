Table 1. Solutions emploged.
pH's of all solutions emploged ranged between 7.0-7.3, osmolaritu
between 400-420 mosm.
30 mm glucose was added to each solution poion to experiments.
Uantrolene sodium was obtained from U. Gillg, D-600 from T, Scheuer.
All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical.
All experiments were conducted in fish ringen except those necessitating
0 Na. and K-Glutamate. Uhen gilai eingers wene used, fish cingee was
used initially as a control. Fish and gilai oingers did not give
differing control twitches and tetani.
