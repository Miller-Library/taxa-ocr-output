tong fiber sarcomepes ape distinct, and measure between 7.7 and
1.9 in length at rest. This is somewhat shopter than resting
sarcomere length of most vertebrate skeletal muscle fibers.
Fibers of a shorten length relative to the long fibens ape also
depicted in fig. 2b. These oun between the long fast fibers and the
adjacent bone at about a 45Â° angle. They extend onlg along the
spine half of the muscle bundle. These fibers ace very slou (see
also belou) and were not used for the present studg. However, this
pegion of the muscle deserves histological examination, because
stouctures closely resembling muscle spindles in higher veotebrates
were observed at the spine end of the slow fiber pegion. This is
noteworthy, because muscle spindles in teleosts have been descriged
only in one case (Taeda, et al, 1983), and that structure was verg
primitive, containing only one intrafusal musele fiber.
Properties of tuitches and tetant:
Fig. 3a illustrates that the long fibers respond to a single
shock (between 3-20 volt/cm field strength) applied along the length
of the entire muscle with a fast twitch, 10-15 ms to peak, and a
capid relaxation, 20-30 ms, at 17-20'c. (The term twitch, as used in
this papen is defined as a capid contraction.) This speed of
contraction and relaxation is comparable to one of the fastest
vectebcate muscles described, cat extraocular muscles at 3' c
(Bach-u-Rita 8 Ito, 1966). Long fibeos are much faster than frog
(Rana) twitch fibers which follou a time course of 30-50 ms to peak
contcaction and 100 ms to relax at coom tempecature (Katz, 1966).
Fig. 3b-c indicate that shoot fibers are activated to contract
with yeru strong shocks (25-30 v/cm). The short fibers are exceedingly
