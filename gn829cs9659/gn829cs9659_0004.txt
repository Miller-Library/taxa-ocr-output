egions of the muscles.
Tension pecordings were taken on a Brush 220 pen recorder and a
Textronix storage oscilloscope.
Simultaneous pecording of junction potential and isometoic tension:
A suction electrode on a motor nerve and an intracellular
microelectrode were added to the apparatus described above to record
neuromuscular transmission. The suction electrode had a 200u, diameten
tip made of polgethylene tubing mounted on a glass capillarg. Fibers
which were seen to contract in response to nerve stimulation were
impaled with the microeleetrode close to the spine end of the muscle.
Tembrane potenttal was measured as the voltage difference between the
intracellular microelectrode (30-30 megohms, filled with 3 T KC1) and
a Ag:AgCl bath electrode, taken through a UPI electmeter. Stimulating
pulses were applied to the nerve using a UPl digital pulse generator.
Experiments ended with between 0-5 mU electrode deift.
Expepiments utilizing tuo intoacellular micpoelectoodes:
Fibers were impaled with two microelectrodes (20-30 To). One was
used for injecting current (filled with 2 f KCitrate) while membrane
potential was measured as described above. Injected curpent was
collected by a Ag:Agcl bath electrode and an operational amplifien.
current-voltage converter (vintual ground) circuit. Pulses were
generated, and reconded data were sampled by a digital computer-based
system described in Gillg X Scheuer (1984). The voltage clamp circuit
used is also described in that pape.
All experiments wera conducted at room temperature, about 19c.
The composition of solutions employed is given in Table 1. Solutions
were changed by draining the chamber and subsequently adding one on
