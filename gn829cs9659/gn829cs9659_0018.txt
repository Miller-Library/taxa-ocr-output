Eiguce 7. Fast fibers do not produce action potentials. This
recording of membrane potential was taken using two intracellulae
microelectrodes. The top trace in the record indicates the injected
current in nA and the current pulses ane seen on the left. This
trace also notes the 0 mU level. The bottom trace monitors membcane
potential. Shocks which brought membrane potential to or beuond
thoeshold for contraction (about -44 mU) caused twitches. Tension
is not meconded in this experiment, but contraction was seen theough
the microscope. It'is important to abserve that while indirect
nerve shocks were unable to dive membrane potential more oositive
than - 40 mU, direct injection of current can take membrane
potential at least to a suprathreshold level of -20 mU. Undec
such suprathreshold conditions, action potentials are still not
produced.
Eiguce 8. Effects of 0 Na, TIX 2 0 Ca on contraction. Isometoic
tension recordings illustrate that Na-free/ TIX media show little
ettect on tetanic contractions while Ca-free/EGTA medta dcastically
decrease tension outout.
Eigure 9. Independence of contraction from extracellular calcium.
A voltage clamp analysis demonstrates that extracellular calcium is
not required for fast fiber contraction. The points graphed are
numbered in order of successive determinations at the various holding
potentials. The average value for contraction threshold foom e.o.o.
is -44 mU and is draun on the graph (dotted line).
