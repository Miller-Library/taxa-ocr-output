most vertebrates and are akin to inventebrates in requiring extra¬
cellular calcium for contraction (see Gillg 8 Scheuer, 1984). Voltage
clamp experiments were carpied out to further clanifu the cole of
extracellular calcium in contraction activation, of fast sand dab
muscle. Tembrane potential is held at a centain holding potential
and 20 ms depolarizations are delivered with increasing amplitude
until contractile responses are seen through the microscope. In this
fashion, contractile threshold can be determined. Results of this
procedure at several holding potentials in both Ca-containing and Ca¬
free media are plotted in figure 9. Contraction occurs in O-Ca
medium at a faioly normal threshold voltage until holding potential
is ceduced to quite depolantzed values. At -20 mU holding potential,
contraction fails in the Ca-free medium. Failure is probably due to
inactivation of E-C coupling in a voltage-dependent manner, and not
pelated directly to caleium.
The absence of contraction noted in figure 8 in 0 Ca/5 mf EGTA
medium is probably due to depolarization of the membrane due to low
calcium concentration. Resting potentials measured in the Ca-free
medium tended to be substantially less negative than the noomal
value of -70 to -80 mU. Failure of 0 Na/TTX-containing solutionsto
abolish contraetion is consistent with the view that action potentials
are not involved in response to direct stimulation (fig.3) in the
activation of sand dab muscle.
DISCUSSION
The electrical and mechanical propenties of the fast twitch fibers
desepibed in this study mag seem inappropotate or imcompatible when
considered individually, but when viewed in relation to one anothee,
