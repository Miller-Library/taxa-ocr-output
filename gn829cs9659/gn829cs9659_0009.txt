a change in muscle cell membrane resistance with membrane potential.
That contraction will not be produced by a single or a few
junction potentials is demonstrated in figs. 5a, 5b 5c, and óa.
Multiple (at least 5-6) junction potentials must sum in time to doive
membrane potential begond threshold to cause contraction (fig. ób, 6c).
Uhile end-plate potentials fail to doive membrane potential more
positive than about -40 mU,  muscle cell can be depolapized fuothen
using a two microeleetrode protocol (see Tethods). Current pulses
are injected to obtain suprathreshold (for contraction) shocks, and
the presence or absence of action potentials can be observed. As
demonstrated in fig. 7, action potentials are not produced in the
fast fibers. This constitutes fatoly conclusive evidence that fast
fibees do not contract via an action potential propogating mechanism.
A rough estimate of input resistance can be calculated from
figure 7 if the entire fiber is treated as a behemoth resistor. A
value of about 50 Kohms is determined: this is considerably lowen than
for a frog tuitch fiben of approximately 100 Kohms (Katz, 1966).
Input resistance is directly proportional to junction potential
amplitude, and is an indicator of membrane cesistance. A lou R..
value implies a leaky resting membrane.
Involvement of extracellulap calctum in contraction:
The role of extracellular calcium in vertebrate contraction is
controversial and the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling
is unknoun. As indicated in figure 8, a Ca-free/5 mf EGTA solution
drastically decreases tension, and a Na-free/TIX (a verg specific
sodtum-channel blocker) solution has little effect on contraction.
These results can be explained if these fast twitch fibers are unlike
