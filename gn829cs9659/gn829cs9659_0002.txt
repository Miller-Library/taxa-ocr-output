INTRODUCTION
Uhile certain types of vertebrate muscle have been intensely
studied, relatively little work has been conducted on fish muscle.
Work done show several distinct pecullarities of fish muscle compared
to typical vertebrate musele (e.g., amphibtan, mammalian). Highen
teleost muscle (including the sand dab's family, Acanthopterggi)
utilizes an unusual type of fast fiber innervation. Each fast fiben
is multiply innervated (Barets, 1961; Hudson, 1969), not focally like
most other vertebrate fast muscle. This type of fast muscle innervation
has been previously reported onlg in lower vertebrates. However,
multiple innervation is usual for vertebrate non-action potential
producing slou fibers. In lower ventebrates, multiply innervated
fibers are slou and are used primarily for posture (Peacheg, 1961),
while in higher vertebrates such muscles have very spectalized function
(e.q., extraocular and middle ear muscles) (Bach-g-Rita and Ito, 1966).
Fish musele is claimed further atupical for vertebrates because fish
muscles studied thus fan lack sensong ongans knoun as muscle spindles.
Only a handful of electrophysiologic studies have examined fish
fast fibers. Tost studtes have found that muscle action potentials
are characterized by ovenshoots close to 0 mU on by failure to overshoot.
Spikes tupically appear as graded regenerative responses and are not
all-og-none (Hagtwara 8 Takahashi, 1967; Hidaka 2 Toida, 1969 Hidaka 4 Kuriggam
and Barets, 1961). Other vertebrate fast fibers do show overshooting,
all-or-nothing action potentials. Additionally, few studtes have
investigated propenties of isometoie contraction in these fast fibers.
Of a limited sampling of museles, seahoose fin muscle is reponted as
one of the fastest, with an isometric contraction time as shoot as
10 ms to peak, and shous a fusion frequeneg of 120 Hz (Bone, 1978).
