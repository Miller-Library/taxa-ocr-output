that are elicited by indirect shocks of the moton nerye fused?
Is this pechaps due to some type of sunaptic event or is it related
to the slowen decag of the junction potential; compared to that
following current injection from a microelectrode? Uhy also, does
depolapization to threshold of contraction hold at -40 mU and never
depolanize funther?
Uhat are the functional roles of these fibers in medtating
behavior of the fish? The fast fibers ace likely to be used in anu
fast fin movement, such as the characteristie burging, extension/
retraction of fins, and the initial elevation of fins in the cheotaxtic
response. In ooder to understand the functioning of the fast fibers
in celation to the other muscles that control fin movement,
knouledge of the basic properties of the other fin museles is
necessang. Speculation as to how the sand dab uses its museles for
different movements then would be more profitable.
Sand dab fast twitch muscles nepresent a highly unique solution
to the problem of fast, yet finely controlled movement with a
relatively simple motor neuron system. The mechanies of this sustem
compared to the mechanies of the typical vertebrate, action potential
propogating, singlg or dually innervated system will be of special
compacative interest. Such an analysis will lead to a more
comprehensive understanding of muscle diversitg.
