slou. Peak contraction occurs in 150-200 ms (not illustrated) and
celaxation verg slow (fig. 3c). Differenttation between the fibees
involved in the slow us. fast contraction can be done by watching
contraction through the microscope. Theg mag be fuother differentiated
bu excising the slou fibers from a whole muscle preparation. Figs 3b
and 3e shou the copresponding oscilloscope polaroids (3b) and chaot
recordings (3c) of tension recorded from a muscle before and aften
cemoyal of the slow fibeos. After cutting awag the short fibers foom
the long, the slow contraction is not seen, only the fast component
remains.
The fast twitch fibers respond to direct repetitive stimulation
of up to 200 Hz (3-20 y/cm, 0.75 ms duration) with tetani of increasing
amplitude (see fig. 4a). High gain oscilloscope traces of these
tetant (not illustrated) show that the response is still not completelg
fused at 200 Hz. Thus, the chart records in fig da appean inaccurately
fused due to the lou frequency response of the chant reconder.
Indirect stimulation via nerve shocks produced fused tetani even
at quite low frquencies, as depicted in fig. 4b. At 600 Hz, maintained
contraction fails. The reason for this is unknoun.
The fast fibeos display typical, strong, extended contractures
in response to K-glutamate (134 mm) (see table 1), caffeine (20 mm)
and acetylcholine (3.5 mm). Records ane not included in this paper.
A high potassium solution depolarizes the membrane, thus causing
contraction. Caffeine induces release of intracellular calcium reserves.
ACh is the presumed neupomuscular transmitter.
A saturated solution of dantrolene sodium and 12 x 10 *  D-600
showed no effect on long fiber tension output in cesponse to direct
electrical shocks. Dantrolene sodium blocks contraction in vertebrate
