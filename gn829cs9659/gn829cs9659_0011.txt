compose a system well-designed to produce fast, finely-controlled
movements. Threshold for contraction is reached via graded membrane
depolanizations. An all-on-none mechanism is not in operation in
these fibens and action potentials do not propogate. Thus this
system of local, graded depolarizations is capable of producing
sunchronous contraction along the length of the fibers (just like
usual vertebrate twitch muscles) if they indeed are multiplu
innervated as Bone (1978) suggests. Under this mechanism, usual
all-on-none action potentials would be unnecessarg.
At least five junction potentials in fairly rapid succession
appear to be necessany to activate contraction, though the exact
number and frequency remain unresolued at completion of this project.
As seen in figure รณ membrane potential reaches threshold fon
contraction (figure 9 shous -44 mU as mean e.p.p. threshold) several
junction potentials before an increase in tension begins. Similanlg,
it is not known precisely how e.p.p.s sum to grade tension output.
Very little if ang difference exists in the depolarizations produced
by 200 Hz us. 400 Hz nenve stimulation (figure 6), get tension due to
400 Hz stimulationis much greater. It should be remembered that the
steadu-state relation between tension and membrane voltage is
exceedingly steep at threshold in frog musele (Hodgkin X Horowicz,
1960). This makes comparision of electrical activity measured in a
single musele fiber with mechantcal activity reconded from the whole
muscle very difficult under the conditions of experiments like those
in figures 5 and 6.
Several other questions posed by the data also must remain
unanswered. Uhg, as indicated in figure 4, are tetani that ace
