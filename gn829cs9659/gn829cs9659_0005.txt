two volumes of new solution, followed by sloshing to disrupt ang
boundary layer around the muscle. For solution changes in which the
chamber was not inittally drained, four times volume was washed
through the chamber.
Experiments described in this report were conducted between
22 Tag 1984 and 1 June 1984.
RESULTS
Anatong:
The fast fin muscle fibers used for study are located along the
posterior end of the body, foom the pegions of doosal fins that ace
elevated during the pheotaxtic response (Ueland, 1984) (see fig. 1).
Two groups of fin museles exist with different onigins: 1) from bones
between the ocular and non-ocular myotome masses (see fig. 2a, arrow)
and 2) from the skin (see fig. 2a). The fin spine is the common
insertion of both types. Only the first type of muscle was studied
in the present report. As shown in fig. 2b, one fin spine is moved
by a total of four myotome-insenting museles. Of these four muscles,
an individual bundle from the ocular side was isolated for experimentation.
The accangement of fibers within a single bundle is diagrammed
in fig. 2b (fiber arrangement sketch). The fast fibers ace long and
run from a spine tendon to a tendon underneath the myotome mass (see
accou in fig. 2b). The superfictal long fibers are spindle -shaped
and have diametens of approximately 100at the centers of the fibers,
tapering doun to approximately 30at the spine end. These fibers ace
difficult to follou along their full lengths because theg weave and
insert among each other. Such weaving makes casual observation of
multiple innervation difficult, and a rigorous attempt to quantifg
