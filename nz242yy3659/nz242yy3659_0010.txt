occupied all the available hauling area. Subadults were observed gliding by these
sites, looking at the seals (juveniles) on the rocks, and proceeding to a different
site to haul out. Site 1 did not meet the above conditions for haul out, vet both
subadults and juveniles were seen at this hauling ground on four occasions. On
each of these days, the seals did not haul out until the area had been exposed to
the sun and wind for a minimum of three hours which made the algae less
slippery. No relation was apparent between area of hauling ground or distance to
escape channel and ability/preference of subadults and juveniles to haul out.
Pup haul out was also influenced by degree of incline and percent algal
cover. However, even more influential was the presence of other seals. An
inverse relation was observed between the presence of juveniles, subadults, or
male adults and the likelihood that a mother/pup pair would haul out at the same
site as these other individuals. But, if the other seals were another mother/pup
pair, haul out was quite likely. Once again, no relation was observed between
distance to escape channel and mother/pup preference to haul out.
DISCUSSION:
Tide height, wave action and disturbance can be said to be the classic
factors which have been studied in relation to overall haul out numbers. As with
other studies, this study showed an inverse relationship between tide height, wave
action, and disturbance with number of seals hauled out. However, with
reference to disturbances, seals were observed leaving a hauling ground in mass
although no apparent disturbance had occurred to produce such a reaction.
Because the tide height was always less than +1 foot when this occurred and these
seals always rehauled in a new area which had easy access to deep water, it is
possible that the escape channel at the original site had reached a critical
