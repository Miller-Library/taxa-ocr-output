INTRODUCTION:
The distribution of the harbor seal, Phoca vitulina, in the eastem Pacific
extends from Baja Califomnia, Mexico to the northern coast of Alaska (Knudtson
1977). Throughout its range, the harbor seal hauls out on a variety of substrates
which include: cobblestone and sandy beaches, sloping rock outcroppings and
rock platforms, emergent offshore tidal rocks, rocky shorelines with large
boulders and rubble, sandbars, mudflats, sheltered crevices or sea caves, and
tidepools (Riedman 1990). In addition to hauling out in order to give birth and
nurse its young, it has been postulated that hauling out is an important aspect of
maintaining the harbor seal's daily energy budget as it spends 44-50% of its time
hauled out (Riedman 1990, Sullivan 1982, Newby 1973). Several abiotic factors
have been recorded as influencing haul out behavior of harbor seals, such as: tidal
height (Scheffer and Slipp 1944, Venables and Venables 1955, Bishop 1968.
Loughlin 1974, Schneider and Payne 1983, Osbomn 1985); wave intensity
(Venables and Venables 1955, Bishop 1968, Schneider and Payne 1983, Slater
and Markowitz 1983); disturbance (Scheffer and Slipp 1944, Venables and
Venables 1955, Stewart 1984, Osbom 1985); and time of day (Stewart 1984.
Osborn 1985, Calambokidis et al 1987). In terms of biotic factors influencing
haul out, Bishop (1968) noted that the presence of other hauled out seals is an
important stimulus to general haul out. Furthermore, Sullivan (1982) and
Osborn (1985) reported that harbor seals have a greater tendency to haul out in
areas where other seals are resting than areas which contain no resting seals even
though the uninhabited areas are physically suited for haul out.
Many past researchers of harbor seal behavior have addressed the issue of
social organization among hauled out seals (Scheffer and Slipp 1944, Bishop
1968, Loughlin 1974, Knudtson 1977, Wilson 1978). These researchers either
