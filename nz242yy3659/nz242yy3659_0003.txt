supported or rejected the presence of social organization based on whether
individuals formed groups within the hauling ground area. More recently,
Sullivan (1982) and Osbom (1985) have commented on social organization by
noting that harbor seals of Humboldt Bay, California and Elkhom Slough,
California respectively form groups based on age and sex. Sullivan studied the
interactive and dominance behavior of the seals and provided a detailed analysis
on the effectiveness of various behaviors in obtaining and retaining haul out
space. Sullivan and Osborn both concluded that the observed age and sex
groupings were the result of a complex hierarchy system headed by adult males.
This paper addresses the age distribution of harbor seals hauling out on
irregularly shaped offshore rocks and presents data on substrate characteristics
which influence the age distribution of seals within the hauling grounds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
This study was conducted at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS), which is
located in the city of Pacific Grove at the souther tip of Monterey Bay,
California (see Map 1). This study was conducted from 4-22-91 to 5-27-91 for a
total of 127 hours of observation. The dimensions of the entire study area are
approximately 57 x 29 meters (see Map 2). Due to the close proximity of the
study area to shore, observations were made with the naked eye and with the aid
of binoculars. By using the natural boundaries formed by the irregular
configuration of the rocks, the study area was divided into 21 distinct hauling
grounds (see Maps 2-5). Only 2 of these hauling grounds are accessible at high
tide, and thus observations were conducted for the full duration of the daytime
ebbing tidal cycle.
