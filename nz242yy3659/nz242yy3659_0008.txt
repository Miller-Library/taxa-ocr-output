uncommon for a mother and pup to unsuccessfully haul out in several areas
before finding a rock that the pup could climb up and not be washed off by a
wave.
Although most hauling grounds were used by more than one age class, this
does not imply that different age classes always hauled out together in these areas.
This was significant for sites 3, 7, 9, 15, 16, and 17 where only once did more
than one age class use the hauling ground at the same time. All other hauling
grounds, except for site 14, were occupied by 2 or more age classes concurrently.
When the age classes mixed on the hauling ground, juveniles and subadults were
at times observed occupying areas higher up on the rocks than adults. The
distribution of the age classes was not constant throughout the daily haul out
period, nor was it consistent from day to day. On 10 occasions a juvenile was
observed hauling out later than an adult, yet the juvenile hauled out to a higher
position on the rocks.
Interactions among seals: Interaction among these seals was very limited.
Most seals seen eliciting social behavior on the rocks were mother/pup pairs.
Intra-pair behavior consisted of naso-naso contact, nursing, and scratching. Most
agonistic behavior seen was performed by mother seals protecting their pups
from other curious seals. These behaviors included growling and head thrusts
with and without biting. The only social interaction observed which did not
involve a mother/pup pair was a large adult which pushed a subadult off a rock so
that it could haul out onto the rock. There was no fighting among these two seals
the bigger one simply pushed the smaller one off into the water. Cuts and blood
were often seen on these seals, but these marks were not the result of a aggressive
battle on the hauling grounds. Rather, either the seals had the cuts at the time of
haul out, indicating they were the result of an in-water confrontation, or the
