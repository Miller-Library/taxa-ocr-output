Factors influencing the distribution pattern of different ages of hauled out harbor
seals were studied for a 5-week period in Spring 1991. Particular emphasis was
placed on the impact of substrate characteristics on the observed age distribution.
The seals in this area utilize irregularly-shaped offshore rocks for haul out.
Aggressive behavior was almost completely absent in this area and seals were
never observed battling over haul out space. Substrate features which were
examined included: distance to an escape channel; % total and individual algal
cover; size of hauling ground; and degree of incline to reach the hauling ground.
These features at least partly resulted in the observed segregation of ages as adults
were limited by the size of the hauling ground, while subadults and juveniles
were limited by the % algal cover and degree of incline. Social organization may
be an additional influence on the age-structured distributions, but the short term
of this study prevented any extensive investigation into the social structure of this
population.
