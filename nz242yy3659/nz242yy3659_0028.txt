ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
1 would like to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to our T. A.,
Terri Shaw. Her encouragement and willingness to discuss my project at
all stages was very beneficial and helped me to remain focused throughout
the quarter. I am also very thankful for Terri's frankness in pointing out
and discussing potential weakness, not only during the actual study but also
during the process of writing this paper. I would also like to thank my
fellow classmates Teri Nicholson and Kirsten Hackney for their help in
identifying individuals and discussing seal behavior at the neighboring Seal
Rock area. Finally, I would like to thank Alan Baldridge for always being
interested in my research and for sharing his insight and knowledge of the
harbor seals in this particular location.
