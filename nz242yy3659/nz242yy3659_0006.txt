applied to other hauling grounds. Some of the smaller areas (i.e. sites 3, 6, 7, 13,
17, and 19) consisted of small, single rocks, and in these cases the central width
and length were measured in meters and the mean taken if there was more than
one rock. Although adults were observed hauling out in these areas on a few
occasions, the same unit of measure was not used because: 1) adults very rarely
hauled out in these areas and 2) the entire body of the adult did not fit on the rock
- both its head and tail hung over the edges. Degree of inclination was measured
using a protractor with an attached plumb. The angle of the side of the rock used
for hauling out was measured and the mean taken if there were multiple haul out
routes to the hauling ground.
RESULTS:
Factors influencing overall haul out: Because only 9.5% (2 of 21) of the
hauling grounds were available at high tide, an inverse relationship was observed
between tide height and total number of seals hauled out. Wave action had a
varying effect on haul out in terms of the numbers of seals hauled out and their
distribution. Waves always approached the study area from the northwest. Due
to the position of the hauling sites, sites 1-13 and 19-21 always experienced wave
actions of the same intensity factor. Sites 1-13 and 19-21 received direct wave
action from the incoming ocean swells, yet these sites provided protection for
sites 14-18. A positive relationship was observed between the wave intensity
factor for sites 1-13 and 19-21 and the number of seals hauled out in the more
protected sites 14-18. A factor of 5 produced an overall average increase of
104% in haul out at sites 14-18; a 4 produced an overall average increase of 64%;
a 3 produced an average increase 36%; and factor of 2 had no significant effect
on haul out in sites 14-18. These percent-increases are based on the average
