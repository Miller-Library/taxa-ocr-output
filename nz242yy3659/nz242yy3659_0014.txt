would only haul out in close proximity to an escape channel. In fact, grouping
was thought to be the result of a limited number of sites with suitable escape
routes.
Opinions on the presence of age structure has also varied with the type of
substrate being used. Pitcher and McAllister (1981) and Pitcher and Calkins
(1983) studied seals on gravel beaches in the Gulf of Alaska. Neither study
observed age-structured grouping. Bishop (1968) studied harbor seal behavior
on sandy beaches in the Gulf of Alaska. He reported "strong gregariousness
among seals yet saw little social structure as the sexes and ages were often
intermixed. He did note that dominance was related to size and that there was
social pressure towards a spatially static group. On the other hand, Scheffer and
Slipp (1944), on mudflats, concluded that the seals were loosely gregarious.
Davis and Renouf (1987), observed a predictable age-structured arrangement on
sandbars, yet the seals failed to interact socially to a significant degree.
This study does not provide specific data on the relative influence of
substrate physical features and social organization on age-structured distributions.
Instead, it suggests that haul out behavior may first be guided by the physical
requirements of haul out. Then, working within these boundaries, the social
organization further dictates where each age class hauls out. This appears to be
especially true when the substrate being used for haul out is irregularly shaped
rocks, yet substrate physical features may not be as important a factor for other
substrates (i.e. beaches, sandbars, mudflats). This study does not discredit the
presence nor the importance of social structure within harbor seal populations.
Rather, it illustrates the need to consider the physical features of potential hauling
grounds before drawing conclusions on the significance of social organization
within a population.
