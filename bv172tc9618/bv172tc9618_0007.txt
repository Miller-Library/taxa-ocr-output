gray values than the histogram of sandy substrate. The histograms
documenting the change of gray values of the rocky fish before and after
acclimation to sand show that the spread of gray values is greatly
reduced after 8 days. The histograms of the sandy fish acclimating to
rock show little change except a general darkening (see Figures 12-15.)
DISCUSSION
Flatfish possess a large ability to change their patterns to adapt to
new substrates. The pattern is largely determined by the percent cover
within independent patch distributions of two different pigment
structures found in the speckled sanddab, melanophores and iridophores.
The melanophore is a reticulate cell that can disperse or concentrate the
dark pigment it contains, quickly varying its contribution to the
background shade. The iridophore contains intracellular layers of white
quanine crystals which are fixed in position. Iridophores can not quickly
vary their contribution to background shade like melanophores, (Hoar,
1969.) In an instantaneous change, the pattern and degree to which
existing melanophores are open is varied against the fixed background
pattern of tridophores. A morphological pattern change results in a
change of the total amount of pigment or net number of pigment cells
present. Morphological changes occur within melanophore patterns, but
may also occur more slowly with iridophore patterns. Acclimations
longer than 8 days would need to be performed to observe changes in the
patterns of tridophores.
The patterns of rocky and sandy fish are extremely different, yet
both types express some aspect of a basic pattern of black eyespots and
white dorsal, ventral, and lateral line spots. Observations through a
dissecting scope show that the black eyespots are composed mainly of
melanophores and the white spots are composed mainly of iridophores.
On a rocky fish, tridophores are densely packed to form the
