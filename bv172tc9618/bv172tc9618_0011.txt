takes 3 to S days to complete the matching. Rocky fish do not seem to be
limited by an insbility to background match when choosing between rock
and sand.
If Ã  cost to maintaining a rocky morphology does exist, then what
sort of benefits does a rocky fish recieve to counteract that cost? It
allows the fish to to exploit a habitat unavailable to their most
efffective competitors, members of the same species adapted to sandy
substrate. Perhaps Iiving on a rocky substrate provides access to better
food. More or tastier crustaceans may live within the gravel and broken
shells than in the sandy bottom. The sanddab may eat the algae that
settles or grows only on the rocky substrate. Perhaps the advantage is
less exposure to larger open water predators that may not come into the
shallow waters nearshore.
CONCLUSION
Rocky and sandy sanddabs both demonstrated an ability to change
their patterns to adapt to novel substrates. Rocky fish matched sand
better after 8 days of acclimation than sandy fish matched rock, which
was probably the result of the general trend for the fish in the
experiment to become more sandy. All fish displayed aspects of the
same basic pattern of iridophore spots, although the pattern was more
pronounced in the rocky fish. Since it is eastly highlighted or
de-accentuated, probably by the action of melanophores, this basic
pattern seems to offer a great deal of flexibility to the sanddab in
matching many grains of substrates.
