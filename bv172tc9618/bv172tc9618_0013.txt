ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Hopkins Marine Station in Pacif ic Grove California
is à poem, a stink, à grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a
nostalgia, a dream. Hopkins Marine Station is the gathered and scattered,
the pyrex dish, the plastic bucket, the broken gate and weedy lots and
hidden keys, sanddab fishtanks of corrugated iron, honky tonks(Agassiz),
restaurants(JC canyon), and whore houses(Hawthorne), and little crowded
groceries(Nob Hill), and laboratories(Lily), and flophouses(Fisher). Its
inhabitants are, as Chuck Baxter once said, "whores, pimps, gamblers,
and sons of bitches, by which he meant the Spring Class. Had the man
looked through another peephole he might have said, "Saints and angels
and martyrs and holy men of science," and he would have meant the same
thing.
would like to thank Chuck Baxter, my advisor, for the exchange of ideas,
be they in the form of taxonomic loquacities, insightful paper revisions,
or hasty pool shooting blather.
would like to thank Mark Denny, my secondary advisor, for all of his
help, advice, assistance, chicken curry, and fourrier transform
explanations.
would like to thank Ladd Johnson for taking some large chunks of time
to really sit (split infinitive) down and look at the data. l'Il name my
first ANOVA after you.
Iwould like to thank the Squid Festival for forcing Emily Carrington to
seek out strange new buddy forms for some amazing diversions. Here we
are on ze Calypso...
would like to thank Chris Patton for film, for opening up the door, and
for film.
And finally, would like to thank the words "rocky", "sandy", "acclimate"
and "substrate", without whose existence this paper would not have been
possible.
