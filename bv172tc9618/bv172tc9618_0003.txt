Sanddabs, Citharichthys stigmaeus, of sizes 6.5 to 11 cm. Fourteen of
these fish had sandy patterns and were collected from the sandy
substrate in the channel between Hopkins Harine Station and the
Monterey Bay Aquarium at a depth of 20 feet. The other 14 fish were
collected at a depth of 10 feet from the area between Seal Rock and the
railroad tracks off Agassiz Beach, where the substrate consisted of
gravel, broken shells, sandy patches, and algae fragments; these fish had
speckled morphologies (for map of collection sites, see Figure 1.) Since
there was within site vartability of substrate type, especially within my
designated type "rocky", I made 10 measurements with a 25 cm x 25 cm
transect at each of the two collection sites to quantify the makeup of
the substrates. The transect was haphazardly dropped and substrate
descriptions were recorded from the four corners and the center.
Fish were anesthetized with quinaldine and tagged with a color code
of embroidery beads sewed through the posterior dorsal muscle mass
with nylon thread.
Fish were maintained in two outdoor tanks with equal exposure to
s√ºnlight and fresh running seawater, each containing a substrate
collected from the two capture sites. Each 1.5 square meter tank
contained 7 experimental and 7 control fish. The fish were fed mussels
and squid every 4 days.
photographed each fish 8 hours after collection to record initial
pattern morphology. The fish were then placed in the tanks and
photographed 24 hours after initial acclimation and every 48 hours
thereafter to document the pattern change as adaptation to a different
substrate occurred. For photographing, fish were placed in a dish of
seawater with a gray scale and ruler as a background. They were
Iluminated with four 300 watt reflector flood lamps and photographed
using Agfa Pan 100 speed film in a 35 FM Nikon F2 camera mounted 22
cin above the dish. Photographs were also taken of the two substrates,
