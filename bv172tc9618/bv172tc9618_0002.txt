extremely different pigment patterns than the sanddabs on the adjacent
substrate of gravel, broken shells, and algal fragments closer to shore
This led me to ask two questions: How well and how quickly can
sanddabs match new backgrounds? Do these fish remain on the substrate
to which they are best adapted, or do they move about freely between
substrates?
Research on flatfish coloration shows that most species of flatfish
have the ability to change or adjust their color patterns using two
methods. There is an instantaneous color change, which is an immediate
and temporary lightening or darkening of the fish, and there is a
morphological change, which takes place over a longer period of time
resulting in a more permanent change in color or pattern. Conditions that
cause instantaneous pattern changes eventually lead to morphological
pattern changes (Brown, 1957.) Studies on plaice show that the young
fish, which are found nearshore, have semi-permanent white spots that
are not seen on adults, which live in the muddy bottom. However, when
the adult fish are placed on white pebbbles, these spots reappear
(Cott,1940.) Work with Paralichthys albiguttus demonstrates that this
fish can appear finely mottled when placed on a checkerboard of small
black and white squares and coarsely mottled on a checkerboard of large
squares (Parker, 1971.)
designed a set of experiments to answer my questions about the
background matching abilities and substrate fidelity of the Speckled
Sanddab. By placing different patterned fish on novel substrates,
observed that both rocky and sandy sanddabs possessed the ability to
alter their patterns to match new backgrounds, and that sandy fish
showed a grester fidelity to their substrate than rocky fish.
HATERIALS AND FETHODS
Using SCUBA gear and a small handnet, I collected 28 Speckled
