RESULTS
Pre-acclimation rocky fish had an average pattern score of 1.75,
whereas pre-acclimation sandy fish had an average pattern score of 4.48.
After the 8 day acclimation, rocky fish on rock became sandter by a
degree of 1.04; rocky fish on sand became sandier by 2.41 degrees. The
sandy fish on sand showed an increase in sandiness of 46 degrees,
whereas the sandy fish on rock became rockier by 53 degrees (See Table
and Figures 4-8). One-tailed, rank sum two sample tests show that
there is a significant difference between the pattern change of
experimental and control fish (p-.006 for rocky fish, p-03 for sandy
fish, see Table 1.) After 8 days of acclimation, rocky fish matched a
sandy substrate better than sandy fish matched a rocky substrate (See
Figures 9 & 10.)
When given the choice between rocky and sandy substrates, rocky
control fish chose the sand 56% of the trials. Sandy control fish
demonstrated a greater preference for sand by choosing the sandy
substrate 76% of the trials (See Table 2 and Figure 11) A Mann-whitney
statistical analysis was performed between the means of percent
preference for sandy substrate by rocky and sandy controls to
demonstrate that this difference is significant (p-.0025, see Table 2.)
Most of the visually obvious pattern changes of sanddabs acclimating
to a new substrate took place within the first 3 to 5 days. It was this
time range in which it became difficult to distinguish the differences
between photographs of the same fish (See Table 3.)
At the collection site for the sandy fish, the substrate consisted of
100% sand. However, at the collection site for the rocky fish, the
substrate was composed of 488 rocky gravel and broken shells coyered
with algae; 428 bare, finer gravel, and 102 sand, which was dispersed in
small patches ranging from 5 to 10 inches in diameter.
The histogram of rocky substrate shows a much greater spread of
