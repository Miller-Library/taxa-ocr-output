C
THE PATTERN CHANGE OF ACCLIMATION TO NOVEL GRAINED SUBSTRATES
OF THE SPECKLED SANDDAB
ABSTRACT
studied the pattern changing abilities of the Speckled Sanddab by
acclimating sandy patterned fish to a rocky substrate and rocky
patterned fish to a sandy substrate. Both rocky and sandy fish
demonstrated the ability to alter their pattern to match a nove
substrate. After 8 days of acclimation, rocky fish matched sand bettet
than sandy fish matched rock. Whether this was the result of all fish
becoming sandier af ter removal from the field is not certain. There may
be a cost to maintaining a rocky morphology. If so, it would be more
difficult for a sandy fish to gain a rocky morphology than it would for a
rocky fish to gain a sandy morphology. Sandy fish showed a greater
fidelity to their original substrate than rocky fish, indicating that a
lower ability to effectively match another substrate limits the freedom
afish displays in choosing a new substrate.
INTRODUCTION
Cryptic coloration is an important method of defense for many
animals. The ability to match a background effectively in the presence
of visual predators can be cructal for survival. Flatfish are among the
best camouf laged of all fish, with their ability to lie flat on the ocean
floor buried in the sand or mud. Ideally, a species using cryptic
coloration as a survival tool should be able to match any substrate on
which it is placed, yet most creatures naturally selected to match a
certain environment are limited in their abilities to adapt to novel
environments
