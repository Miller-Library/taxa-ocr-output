RESULTS
The vascular system in C. spirabrancha, as in most
polychaetes, can be viewed as a combination of two general
systems: a typical replicating segmental system, and a
longitudinal system which is superimposed upon the segmental
system.
The segmental system generally consists of a series of
contractile vessels which move blood through a roughly
circular pathway within each segment. The major vessels
of this system (see Figure 1,A) are the ventro-lateral
vessels (VL), the dorso-lateral vessels (DL), the medioÂ¬
lateral vessels (ML), the medio-ventral vessel (MV), and
the branchia supply vessels (BS).
The longitudinal system consists of five major vessels
(see Figure 1,A): the dorsal vessel (DV), the supra-esophageal
vessel (SV), the ventral vessel (VV), and paired lateral
vessels (LV). These vessels communicate indirectly with
each other through the segmental system except in the
modified anterior segments and the pygidium, where the
dorsal and ventral vessels communicate directly in the
terminal anal segmental ring.
Proceeding along the longitudinal axis of C. spirabrancha,
variations appear in the vascular anatomy of both the
longitudinal and segmental systems. These differences appear
