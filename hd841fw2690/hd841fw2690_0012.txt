Cirratulids, are especially interesting. Superimposed upon
the general dorsal-anterior, ventral-posterior longitudinal
flow pattern with its segmental interconnections, these
vessels make up a "sub-system" concerned specifically with
providing the lateral branchia with a constant blood supply.
The efferent vessels in these branchia lead directly into
vessel LV. Here the blood is able to mix with blood moving
dorsally in the segmental system. This provides a reasonably
efficient system for the supply of oxygenated blood to the
various tissues. This "sub-system" does not appear homologous
to any of the branchial supply systems found in the other
polychaetes reviewed.
Another interesting feature of the vascular anatomy of
C. spirabrancha is the anterior extension of the supraÂ¬
esophageal vessel which supplies the capillary network of
the pharynx and prostomium. In a closely related species,
A. tentaculata, Courtney (1958) described a direct connection
of the supra-esophageal vessel with the dorsal vessel in
segment 7. The dorsal vessel, rather than terminating as
in C. spirabrancha, proceeds anteriorly to supply these
capillary networks. Due to the cursory nature of Courtney's
paper, this connection may have been misinterpreted in
A. tentaculata; however, anatomical differences of this sort
do exist in closely related species of other families of
polychaetes.
Although there are some 70 (f) branchia present in
