posterior segments of this section, both vessels PV and DL
are lacking; vessels ML connect directly to vessels LV.
Ventrally, vessel SIV is not present; it is replaced by a
direct connection between the gut plexus and the ventral
vessel.

Flow Patterns and Vascular Activity
The general pattern of flow through the vascular system
of C. spirabrancha is a partial interdigitation of two
sub-patterns. The intra-segmental pattern of flow is generally
circular. Blood moves ventrally from vessel SV through the
gut plexus to the ventral vessel, then flows dorsally through
vessel LV and vessel DL. Flow is then latero-medial through
vessel ML back to vessel SV. Superimposed upon this pattern
is the rather sluggish dorsal-anterior to ventral-posterior
longitudinal flow pattern.
The actual volume displacement, and in some vessels the
direction of flow, is dependent upon the activity of the
animal. The motivating force for blood flow is supplied
by local contractions of muscular vessels walls. The activity,
spreading along a vessel as a contractile wave, causes
displacement of a volume of blood from one portion of the
system to another. These contractile waves are irregular
and frequently conflict with one another. Injury or
irritation to a vessel at any point will set up contractile
waves in both directions. This may cause flow to cease
or to be reversed.
