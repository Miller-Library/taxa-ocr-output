C. Histology of the Blood Vessels
With the exceptions of the ventral and lateral vessels,
the blood vessels of C. spirabrancha are all contractile.
Hanson (1949) stated that the blood vessel walls of Polychaetae
and Oligochaetae are composed of three layers: (1) an
endothelium occasionally appearing as a continuous layer,
(2) a layer of collagenous connective tissue, and (3) an
outer peritoneal layer, either differentiated into a muscle
coat, or, more often, with contractile fibers in the tails
of stellate cells. Most of the blood vessels in this species
follow this basic plan. Stellate cells occur on the walls
of all segmental vessels and on the walls of the vessels
within the branchia.
A heavy muscular coat surrounds both the lateral vessels
and the dorsal vessel. A thin band of connective tissue and
a thin endothelium occur in the dorsal vessel; a thick layer
of connective tissue occurs in the lateral vessels. The walls
of the supra-esophageal vessel are composed of only two
distinct layers: a connective tissue layer and a peritoneal
layer of occasional stellate cells with contractile fibers
radiating from them.
DISCUSSION
Although the blood vascular system of C. spirabrancha
follows the general pattern of closed circulatory systems found
in the class Polychaetae, it provides several anatomical
surprises. The lateral vessels, found only in certain other
