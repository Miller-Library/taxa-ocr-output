Blood is supplied to the prostomium and pharynx from
the supra-esophageal vessel. This is a remarkedly inefficient
means of providing freshly oxygenated blood to these tissues,
since no direct connectives exist between any of the branchia
and this vessel. It is likely that this problem is solved
by a rapid movement of blood into this area. Evidence for
this conclusion is limited, but it has been observed that
when the prostomium is removed from intact worms, profuse
bleeding occurs.
An attempt was made to compare the vascular anatomy of
C. spirabrancha to that of other members of the family
Cirratulidae. The literature on the family is quite limited
and the works which do exist are generally cursory and
incomplete. Therefore, although the vascular anatomy
exhibits certain similarities to that described for both
A. tentaculata and C. cirratus, the dissimilarities between
these three species and the others studied are such that no
general scheme for the family can be described.
