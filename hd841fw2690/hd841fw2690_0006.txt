ascribed a mechanical function to the dorsal vessel in
Cirratulids. It is not unreasonable to apply this conclusion
to C. spirabrancha, since at systole, the lumen is completely
obliterated by the contraction of the walls against the
heart body. Kennedy and Dales (1958) examined the heart body
in a related species, Audorina tentaculata, by long paper
chromatography of extracts and other methods. They concluded
that in addition to the possible mechanical function, the
heart body is also a haematopoetic organ.
The dorsal vessel is not continuous through Section I.
It tapers somewhat in segments 9, 8, and 7, and in segment 6,
the lateral vessels (LV) branch off from it. The dorsal vessel
itself then bifurcates to form the dorsal branchia vessels (DBV).
In its course through Section II, the dorsal vessel is
about 5 mm. in diameter, narrowing to 2 mm. when passing through
a septa. It is directly connected to the supra-esophageal
vessel (SV) in each segment by a thin-walled vessel just
posterior to the septa.
At the posterior end of Section II, the dorsal vessel
joins vessel SV and, throughout Section III, communicates
directly in each segment with the capillary net about the
gut and with vessel DL (see Figure 1,B).
Vessel SV, lying just ventral to the dorsal vessel and
directly above the gut is continuous throughout Section II.
In each segment, one, two, or three small vessels branch from
it and supply a capillary network about the gut. On the
