an individual worm, only five to ten of these are exposed
above the substrate surface at any one time. No particular
ratio of exposure could be established between the two
different types. This presents an interesting problem,
since these two types of branchia appear to differ only in
vascular anatomy. No special experiments were performed to
determine if any functional differences existed. When the
worm is exposed to an anaerobic environment, however, it
has been observed that the lateral branchia become turgid
with blood, while the dorsal branchia maintain their normal
ebb and flow. This would seem to indicate that the lateral
branchia are more efficient respiratory organs, since a much
greater amount of blood is thus exposed for gas exchange.
Considered from a functional standpoint, the total
circulation in C. spirabrancha does not present itself
as a very efficient process. The lack of valvular structures
in the connectives of the lateral vessels (LV) and the dorsal
branchial vessels (DBV) with the dorsal vessel is particularly
interesting.
Blood flow into both the lateral vessels and the dorsal
branchia must be very nearly random. Blood returning to the
dorsal vessel from the dorsal branchia may flow into the
lateral vessels, back into the dorsal vessel, or even
return to the dorsal branchia. Flow into the lateral vessels
is also uncontrolled. Since the lateral vessels are probably
important in respiration, this is not particularly favorable.
