MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of C. spirabrancha were collected from shallow
mud flats near the Municipal Pier, Monterey, California.
The course of all the major vessels and most of the
smaller branches was traced by dissection under a binocular
dissecting microscope. Doubtful connections between vessels
and the course of smaller ones were confirmed by the
examination of serial sections.
For dissection, the worms were lightly anesthetized in
a solution of magnesium chloride and seawater. The region
of dissection was then painted with 1% novocaine, permitting
extensive surgery without excessive muscular stimulation.
The anesthetized worms, when dissected, were allowed to revive
in fresh seawater. The vessels thus exposed continued to
exhibit what was assumed to be normal contractile behavior
for periods of one hour or more. To determine flow patterns,
india ink was injected into the vessels at various points. In
most cases, the india ink quickly settled on the vessel wall
near the point injected. However, a few specks would
occasionally remain in solution, allowing observation of flow.
For microscopic examination, the worms were fixed in
Bouin's fluid and the sections stained with the Foote-Goldner
modification of Masson's trichrome (Jones, 1950).
