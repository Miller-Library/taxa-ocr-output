The vascular anatomy of the Annelid worms has, in
general, been little studied. This is especially true of
marine worms of the class Polychaeta. The errent polychaetes
(Errantia) seem to have received most of the attention; there
are, for example, very adequate studies of the families
Nephtyidae and Nereidae. The sedentary forms (Sedentaria)
and those forms which cannot be easily placed into either
grouping have generally escaped serious study. A prime
example of this lack is the more or less sedentary family
Cirratulidae. A detailed study of the vascular anatomy of
Chartozone was done by Meyer in 1887; more general works
exist on Audorina filagera and Cirratulus Setosa (Claparede,
1873), Cirratulus cirratus (Picton, 1898 and Courtney, 1958),
Dodecaceria concharum, and Audorina tentaculata (Courtney,
1958).
Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore, 1904) is a member of
this family in which the vascular anatomy has not been
examined. In order to add to the limited knowledge of
polychaete vascular anatomy, and also for the challenge and
enjoyment of working with a completely unexamined species,
g. spirabrancha was chosen for this study. The vascular
organization, blood flow pattern, and blood vessel structure
have been examined in detail.
