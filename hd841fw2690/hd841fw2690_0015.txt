SUMMARY
1. The anatomical organization of the vascular system of
g. spirabrancha has been studied in detail. Blood flow
patterns and the fine structure of the blood vessels
were worked out.
The most striking observation was the discovery of a very
specialized branchial supply system. This system consists
of a pair of non-contractile lateral vessels which branch
from the dorsal vessel in segment 6 and run posteriorly
throughout the entire worm. In each segment, branches of
this vessel run into the lateral branchia.
No mechanical heart or hearts were found. The circulation
of blood appears to occur as a result of a combination of
three factors: contractile waves moving cephalad in the
dorsal and supra-esophageal vessels, local contractions
moving along individual vessels, and movements involving
the entire worm.
The main flow patterns are shown to consist of an
interdigitation of two circulatory systems, one a primitive
segmental type, and the second a posterior-anterior flow
involving the whole worm. Neither system is independent
of the other and no valvular structures were found. The
result is that actual flow is often sluggish and quite
inefficient in most of the worm.
5. An intravasal structure called the "heart body" was found
