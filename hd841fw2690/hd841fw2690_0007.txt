posterior side of each septa, the medio-lateral vessels
(ML) branch off from vessel SV and proceed laterally,
joining vessel DL. In Section I (see Figure 2), vessel
SV continues beyond the terminus of the dorsal vessel. In
segment 4, two small vessels branch from it and enter the
dorsal muscle mass. In segment 1, vessel SV branches, again,
the dorsal branch bifurcating to form the dorsal prostomial
vessels (DPV); the ventral branch forming the supra- pharyngeal
vessel (SPV). Vessels DPV supply the extensive capillary
network in the body wall of the prostomium. Vessel SPV
opens into the capillary net surrounding the pharynx.
The circum-oral vessels (CO) drain these capillary
networks and in segment 1, join to form the ventral vessel
(VV). In segments 1-5, the ventral vessel receives blood
from the lateral branchia through the latero-ventral
vessels (LV). These branchia are supplied from a small
vessel (ST) which runs along the exterior wall of the pharynx
and drains the capillary network surrounding it. In segment
2, a branch proceeds dorsally from the ventral vessel, then
bifurcates to form two smaller vessels which run to the
individual nephridia.
After the lateral vessels (LV) branch from the dorsal
vessel in segment 6, they proceed ventrally to the lateral
midline and then continue posteriorly throughout Sections
II and III. These vessels usually terminate in blind endings
approximately five segments anterior to the pygidium. In each
