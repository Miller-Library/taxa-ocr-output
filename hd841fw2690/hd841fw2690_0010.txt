The dorsal longitudinal vessel is the main contractile
vessel. The peristaltic waves which pass along it originate in
the segments just anterior to the terminal anal segmental
ring and sweep cephalad. In Section II, both the supraÂ¬
esophageal vessel (SV) and the dorsal vessel are involved,
contracting simultaneously. As the contractile wave reaches
the junction of vessels LV and DBV with the dorsal vessel,
blood flows into both the dorsal branchia and the lateral
vessels. In vessel SV, the wave of contraction ceases near
segment 9 and only slight contractions are observed anterior
to this.
In an unanesthetized worm which has been secured to a
dissecting pan in such a way that only limited movements are
possible, blood flow in the non-contractile ventral vessel
is scarcely perceptible. Flow here is probably dependent
almost exclusively on body movements. In the lateral
vessels (LV), contractile waves have not been observed, and
blood flow here is probably also dependent upon body movements.
The flow into and out of the lateral branchia appears to
result from the extension and contraction of these organs.
When the branchia are severed close to the body wall, blood
flow from the body through the open vessels is minimal;
however, when the distal end of the organ is removed, blood
flows quite readily.
