segment, a branch from the lateral vessel (LV) either
enters a branchia, if one is present, or ends abruptly at
the body wall.
As mentioned above, the segmental vascular organization
throughout Section II repeats itself in each segment (see
Figure 1,A). The medio-lateral vessels (ML) run from vessel
SV to vessels DL which lie just inside the dorsal muscle
band. Vessels DL connect dorsally to vessels PV, a pair
of small vessels which run the length of the worm. Vessels
PV supply both the dorsal muscle band and the dorsal body
wall through a series of small branches. Vessels DL run
ventrally from their connections with vessels ML, joining
vessels LV and the efferent branchial vessels in small
bulbs near the lateral body walls. Vessels LV run from these
bulbs to the ventral vessel (VV) with small branches supplying
both the ventral and lateral muscle bands. In each segment,
the gut capillary plexus is supplied from vessel SV and drains
into the sub-esophageal vessel (SIV) which runs directly to
the ventral vessel.
In Section III, the segmental vascular pattern is
repeated as above, but there appears to be a general gradation
of development from the fully developed segments of Section
II posteriorly to the pygidium. Figure 1,B is a diagram of
a section through a typical posterior segment. Here the
segmental vessels connect directly to the dorsal vessel
and vessel ML connects directly to vessel PV. In the most
