principally between the anterior, central, and posterior
sections of the worm. For purposes of discussion, these
sections are labelled I, II, and III.
Section I refers to the prostomium and anterior segments
1-7. This section is characterized by the extensive modification
of both the longitudinal and segmental vascular systems and
by the presence of dorsally placed branchia on segment 6.
Section II refers to the fully developed central
portion of the worm, segments 10 through 200 (approximately).
Despite minor variations in individual segments, the
organization of the vascular anatomy here follows a consistent
pattern. At the posterior end of this region, the
longitudinal system is reduced by the joining of the dorsal
and supra-esophageal vessels. Lateral branchia occur in
almost every segment in this section.
The posterior 100 (*) segments and the pygidium are
referred to as Section III. Here, four longitudinal vessels
are superimposed upon a segmental system which is similar to
that of Section II. The major difference is a progressive
simplification of the segmental system, proceeding posteriorly.
A. Vascular Anatomy
The dorsal vessel, suspended in a thin connective tissue
mesentary below the dorsal muscle band, is continuous throughÂ¬
out Sections II and III. In Section II, a loose, spongy,
intravasal organ commonly called the heart body is present.
