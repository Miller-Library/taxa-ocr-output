heaviest in the intertidal regions (Straughan, 1971).
Most of the species common to this region are sedentary
and for that reason cannot escape the noxious irritants
around them. Organisms that can migrate are indirectly
hurt when their food supplies in the intertidal communities
are depleted by excessive pollution.
Echinoderms are known to be extremely sensitive
to petroleum products. North et. al. (1965) pointed
out that after the "Tampico Maru" accident, the immediate
mortalities of echinoderms were considerable, and the
number of echinoderms was still noticeably reduced
seven years later. Sea urchins in particular were
effected, and North found that a 0.1% emulsion of the oil
inactivated the tube feet and was lethal in one hour.
Moreover, even weathered tanker oil reduced the success
of fertilization and caused abnormalities in the resulting
larvae (Elmhirst, 1922, as reported by Nelson-Smith, 1970).
Because of the urchin's sensitivity to water quality and
their common intertidal occurrence, I tested the sensitivity
of the development of this animal to the toxicities of
various petroleum products.
Methods and Materials
Oil samples were obtained from the Standard Oil
Company of California, the Union Oil Company of
California, and the Petrolite Corporation in Saint Louis.
