was repeated three tines. The mean, variance, and
standard deviation was calculated for each oil sample
and the controls in each series. In all cases the standard
deviation was less than ten. Calculations were done on
each sample to determine what concentrations differed
from the control in their series at the 5% level of
uncertainty.
Results
Most of the oil samples did not seem to have much
of an effect on the ability of the sperm to fertilize
the eggs. Fertilization in the majority of the samples
was not significantly different from the controls even
at the highest oil concentrations. (Table I). The
one exception to this finding was the Residual Heating
Oil 45. Fourteen percent of the eggs in the 12.5%
dilution of this oil sample did not fertilize, and this
figure was significantly different from the percentages
of non-fertilization obtained with the controls. The
46 Bunker Oil also proved to be somewhat toxic to fertilization,
but only at 50% or greater oil saturation.
Cleavage was more sensitive to the toxic effects
of petroleum fractions. At the two hour stage, eleven
out of the sixteen different kinds of oil tested
showed effects significantly different from the controls
even in the most dilute concentration (Table II,
Figure I). In some instances, cleavage was totally
