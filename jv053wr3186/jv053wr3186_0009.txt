is interesting to note that many of the oil
samples that had the greatest toxic effect on fertilization
less
had the-least toxic effect on fertilization and vice
versa. For example, the 4-Corner Grude, which was the
most toxic sample at the two hour stage and still very
toxic at the four hour stage, was among the least toxi-
o fertilization. Bunker Fuel Oil and Waxy Crude Oil
were not very toxic as far as fertilization was concerned
but both were fairly toxic to cleavage. In contrast
the Bunker Oil K6 from the Union Oil Company seemed to
be highly toxic to both fertilization and to cleavage.
As was previously mentioned, the purple sea urchin
was chosen as the test organism because of its noted
sensitivity to pollutants in the marine environment.
This fact also explains why the urchin might not have
been the best animal to use. Due to the urchin's
sensitivity, it is difficult to determine gradations
of toxicity between samples, because most of the sample
appear to be highly toxic. The urchin, perhaps, would
e better used to detect subtle changes in toxicity
that occur in one particular sample over a period of
time due to weathering, or in very low dilutions.
In addition to investigating the initial toxicities
these petroleum products, it will be important to
letermine the toxic effects to urchins after exposure
to the oil over a considerable period of time. It may
