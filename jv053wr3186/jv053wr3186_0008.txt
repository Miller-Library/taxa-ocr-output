Alteration of these compounds occurs mainly through
dissolution and biological degradation. Many feel that
the effects of evaporation and biological degradation on
reducing the toxicities of oils have been over estimated.
Blumer (1970), even concluded that weathering increases
rather than decreases the toxicity of oils. His results
showed that degradation removes straight and branched chain
fractions, yet it is the remaining aromatics that are the
more highly toxic. Thus, as the straight and branched
fractions are removed by degradation, the toxicity
increases due to an increased aromaticity. However,
Shelton (1971) stated that the aromatics are rapidly lost
during weathering, and therefore, crude oils lose their
toxicity in time.
Of the two processes, fertilization and cleavage,
fertilization was the least sensitive to the toxic
effects of oils. In all my cleavage tests, I found
crude oils and heavy bunker oils to be more inhibiting
than the more highly refined petroleum products, possibly
because the process of refining itself removes many of
the more toxic fractions. This too, differs from the
report of Shelton (1971). He concluded that, although
the light refined products are the least persistent,
they are the most highly toxic. He also maintained that
apart from the light refined oils, petroleum products
are not highly toxic substances.
