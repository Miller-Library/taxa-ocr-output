arrested. The more highly refined petroleum products
were less toxic than the heavier crudes and bunker oils.
Only the Jet Fuel JP-8 did not have an effect different
from the control.
Four hours after fertilization, fourteen out of the
sixteen oil samples showed effects different from the
controls at the 6.25% oil concentration. (Table III,
Figure II). In general, the samples that were highly
toxic to cleavage after two hours were still the most
highly toxic after four hours. Again, it was the crudes
and the bunker oils that had the most inhibiting effect
on cleavage, and the Jet Fuel JP-8 that had the least effect.
Discussion
Crude oils and petroleum products differ in
composition and consequently they differ in toxicity. Some
crude oils contain virtually only carbon and hydrogen
(Dean, 1968). The major non-hydrocarbons in other crude
oils are sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, and oxygen
compounds. Petroleum products contain four main classes
of hydrocarbons: alkanes, olephins (except in crudes).
naphthenes, and aromatics. The composition of oil also
effects the dispersal of oil at sea, and how readily it
forms emulsions. There are two basic types of petroleum
products, the persistent oils including crudes, residuals.
lubricating oils and sludges, and the light fuel oils
including kerosene and the various gasolines.
