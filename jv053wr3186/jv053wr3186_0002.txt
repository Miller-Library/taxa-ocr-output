Introduction
Pollution from crude oils and other oil products,
while not a recent phenomenon, has steeply increased
during the last decades. An estimated five to ten tons
of crude oil and its derivitives are released into
the ocean each year (Blumer et. al., 1971). Most of
the pollution occurs in shipping lanes and in biologically
productive coastal regions. World consumption of
petroleum derivitives represents 60% of the tonnage
of goods transported by sea (International Conference on
Oil Pollution of the Sea, 1968). This large scale
transport is being done with ever increasing bulk
carriers with an accompanying degree of unavoidable
spillage.
In the past decade, especially after the "Torrey
Canyon" spill in 1967, much research has been done on
the toxicities of the detergents used to clean up the
oil after the spill (Smith, 1968), but little has
been done on the actual toxicities of the oils themselves.
The aftermath of the "Tampico Maru" accident, in which
eight thousand tons of diesel fuel were spilled in a small
cove on the coast of Baja California in 1957, showed
that oil left without mechanical or chemical treatment
can still have serious toxic effects on the marine
Mitche
environment (North et. al., 1965; Anderson et. al., 1970).
