Abstrac
etroleum products vary considerably in their
composition, and consequently, they differ in toxicity
to living systems. In this study, the effects of
various dilutions of different kinds of oils were
tested on the fertilization and early development of
the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Most
of the oils had little effect on the fertilization,
but many of them did inhibit early cleavage. Crude
oils and heavy bunker oils were the most toxic to
cleavage, even at concentrations of 6.25% saturation, while
the diesel and jet fuels were the least toxic.
