well be that those fractions that do not appear to be
very toxic on an acute level are extremely toxic after
prolonged exposure. The chronic toxicities of residual
fractions are unknown. It would also be interesting
to test the oils on the larvae of these organisms
because they might be very sensitive to different adverse
environmental conditions than the gametes and embryos.
Summary
From these results the following conclusions
can be drawn:
1. Early cleavage in sea urchins is more sensitive to
the toxic effects of most petroleum products than
fertilization.
2. The crude oils and bunker oils have the most toxic
effects on cleavage, while the more refined diesel and
jet fuels have the least.
3. Many of the oils that were the most toxic to cleavage
Less
were the-least toxic to fertilization and vice versa.
4. Bunker Oil 46 from the Union Oil Company was very
toxic to both fertilization and cleavage.
