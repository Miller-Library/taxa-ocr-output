oil-in-sea water solution), 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25%.
These dilutions were then used to test the effects
of the petroleum fractions on the fertilization and
early development of the urchin.
Purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus,
were obtained from Pigeon Point, California, and
maintained in running sea water at Hopkins Marine
Station. The urchins were spawned by injecting them
with 0.5 ml. of a 0.5 M solution of KCl. For the
fertilization tests, the sperm were added to the dilutions,
left five minutes, and then the eggs were added, so that,
in actuality, it was the ability of the sperm to survive
exposure to the test solutions and fertilize the eggs
that was being tested. Aliquots of the eggs were removed
after two minutes with a pipette, and the percentage of
fertilization versus non-fertilization out of one hundred
eggs was determined under a microscope. In testing for
effects on cleavage, the eggs were fertilized in less than
0.5 ml. of sea water, then added to 5 ml. of each of the
dilutions two minutes later. Cleavage versus non-cleavage
out of one hundred fertilized eggs was checked after
two hours, and the percentage of fertilized eggs at
the four cell stage or less was checked after four hours.
One hundred eggs were counted in each test. All experiments
were conducted at 15Â° C. Controls were run in sea water
with each series of dilutions.
