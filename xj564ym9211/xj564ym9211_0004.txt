However, the result of this method could be assessed by the
examination of shells. Shells of limpets subjected to this
form of attack had lost the peak of the shell above the
muscle scar (see Plate 1). A total of seventeen shells with
the tops removed were taken from the aquaria containing the
crabs. Such shells were never found in any other tanks.
Several shells were found that had deep scratch marks on
them that were possibly made by the crab's chelipeds exertÂ¬
ing pressure on the shell. The scars were randomly oriented
on the shell and were found distributed over the entire sur-
face of the shell.
Attempts were made to mechanically duplicate the
possible squeezing action of the chelipeds by means of a
pair of needle-nose pliers suspended from a stand above the
limpet, so that only a lateral pressure was exerted between
the points. These experiments indicate that there is a
fracture zone or weak area that encircles the shell just
above the point of attachment of the shell muscles. This
zone seems to be present in all Acmaea species studied, but
it is most pronounced in the shells of Acmaea limatula where,
if a pressure of just two pounds was applied with the pliers.
the shell might break. The maximum pressure needed to break
an Acmaea limatula shell along the shear zone was seventeen
pounds at the tips of the pliers.
