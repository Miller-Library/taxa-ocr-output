Studies on factors influencing the shell breakage
showed it is important to exert the pressure exactly on the
very narrow shear zone. The shells were most easily broken
if the tips of the pliers were placed on the longitudinal
axis rather than the lateral axis. When the pressure was
exerted below the shear zone, one Acmaea limatula shell
withstood a pressure of forty-five pounds. The same shell
broke when a pressure of twelve pounds was exerted at the
shear zone. If the shells were artificially broken in this
manner, they did not always produce a clean circular break.
The remaining shell fragments, however, could very easily
be broken back to the shear zone but no farther so that a
very even break could be achieved.
A second set of experiments were run in which a
cheliped that had recently been removed from a crab was
used to exert pressure on the shells in the same manner
that the pliers were used. The results of these experiments
indicated that the cheliped could puncture the shell at the
fracture zone as easily or more easily than the pliers
although no exact pressures were recorded. The cheliped
did not suffer any damage when the pressure was applied.
By having the crab squeeze a piece of balsa wood.
and then duplicating the damage with pliers with about the
same squeeze area, it was possible to make a very crude
determination of the pressure that could be exerted by the
