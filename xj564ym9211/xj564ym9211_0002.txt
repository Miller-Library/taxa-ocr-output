Species of the genus Acmaea are distributed throughout
the rocky intertidal zone of the California coast in associÂ¬
ation with a variety of animals potentially predaceous on
these limpets.
Predation on Acmaea by the fish, Gibonsia elegans Hubbs
1929 was observed by Mitchell (1953). A continuation of
this work by Johnston (1953) indicated that Oligocottus
snyderi, Greeley; Gibonsia metzi, Hubbs 1929; and Gobiesox
maeandricus (Girard, 1858) were also occasionally found with
limpets in their gut. Frank (1965) has presented evidence
that Leptoplana may be predaceous on some species of Acmaea
on the Oregon coast. The other major predator reported in
the literature is the starfish (Bullock, 1953; Feder, 1959).
Recorded here are observations of predation by the crab,
Pachygrapsus crassipes, Randall, 1839, a previously un-
recognized predator of these molluscs.
