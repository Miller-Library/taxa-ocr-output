crab. With this method, it was found that the pressures
exerted by the crab exceeded twenty-three pounds, which is
more than any pressure needed to artificially break a limpet
shell at the shear zone.
Surveys of the intertidal on Mussel Point indicate
that shells from which the peaks have been removed make up
about fourteen percent of the total Acmaea shells cast up
on the beach. Such shells were often not highly eroded and
the loss of the peak did not appear to be due to erosion
after the death of the limpet.
SUMMARY
The crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, has not previously
been recognized as an important predator of limpets. Labor¬
atory observations and experiments suggest that the crab çan
remove the tops of the shells of some limpets by squeezing
with the cheliped, thus making the viscera available for
food. The results of a survey of the shells cast up on
the beach, and the numbers of limpets apparently attacked
by this method in the laboratory, suggest that these animals
may be responsible for a significant mortality in limpet
populations.
