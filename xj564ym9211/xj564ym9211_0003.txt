MATERIALS:
The following limpet species were included in the
study: Acmaea scutum, Eschscholtz, 1833; Acmaea digitalis,
Eschscholtz, 1833; Acmaea limatula, Carpenter, 1864; Acmaea
pelta, Eschscholtz, 1833; and Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1864).
These animals and P. crassipes were collected between Mussel
Point and Cypress Point on the coast of Monterey County,
California, and studied both in the field and in the
laboratory.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Pachygrapsus crassipes was never observed attacking
Acmaea in the field. In the laboratory, when left undis-
turbed, the crab sometimes made as many as five attacks in
three hours. While all limpets were preyed upon, crabs
preferentially attacked Acmaea limatula.
Pachygrapsus crassipes had two methods of attacking
its prey. The first was simply to pry the limpet off the
rock with its cheliped. This method was successfully used
if the limpet did not have its shell clamped to the rock
surface and the crab could get underneath the edge.
Animals attacked in this manner showed a characteristic
chipping of the edge of the shell. This method was used
most often on Acmaea scutum and Acmaea digitalis. The
second method of attack was never directly observed.
