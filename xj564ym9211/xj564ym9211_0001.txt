CHAPIN, DEXTER (Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, Calif.,)
Some Observations of Predation on Acmaea Species by the
Crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes. (Mollüsca:Gastropoda: Prosobranchia)
(Arthropoda:Crustacea:Decapoda). The Veliger
Predation om Acmaea populations by various predators including
the crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes was studied. Laboratory observations
and experiments indicate that the crab can remove the peak of an


Acmaeg shell by applying pressure with the cheliped on a fracture

aone enciroling the shelll above the muscle scar. The results of a
survey of Acmaea shells cast up on the beach at Pacific Grove,

Galifornia, and the number of limpets dispatched by the crabs im
the laboratory indicate that Pachygrapsus crassipes is responsible
for sigmificant mortality in limpet popullations.
