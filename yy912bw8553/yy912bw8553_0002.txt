Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
Within the Crustacean genus Isopoda, females of most spe¬
cies brood their young in a ventral marsupium, formed by five
pair of oostegites which cover the first five thoracic segments,
The young emerge as fully developed, miniature adults, except
that they lack the last pair of thoracic legs. Speculations
have been made about the kind and degree of protection offered
by the brood pouch (Verhoeff 1920), but little is actually
known. Young isopods, especially these in the marsupium, can¬
not move from adverse microclimates as readily as adults. They
have a narrower range of tolerance to stress, for example, they
are more susceptible to desication than older individuals, prob-
ably because of their small size (Heeley 1911). Paris (1963)
found heavy mortality among young in the terrestrial species Ar¬
madillidium vulgare as a result of desication. Verhoeff (1920)
suggests that the female is able to regulate the microclimate of
the brood pouch to protect the developing embryos from desica¬
tion. I now report on work indicating that the female has be -
havioral and physiological adaptations which combat environmental
stress to provide for the development of her brood.
The terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber is abundant within
the Monterey Peninsula. I looked for evidence of any difference
in natural distribution among three classes of P. scaber: brood-
ing females, males, and non-brooding females. Three general types
of habitat were sampled: (1) a predominately shaded area, cool and
moist, where isopods were found in the surface duff and under rot¬
