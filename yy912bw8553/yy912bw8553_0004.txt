Behavioral and Thysiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
16 - 19' C than at mean temperature from 12'- 15 C (p«.001, stud¬
ent's t-test) (Fig. 1). There was a higher percentage of females
at maximum temperature from 21 - 30 C than at maximum temperature
from 11 - 17 C (p£.010, student's t-test) (Fig. 2). There was a
higher number of females at minimum temperature 13 C than at min¬
imum temperature 11 C (p2.005, student's t-test) (Fig. 3).
To test the hypothesis that female P. scaber seek a different
temperature than male, Lbuilt a temperature gradient apparatus in
which the temperature response of animals of each class could be
tested in individual runways. Its heavy iron base produced a
smooth gradient ranging from 11' C to 30'C over a distance of 65
centimeterd. A strip of wet filter paper was laid down each run¬
way to provide 100 percent humidity. The temperature was measured
at two centimeter intervals along the gradient with a TELE-THERMO-
METER probe. Measuring the temperature across the gradient showed
less than O.5 C variation between different runways. The tempera-
ture gradient changed little during a series of five experiments.
In each experiment the animals were alternated by class. Since
P. scaber are photonegative, the apparatus was covered to elimi¬
nate light induced activity. After 10 minutes the cover was re-
moved and the positions of the isopods were recorded.
The mean temperatures sought by brooding females, non-brooding
females, and males were 20'C, 18°C, and 15.1 C respectively. An
analysis of variance determined that the variation of means was due
to difference in sex, and not to replication of residual errer
