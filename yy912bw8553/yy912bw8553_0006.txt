Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
rate of development was the average of the individual rates at each
temperature. The mean rate at 20°C was .16 stages per day, twice
as great as the mean rate at 15°C which was .23 stages per day, a
significant difference (p.0l, student's t-test).
Verhoeff (1920) reported durations of 19, 72, and 102 days in
P. scaber, from the time of the first visible swelling of the brood
pouch until the young emerged. He found that the variation in
brooding duration in P. scaber may br greater than in other species
of Oniscoidea. He also noted that the duration of individual stages
was dependant on the weather, however, he did not report temperature
data. At the stage which I called "l", the brood pouch was easily
perceptible. Even allowing for the elapse of several days before
"I", and for the possibility that my manipulations may have initi-
ated early emergence of the young, my brood durations - about 25 to
28 days at 20'C - were shorter than Verhoeff's shortest. The in¬
creased rate of development associated with a warmer microhabitat
is a likely factor in the temperature response shown by female P.
scaber at this time of year. As an advantage, the shorter brooding
duration decreases the length of a period during which the female is
most vulnerable to mechanical injury and parasitism, both noted by
verhoeff (1920). I observed several cases of damaged brood plates
as well as the presence of worms within some brood pouches.
Presumably there is increased desication stress associated with
a warmer microhabitat. That the female seeks warmer temperatures
may indicate that the brood poch envirorment provides a controlled
