Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
Summary
Field studies have revealed that female P. scaber seek warmer
temperatures than male. A laboratory experiment which allowed ani-
mals to seek temperatures in a gradient confirmed the field obser¬
vations, yielding mean temperatures of 15.lC and from 18 to 20'C
sought by males and females respectively. The experiment indicated
no difference between the temperature responses of brooding and
non-brooding females; the response does not seem to occur in the
individual with the onset of the brooding period, but appears to
be a characteristic of the sex. The positive response to warmer
temperatures which has been shown by females may be a seasonal oc¬
curance which insures that brooding females will experience temp¬
eratures which may be optimum for embryonic development. It has
been shown that increasing the temperature of the microhabitat from
15 to 20 C did indeed double the rate of embryonic development.
Rate of development clearly may play an important role in the temp¬
erature response. In conjunction with seeking a warmer habitat,
there is some evidence that females are able to withstand the effects
of desication stress for a longer period than males. That the brood
within the marsupium survives a period of desication which has killed
the mother provides striking evidence of the protective qualities of
the brood pouch.
