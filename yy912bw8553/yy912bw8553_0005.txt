Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P. scaber
(pé.Ol, F-test). There are significant differences between the
mean temperatures sought by males and brooding females (p.001,
student's t-test) and by males and females (pé.Ol, student's
t-test). There is no significant difference between the mean
temperatures sought by brooding and non-brooding females.
This confirms what the field study revealed: that female
P. scaber seek a higher temperature range than male. This may
be a seasonal occurance to insure that brooding females will ex¬
perience temperatures which may be optimal to development of the
embryos.
To investigate the role of temperature in the rate of devel-
opment of the young, I followed the in vivo development of eight-
een broods. I chose and characterized seven stages of develop¬
ment which I could easily identify, counting emergence as stage
"7", and selected eighteen females whose broods ranged through the
first six stages. These brooding females were kept in containers of
moist soil and vegetation, nine at 15°C and nine at 20°C. Every
other day a few embryos were removed from each brood and staged.
This technique required restraining the mother under filtered sea
water in a tray and lifting a brood plate to allow a few embryos to
float out. This method usually did not damage the brood pouch and
the females recovered immediately.
The average rate of development for each brood was calculated
as the number of stages through which it developed, divided by the
number of days it took to reach the last observed stage. The mean
