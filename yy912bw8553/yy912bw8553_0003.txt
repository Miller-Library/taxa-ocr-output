ting logs and boards; (2) under rocks of surface contact area
ranging fromm 200 to 800 square centimeters, resting on fine,
silty soil. These rocks were shaded about half the day, and
underneath them the relative humidity ranged from 60 to 80
percent. (3) Isopods were found on moist, decaying humus un¬
der iceplant on slopes exposed to the sun.
The surface temperatures under a roek, board or litter were
measured by slipping a glass-bulb mercury thermometer underneath
and checking the temperature in more than one place. The temper¬
ature varied little with the position of the thermometer. Rela-
tive humidity was measured by slipping cobalt chloride papers un¬
der the rock (Bedford 1955). Following these measurements all
isopods were collected, counted, sexed, and measured. Each rock
or board was treated as a separate sample. In areas where there
were no rocks or boards to deliniate a sample, a 50X50 or 30X30
square centimeter quadrat was used, to insure a sample size of at
least ten animals. Maximum-minimum thermometers were placed at
the sample sites for a period of six to ten days, both cool and
warm, from May 10 to May 25. The mean temperature was calculated
as the average of the maximum and minimum temperatures for all the
days.
The data from these field samples indicated temperature de-
pendant distribution. Since some sample sizes were small brood¬
ing and non-brooding females were grouped. Female P. scaber were
found in significantly greater numbers at mean temperature from
