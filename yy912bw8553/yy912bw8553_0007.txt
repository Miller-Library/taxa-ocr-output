Behavioral and Physiological Adaptations of Female P.scaber
humidity to protect the young. To test the effects of desication
stress on females and their broods, in comparison with males, the
animals were placed in a constant environment of 50 percent humidity
at 23 -25 C. Initially I used fourteen animals from each class and
recorded the time of death for each. Afterward I found that differ-
ences in weight as small as two milligrams could be masking any ef-
fect of the animals sex on its survival time. I selected only the
seven pairs in which the weight difference was less than one milli-
gram. The mean survival time for the group of three brooding and
four non-brooding females was 15.2 hours, siggnificantly longer
than the mean survival time for the seven males, 11.1 hours (pé.Ol1,
student's t-test). There is evidently some sex-related character-
istic which makes it possible for females to resist desication
stress longer than males. I have noticed a general difference
between the shapes of each sex: males tend to be longer and narrow¬
er than females and brooding females of the same weight.
At the time of her death, the brood of each female was still
alive. This is additional evidence that the marsupium is a pro-
tective environment. It is interesting that the mother is sacri-
ficed while the brood is preserved, since the embryos desicate with-
in a few hours if they remain in stress conditions. It seems more
advantageous to the species that the mother sacrifice her brood and
take advantage of the fluid in the marsupium,if she could possibly
live to produce another brood. This may indicate that there is no
link between the internal fluid system of the mother and the brood
pouch fluid.
