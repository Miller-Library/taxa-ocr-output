juveniles (£3 mm) were on the underside of cobbles. As cobble-sized rocks are found in
all height zones, this micro-habitat was one of a few relevant to a determination of height-
specific distribution and settlement. Juveniles raised in the lab grew to 2 mm in
approximately 160 days (Moran 1997), so I assumed that snails under 2 mm were 5
months or less in age. I searched for juvenile T. funebralis less than 2 mm in maximum
diameter at two sites: the protected area at Hopkins Marine Station (hereafter H.M.S.)
described above, and a very protected area behind the Monterey Breakwater. The
Breakwater site has a more even slope, and many cobble-size rocks, whereas most rocks
at H.M.S. are large and fixed. I took two samples in each of the three height zones at each
site; for each, a thorough inspection of a group of 8-12 cobbles lying adjacent to each
other was made with a hand lens. Presence or absence of juvenile snails was noted. In
each sample where snails were found, several were returned to the lab for identification
under a microscope, using characteristics outlined by Moran (1997 and personal
communication).
RESULTS
A Vertical Size Gradient
Average snail size increased with decreasing intertidal height (Fig. 1), and the two
were significantly correlated (p +.001). In sum, 1902 snails from 39 quadrats were
included in the correlation analysis.
A Cochran’s test revealed a heterogeneity of variances (Test value =.254, Critical
value = 235), so data underwent a square root (x+1) transformation before further
analysis. There was a significant interaction between intertidal height zone and size class,
