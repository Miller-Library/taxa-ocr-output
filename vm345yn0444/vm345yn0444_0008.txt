snails of each size class (total n = 36) were subjected to three treatments: no stimulus, a
tweezer point stimulus, and a tube foot stimulus. These experiments were carried out on a
submerged horizontal glass surface in the lab. Underneath a glass pane, I placed a sheet of
waterproof paper marked with concentric circles of radii 2 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm. Radii
were also marked at 30Â° intervals. Snails were collected immediately prior to the
experiment to ensure that none had time to acclimate to laboratory conditions. I started
each replicate run by placing a snail in the center of the circles. After the snail had
reattached its foot to the substrate, oriented itself upright, and prepared to crawl, by
feeling the surface with its cephalic tentacles, the stimulus (if any) was delivered to a single
cephalic tentacle. The length of time taken for the snail to cross the 4 em circle was
measured. The initial direction that the snail was facing when the stimulus was delivered
was also noted. As the snail moved, I traced its path on a map of the circular "grid,
noting the angle between the direction the snail faced initially and the direction in which it
crossed the 4 cm circle. Each snail was given all three treatments consecutively, with no
stimulus given first, followed by tweezers and then the tube foot. Following a snail's final
run, the glass pane was cleaned to remove mucus and other traces, and the water in the
tub was replaced. Two-factor ANOVAs were used to test for differences in both
displacement time and the number of degrees between the initial direction and final
location of a snail at 4 cm displacement. Stimulus type and size class were fixed factors.
Distribution of juveniles
To define the vertical distribution of recently-settled T. funebralis, I conducted a
field search for juveniles. In Oregon, Moran (1997) found that most newly settled
