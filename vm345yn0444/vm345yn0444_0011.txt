Behavioral Responses to Physical Stimuli
Times for each snail to move 4 cm from the center point were compared across
size classes and stimulus types (Fig. 6). Displacement times were shorter for all size
classes when the stimulus was a tube foot, compared to the treatment without a stimulus.
Displacement times in response to a tube foot were also lower than those in response to
the tweezer-point stimulus. Larger snails were, on average, faster than small snails, for
each treatment. Both stimulus type and size class had a significant effect on displacement
time, but there was not a significant interaction between the two (Table 6). Although
times decrease across stimuli, the relationship between size classes remains roughly the
same (Fig. 6); thus, stimuli and size class effects seem to operate independently. Within
terms were pooled with Interaction terms, and planned comparisons were made. Average
displacement times of small snails were significantly greater than both large and medium
snails.
The second behavioral measure was absolute degrees difference between initial
direction of the snail and the final direction at 4 cm displacement, again compared across
size classes and stimulus types (Fig. 7). The interaction between size class and stimulus
type was significant (Table 6). The relationship between size classes changes with
stimulus type. Mean degrees difference increased for both medium and large snails, from
the no-stimulus treatments to the tube foot treatments. In contrast, mean degrees
difference was less for the small snails when stimulated by tube feet, compared with the
difference when no stimulus was given. Planned comparisons showed that within the
group of behavioral responses to a tube foot, small snails displaced themselves
significantly fewer degrees, in comparison with medium snails. Other comparisons
