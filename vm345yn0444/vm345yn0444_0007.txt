classes in each tank by replacing snails that had been preyed upon. These replacements
came directly from the field, when collection was possible; when replacing snails during
high tides, I used Tegula that had been kept in an aquarium for one or two days. Each
replicate experiment continued for five days.
Because the natural reaction of T. funebralis to Pisaster is to climb vertical
surfaces to heights above the water line, barriers to prevent this behavior from leading to
escape were necessary. Lengths of thin galvanized steel edging, that had a right angle
with one inch sides, were cut and placed along the edges of the tanks, about an inch above
the water line. I then placed 1.5 inch strips of galvanized mesh over the top of the edging
Although snails could crawl an inch or less out of the water, they were forced to stop, or
crawl upside-down on the underside of the edging, where the Pisaster could reach. I
observed several snails moving up, away from the tank wall under the edging, and then
falling to the bottom after reaching the edge; when snails were found that could not right
themselves after falling, they were turned over with a clear length of plastic.
In addition to the susceptibility experiments with three sizes classes, I conducted
three more replicates using only 120 small snails. After five days, all snails were removed
and counted. Single-factor fixed effects ANOVAs were used to determine differences in
the susceptibility of the three size classes, based on the different proportions of each class
that was preyed upon.
Behavioral Responses to Physical Stimuli
To ascertain if differential susceptibility is the result of behavioral differences
among the size classes, I conducted the following experiments. In the laboratory, twelve
