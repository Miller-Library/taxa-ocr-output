Figure 1. Plot of mean snail size in each quadrat vs Intertidal height, fit with a
correlation line. Standard error (+-SE) bars.
Figure 2. Graph of relative proportions of size classes in each intertidal height zone.
Figure 3. Graph of abundances of each size class in each intertidal height zone.
Figure 4. Relative susceptibility: mean proportions of each size class eaten in
susceptibility experiments, (+/- SE).
Figure 5. Proportions of small size class eaten, with and without other sizes present in
experimental tanks (+/- SE).
Figure 6. Mean displacement times for each size class at the three stimuli (+/- SE).
Figure 7. Mean degrees difference for each size class at the three stimuli (+/- SE).
Figure 8. Representative snail paths. Shown are three snails, one in each size class. For
each snail, no stimulus treatment and tube foot treatment are shown. Note times
of displacement, snail paths, and initial direction marked as e
