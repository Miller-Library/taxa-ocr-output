desiccated faster than large snails in laboratory conditions. If large snails, in addition to
being more mobile, can better withstand the higher desiccation rates of the high intertidal,
one might expect to see a slight increase in mean size within a quadrat in the uppermost
limits of Tegula habitat, despite the fact that food availability would tend to drive the
majority of large snails down in intertidal height.
The predation experiments show clearly that small snails (Â£9 mm) are in much less
danger of being preyed upon by Pisaster, in comparison with other size classes. If the
decreased susceptibility of small snails in tanks with all three size classes was due simply
and only to a preference of Pisaster for larger snails, then one would expect to see an
increase in the proportion of small snails eaten, in tanks with only the small class.
However, proportions and numbers of small snails eaten increased very little in tanks with
only small snails. Together, these two sets of experiments indicate that the lower
susceptibility of small snails may be due to an inability of seastars to detect, capture, or
handle small snails.
The next set of experiments were intended to examine at the nature of the
differential susceptibility that was observed. Because large snails displaced themselves
away from a tube foot stimulus faster than smaller snails, and because smaller snails did
not seem to turn farther away from their initial direction when touched with a tube foot,
small snails would in fact seem to be more susceptible to predation. Combined with the
results of the predation experiments, this suggests that the decreased susceptibility is not
due solely or perhaps much at all to predator choices based on preference. I conclude that
some sort of physical limitation prevents small Tegula from being preyed upon. Perhaps
