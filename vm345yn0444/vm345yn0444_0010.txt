for T. funebralis abundances (Table 2). Small snails were the most prevalent size class in
the High zone. In the Mid zone, medium snails were the most abundant, and Large snails
dominated the Low zone (Fig. 2) While large and medium T. funebralis snails were
found in all zones, small snails were significantly lower in number than large snails, in the
Low zone (Fig. 3, Table 2). In this zone, many small and juvenile Tegula brunnea were
collected. Large snails increased in abundance with decreasing intertidal height, while
small and medium snails reached peak numbers in the Mid zone. There were significantly
more small and medium snails in the Mid zone, compared to the Low zone. Overall, there
were twice as many snails in the Mid zone than either of the other height zones (Table 1).
Additional post-hoc comparisons showed there was also a significantly higher average
total number of snails in each quadrat in the Mid zone, when compared with both the High
and Low zones (Table 2).
Predation by Pisaster
The seastars ate significantly more large snails than medium snails, and more
medium snails than small, despite the 1:2:3 ratio in favor of the small size class. In
addition, proportions eaten (Fig. 4) were significantly different (Table 5). While roughly
4% of the small snails were taken, over one quarter of the medium snails and over one half
of the large snails were taken (Table 4). Variances were not heterogenous (Cochran's
Test).
In experimental tanks with only small snails, an average of 8% were consumed
over 5 days (Fig. 5).
