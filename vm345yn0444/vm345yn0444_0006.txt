quadrat) were compared by a two-factor ANOVA with size class and height zone as
orthogonal fixed factors. Prior to analysis I tested for heterogeneity of variances, using
Cochran's test.
Susceptibility to Predation by Pisaster
In five outdoor tanks, measuring 49 cm x 52 cm x 32 cm deep, I conducted
replicate susceptibility experiments. In each tank, I placed two Pisaster ochraceus, a
known predator of Tegula spp. Three non-contiguous size classes of snails were used:
small (S9 mm), medium (12 - 14 mm), and large Q 17 mm).
Ratios of the numbers of snails in the three size classes were chosen with the goal
of equalizing the number of random encounters between a seastar and snails of a size
class. A simple 1:1:1 ratio of snails in each class would lead to relatively more seastar
encounters with large snails, as small snails on an individual basis are less likely to be
encountered. On the other extreme, equalizing the substrate area covered by snails in each
size class (a 1:2:5 ratio, between Large, Medium, and Small snails, respectively) would
lead to relatively more encounters with small snails, assuming they were not completely
clustered. Consequently, an intermediate ratio of 1:2:3 was used.
Sea stars were collected from the field and placed in holding tanks. I did not begin
a given trial until seastars began to feed on Tegula, to ensure that all were capable of
capturing and digesting prey. Aster one to three days, all of the seastars had successfully
preyed on a few snails. The preliminary snails were removed, and 120 recently-collected
snails were placed in each tank (20 Large, 40 Medium, and 60 Small). At least once a
day, empty shells were collected and measured. I maintained a constant ratio of size
