resources to maintain a selective advantage to downward migration. In the absence of
Pisaster, Paine felt that there would no longer be a strong advantage to migrating
downward, due to increased intraspecific competition. Consequently, any size gradient
would be less marked, or non-existent.
Fawcett (1984) concluded that a size gradient with mean shell size increasing over
decreasing intertidal heights would actually be observed in an areas with very little or no
predation, including that of crabs and octopus. This model for size gradients operated
under the assumption that T. funebralis settled as larvae in the mid-zone, the direction of
migration of large snails would then determine the size gradient. Large snails, as they are
more mobile, would either move down to take advantage of more abundant food
resources or, in the case of intense predation, up beyond smaller snails. In areas with high
predation, size gradients in which mean shell size increased in the upward direction were
observed at several sites, while the opposite gradient was observed in areas with low
predation intensities.
Despite the prevalence of theories for as a mechanism for establishing and
maintaining a size gradient, data on Tegula's size-specific susceptibility to predation is
lacking. Differences in susceptibility to predation, among snail sizes, when combined with
intertidal height-specific predation, might possibly be an important component of a size
gradient. In the present report, I present evidence for a size gradient at Hopkins Marine
Station at Monterey Bay, CA, and for size-related differential susceptibility to predation
by Pisaster. Evidence is presented for the nature of this size-related difference, gathered
in short-term behavioral experiments. Because results pointed to the importance of the
specific nature of settlement, and because the predation-based size gradient models depend
