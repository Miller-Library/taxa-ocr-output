INTRODUCTION
Tegula funebralis, the black turban snail, is a common herbivorous intertidal
gastropod that reaches a maximum size of approximately 22 to 24 mm in the Monterey
Bay area. Its predators include Cancer crabs, octopus, and most notably, the seastar
Pisaster ochraceus. It is one of several intertidal invertebrate species that exhibit shore-
level size gradients (Doering et al. 1983), with mean size increasing or decreasing in a
vertical direction along the intertidal zone, at a given geographic site.
There are several biotic and abiotic factors which may create and maintain shore-
level size gradients in T. funebralis. One such factor is environmental stress, including
temperature extremes, desiccation (Marchetti and Geller 1987), and wave action. Another
is habitat choice, on both the scale of microclimates and across the intertidal zone. Food
availability and differential preferences could also contribute to a size gradient. Other
factors include responses to light and gravity (Doering et al. 1983), settlement (Fawcett
1979), and potentially competition.
The most well-studied factor that may affect Tegula size gradients is predation.
Paine (1969) concluded that a size gradient in which mean shell size increases in a down-
shore direction is caused by the presence of Pisaster ochraceus in the low zone. From
observations made in Washington, Paine claimed that juvenile T. funebralis settled high in
the intertidal. In this scheme, with increasing size over their life span, T. funebralis would
migrate down into the low zone to take advantage of the greater food resources found in
the form of macroalgae. Although 25-28% of adult snails would be eaten each year by
Pisaster in areas of overlap, those that survived there would grow faster. Pisaster would
maintain levels of predation in this zone that would continue to leave enough available
