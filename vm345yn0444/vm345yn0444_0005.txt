implicitly on the location of juvenile settlement, I also made qualitative observations of
juvenile distributions; these findings are also presented here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vertical Size Gradient
Over 28 days, 10 transects 10 m in length were selected by placing a measuring
tape parallel to the water line (horizontal across the shore) in an area within the protected
rocky habitat at Hopkins Marine Station, Monterey Bay, CA (36°36' N 121°54' W). I
collected T. funebralis from transects during low tides, and ascertained quadrat heights
relative to the predicted low-tide sea level with a surveyor's level and a stadia rod. I
randomly selected five quadrats 25 cm in size within each transect. Each random distance
along a 10 m length of measuring tape was the center of a quadrat. Surface characteristics
and habitat type of each quadrat were also noted. I collected all Tegula spp. easily visible
to the unaided eye, and measured their sizes (maximum basal diameter) in the lab.
I partitioned the snails into groups based on the following intertidal height zones
(Ricketts et al 1985): a High Zone (between 5 and 2.5 ft, or 1.52-.76 m, above MLLW),
a Mid Zone (between 2.5 and 0 ft, or .76-0 m, above MLLW), and a Low Zone (between
0 and 1.8 ft, or 0-.55 m, below MLLW). Snails were also grouped into size classes: small
Tegula (S9 mm), medium (9 - 15 mm), and large ( 15 mm). Because most snails
collected were between 3 and 21 mm, arbitrary size classes spanning roughly 6 mm were
appropriate.
Mean snail sizes in each quadrat with 6 or more snails were tested for correlation
with quadrat height (as per Fawcett 1984). Abundances of T. funebralis (per 25 cm'
