Abstract: Past studies have found that the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis, exhibits
a shore-level size gradient, with mean shell size either increasing or decreasing in a down-
shore direction, at different sites. Predation has been implicated as a driving factor. A
shore-level size gradient was found at Monterey Bay, CA. Snails » 15 mm were more
abundant than other size classes in the Low intertidal zone, while snails 9 -15 mm were
the most abundant class in the Mid zone, and snails £9 mm were the most abundant class
in the High zone. Mean size increased in a down-shore direction. The study site had
virtually no Pisaster ochraceus, a known predator.
Laboratory experiments revealed that small snails are significantly less susceptible
to predation by Pisaster, compared with both medium and large snails. Experimental
responses to direct contact with tube feet show some size-related differences in short-term
behavior. However, these would tend to make small snails more susceptible than larger T.
funebralis; mechanisms other than defensive behavior must keep Pisaster from preying on
small snails.
A qualitative search for juvenile T. funebralis « 2 mm was undertaken at two sites
in Monterey Bay. Juveniles were abundant in the Mid zone at both sites, and rare or not
present in the High and Low zone, indicating that settlement occurs in the Mid zone, with
migration of T. funebralis becoming possible at greater sizes.
Results suggest that other factors besides predation, such as settlement, are
responsible for some components of a size gradient at a protected rocky shore in south
Monterey Bay, including the general absence of small T. funebralis from the Low
intertidal zone.
