does not seem to occur between adults of the species at this intertidal height (the transition
from adult T. funebralis to adult T. brunnea occurs in the high subtidal). These other
possible causative factors involving the Tegula funebralis size gradient invite and await
future research.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank my advisor, Jim Watanabe, for helping me in all stages of this
research, from conception to completion, and for his generosity in giving time and sharing
knowledge. I would also like to thank Isaac Kaplan, Natalie Lu, Sarah Girshick, and
Tamara Jaron for making life in our house a ridiculously enjoyable experience. Thanks
also to Amy Moran for providing helpful information on the location and identification of
juveniles.
