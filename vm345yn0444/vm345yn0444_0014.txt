Pisaster are less able to recognize small T. funebralis as prey, or perhaps they are too hard
to handle.
That small snails are in much less danger from predation by Pisaster suggests that
a factor different than predation is responsible for their general absence from the Low
zone of the intertidal. Settlement seems to be an obvious choice: Fawcett (1979) found
that larvae settle mainly in the Mid intertidal region. The results of my search for juveniles
under 2 mm, which are likely to be only about 150 days old (Moran 1997), support this.
Because snails this small are virtually immobile relative to the whole intertidal zone, the
height at which they are found is likely to be the height at which settlement occurred. It is
unknown whether larvae actually settle in only the Mid zone, or whether they settle
indiscriminately but suffer from high mortality in other height zones
High mortality in other height zones, following indiscriminate settlement, would
likely also be due to factors other than predation. Jensen (1981) found juvenile T.
funebralis under 4 mm primarily in sandy holdfasts and on the undersides of rocks in
pools, at H.M.S. If these microhabitats are the most favorable for small snails, and they
are found primarily in the Mid zone, then microhabitat may play a role. In addition, Jensen
found that 70% of the stomach contents (and hence of diet) of juvenile T. funebralis under
4 mm was detritus. How this apparently non-selective feeding behavior might influence
distribution has not been determined.
Interspecific competition may affect size classes differently, as well. Almost no
small T. funebralis were found in the low zone, where juvenile T. brunnea were abundant
in this zone. This zonation is quite clear, suggesting that T. brunnea may competitively
displace juvenile T. funebralis in the low zone, although such an interspecific interaction
