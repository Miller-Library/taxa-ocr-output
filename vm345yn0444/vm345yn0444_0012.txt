Intertidal Distribution of Juvenile T. funebralis
At H.M.S., I found no juveniles under 2 mm in the High zone. While juveniles
were abundant in the Mid zone, I found only a small number in the Low zone. At the
Monterey Breakwater site, I was able to find a small number of juvenile funebralis in the
High zone. Juveniles again were abundant in the Mid zone. I failed to find any in the Low
zone. See Table 3.
DISCUSSION
The results of extensive intertidal sampling indicate the presence of a size gradient
in the protected rocky habitat at H.M.S.: both mean size and relative abundances of
different size classes change significantly among intertidal zones. Because snails increased
in mean size in a down-shore direction and Pisaster seemed to be almost completely
absent from this site, my findings are consistent with Fawcett's (1984) explanation of how
predation (or its absence) can maintain a size gradient.
Although the correlation of mean size with intertidal height explained only 11% of
the variation in snail sizes, the slope was significantly negative. However, a U-shaped
curve might better fit these data, as many of the average sizes in the highest quadrats
increased over those in high mid-zone quadrats (Fig. 1). This possibility is intriguing,
especially when considered in the context of the possible size-gradient factor of
environmental stress. Marchetti and Geller (1987) demonstrated that small T. funebralis
