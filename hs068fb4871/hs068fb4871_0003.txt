found to vary markedly in closely associated areas. In hermit
crab shells large enough to contain C. perforans the infestation
usse
was quite high on one side of  Point of Hopkins Marine
Station, as it also was at nearby Point Pinos. On the other
side of  Point the number of infected crabs was much
lower. (See figure + 2.)
The size of the host shell has great bearing on the pre-
sence of C. perforans. No molluscs were found in Tegula fun-
ebralis shells less than O.25 inches in greatest diameter.
Other types of shells, such as Thais emarginata, were considered
to be C. perforans-bearing size if they did not pass through
0.25 inch screening in the sizing process of the Pagurus sur-
vey/ (See Belknap and Markham, 1965.) Of 120 crabs smaller
than the minimum size, only one, a Calliostoma shell, had a
Crepidula perforans on the outside. In crabs with shells great-
er than 0.25 inches in diameter infestation was quite high.
(See figure + 3.)
Crepidula perforans is not exclusively found in Tegula
funebralis shells. The 350 crabs of C. perforans-bearing size
inhabited 284 T. funebralis shells and 66 non-T. funebralis
shells (including 23 Tegula brunea shells.) Of the latter,
22 or 33% contained C. perforans. No C. perforans were found
in unoccupied shells or in rocks in the course of this study.
Infestation by C. perforans of different species of Pag-
urus was also quite variable. 68% of Pagurus hemphilii (n-33)
