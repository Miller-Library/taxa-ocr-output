tachk to the side rather than the bottom of the shell may
facilitate feeding by causing water to flow from the top of
the shell to the bottom. (See figure + 7.) This position in
the shell might also be enforced by the hermit crab. Further
investigation of the currents of the C. perforans as they in-
teract with the currents of the hermit crab may clarify the
commensal relation of the two.
DISPERSAL
The uneven distribution of Crepidula perforans in the in-
tertidal may be due in part to complex physical factors which
were not investigated during this study. Instead this study
concentrated on biological aspects of the mollusc which may
account for the observation that two nearby areas may have wide
differences in C. perforans population. The behavior of the
young and the attraction behavior of C. perforans to hermit
crabs were examined to gain knowledge about the dispersal of
the molluscs.
In Crepidula adunca the young do not undergo a pelagic
stage. Upon hatching they are unable to attach to the shell
and are pushed off by the mother. Presumably the young live
somewhere in the intertidal until they are strong enough to
hold onto the shell/ (Putnam, 1964/), In Crepidula perforans,
which also does not have a pelagic stage, the behavior is some-
what different. To study the behavior of the young the mother
