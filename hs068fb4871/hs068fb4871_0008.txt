. C. perforans did not seem to be attracted at all
to uninhabited Tegula funebralis shells. In no case were they
observed attached to uninhabited shells.
In addition to thetattraction of C. perforans to Pagurus
interactions among hermit crabs were investigated as possible
means of dispersal of C. perforans. A tank was set up contain-
ing ten unmarked hermit crabs with C. perforans and ten marked
Pagurus without them. Appearance of C. perforans in the
marked shell was looked for. Transfer of C. perforans
from a hermit crab bearing them to another hermit crab not hav-
ing them occurred once during a three week period. The means
of transfer is not known. However, the hermit crab might be
effective in dispersing the molluscs by carrying them on its
body when changing shells, by close contact occurring when
Pagurus are mating, or by close contact occurring when inact-
ive crabs are clustered together.
SUMMARY
Crepidula perforans (Valencienes, 1846), a gastropod liv-
ing inside hermit crab shells, is unevenly distributed in the area
of China Point at Hopkins Marine Station. The mollusc is not
