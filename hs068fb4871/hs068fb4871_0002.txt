The marine gastropod Crepidula perforans (Valenciennes,
1846) lives inside Tegula funebralis shells inhabited by her-
mit crabs (Pagurus species.) (See figure + 1.) It has also
been reported as living in rocks by Smith and Gordon (1948)
and by Coe (1949). While Crepidula adunca Sowerby, a commen-
sal which lives on the outside of Tegula funebralis shells,
has been the subject of many studies (Coe, 1949; Moritz,
1938, 1939; Putnam, 1964; etc.,) little has been published a-
bout C. perforans. The present study was undertaken at the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove,
California, in April and May, 1965, to determine the distri-
bution of the mollusc and to investigate some aspects of the
relationship between the mollusc and the crustacean.
DISTRIBUTION AND NUMBERS
The survey of the Crepidula perforans population was done
in conjunction with a study of the Pagurus population of Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California by Robert Belknap and John
Markham. Thirteen samples were collected from the profiles
(see figure + 2) surveyed by Belknap and Markham (see Belknap
and Markham, 1965.) Each hermit crab shell was measured and
examined for presence of Crepidula perforans. The sex and spe-
cies of the crab, size and number of Crepidula, type of shell,
and position of C. perforans on the shell were also noted.
