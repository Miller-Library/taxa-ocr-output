was removed from the shell exposing the egg capsule which was
torn open to hatch the young. The young were immediately able
to attach to the shell and remain on it. (See figure + 8.)
Their clinging ability may explain the uneven distribution of
the mollusc. If the young are able to stay in the shell, dis-
persal will not be effected in the same manner as in C. adunca.
(See above.) Perhaps the C. perforans rarely leave the shell
they were born in or do so at a more advanced age than C. adunea.
Certainly the distribution of the mollusc indicates a dispersal
mechanism which is effective only over a small range. If in-
deed under natural situations the young are able to cling to
the shell some discrepancy is found in comparing the number of
eggs per mother and the number of C. perforans per shell. The
largest number of molluscs found on a single shell was 14, while
the average number of eggs per mother was 150. Somehow the
large excess must be gotten rid of, either by the crab or im
the mother.
The attraction of C. perforans to members of its own spe-
cies or to Pagurus is probably a very important factor in dis-
persal of the molluscs. Initial attempts to establish chemo-
taxis in C. perforans using glass dishes nine inches in diam-
eter with shells and/or hermit crabs placed at intervals along
the outer perimeter and C. perforans in the center were unsuc-
cessful due to the immobility of the mollusc. This very char-
