acteristic may account in part for the animal's uneven distri-
bution. Certainly the mollusc with its small foot and contoured
shell could not traverse great distances to lodge in a hermit
crab, so experiments were set up to see if attraction could
be established over small distances. First ten C. perforans
were placed on the bottom of a small (4inch by 4 inch) plastic
dish inwwhich was also placed a crab or an empty shell. Be-
coming attached to the crab or shell was considered evidence
of attraction. In three instances out of seven trials C. per-
forans were able to attach toethe outside of a hermit crab mov-
ing about in the dish. In these instances the method by which
the C. perforans became attached to the shell was not observed
so a new set of experiments was devised. Small C. perforans
were placed 5 mm from stationary Pagurus and were observed for
two hour periods for signs of attraction. In two instances
out of six the mollusc was able to lift itself onto the out-
side of the shell and crawl to the inside. Attraction of small
C. perforans males to large females was also examined for in-
sight into dispersal. In C. adunca the young males are attracted
primarily to females rather than shells. (See Putnam, 1964,).
It was thought that this might also be true for C. perforans.
To test this hypothesis small males were placed 5 mm from a
large female and were observed for two hours for evidence of
attraction. No marked attraction of young males toward large
females was observed. The attraction of the small C. perforans
