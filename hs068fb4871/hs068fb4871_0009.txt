found in shells less than 0.25 inches in diameter. It is most
often, though not always, found in Tegula funebralis shells.
The distribution of the mollusc in different species of Pagurus
is varied. The animal is situated in the outermost whorl of
the shell with its head fading the opening. The larger the
crab, the more C. perforans it is likely to have. The larger
the Crepidula inhabiting the shell, the fewer found in the
shell. The young molluscs are able to cling to the shell upon
hatching. C. perforans is attracted to Pagurus but not to mem-
bers of its own species or T. funebralis shells. The molluse
is able to move from one hermit crab to another.
