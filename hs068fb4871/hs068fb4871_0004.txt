-3-
and 45.4% of Pagurus samuelis (n-156) contained C. perforans
in contrast with Pagurus granosimanus (n-144) which had 17.5%
infection and Pagurus hirsutiusculus (n-17) which had 10.6%
infection (where n-total number of crabs examined.) The low
infestation of P. hirsutiusculus is due in large part to the
smaller size of the species at maturity.
Within the host shell, distribution of C. perforans depends
on several factors. The number of molluscs per shell depends
on crab size. The larger the crab, the more C. perforans it
is likely to possess. (See figure + 4.) The number of C. per-
forans in the shell depends also in large part on the size of
molluscs present in the shell. It is unusual to find two C.
perforans of egg-bearing size in a single shell, while a large
number of small ones are often found together or in association
with a large one. (See figure + 5.) The small number of large
molluscs may be due to mortality, to lack of room in the shell,
or toinhibiting factor produced by the large C. per-
forans. The mollusc is situated most often on the outside wall
of the bottom-most whorl of the Tegula shell near its opening.
(See figure + 6.) In 40 animals examined, the head of the mol-
lusc always pointed toward the opening. This position of the
mollusc in the shell may have a great deal to do with its fil-
ter-feeding mechanism. The current which it creates for feed-
ing goes from left to right
and at-
