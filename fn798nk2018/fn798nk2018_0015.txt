Plate 1: Optic lobe cells with relatively simple neurite processes.
a-c) show mono-polar cells d,e) give examples of bi-polar cells. All
cells are from cultures with standard media:
a: pH 7.4, 23 hrs after plating.
d: pH 7.4, 48 hrs.
b: pH 7.7, 9.25 hrs.
e: pH 8.0, 24.5 hrs.
C: pH 7.4, 54 hrs.
Plate 2: Optic lobe cells with extensively developed processes. a,b)
are examples of multi-polar cells. c-e) are cells that appear to make
connections with each other. All cells are from cultures with
standard media:
a: pH 7.7, 9.25 hrs. after plating.
C: pH 7.7, 9.25 hrs.
d: pH 7.4, 54 hrs.
b: pH 7.4, 54 hrs.
e: pH 7.7, 24 hrs.
Plate 3: Time-lapse pictures of cells developing processes. a,b)
shows several cells in standard media (pH 7.7) 0.5 hrs after plating
and 3.5 hrs after plating. c-e) Example of one cell developing, from
the same culture, 17.75, 18.75, and 19.75 hrs after plating
(respectively).
