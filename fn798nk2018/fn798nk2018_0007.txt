Effects of pH Squid blood was extracted from an adult animal and
found to have a pH of 7.7, cells were therefore plated and cultured at
this pH. It seems likely that pH would be a very important factor in
squid tissue cultures, because of the strong controll exerted by pH on
aerobic versus anaerobic metabolic pathways in molluscs (Prosser,
1973). The effects of relatively small pH changes around pH 7.7 on
neurons in culture can be seen in Figure 1.
At pH 7.7 neurites develop rapidly, and the percentage of cells
with processes peaks 2-4 hours after plating and starts to slowly
decrease after 24 hours. Cells cultured at pH 7.4 and 8.0 show a
similar time course for the rise and decline of development of
processes, but the maximim number of cells growing neurites can be
affected by small changes in pH. Although it appears that cultures at
PH 7.7 fared better than cultures at either pH 7.4 or 8.0, only the pH
8.0 data showed a statistically significant inhibition of neurite
development (see Table 1). In 3 cultures testing pH 7.7 versus 7.4, no
significant difference in the total percentage of cells developing
neurites was noted. Since pH 7.7 and 7.4 definitely were more
effective, all further experiments were carried out at these values.
Effects of bovine serum vs. squid blood In order to find out how
whole squid blood as an additive might compare with bovine serum,
the 6% bovine serum was omitted from the medium and 107 squid
