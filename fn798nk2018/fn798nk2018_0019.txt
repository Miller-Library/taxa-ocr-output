Acknowledgements
It is with great gratitude that I thank the entire Hopkins Marine
Station staff for making Bio. 175H such a success. In particular,
would like to thank Judy Thompson for holding the whole program
together; Chuck Baxter, Mark Denny, and Stuart Thompson for their
encouragement, interest, and advice. A very special thank you to
William Gilly for his persistence in challenging students' ideas,
preconceptions, limitations, and fishing skills, and to Patricia
Gosling for her seemingly unlimited patience and many hours of help.
