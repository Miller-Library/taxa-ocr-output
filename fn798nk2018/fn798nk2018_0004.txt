dishes allowed to air-dry for 30 minutes.
Cell culture plating. A drop of medium (see below) was placed on a
prepared coverslip in a 10 x 35mm plastic petri dish (Falcon). The
previously proteased neural tissue was then mechanically disrupted
with forceps in the drop of medium in order to release neurons for
culturing. Usually one optic lobe or two stellate ganglia were used
per dish. The resulting standard density was from 3-20 cells/0.03
mme. In one dish plated at a higher density the resulting density was
from 15-50 cells/O.03mm4. The cells were then allowed 15-20
minutes to settle after which time 2 ml of medium was added to
each dish. Cells plated in the collagen-coated dishes were allowed 40
minutes to settle. All cultures were maintained at 15.7°C in a
temperature control room. One dish was also kept at 17-21°C using
the standard medium (see below) with no notable difference in
development of processes.
Growth media. The standard L-15-based medium used for squid
neurons contained L-15 (Gibco) plus 6% Fetal Bovine Serun (Hyclone),
12.5 ug/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma), and added salts to final
concentrations of: 10 mM Caci», 10 mM KCI, 50 mM MgCI, and 434.2
mMNacl. Final osmolality was 980 mösm/Kg H9O. The pH was
