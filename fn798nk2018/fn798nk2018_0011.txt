addition, it may serve as incentive for a further density studies with
a much larger sample size.
Finally, it is possible that the stellate ganglion never developed
processes in culture because they are too far along in their
development at the later embryo stages. Therefore, it may be
interesting to use ganglion from earlier embryo stages although the
dissections may prove more difficult.
Further directions of study may include answers to such
questions as: does pH effect process length, branching, or number of
processes? Does the presence of an original process effect the
initiation of growth or restrict the number of processes? These are
some factors that have been shown to be influenced by the presence
of hemolymph in Aplysia neurons in cell culture (Schacher and
Proshansky,1983).
