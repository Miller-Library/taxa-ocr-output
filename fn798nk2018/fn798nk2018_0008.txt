blood was added instead. As can be seen from Figure 2, the medium
with whole blood (□) was no better than the L-15 based medium with
po serum added at all (A) and not nearly as effective as the standard
medium containing 6% bovine serum (• ). Thus, fetal bovine serum
stimulates neurite growth, whereas squid blood has no detectable
effect.
As a check on whether there might be something in squid blood
which actually hindered neurite growth, the whole blood was
centrifuged (see methods) which presumably removed most of the
hemocyanin which is present in the blood at 80 mg/ml (Prosser,
1973). Even this hemolymph without the hemocyanin (—) produced no
positive effect as a medium additive. Because the hemolymph and
whole blood produced very similar results, it seems that the absence
or presence of hemocyanin cannot be the sole factor responsible for
the results in Figure 2. Finally the addition of whole blood to the
standard medium containing 6% bovine serum (m) appears to reduce
the efficacy of the standard with bovine serum as an additive.
Effect of substrate. It has been shown that a collagen substrate
is necessary for cell differentiation in chick skeletal muscle cell
cultures (Work, and Burdon, 1980), and collagen is present in large
amounts in squid connective tissue and mantle (Gosline and Shadwick,
1983). Therefore, collagen was investigated as an alternative to
