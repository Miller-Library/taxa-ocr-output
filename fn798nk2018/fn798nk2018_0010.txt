effects. Finally, the presence of hemocyanin, the changing of the
medium at 5 and 21 hours, and the growing of cells at room
temperature do not seem to effect the cells in culture to any notable
degree.
The results from using collagen as a substrate rather than
poly-L-lysine may be incorrectly interpreted as saying that collagen
does not promote the development of processes. However, it seems
more likely that these results point to a problem in the method of
collagen preparation.
The development of neurites appears to be hindered by the
addition of squid blood to the medium with bovin serum. Here, it is
interesting to note that in the development of the squid embryo, the
nervous system develops from day 9 to about day 18 whereas the
hearts begin to beat at about 21-24 days (Fields, 1965). Perhaps the
earlier development of processes in the animal is inhibited by the
blood.
Although a brief examination of changing the medium was
carried out, further study should be completed to see if changing the
medium every 24 hours for several days might help maintain the
processes in culture for a longer period of time.
The results of the density study should be taken as an obsrvation of
the density which seems to be most beneficial to the cultures. In
