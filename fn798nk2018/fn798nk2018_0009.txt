poly-L-lysine. The preparation of squid collagen is described in the
methods section, mammalian collagen was not tried. Cultures plated
on the collagen grew processes very poorly compared to cultures
plated on poly-L-lysine (see Figure 3 and Table 1).
Effect of cell density. A density study was carried out because of
the possibility that cells might condition the medium or influence one
another through contact in a positive or negative manner. The results
suggest that the cells tend to develop more effectively in the
standard density of 3-20 cells/O.03mm4 rather than the higher
density (see Methods) of 15-50 cells/O.03mm√©. The more dense
culture plated with the standard medium, pH 7.4, reached a maximum
percentage of cells with processes of only 38 whereas cells plated
at the standard density in the same medium reached a maximum of
127 (pH 7.4, Figure 1).
Discussion
In summary, the pH of the cultures conclusively influences the
growth of processes from neural cells in culture, with pH's of 7.4 and
7.7 proving the most effective. Further, the use of bovine serum in
the dishes appears to be necessary for growth of processes and more
effective than whole squid blood or hemolymph. The addition of squid
blood to the culture with bovine serum seems to have negative
