Abstract
Cells isolated from optic lobe neural tissue from embryos of the
squid, Loligo opalesceng develop processes in culture. Growth of
neurites depends on pH of the culture medium, nature of the
substrate, and presence of medium additives (Fetal Bovine Serum,
squid blood, and hemolymph). The optimal conditions identified were
PH 7.7, poly-L-lysine substrate, and bovine serum. Both whole squid
blood and hemolymph depressed neurite outgrowth.
Introduction
In squid the giant axon controlling escape jetting is formed by
fusion of small axonal processes from hundreds of cell bodies in the
giant fiber lobe of the stellate ganglion (Young, 1939). Unlike the
giant axons to which they give rise, these cell bodies do not show any
sodium currents when studied with voltage clamp techiques in situ
or after enzymatic isolation. Sodium currents appear after several
days if the isolated cell bodies are grown in a cell culture and
appearance of Na channels depends on mRNA synthesis and
microtubules (Brismar and Gilly, 1987). However, very little is
known in regards to how these channels are targeted for transport
from the site of synthesis in the neuronal cell body to their final
destination in the giant axons. How such sorting occurs and what are
the regulatory factors in channel trafficking are important questions
