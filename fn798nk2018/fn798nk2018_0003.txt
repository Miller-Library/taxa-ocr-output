embryos (Fields, 1965) were pinned through the area immediately
posterior to the arms to Sylgard (DowCorning Corp) and the optic
lobes (including attached central nervous system tissue) and the
stellate ganglia were excised in filtered (0.22um) sea water using
sterile instruments and a Wild stereo microscope. The tissues were
then treated with non-specific protease in filtered sea water
(Img/ml, Sigma Type XIV), for 1 minute, and then washed in filtered
sea water for 3-5 minutes.
Cell culture coverslips and dishes. Coverslips used for culturing
were manually coated with 5 ul of 18 poly-L-lysine (Sigma, MWÂ»
300,000) solution made with distilled water. Coated coverslips
were air-dried for 10-30 minutes (under a dust hood), rinsed with
sterile, distilled water, and then air-dried a second time.
In addition to poly-L-lysine, collagen was also used as a
substrate. Adult squid collagen was obtained from the connective
tissue tunics covering the mantle as described by Gosline and
Shadwick (1983). Blotted tunics (approx. 0.13g total) were added to
10Oml of distilled water, adjusted to pH 2.9 with HCL, and autoclaved
in an effort to obtain collagen in solution. The autoclaved mixture
was then filtered and Iml of it was placed in each culture dish for
about 15 hours, after which time the solution was poured off and the
