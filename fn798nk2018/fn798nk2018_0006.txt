and 2. Cells typically had somata with a diameter of 5-8 um and
neurite processes of 3-25.5 um in length. In addition, some cells with
neurites appeared to make connections with other cells (plate 2).
Outgrowth of processes occured within hours after plating, and
changes in individual cells over time are shown in plate 3.
Stellate ganglion cells failed to develop processes in culture
during this study, even though both types of neural tissue were
treated identically and cultured in parallel throughout. The remainder
of this paper will describe results on optic lobe neurons in more
detail.
In general, the cells survived in culture without changing the
medium for up to 10 days. Ã„fter 10 days, many of the cells' interiors
looked darker and therefore the health of the cells was questionable.
One dish had the medium replaced after 5 and 21 hours, but this
revealed no significant influence on neurite development or cell
survival. Effects of medium changes later during culture were not
investigated. Fungi did develop in three dishes after about 5 days and
bacteria in two dishes after four days. Overall, chloramphenicol
seemed to be very effective in controlling contaminations, compared
to penicillin-streptomycin which was used in the earliest stages of
this work.
