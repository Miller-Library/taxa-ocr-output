Figure 1. pH influence on neurite outgrowth. The total percentage of
cells with processes during time in culture are plotted for 3 pH
values as indicated. All dishes use the standard media on
poly-L-lysine. The 7.7 and 7.4 curves represent 3 dishes each
whereas the 8.0 curve represents 2 dishes. The significance of the
apparent differences can be seen in Table 1. Cells at pH 7.7 and 7.4
did significantly better than at pH 8.0.
Figure 2. Comparison of fetal bovine serum with squid blood as a
medium additive. Percentages of cells with processes over time in
culture is indicated for the following additives
(1) () L-15 plus 6% serum (3 dishes).
(2) (m) L-15 plus 6% serum plus 10% whole squid blood (1 dish).
(3) (A) L-15 only (1 dish).
(4) (Â») L-15 plus 10% squid hemolymph (1 dish).
(5) ( L-15 plus 10% whole squid blood (1 dish).
All dishes are at pH 7.7, plated on poly-L-lysine. Although not
statistically analyzed, it can be seen from the graph that: there is an
inhibition of process growth if serum is omitted from the medium.
Replacing serum with 10% squid blood or 103 hemolymph drastically
hinders process development. The presence (as in whole blood) or
absence (as in hemolymph) of hemocyanin does not alter this result.
Addition of 10% squid blood to L-15 plus 6% serum may also inhibit
the development of processes, but the effect is not so clear cut.
Figure 3. Using collagen as a substrate rather than poly-L-lysine.
Both groups use the standard media at pH 7.4. Two cultures were
plated on collagen and three on poly-L-lysine. The collagen culture did
significantly worse than the poly-L-lysine cuture (see Table 1).
Table 1: Comparison of maximum 3 of cells with processes,
statistically analyzed with an unpaired t-test. pH's 7.7 and 7.4 both
had significantly higher max. % with processes than pH 8.0. Further,
the pH of 7.4 did significantly better on poly-L-lysine than collagen
and with bovine serum rather than hemolymph.
