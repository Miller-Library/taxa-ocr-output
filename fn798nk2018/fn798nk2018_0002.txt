to answer in trying to extend our knowledge of long-term nervous
system function. These questions and others, such as what directs
axonal growth towards the correct target, what mediates cell-cell
recognition and determines proper synapse formation may eventually
be answered through the study of these cells and their growing
processes in primary tissue culture.
Use of primary cultures of nervous tissue is a well developed
approach, even with invertebrate tissue. Thus far, however, nerve
cell culturing studies in the molluscs have focused on Aplysia
(Schacher and Proshansky, 1983; Kaczmarek et al., 1979), and no
comparably systematic work has appeared on techniques of squid
neuron culture. Because of the attractive model system presented by
the giant fiber lobe cell bodies and their giant axons for studying Na
channel trafficking, this study was undertaken to begin defining an
effective method for culturing neural tissue from squid, and to
identify some parameters that influence neurite outgrowth.
Materials and Methods
Animals and cell preparation. Egg capsules of Loligo opalescens
collected in Monterey Bay or from spawning in laboratory holding
tanks were kept in tanks with running sea water. 21-24 day old
