adjusted to the desired level between 7.4 and 8.0 with HCI and NaoH.
For the experiment using whole squid blood as a medium additive,
blood was extracted from the anterior aorta and cephalic vein of adult
Loligo opalescens. Hemolymph was prepared from whole blood by
centrifugation at 40,000 RPM (100,000g) for 16 hours at 57C. This
resulted in a visually obvious blue pellet (presumably of hemocyanin)
from which the hemolymph could be decanted. Blood and hemolymph
were stored frozen (-20Â°C).
Culture examination and cell counting Cultures were periodcally
examined with an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope (600X) using
phase contrast optics. The 35mm slide field defines a rectangle
(actual size of 210um X 140um with the 40X ob jective used) which
served as a convenient standard area for cell counting. 15-22
pseudo-randomly chosen fields were examined per dish and the total
number of living cells and the numbers of cells showing neurites
counted. Typically, 150-200 cells were counted per dish during each
examination.
Results
Neurons grown in the standard L-15 based medium on a
poly-L-lysine substrate readily grew processes in culture. Mono, bi,
and multi-polar cells from optic lobe cultures are shown in plates i
