swimming frequencies resulted from pauses between and within
cycles. Öften, an animal was observed to swim for a few cycles, to
pause at midline or to one side, and then resume swimming for a few
more cycles before pausing again. The resumption of swimming from
midline was observed to occur both in-phase (left, pause, right) and
out-of-phase (left, pause, left) without apparent pattern.
Behavioral Changes After 5-HT Application
5-HT application to the stabilized ganglia of a swimming
Melibe in the whole animal preparation resulted in an increase in
swimming frequency immediately upon application in 5 of 7 animals
(Figure 6). There was an average increase in swimming frequency of
181% upon 5-HT application. Swimming contractions were more
vigorous as defined by tight right and left bends of the body wall so
that the cerata touched the oral hood (Figure 1), after the application
of serotonin compared to those before 5-HT.
5-HT application to the stabilized ganglia of a Melibe standing
on substrate resulted in writhing-consisting of alternating left and
right contractions of the body wall reminiscent of swimming. When
the foot was dislodged from the substrate using a tactile stimulus,
vigorous swimming ensued. If only the posterior portion of the foot
were attached to substrate, the animal would writhe until it
dislodged itself from the substrate. Äfter successive 5-HT
applications to the same animal, no noticeable behavior changes were
seen, i.e. contractions were no longer produced while the animal was
standing on substrate, and swimming frequency was no longer
increased.
Applications of 10 ml sea water alone or 10 ml ASW + 0.1%
ascorbic acid (pH 7.5) to the stabilized head ganglia of a swimming
Melibe were also done to control for movement or vehicle artifact. In
