was kept at approximately 14° C by a cold plate.
Drug Application
The effect of serotonin (5-HT) was studied in whole animal
preparations and isolated ganglia preparations. In the whole animal
preparation, 10 ml of 10°2 M 5-HT was pipetted directly onto the
stabilized head ganglia of the animal. This concentration was chosen
so that some of the drug would reach the neuronal synapses in the
ganglia without eliciting non-specific responses. Solutions of 5-HT
creatinine sulfate were made in ASW + 0.1% ascorbic acid (pH 7.5).
Ascorbic acid was needed to preserve the stability of the drugs in
solution. Even with the addition of ascorbic acid, 5-HT solutions
were stable for only a few hours.
10 ml of 10-9 M 5-HT solution was applied directly to the
isolated ganglia preparation. Solutions of 5-HT were again made up in
ASW + 0.1% ascorbic acid (pH 7.5). Drug application was followed
immediately by a 10 ml washout with ASW.
Extracellular Recordings
Recordings were made directly over Interneuron 1, which is
located in the pleural ganglia (Figure 2). Recordings from Interneuron
1 were only done in the isolated ganglia preparation. Interneuron 1
was located by its topographical location in the pleural ganglia and by
its burst firing pattern (Thompson, unpublished data; Wesseling,
personal communication). The isolated ganglia preparation was
chosen for recording because of its convenience and because isolation
of the ganglia has been shown to have no effect on the burst firing
pattern of Interneuron 1 (Thompson, unpublished data).
Extracellular suction electrode recording allowed quick and
easy location of Interneuron 1 by monitoring its firing pattern.
