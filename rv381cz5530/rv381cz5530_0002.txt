INTRODUCTION
The concept of a central pattern generator, or CPG, has played a
key role in the understanding of how rhythmic motor patterns are
generated. It is theorized that discrete neural circuits present in the
central nervous system, operating in the absence of proprioceptive
feedback, control the stereotypical motor patterns seen in many
behaviors (Harris-Warrick et al., 1989). Studies of systems like that
of the crustacean digestive system and stomatogastric ganglion have
provided insight into, not only the control of a rhythmic motor pattern
by a CPG, but also the modulation of a CPG by neuroactive substances
like serotonin and dopamine, and the peptide hormones proctolin and
red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH) (Harris-Warrick et al.,
1989). For the studies of chemical modulation of rhythmic behavior,
alternative systems can give new insight into understanding CPG
control. One such system consists of the swimming motor pattern of
Melibe leonina.
Melibe swimming behavior has been characterized by Stuart
Thompson (unpublished observations) and by Anne Herst (1968). The
swimming motor pattern consists of alternating contractions of the
body wall when the foot is dislodged from its substrate. These
alternating contractions cause the animal to bend from side to side
(Figure 1). Although Melibe exhibit several other behaviors including
feeding, crumple, and shrug responses (Diane Scott, personal
communication), it is the swimming behavior which has been a
primary focus of previous studies.
The neural circuit, or CPG, underlying the control of swimming
was studied and modeled by Thompson (personal communication). His
model centers on two pairs of interneurons. One cell of each pair,
Interneuron 1, is located on the dorsal surface of the pleural ganglia,
