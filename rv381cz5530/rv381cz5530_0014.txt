Figure 1. Dorsal view of vigorous swimming in Melibe.
Figure 2. Melibe head ganglia (dorsal view). Interneuron 1,
Interneuron 2, and specific ganglia are labeled.
Figure 3. Circuit model of the neuronal pattern generator for
swimming in Melibe. The model centers around 4
interneurons (L&R Int. 1's and L&R Int. 2's) which form
chemical synapses on antagonistic (Ant.) and synergistic
(Syn.) motorneurons. Circles indicate inhibitory
synapses; arrows indicate excitatory synapses. The
direct lines between ipsilateral Int. 1's and Int. 2's
indicate electrical connections.
Figure 4. Swimming frequencies of intact, free-swimming Melibe.
Average swimming frequency observed = 15.5 +2.6
cycles/minute.
Figure 5. Swimming frequencies of Melibe in the whole animal
preparation before serotonin application. Average
swimming frequency observed = 12.7 + 5.3
cycles/minute.
Figure 6. The effects of serotonin on the swimming frequency of
Melibe. Data were taken in the whole animal preparation.
The graph shows data from one representative animal.
