behavior such as lethargic swimming and no feeding. From this point
onward, experimental animals were selected based on their ability to
exhibit normal, vigorous behavior.
Preparation of Animals
lwo types of experimental preparations were used. Behavioral
observations were made using a whole animal preparation developed
by Diane Scott and Stuart Thompson. An incision was made on the
dorsal surface of the animal so that the head ganglia were exposed.
An additional incision was made just to the right of the head ganglia
and esophagus. A metal stage was inserted through this second
incision so that it rested directly ventral to both the esophagus and
head ganglia. The head ganglia and esophagus were then pinned to this
metal stage so that the ganglia were stabilized. Once the ganglia
were stabilized, the animal hung suspended in a tank of cold (13° C)
running sea water. While suspended, Melibe exhibit normal swimming,
crumple, and shrug behaviors. This preparation allowed behavioral
observations to be made while applying solutions to the head ganglia.
A second preparation was used for extracellular suction
electrode recording. The head ganglia and a portion of esophagus were
surgically removed from the animal by cutting all nerve roots to and
from the ganglia and by cutting through the esophagus just anterior
and posterior to the head ganglia. Particular care was taken to make
sure the circumesophageal connectives between the right and left
pedal ganglia were not damaged.
Once removed from the animal, the ganglia and esophagus were
bathed in a cold (14° C) artificial sea water solution (ASW)
containing 470 mM Nacl, 10mM KCI, 50mM MgCl», 10mM Cacl», and
10mM Hepes (pH 7.8). The ganglia were placed in a perfusion chamber
and pinned to a Sylgard base in the chamber. The perfusion chamber
