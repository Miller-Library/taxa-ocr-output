ABSTRACT
The modulation of the central pattern generator for swimming
in Melibe leonina by serotonin is the focus of this paper. Changes in
behavior and neuronal firing patterns were monitored during the
application of serotonin in order to elucidate how a neural circuit can
be modified by a chemical transmitter. Behavioral observations
indicate that micromolar concentrations of serotonin cause an
increase in swimming frequency immediately after application in a
whole animal preparation. Recordings from Interneuron 1 in the
swimming circuit show that serotonin causes a decrease in burst
duration and an increase in both instantaneous frequency and
spikes/second/burst immediately upon application. These three
parameters are all consistent with a transient acceleration and
tightening of the burst firing pattern of Interneuron 1. Ã„fter
washout, a second application of serotonin to the same ganglia
results in no significant changes in the firing pattern of Interneuron
1. Similar results were seen in a whole animal preparation; after 1-3
applications of serotonin no changes in swimming frequency occurred
upon additional application. Two possible mechanisms are given to
explain the effects of serotonin. One explanation is that serotonin
works as hormones affecting all the cells within the swimming neural
circuit. The other explanation is that serotonin works as a
neurotransmitter at specific synapses between the cells of the
circuit.
