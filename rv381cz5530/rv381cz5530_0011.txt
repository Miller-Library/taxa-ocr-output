CPG. Modulation of the CPG activity depends on its state of activity
when serotonin is applied. If the CPG is quiescent, serotonin
activates it. If the CPG is exhibiting a burst firing pattern, serotonin
tightens the bursts and increases the frequency.
There are two ways in which serotonin could be acting as a
transmitter on the swimming neural circuit. One explanation is that
serotonin has a hormonal, or neuromodulatory, effect on the CPG.
Serotonin may be released locally in the pedal ganglia neuropil where
processes from all the neurons in the neural circuit are present. Once
released, the chemical could locally diffuse and affect all the cells.
This type of local release system and hormonal action is analogous to
that proposed to explain the role of 5-HT in the crustacean STG
(Marder, 1987) In this system, serotonin has been shown to influence
the STG of all species. In P.interruptus, Beltz has theorized that
serotonin plays a hormonal role (reviewed by Marder, 1987).
An alternative explanation for serotonin's actions on the
swimming CPG is that 5-HT acts on specific synapses within the
circuit. Serotonin may act as a neurotransmitter at a synapse
between Interneuron 1 and another interneuron resulting in a change
in the firing properties of Int. 1 and the firing pattern of the circuit.
In either case (neuromodulator or neurotransmitter), serotonin
may change the synaptic efficacy within the circuit. 5-HT could
increase the strength of synapses within the circuit, thereby
tightening the bursts and causing the excitatory effects seen in this
study. In analogy, the monoamines serotonin, dopamine, octopamine,
and histamine, have been shown to change the relative strength of a
specific chemical or electrical synapse within crustacean neural
circuits (Harris-Warrick, 1989).
In addition to the excitatory effects of 5-HT on the swimming
CPG, the results given here suggest that the serotonin receptors
