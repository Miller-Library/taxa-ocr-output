Electrodes consisted of glass micropipettes with fire-polished tips.
Neuronal firing activity was monitored on a digital oscilloscope
(Nicolet) and recorded on a chart recorder (Gould/Brush).
RESULTS
Behavioral Observations
Live animals were observed in tanks of cold sea water devoid
of substrate so that their natural swimming behavior could be studied
and compared to the swimming behavior seen in whole animal
preparations. When dislodged from substrate with a tactile stimulus,
the Melibe were observed to crumple and slowly sink before initiating
swimming. Once swimming was initiated, the animals were observed
to swim without pausing until their foot touched substrate. A pause
was defined as a momentary stop at either midline or to one side
during a swim cycle. Observed swimming frequencies were fairly
constant with a mean of 15.5 + 2.6 cycles/minute (n=19; all values
given with s.d.) (Figure 4). Swimming frequency was defined as the
number of full alternating left and right bending cycles per minute.
Observations using the whole animal preparation were made to
assess pre-serotonin swimming behavior and frequency. Swimming
was only observed when the animal was suspended without a
substrate touching its foot. When a substrate was touching the foot,
the animal crawled on its surface. Dislodging of the foot from
substrate by a tactile stimulus resulted in crumple behavior which
was usually followed by swimming. Swimming frequencies ranged
from 4 to 22 cycles/minute (Figure 5) with an average of 12.7 + 5.3
cycles /minute (n=25). Maximum swimming frequencies resulted from
vigorous left and right contractions without pauses. Minimum
