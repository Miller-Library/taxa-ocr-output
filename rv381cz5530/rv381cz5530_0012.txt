within the circuit can be desensitized. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that after 1-3 applications of 5-HT to the whole animal
preparation, no noticeable behavioral changes are seen in response to
later applications. Additional evidence for this hypothesis of
receptor desensitization is that a second perfusion of 5-HT on the
same isolated ganglia results in no significant change in the three
parameters of burst firing pattern studied.
The mechanisms underlying the serotonergic modulation of the
swimming CPG of Melibe are complex and leave ample room for
f√ºrther experimentation. Additional studies will elucidate the
specific location and mechanism by which serotonin acts on this CPG.
Further experimentation on the effects of additional neuroactive
substances and peptides on the swimming CPG will also lend insight
into how neural circuits can be modulated to cause changes in
behavior and rhythmic motor patterns.
