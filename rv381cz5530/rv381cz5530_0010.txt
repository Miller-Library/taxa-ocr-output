extracellular recordings during the application of 5-HT showed this to
be true.
In the whole animal preparation, serotonin increased swimming
frequency immediately after application with an average increase of
181%. Serotonin was also observed to initiate alternating left and
right body wall contractions if the animal was standing on substrate,
a state in which swimming is normally inhibited.
These observations suggest that serotonin can cause the
initiation of swimming behavior. This indicates that serotonin may
activate the CPG for swimming from a quiescent state. This type of
excitatory activity has precedent in the crustacean stomatogastric
ganglion. In this system, proctolin and red pigment concentrating
hormone have been shown to strongly activate the pyloric system of C.
borealis in quiescent preparations (Marder, 1989).
Extracellular recordings from Interneuron 1 have shown
serotonin to have a modulatory effect on swimming CPG firing
patterns. In the isolated ganglia preparation, serotonin had an
excitatory effect on Int. 1. Of the three parameters studied, serotonin
affected all in an excitatory way. Burst duration was shown to
decrease while instantaneous frequency and spikes/second/burst
were both shown to increase. Thus, serotonin excites the swimming
CPG by tightening the bursting pattern. Similar modulation of a CPG
is seen in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) upon the
application of proctolin. In this system, Marder has shown that
proctolin can produce increases in cycling frequency in slow cycling
preparations in addition to increases in the number of action
potentials/burst from the LP neuron, an integral neuron in the pyloric
neural circuit (1987).
Based on behavioral observations and extracellular recording,
serotonin seems to have a state-dependent effect on the swimming
