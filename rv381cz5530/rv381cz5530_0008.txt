7 of 10 trials, neither sea water nor ASW + 0.1% ascorbic acid
resulted in an increase in swimming frequency. Only 3 of 10 control
applications resulted in an increase in swimming frequency with an
average increase of 169%. Application of control solutions to Melibe
standing on substrate also resulted in no noticeable behavioral
changes.
Effects of 5-HT Application in the Isolated Ganglia
Three parameters of the burst firing pattern of Interneuron 1
(Int 1) were analyzed. Burst duration is defined as the time interval
from the first spike of a burst to the last spike of a burst.
Instantaneous frequency is defined as 1/period where the period is
the time interval from the first spike of a burst to the first spike of
the next burst. Spikes/second/burst is used as a way of analyzing
how many spikes were occurring in a burst independent of burst
duration.
Application of 5-HT to Interneuron 1 in an isolated ganglia
resulted in an immediate statistically significant decrease in burst
duration and increase in instantaneous frequency. The most dramatic
example of this is seen in Figures 7, 8a, and 8b where serotonin
application results in a decrease in average burst duration from 10.8
+1.4 sec. to 3.1 + 0.6 sec. (Pc 0.001, df=19; df defined as degrees of
freedom) and an increase in instantaneous frequency from 3.1
cycles/minute to 9.0 cycles/minute (PÂ« 0.001, df=18). Once the burst
duration dropped, it began to slowly increase; and once the
instantaneous frequency increased, it began to steadily decrease.
Although both trends were significant, neither parameter returned to
its pre-serotonin value.
Serotonin also had a significant effect on the third parameter,
