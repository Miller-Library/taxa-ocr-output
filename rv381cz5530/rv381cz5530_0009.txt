spikes/second/burst (sp/s/b). In one recording, 5-HT application
resulted in an increase in the number of spikes/second/burst from
14.0 + 1.8 sp/s/b to a maximum of 16.9 + 0.8 sp/s/b (P« 0.01, df=28).
From this maximum value, the number of spis/b decreased to a
pre-serotonin level.
Consecutive applications of serotonin to the same isolated
ganglia preparation resulted in no significant changes in the three
parameters after a second application. As seen in Figures 9a, b, and c.
no significant increases or decreases were seen in burst duration,
instantaneous frequency, or spikes/second/burst upon the second
application of 5-HT.
A control was also done using ASW + 0.1% ascorbic acid as an
applied solution. The control solution was observed to have an
opposite effect on burst duration as 5-HT. Burst duration increased
from 2.1 +0.2 sec. to 2.7 + 0.1 sec. (P« 0.001, df=38). The control
solution was also observed to increase spikes/second/burst from 11.6
+1.7 sp/s/b to 15.2 + 0.4 sp/s/b (P« 0.001, df=18). Although this
effect is analogous to that seen with 5-HT, the time courses of the
two effects are different. Serotonin caused an increase in spis/b for
about 20 cycles while the control solution of ASW + 0.1% ascorbic
acid resulted in an increase for 5 cycles. Serotonin effects on sp/s/b
were seen immediately upon application of 5-HT while the effects of
the control solution were not seen until it had already been washed
out with ASW.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to explore the possibility that
serotonin had a modulatory effect on the central pattern generator for
swimming in Melibe leonina. Both behavioral observations and
