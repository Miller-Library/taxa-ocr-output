Interneuron 1. The recording was made in an isolated
ganglia. A 10-2 M solution of 5-HT was applied at the
arrow.
Figure 8a. The effects of serotonin on burst duration. Data were
taken by extracellular recording from Interneuron 1 in
an isolated ganglia. A solution of 10°9 M 5-HT was
applied at the arrow. Average burst duration before
5-HT application was 10.8 + 1.4 seconds. Average burst
duration immediately after application was 3.1 +0.6
seconds. Data shown are from a representative animal.
Figure 8b. The effects of serotonin on instantaneous frequency.
Data were taken by extracellular recording from
Interneuron 1 in an isolated ganglia. A solution of
10•° M 5-HT was applied at the arrow. Average
instantaneous frequency before 5-HT application
was 3.1 cycles/minute. Average instantaneous
frequency immediately after application was 9.0
cycles/minute. Data shown are from a representative
animal.
Figure 9a. The effects of two applications of serotonin on the
same ganglia with respect to burst duration. Data were
taken by extracellular recording from Interneuron 1 in
an isolated ganglia. A solution of 10°2 M 5-HT was
applied at the arrow. Data shown are from a
representative animal.
