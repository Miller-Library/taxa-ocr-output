and the other cell, Interneuron 2, is located on the dorsal surface of
the pedal ganglia (Figure 2). The two pairs of interneurons synapse on
motoneurons in the pedal ganglia, which innervate the body wall of
the animal and cause the swimming contractions. Interneuron 1 and
Interneuron 2 form mutually inhibitory synapses with the
interneurons of the other pair while electrically synapsing on each
other (Figure 3). The pattern of connections between the interneurons
of this CPG results in an oscillating burst firing pattern in which one
pair fires a burst while inhibiting the other pair and vice versa.
Modulation of the swimming CPG by serotonin (5-HT) is the
focus of this paper. Changes in behavior and neuronal firing patterns
were monitored during application of 5-HT in an effort to elucidate
how the output of one neural circuit can be modified by a chemical
transmitter that is widely found in molluscan nervous systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Melibe leonina were collected from Monterey Bay using SCUBA.
They were maintained at Hopkins Marine Station in flowing filtered
sea water at a temperature of 10-15Â° C. As a precautionary measure,
the sea water was degassed by filtering it through a column of
marbles to quard against bubble disease. The tanks were sheltered
from bright sunlight and were filled with kelp to provide the Melibe
with a somewhat natural habitat. The animals were fed mysids/brine
shrimp every other day. The mysids were collected by dip-net in kelp
beds.
For the first few weeks, the Melibe exhibited normal behavior
(swimming, crumple, feeding, shrug, etc.), and during this time,
experimental animals were selected at random from the individuals in
the tanks. After 3-5 weeks, the Melibe began to exhibit abnormal
