Figure 3
Vertical movement in the laboratory under simulated conditions
of incoming tides.
Figure 4
Typical displacement tracks for 3 individuals of Acmaea limatula.
Observations were made at intervals of 1.5 hours over a period
of 45 hours, May 2-4, 1966. Limpets did not always move between
successive observation periods even when submerged or awash.

Distribution of thirteen Acmaea limatula in relation to algae
available, for a period of 45 hours, May 2-4, 1966.
Figure 6
Distribution of fourteen Acmaea limatul√• at low tide in relation
to algae available within a 3.4 square foot area, mid-May, 1966.
Figure 7
Relationship of food available to food eaten in eight different
areas on Mussel Point, May, 1966. The lines at the ends of the
upper vertical bars show the range of variation encountered in
the five limpets examined in each region.
