and Lithothamnion. Strangely enough, A. limatula seems to
ignore the encrusting red alga Petrocelis (Figure 7g) even
though it grows in relative abundance within the intertidal
region inhabited by this limpet.
The non-encrusting algae are rarely ingested except for
tiny individuals of larger species, or species which form a short
fuzz growing close to the rock surface (Table 1, III, Figure 7b,e,f,h)
In such cases the thalli found were very small and capable of
being swallowed whole. Only once was a fragment of a large,
non-encrusting algae (not an entire thallus) found within a
stomach, although many such algae were available to;the indi¬
viduals analyzed. The item foundingested was a section of a
large brown alga which could not be found in the surrounding
area.
Figure 7h provides an excellant example of Acmaea limatula's
tendency to avoid the larger non-encrusting algae as food
sources. Although this limpet eats the encrusting coraline
algae Lithophyllum and Lithothamnion, the non-encrusting formline
Corallina was completely ignored here, even though it dominated
the region.
FOOD NICHE SPECIALIZATION IN ACMAEA LIMATULA AND
ACMAEA PELTA
Acmaea limatula and the very eurytopic limpet Acmaea pelta
may often be found occupying the same general areas and hab¬
itats in the intermediate and low intertidal zones on Mussel
Point. In order to substantiate the presence of overlapping
