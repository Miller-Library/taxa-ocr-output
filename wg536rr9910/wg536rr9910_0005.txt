A series of experiments w done in the laboratory in
order to substantiate Acmaea limatula's partial non-conformity
to the general rule for the vertical movements of transient
intertidal invertebrates. In all four experiments eight indi¬
viduals were subjected to simulated rising tides for periods of
1.5 hours; only the amount of light was varied. In each case,
fresh organismsewere collected from the field at low tide,
except for the first daylight experiment in which the same
individuals were used as in the preceeding darkroom experiment.
The specimens were placed in a line in the middle of a rough¬
ened sixteen-inch piece of marble, four facing upward, four
downward. After the activity of the animals had ceased, the marble
slab was placed in aquarium with the water level coming two
inches below the line of limpets. The water was then adjusted
so as to rise two inches every fifteen minutes and comressed air
vabbled
was  into the water to create simulated waves and splash.

These experiments (Figure 3) confirmed A. limatula's
general tendency to move downward during daylight incoming tides
and upward during nighttime incoming tides. It should be men¬
tioned here that the graphs denoting distance of vertical dis¬
placement for the experiments run in the daylight are not entire¬
ly accurate, for in both experiments two individuals moved off
