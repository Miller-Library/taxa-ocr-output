the distance between successive positions representing the net,
minimum displacement between observation periods. Figure 4 a,b,c
shows displacement tracks for three individuals. In order to
observe the movements of the limpets during periods of high tide
and rough water, it was necessary to wear a wet suit with two
weight belts and to use underwater writing material (x-ray film
with the emulsion removed and the surface roughened with sand-
paper proved very satisfactory for pencil notes).
As can be seen from Figure 1, individuals of Acmaea limatula
move actively only during periods when they are either splashed
by water or submerged. The time of day or night at which the
period of wetting occurs does not appear to influence the amount
of activity. The movement during periods of complete exposure
(0130 to 0600, May 3) approaches zero. During each period of
rising tide a large amount of activity was observed, but the
animals do not begin moving immediately upon being splashed, and
some remain inactive for a time after they are first submerged
(0600 to 0730, May 3; 1730 to 1900, May 3; and 0730 to 0900, May 4).
Following the incoming tide, the activity characteristically
drops during periods of high water, to be followed again by a
sharp increase as the tide is falling. These periods of high tide
are often accompanied by great surge, and many of the animals
stop moving altogether, clamping down on the surface of the rock.
Although the movement again increases as the tide receeds, it is
interesting to note that in all cases, except for the period
00
between 2230 to 0000, May 2, the activity does not reach the level
observed during incoming tides.
