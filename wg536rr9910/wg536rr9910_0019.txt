FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1
Movement of Acmaea limatula in relation to phases of the tide,
May 2-4, 1966. Time of day is shown at the top. Distance
moyed represents average net displacement for 13 limpets.
Since the limpets occupied different vertical positions on
the rock, the number exposed, awash, and submerged at each
observation time is indicated. HHW- higher high water; LHW-
lower high water.
Figure 2
Vertical movement of Acmaea limatula on a vertical rock face
at selected phases of tide and time of day, May 2-4, 1966.
Only the vertical components of movement are represented.
Each vertical bar shows total net displacement upward or
downward for 13 individuals over a three-hour period when
conditions on the rock surface changed from total exposure
to total submersion on a rising tide, or from total submersion
to total exposure on a falling tide. Numbers above and be¬
low each vertical bar show numbers of animals whose net dis¬
placement during the period was upward and downward, re-
spectively; numbers on the zero line indicate numbers of
animals remaining stationary, or showing only horizontal
movement.
