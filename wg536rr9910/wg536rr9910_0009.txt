Peyssonelia, this may not necessarily apply to other regions
along the Pacific Coast. It was noted, for example, that on
Point Lobos, just south of Carmel, California, fairly large
populations of A. limatula seemed to thrive on low horizontal
expanses of sandstone covered primarily with microscopic and
tock surfaces
and encrusting coralline algae. Extensive low, horizontal ewper
are not found on Mussel Point, but as can be seen from the
gut analyses below, A. limatula does eat microscopic algal films
theg ar
and encrusting coraline algae when available.
RELATIONSHIP OF FOOD AVAILABLE TO FOOD EATEN
To correlate the availability of various algae with the
foods actually eaten by Acmaea limatulay a series of gut anal¬
yses were performed on animals from differing areas. Eight
regions were chosen which showed either differences in the algal
species present, or in the relative abundance of the species.
Five limpets were collected from each region after making a
rough assessment of the relative amounts of different algae
available to the animals. The stomach contents of these 40
animals were observed microscopically and with the Rind help of
Doctor Isabella Abbott, the algal fragments present were ident¬
ified and an estimate of the relative abundance of different
species was made.
Figure 7a-h and Table 1 indicate that the main source of
food for A. limatula consists of the microscopic algae and of
the encrusting forms, Hildenbrandia, Peyssonelia, Lithophyllum,
