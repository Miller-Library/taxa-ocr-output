INTRODUCTION
Acmaea limatula Carpenter, 1864, has been studied from the stand-
point of taxonomy, distribution, and habitat (Test,11946), response
of the heartrate to changes in temperature (Segal, 1962), osmotic behavior
(Segal and Dehnel, 1962) and reproduotion and growth (Seapy, 1966).
Published accounts of other aspects of its biology, however, are lacking.
It has been the purpose of the present study to investigate the activity
pattern and feeding habits of this species.
GENERAL ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO PHASE OF TIDE
To determine the general activity pattern of A. limatula, field
observations on a population of thirteen limpets were carried out over a
period of forty-five hours from May 2 to May 4, 1966. The population was
looated at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, on a flat, vertical
granite face which was totally exposed and covered by water twice a day.
Coordinates were drawn on the surface of the rock with a lacquer paint,
and the animals were marked with colored paints to distinguish each
individual. The position and orientation of each animal were then observed
andd recorded at intervals of 1.5 hours. At the end of the 45-hour
observation period, a series of positions for each animal had been determined,
