whose activity was closely followed, homed consistently for a
period of four low tides, the percentage of homing animals may be
higher for the total population. In another field observation
made on Mussel point, nine of fifteen Acmaea limatula homed
consistently for a 48-hour period. These limpets were located
on a horizontal rater than a vertical surface, and although the
numberg of animals observed is small, the findings suggest that
homing may be more prevalent among populations of A. limatula
which must cope with desiccation accompanied by direct
sunlight.
DISTRIBUTION IN RELATION TO ALGAE
The algae present seem to play a significant role in the
distribution of Acmaea limatula. A good example of this can be
cited from the population whose movements are shown in Figure 1.
The surface of the vertical face on which the thirteen limpets
were located was occupied mainly by diatoms and microscopic
green and blue-green algae on the left-hand upper side of the
rock, and by encrusting red algae, mainly Hildenbrandia and
some Peyssonelia, on the lower right-hand side. These two
regions occupied approximately equal areas, and both areas
bore occasional small clumps of Endocladia or Gigartina. Though
Hildenbrandia and Peyssonelia dominated only about half of the
rock surface (Figure 5), the thirteen limpets observed spent a
combined total of 500 hours in this lower right-hand region.
