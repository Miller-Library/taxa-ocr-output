three transects, each three feet wide,extending from the low to
the high intertidal zones. Populations of the two species
overlap broadly, and several places were discovered where both
A. limatula and A. pelta were abundant see also Craig, 1966).
With such an overlap in distribution on the part of two spac
species in the same genus, one might expect considerable comp¬
etition, especially for food since both species are herbivores
and scrapers. Interestingly enough, little competition for food
actually exists. The two species live side by side,
A. pelta eating the larger, non-encrusting algal forms (Craig,1966)
and A. limatula ingesting primarily the encrusting red and
coraline algae.
SUMMARY
1. Individuals of Acmaea limatula move actively only during
periods when they are either splashed by water or submerged.
The time of day or night at which the period of wetting occurs
does not appear to influence the amount of activity.
Animals do not begin moving immediately upon being splashed,
and some remain inactive for a time after they are first
submerged. Activity reaches a high level as the tide is
rising, characteristically drops during periods of high tide,
and shows some increase again as the tide recedés.
3. With rising tides at night, a definite upward movement occurs.
During the daytime hours, the displacement is characteristically
