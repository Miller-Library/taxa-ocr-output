Acmaea limatula moves only when splashed or submerged, whether
this period comes during the day or night. Movement commences shortly after
wetting, rises to a high level as the tide comes in, drops during periods of
high tide, and increases again as the tide receeds. At night rising tides pro-
duce upward movement, but during the day the animals move downward on both
rising and falling tides, particuarly during the latter. Some homing occurs,
particularly on horizontal sufaces.
Acmaea limatula spends most of its time on the red encrusting algae
Hildenbrandia and Peyssonelia when these are available. The main foods of
the limpet are microscopic algae and the encrusting red and coraline algae
Hildenbrandia, Peyssonelia, Lithothamnion and Lithophyllum. Non-encrusting
forms are not eaten unless they are short, growing close to the rock surface.
Dietary studies suggest that in habitats where both A. limatula and A. pelta
occur, there is little competition for food.
