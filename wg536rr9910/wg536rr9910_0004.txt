VERTICAL MOVEMENT IN RELATION TO PHASE OF TIDE AND TIME OF DAY
The vertical displacement of the population of thirteen
limpets with reference to tide and time of day is shown in
Figure 2. It is clear that during periods of nocturnal rising
tides, Acamaea limatula shows a definite upward displacement,
but, during the daytime hours (0730 to 1350, May 3; and 0900
to 1500, May 4), the displacement is characteristically in a
downward direction, whether the tide is rising or falling.
This correlates nicely with the studies on light sensitivity
in various Acmaea species made by Ross (1966); A. limatula was
the only species studied showing a strong negative response to
light. It should also bennoted that the tendency to move down¬
ward during the daytime, in terms of either the number of
individuals moving or the total displacement, is proportionally
reateraduring the receedinggtides than on the incoming tides.
Again, although nocturnal receeding tides tend to produce ran¬
dom movement (five individuals moved up, four down in each case)
the displacement upward is proportionally less than that for the
rising nighttime tidesl
Rogers (1966), in his study of Acmaea scutum, found that
this species conforms to the more typical vertical displacement
pattern shown by many intertidal invertebrates (Wieser, 1952;
Glynn, 1965, Figure 30 and pp. 53-55). A. scutum moves up with
rising tides, and down with falling tides, no matter whether the
period of submersion comes during the day or night, though
upward movement during the day is less than that at night.
