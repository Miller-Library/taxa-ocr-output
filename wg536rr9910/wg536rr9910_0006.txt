first half hour. Their vertical downward movement was then listed
as a minus eight inches in both experiments, even though the
downward displacement might have been considerably greater had
the marble slab been longer.
HOMING TENDENCY
V
Homing, as used in this paper, is the consistent returning
to the same exactlocation with thessame orientation. Figures
4a and 4b illustrate the non-homing behavior shown by twelve
of the thirteen limpets in the population followed in the field.
These typical displacement tracks show that the animals spent
each consecutive exposed period in a new location.
Only one individual in the population homed consistently
for the entire forty-five hour period (Figure 4c). Interestingly
enough, the homing limpet not only returned to its home site as
the tide went out, but also during periods of high tide accomÂ¬

panied by surge. This type of behavior was also observed in
homing Acmaea limatula observed in other locations. They would
leave their home sites as the tide wastrising, return when the
tide was highiand then either remain at home or leave again as
the tide was falling. This behavior helps to emphasize the
characteristic drop in activity during periods of high tide as
shown in Figure 1.
