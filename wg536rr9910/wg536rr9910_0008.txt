During the 45-hour observation period, only two limpets ventured
into the region bearing mainly green and blue-green algae and
diatoms, where they spent a total of 85 hours.
Although individual Acmaea limatula can be found in widely
differing regions within the intertidal of Mussel Point, the
larger populations (up to 37/square yard) are invariably located
in regions where Hildenbrandia or Peyssonelia or both are
abundant. In order to demonstrate this relationship between
limpets and algae, a 3.4 square foot rock surface was chosen con¬
taining fourteen A. limatula, a fairly abundant crop of the
red-encrusting alga Hildenbrandia, and a wide variety of other
algal growths. A clear plastic sheet was placed over the region
and the areas occupied by the various algae were outlined with wax
marking pencils. The locations of the fourteen A. limatula were
noted. The drawing was traced onto a large piece of graph paper,
and the different regions were cut out and weighed. By compar¬
weights
ing these to the weight of one square inch of graph paper,
it was possible to get a fairly accurate dtermination of the areas
ptesent
occupied by the various algae. Figure 6 shows what
qualifative
more a observations confirm, that, at least during low
tide, A. limatula is often found in direct association with the
red encrusting algae. This, of course, is only an instantaneous
glance at the distribution of A. limatula, but it seems per¬
tenent when viewed in conjunction with Figure 5 and the gut
content analyses below.
