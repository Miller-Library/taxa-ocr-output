for C0, uptake experiments at 1 hour intervals or so. In this way, it
might be determined whether the chlorine residuals were affecting the
plant reversibly or not. This experiment could then be coupled with a
concurrent analysis of the plant pigments, in order to ascertain if the
exposure to OCl had caused any damage to these crucial parts of the
photosynthetic apparatus. From the results of these experiments, it might
be possible to decide if the chlorine was primarily attacking the pigments
or other vital components of the photosynthetic process. However, until
such time as these types of experiments can be performed, it is only
possible to state that residuals Chlorine levels of 5 ppm and greater de
adversely affect the photosynthetic activities of the three algae studied,
Prionitis lanceolata, Ulva lobata, and Macrocystis pyrifera
