Figure 1:
Chlorine residuals sampling stations: Detailed map of the Carmel outfall
area showing the onshore currents and the sampling stations.
Figure 2:
Chlorine residual levels at the Carmel outfall: Curve A represents the
values found for high tide. Curve B represents the values found for low
tide.
Figure 3:
Surface currents 1000 feet offshore from the Carmel outfall: 12 drift
bottles filled with fresh water were released from a skiff and followed
from shore. Dotted lines show the path of the bottles.
Figure 1:
Surface currents near Monastery Beach: 12 bottles were released in a line
perpendicular to the beach. Dye packets were attached to drift bottles
to follow their paths. Dotted lines represent the path that the bottles
followed.
Figure 5:
Bearings to the bottles at selected times: Both currents studies were
carried out by taking a bearing to the bottle at a specified time and
plotting these on a map.
Figure 6:
Drift bottle recoveries: Location and dated of recovery are listed along
with bottle number.
