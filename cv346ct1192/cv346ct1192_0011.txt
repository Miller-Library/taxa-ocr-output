SUMMARY
This project involved the determination of the persistence of
residual Chlorine in sea water and the determination of any effects,
either adverse or positive, of residual Chlorine from chlorinated
sewage effluents on the photosynthetic activities of three representative
algae, Prionitis lanceolata, (Rhodophyta ), Ulva lobata (Chlorophyta),
and Macrocystis pyrifera (Phaeophyta ). By using the technique of
quantitative C0, uptake to measure the rates of photosynthesis, a
correlation between the concentrations of Sodium Hypochlorite in the
experimental media and the experimental rates of photosynthetic activity
was discovered.
The results show that a residual level of 5 ppm Chlorine in sea
water does adversely affect the photosynthetic activities of these algae.
in the case of Ulva lobata by as much as 25 %. Higher concentrations of
residual Chlorine have even greater effects,with 15 ppm residual Chlorine
giving an 80 % reduction in the photosynthetic rate of Macrocystis
pyrifera.
