Chlorine residual studies and subjective observations that I made
of the City of Carmel's sewage outfall suggested that a correlation between
algal photosynthetic rates and the chlorine residual activity of the sea
water might exist; however, a primary productivity analysis by the Winkler
method for dissolved oxygen was impossible in this case, as both Cl, and
OCl react very quickly with S,0,, the standard reagent in such analyses.
The use of a modification of the Bean et. al. (1953) C0, uptake method
circumvented this reaction, allowing the photosynthetic rates at different
chlorine residual concentrations in the selected marine algae to be measured.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The chlorine residual analysis was carried out using the Lodometric
method with a starch endpoint described in Standard Methods for the Exam-
ination of Water and Wastewater (1965). Samples were collected in 250 ml
plastic reagent bottles and brought back to the lab within one hour of
sampling and tested immediately. It appeared from preliminary data that
in a 24- hr.period after the sampling, bacteria in the sewage capable of
living on S,0, would cause the results to be much higher that they should
have been. This was combatted by adding a drop of CCl, to each sample
bottle along with the standard S,O, reagent and by immediate testing.
The 10 sampling stations around the Carmel outfall and their relation to
the onshore currents are shown in Figure 1.
The results of the chlorine residuals analysis around the Carmel
outfall area are presented in Figure 2. This figure shows a rapid decrease
of the chlorine residuals in the sea water with increasing distance from
the point of sewage discharge.
