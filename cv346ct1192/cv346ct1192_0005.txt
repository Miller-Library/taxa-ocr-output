residual to work with because it is the major component of the chlorine
residuals in sea water due to the following reaction; ((Baker, 1969
+ HC

C19 + H,0
The NaoCl solution was made up with distilled water and not filtered sea
water. It was felt that the OCl would be more stable in distilled water,
as it normally will very rapidly begin to decompose in the presence of an
easily oxidized material, such as would be present even in freshly filtered
sea water.
After weighing, 0.2 ml of 5C/ml NaHC 0, solution was added to each
centrifuge tube containing the algal discs. This was immediately followed
by the addition of the appropriate amount of NaoCl solution necessary to
produce the proper initial concentration of hypochlorite, which was never
more than 0.24 ml. The centrifuge tubes were then sealed with vaccine caps,
swirled to mix the solution, and placed in the incubator for i hr. This
incubator consisted of an outer plastic tub with both a water inflow and
outflow tube for cooling water, an inner clear plastic box lined with
aluminum foil and filled with fresh water, and a foil covered, wooden
tube rack that was slanted at approximately 450 to the counter top in the
hood. This slant allowed the algal discs to rest at the bottom of the
tubes in a plane parallel with the counter top and perpendicular to the
majority of the incident light. The water level in the inner plastic box
was set such that the water would cover the centrifuge tubes up to the
5 ml mark, and the rate of flow of the cooling water through the outer
plastic tub was set as necessary to keep the temperature of the inner bath
at 20Â° c.
The light source was a fluorescent light bank consisting of two 18
watt, 18 inch, soft white, G.E. bulbs in a aluminum foil covered hood. The
