INTRODUCTION
Sewage which has undergone only primary treatment, i.e. removal
of grease and floatables, preliminary digestion, and treatment with
Chlorine, has been discharged into the intertidal areas at Pacific Grove
and Carmel, California until recently. Under an order from the State
Regional Water Quality Control Board to "clean up" their sewage because
of high Coliform counts, very large amounts of Chlorine were introduced
into the effluent in the winter of 1969, in order to disinfect the sewage
effluent.
In fresh water systems, chlorination has proven to be a highly
effective and relatively inexpensive method of controlling harmful
bacteria. Chlorination of public swimming pools and fresh water supplies
are common practices, and some cities are even chlorinating their storm
sewer runoffs. (Pavia, et. al,1969) Enough information about such chlorination
systems has been accumulated in order to understand both the beneficial
and deleterious effects of Chlorine and Sodium Hypochlorite on the flora
and fauna indigeneous to those fresh water systems. However, the effects
of liquid Chlorine and Sodium Hypochlorite upon the marine flora remains
largely unknown.
A comprehensive study of all the effects of liquid Cl, and Naocl on
marine algae is a prodigious undertaking and is clearly beyond the scope
of this project. Therefore, this examination has been limited to determining
the effects of Chorine residuals on the primary productivity of Prionitis
lanceolata Harvey, Ulva lobata (KÃ¼tzing ) Setchel and Gardner, and
Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus ) C.A. Agardh, a red, green, and brown
alga respectively.
