hetic rates from blade to blade, the dises were eut from the blades
the following manner. With Macrocystis, 5 discs were cut from an
area of 4 cm. near the tips off 4 blades taken from the same plant
near the center of the frond. One disc of each set of 5 discs from each
ade was used for each concentration of Ocl". In this way, even if one
blade had a photosyntheitc activity much more or less than the other blades
one disc from that blade would be in each set of the four replicates run
at each of the 5 Ocl concentrations,(0, 1, 5, 10, and 15 ppm), which woul
distribute any such effect equally among the results.
With Prionitis, all the discs were cut from different blades because
he blades were not big enough to allow more than one disc from near the
apical point of the blade. The blades were chosen all of approximately
he same length, from the same thallus, and from as close to the top
the thallus as possible.
Uva, however, was the hardest from which to get reproducible samples
The dises were cut from near the margins of the blade, as close together
as was feasible. It is recognized that this would not necessarily remove
all the natural variabliity of photosynthetic activity in the dises, bu
was assumed that such close sampling would limit it as much as was
ssible.
After the wet weights of the dises were taken, the dises, weighing
om 1.6 mg to 2.4 mg for Ulva, from 5.6 to 6.2 mg for Prionitis, and
com 5.9 to 6.3 mg for Macrocystis, were placed in 12 ml graduated centrifuge
ubes with enough freshly filtered sea water (0.45 micron millipore filter

and  ml of the Naocl solution were added. Naocl was chosen as the chlorine
