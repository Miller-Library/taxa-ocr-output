species of macroscopic plant life within 5 feet of the end of the outfall
pipes. At the Pacific Grove outfall, where the chlorine residuals
sometimes reach levels greater than 10 ppm (Remsen, per. comm.), Prionitis
lanceolata is the only macroscopic plant within 5 feet of the sewage
discharge, and they seem abundant; yet there are no green algae or brown
algae within this area. This could be expected in such an area of high
chlorine residuals, judging from the results of this study
It should also be noted from Figure 10 that Ulva lobata shows the
greatest decrease in photosynthetic activity at lower concentrations of
OCl. This might be a function of the particular pigments that Ulva, a
green algae, would have;oi.e. the chlorophylls may be more susceptible
to chlorine than the pigments of the red and brown algae. It might alse
be explained by the fact that the blades of Ulva lobata are much thinner
than the blades of Prionitis lanceolata or Macrocystis pyrifera. This
might have allowed the penetration of OCl into the intracellular centers
of photosynthetic activity to be more pronounced in Ulva than in Prionitis
or Macrocystis, but the data cannot support either of these hypotheses to
the exclusion of the other.
The experimental results that have been obtained do apparently show
an adverse effect of chlorine residuals on the rates of photosynthesis
in the algae examined; however, other interpretations are possible.
Since no attempt was made to make the OCl solution isotonic with the
filtered sea water used in the experiments, it might be argued that the
gradient of salinity present in the samples caused these effects. But the
greatest decrease in the salinity was present in the 15 ppm OCl test
solution. Only 0.24 ml of 312.4 ppm OCl and 0.20 ml of Nac Ho, solutions
were added to 4.56 ml of filtered sea water in order to make up this 15 ppm
