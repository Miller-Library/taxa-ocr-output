light bank was placed over the centrifuge tube rack so that it was 4"
from the algal discs. It was not possible, however, to eliminate outside
radiation completely. In order to take the outside radiation into account,
a complete set of runs was made only from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. or from 11 p.m.
to 2 a.m.. This was necessary because it had been observed in preliminary
runs that the photosynthetic rates of those discs tested in the daylight
hours of bright sunlight were consistently about 10 % higher than those
discs tested under the incubator light source alone.
As soon as the testing period was finished, the sea water solution of
NaHC0, and NaoCl was drawn off with a 10 ml disposable syringe. The dscs
were washed vigorously with 4 5 ml portions of filtered sea water, and
the water was drawn off as before. The discs, still in the centrifuge
tubes, were covered with 0.5 ml of 2 N methanolic KOH, and the tubes placed
in an 80Â°C sand bath for thirty minutes. After thirty minutes, 30 %
20 was added to the solution in the tubes in 0.05 ml increments as
necessary to dissolve the disc completely. When the H,O, activity had
ceased, the contents of the centrifuge tube were diluted to 3.0 ml total
volume with distilled water. Two 1.5 ml aliquots of this solution were
transferred quantitatively from the centrifuge tube by means of a disposable
pipette with two 15 ml aliquots of Bray's scintillation fluid into 2
scintillation vials and counted for 10 minutes for C activity on a
Nuclear Chicago Scintillation Counter Model Unilux II.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The comparative rates of photosynthesis for each concentration of
NaoCl were determined by dividing the total disintegrations per minute (dpm.
obtained from the dissolved algal discs by the milligrams wet weight of
