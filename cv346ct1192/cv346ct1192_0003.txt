had decreased to less than 0.1 ppm. Beyond 130 feet to either side of
the sewage discharge, residual chlorine in the water was not detectable
with this test. Sampling in a line parallel to the shoreline and nearly
1000 feet out to sea revealed no detectable residual chlorine; however,
others (Grey and Nakata, personal communication) found chlorine residuals
as far as 3000 feet to the south of the outfall. From this it might be
inferred that the sewage field was staying close to shore and moving south.
Figures 3,4,5, and 6 give the results of the current studies done at the
Carmel outfall area. It can be seen that the currents do indeed run just
offshore in the vicinity of the outfall and head south toward Monastery
Beach and Whaler's Cove.
After the residual chlorine levels in sea water had been established,
the 3 algae, Prionitis lanceolata, Macrocystis pyrifera, and Ulva lobata
were selected for the primary productivity tests. Prionitis (Rhodophyta)
was selected because it was the commonest of all the algae near the Pacific
Grove sewage outfall where the chlorine residuals in the water were found
to be greater than 10 ppm (Remsen, personal communication). Ulva lobata
(Chlorophyta) was selected because it was conspicuously absent form the
immediate area around the same outfall. Finally, Macrocystis,in addition
to belonging to the brown algae group, was selected because the proposed
Carmel sewage outfall extension would move the effluent boil out into the
kelp beds, and it would be of interest to know what effects Chlorine
might have upon Macrocystis before the outfall pipe was extended.
Labelling of the algae was accomplished by allowing small discs,
approximately 5 mm in diameter, cut from the algae with a +2 cork borer
to carry on photosynthesis in a sea water solution of Nahc 0, with and
without NaoCl. In an attempt to limit the natural variation in photosyn
