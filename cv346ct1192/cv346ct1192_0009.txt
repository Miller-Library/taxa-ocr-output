OCl experimental solution. This represents a decrease of only 8.8 % in
the total salt concentration of the experimental media from the control
media, but this would hardly account for the 80 % decrease in the photo¬
synthetic activity of Macrocystis pyrifera at 15 ppm OCl or the 40 %
decrease of Prionitis lanceolata at 15 ppm OCl".
The variability of the results for 1 and 5 ppm OCl can be explained
using the fact that only the initial concentration of OCl in the centrifuge
tubes was known. Since OCl is a highly reactive ion that rapidly undergoes
reduction in the presence of any easily oxidized substance, the actual
residual OCl concentration could have varied due to the different levels
of oxidizable materials in each centrifuge tube. Furthermore, no additional
OCl could be added to the tubes after the run was started because this
would have changed the critical concentration of available NahcO, in the
tubes; consequently, any natural variation in the resistance of an alga¬
to the chlorine effects might have been accentuated by the variable lowering
of the actual OCl concentrations in the centrifuge tubes. If this were
the case, one would expect to see the standard deviation of the replicates
decreasing with increased OCl concentrations because the small deviations
from the initial OCl concentrations would become less important and because
the differences in the resistance to chlorine would be less at higher Ocl
concentrations. The experimental results show rather definitely that the
standard deviations do decrease with increasing OCl concentration. (See
Table 1 )
The experimental results suggest several types of experiments that
need to be done before the mechanism of this effect can be understood.
One such experiment would be to expose an entire plant to a concentration
of OCl found previously to be detrimental to that plant for several hours,
remove the plant to a fresh sea water aquarium, and then sample that plant
