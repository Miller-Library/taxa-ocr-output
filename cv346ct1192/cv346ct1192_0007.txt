the discs. Each disc was run for exactly 1 hr, so the above rate values
have the following dimensions of dpm/ mg wet weight/ hr. Comparison of
these experimental rates was done by taking the mean C''0, uptake rate
of the control discs (O ppm Chlorine residuals) as 100%. Dividing the
mean experimental C0, uptake rates by the mean control rate gåve the
values in per cent of the mean control CO, uptake rate, which were then
compared by plotting them against the appropriate concentration of OCl
in parts per million. The results for Macrocystis are presented in Fig. 7,
those for Prionitis and Ulva are presented in Figs. 8 and 9 respectively.
These figures show that the concentrations of 15 ppm and 10 ppn OCl cause
a definite decrease in the photosynthetic activities of each of the 3
algae tested; however, the results for the OCl concentrations of 5 ppm
and éspecially i ppm are much less certain due to a greater degree of internal
variation than was observed for the control discs and the discs in 15 and
10 ppm OCl. (See Table 1) Nonetheless, the OCl" concentration of 5 ppm
does show a decrease of 25% in the photosynthetic rate of Ulva lobata
and a 12% decrease in the photosynthetic rate of Macrocystis pyrifera.
Prionitis lanceolata, however, did not show an effect for either 5 ppm
or 1 ppm OCl", and further, the reductions in photosynthetic rates of
Prionitis for the 10 and 15 ppn concentrations were considerably less than
those found for Macrocystis and Ulva at the same OCl concentrations. This
is presented graphically in Fig. 10. It would appear that Prionitis
lanceolata (Rhodophyta) can resist the effects of OCl better than
Macrocsytis pyrifera (Phaeophyta) or Ulva lobata (Chlorophyta), at least
in the lab. However, close observation of both the Carmel subtidal sewage
outfall and the Pacific Grove intertidal sewage outfall reveals that
Prionitis lanceolata Harvey and Prionitis andersonii Eaton are the dominant
