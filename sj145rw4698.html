Introduction
The effects of sewage effluents on the marine environ-
ment are not well understood. While fresh water and estuarine
pollution have been rigorously studied, (Jones, 1964;
Ingram, Mackenthum, Bartsch, 1966 ), the marine situation
has been sorely neglected. A major reason for this has
been the difficulty in isolating sewage effects in a
complicated marine environment. At the present time local
and State Health Agencies have been relegated to using
coliform bacteria counts as the only standard measure of
pollution. Experience has shown, however, that this method
is unsatisfactory (Carter, Carpenter, Whaley, 1967;
Nuebaum, Garver, 1955 ). A more accurate and substantial
indicator of marine pollution is needed. It was with this
problem in mind that the present study was undertaken.
Pacific Grove, California, discharges approximately
1.6 million gallons of primary treated sewage daily from an
outfall located on Point Pinos within the boundaries of the
Pt. Pinos Lighthouse Reservation, a Marine Life Preserve.
The end of the outfall is located approximately 160 meters
from the base of the point in a rocky intertidal area on the
south side, and lies one foot below mean lower low water
(-1.0 ft.) in a region that recieves heavy surf.
Studies carried out during the Spring of 1970 at the
Hopkins Marine Station revealed significant differences in
macrofaunal and floral distribution between the immediate
outfall area and other, less polluted regions of the point.

However, these overt differences were limited to a small
area of no more than 20 meters radius from the end of the
pipe. A search for an indicator of more widespread and
subtle effects suggested the efficacy of studying micro-
faunal distribution in the Pt. Pinos area. Might not
microfaunal distributions and associations reflect subtle
differences in the environment not mirrored by by macro-
fauna? Specifically, might algae-microfaunal associations,
which are numerous and constant for a given defined region
(Glynn, 1963 ) serve as an indicator of marine pollution?
I decided to study the distribution of microfauna on
three species of algae characteristic of low (-1.0 to +1.0
ft.), medium (+1.0 to +3.0 ft.) and high (+3.0 to 15.0 ft.)
tidal heights in order to determine the effects of the effluent
as well as the role played by tidal height.
Material and Methods
Preliminary information on currents and physical-
chemical attributes of the study area was obtained from
investigations made in the Spring of 1970 at the Hopkins
Marine Station (Anon, 1970).
Samples of algae were taken from around the point at
convenient locations. All sample locations were resampled
one to three times. The algae chosen were all red algae,
the most extensive group present in this area.
Endocladia muricata was chosen as being the representative
alga of the high intertidal. (+3.0 to +5.0 ft.). The sample
sites ranged from +3.0 to +5.0 feet, with all samples
being taken from horizontal surfaces. All sample sites
were equally exposed to high tide wave action. Figure 2
shows the location of the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endocladia : Exact'>Endocladia</span> sample sites.
Replicate samples are grouped into area for convenience
and future reference. No Endocladia samples were taken
from Area l to Area 2 due to the fact that no Endocladia
could be found in this area. Whether or not the absence
of this alga can be attributed to the effects of the ef-
fluent is unclear.
Prionitis lanceolata was chosen as being a representa-
tive alga of the mid-intertidal. (+1.0 to +3.0 ft.)
This species was the only macroalga present in the im-
mediate outfall area. Figure 3 shows the location of the
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Prionitis : Exact'>Prionitis</span> sample sites, which range from 0.0 to 14.5 feet.
Exposure ranges from semi-protected on the north side of the
point to full wave shock in areas 3-8.
Corralina vancouveriensus was chosen as a representative
alga of the low intertidal. (-1.0 to +1.0 ft.) Sample
sites range from -1.0 to +1.0 feet. Figure 4 shows the
location of these sample sites, all of which were open to
direct wave action at low tide. Due to adverse conditions
however, fewer <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Corralina : Exact'>Corralina</span> samples were collected.
Each of these algae are perennials, and as such can
be expected to have a permanent population of associated
microfauna (Abbott, 1970).
18.
Wave action ranged from slight in areas 1, 2 and
3, to heavy in areas 4-9 (Figure 3). Samples collected
from the west end of the point, area 10, were protected
from wave action but experienced a strong surge on both
rising and falling tides. Samples from areas 11, 12 and
13 recieved a moderate amount of wave action. Sites
further east along the north side of the point, area 12,
recieved only light surf (Figure 2).
Collections were made at periods of low tide,
employing a chisel to remove the alga and it's holdfast
from the rocks. These were placed in plastic bags and
brought back to the lab for analysis. From-5.0 to 20.0
grams of Endocladia and Corralina were collected on each
occasion except where not available in areas 1 and 2.
In those cases the algae available was taken. In the case
of Prionitis samples one entire plant and holdfast was
taken for each sample. Samples were taken from ten areas
each time, with a 2-4 day interim between replicates.
The samples were analyzed by placing them in finger bowls
with 5% ethanol in distilled water and removing the organisms
under a dissecting scope. Organisms were identified as
closely as possible then preserved in 80% ethanol for
further reference. The algae were dried for-24 hours at
60 C in a drying oven and weighed.
The Simpson and Shannon-Weiner indices were used to
compute the species diversity for each sample. The
15
Simpson index is given by the formula
where Nis the total number
D- N(N-1
of animals found
En(n-1)
and nis the number of individuals
of each species.
This index corresponds to the number of randomly selected
pairs of individuals that must be drawn from a community
in order to have an even chance of obtaining a pair with
both individuals of the same species.
The Shannon-Weiner index is based on the Shannon-Weiner
function from the field of information theory. As a
diversity index for biotic communities the function
describes the average degree of uncertainty of predicting
the species of an individual picked at random from the
community. It is given by the formula
D= 3.219 (19510 -1Enlog 10n)
where N and nare the same as for the Simpson index
(Cox, 1967).
Neither index is free from sample size bias, but
both are equally affected. It must be kept in mind,
however, that I am applying these indices to samples of
different sizes. The Simpson index would be expected to
give low results for samples containing one species
in great excess of the others.

Results
Table l shows the results of a one day chemical
study made in the Pt. Pinos area. This table also
includes information on temperature, pH and dissolved
oxygen levels determined at both high and low tides.
It can be seen from the low tide figures that a gradient
exists on either side of the outfall, which suggests
that areas 2-5 in Figure 2 may be the most effected by
the effluent. Note that the differencesiin physical-
chemical parameters at high tide all but disappear.
This suggests that at high tide the effluent is diluted
considerably with fresh seawater. Figure 1 shows a
composite of the local currents at both high and low
tides. This data appears to account for the distribution
of the effluent around the point. Coupling the information
from Table 1 and Figure 1 one would expect to find damage
in areas 3, 4, 6 and 11 in Figure 3, as well as areas
in the immediate vicinity of the outfall.
As mentioned earlier, the distribution of macrofauna
and flora in the immediate outfall area shows a marked change
from other areas of the point. The numbers of algal and
invertebrate species present is severely reduced, and
many of those organisms whish are present appear sickly
and unhealthy.
Endocladia: Table 2 shows the tabulated data for
samples of Endocladia. Note the variation in the total
number of taxonomic groups in relation to distance from
the outfall. Also of some significance is the mean number
16
of animals per gram dry weight for the replicate areas
and the ranges for the diversity indices at increased
distances from the outfall. Table 3 shows the species
composition of the animals found. Species seem to be
rather evenly distributed, except for the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Amphipoda : Exact'>Amphipoda,</span>
which do not appear in samples taken in the immediate
area of the outfall (10 meters radius). Figure 5 illus-
trates the distribution by phyla. Again, other than the
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Arthropoda : Exact'>Arthropoda,</span> there appears to be a relatively even dis-
tribution. A plot of the mean diversity indices and
mean numbers of taxonomic groups for the replicate areas
is shown in Figure 6, and these curves show dips at the
outfall and at area 9 across the point from the outfall.
Prionitis: Table 4 presents the tabulated data for
Prionitis. Again, note the changes in the total number of
taxonomic groups present and the diversity indices at sites
around the point. Area 9 shows a very definite cut-off
line where both of these parametersgo from low values to
quite high values. It may be that these figures reflect
the radius of effect of the effluent for this species of
alga and it's microfauna. Table 5 demonstrates the species
composition of the samples. It appears from this table that
Nereid worms, Amphipods and Copepods by their absence,
and <span style='background-color:grey' title='Tethymyia aptena : Fuzzy'>Tethymia aptena,</span> a fly larvae, by it's presence may
serve as pollution indicators. The distribution by
phyla (Figure 7) suggests that the Arthropods, Annelids
and Molluscs are effected in the outfall area within a radius
of 25 meters. Figure 8 represents a plot of the mean
diversity indices and numbers of taxonomic groups as a
function of distance from theoutfall. Note the strong dip in
the region of the outfall, and the smaller dip in area 11.
Corralina: The tabulated data for Corralina is shown
in Täbles6. Once again, note the changes in total number
of taxonomic groups and diversity indices in sample sites
near and away from the outfall. Also, the numbers of orga-
nisms per gram dry weight shows a drop in samples taken in
the outfall area. Table 7 demonstrates the species compo-
sition for these samples. Note the marked differences in
the occurence of the Amphipods, Puggetia and the tunicates.
Also, to a lesser extent, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus : Exact'>Pagurus,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mohnia : Exact'>Mohnia</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tricolia : Exact'>Tricolia</span> show
similar trends.
Figure 9 shows the distribution by phyla for the
Corralina samples. Only the Arthropoda seem to show any kind
of gradient through the outfall area. A plot of the mean
number of taxonomic groups and diversity indices against the
areas sampled is shown in Figure 10.
Specific indicators of pollution: Figure 11 shows a
listing of the species found associated with Corralina (top)
and Prionitis (bottom) which appear to show the greatest
variation in abundance as related to the presence of the out-
fall. Of the species found with Endocladia, only the Amphipods
showed distributional effects related to the outfall area.

Discussion
The results indicate that the primary treated effluent
is causing changes in the distribution of algal microfauna
in the Pt. Pinos area. This is shown by the fact that gra-
dients in microfaunal populations through the outfall area cor-
respond with chemical gradients produced by the dispersed
effluent. Current study results show how the effluent may
be dispersed in this manner.
That a change in the microfauna exists is shown by var-
iations in diversity indices, total number of taxonomic groups
and mean numbers of animals per gram dry weight found in
samples within the area influenced by the effluent. These
variations are in full accord with the dispersal pattern of
the effluent material. In two species, Prionitis and
Corralina, certain species found in other areas completely
disappear from the samples taken in the vicinity of the out-
fall, suggesting that they might be potential indicator
species.
The effect of tidal height is important. Endocladia
showed radical variations in the immediate outfall area, but
at greater distances seemed relatively unaffected. However,
it does seem that at high tide contaminated water crosses the
point and effects the community on the north side. This
again is suggested by the pattern of effluent movement at
high tide.
Prionitis showed a marked effect in the outfall area,
with the influence of the sewage effluent apparently extending
10.
farther to the east and west than in Endocladia. Only
a slight effect is observed in Prionitis across the point
from the outfall. As the primaryly fresh water effluent
wouls tend to float on the surface, it may be that at high
tide the water crossing the point affects only the higher
intertidal species such as Endocladia. When this water cros-
sing the point encounters incoming water on the north side of
the point, its movement may be slowed to the point where
heavier materials in the effluent may settle out. Thus
while the mid-intertidal may not be effected, the material
settling out may effect the low intertidal, as observed
below with Corralina.
Corralina shows broad-based effects extending in both
directions from the outfall, with a slight effect seen in
the area directly across the point from the outfall.
From these results it seems that Endocladia is only
subjected to the effects of the sewage at high tides, when
the effluent is most dilute (Table 1). Also, at high tide
polluted water crosses the point and apparently damages the
communities there in a limited area, This is in accord with
the earlier predictions made on the basis of chemical and
current studies. Prionitis is subjected to effluent laden
waters on rising, falling and during high tides. Corralina
is exposed to strongly polluted waters only at very low
tides! At other times the polluted water covering this alga
are probably well diluted. The most strongly polluted water
would at all times be found on the surface due to the fresh
water nature of the effluent.
Within a radius of 50 meters from the outfall damage
162
11.
appears to be noticeable. Outside of this area, variations
in the parameters measured cannot be attributed solely to
the presence of effluent because of natural variation.
However, sewage effluent may be contributing to some of
the differences observed. Mid-intertidal and low intertidal
algae and microfauna seem to be the most strongly effected,
with high intertidal species effected but slightly.
It also appears that certain species of animals,
notably the Amphipods, Copepods, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pugettia : Exact'>Pugettia,</span> Nereid worms,
Tricolia, Mohnia and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Barleeia : Exact'>Barleeia</span> by their absence and
Tethymia aptena, by its presence on the effected algae may
serve as specific indicators of pollution. More research
concerning the distribution of these species in polluted
waters may prove their usefulness to field workers looking
for a criterion of marine pollution.
A specific ecological survey, as presented here, can be
usefull in showing the extent and severity of damage in
polluted areas:. However, such a study demands considerable
time and effort on the part of the investigator. This
approach has provided insights into possible specific
indicators of pollution, which may be usefull tools in
combating the degredation of our environment.
