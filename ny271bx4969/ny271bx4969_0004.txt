a given hypoxic insult. This strategy does not, however, preclude the changes in
glycolytic enzyme activity that are typically seen with the other strategies.
Oxygen has long been known to be a potent regulator of gene expression.
Cultured mammalian cells will coordinately up-regulate all II glycolytic enzymes when
exposed to hypoxia (5). In 1991, the hypoxia-inducible factor-I (HIF-1) was discovered
in studies on the human erythropoeitin gene (6). In response to hypoxic condtions, HIF-1
promotes the expression of genes with the HIF-I binding site in their 5' and 3' flanking
regions. Many genes have been shown to be HIF-I inducible including those encoding
erythropoietin and vascular-endothelial growth factor, both of which are involved in
increasing oxygen delivery via increased blood supply to tissues. Furthermore, the
glycolytic enzymes are inducible by HIF-I in mammalian systems, with the exception of
phosphoglucoisomerase and phosphoglucomutase (5). Increases in transcriptional
activity often lead to increased gene products in the cell, and thus the actions of HIF-I are
likely to increase cellular concentrations of glycolytic enzymes.
Enzymatic activity could also be affected by the actions of allosteric modifiers
The advantage of such a mechanism is the speed with which it could be implemented and
the lower energetic cost, since protein synthesis is expensive. One such modifier is
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP). F-2,6-BP is a potent activator of
phosphofructokinase, which is considered to be one of the rate governing glycolytic
enzymes. Thus, by increasing or decreasing the levels of F-2,6-BP, G. mirabilis could
rapidly regulate glycolytic flux to compensate for hypoxic stress.
In order to understand what type of strategies are employed by the longjawed
