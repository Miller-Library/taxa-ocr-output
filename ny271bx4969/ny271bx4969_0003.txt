small amount of water lest in crab burrows as the tide goes out may fall to very low
levels. Whether G. mirablis burrows itself or borrows the burrows of its prey, it seems
likely that this species of fish is regularly exposed to hypoxic or even anoxic conditions
on a tidal time course. Furthermore, G. mirabilis is tolerant to a wide range of
environmental fluctuations, including fluctuations in temperature and salinity. Recent
studies have found that the longjawed mudsucker also has a significant tolerance to low
oxygen conditions and can survive in hypoxic waters for up to 7 days time (unpublished).
The mudsucker's wide range of tolerances coupled with its tidal exposure to hypoxic
conditions make it a good model for studying hypoxia tolerance.
There are two general strategies for dealing with hypoxic stress: metabolic
suppresion and increased glycolytic flux (2). Many non-vital functions, on both the
cellular and behavioral levels, can be suppressed to reduce the ATP requirements of an
organism. For example, most protein synthesis in the liver is shut down and unnecessary
locomotion is avoided (3). Alternatively, glycolytic flux can be increased to compensate
for decreased aerobic ATP production. Many species in the genus Carassius, e.g. the
goldfish and crucian carp, even utilize an alternative pathway, with ethanol as an end
product, to regenerate NAD (4). This allows them to maintain relatively high glycolytic
flux rates, without the potentially acidotic side effects of lactate as the glycolytic end
product. Most vertebrates, however, must suffer the acidotic side effects if forced into
prolonged anaerobic catabolism. In both strategies alterations in glycolytic enzyme
activities are observed.
Another possible mechanism for coping with regular hypoxic stress is the
maintainence of high glycolytic capacity in the tissues, thereby reducing the magnitude of
