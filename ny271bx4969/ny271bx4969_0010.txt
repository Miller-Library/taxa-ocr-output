Furthermore, it has been found that the brains of G. mirabilis contain unusually high
concentrations of LDH (pers. comm. George Somero) and it may be that all of the
glycolytic enzymes have high standing stock concentrations like LDH. Thus, pre-
hypoxia enzyme concentrations appear to be sufficient to support vital energetic needs in
low oxygen stress.
My findings are also inconsistent with the hypothesis that glycolytic enzymes in
G. mirabilis are HIF-I inducible. This inconsistency would be a significant break from
the mammalian paradigm of hypoxic defense strategies. Because glycolytic enzymes are
highly conserved across evolutionary time, this apparent divergence in regulation patterns
poses many interesting questions. For example, how prevalent of a divergence is it?
That is, at what taxonomic level does the divergence occur? Do all species of fish lack
HIF-I inducibility of glycolytic enzymes or is the trait specific to the goby family or even
just to G. mirabilis?
It is possible that the severity and/or time course of hypoxia were not sufficient to
trigger HIF-1 mediated gene induction. This seems unlikely for two reasons. First, the
72 hour time course of hypoxic exposure is likely to be considerably longer than any
length of hypoxic exposure that G. mirabilis may experience in its natural setting due to
the tidal cycle. Second, it is obvious based on the results of the P. experiment, the severe
depletion of liver glycogen stores and systemic increase lactate levels (Stonington,
unpublished), and the observation of increased ventilation frequency, that the fish in my
experiment were experiencing considerable hypoxic stress. It would be valuable to
obtain the DNA sequence data for the genes encoding for the glycolytic enzymes assayed
in this study and look for HIF-I specific sequences in the 3' or 5' flanking regions.
