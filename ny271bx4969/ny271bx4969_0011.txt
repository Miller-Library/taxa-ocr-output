The approximately three-fold increase in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
concentrations in both white muscle (7.8 ng/g at 0 hours and 22.2 ng/g at 72 hours) and
liver (11.7 ng/g at 0 hours and 36.7 ng/g at 8 hours) indicates an increased capacity for
glycolytic flux. This may increase the anaerobic catabolism of glucose and help
compensate for the decreased production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. If this is
the case, then it is clear that modulation of pre-existing enzyme stocks is an important
mechanism by which G. mirabilis is able to tolerate hypoxic stress. One advantage to
this strategy is the rapid time scale over which glycolytic flux can be regulated. This
point is illustrated well in the liver where within 8 hours of hypoxic stress there is a three
fold increase in the concentration of F-2,6-BP as well as a massive depletion of glycogen
stores.
Through allosteric activation of PFK by F-2,6-BP over a short time scale, G.
mirabilis can respond rapidly to decreased O2 availabilty without relying on expensive
protein synthetic machinery. This fits well with the environmental conditions that the
mudsucker may face: regular hypoxia on a tidal time scale. It is interesting, then, to
compare what is now known about the strategies employed by G. mirabilis, and those
employed by organsims that experience hypoxic stress under different time scales and
severities. Species of the genus Carassius, to which both the crucian carp and the
common goldfish belong, show a distinctly different strategy. Many of these species live
in fresh water ponds that may completely freeze over during the winter months. Like the
longjawed mudsucker, these fish will burrow into the mud. However, the ponds in which
they live rapidly become anoxic, and the carp or goldfish will face several months
without O2. When goldfish are exposed to anoxia there is a tissue-specific response: F-
