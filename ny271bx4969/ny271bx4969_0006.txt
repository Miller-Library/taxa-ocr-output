approximately O.3mg/L less the Pe. Experimental treatments included 0, 8, 24, and 72
hours of hypoxia. For each treatment 7 fish were placed in a Tupper-ware container
punctured multiple times to allow adequate water flow. Tupper ware containment
minimized the amount of flight response upon sacrificing the fish, thereby maintaining
glycogen stores in muscle tissues. At each of the later two time points, there was a single
mortality and thus only six fish were assayed from these treatments. At the designated
time points, fish were killed by freeze-clamping in liquid nitrogen. Frozen specimens
were weighed and then stored at -70°C until assays were performed.
Enzyme Assays:
l assayed white muscle and liver tissue from Gillichthys mirabilis for the activity
of 5 glycolytic enzymes: enolase (ENO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH
phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), hexokinase (HK; assayed in liver only), and pyruvate
kinase (PyK). All assays were run on the SpectraMax 340pc 96-well plate reader using
the Softmax Pro version 2.6.1 software (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Ca.), following
established protocols (7). Each sample was assayed in triplicate, for each enzyme. A
substrate-free assay was run for each triplicate set, to control for background pyridine
nucleotide oxidation/ reduction in the homogenate. All assays were performed at 25°C.
Reaction mixtures for each assay were as follows:
Enolase: 8 mM MgCl», 7.2 mM glucose, 0.72 mM ADP, 0.32 mM NADH, 1.75 U/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.5
U/ml LDH, 24.8 U/ml hexokinase, 5 mM 2-phosphoglycerate, 0.49 mM KCl, 48.8 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Lactate Dehydrogenase: 0.64 mM NADH, 1.31mM pyruvate, 0.6 mM KCl, 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Phosphofructokinase: 8 mM MgCl, 0.8 mM KCN, 2 mM ATP, 2.08 mM AMP, 0.32 mM NADH,
3.7U/ml aldolase, 66 U/ml triose phophate isomerase, 10.4 U/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, 8 mM fructose-6-phosphate, 0.43 mM KCl, 42.6 mM Hepes, pH 8.4.
