Figure Legends:
Figure 1: Critical Oxygen tensions for Gillichthys mirabilis at 16Â°C. The inverse of rate
of O2 consumption is plotted against O2 concentration in the aquarium. The rate of O,
consumption was calculated by measuring the amount of time it took each fish to extract
0.1 mg/L of O2 from the aquarium. Note that while the rates change with the size of each
fish, the Pe value does not.
Figure 2: Activities of enolase and lactate dehydrogenase from white muscle tissue. All
values were normalized to protein concentration (mg/ml) in the homogenates assayed.
Figure 3: Activities of phosphoglucoisomerase and pyruvate kinase from white muscle
tissue. All values were normalized to protein concentration (mg/ml) in the homogenates
assayed.
Figure 4: Activities of hexokinase and phosphoglucoisomerase from liver tissue. All
values were normalized to protein concentration (mg/ml) in the homogenates assayed.
Figure 5: Activities of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and enolase, from liver
tissue. All values were normalized to protein concentration (mg/ml) in the homogenates
assayed.
Figure 6: Mean concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in liver and white muscle
tissues. Note the statistically significant change in liver concentrations between O and 8
hours of hypoxia (p = 0.018) and in white muscle concentrations between O and 72 hours
of hypoxia (p = 0.017).
