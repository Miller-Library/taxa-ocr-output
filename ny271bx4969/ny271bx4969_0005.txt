glycolytic enzyme activity. Both tissues were also assayed for the concentration of F-
2,6-BP.
Materials and Methods:
Animals:
Gillichthys mirabilis were collected from University of California, Santa Barbara
lagoon in Santa Barbara, CA in early March, 1999. Fish were held in glass aquaria and
acclimated to Monterey Bay seawater (temperatures 13°-14° C) for at least four weeks.
The fish were fed every other day with a commercial diet (Bioproducts Inc., Warrenton,
Or.).
Critical oxygen tension:
To determine the critical oxygen tension (Pe) for G. mirabilis, a single fish was
placed in a sealed chamber and oxygen concentration in the water was monitored with the
OxyGuard probe (Point Four Systems Inc., Port Moody, B.C. Canada). We determined
the P. to be the concentration of O2 at which a sharp decrease in the rate of O2
consumption by the fish was observed.
Hypoxia Time Course:
I subjected G. mirabilis to hypoxic conditions by placing them in a custom
designed aquarium in which the O2 content can be controlled. Hypoxic conditions were
maintained through a simple feed-back mechanism: a rise in [O21 above a set point value
(as monitored by the OxyGuard probe) would cause a solenoid valve on a N2 tank to
open. The Nz gas was shunted through the aquarium in-flow, thereby stripping the O2
from the water. This system maintained O2 concentrations at a set point (+O.1 mg/L). I
defined 0.8 +0.1 mg/L to be hypoxic, because these O concentrations were
