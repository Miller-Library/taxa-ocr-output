2,6-BP levels dropped in liver, gill, and spleen, wheras F-2,6-BP levels increased in the
brain and heart (9). The use of ethanol by species in this genus also allows for a long
term reliance on glycolysis with out acidotic side effects. It appears that G. mirabilis and
goldfish employ opposite strategies in the liver. While goldfish must ensure that the
brain will have an adequate supply of glucose throughout the whole winter, G. mirabilis
will get a fresh supply of oxygen with the next incoming tide and thus need not conserve
glycogen stores as strongly.
It is also interesting to note the differences between G. mirabilis and mammalian
cells lines in their responses to hypoxic stress. Whereas mammalian cell lines
coordinately up-regulate the glycolytic pathway, there is no change in enzyme
concentrations in the mudsucker. Most mammalian systems do not face significant
hypoxia except under unusual crises (a notable exception is the diving mammals). Thus,
mammalian cells are not geared towards dealing with hypoxia whereas, it seems likely
that G. mirabilis has a high glycolytic capacity for dealing with regular hypoxic stress.
In conclusion, it seems that the strategies an organism uses to tolerate or defend
hypoxic insults are dependent on the severity and time scale that the organism
experiences during its natural life history. G. mirabilis may be particularly well suited
for short-term regularly occurring hypoxia, whereas Carassius species are suited for long
term anoxia. The findings on enzyme activities also provide a cautionary note to
researchers about making assumptions that mechansims of mediating environmental
stress may be conserved across taxonomic groups such as teleosts and mammals.
Further work that would help elucidate the mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in G.
mirabilis include assaying heart and brain tissues for enzyme activities and F-2,6-BP
