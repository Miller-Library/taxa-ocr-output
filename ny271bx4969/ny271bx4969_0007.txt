Phosphoglucoisomerase: 0.8 mM NADP, 14 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 4 mM fructose-6-
phosphate, 83 mM KCl, 82.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Pyruvate Kinase: 8 mM MgCl, 2 mM ADP, 0.32 mM NADH, 11 U/mI LDH, 1.5 mM
phosphoenolpyruvate, 7.2 mM KCl, 71.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.
Each enzyme assay was linked to the oxidation or reduction of a pyridine
nucleotide cofactor, either NADH or NADP+ Enzymatic rates were determined based
on change in absorbance of the pyridine nucleotide molecule at 340 nm. Net initial
reaction rates are reported (averaged triplicates - control). Any linking enzymes
necessary for cofactor coupling were added in excess to ensure that the rate determining
step of the reaction was the enzyme in question.
Since path lengths are unknown for kinetic assays in the 96-well plate reader,
conventional International units (micromoles of substrate converted per unit time) cannot
be determined. Instead, initial reaction rates are reported as time averaged milliÂ¬
Aborbance (in Opitical Density Units) /min. All rates are normalized to protein
concentration in homogenates, as determined by Coomassie Protein Assay (Pierce,
Rockford, II.) using BSA as a standard.
Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate:
Tassayed white muscle, liver, brain, and heart, for concentrations of fructose-2,6,-
bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP). The standard protocol for the F-2,6-BP assay, which measures
the stimulatory effect of tissue extract on potato tuber pyrophosphate-dependent
phosphofructokinase (Bergmeyer, 1984), was modified for the microplate reader by
