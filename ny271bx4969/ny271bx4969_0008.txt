reducing all volumes by a factor of 10 to the final volume of 100 ul. The final reaction
mixture was:
Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate: 2 mMMg, 1 mM fructose-6-phosphate, 0.15 mM NADH, 0.01U/ml potato
tuber pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase, 3.7 U/ml aldolase, 66 U/ml triose phosphate
isomerase, 10.4 U/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mM pyrophosphate, 50 mM Tris, pH
8.0. Samples or standards were all diluted such that the concentration was 510° MF-2,6-BP.
Raw data were analyzed and graphed on SigmaPlot for Windows version 5.0,
except for the P. data which were graphed on Microsoft Excel 97. Students t-test was
used to determine statistical significance in pair-wise comparisons between hypoxia
stressed fish and the control group.
Results:
The rate of oxygen consumption from aquarium water in three different fish
precipitously drops around 1.1 mg/L (Fig. 1). I have designated this value as the Pe. I
also observed that gill ventilation increased from zero visible ventilations to between 80-
120 ventilations per minute (data not shown) when the concentration of oxygen fell
below the P. value of 1.1 mg/L. Each of the three fish tested were of different weight,
indicating that the critical oxygen tension is not a function of size. The rate of oxygen
consumption does seem to vary with size class, although the statistical significance of
these variations was not tested in this study.
After 8 hours of hypoxia, ENO, PGI, PyK, and LDH from white muscle (Fig. 2
and 3) showed no statistically significant change (p» 0.05). Enzyme activities in liver
also did not vary: HK, ENO, PGI, PyK, and LDH showed no statistically significant
trends in 72 hours of hyoxia (Fig. 4 and 5). The lack of change in enzymatic activity
indicates a stable concentration of enzymes assayed.
