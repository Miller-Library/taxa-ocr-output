Figure 6 shows the concentration of F-2,6-BP in liver and white muscle over the
hypoxia time course. There was a significant increase in liver F-2,6-BP levels by 8 hours
of hypoxic stress (p = 0.018, 0 hours: mean = 0.2336, S.D.= 0.621; 8 hours: mean -
0.7333, S.D. =0.2491). After 8 hours of hypoxia, the [F-2,6-BP in the liver did not
change statistically. In white muscle, neither the 8 nor the 24 hour time point showed a
statistically significant change, although there is a general upward trend. There was,
however, a significant increase by 72 hours of exposure (p = 0.017, 0 hours: mean -
0.3913, S.D.=0.4445; 72 hours: mean = 1.1094, S.D. = 0.4106).
Discussion:
The critical oxygen tension of a species can be a good indicator of the type of
oxygen environment in which that organism evolved. The P. value of 1.1 mg/L is in
agreement with previously measured P. values in G. mirabilis (1). Furthermore, the Pe
of G. mirabilis is comparable to the P. of Sebastolobus alascanus (Scorpaenidae,
Teleosti), a benthic species that resides at depths within the oxygen minimum zone
where O2 can be less than 0.3ml/L (8). Thus, it seems likely that G. mirabilis has
developed physiological traits specific for tolerance of low oxygen conditions.
One such hypoxia tolerance trait in G. mirabilis may be a constitutively high
anaerboic capacity via the glycolytic pathway. Support for this hypothesis can be found
in the lack of change in glycolytic enzyme activities in white muscle or liver of G.
mirabilis when it is exposed to hypoxia. Since all the enzyme assays were run with
saturating substrate concentrations, it is likely that no change in reaction rates occurs
because there was no change in enzyme concentrations (for a brief discussion of the
Michaelis-Menten kinetics that allow this inference see Pierce and Crawford, 1994).
