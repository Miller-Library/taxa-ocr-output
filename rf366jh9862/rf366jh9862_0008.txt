Hatching
To test for differences in initial shell morphology distribution, I collected six sets
of egg cases from four different egg clusters from both the exposed and the protected site
and kept them in tea strainers. Only the egg cases from the exposed site hatched so 20
whelks from each of the four exposed containers were transferred to four new tea
strainers and placed in containers with flowing seawater. The baby whelks were fed the
smallest available mussel recruits (M. trossulus); mussels were increased in size as the
snails grew. Snails maintained in this fashion were held for 27 days, at which time their
morphology was assessed.
Results
Morphology
There was a larger fraction of ridged shells at the protected site than at the
exposed site (Figure 2).
Drag
The drag coefficients for smooth and ridged snails were not statistically different
(two-tailed test, t=7.9, pÂ» 0.05). At a wind speed of 36.4 m/s (equivalent to a water
velocity of 3.2 m/s), the average drag coefficient for smooth snails was 0.630 with a
standard error of 0.009. The average drag for ridged was 0.648 with a standard error of
0.019.
Adhesive Force
The difference in adhesive force between ridged and smooth snails was not
significantly different. Statistical significance was determined by conducting an
