transducer was held flush with the wall of the tunnel to simulate the orientation of the
snail in surf-zone flow. The drag imposed by wind was transduced to a voltage and
recorded using a voltmeter. The direction of greatest drag was determined, and force
readings were taken at five different wind speeds: 21.4 m/s, 28.9 m/s, 36.4 m/s, 43.9 m/s
and 51.3 m/s. Profile area for each snail was determined by taking a digital picture of the
snail next to an object of a known surface area. The object and the snail were cut out of
the paper print-out and weighed. Profile area was determined using the ratio of paper
weight to area. With this information in hand, the drag coefficient could be determined
for each shell.
Drag Coefficient =
(2 *Drag Force)
(Air density* Profile Area* (Velocity/2))
A two-tailed t test at a wind speed of 36.4 was used to determine whether a significant
difference existed between the average drag coefficients of the two morphologies.
Adhesive Force
The adhesive force of N. emarginata was compared between the exposed and the
protected sites by pulling off approximately 40 whelks at each site. Whelks were pulled
off in the direction of greatest drag. Two different force meters were used to record
adhesive force, one with a 500 g rating for whelks below 14 mm long, the other with a 5
kg rating for bigger whelks. A string was attached to the force meter with a loop and the
other end was secured with a noose around the whelk's shell. The meter was then used to
