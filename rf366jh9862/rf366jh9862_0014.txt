Acknowledgments
This project owes a lot to the help of my advisors Mark Denny, Eric Sanford and Jim
Watanabe. I would like to thank Mark Denny for always listening to and answering my
numerous questions, as well as his creative ideas for how I was actually going to test all
my hypotheses. Thanks to Eric Sanford for all his time and help with my experimental
set-ups and ideas, from catching crabs to interpreting results. Thanks to Jim Watanabe
for all his statistics help, as well as thoughtful suggestions along the way. I would also
like to thank Carrie Kappel for always volunteering her time. I would also like to thank
my Dad for helping me collect over 200 snails on his vacation.
