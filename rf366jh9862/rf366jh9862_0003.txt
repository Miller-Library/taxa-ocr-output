shell sculpture can be a genetic trait, the possibility of predator induced phenotypic
plasticity remains to be answered for N. emarginata.
At China Point in Monterey Bay, California, two shell morphologies of Nucella
emarginata exist. A ridged morphology has raised axial ridges on the shell, while a
smooth morphology lacks these ridges and has a smooth outer shell. Preliminary
observations suggested that these two morphologies were unevenly distributed between
wave exposed and wave protected sites at China Point. More ridged snails were observed
in wave protected sites, and more smooth snails were observed in wave exposed sites.
In this study, I examined several factors that could be influencing the different
distributions of N. emarginata morphologies. Wave impact could be dictating these
different distributions by ripping off one morphology with greater drag. Wave impact
could also be affecting the predators of the snails. The main predators of N. emarginata
at China point are the crab Cancer antennarius and the Pisaster ochraceus, particularly
at the wave exposed site. Power supplied by breaking waves has been shown to protect
intertidal residents by knocking away their enemies or preventing them from feeding
(Leigh et al. 1987). Crab predation at the exposed site could be similarly affected because
in more wave exposed sites crab have a harder time locomoting and therefore feeding.
Differences in the crushing forces tolerated by ridged and smooth snails could be
dictating a preference in crab predation and therefore affecting the distributions seen at
each site. Initial distributions at hatching must also be determined before we can
accurately gauge the affect of either wave impact or predation.
