this is under genetic control, natural selection may favor smooth shells, and they could
become more prevalent unless there are other advantages to having a ridged shell.
Conclusion
The direct impact of environment on the snail is not a major factor in the
distribution of their shell morphology. In contrast, while different distributions of ridged
and smooth Nucella emarginata were not explained completely, wave impact on
predators of these snails seems to be very plausible explanation. To further explain why
different morphologies of N. emarginata were seen in different numbers at these two
sites, initial distributions would have to be determined. That information could clarify
some of the inconsistencies in this experiment as well as the literature as to whether shell
sculpture is exclusively genetic, or also a plastic trait.
