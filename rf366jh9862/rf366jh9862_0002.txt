Introduction
An important issue in ecology is understanding how different genetic and
environmental factors dictate differences in the morphology of individuals within a
species. In turn it is important to see whether or not different morphologies lead to
greater or decreased individual fitness. Natural selection may act on genetically based
morphological variation to produce evolutionary change. Environmentally induced
phenotypic changes may have important effects at the population level.
Shell morphology is used as a rather broad term in the literature referring to
everything from architecture of the actual shell to differences in aperture width and
length. Morphological differences in the shell are often described as shell sculpture.
Differences in shell sculpture have been shown to protect against certain predators in
marine snails (e.g. Vermeij 1993). Differences in shell sculpture in bivalves has been
show to reduce drag in burrowing (e.g. Vermeij 1993). Clearly, morphological (and
specific sculptural) differences have the potential to affect fitness.
Nucella emarginata is a common predatory whelk found in rocky intertidal areas,
along the California coast. This species has direct development, juvenile snails hatch
from egg capsules attached to rock surfaces in the intertidal zone. Shell sculpture in N.
emarginata has been found to be under genetic control (e.g, Palmer 1984). However,
differences in shell morphology, specifically aperture thickness, have been found within
populations of N. emarginata, aperture thickness being a defense against crab predation
(Geller 1990). Whereas morphology can be genetic, crab presence has also been shown
to produce morphological changes in intertidal snails (e.g. Trussell 1996). Thus, while
