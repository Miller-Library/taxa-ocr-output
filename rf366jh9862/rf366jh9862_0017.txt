Experimental set- up for crab predation and crab influence on snails.
Predator preference for snail morphologies was assessed in the large
containers, whereas effects of crabs on whelks was quantified in smaller
containers with water flowing from the tubs. See text for details.
Distribution of ridged and smooth morphologies of Nucella emarginata in
samples taken at the wave exposed (n-62) and wave protected (n-62)
areas. Black represents the ridged morphology while striped represents
the smooth.
The difference in the average adhesion between snails from the wave
exposed and the wave protected areas. Exposed whelks had a greater
adhesion force on average.
Predation on tethered Nucella after-1, 3 and 6 days attached in the low
intertidal zone. Days 1-3 had wavy conditions and days 4-6 were calm.
Black represents snails transplanted from the wave exposed area to the
waye protected area while striped represents snails transplanted from the
waye protected area to the wave exposed area.
Differences in drilling rates between snails under crab influence and
control snails. Black represents snails from the wave exposed site and
stripes represent snails from the wave protected site. Crab-exposed snails
fed significantly less than control snails.
