In this study the most significant factor found to affect the difference in
distribution was wave impact on predators. Whether distributions were the same at
hatching as at later in life was indeterminate in the time allotted for the study.
Methods & Materials
Morphology
Two distinct shell morphologies of Nucella emarginata were examined: smooth
and ridged. Ridged morphologies have raised axial ridges of varying degrees. Smooth
morphologies have smooth shells lacking any such ridges. While some intermediate
morphologies were found, I focused my study on N. emarginata with distinct
morphologies. N. emarginata's shell morphology was compared in sites with differing
wave impact. A wave-exposed site was selected in Monterey Bay at the western edge of
China Point, and a protected site at Fisher beach, near the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I
quantified the difference in shell morphology at these sites by choosing at each site a 2 m
by 1 m rock area with a great concentration of N. emarginata, and counting the number
of each shell morphology present in that area.
Drag
To assess the potential impact of waves, the drag coefficient was measured for
each morphology. To this end, I collected five ridged-morphology N. emarginata from
the protected site and five smooth from the exposed site. These whelks were boiled and
their soft bodies removed. Each snail was then glued with five-minute epoxy to the
plastic plate of a drag transducer and placed in a high-speed wind tunnel. The plate of the
