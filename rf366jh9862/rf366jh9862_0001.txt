Abstract
Different distributions of ridged and smooth morphologies of Nucella emarginata
are found at wave-exposed and protected sites at China Point in Monterey Bay. A greater
number of the ridged morphology was found at the protected site and the smooth at the
exposed. Variation in drag coefficients, adhesive force, and crushing force between shell
morphologies do not appear to dictate this difference in distribution, although adhesive
force is marginally greater in wave exposed whelks. Predation on tethered whelks is
greater in the ridged morphology in general than the smooth. However, whelks were
eaten more quickly at the protected site, suggesting that wave action's effect on predators
may play a role in the distribution of the two morphologies. In a laboratory experiment,
crabs showed no preference between ridged or smooth N. emarginata, with a slight
preference for exposed whelks. Ã„fter 27 days of growth, it was unclear whether
differences in shell morphology were present among juveniles hatched from the exposed
site.
