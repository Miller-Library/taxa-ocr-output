tug on the snail, and the dislodgment force was recorded. For whelks that were too small,
or oriented in a position making it difficult to use the noose technique, the string was
glued to the whelk's shell using cyanoacrylate adhesive. N. emarginata that were
accessible and feeding on acorn barnacles were selected for these tests because whelks
tend to hold on with greatest force while feeding.
Crushing Force
The force to crush shells (a simulation of predation by crabs) was measured on
twenty whelks, ten from each site and five of each morphology. Crushing was
standardized to larger crab predation, which involves crushing of the shell with one claw,
as opposed to smaller crabs that peel away at the aperture lip of the snail (Bertness and
Cunningham 1981). One jaw of a pair of pliers was held steady by a vise and the snail
was placed between this stationary jaw and the movable jaw. A 5 kg force meter was
then used to forcibly close the pliers until the aperture was crushed, and the crushing
force was recorded. Each whelk was grasped in the same orientation and the meter was
placed at approximately the same spot to avoid complications due to a variable lever arm.
Tethering
To examine predation at each site, twenty whelks, ten of each morphology, were
transplanted from protected to exposed sites and vice versa. Fishing snap swivels were
glued with epoxy to the whelk's shells and were attached with fishing line to bolts in the
lower intertidal zone, just below the whelk's normal vertical distribution. Two snails of
