Crab Predation
In the laboratory experiment, crabs showed no preference for either ridged or
smooth snails. Crabs chose to eat exposed snails first 4 out of 6 times (p = 0.23), but
showed no further consistent preference for exposed or protected snails. No increase in
the thickness of the aperture lip was seen in either crab-exposed snails or control snails.
A significant difference (ANOVA, F=15.14, p-0.008) was seen in drilling rates between
control snails and those under crab influence with crab f3 excluded (Table 1). This crab
was unable to feed on whelks because it had lost half a claw. Whelks exposed to water
flow from a tank of actively feeding crabs ate the least amount of mussels; twelve of
these whelks didnâ€™t feed at all (Figure 5).
Hatching
In the 27 days of this experiment, the hatched N. emarginata had not grown
enough to distinguish between ridged or smooth morphologies. The whelks grew from 1
mm at time of hatching to 3 mm after 27 days. They also developed banding of
coloration, and some initial signs of ridges or architecture, however if was impossible to
discern different morphologies because all appeared the same.
Discussion
Wave impact on different shell morphologies of Nucella emarginata does not
seem to dictate their ability to live in wave exposed or wave protected conditions. The
drag coefficient is not significantly different, so the drag on the two different
morphologies of the same size snail is approximately the same. Therefore, the greater
abundance of smooth snails at the wave exposed site cannot be explained by lessened
