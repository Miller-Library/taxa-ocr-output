each morphology were tethered to each bolt at approximately the same level in the
intertidal zone. Snails were checked 1,3 and 6 days after tethering.
Crab Predation and Influence
To analyze predation in the lab as well as to test for an effect of crab presence on
shell growth, three crabs (Cancer antennarius approx. carapace width 5-8 cm) were
collected and placed in Tupperware*â€œ containers (25*25 cm) with mesh cutouts to allow
water flow. These Tupperware"M containers were then weighted with rocks and placed
into a larger dish tub with water flowing in. Three control tubs were also set up in
random order along the line of water flow. Eight whelks of similar length were placed in
each of the crab and no-crab containers, four whelks from each site (two of each
morphology), marked for their site of origin. Influence of crab effluent on whelks was
determined in smaller 1-liter containers (Figure 1). Water was siphoned into these
containers with plastic tubing from the larger tubs containing either a crab or no crab.
Two containers with whelks from protected and exposed sites were set up for each larger
tub. Four whelks of similar size (shell lengths - approx. 16 mm- 18 mm) were placed in
each smaller container and individually labeled with nail polish. Initial and final readings
were taken of length and width of the aperture at approximately the same position on the
shell. Two notches were filed into the outer lip of the body whorl of each whelk to
determine whether growth had occurred. Whelks were fed bay mussels (Mytilus
trossulus) of approximately the same (shell length = approx. 20 mm to 22 mm).
