ANCOVA with site as the variant and whelk shell length as a covariant. Although there
was no difference between morphologies (ANCOVA, F= 0.218, p =.642), a significant
difference in adhesive force was found between snails at the two sites (ANCOVA, F =
7.698, p = 0.007) (Figure 3). The protected snails averaged 3.30 N while the exposed
snails averaged 4.71 N.
Crushing Force
No significant difference in crushing force was found between the two
morphologies, or between the two sites (ANCOVA, F = 1.013, p = 0.330). Average
crushing force for exposed snails was 23.72 N (Standard Error, SE-4.43). Average
crushing force for protected snails was 21.22 N (SE- 2.01). For ridged shells, the
average crushing force was 22.94 N (SE-3.54), and average crushing force for smooth
shells was 22.23 N (SE-3.60).
Tethering
A greater number of ridged snails were eaten at both the protected and the
exposed sites, as seen in Figure 4. Over the 6 days of the experiment wave intensity
varied, with larger waves on days 1-3 and low wave intensity on days 4-6. Exposed
whelks were eaten at a greater rate during calmer wave activity, while protected snails
were eaten at a relatively steady rate. Two predators, crabs and Pisaster, fed on exposed
snails, while the protected snails had evidence only of crab predation. Fragments of shell
attached to line suggested crab predation, whereas empty shells attached to line suggested
Pisaster.
