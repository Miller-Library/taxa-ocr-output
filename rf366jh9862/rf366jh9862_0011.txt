drag on the smooth morphology. The adhesive force between the two morphologies does
not differ as would be expected if this force were a selective factor. However, the
average adhesive force of the wave exposed N. emarginata gives them a greater ability to
adhere in conditions of greater wave impact. This difference could be related to
differences in foot size (Trussell 1997).
Although wave impact on the snail itself cannot explain the different distributions
of morphologies, its effect on predation appears to be a viable explanation. The crushing
force of shells did not vary between the two sites, nor did it vary between morphologies.
Therefore, the ability of the crab to crush shells is unlikely to dictate a preference by this
predator. In the laboratory the crabs did not significantly favor snails of a particular
morphology or those from a particular site, suggesting that crabs at China Point would
not eat more of one type of N. emarginata. However, the tethering experiment yielded
different results.
The tethering experiment was conducted over a period of 6 days, the first three of
which were wavy, and the last three of which were extremely calm. During the first three
days, only one snail was eaten at the exposed site while eight were eaten at the protected
site. These wavy days may have made it difficult for crab predators to prey upon the
tethered snails at the exposed site. In contrast, on the calm days 8 more snails were eaten
at the exposed site, while feeding rates stayed approximately the same at the protected
site. The calm conditions may have allowed crab predators greater access to snail prey at
the exposed site. Bigger waves and greater wave impacts at the exposed site limit crab
mobility in the intertidal zone (Leigh et al. 1987). This suggests that the intensity of crab
predation may be dictated by wave conditions.
