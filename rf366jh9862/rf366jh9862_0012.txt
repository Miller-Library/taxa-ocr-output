The contradictory results to the above experiments lay in the preference for ridged
snails at the exposed site; many more ridged snails than smooth snails were eaten. At the
exposed site eight out of the nine snails eaten were ridged. This could be due to
unforeseen differences between predation in a laboratory experiment as opposed to
predation in the field. Ridged snails may be easier for crabs to grasp than smooth snails.
This could explain the greater abundance of smooth snails at the exposed site. However,
a preference for ridged snails was also observed at the protected site, leaving
uncertainties as to the factors dictating distributions of different morphologies there.
While it is therefore probable that crab predation plays a key role in the different
distribution of ridged and smooth N. emarginata, this factor cannot explain all
distribution results.
Plastic response to crab presence was indeterminate in these experiments due to
the lack of feeding by many of the snails under crab influence. No similar trend was seen
in the control snails, suggesting that crab presence causes decreased feeding rate in snails.
The snails in the presence of the crab with half a claw had similar feeding rates to control
snails, suggesting that crabs must be actively feeding on snails to have an affect. This
experiment would have to be run for a longer period to see if snails add thicker shell in
response to crabs despite lack of feeding. Crab effluent has been shown to cause snails to
grow thicker shells in Littorina obtusa (Trussell 1996).
The next step is to determine, by hatching and raising N. emarginata, if the
underlying assumption of equal distribution for each population holds. If distributions at
hatching are determined, crab predation could be shown to play a significant role.
Results in the field suggest that there may be an advantage to having a smooth shell. It
