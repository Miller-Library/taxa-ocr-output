phosphate dehydrogenase release in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs?

Abstract
The activity of the pentose phosphate shunt increases soon after fertilization of
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs, and this increase is correlated with a change in the
intracellular distribution of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and
rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose shunt. This enzyme is found in a bound, inactive
state in unfertilized eggs and in a soluble, active state in newly fertilized zygotes. The
signaling pathway that links fertilization to the release of G6PD from the bound state is
not known. In this study, I have investigated whether tyrosine kinase activity is
involved in fertilization-induced G6PD release in sea urchin eggs.
I determined that G6PD release does not occur in unfertilized eggs treated with
bindin or antibody against the sperm receptor. These two treatments activate the
specific tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the sperm receptor. I also found that
inhibition of general tyrosine kinase activity using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors
genistein and tyrphostin 51 does not block G6PD release in sea urchin zygotes. As
deduced by immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosines, genistein is inhibiting tyrosine
kinase activity while tyrphostin 51 is not. These preliminary data show that those
tyrosine kinases which are inhibited by genistein are not involved with G6PD release
after fertilization. I also discuss the possible reasons why tyrphostin 51, bindin, and
anti-receptor antibody treatment may have given inconclusive data.
