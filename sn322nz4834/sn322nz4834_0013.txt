treating eggs with bindin and anti-receptor antibodies to see if a G6PD release-response
would be elicited due to the activation of this tyrosine kinase.
According to my results, bindin is not causing G6PD release, however this
conclusion may be particular to these experiments. Because bindin did not prevent
sperm from fertilizing the eggs, there may not have been enough bindin to interact with
its receptor. One way to ascertain whether bindin is interacting with the receptor would
be to determine whether bindin-treatment is causing the receptor phosphorylation as
described by Abassi and Foltz (1994).
Similarly, the anti-receptor antibody treatments show no effect on G6PD release.
However, in this case, the antibody-antigen interaction may be disrupted by the high
ion content of sea water. That the eggs were not fluorescing when treated with
fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies supports the idea that the antibody
did not successfully bind the receptor. Previously, experiments done with these
antibodies have been on in vitro membrane preparations and the jonic strength of
solutions has been kept low (Abassi and Foltz, 1994). Binding of the antibody to live
eggs can be enhanced by incubating the eggs in a solution that is isotonic to sea water.
but has a low ionic strength. The osmolarity of this solution can be maintained by
adding non-ionic compounds such as sucrose instead of ions. The effect of the anti
receptor antibody treatments on G6PD release must be studied further by first
ascertaining that these antibodies are, in fact, binding to the sperm receptor.
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
Genistein and tyrphostin are both general tyrosine kinase inhibitors which
prevent fertilization-induced tyrosine kinase activity in sea urchin eggs (Moore and
Kinsey, 1995). In an effort to determine if general tyrosine kinase inhibition would
block fertilization-induced G6PD release, I studied the effects of treating eggs with
genistein and tyrphostin 51.
