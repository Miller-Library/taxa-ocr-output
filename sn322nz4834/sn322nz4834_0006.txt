NADPH Assay
The amount of NADPH produced by the egg in vivo was studied as described by
Epel (1964). 1 put 3 ml of 1% egg suspension into a cuvette and measured NADPH
production by monitoring light emission at 460 nm when the cell suspension was
excited at 365 nm. The cells were maintained in suspension with a stirrer, and the eggs
were kept at 20째C throughout measurements. I added 1 ul of undiluted sperm to the
egg suspension while it was in the fluorimeter to asses NADPH changes due to
fertilization.
Bindin
A purified S. purpuratus bindin sample was obtained from K. Foltz at UCB. The
bindin sample was kept at -80째C until needed. Prior to use, I thawed the sample at 4째C
for three days, and then spun it for 30 minutes at 10,000 rpm (12,000 g) in an SS34 rotor
at 4째C. The supernatant contained the soluble bindin whose concentration was
determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) assay. (Smith et al., 1985). Based upon
those protein concentrations, I incubated unfertilized eggs in 0.06-60.0 ng/ ml of soluble
bindin. Ttook samples for the G6PD assay 4-5 minutes after treatment with bindin.
Antibodies Against the Sperm Receptor
Purified anti-receptor antibodies were also obtained from K. Foltz. The anti-exo
antibody was made to the extracellular region of the receptor, and the anti-cyto
antibody was made to the cytoplasmic region of the receptor. I used the anti-exo
antibody as the experimental primary antibody at a concentration of 6 ug/ml, and for
the controls lused goat immunoglobulins (Sigma) or anti-cyto antibodies as primary
antibodies, also at 6 ug/ml. Unfertilized eggs were incubated with primary antibody
