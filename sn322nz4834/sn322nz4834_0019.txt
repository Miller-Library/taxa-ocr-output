TABLE 1
Effects of Bindin and Anti-Bindin Receptor Antibodies on G6PD Release in
Unfertilized S. purpuratus Eggs
(Data expressed as percentage of bound G6PD)
Control
Bindin 60 ng/ml
Bindin 60 pg/ml
Experiment 1
52.0

Control
Anti-Exo IgG
Control IgG
Experiment 2

Experiment 3
68.5
66.3
56.2
Note: Unfertilized eggs were treated with either 60 ng/ ml or 60 pg/ ml soluble bindin
in experiment 1. Anti-exo receptor IgG antibodies were used in both experiments 2 and
3. The control IgG for experiment 2 was goat immunoglobulins, and the control IgG for
experiment 3 was anti-cyto receptor IgG antibody. In all experiments, G6PD bound
after fertilization of controls was less than or equal to 10%. Each value in the table was
calculated from the mean of two assays on each sample.
