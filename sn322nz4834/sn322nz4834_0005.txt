Typically, the eggs were fertilized by diluting dry sperm 1:100 in FSW and then
again 1:100 into the egg suspension for a total dilution of 1:10,000.
G6PD Assay
The amount of G6PD bound to the particulate fraction was determined as
described by Swezey and Epel (1986). I hand centrifuged 1 ml of egg or zygote
suspension, resuspended it to 1 ml in ice-cold 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic
acid (pH 6.5 at 4°0), 6 mM EGTA, and 20 mM KC, and homogenized it using an
average of 12-20 strokes of a tight-fitting dounce homogenizer. Homogenate was then
spun for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf centrifuge (-12,000 g), and the supernatant (S1) was
removed and stored at 4°C. I resuspended the pellet in ice-cold 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0 at
4°C) containing 0.1 MKCI (KC buffer) with a volume equaling S1. The high ionic
strength of the KCl buffer caused the G6PD bound to the particulate fraction to become
soluble. The suspension was then spun again for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf centrifuge
(-12,000 g) and the supernatant (S2) was removed and stored at 4°C.
1determined the G6PD activity of S1 and S2 with a spectrophotometric assay.
The assay contained 35 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM G6P, 0.4 mM NADP,
and 20-50 ul of sample in a total volume of 2 ml. G6PD activity was measured as the
rate of increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to the production of NADPH. One unit of
G6PD is defined as the amount necessary to catalyze the conversion of 1 umol NADP to
NADPH per minute at 20°C.
S1 contained G6PD that was unbound in the egg cells, and S2 contained G6PD
that was released from the particulate fraction. The total amount of G6PD in the
homogenate was the sum of the two, and the percentage of bound G6PD was equal to
the percent of the total activity (activity in S1 + activity in S2) contained in S2. I assayed
each Sl and S2 twice, and calculated percentages using mean values.
1took all fertilized samples 4-5 minutes after fertilization.
