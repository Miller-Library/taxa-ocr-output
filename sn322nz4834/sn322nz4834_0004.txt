tyrosine kinases at their substrate binding sites (Moore and Kinsey, 1995). While
genistein and tyrphostin B42 inhibit overall fertilization-dependent tyrosine kinase
activity, they do not prevent the early events of fertilization including elevation of the
fertilization membrane; however, they do inhibit later events including DNA synthesis,
cell division, and pronuclear migration (Moore and Kinsey, 1995). While these effects
are known, the effects of general tyrosine kinase inhibition on fertilization-induced
G6PD release by genistein and tyrphostin are not known.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a tyrosine kinase is involved
in the increased activity of the pentose shunt at fertilization of sea urchin eggs by
addressing the following questions. (1) Is activity of the specific tyrosine kinase that
phosphorylates the sperm receptor at fertilization involved with G6PD release? (2)
Does inhibition of general tyrosine kinase activity block fertilization-induced G6PD
release?
Materials and Methods
Handling of Gametes
Tinduced the spawning of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus by injecting 1-2 ml of 0.5
MKCl into the coelomic cavity, and collected eggs by placing the females with their oral
sides up onto beakers filled with sea water such that their eggs shed directly into the sea
water. Egg jelly was removed by passing the egg suspension 5-6x through an 80 um
mesh and washing 2-3x with filtered sea water (FSW). To ascertain that this method
actually removed egg jelly, I examined the dejellied eggs with colloidal ink and
toluidine blue stain. The eggs were then resuspended to a 1% suspension, which I
determined using a Bauer-Schenk graduated centrifuge tube, and kept at 16°C. I
collected undiluted sperm by pipetting them directly from the surface of the urchin.
Undiluted sperm were stored at 4°C.
