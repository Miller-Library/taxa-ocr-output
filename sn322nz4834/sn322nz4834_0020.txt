Figure 1: 1% egg suspensions were incubated for 1 hr with 100 uM genistein before
fertilizing and assaying for G6PD activity. Controls were incubated in 0.1% DMSO.
Both unfertilized samples were taken 15 minutes before the fertilized samples. The
graph shows the means of two experiments, and bars represent ranges of these values.
Figure 2: 1% egg suspensions were incubated for 90 minutes with 100 uM tyrphostin 51
before fertilizing and assaying for G6PD activity. Controls were incubated in 0.1%
DMSO. Both unfertilized samples were taken 15 minutes before the fertilized samples.
Data are from one experiment.
Figure 3: Eggs were treated with 100 uM genistein and 100 uM tyrphostin 51 for 90
minutes before fertilization and subsequent sampling for immunoprecipitation.
Unfertilized and fertilized controls were treated with 0.1% DMSO for 90 minutes as
well. All samples were immunoprecipitated using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody
PY-20. Unfertilized control, lane 1. Genistein, lane 2. Tyrphostin 51, lane 3. Fertilized
control, lane 4. An antibody control using no lysate and a control using non-specific
mouse IgG as a primary antibody were also done (lanes 5 and 6 respectively).
