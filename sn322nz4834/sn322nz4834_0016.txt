eggs are germ-line cells. G6PD release in the rat kidney cells occurs through hormone
treatment and requires tyrosine kinase activity, while sea urchin eggs release G6PD at
fertilization. The hormone treatment can occur numerous times in the life of the kidney
cell, whereas fertilization occurs only once in the life of the egg cell. Because of these
differences, the mechanism that releases G6PD may be quite different for these two
types of cells, and tyrosine kinase activity may not be necessary for G6PD release in sea
urchin eggs. If tyrosine kinases are not involved in G6PD release in sea urchin eggs at
fertilization, then the intriguing question is what is the mechanism of this activation.
and how else do the mammalian and urchin mechanisms differ?
