on an orbit shaker for 30 to 60 minutes at 16°C, then washed twice with FSW. Goat anti¬
rabbit IgG conjugated to the fluorescein derivative DTAF at a 1:62 dilution or anti-rabbit
IgG conjugated to the rhodamine-based dye TRITC (Sigma) at a 1:200 dilution were
used as secondary antibodies. I incubated the eggs in secondary antibody for 30
minutes on an orbit shaker at 16°C, then washed them once with FSW and took
samples.
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
1made up 100 mM stock solutions of genistein (ICN) and tyrphostin 51 (Sigma)
in DMSO. Ttreated unfertilized eggs with 100 uM genistein or 100 uM tyrphostin 51 for
up to 90 minutes before fertilization (see Results for incubation times for each
experiment). Controls were treated with 0.1% DMSO for equal amounts of time.
Samples of treated unfertilized eggs were taken 15 minutes before fertilization, and the
zygote samples were taken 4-5 minutes post-fertilization of the remaining eggs.
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was done using a protocol modified from Ciapa and Epel
(1991). I concentrated 40 ml samples of 1% suspension to 5% and treated them with 5
mM aminotriazol (ATA). ATA weakens the fertilization envelopes (FEs) and thus helps
the extraction buffer lyse the eggs. Äfter 5 minutes I fertilized the samples with a 1:2000
dilution of sperm. Thirty seconds after adding sperm, I checked the eggs under a
microscope for FE elevation. Thirty seconds later the zygote suspensions were passed
8x through an 80 um mesh, washed with 10 ml FSW, and twice with 10 ml 1 M glycine,
1mMEGTA, pH 8.0 adjusted with 1 MTris. I then resuspended the final pellet with 3.6
ml (10% suspension) of extraction buffer, made of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM
Nac, 10% glycerol, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgC2, 1% Nonidet-P 40, including 2 mM
