sodium vanadate (ortho), 10 mM Na4P2O7, 10 mM NaF, 10 ug/ ml aprotinin, 10 ug/ml
leupeptin, 10 ug/ml pepstatin, 50 ug/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This suspension was rotated at 4°C for 30 minutes. I
spun the extracts for 10 minutes at 10,000g in an SS34 rotor at 4°C. One ml samples of
supernatant were incubated with 5 ug/ml of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY-20
(ICN) for 4 hours, rotating, at 4°C. I also incubated two controls, one using 5 ug/ ml of
non-specific mouse IgGpp (Sigma) with lysate, and the other using PY-20 with no lysate,
T added 100 ul of a 1:1 dilution of agarose bead-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody
(Sigma) in extraction buffer, and incubated the samples for 1 hour, rotating, at 4°C. The
samples were then washed twice with 1 ml extraction buffer, once with 1 ml 0.5 M LiC.
0.1 MTris (pH7.4), and once with 1 ml 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 minutes in the Eppendorf
centrifuge between each wash. I resuspended the final pellets in 80 ul each of
electrophoresis sample buffer made of 2% SDS, 60 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 100
mM DTT, and a few grains of bromphenol blue, and placed them in an 80-85°C water
bath for 10 minutes. The samples were cooled to room temperature and spun for 5
minutes in the Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatants were removed to new tubes and
frozen at -35°
Tran these samples on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli, 1970), and the
phosphotyrosines were revealed using a Western immunoblot (Towbin et al., 1979). The
blot was blocked for an hour in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 138 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 3%
BSA. Tused PY-20 as the primary antibody in a 1:2000 dilution, incubating for 1 hour,
and goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) HRPO (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) as the
secondary antibody in a 1:2000 dilution, incubating for 1 hour. Before and after each
antibody incubation, I washed the blots 4x 5 minutes with 20 mls of saline solution
made of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.8% Nacl, 0.1% Tween. The blot was developed using
the chemiluminescence assay described by Thorpe et al., (1985).
