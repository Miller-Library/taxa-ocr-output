Effect of Bindin and the Antibody Against the Sperm Receptor on G6PD Release
Tused two different approaches to determine whether the specific tyrosine kinase
that phosphorylates the sperm receptor after fertilization is involved in G6PD release.
The first was by treating unfertilized eggs with two concentrations of bindin: 60 pg/ml.
(used by Abassi and Foltz (1994) to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the sperm
receptor); or 60 ng/ml (1000x as concentrated). Both concentrations of soluble bindin
had little or no effect on G6PD release (Table 1). These eggs fertilized normally, (FE
elevation of close to 100% of the eggs, as in controls) indicating that bindin was not
preventing access of sperm to its receptor. While the BCA protein assay is generally
accurate, there may have been some contaminants which gave an inordinately high
concentration of soluble bindin. In this case, the amount of bindin I used may not have
been enough to stimulate the egg.
The second approach was to treat eggs with anti-receptor antibody. This
treatment also seems to have no effect on G6PD release (Table 1). The secondary
antibodies used in these experiments were conjugated to fluorescent dyes, and because
the eggs did not fluoresce after treatment, it seemed that the primary antibodies were
not binding to the cell surface. The eggs fertilized normally, again indicating that the
receptor remained accessible to sperm. The high ionic strength of sea water may have
been causing a disruption between the antibody-antigen interaction, yielding these
results.
