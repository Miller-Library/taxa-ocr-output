Introduction
The study of fertilization in sea urchin eggs has brought about many insights into
the mechanisms cells can use to change from a dormant state to an active one (Epel,
1990). Currently we know much about the primary events of signal transduction at
fertilization, however we do not know as much about what happens downstream.
The pentose phosphate shunt is an alternative pathway to glycolysis. Through
this pathway, glucose is turned into various biosynthetic products necessary for cell
growth and division including NADPH which is necessary for DNA synthesis. Swezey
and Epel (1995) showed that the shunt is activated shortly after fertilization, however
the mechanism of this activation remains unclear.
The first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose shunt is glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD). Activity of this enzyme is a good indicator of activity of the
entire pentose shunt pathway. G6PD is in an inactive form bound to particulate matter
in the egg before fertilization and in an active, free, soluble form after fertilization
(Swezey and Epel, 1986). While release of G6PD at fertilization does not seem to
involve any covalent changes of the enzyme itself (Swezey and Epel, 1986), its release
may be an important part of egg activation after fertilization.
Another example of cell activation leading to an increase in shunt activity is
growth factor stimulation of mammalian rat kidney cells (Stanton and Seifter, 1988).
Interestingly, in these cells G6PD is in a bound form prior to stimulation by treatment
with growth factors, and treatment causes the rapid release of G6PD (Stanton et al.,
1991). Recently, Tian et al. (1994) discovered that cells transfected with platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) mutants that were tyrosine kinase deficient would not
release G6PD in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), the stimulating
