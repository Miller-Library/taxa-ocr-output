in the distribution of populations over extended periods
of time (Frank, 1965).
In the present study an attempt was made to deter-
mine the orientation and movements of Acmaea digitalis
on vertical rocks at various stages of the tidal cycle.
and to gain some insight into the factors influencing
them.

FIELD STUDIES ON ORIENTATION
An initial field study was carried out to determine
the orientation tendency of Acmaea digitalis on vertical
surfaces at low tide. Acmaea digitalis were observed on
one large vertical rock, and the orientation of 136 lim¬
pets was recorded in terms of the position on a clock
toward which the head of each was pointing. Animals with
their anterior ends straight up were recorded as 12 o'clock,
those with heads straight down at 6 o'clock, etc. The re¬
sults, shown in Figure 1, reveal a clear tendency, at low
tide, to orient with the head downward from 4 to 7 o'clock.
Later observations on other populations, including those
in movement studies, confirm this tendency (Table 1).
Young Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1846) on vertical surfaces
appear to show a similar tendency, though detailed obser-
vations are lacking.
Upon finding an orientation tendency at low tide, the
next step was an investigation of orientation during a
tidal cycle. All the following field observations on or¬
ientation were made on one vertical granite rock face (see
Table 4, rock 1). On this rock surface 152 Acmaea digital-
