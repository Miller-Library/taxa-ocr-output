Results obtained during the day appear in Figure 7;
those obtained at night are shown in Figure 8. Height
of the population boxes (N) shows the total number of
limpets watched in each tidal period; the darkened
area in each box shows a cumulative total of the num-
ber of these limpets which have moved at all at each
successive per
iod during the watch. The triangular
tidal diagrams show only the time and height of the
tidal peak and the points of initial and final splash.
For each tide all limpets were at approximately the
same level, and were subjected to the same conditions
of splash.
