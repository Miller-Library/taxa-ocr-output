At Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, Acmaea
digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833 is abundant on granite rocks
above the Endocladia-Balanus zone (see Glynn, 1965). Pre-
liminary observations showed that these limpets tend to
orient with their heads facing downward on vertical or
nearly vertical rocks during periods of low water. No preÂ¬
vious studies on orientation in Acmaea digitalis have been
found. However, in studies on ciliary currents of Lottia
gigantea Sowerby, 1843 by Abbott (1956), and the ecology
of Acmaea dorsuosa Gould by Abe (1931, both authors found
that the majority of these limpets were oriented head down-
ward at low tide. Studies of the movements of Acmaea
italis, which might help explain this orientating behavior
are lacking. Previous observations of movement in this
species have been related mainly to such matters as homing
(Villee and Groody, 1940; Galbraith, 1965), or to shifts
