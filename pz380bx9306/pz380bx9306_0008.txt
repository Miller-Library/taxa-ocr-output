according to Yonge (1962), and my personal observations,
the ctenidium is flexible enough to be moved from one side
of the mantle cavity to the other, carrying with it fecal
material. This could transfer the fecal material to the
opposite side where it could be washed out if the limpet
were oriented to the left on the rock face. With reference
to Abbott's suggestion about retaining water around the
anterior parts at low tide, it was noticed that when the
first splash covered A. digitalis facing downward on a
dry, vertical surface, most animals raised their shells
posteriorly and extended the mantle for less than a minute,
permitting water running down the rock to flow under the
shell toward the head. This activity occurred on successive
splashes and slowly decreased; then the limpet usually
moved. Animals facing upward on the rock sometimes raised
the fronts of their shells at the first signs of water
run-off, permitting water to run about the head.
Almost nothing is known of the factors acting as
immediate causes of particular responses and behavior
patterns in Acmaea
gitalis. Although limpets clamp
down more tightly on rock surfaces in reaction to light
rom a flashlight at night and to a shadow cast in the
day, the present studies, showing that downward orien-
tation can occur at night as well as during the day,
suggest light is not a primary factor here. Laboratory
experiments involving geotropism have not been carried
out. Hewatt (1940), in tests with Acmaea scabra, found
that geotropism did not seem to be a factor in homing
