Six, do limpets tend to move more rapidly, on the
average, during high tides at night than during high
tides in daylight hours? The average rates of movement
for all of the individual limpets used to obtain data
for Figures 7 and 8 are summarized in Figure 14. The
average rates for day and night differ by only 0.1 mm/min.
In a "t test" applied to these results, t=1.31 with a
probability of .10-.20 that the null hypothesis that
there is no difference between day and night rate of loco¬
motion should be rejected. Therefore, the difference is
not statistically significant. The higest rate encountered

time watch when one limpet moved 13 mm/min during a 5 minute
period. However, raves of locomotion well above average
(i.e., 5-8mm/min) for short poriods on the part of individual
limpets were more commonly observed at night than during the
day.
It was noticed in some watches that a majority of the
population of limpets moving showed a net vertical displace¬

Two hypotheses which might
account for this behavior were proposed: (1) local limpet
populations may show a net upward displacement during HHW,
and a net downward displacement during LHW; (2) the net dis¬
placement of the population upward or downward during a high
tide may differ according to whether it occurs during the day
or night. Sixty A. digitalis on vertical rocks 1,6,7,8,9, and
