MILLER, ALAN C. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University
at Pacific Grove, Calif., USA.) Orientation and movement of the
limpet Acmaea digitalis (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) on vertical
rock surfaces. The Veliger.
â€”-Acmaea
digitalis, at low tide, on dry vertical intertidal rocks tend to
orient with the head pointed downward and to the right (facing
toward 3 to 6 o'clock). When splashed by a rising tide they turn.
either right or left, and move about; no marked orientation
tendency appears. On receding tides activity decreases and limpets
again come to rest and tend to orient toward 3 to 6 o'clock.
Changes in orientation reflect changes in direction of movement.
Percent of animals moving, and average distance moved increase
with increasing duration of the period of wetting. The population
shows a net movement upward during higher high water periods, or
during storms, and downward during lower high water periods; this
tendency is more marked for high tides occurring in daylight than
at night. Some animals display homing behavior. ---Author.
