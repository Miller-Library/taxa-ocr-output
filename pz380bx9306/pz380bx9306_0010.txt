of limpets, collected on nine different watches, are
presented in Figures 7 and 8; data are grouped for each
thirty minute interval for each watch.
The complex relationships between the various var¬
iables shown in Figures 7 and 8 are best considered in
relation to specific questions. These are considered be¬
low, and pertinent data are summarized in Figures 9 th
ough 14.
First, is there a direct relationship between amount
of movement and amount of rotation? A scatter diagram
(Figure 9) of the data presented in Figures 7 and 8 in¬
dicates that there is a general relationship, but the cor¬
relation between movement and rotation is not a strong one.
Second, is there initial movement upward (i.e., move¬
ment in the direction of 10, 11, 12, 1, or 2 o'clock with¬
in the first 30 minutes of motion) by the limpet population
in either day or night? Such an upward movement might help
explain a tendency to rotate upward as movement commences
on a rising tide. In order to supplement the data from
Figures 7 and 8, another similar watch -thogePen

andeed was undertaken on rock 3
(Table 4), except the movements of the population were
recorded for only the first hour of the wetting period
during a LHW and the following HHW. The data from these ob-
servations, presented in Figure 10, show that 50% or more
of the limpets do show an initial upward movement. No sig-
nificant difference between day and night is demonstrated.
