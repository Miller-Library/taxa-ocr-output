SUMMARY
1. At low tide Acmaea digitalis on dry vertical rock sur-
faces remain in place and tend to orient with the head
pointed downward and to the right (facing toward 3 to
6 o'clock).
2. When wetted by a rising tide, many limpets start to move;
they tend to turn upward, either to the right or lef
orientation of the population becomes more random as
movements increase,Movement either up or down on the
rock face may occur.
3. On a receding tide, as splash lessens, limpets on vertÂ¬
ical surfaces show decreased activity and again tend to
orient facing downward and to the right.
4. In general, the longer the period of wetting at high
water, the larger the percentage of the population
which moves, the longer the period of movement, the
greater the amount of body rotation, and the greater
the distance moved by the population.
5. The limpet population tends to move upward on the rocks
at periods of higher high water, and downward at periods
of lower high water. The tendency is more marked for
high water periods occurring during daylight hours.
With rough surf, the limpet population as a whole
moves upward on vertical rock faces, and comes back
down during ensuing periods of calm weather.
6. Approximately 25% of the A. digitalis observed showed
homing behavior.
