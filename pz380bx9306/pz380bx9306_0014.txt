placement. The amount of vertical displacement upward also
tends to be greater during the longer periods of wetting and
lower during the more brief wetting periods. The tendency of
the population to respond as it does, moving up or down
depending on the height of the tide, appears to provide a
mechanism by which the population is maintained at a favor-
able level on the rocks.
Conspicuous upward vertical displacements may occur
during periods of unusually heavy surf. One such instance
occurred on rock 9 (see Table 4) between LHW on Sept. 18 and
71
LHW on Sept. 19; during a storm, 9 of 10 limpets observed
moved up on the rock an average distance of 33cm (range -
4-78cm). These observations are similar to those of Frank
(1965) who found that a population of Acmaea digitalis on
the Oregon coast moved higher on the rocks during the winter
an action apparently related to heavy surf caused by winter
storms. However, in the present case the marked upward move-
ment was observed to occur in less than 24 hours.
Is there any difference in vertical displacement
tendencies during high tides at night as opposed to those
during theday? Pertinent data from the population shown in
Figures 15 and 16 have been summarized in Figure 18. The
tendency to move upward during HHW and downward at LHW is
much more marked when the high water occurs during the day.
The differences in behavior at LHW and HHW would probably
have been more marked had it not been for two circumstances.
First, rough surf occurred during the last two watches in
Figure 16, for both HHW and LHW, causing
