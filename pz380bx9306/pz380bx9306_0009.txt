ability. There is certainly a good correlation between an
increasing exposure to splash and an increase in activity,
the latter resulting in a more random orientation on the
rocks. Likewise, the decline of splash during a receding
tide is correlated with increasing downward orientation.

FIELD STUDIES ON MOVEMENT
Observations made during the orientation studies
suggested that changes in orientation during the period
of wetting might be associated mainly with vertical
movements. To determine whether this was the case, 25
Acmaea digitalis on vertical granite rocks were watched
during night high tides and 25 during day high tides.
Rocks 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used in these observations
(see Table 4). A spot of paint was placed on the rock
surface in front of each limpet's head and also on the
peak of its shell; both spots of paint were marked with
matching numbers in India ink. During the watches the
vertical and horizontal distancesbetween the anterior
portion of each limpet and its spot of paint on the rock
were recorded every ten minutes.
Two of the fifty individual movement paths are shown
in Figure 5. The movement paths showed that moving animals
were almost always oriented with the anterior end of the
shell pointed in the direction of movement, but a change
in orientation sometimes occurred with relatively little
forward movement (Figure 6). Data on movement and rotation
