head downward orientation at low tide to a more random,
orientation on the rocks during high tide requires that
some limpets rotate upward. To check whether there was a
tendency for them to turn upward toward the right (counter-
clockwise) or upward toward the left (clockwise), the
data from Table 2 were used as follows. The limpet popu-
lation was divided into left-oriented animals (limpets
facing clock directions 7 to 11) and right-oriented an-
imals (limpets facing clock directions 1 to 5). The limp-
ets facing 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock were divided equally
between right and left facing groups. The mean direction
of orientation and standard deviation were calculated for
both left and right facing groups for each period of ob-
servation shown in Table 2. The results are given in Table
3. Some tendency to turn upward at the beginning of the
observation period and downward toward the end is indi-
cated, but there is no clearcut preference for either a
clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. Standard deviations
are largest and show most variation during periods when
the rock was splashed, reflecting the rather random or-
ientation of the high and low Acmaea digitalis populations
during the two tidal cycles. Rotational movement was great-
est during HHW, and greatest for the low group of limpets
which received the most splash. As the water level dropped
and splash declined, activity of the population decreased
and the per cent of limpets with heads oriented downward
and toward the right, in the directions of 4 to 6 o'clock.
increased.
