and after each period of high water for several successive
days. The per cent known to have moved to a new position
(homing limpets and non-moving limpets had the same posit¬
ions) and the per cent showing a net upward displacement
at each LHW and HHW period are recorded in Figures 15 and
16. The results clearly show that the per cent of limpets
moving and showing an upward displacement consistently
increases during HHW and decreases during LHW. Two factors
which might be responsible for this behavior, duration of
the period of wetting and time of the high tide, are con-
sidered below.
Is there a correlation between duration of the per-
iod of wetting and the net upward (or downward) displace¬
ment of the population at high tide? Actual duration of

splash was not measured, but the periods of HHW and LHW
were arranged in order of decreasing height of the tide
(as actually measured on the tide guage operated by the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, about one mile from the
observation site). The per cent of the population showing
net vertical displacement upward and downward (Figure 17,
top), and the amount of vertical displacement upward and
downward (Figure 17, bottom) were calculated for each high
tide. While the method used to establish relative duration
of wetting periods did not take into account variations due
to differences in turbulence, the results show that, in
general, the higher the height of high water, the larger
the per cent of the population exhibiting a net upward dis¬
