LHWs direct sunlight dried the rock surface sooner. The
results shown in Figure 2 suggest that activity of the
THE
population is proportional tofdegree of wetting of the
limpet population and the rock surface at high tide.
Since at some LHWs the whole population was effect¬
ively wetted and at others only the lower limpets re¬
ceived significant splash, for subsequent high tide stud-
ies the population on the rock face was divided into
groups; a high group ranging from about 14 to 18 feet
above mean LLW, and a low group located 9 to 12 feet above
mean LLW. Hourly observations were made during a HHW and
a LHW period. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure
3. The amount of rotation and the per cent of the popu-
lation rotating is clearly related to the amount of splash
received. The graphs in Figure 3 perhaps explain the dif¬
ferences in rotational activity shown by the limpets during
the three successive tidal cycles portrayed in Figure 2.
In Figure 3, in the low group of limpets at the high tide
at 2000 hours, about 30 animals were rotating; as a group
they rotated a minimum of 105 clock units. Similar high
amounts of rotation occurred all during the splash period.
These results, combined with the results on direction of
rotation presented in Figure 2, show that orientation and
direction of rotation tend to be random during the time the
rock is thoroughly wetted. This tendency toward random or-
ientation was also apparent from watching the limpet move-
ments during periods of splash.
For the limpet population to shift from a primarily
