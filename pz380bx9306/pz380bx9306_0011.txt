Third, is there a final movement downward, corres¬
ponding with the tendency to orient head down at low tide?
The final individual movements and orientations for the 50
limpets depicted in Figures 7 and 8 are presented in Fig¬
ure 11. Most limpets do exhibit a final movement downward
associated with a final head down orientation. Of those
whose final movement was upward, some only changed direc¬
tion from, say, 6 to 4 o'clock. While this is an upward
movement, the final orientation is still down, explaining
why fewer limpets had a terminal head up orientation than
exhibited final movement upward.
Fourth, does the percent of limpets which moved
during a given high tide increase with increasing dura-
tion of the period of wetting? Data from the 9 watches in
Figures 7 and 8 are plotted in Figure 12; they show that
the per cent of animals moving does tend to increase as
the period of wetting gets longer. The longer wetting
periods occurred at night, so one can't adequately compare
the results obtained during night and day.
Fifth, are there relationships between the amount of
time spent moving, the distance moved, the duration of
wetting, and the time of day? Data for individual limpet
movements appear in Figure 13. The results show that the
distances moved and time spent moving tend to increase
as the wetting periods get longer. Distance moved is
roughly proportional to time spent moving. The animals
were generally wetted for longer periods at night, so
it is difficult to contrast the day and night results.
