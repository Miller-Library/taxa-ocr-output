Figure 10 The per cent of the limpets which showed an initial upward rotation
during two high tide studies. N=25 for group B (calculated from
data used in figures 7 and 8). In group A (supplementary dataj see
xt), N=21 for the night and N=13 for the day,

Figure 12 The per cent of the population that moved during a high tide versus
the duration of wetting. Circles give results for daytime high tides,
solid dots give those for high tides at night.

Circles give daytime rates, dots give rates at night.

Rates of movement of Acmaea digitalis during day and night high tides.
N=25 for the day; N=22 for the night. Average rate for the day is
0.9 mm/min.; average rate for the night is 1.0 mm/min.

in both figures show the per cent of the population known to have
moved at each high tide. The solid line indicates the per cent of
the population which showed a net vertical displacement upward,
(i.e. the per cent of the moving limpets whose terminal positions
were higher than their starting positions). Hrepresents HHW;
represents LHW; N is night; D is day; D and N represent dawn and
