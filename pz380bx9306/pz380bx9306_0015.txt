longer than usual periods of wetting and also causing the
population to move upward on the rock. Second, the height of
LHW in the last watch was about 5 feet, and that of HHW only
about 6 feet, so the poriods of wetting were of nearly the
same duration for both high tides. It was only during LHW
periods with a maximum height of 4.4 to 3.0 feet (Figure
17) that tendency toward a downward displacement with little
upward displacement became marked.
Approximately 25% of the limpets observed in the course
of the present study showed a tendency to home, i.e., re-
turn to a specific position and orientation on the rock.
Galbraith (1965) reported finding homing in A. digitalis
on relatively smooth rocks bearing ridges and numerous
small depressions. Millard (1966) likewise found some A.
digitalis homing on granite rocks at Pacific Grove.
Villee and Groody (1940) also noted this tendency but
preferred not to call it homing behavior. Frank (1965),
in Oregon, reported no evidences of homing.
