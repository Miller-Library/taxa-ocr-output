is were individually marked. The shell of each limpet was
painted with a patch of yellow paint upon which an ident-
ifying number was marked in India ink. Each limpet's or-
ientation was recorded approximately every 3 hours during
lower low water (LLW), lower high water (LHW), higher low
water (HLW), and the intervening mid-tides, on 3 successive
days. No reading was taken at higher high water (HHW) due
to heavy surf.
The results, shown in Table 1, clearly indicate that
changes in orientation take place during the tidal cycle.
The net change in orientation for each individual be-
tween successive observations was then computed, assuming
that rotation in each case was accomplished by turning the
minimum number of clock units necessary to account for the
change (Figure 2). During the first tidal cycle the pop-
ulation showed more rotation upward with a rising tide and
more rotation downward with a receding tide, but this was
not repeated in the next two tidal cycles.
The general activity of the population, as measured
by the sum of the up and down rotation, and by the per
cent of the population rotating (Figure 2), shows a peak
associated with each high tide. The decrease in the height
of these peaks of activity from one recorded high tide to
the next is associated with a slight decrease in the heights
of successive LHWs, and a resultant decrease in both the
number of animals being effectively wetted and the duraÂ¬
tion of the period of splash. Also, during the first re-
corded LHW a fog bank blocked the sunlight, while on later
