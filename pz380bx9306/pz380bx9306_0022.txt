Tendency of limpets to orient with heads downward
and to the right during HHW and LHW, May 16-17, 1966.
Dotted lines show percent of limpet population or-
iented with the head downward (4 to 8 o'clock, plus
half the individuals headed toward 3 o'clock and
9 o'clock). Solid lines show percent of limpet popÂ¬
ulation oriented with the head to the right (1 to 9
o'clock, plus half the individuals headed toward 12
o'clock and 6 o'clock). Time and splash diagrams are
the same as those on Figure 3.
Typical movement paths for Acmaea digitalis during
high tide. The clockorier
ation of the limpet
(underlined figures) and the time at each partic-
ular position are given. The starting position is
indicated by the double circle. The limpet whose path
is shown on the left returned to its original home
site.
Time lapse diagram of a moving A. dig
talis showing
the relationship between movement and change in
orientation. Outlines show displacement at intervals
of 3.33 minutes. Time and orientation are given as
in Figure 5. The dotted line shows the actual move-
ment of the head of the limpet (the apex of the
trianglo). The solid line shows the movement path
and the orientation that would have been recorded
had the observations been made every 10 minutes as
in Figure 5.
