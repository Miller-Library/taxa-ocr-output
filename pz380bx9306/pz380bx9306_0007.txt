While it is established that on vertical rock surf-
aces Acmaea digitalis populations tend to orient with
heads directed downward and to the right during periods
of low tide, neither the selective advantages nor
the causes of this behavior are er
irely clear. The
limpet Lot
gantea orients much as does A. dig:
talis
at low tide, and Abbott (1956) has suggested that with the
head down, water run-off coming down the rock from waye
splash would help clean the nuchal cavity of waste ma-
terials. He also points out that water trapped in the
mantle groove as the tide recedes would drain toward the
anterior end, thus keeping the head and ctenidium wet
while the limpet is exposed at low tide. Abbott also
suggests that an orientation with the head down and to
the right might be slightly more advantageous than with
the head down and to the left, since in the former case
water running down the rock would tend to reinforce the
existing ciliary currents in the nuchal cavity.
In Acmaea, as in Lottia, the anal opening lies on
the right side of the nuchal cavity, so waterrun-offon
the rock could easily help remove the waste materials
from a limpet orientated toward 3 to 5 o'clock. Orien-
tation toward 7 to 11 o'clock may present more of a
problem since the feces would have to travel a greater
distance through the mantle cavity to get out. However.
