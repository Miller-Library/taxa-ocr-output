stress of 3 x 10' N/m2 (Figure 3).
Figure 7 illustrates the sustained contraction stress
in response to Ach and the relaxing effect induced by 5-HT.
Ach potentiated the muscle to sustain a stress of lX 10' N/m'
for 420 seconds in the absence of electrical stimulation.
a relaxation rate of 23.8 N m2/sec. The application of
3-HT at the point of maximum contraction stress (possible
catch state) evoked by Ach alone causes a relaxation to
baseline in 25 seconds, a relaxation rate of 800 N m-2/sec.
approximately 33 times faster than the rate in Ach saline
alone.
DISCUSSION
The characteristic sawtooth appearance that fuses to
a tetanus at higher rates of repeated stimulation is also
observed in Cryptochiton stelleri (Harrison 1975). By
adjusting the frequency of stimulation above the minimum
for tetanus, a several fold increase in the stress is possible.
This is in contrast to most vertebrate muscle (cat eye muscle
being an exception) where variation in stimulation frequency
has little influence on force. Note that the degree to
which a given test saline alone potentiates a contraction
varied widely between solution and further differed when
an electrical stimuli was applied to the muscle in the
bath. The mechanism of potentiation of contraction is
not clearly understood but it is likely to involve many
sites of action (Schulman and Weight 1976). The data
generated in this work cannot elucidate the details of the
