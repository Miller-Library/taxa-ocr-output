membrane is either slowed down or somewhat counteracted
by the action of caffeine on the muscle. Axelsson and Thesleff
(1958) found the same result in vertebrate striated muscle.
A mechanism for this effect cannot be derived from the data
I obtained.
Acetylcholine and 5-HT
Potentiation of contractions by Ach in response to
electrical stimuli and the relaxation caused by 5-HT alone
on the shell-foot retractor muscle have also been found in
gastropod radular retractor muscles (Mattison and Arvidsson 1966).
The enhanced response to electrical stimulation in 5-HT
(concentrations below 10 6M) were also found in other gastropods
(Kobayashi and Muneoka 1980) and in an opistobranch (Cohen
et al 1978). The increase in relaxation rate caused by
S-Hr on Ach-induced stress is suggestive of a catch mechanism.
as is found in the ABRM of Mytilus edulis. Ach injections
(10 M) in the isolated ABRM initiate catch (Cole and Twarog
1971) and 5-HT(10"M), the probable transmitter substance
feleased by relaxing nerves in Mytilus (Twarog 1954,1968)
release catch. Certain features of its mode of action are
known (Cole and Twarog 1971) while other remain unclear.
Some evidence points to its effect in increasing membrane
conductance and triggering reaction cascaded to reduce the
level of free intracellular Ca tTwarog 1966), an effect
opposite that of caffeine. It may be worthwhile to conduct
an experiment to test the effect of 5-HT applications on a
muscle previously bathed in caffeine.
