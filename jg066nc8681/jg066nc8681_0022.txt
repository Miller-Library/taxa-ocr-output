Twitch response to single and double stimuli.
The interval between double stimuli is increased
from 2 to 10 seconds.
Summation and Tetanic Response. Increasing the
frequency of repeated stimulation from 1 pulse
per second to 10 pulses per second causes fusion
to a tetanus.
Effects of Solutions and Electrical Stimulation
on the Contraction Stress of the Muscle. The
effect of each solution alone is indicated by
the cross-bars. Additional effects of the first
series of shocks in each solution are indicated
by the clear bars.
Effect of Series of Shocks on Muscle Contraction,
Responses are expressed as net percentage increases
above (or decreases below) the muscle stress evoked
in artificial seawater (ASW), 12 x 10' N/m? and
does not include the loading stress of 9 x 104 N/m2
which was common to all the muscle preparations.
The second series of shocks in the test solutions
are shown'as percentage increases (or decreases)
over the corresponding value in ASW of 11 x 10' N/m2.
The three percentages slightly above the ASW baseline
are in actuality on the baseline denoting a 0% increase.
