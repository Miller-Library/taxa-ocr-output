to exhibit a catch mechanism of contraction.
A maximum contraction stress of 3.1x 10Â° N/m was
measured in the shell-foot retractor muscle. To obtain
an indication of the muscle contribution to limpet
tenacity this value was compared to the stress necessary
to dislodge a tightly clamped limpet from an intertidal
rock and found to be of equal magnitude.
