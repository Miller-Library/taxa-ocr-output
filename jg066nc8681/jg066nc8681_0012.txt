potentiation mechanism but does suggest some general
aspects likely to be involved in the overall mechanism
which will be discussed in different sections.
High Ca
Direct entry and diffusion of Ca through the small
diameter of the shell-foot retractor muscle cells more
than likely accounts for muscle contraction as is found
for other molluscan muscles (Huddart et al 1977, retractor
and columella muscles). In experiment 3 the ability of
the muscle to repeatedly develop a constant muscle stress
(equal to that developed after the second series of shocks)
in response to a fourth series of shocks is suggestive of
the importance of an external Ca concentration. This
response may have been possible only in the presence of
the high Ca "of the saline. Fatigue seems to have been
significantly lowered from that observed in ASW after the
fourth series of shocks. The external Ca may have shifted
the ionic balance at the cell membrane in favor of repeated
potentiation of contractions of constant stress. Since
the high Ca levels potentiated a contraction 257 higher
than in AsW after the first series of shocks(Figure 4).
it could be said that the rate of entry of Ca into the cell
is likely to be fast enough to enable potentiation in
response to this specific electrical stimulation. If the
rate is faster than the rate required to potentiate in
response to repeated stimuli, it may account for potentiation
