effects
of certain test salines on the muscle contraction stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lottia gigantea were collected at Pacific Grove, Ca..
and kept at 14 degrees Celsius in circulating seawater.
Limpets were injected with 5 ml MgCl, solution (1 part
I M MgCl, to 2 part seawater) to induce relaxation in the
foot muscle. With the limpet on its dorsal side, longitudinal
cuts 5mm apart were made on the shell-foot retractor muscle
from its point of attachment on the shell to the ventral
surface of the foot (10-12 mm depending on the size of
the limpet). The muscle segment was then teased away from
the shell and the most lateral layer (lmm) was used as the
final preparation (dimensions: 10mmx 5mmx lmm). The
muscle preparation was placed in running seawater for 1
hour to allow recovery from the anesthetic.
The preparation was mounted horizontally between two
flattened alligator clips. One clip was fixed to the bottom
of the dish containing the test solution. A force transducer
was attached via a fine chain to the free-moving clip,
The sample was stretched by approximately 202 (2mm) above
its dissected length to return it to its in vivo length
(as measured in the intact limpet prior to dissection).
This extension required a force of 0.2 N(a stress of
4 x 10" N/m*). An additional loading force of O.25N
was applied (total loading stress of 9x 10' N/m.
