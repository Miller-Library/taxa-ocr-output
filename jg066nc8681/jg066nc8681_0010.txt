does not increase on every consecutive shock but instead
there is a tendency to maintain a constant stress (first
10 shocks). When high K-caffeine is added directly onto
the muscle, the stress increases on each subsequent shock
(shocks + 10-15) until it reaches a maximum. This stress
decreases despite continued stimulation. The addition of
high K-caffeine during this stress decrease appears to
prevent further loss of stress and even enhances the response
of the muscle to continued electrical stimulation. I
can offer no specific mechanism for this action of high K
caffeine.
Experiment 5: Although Ach (10 *) itself had minimal
effect on the muscle, it potentiated a contraction stress of
25 x 10' N/m' when the muscle was electrically stimulated
in the solution (from Experiment 3). The second series
of shocks in Ach evokes a stress equal to that evoked
by the second series in ASW (20.4 x 10' N/m2). When the
muscle was exposed to 5-HT (10 M) alone, a 1002 relaxation
of the loading stress (9 x 10' N/m2) was observed. When
electrically stimulated, muscle in 5-HT was more responsive
than the same muscle in ASW. This is reflected in the
absolute increase in stress caused by the 5-HT saline after
electrical stimulation (18 x 10' N/m) of the muscle. Compare
this with an absolute increase in stress in ASW in response
to equivalent electrical stimulation (12 x 10â€œ N/m2). However.
because the shock in 5-HT was applied at an already decreasing
