of twitches as well (as in skeletal smooth muscle). However.
if the rate of entry is not fast enough for twitch potentiation
then the Ca" concentration may only play a role in prolonged
contractions evoked by repeated stimuli. Atwater (1974)
found evidence for the latter in the giant retractor cells
of Megabalanus psittacus.
Low Na
Note that the low Na saline I used is actually a zero-Nat
saline (Triscl replacement). Therefore, the inability of
the muscle to develop a substantial stress on the second
series of shocks in this low Na (302 decrease below the
stress developed in ASW) suggest the need to have an external
Na concentration to allow responses to electrical stimulation
beyond the initial series of shocks. Subsequent responses
may need a Na influx such as that required in vertebrate
skeletal muscle to initiate an action potential and cause a
contraction. Enough Na may have already been present in the
immediate surroundings of the muscle cells to allow a subs-
tantial response to the first series of shocks in the low
Na saline. Experiments with high Na saline and blocking
agents such as curare might elucidate the nature of the
mechanism involving Nakions (i.e. the possible existence
of a sodium pump).
