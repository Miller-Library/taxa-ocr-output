A Grass S44 stimulator and a bipolar electrode were used
to deliver electrical stimuli to the muscle.
A standard artificial seawater solution (ASW) was used
as a control (470 mM Nacl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Cacl,, 5 mM Hepes,
pH - 8.1) to test the following altered salines: High K
(400mM KCl, 80 mM Nacl), caffeine (30mM), high K-caffeine
(30 mM in high K), high Ca (replaced Mgcl with Cacl.),
low Na(replaced NaCl with Triscl), 5-hydroxytryptamine (10-4M).
acetylcholine (10 "M) and a hypertonic solution (300mM in
ASW). All solutions were titrated to pH of 8.1 with .5M Naoh
and stored at 4 degrees Celsius.
Experiment 1
Single and twin shocks of 12 Volts, 50 millisecond pulse
duration were applied to muscle preparations in ASW. The
interval between double stimuli was varied between 2 and
10 seconds.
Experiment 2
The rate of repeated stimulation was varied from 1 to 10
pulses per second at 15 Volts, 60 ms pulse duration for
33 second applications.
Experiment 3
The effect of various solutions on the stress developed by
the muscle were investigated. Each solution was tested on
8 muscle samples. Each muscle sample was used to test only
one solution and its ASW control. Solution baths were
maintained at 15 degrees Celsius and were flushed every
