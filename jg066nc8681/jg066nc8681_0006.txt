10 minutes (except when indicated) in the following order:
ASW, test solution, ASW, test solution. The effect of
the solution alone on the muscle was tested without elec-
trically stimulating the muscle in the bath. Eight muscle
samples were then bathed in each solution and this time the
muscle was electrically stimulated. Series of shocks of
90 Volts, 6 ms pulse duration, 10 pulses per second, and
3 second duration were applied. At the time of maximum
tension evoked by the solution alone, the first series of
shocks was applied; a second series was applied 1 minute
later, etc. In solutions in which there was no measurable
effect on the muscle stress by the solution alone, the
first series of shocks were delivered after 2 minutes of
bathing and the second series after 3 minutes, etc.
Contraction stress, contraction times (time from baseline to
maximum peak) and relaxation times (time from peak to baseline)
were calculated for each muscle response.
Experiment 4
Repeated single shocks of 60 Volts, 6 ms pulse duration
with 10 second intervals between shocks were applied to 8
muscle samples in contact with (but not submerged in) ASW.
High K-caffeine (5ml) saline was applied directly onto the
muscle while it was still in contact with ASW.
Experiment 5
Three muscle preparations were placed in contact with Ach
saline and allowed to remain there until the muscle stress
subsided to baseline. 5-HT (5ml) was applied directly to
the muscle once the maximum muscle stress evoked by the Ach
