ABSTRACT
The ability of limpets to exhibit high tenacity
in clamping down on rocks for prolonged periods of time
is accounted for by a possible catch mechanism. Contractile
properties of a preparation of the shell-foot retractor
muscle of the limpet Lottia gigantea were investigated
using salines of altered ionic concentrations and known
muscle effectors (caffeine, acetylcholine, and 5-hydroxy-
tryptamine). The following results were obtained;
1. The shell-foot retractor muscle exhibits twitch responses
and summation characteristic of most muscle types.
2. Acetylcholine, caffeine, high K'saline and high K-
caffeine saline induce muscle stress in the absence
of electrical stimulation.
3. 5-HT reduces muscle stress in the absence of electrical
stimulation.
4. High Ca, low Na, caffeine, high K, high K-caffeine,
a hypertonic solution, Ach and 5-HT potentiate a
contraction in response to electrical stimulation.
The responses vary between test salines and depend
on prior response to electrical stimulation and
exposure time of 'the muscle to the test solution.
5.
Acetylcholine alone induces a sustained contraction
stress. 5-HT relaxes this contraction at a relaxation
rate 33 times the rate in acetylcholine alone. This
pharmacologic response is evident in muscles known
