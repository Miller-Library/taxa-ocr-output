INTRODUCTION
Molluscan muscle has the capability to develop great
tensions and sustain prolonged contraction stresses
through a "catch" mechanism. This mechanism has been
extensively studied in the anterior byssus retractor muscle
(ABRM) of Mytilus edulis (Twarog 1954,1960,1967,1967a, 1968.
1969,1971,1972) and it is believed to be a type of mechanism
available to many muscles which may develop specialization
for catch to varying degrees (Wilson and Larimer 1968). I
examined the possibility that a catch mechanism exists in
limpet shell-foot retractor muscle. The existence of such a
mechanism might account for limpets' ability to remain
tightly clamped down on a rock for extended periods of
time when faced with wave shock or dessication stresses.
This work is the first to study the properties of limpet
muscle. I began by examining the muscle response to single
and repeated electrical stimulation of varying strength,
duration, and frequency. Interest in the catch hypothesis
then led me to examine the pharmacological properties of
the muscle. By altering a standard artificial seawater
solution, the effects of relative concentrations of major
ions were tested on the muscle, using the solution alone
and accompanied by electrical stimulation; changes in the
contraction stress and relaxation times were noted, Known
muscle effectors such as caffeine, acetylcholine and 5-HT
salines were also used to examine contractile properties
of the muscle preparation. Data suggestive of catch is
