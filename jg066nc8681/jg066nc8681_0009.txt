provided that a rest interval of 60 seconds is allowed
between trials. However, after six repetitions, the
contraction stress evoked became successively lower
(2 x 10' N/m' after six series of shocks) than would be
accounted for by fatigue (as measured in ASW (6 x 10* N/m2).
Note that these values are those obtained by the applied
stimulus and do not include the loading stress of 9 x 10* N/m?.
High K and High K-caffeine: High K and High K-caffeine
salines potentiated tonic contractions which peaked at
40 seconds and 30 seconds respectively after the initial
contact with the muscle. The muscle responsiveness to
electrical stimuli in the High Kalone decreased to zero
after the first 4 minutes in the bath. When caffeine is
present in the high K medium however, the muscle remains
responsive to electrical stimulation for the first 7 minutes
of bathing. The relaxation time after a shock in High K
alone is decreased from 27 seconds to 8 seconds when caffeine
is in the medium (Figure 5). The relaxation time of the
phasic waveform after electrical stimulation in the caffeine
saline alone is approximately 6 seconds. Note that when
both high K and caffeine are in the same medium, the relaÂ¬
xation time is not an average of the two but is much closer
to that measured in caffeine alone. Figure 5 illustrates
typical waveforms in caffeine, high K and high K-caffeine.
Experiment 4: Figure 6 illustrates the summation effect
of repeated single shocks of 60 Volts, 6 ms pulse duration,
10 second intervals between shocks. Note that the stress
