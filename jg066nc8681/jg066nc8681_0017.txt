Table 1(adapted from Schmidt-Nielsen 1979) gives maximum
contraction stress values measured in various animals. I
measured a value of 3.1 x 102 N/m2 for the limpet shell-
foot retractor muscle. This stress was reproducible as it
did not irreversibly damage the muscle preparation. To
get an indication of the contribution the muscle contraction
stress makes to a limpet's tenacity, this value can be
compared to the stress necessary to pry a limpet off a
rock. The latter is a value of 1-4 x 10° N/m? (Denny 1985
pers.comm) and it is created by a low pressure in the mucus
of the foot when the retractor muscle contracts, thus
adhering the limpet to the rock and accounting for its
high tenacity. My value may be an underestimate due to the
nature of the muscle preparation in which it was measured.
I did not work with individual muscle fibers; therefore, the
number of fibers contracting in any one particular direction
upon stimulation, is likely a function of their angle of
orientation relative to the direction in which the contraction
stress is measured. Nevertheless, if one assumes that the
limpet is exerting maximum contraction stress when it
detects a stimulus on its shell to avoid being dislodged,
then this value of 3.1x 10° N/m reflects the ability of the
SFR muscle to account for most of the stress necessary to
keep the limpet clamped down on the rock. Factors such as
osmotic stress and/or dessication may also play an interactive
role in affecting the limpet's tenacity (Boggs and Marzuola,
pers. comm).
