1-hour bath in hypertonic saline indicates a loss of
responsiveness to electrical stimulation possibly due to
prolonged exposures to high tonicty (Figure 4). This
response may be experienced in vivo when the limpet is
challenged with osmotic stresses and/or dessication.
After the first two series of shocks, progressive series of
stimuli for an hour thereafter however, evoked constant
stress never below 50% of the corresponding stress in ASW.
This data indicates that although the stress evoked in
hypertonic saline is far from maximum, it does not change
sharply over time after the first hour of exposure to
hypertonic media. It would then be fair to expect that
a live limpet should be able to withstand prolonged periods
of conditions which cause its muscle to be in a hypertonic
state, despite its overall depressed ability to evoke
high contraction stress. Its tenacity might be expected
to be lower due to a depressed muscle performance; however.
the rate at which its tenacity decreases will likely remain
relatively constant over time.

Caffeine has been reported to modify the properties

manifestations is an effect of caffeine that induces
changes in the distribution of Ca and modifies its movement
