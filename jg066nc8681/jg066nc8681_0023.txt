FIGURE 5. Effect of Caffeine, High K and High Ktcaffeine
on Waveforms and Relaxation Times.
FIGURE 6.
Effect of High K-Caffeine on Summation of
repeated single shocks. High K-Caffeine
potentiates stress accumulation in response
to electrical stimulation. It also interferes
with decrease of muscle stress in the second
application and potentiates subsequent response
to electrical stimuli.
FIGURE
5-Hr Relaxation of Ach-induced contraction stress.
Ach (10""M) bath alone induces a prolonged
contraction (top waveform) that can be relaxed
by 5-HT (10 "M) at a rate 33 times faster than
in Ach.

Stresses of Various animal muscles. The shell-
foot retractor muscle appears to have a maximum
contraction stress in the lower range of values
listed.
