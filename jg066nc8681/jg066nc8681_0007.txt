solution was reached.
(elaxation times for Ach alone and
Ach + 5-HT trials were recorded.
RESULTS
Experiment 1: A single contraction was evoked by a single
stimulus and is therefore classified as a twitch response.
Based on criteria in Schmidt-Nielsen (1979) the waveform
obtained in the response is characterized as phasic (Figure 1)
Double stimuli set apart by short intervals result in
summation and a contraction stress higher than that evoked
by a single twith is recorded.
Experiment 2: Repeated stimulation of the muscle at 15 Volts
and 60 ms pulse duration, 1 pps, and 33 second duration
evokes a tonic waveform. Summation in the tonic mode at a
rate of I pps gives a characteristic "sawtooth" appearance.
A higher rate of stimulation (10 pps) evokes a higher maximum
stress and fusion to a tetanus (Figure 2).
The responses recorded in the first two experiments are
characteristic of most muscle types (Mattison and Arvidsson
1966; Heyer et al 1973; Schmidt-Nielsen 1979).
Experiment 3: Figure 3 shows those solutions which by
themselves affected the muscle stress. Also indicated are
the additional effects of the first series of electrical
stimuli in the given solution. The hypertonic solution,
high Ca and low Na salines alone had no measurable effect
on the muscle stress and therefore are not included in Fig.3.
