Figure 4 shows the effects of the first and second series
of shocks on the muscle stress in each test solution
expressed as a percentage increase above the stress measured
in Asw (12 x 10" N/m2 in the first series and 11.4 x 104 N/m
in second series of shocks).
High Caf: The high Ca saline potentiated a contraction
stress when the muscle was electrically stimulated. Stresses
evoked by the fourth series of shocks were equal to those
evoked by the second series of shocks. This finding is
contrasted with that in ASW after the fourth series of
shocks, where the stresses were half the size of those evoked
by the second series of shocks in ASW.
Low Na: Low Na saline potentiated a contraction appro-
ximately 367 above that of ASW in the first series of
shocks. However, note that the response to the second series
of shocks in the solution shows a great decrease from the
first contraction stress.
Hypertonic saline solution: After a 5-minute bath in
hypertonic saline, the muscle responded to electrical
stimulation with a contraction stress higher than that in ASW.
In contrast to this, a 1-hour bath in hypertonic saline
depressed the muscle response to electrical stimulation
to a stress 452 below that in ASW.
Caffeine: Although caffeine itself had minimal effect
on the muscle, it appears to potentiate the highest
contraction stress of all the solutions tested in response
to electrical stimulation. The response can be repeated
