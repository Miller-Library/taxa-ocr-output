across cellular membrane components. Mechanisms evident
in muscles that respond to caffeine in the same way that
the shell-foot retractor muscle does suggest a Ca mobi-
lization role for caffeine. It is credited with increasing
the cell membrane permeability to Ca'tinflux and efflux.
(Sandow 1965, frog semitendinosus; Muneoka and Mizonishi
1969, Nytilus edulis; Chiarandini 1970, crayfish; Ashley
1977. Blanus nubilus). The results obtained in experiment
3 showing the successive decrease in stress after the
sixth series of shocks (a stress reduction lower than can
be accounted for by fatigue) in the caffeine saline may
suggest that the source from which caffeine releases Ca'
to induce contraction is dependent at least in part on
the external Ca concentration. A similar result in
response to caffeine was found in crayfish muscle (Chiarandini
1970). It would be interesting to treat the SFR muscle
with high Ca'and low Ca2 salines to test for any differences
in repeated response to electrical stimulation.
High Kand High K-Caffeine
The unresponsiveness of the muscle in the High Kafter
4 minutes of bathing and electrical stimulation may be an
indication that the high K increasingly depolarizes more of
the muscle cell membranes over time, thus rendering it
virtually impossible to evoke a further mechanical response
when the muscle is shocked. The shortened relaxation time
of a contraction in high K-caffeine (Figure 5) seems to
suggest that the depolarizing action of high kon the cell
