again as the apex moves over the anterior margin.
The high profile models reveal that having either a
lowered apex or no apex at all is a slight advantage in terms
of reducing stress, at least up to the 90% apex position; and
that having variable thickness is, in all cases, a significant
advantage to the shell.
These findings parallel what may be observed in the field;
that the vast majority of limpets are not perfectly conic, but
rather have a reduced slope near the apex. Subtidally,
where there is no threat of desiccation, one will find many
keyhole limpets such as Fissurella volcano which have no
apex at all. Further investigation and observation reveal
that all limpets have variable shell thickness to some degree.
The data from the simulation suggests why. If one looks at
the shear stress diagrams of the 'high profile
limpet (appendix A), one finds that at the 50% apex position
the area of maximum stress is in the apex of the shell. By
comparison one sees that for the "low apex" shell(appendix C)
while the stresses remain approximately equal in other parts
of the shell, they are reduced in the apex region. Therefore
it makes sense that a shell with a lowered apex or no apex
at all, all other factors being equal, would have a reduced
maximum stress. Only occasionally, in such species as
Acmaea mitra does one find a shell as high-spired as in these
experiments. As the apex on the 'high profile" shell moyes
