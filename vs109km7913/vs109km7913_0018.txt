Figure 1 - Diagrams of computer models. (A) Top view of
B,C, &D with node numbers and scale (B) Side view of "high
profile" model with scale. (C) Side view of "low apex" model.
(D) Side view of "low profile" model. (E) Side view of "no
apex“ model. (F) Top view of E. (G) Side view of 'variable
thickness“ model. (H) Top view of G.
Figures 283 — Graphs of maximum shear and tensile stresses
versus apex position when the shell is loaded by a muscle
force only. Both shows, with one exception, the trend
toward decreasing stress as the apex moyes forward. In both
cases the 'low profile" model decreases only partially before
increasing (see text). Note that shear stress is much greater
than tensile stress.
Figure 4 - Maximum stress versus apex position for a
variable thickness model with only the muscle force applied
Note that shear stress is much greater than tensile stress.
The trend in each is toward a decreasing stress as the apex is
moved forward.
Figure 5 — Maximum stress versus apex position for a
variable shell thickness model with a simulated bird peck
applied in addition to the muscle force. Shear stress is
greater than tensile stress and both tend to increase as the
apex is moved forward.
Figure 6 - Maximum stress versus apex position for a
variable thickness model with a simulated "bulldozer" force
applied in addition to the muscle force. Shear stress is
significantly greater than tensile stress and increases
markedly as the apex is moved forward. Tensile stress
increases only slightly and than decreases again
