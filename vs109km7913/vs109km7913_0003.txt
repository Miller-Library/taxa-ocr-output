Plus (MacNeal Schwendler, 1986). This finite element
analysis program is designed to perform stress and vibrational
analysis of mechanical systems and structures. The analyst
provides the following for his/her structure:
the spatial location of the nodal points defining the
structure
the mass and material properties of the structure
the types of connections between the nodes (e.g.
beams or
plates)
any boundary conditions or structural restraints
the static or dynamic load forces
and the type of analysis desired
The program then generates a mathematical model of discrete
nodes and elements from this information and simulates its
physical behavior under the given conditions. It is up to the
analyst to create the descretization (that is, the connectivity
of finite nodes) which will most accurately reflect the
structure's behavior. In general, the more nodal points the
more accurate the model.
The following limpet morphologies were developed for this
experimentation (figure 1)
1. "High profile" — a uniform thickness shell with a
height to diameter ratio of 0.5
2. Low profile" — a uniform thickness shell with a
height to diameter ratio of 0.25
