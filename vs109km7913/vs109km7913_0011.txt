each separate force it sees. That is to say, neither directly
in the center of the shell which would be ideal for a bird
peck only, nor completely over the anterior margin, ideal
for the muscle force only, but rather somewhere in between.
This compromise predominates in actual limpets, as seen in
Lindberg's data
The low profile limpet, however, is much more
complicated. There is no clear trend toward an increased or
decreased maximum stress, in either shear or tension, as the
apex is moved forward. The stresses begin to decrease, only
to sharply increse half-way forward. The low profile model
demonstrates a great disparity between the advantages it
holds in terms of tensile stress and its disadvantages in terms
of shear stress. In terms of tensile stress, a low profile
would be preferable to a high profile. From apex positios of
60% to nearly 90% the low profile limpet has a much lower
tensile stress than the high profile limpets. Looking at shear
stress, however, the low profile limpet has a much higher
maximum stress over all but a very small range of apex
positions. It is almost always a distinct disadvantage to the
limpet. What one must remember to resolve this disparity
is the relative scale of the two stresses. The shear stresses
are significantly higher than the tensile stresses along the
entire range of apex positions. So it is the shear stress
which is the predominent stress and that which should be
