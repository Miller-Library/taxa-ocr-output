A series of computerized limpet models were generated
and their stresses analyzed using finite element analysis to
determine how a variety of shell morphologies would effect
stress distributions and magnitudes in limpet shells. Various
morphologies can affect stress distribution and magnitude.
Large height to diameter ratios, lowered apices, and apices
positioned in the anterior third of the shell were all
determined to be particularly advantageous morphologies in
reducing overall stresses on the shell (in terms of percent of
breaking stress). In addition, shells with increased
thicknesses at the apex and below the muscle scar were
shown to reduce stress concentrations in these areas. These
findings support data collected by David Lindberg (1981) who
showed that of the 20 California limpet species the majority
have medium to medium-high profiles with apices in the
anterior one-third of the shell.
