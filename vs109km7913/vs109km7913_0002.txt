INTRODUCTION
The limpet shell is a conic, rather than spiral, gastropod
shell. This relative simplicity of design makes it a useful tool
for studying the material properties of shell. Yet despite its
general simplicity there are many different limpet shell
morphologies. The shells range in profile (height to diameter
ratio) from very high to quite low, with apex positions
ranging from nearly central to over the anterior margin,
some even beyond. Nearly all have a variability to some
degree among the shell thicknesses in the apex, at the
margin, and in between. Do these different morphologies
effect the stress distributions and magnitudes in the shells?
Which morphologies are structurally advantageous to the shell
and which are detrimental'
To answer these questions, a series of computerized
limpet models of various morphologies were designed using a
finite element analysis program. These models were then
loaded with several forces and the resultant stress data was
analyzed to determine how the models varied
MATERIALS AND METHOD
The experiment was developed and run using an MSC/PAL
stress and vibration analysis program for the Apple Macintosh
