not dislodging it from the substrate. This was based on
observations that birds will often crack a limpet's shell
without dislodging the limpet and that in order to bulldoze
the limpet must be attached to the substrate.
Once the models were built and the forces were applied,
the MSC/PAL program simulated the reaction of the model to
the applied force based on the physical properties of the
material and its mechanical structure. The program
generated a static solution for each model, that is, the nodal
displacements and resultant stresses of the model at static
equilibrium with the applied force.
RESULTS
Experiment 1
In all cases the maximum shear stress was much greater
than the maximum tensile stress(figures 2 and 3).
With one exception, the general trend for both shear and
tensile stresses in these various morphologies was toward a
decreasing maximum stress as the apex position was moyed
forward. This was true for each of the high profile limpets
regardless of any variations (such as low or no apex, or
variable thickness). Worth noting is the fact that while the
values for maximum tensile stress in the high profile limpets
