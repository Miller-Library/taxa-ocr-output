(approximately the basal area of the shell), was designed to
simulate the muscle force of an undisturbed limpet attaching
itself gently to a rock surface(see Grenon and Walker on
tenacity, 1981) In the case of the variable thickness model,
each component of force was divided in half and applied over
two nodes (from 42 to 56 and 62 to 76) to better simulate
the muscle force.
Experiment 2
In addition to the muscle force of experiment 1, two
external forces were applied to the set of variable thickness
limpets: one to simulate a bird peck on the shell, the second,
to simulate a limpet, such as Lottia gigantea, using its shell
to nudge another limpet out of its territory (a bulldozer
effect). The forces were simulated in the following manner
1. The bird peck was a point load of approximately
360 N applied at node 68 with the following components: 300
N in the â€”Y direction, 120 N in the -X, and 160 N in the
-2.
2. The bulldozer force was a point load of 250 N
applied at node 1 in the tX direction.
The force magnitudes were estimated by multiplying the
tenacity of a limpet attaching itself firmly to a rock by
approximately the basal area of the shell, and then
estimating a value large enough to disturb the limpet while
