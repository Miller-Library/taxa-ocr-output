forward this area of maximum stress moves down to the
muscle scar and the advantage of a lowered apex or lack of
apex decreases, eventually becoming a slight disadvantage
when the apex is all the way forward. By increasing their
shell thickness in the areas of maximum stress, the apex and
just below the muscle scar, the variable thickness model
shows that actual limpets have been able to significantly
decrease the percent of breaking stress they experience. This
is due not to a decreased overall stress in those areas (the
force per area is the same), but to an increase in their
breaking strength caused by the increased thickness.
In general, the trend of all types of high profile limpets is
to decrease in maximum stress, tensile or shear, as their
apices move forward. This suggests that it would be to the
advantage of all limpets to have their apices directly over
their anterior margin. Obviously this is not the case. Why?
Experiment 2 reveals that while stresses do indeed decrease
as the apex is moyed forward under a muscle force only,
when an external force such as a bird peck or a bulldozer
action is applied to the shell, the opposite happens, the
stresses increase as the apex is moyed forward. None of
these forces exist in isolation, however. In the field a limpet
experiences a variety of forces which it must be able to
withstand. Therefore a limpet's optimal shell morphology
must be a compromise among the ideal shell morphologies for
