The trend of resultant stresses from the external force of
a bird peck is opposite to that for the muscle force(figure 5)
As the apex is moved forward the maximum stresses
increase, decreasing only slightly at the 100% position
The shear stress markedly increases all the way through
the 100% apex position in the case of the bulldozer action,
while the tensile stress increases to about the 80% apex
position and then decreases (figure 6)

DISCUSSION
In his study of 20 California limpet species, David
Lindberg (1981) found that the majority of the species were
clustered into a morphology of medium to medium-high
profile with an apex in the anterior third of the shell(figure
7). Few had apices at either extreme and only one had a
low profile. This data illustrates well the findings of this
experiment; that a higher profile and an apex compromised
between the two extremes reduces the percent of breaking
stress imposed upon the limpet shell. Logically, this reduced
stress would be beneficial to the animal.
Experiment 1 illustrates that there are indeed differences
in stress distribution and magnitude among morphological
types, most notably that high profile models tend to decrease
in stress as their apex moyes forward while stress in low
profile models decreases only partially before increasing once
