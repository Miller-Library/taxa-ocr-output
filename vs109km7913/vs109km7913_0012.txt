analyzed to determine any advantages that a low profile
might hold as an alternative morphology. Thus a low profile
should generally be considered an undesirable morphology
It should be noted, however, that in some species
specially adapted morphologies exist. Lottia gigantea, for
example, is a low profiled limpet with its apex nearly 1008
forward. Considering that the Lottia is known to protect its
territory by bulldozing other limpets out, it appears to
contradict almost all of the above findings. The hidden
resolution to this contradiction is in Lottia's exaggerated
anterior thickness. A territorial limpet, the Lottia clears the
space around itself by nudging other limpets out with the
anterior surface of its shell, This experiment suggests why,
through the course of evolution, natural selection would favor
Lottia with increased anterior thicknesses.
CONCLUSION
These experiments illustrate that various morphologies do
alter the stress distributions and magnitudes in limpet shells
and that some select morphologies have more desirable
characteristics than others. High profiles, lowered apices,
variable shell thicknesses, and apices balanced between
extremes were all shown to reduce stress. These findings
corrolate well with actual limpet morphologies as observed by
