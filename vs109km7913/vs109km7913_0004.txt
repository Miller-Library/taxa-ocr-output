Low apex" — similar to the 'high profile" shell,
but with a somewhat flattened apex
4. "No apex" — similar to the "high profile" shell, but
without the apex, leaving a hole instead
5 „Variable thickness" — similar to the "high profile
shell, but simulating a shell's natural variability in thickness
For each limpet variation a set of six models was
created: one each with apex positions at 50% (distance
foreward from posterior margin), 60%, 709, 80%, 908, and
100%. Quadrilateral and triangular plates connected the
nodes. Each model was given the same material
properties (table 1) and plate properties (table 2) The
following boundary conditions were placed on the models
Translation in the Y direction and rotation about the Y axis
were zeroed for nodes 1 through 16; translation in the XZ
plane was zeroed for the apical node.
The following forces were then applied.
Experiment 1
A force of 106 05 N was applied to each model in a
horseshoe-shaped pattern, as the sum of 15 7.07 N forces
placed from nodes 42 to 56, directed at a 45-degree angle
downward and toward the center of the horseshoe. This
force, calculated by multiplying the tenacity of a limpet out
of water by the pedal area of the limpet model
