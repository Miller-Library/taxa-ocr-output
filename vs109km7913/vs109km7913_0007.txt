are all very similar, those for maximum shear stress vary,
most importantly between uniform and variable shell
thickness, with variable thickness having a significantly lower
maximum shear stress.
The exception to this trend is the low profile limpet
which decreases in maximum stress as the apex is moved
forward to 808 in shear, 70% in tension; but maximum
stress then increases as the apex is moyed further forward.
It is important to note that the maximum shear stress of the
low profile limpet is almost always higher than that of the
high profile limpets. At best, the maximum shear stress of
the low profile limpet dips to values about equal to those for
high profile limpets of uniform thickness and low or no apex.
It is always much higher than the values for the 'variable
thickness" limpet. In tensile stress quite the opposite
happens, the maximum values for tensile stress in the low
apex model are lower than those for the high profile models
over quite a wide range of apex positions (from 60% to
almost 90%). Note that tensile stresses are much smaller
than shear stresses.
Experiment 2
For high profile limpets with variable thickness, the
maximum shear and tensile stresses caused by a muscle force
decrease as the apex is moved forward (figure 4)
