new shell broke off. After about four days the new shell
became opaque as it continued to thicken. The mantle, whose
margin usually conforms exactly to the margin of the intact
shell, did not contract locally to a shape conforming to the
margin of the slot until after about two days. In no case
did repair begin until this had taken place. In those ani-
mals with deeper slots (see Table 2) the mantle margin was
unable to contract enough to conform to the margin of the
slot and no repair took place.
The high incidence of evidences of natural shell damage
and repair in A. limatula and A. scutum is probably the result
of three factors. First, both species inhabit the lower areas
of the intertidal (Ricketts and Calvin, 1952) where wave
action is heaviest, and where loose rocks and debris which
might be pounded against their shells are more prevalent.
Secondly their shells are both flatter and thinner than those
of the limpets of the higher intertidal areas, thus presenting
a larger and weaker surface. Finally, both species show a
much more rapid rate of repair than either A. scabra or A.
digitalis. Thus an A. scutum or A. limatula with a damaged
shell would be more likely to be able to repair any damage to
its shell before a predator could take advantage of the
weakened shell. Limited observations on shell growth in
