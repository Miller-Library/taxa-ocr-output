Specimens of each of the five species showing evidence of
shell damage were collected from Pescadero Point, Monterey
County, California and from Mussel Point, Pacific Grove,
California on May 24-26, 1966. All levels of the intertidal
area were covered, and both protected areas and regions exposed
to very heavy surf were included in the survey. One hundred
animals showing evidence of having repaired shell damage were
collected; all but two of these occurred where the wave action
was heavy and where debris such as rocks and large shells were
tossed and shifted about by the waves at high tide. Even in
the latter areas animals with damaged shells constituted a very
small minority of the total population.
Of several hundred A. digitalis examined only 3 were found
to be damaged significantly. A. scabra and A. pelta populaÂ¬
tions showed the same small proportion of damaged shells,
although in the areas studied A. pelta was not as abundant as
the other species. Many more damaged shells of A. scutum and
A. limatula were found, but they comprised less than ten per-
cent of the observed populations of these species. Often
several A. scutum or A. limatula with damaged shells were
found in the same small area. Such groups of injured animals
were not found in the other species.
