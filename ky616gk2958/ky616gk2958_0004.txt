The numbers of damaged animals collected and the types
of damage are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, injury to
the edge of the shell, with pieces of the margin chipped off,
is the most common (Plate 1, F). Repair of the margin can be
recognized readily not only by the newness of the repaired
portion but by the ridge which is produced where the new shell
material meets the old. In many cases pieces up to 20% of the
width of the shell have been broken off and replaced. Often
the entire margin of the shell has been broken off and a ring
of newer shell material can be seen clearly all around the
original shell. In A. limatula this new shell material has
the same characteristic file-like appearance as the original
shell.
In four of the animals collected a portion of the top
of the shell near the apex had been crushed (Plate 1. A).
Pieces of the shell had been pushed inward, pressing down the
viscera. Repair had been achieved by the laying down of new
nacreous layers below these pieces of shell, cementing toÂ¬
gether the crushed fragments of the top of the old shell and
partially embedding them to form a solid unit. Any holes left
by missing pieces of shell had been covered over on the inside
by new shell material (Plate 1, B). Where the shell had been
