There were deep pits in the shell, not caused by Didymella
conchae, which were clearly formerly inhabited by barnacles
and may actually have been eroded by them (Plate 1, E).
In conjunction with observations of natural damage,
laboratory studies of repair of artificially induced damage
were undertaken. Three animals of each species were chosen
with normal, undamaged shells. Slots were drilled in the shell
with a high speed dental drill. All the slots were of uni¬
form width, approximately 1.5 mm, and extended varying dis¬
tances from the margin towards the apex. In no case did the
slot extend up to the attachment of the shell muscle. Care
was taken not to damage the mantle. The animals were placed
on rocks in aquaria with constantly circulating seawater and
aeration and kept submerged throughout the experimental period
(May 16 - May 23). They were removed each day, placed on a
glass slide, and the extent to which they had repaired the
slots observed under a compound microscope and measured with
an ocular micrometer. The results are presented in Table 2.
In each case where repair took place, it began with the
laying down of a thin transparent layer at the interior end
of the slot. This layer was gradually extended towards the
margin of the shell and thickened from beneath. Often this
