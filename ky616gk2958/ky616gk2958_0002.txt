Shells of the common limpets of the genus Acmaea found in
the rocky intertidal area of the California coast often show
evidence of having sustained and repaired extensive damage.
Studies of shell damage and repair were made on Acmaea scabra
(Gould, 1846), Acmaea digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833, Acmaea pelta
Eschscholtz, 1833, Acmaea limatula Carpenter, 1864, and Acmaea
scutum Eschscholtz, 1833.
Peppard (1964) studied growth and repair in the shells of
Tegula funebralis and studies of normal growth over a 3 year
period were made of A. digitalis, A. pelta and Acmaea para
digitalis by Frank (1965). Seapy (1966) reports on the
growth of A. limatula over a period of one year. Fretter and
Graham (1962) discuss the general growth in prosobranch molluscs
and include a chapter on the shell. No previous work, however,
has been done on repair in the five species of Acmaea under
consideration here.
