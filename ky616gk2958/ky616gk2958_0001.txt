Buiklev, P. Todd. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University, Pacific Grove, Calif., USA.) Shell damage and repair
in five members of the genus Acmaea (Mollusca:Gastropoda: Prosobranchia).
The Veliger.
Examination of naturally damaged shells of Acmaea scabra, A. digitalis
A. pelta, A. scutum, and A. limatula showed that damage to the margin
due to chipping predominated, but shells were found with regions near
the apex crushed, with severe erosion by a fungus, with cracks extending
from the edge to near the apex, with the tops eroded apparently by
barnacles, and with small holes of unknown origin near the apex. A.
scutum was the species most commonly damaged. Repair was always accÂ¬
omplished by secretion of new nacreous layers below the damaged portion.
Rates of repair of artificially damaged shell margins exceed rates
of growth where the margin remains intaot - Author.
