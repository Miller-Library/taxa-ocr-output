undamaged animals maintained in laboratory aquaria from April
27 to May 21, 1966, suggest that addition of new shell at the
margin occurs more rapidly in A. scabra than in the other
four species, and that new shell may be added at very uneven
rates at different regions of the shell margin in this species.
A. scabra is known to inhabit a particular "scar" on the subÂ¬
strate to which its shell conforms exactly and to which it
consistently returns (Hewatt, 1940; Test, 1945). The rapid
and uneven marginal growth it exhibits might enable animals
to achieve conformity of the shell to a new spot on the rock
more rapidly. However, shells of A. scabra with slots drilled
in the shell margin showed a slow rate of repair.
SUMMARY
1. Shells of Acmaea scabra, Acmaea digitalis, Acmaea pelta,
Acmaea scutum, and Acmaea limatula found in the field showed
a variety of types of natural damage. Damage through clipping
at the edge of the shell predominated, but shells were found
in which regions near the apex had been crushed; in which the
tops and sides were eroded due to an ascomycete, Didymella
conchae; in which cracks extending from the margin to near
the apex were present; in which the tops were eroded apparently
