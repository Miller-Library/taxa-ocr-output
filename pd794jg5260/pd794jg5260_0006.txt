was floated on a bowl of water and the bowl covered with parafilm.
Nine of the eggs eventually hatched into hexapod larva. No prelarva,
which are found in many species of mites (Krantz 1978), were found. Of
the eggs that did hatch, five did so within threerdays. The larva moved
to the Macrocystis and three days later molted into eight-legged
protonymphs. Although small, the protonymph resembles the adult stage
more closely than the deutonymph. The duration of this stage is not
known, but it lasts at least five days.
Sixteen gravid females collected off wrack were placed in individua
vials containing moist filter paper and a small piece of Macrocystis
blade. Four laid eggs within five days. Dissection of two females
three days after laying showed no sign that a new egg was forming in the
mite.
Distribution of adults and deutonymphs
Initial studies of adult sex ratios gave the percentage of males
as 728 on Orchestoidea and 65% on the wrack. The largest size class of
adult mites had relatively equal numbers of males and females. The
smaller mites, which were much more difficult to sex, tended to possess
exclusively male characteristics. While adult mites of most species
usually don't molt (Krantz 1978), it was observed that old molts from
smaller adult mites were found in vials containing only adult mites.
addition, larger adult mites were observed which had fresh, uncolored
exoskeletons. In subsequent sex ratio studies, only the larger adults
with easily distinguishable sexual characteristics were sexed. While
female counts are relatively easy, it is often difficult to determine
if male mites have undergone their final molt. Females compose 418 of
this population on Orchestoidea and 61% on the wrack.
