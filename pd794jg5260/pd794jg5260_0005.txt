Mite life cycle

Fifty four of 57 G. brevisternalis females from wrack samples had
swollen abdomens. These 54 contained a single, pearl white egg measuring
between 160 by 140 and 220 by 180 microns, nearly a third of the mite's
total body length. Only one egg was found in dissection of 54 females
which were removed from Orchestoidea.
Five hundred ml of wrack with many mites was placed in a jar and
the jar filled to approximately three-fourths capacity with 75% ethanol.
The jar was shaken vigorously about one-fourth of the time for half an
hour. The wrack was removed and the remaining material was swirled and
immediately decanted through a two mm mesh screen into a finger bowl,
leaving most of the sand behind. After the filtrate settled, the upper
liquid layer was siphoned off and the sediment observed under a dissecting
microscope. Approximately 50 eggs were visible. The ratio of eggs tom
females was approximately 2:1, a finding which was approximated in
10 other wrack samples.
Visual examination of another portion of this same wrack sample
revealed only I egg which was found attached to Smithora, an epiphyte
of Phyllospadix. Subsequent visual examination of other wrack samples
shown by the extraction technique to contain mites revealed only two
more eggs, each on Macrocystis.
Rearing eggs
Thirty eggs were extracted from the wrack by the washing method
above
described√©with seawater substituted for ethanol. The eggs were placed
on damp filter paper lining the bottom of a petri dish. A small
(1.5 x 1.5 cm) piece of Macrocystis blade was added to provide food for
any hatching mites. In order to maintain high humidity, the petri dish
