Mite life cycle

15 Alloniscus perconvexus Dana, 1856, were collected from a wrack sample
showing 902 infestation of the 0. corniculata in the wrack. These
Isopods also carried no mites.
Location of eggs
Sixty Orchestoidea, consisting of infested and uninfested amphipods
of both species, were examined visually and found to contain no mite
eggs. Examination of approximately 20 500 ml samples of wrack also showed
no eggs.
In the lab, approximately 80 mites were removed from the Orchestoidea
and divided between two vials containing only a small piece of filter paper
moistened with seawater. It was hoped that the mites would lay eggs on
the filter paper as it was the only substrate provided. No eggs were
observed in a three week period.
The experiment was repeated, but the mites were not removed from
their host in order that they could continue to recieve food. Five 0.
corniculata carrying at least 10 mites each were placed in individual
vials. These vials contained a small piece of glass fiber filter moistened
with seawater which the amphipods did not eat. During the experiment
the amphipods were fed only small pieces of wrack which they immediately
ate. In a two week period no eggs were observed.
In another experiment, eight infested 0. corniculata were placed in
similar vials. Cross sections of Macrocystis stipe were rubbed against
the fiber filter in four of the vials. The amphipods were not fed.
Within two and a half weeks all of the amphipods were dead, apparently
due to starvation. No eggs were laid by the mites and dissection of
24 females showed no sign of egg production.
