Mite life cycle

period could be longer: eggs which were less mature at the time of collection
could be a high proportion of those which did not hatch.
All mites of the suborder Gamasida go directly from a protonymph
to a deutonymph (Krantz 1978). Since both proto- and deutonymphs were
observed, but no unaccounted stage which may come between them, it can
reasonably be assumed that this is the course of the life cycle.
Most Gamasida also go directly form a deutonymph todan adult. As
these are the only two life stages previously described in G. brevisternalis,
and no others have been observed in this study, this appears to be the
course of development.
The deutonymph is the earliest stage which is found on the
Orchestoidea, although it predominately inhabits the wrack. Young adults
are distributed relatively equally between the Orchestoidea and the wrack.
This data indicates that these are the life stages where the transition from
wrack to Orchestoidea occurs.
The wrack seems to induce egg formation in the mites. Only one
female mite on Orchestoidea was ever found to contain an egg. Even mites
observed for two weeks on Orchestoidea produced no eggs. On the other hand,
958 of the females extracted from the wrack were found to contain eggs, a
surprisingly high percentage since it was shown that females which have
just laid an egg do not contain another egg. Possibly females crawl
back to an Orchestoidea immediately after laying.
Fertilization most likely occurs on the wrack. If fertilization
occurred on the Orchestoidea, there would appear to be no reason for the
adult male to leave the amphipod, which is their source of nourishment.
Generally, small parasites experience a low rate of survival to
adulthood which they counter by the production of many eggs. G.
