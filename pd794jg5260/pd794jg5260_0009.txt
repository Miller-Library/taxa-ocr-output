Mite life cycle
page 10
brevisternalis have been observed to drown within half an hour when
submerged, and die of dessication within a few hours when placed on
dry filter paper. Wrack containing all stages of the mite life cycle
can easily be totally dried out or completely submerged by the tides.
Logically, each female would produce many eggs to combat these harsh
conditions and insure that at least two would survive to adulthood.
However, the fact that each female lays one egg at a time and does not
produce another for several days means that these mites actually have
very low fecundity. Apparently they are adapted to their environment
very well.

I'd like to thank Gary Wagenbach of Carlton College for sharing
his knowledge of parasitology. My advisor, Robin Burnett, also has left
me forever indebted by showing the patience to allow me to discover
science for myself. It was an experience l'll never forget.
