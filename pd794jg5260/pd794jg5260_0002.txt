Mite life cycle
Introduction
The higher intertidal zone of the beaches along the east coast of
the Northern Pacific is often inhabited by sandy beach amphipods of the
genus Orchestoidea, commonly known as beach hoppers. They burrow into
the sand during the day and at night forage along the beach for food.
Although omnivores, Orchestoidea prefer to graze on beach wrack composed
fo the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera.
The fact that ectoparasitic mites infest these amphipods was first
documented by Hall (1912), who described a mite which appears to fit the
description of Gammaridacarus brevisternalis Canaris, 1962, as infesting
Orchestoidea californiana Brandt, 1851. Canaris (1962) described adult
males and females and deutonymphs of G. brevisternalis found on 0.
californiana. McClurkin (1953) and Bowers (1964) mention the presence of
mites on the ventral wurface of 0. californiana and 0. corniculata Stout,
1913, during their studies of the amphipods, but conclude the mites had
little effect on their host. Scurlock (1975) reported that the mites are
found attached exclusively to the ventral body surface and the gills of
the Orchestoidea, and that the mites also could be found on decaying beach
wrack.
The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship of
G. brevisternalis to both the Orchestoidea and the beach wrack, and to
document the life cycle of the mite. Until this study, only two of the
six life stages of a typical Gamasida mite (Krantz 1978), the deutonymph
and adult, had been documented for this species. All lab work was done at
