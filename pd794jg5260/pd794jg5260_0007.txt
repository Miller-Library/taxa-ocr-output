Mite life cycle
page 8
Studies of the distribution of young undifferentiated adults
show that they make up nearly equal percentages of the total mite
populations on the wrack (318) and on the Orchestoidea (322). Deutonymphs,
on the other hand, make up 272 of the total mite population on the wrack,
but only six percent on the Orchestoidea.
Discussion
The life cycle of a typical Gamasida mite, the suborder to which
G. brevisternalis belongs, is shown in figure A. Figure B shows the
suggested life cycle of G. brevisternalis. It appears that the female
mite lays a single, large, pearl white egg on the wrack. The requirements
for the wrack are that it be moist and decaying. Being partially buried
will also protect the wrack from drying out. Wrack consisting of a mix
of Macrocystis and Phyllospadix seems to be the wrack with the highest
concentration of mites. This seems logical as Macrocystis is the primary
food of Orchestoidea. Thus the young have easy access to their host
amphipod.
The fact that few eggs were spotted when visually examining wrack
known to contain many eggs tends to suggest that the eggs are tucked into
pockets and folds in the wrack. While protection from predation may be
one benefit of such strategy, the primary benefit is likely that it prevents
dessication of the eggs.
In a random sample of eggs, one would expect that after half the
incubation period has passed, half of the eggs would be hatched. Approximately
one-half of the eggs which hatched did so two to three days after collection
indicating an incubation period of five to six days. However, given that
only about one third of the eggs collected actually hatched, the incubation
