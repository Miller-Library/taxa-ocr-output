Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California.
Collections were made at the Monterey Boat Works and West Beaches of Hopkins
Marine Station and Asilomar Beach, Pacific Grove. Amphipods were
identified using the field key of Bowers (1963).
Location of mite habitat
Three methods were used to determine the presence of mites in various
substrates. The first was simply a visual inspection of the substrates.
The second technique was to release mite-free Orchestoidea in the substnate.
G. brevisternalis is known to actively seek a host Orchestoidea (Scurlock
1975). Thus the Orchestoidea should become infested if mites are present.
The final method of detection involved placing the substrate in a Berlese
funnel and driving the mites down into a collection jar containing either
moist filter paper, for live collection, or 75% ethanol.
Neither of the first two methods yielded mites with a wide variety
of sand as the substrate. Sand was not placed in the Berlese funnel as
it fell into the collection jar. All three methods produced mites when
beach wrack was used as the substrate. Use of the Berlese apparatus
with ethanol in the collection chamber was the best method of locating
mite concentrations. Mites were most commonly found on partially buried
wrack above the mean high tide line consisted; primarily of seagrass and
kelp of the genera Phyllospadix and Macrocystis, respectively. They
preferred moist decaying wrack. Wrack with a high concentration of mites
might contain up to 100 mites per liter. Wrack which was older and very
decayed contained few, if any, mites.
Pill bugs and isopods were also examined for mites. Examination of
10 Amardilidium vulgare Latreille, 1804, collected near a beach where
the infestation rate among 0. corniculata was 85% showed no mites. Also
