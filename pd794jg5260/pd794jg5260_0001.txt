Mite life cycle
page 2
Abstract
The life cycle of Gammaridacarus brevisternalis is documented for
first time. The life cycle appears to follow that of a typical Gamasida
mite with two exceptions: it skips the prelarva stage and appears to
undergo an adult molt. The life cycle is divided between beach wrack
and beach amphipods of the genus Orchestoidea. Only the deutonymphs
and adults are found on Orchestoidea. Gravid femalis are found almost
exclusively on beach wrack. It appears that the wrack somehow induces
fertility in the mites.
