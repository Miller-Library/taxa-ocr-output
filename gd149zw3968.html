ABSTRACT
The blood glucose concentration of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cryptochiton stelleri : Exact'>Cryptochiton stelleri</span>
was found to be 3.5 + 2.0 mgs with no significant difference
between the sexes. The chitons were observed to rapidly
counteract increases in their blood sugar brought about by
glucose injection. In an attempt to elucidate the regulatory
mechanism involved in maintaining Cryptochiton's relatively
constant blood sugar concentration, the effect of infusing
vertebrate insulin, norepinephrine, and serotonin was
monitored. None of the hormones used appeared to have any
affect on the chiton's blood sugar concentration.

INTRODUCTION
Several investigators have found indications of
regulation of the blood glucose levels of mollusks
(Martin, 1966; Goddard, 1969). Although the concentration
of glucose in the blood of Cryptochiton stelleri
(Middendorff, 1846) has been measured (Myers, 1920; Tucker
and Giese, 1962), the ability of this species to regulate
has not been examined. Its large size permits serial
sampling of blood, and in view of this, studies were
undertaken on Cryptochiton stelleri in the Spring of
1974 at Hopkins Marine Station, first to determine the
normal glucose concentration in the blood, and then to
seek evidence for any regulatory mechanism. The results
clearly indicate a regulating response opposing changes
in the blood glucose concentration,
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Cryptochiton stelleri, ranging in size from 700 to
1500 g, were collected subtidally from the kelp beds just
off Mussel Point in Monterey Bay, California and kept in
large sea water tank at 13.5°C for one to two weeks before
use.
A single polyethylene catheter (PE 60) was placed in
each animal 12 to 24 hours before initiation of the experiment
and subsequent samples and injections were made through the
page 2
Philip F. Michael
Blood glucose in <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Cryptochiton : PartialExact'>Cryptochiton
catheter.</span> The catheter was inserted according to the
method of Martin et al. (1958), either dorsally between
the seventh and eighth valves into the haemocoel, or just
ventral to and between the fourth and fifth valves into
the pericardial cavity or lateral sinus. Some difficulty
was encountered in locating the catheter in the exact
desired position. Danger of puncturing the heart or missing
the lateral sinus, for example, could not be avoided and
could only be accounted for after each experiment when the
animals were dissected to determine sex and catheter
position.
Blood samples were analyzed for glucose aoncentrations
by the Glucostat method (Worthington Biochemicals Corp.).
an enzyme system specific for D-glucose. Analysis was
performed on 0.3 ml samples diluted with 0.7 ml of H»O and
with 0.5 ml each of 1.8% Ba (OH),-8H90 and 2.0% Zn (SOA):7H,O.
Total reducing power was determined on the deproteinized
blood by the method of Nelson and Somogyi (Hawk et al., 1954).
RESULTS
(a) Normal Blood Sugar Level
D-glucose concentrations in the blood of twenty-five
— thirteen males, nine females, and five of
Cryptochito
unknown sex — were determined during the month of May.

Blood glucose in Cryptochiton
Although the chitons were grouped by sex, no significant
difference was found between the glucose concentrations
of males and females (P£ 0.1 Student's T-test).
The results are summarized in Figure 1. One male
(glucose concentration of 35.6 mg%) differed so widely
from the mean that it was not included in calculating the
mean.
Twelve of the chitons were sampled two or three times
at intervals from one to twenty-hour hours and were found
to maintain reasonably constant blood glucose concentrations.
The average of the standard deviations for all these animals
was 0.6 mg%, and the largest standard deviation was 1.4 mg%.
Blood samples for three of the Cryptochitons were also
assayed for total reducing power, yielding values from
0.1 mg% above to 2.0 mg% below those for D-glucose,
essentially equal within experimental error. Therefore,
glucose is the major reducing component in the blood.
(b) Glucose Injection
Glucose solution (400 mg/ml) was injected directly
into the blood of six Cryptochitons in a doee of 311 mg/kg.
This quantity is sufficient to raise the blood glucose level
by 75 mg% on the basis of the blood volume reported by
Martin et al. (1958).
Blood sugar concentrations, before and after injection,
were measured in serial samples taken from each chiton.

The results are summarized in Figure 2. The high initial
glucose values and the wide variation in the rate of the
response of the chitons was probably due to a lack of good
mixing since it was not always possible to place the
collecting catheter in a position of good circulation.
However, despite the variation, in each case the blood
glucose level clearly returned to a point well below that
expected from mere establishment of a passive equilibrium.
The blood of chitons 1, 2, and 3 returned to virtually
normal glucose concentrations, and it is expected that
chitons 4, 5, and 6 would have also had the experiment
been prolonged. No evident difference appeared.between
the chitons with the catheter in the haemocoel and those
with it in the pericardial cavity.
The water surrounding chitons 1, 2, 3, and 4 which
were kept in closed containers, was also tested for glucose
and, in all cases, less than 10% of the original glucose
injection was found in the water. Thus, decrease in blood
glucose could not have been due to excretion of glucose.
(c) Insulin Injection
Four Cryptochitons were injected with large doses of
insulin six hours after injection with glucose as described
in the pervious section. Two animals received a 20 units/kg
dose of insulin solution (13 units/ml) and two received a
page 5
Philip F. Michael
Blood glucose in Cryptochitons
200 units/kg dose of a more concentrated insulin solution
(130 units/ml). The insulin used was Calbiochem bovine
pancreas insulin, recrystallized and assayed at 25.9 units/mg.
Figure 3 summarizes the results and indicates that the
insulin had no noticeable effect on the blood glucose level.
It did not increase the rate of fall of the blood glucose
concentration.
The lower glucose values for the two chitons sampled
in the lateral sinus probably result from good circulation
there which insures rapid mixing. In light of this result.
it might be advantageous in all similar future experiments
with Cryptochitons to use the lateral sinus for,injection
and sampling.
(d) Norepinephrine and Serotonin Injection
Norepinephrine and serotonin, each injected into four
Cryptochitons in doses of 1 mg/kg (1 mg/ml solution).
were found to cause no significant changes in blood glucose
concentrations during four to five hours after injection.
DISCUSSION
Blood sugar concentrations in Cryptochiton stelleri
have been observed by Myers (1920) who reported a value
of 41 mg%, and by Tucker and Giese (1962) who found
page 6

Sugar glucose in Cryptochitons
concentrations from 3.7 to 11.7 mg%, with the lowest
values recorded in the Spring. The present study confirms
Tucker's very low spring glucose concentrations and, in
addition, indicates that the blood sugar level is quite
constant, both among members of the population and within
each individual. Martin (1966) notes a general constancy
in the blood sugar levels of other mollusks also.
A low blood glucose level probably is of adaptive
advantage to the chiton, since, as Martin (1966) notes,
most mollusks filter their blood for ufine production and
must then actively reabsorb any sugar present. However,
the very low supply of blood sugar also presents Cryptochiton
with the problem of adequately meeting its energy requirements,
since it does not appear to have a significant concentration
of any other reducing compound in its blood. The chiton
is often observed to exist long periods without eating,
so it must be able to mobilize energy stores, such as
glycogen, to maintain an adequate blood sugar concentration.
Itseems likely, especially considering the great stability
found in the sugar levels, that Cryptochiton possesses
some mechanism of active regulation to accomplish that
purpose.
To indicate further the existence of any regulating
mechanism, the response of the chiton to artificially
increased blood glucose levels was measured. It was
observed, as expected if Cryptochiton does indeed regulate
page 7

that the sugar concentration rapidly returned toward a
level near the original value without significant loss
of glucose to the surroundings. The glucose might well
have been deposited as glycogen for storage since Tucker
and Giese (1962) have found significant amounts of glycogen
present in the chiton. Barry and Munday (1959) have noted
a similar phenomenon of apparent regulation in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Patella vulgata : Exact'>Patella
vulgata</span> (Linnaeus, 1849).
Although regulation of blood glucose in Cryptochiton
has not been studied previously, evidence for a possible
mechanism of sugar regulation has been sought actively
in other mollusks. Goddard (1969) has obtained the most
interesting results, having induced both hyperglycaemia
and hypoglycaemia in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Octopus dofleini : Exact'>Octopus dofleini</span> (Pickford, 1964)
with tissue extracts. Although the precise interpretation
of his results is somewhat unclear they provide a definite
indication that some functional hormonal control system
may be active within the mollusk for glucose regulation.
In addition, most of the vertebrate sugar-regulating
amines have been found in the mollusks. Many investigators
have tried, with mixed success, to record an effect of
those hormones, as well as insulin and glucagon, on the
sugar levels of mollusk blood.
Goddard (1968) and Kasinothan (1963) reported a
questionable hypoglycaemic effect of mammalian insulin
on Octopus dofleini and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Meretrix casta : Exact'>Meretrix casta</span> (Chemnitz),

respectively, However, such large dosages were required
that insulin probably plays a small role in any actual
regulating mechanism they might possess. The present
study indicates that even large doses of insulin have no
observable effect on the blood sugar concentration of
Cryptochiton.
Goddard (1968) found no effect from norepinephrine
or serotonin on blood glucose of Octopus dofleini.
However, Tiffon (1967) has elicited a rise in glucose
concentration upon injection of serotonin into the haemocoel
of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Achatina fulica : Exact'>Achatina fulica</span> (Bowdich, 1822). The present study
indicates that neither norepinephrine norserotonin has
any effect on Cryptochiton blood sugar levels, at least
within five hours after injection.
The research reported here provides strong evidence
that a form of carbohydrate regulation exists in Cryptochiton
stelleri. However, much more work is needed to strengthen
these results and provide insight into the actual mechanism
of such regulation. Studies might include monitoring the
glycogen content after glucose injection as well as the
effects of molluscan tissue extracts.
