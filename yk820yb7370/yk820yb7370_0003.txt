1.ammonia - 2 ml. of the sample used without preliminary
treatment.
2. urea - 1 ml. of sample, ldrop of urease buffer solution,
and distilled water to make a total volume of 2 ml., and
incubation for one hour.
3. allantoic acid - 1 ml. of sample heated with o.1 ml. of
0.1 N HCl in a boiling water for 2 minutes, cooled,
neutralized with O.1 ml. O.1 N NaoH and treated as described
for urea above.
4. allantoin - 1 ml. sample heated with O.1 ml. O.ool N NaoH
in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, followed by treatment
described above for allantoic acid. (Fosse, 1929; Bossen,1937;
Debeaumont, 1947)
All of the above were compared to a standard curve
prepared using (NH.)2
Uric acid was determined by the method of Folin (1930)
The Klett-Summerson colorimeter with a green filter was
used for measurements.
Uric acid, xanthine, and guanine were determined by
the Lowery modification of the Folin reaction used for
the estimation of proteins (Lowery et al,1951).
Enzyme assays: The enzyme solution pH 7.4 phosphate
buffer homogenate of 4 P. granosimanus hepatopancreases
in 8 ml. of buffer, which was centrifuged to remove cellular
debris. The subtrate solutions were adjusted to contain
70 ug of N per aliquot after deproteinization. O.5 ml.
enzyme soluttion, 1.0 ml. substrate solution, and 0.5 ml. pH 7.4
phosphate buffer were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.
