of hepatopancrease
Preliminary work using a homogenate from Pagurus
granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859) appeared to show the presence
of the enzymes capable of degrading purines. This work
was undertaken to confirm these observations and to
detect the enzymes present in the following hypothetical
sequence:
xanthine -anthine oxidase
uricase allantoin -allantoinase a lantoic acid
allantoicase ure urease amonie
Included in this is a search for enzymes that would
allow the introduction into the sequence of adenine and
guanine.
PROCEDURE
Colormetric determination of the intermediates in the
enzyme sequence were used to detect activity.
Ammonia, urea, allantoic acid, and allantoin were
measured with or without preliminary treatment by the
detenmination of NH, through Nesslerization. 3 ml. of
Nessler's reagent was added to 2 ml. sample, incubated
for 30 minutes, and the resulting yellow color read in the
Klett-Summerson colorimeter with a blue filter. Preliminary
treatment was as follows:
