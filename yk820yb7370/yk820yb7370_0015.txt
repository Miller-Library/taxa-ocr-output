Figure 4 demonstrates P.samuelis over the time interval for death
when exposed (Table III) should have lost between 31.5 and 45.06
of its body weight as water. Although they did extrude free water
when exposed,these losses are still much higher than the observed
desiccation death values. Since P.samuelis can maintain lower shell
temperatures, probably by water evaporation, and its body temperature
at death is far below the lethal water temperature, I feel P.samuelis
died from desiccation while maintaining lower body'and shell
temperatures by means of the behavioral response previously described.
Therefore by testing the effects of physical factors, I can
suggest how P.samuelis is better adapted to withstand more extreme
conditions encountered higher within the intertiial zone, but not
why it inhabits this area. P.samuelis as compared to P.granosimanus
can tolerate higher water temperatures possibly encountered in high
exposed tidepools. When exposed to the sun within the shell,
P.granosimanus appears to die mainly from high temperatures,and it
is this harmful factor against which P.samuelis seems adapted.
Temperature control supersedes water conservation, necessitates the
ability to withstand greater desiccation and elicits the evolution
of a behavioral temperature-controlling response.
