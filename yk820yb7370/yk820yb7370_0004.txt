The reactions were stopped by deproteinization using tungstic
acid; 1 ml. of reaction mixture was added to 9 ml. of a
mixture of 10% sodium tungstate and 1/12 N H,S04, 1:8.
Enzyme and substrate controls were sampled in an identical
manner.
No enzyme activity for the substrates adenine,
guanine, xanthine, uric acid, allantoin, allantoic acid,
and urea was detected.
Due to difficulties encountered in direct Nesslerization
a set of assays were also prepared using distillation of
ammonia prior to Nesslerization. No conversion of xanthine,
uric acid, allantoin, allantoic acid, or urea to ammonia
was demonstrated, nor was the conversion demonstrable upon
the addition of jack bean urease to the reaction mixtures
containing the first four substrates.
In a three hour test with samples taken every half
hour, no conversion of xanthine to uric acid was demonstrable.
DI SCUSSION
According to Waterman (1960) crustaceans have
been shown to have the hypothetical enzyme sequence
from xanthine to ammonia. As no enzyme activity was
demonatrable in the hepatopancreas, further work on
other tissues of the Pagurus could be undertaken to
find the source of these enzymes.
