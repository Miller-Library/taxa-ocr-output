Summary
1. Tests were performed on P.samuelis and P.granosimanus to
determine the effects of temperature and desiccation.
2. P.samuelis can tolerate higher water temperature than P.granosimanus
with P. samuelis lethal temperature at 31.5°0. ani P.granosimanus 29.700
3. Shell temperature measurements on exposure to sunlight showed tat
P.samuelis maintained a lower shell temperature longer an possessed
an a parent behavioral response for controlling temperature. (In
response to increase temperature the animal woul' aparently air
the shell by walking and then withiraw deep into its interior, thereby
lowering the shell temperature.)
4. Böth species lie at 45-65 minutes out of the shell when exposed to
the sun with P.samuelis body temperature at death higher taan P.
granosiranus.
5. When exposed within the shell P.sawuelis livei longer ani ha
a lower body temperature at jeath than P.granosimanus.
6. P.samuelis loses more water ani faster than P.granosimanus both
in an' out of the shell, but te former can lose about 27.05 (mean
value) of its body weiwht as water before death, the latter oly
18.33 (mean value). In both species males can tolerate the least
loss, then females; females with egges tolerate the greatest loss.
7. Generally P.samuelis is adapted to a higher position in the
intertidal zone due to its ability to withstan' an' control temperature.
