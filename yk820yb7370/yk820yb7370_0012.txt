The behavioral responses of P. granosimanus seem to correlate
with those observed during the shell temperature experiment, as 2
of the 16 crabs vacated their shells, and the rest seemed to die
hanging  to of their body out of the shell. However only one
third of the P.samuelis individuals vacated the shell while the rest
withdrew tightly into its interior. This suggests the 80% exit in
the shell temperature experiment was higher than normal,and probably
due to the probe obstructing the animals complete withdrawal into
the shell.
It is surprising that P.samuelis which occupies a higher inter-
tidal zone than P, granosimanus should lose more water and faster,
(Figure 4ap;5) especially since other crabs living higher in the inter-
tidal have acquired the ability to tolerate exposure. (Pearse 1929) This
problem appears resolved when the walues for percent of desiccation
(Table VÃ¦VI) before death were determined. Clearly P.samuelis can
withstand a greater water loss than P.granosimanus. Within each
species the trend in amount lost goes from male, withstanding the
least, to female, and then gravid females, withsta ding the greatest
loss. The experiment of removing toe females' eggs demonstrated they
still lost the greatest amount of water before death, which suggests
a physiological change within the gravid hermit crab. The relation
between weight an' water lost before death within each species generally
suggests that the larger animals can tolerate a lower percentage
of weight lost as water than the smaller. This correlates with the
casual observation that the larger crabs are lower in the intertidal
zone.

If desiccation death results from loss of body water theg might
