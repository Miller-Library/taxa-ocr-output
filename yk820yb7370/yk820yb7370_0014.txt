Discussion
I feel the foregoing data can be correlated by a theoretical
anal
wott
explanation for the causes of death when exposed out of the shell
and within it. When exposed out of the shell both species died
between 45 and 65 minutes with P.samuelis having a higher body
temperature. As shown in Figure 5 the amount of body water lost at
the time of death of P.granosimanus would be 14-19.5% and that of
P.samuelis 16-21.54. As Table VI shows, the percent water lost before
death for P.granosimanus is about the same as the amount lost in
this time interval. This suggests P.granosimanus is dying from water
loss, and its low temperature could be due to water evaporation.
P.samuelis, although losing water faster (according to Table 7) has
not lost enough water to cause death. This sugrests the crabs are
dying from limited water loss combined with high temperature (as
indicated by their higher body temperatures).
However hermit crabs are almost never observed exposed outside
their shells within the intertidal zone. Table IV shows that P.samuelis
within the shell lives longer and has a lower body temperature at
death than P.granosimanus. Interpolating from Figure 4 in the time
interval till death P.ganosimanus should hawe lost 21.5-22.0% of
its water. These high values woul' suggest lesiccation as the killer,
but initially each crab stores within the shell free water which it
extrudes when exoosed. Therefore much of this weight loss results
from extruded water, and I seriously doubt the animal has lost enough
water to cause death. Thus I would attribute de th mostly to
higher temperatures, (as indicated by its body temperature) combined
with limite water loss.
