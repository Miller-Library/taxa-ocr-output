MATERIALS and METHODS
The MBARI's ROV had video taped 46 dives in the Monterey Canyon
between the dates of March 20,1989, and May 13, 1991. These were used
to provide data for this study of the symbiotic relationship of a deep sea
i
Jecapod and anemone. The eleven signts and their locations are as follows:
North wall (36 degrees 48' 30“ N, 122 degrees 5' 20“ W), Soquel Canyon (36
rees 49' N, 121 degrees 59' W), Meander (36 degrees 43' 06“ N, 121

decrees 9 30 W), Monterey Canyon Head, Canyon Wall C4-C5 (36 degrees
42' H, 122 degrees 00' W), Anthomastus Ridge, Point Joe (36 degrees 36
45"N, 122 degrees 00 15" W), Carmel Bay (36 degrees 32.2'N, 122
er
egrees 58' 00" W), Cypress Point (36 degrees 42' N, 122 degrees 00' w),
and Point Lobos.
The videotapes are annotated and entered in the data base with
physical factors and navigational data. The video footage of crab and
anemone interactions from the 46 dives was reviewed and the depth of
each sighting was noted. Lynn Lewis of MBARI provided data regarding the
depth and the time spent on the canyon wall during each of these dives. By
watching the tapes, it was determined if a crab was visible, the position
of the crab, and any interaction which may tell more about the relationship
je crab and anemone. The crabs are often covered with sediment
betweent
ze than their coelentarate hosts, and thus are not
and are smaller in:

particularily the dive on May 6, 1991, provided most of the data pertaining
to the symbiotic relationship of the Chorilia crab and Corallimorph.
The data base was also searched to provide information about every
crab sighted during the 46 dives to learn of its other associations. It was
