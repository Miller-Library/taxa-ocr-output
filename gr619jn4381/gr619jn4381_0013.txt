Symbiotic Relationship.
The percentages of corallimorphs seen with crabs emphasizes their
strong symbiotic relationship. The overall value of 818 corallimorphs
viewed with Chorilia is probably a low estimate. The crabs can hide under
the tentacles of the anemones, and make it difficult to determine whether
a crab is actually present. It was interesting to note that no crabs were
seen at Soquel Canyon, although only four corallimorph were viewed
closely, it is possible that Chorilia do not inhabitat that area of the
canyon.
Cherilia were occasonally seen with other host organisms including
four cerianthids, one folded sponge, two under duster anemones, three

under Anthomastus, one shaggy sponge, and a few hexactinellid sponget
The crabs were well hidden, which supports a hypothe
sis that protection
fror predators is one of the reasons for the symbiosis. Smaller crabs
were seen on the Anthomastus suggesting that the younger crabs may find
hosts other than the corallimorphs until further development. The
smallest crab in the aquaria was unable to climb off a corallimorph when
set on its tentacles, the corallimorphs in the wild may have the capability
of capturing small crabs for consumption.
Beproductive Activity of the Corallimorph:
The corallimorph which appears dividing at a deep furrow through
ne mouth suggests that these organisms can divide asexually. They were
so seen in chains decreasing in size, as though new organisms had bud
om a barent. The footage of a corallimorph releasing gametes or
larvae sugdests sexual reproduction.
issogiation seen in captivity and in the wild
Behavioral observations made in the aquar ia resembled scenes in the
deo footade. Chorilia did not appear to exhibit any modified behavior
