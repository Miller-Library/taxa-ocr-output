acles would appear full rather than shriveled. Food was moved closer
to the roouth and taken into the oral cavity, but regurgitated food was
frequently found at the bottom of the tank. The anemone did not exhibit a
feeding response to live brine shrimp. The shrimp would stick to the
tentacles, but would frequently swim away. A corallimorph would fold a
tentacle over a shrimp, but it did not bring the prey towards its mouth, or
crack open its mouth.
The crabs have been seen feeding on both the large and small krill.
They would remove pieces from the rock and occasionally from an
amemone. The crabs swung their claws to catch the swimming shrimp, and
they ate shrimp that stuck to their carapace and legs.
