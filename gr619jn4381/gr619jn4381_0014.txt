caused by their new environment. Unfortunately, the corallimorphs have
not fared so well in captivity. Two of the corallimorphs observed during
this study resembled those in the wild; their tentacles were full and
extended gracefully. Tentacles of the third anemone were stubby and


bal ely extended off its race, other corallimorphs in captivity in the
onterey Bay Aquar iurn's deep sea tanks have a shriveled appearance


bert Van Dykhuizen suggested that the corallimorphs have not been
diven an apppropriate diet. The regurgitated food sugge
ts that the
anemones are either overfed, or are starving by not digesting the food.
Further research of these symbionts should first include determination of


edieto
e corallimorphs, under standing their diet may help maintain
these organisms in captivity, or could suggest that other factors have
caused their decrease in size.
Feeding
Crabs were seen taking food out of the mouth of a corallimorph on
tape and in a tank, and thereby benefiting from a free meal. Small
particles and occasional larger prey can be caught by the sticky mucus and
stinging nematocysts of an anemone's tentacles; the crabs have shown that
hey are interested and can feed off the food of these corallimorphs. This
may support a hypothesis that food gives the crab another benefit from a

All three female crabs released zoea between the dates May 10 and

May 16, 1991. Two caus were collected from Monterey bay on May 6
1991. The third crab to release her larvae was in captivity for over a
month, therefore it appears that captivity has not interfered with the
normal reproductive cycle.
Zoea maintained in a tank with a constant water current survived
