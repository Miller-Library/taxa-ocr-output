for aminimum of 21 days. Drawings of larvae show five segments of the
abdornen and then the telson. The four leg appendages had four setae each
throuahout the observation time. Counting the setae is a method used to
stade brachyuran zoeae, additional setae would be expected to develop,
but were not seen on the specimens observed. The shortening of the dorsal
pine may be evidence that some of the larvae were developing.
Toea larvae feed on planktonic organisms. (Warner,136) Positive
phototaxis may direct the larvae up towards this food source. The three to
five day old zoea were attracted to the light shined on the tank. They
sensed the direction of the light and were most concentrated in grid
squares at and below the source. When they swam to the light, it appeared
that they hit the side of the tank then fell to the floor, but when light wat
shined at the surface of the water, they swam up to it and then descended.
The arids in Figure..*show that when the light was shined in an upper
square, the concentration of larvae is high in the entire column. When
licht was shined at a bottom square, the concentration was highest at the
lowest square, but was decreased up above. Warner (1977) states that the
direction of swimming seems to involve responses to both light and
gravity

Chorilia longipes and Corallimorphus appear to inhabit a common
depthrange and pattern of distribution, and eighty percent of the
corallimorphs are hosts to crabs. Of the 101 Chorilia sighted, 89 were
seen with corallimorphs and four were seen with cerianthids. This may
