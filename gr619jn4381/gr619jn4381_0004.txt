associations with the crab, and the depth range of the three species was

Scarprerphs were observed at the Monterey Bay Aquar ium's research
tenter. Two crabs and two corallimorphs were held for 35 days, one
anerone and four crabs were collected May 6, 1991, and were held for 22

the larvae were made using a camera lucida. Newly hatched larvae were
oiaced on the tentacles of the anemone to determine if the anemone stung
he larvae. A compound microscope was used to view larvae at 1000x in
searchof the stinging nematocyst cells of the anemone.
Atest to determine photreceptivity of the larvae was conducted on
the second. third, and fourth days after one of the female crabs began to

rock. the larvae she had released were contained in this tub by a thin
filter. Light was shined with a flashlight onto one 1" square for one
