53 corallimorphs observed at C4-CS had crabs in association; 41 had one
rab visible, and 13 had two crabs visible. Eight of the twelve
corallimorphs at North wall were associated with crabs, and 1002 of the
corallimorphs seen at the other three sights had one or two crabs.

Fidure J shows th
t 0 of the corallimorphs viewed had one crab
visibie, 17.37 had 2 crabs visible, and 18.9% had no crabs visible. Thus,
overall 31.17 of the ninety corallimorphs viewed closely had crabs in
sociation.
Chorilia were seen with other coelentarate hosts. At C4-C5, three
cr√§bs were seen under cerianthids, two under duster anemones (Liponema),
+
two under Alliiomastus, and one in a shaggy sponge. At Point Joe, one
Chorilia was seen in association with a cerianthid and another was seen in
a folded sponge. One Chorilia at Anthomastus ridge was seen with an
Anthomastus
Beproductive Activity of the Corallimorph
Corallimorphs were seen in strings of graded sizes suggesting they
might result from asexual reproduction. On footage at time code

10/26789/11, 00.29.45.00, a corallimorph of about 5 inches in diameter
abbeared to be dividing in half- the split occured at the mouth. Gilbert van
ne Monterey Bay Aquar ium has some observat ion suggesting
Dyhheusenatt
incibient asexual reproduction in captive anemones.
Footage from 05/06/91/07, 02.19.15.00, shows a corallimorph
eleasing gametes or larvae out of its mouth. The epidermis of the
corallimorph is a transparent enough to observe the ripe gonads. The
gonads were seen in bands associated with the margins of mesentaries.
Association in captivity and in the wild
Video footage and observations in the aquaria showed crabs situated
close to the anemone. There were two common positions of Chorilia
