On a Floss Landing dive in October 1990, five to ten Chorilia were collected
in hexactinellid sponges while dredging at 650 meter.

Corallimorphs were commonly seen at North Wall, Soquel Canyon,
the Meander sites, C4-C5, Anthomastus Ridge. There was only one seen on
de wall at Point Joe. Corallimorphs were not seen at Point Lobos, the
Monterey Canyon Head, Cypress Point or the Kelp study sites of Point Joe

he greatest populations of corallimorphs were seen at C4-C5 and
Morth wall. Footage from tapes 10/26/89/11 and 10/26/89/12 show a
patch of approximately 216 anemones between the depths of 351.430 and

was disthictly different from other sightings. Table 5 compares number
of solitary anerones to the number of anemones which appeared to be
clonal, all anemones seen at the North wall patch were listed with the
clonal anerone.

Cerianthids were seen all sites except at Cypress Point. Ninty-five
cerianthids were seen at the Pt. Joe site compared to only two
sorallimerphs. They were not seen at depths beyond 434.040 m.
