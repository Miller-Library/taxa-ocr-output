The submersible ROV of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute provided video footage of crab-anemone interactions and was
used to document a symbiotic relationship. Chorilia longipes and

++.

Lorannnorpnde appear to innavit a common depurt range and pattern of
distribution in the Monterey Canyon, and 818 of the corallimorphs veiwed
were hosts to crabs. Chorilia longipes were found between 298 meters
and 650 meters, and the corallimorph was seen between the depths of 306
and 506 meters. The corallimorph appeared in highest concentration at
North Wall and were virtually absent south of Point Joe. Video
vations suggest that corallimorph reproduce
b
both asexually and
sexually Ihe crabs gains food and possible protection from their host
anemones, and thus the relationship may be best desribed as
commensalism.
