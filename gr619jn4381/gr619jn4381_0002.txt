INTRODUCTION
Many symbiotic partnerships have been described for species of
fish, shrimp, and crabs with
sea anemones. Many case
in tropical coral
reeis have been reported, including studies of an inachid crab with an

imity for an anernone (Diesel, 1988, Weinbauer, Nussbaumer, Patzper,
1981), and an anemone which attaches to the shell of a hermit crab
(Brooks, 1988). Small amphiprian fishes studied in the South Pacific and
ian Oceans of a size to be considered prey of tropical sea anemones, but
somehow acclimate to their host's nemotocysts (Mariscal, 1966). Studjes
of symbionts in the temperate coastal seas are rarer, but some
relatioriships have been documented. A small benthic fish may be found
resting on Corynactis (Miller, 1989) and hermit crabs (Broughton, 1975;
Tates, 1980) of Montery Bay have been observed in association with
+-
pleura However, nothing has been reported on deep sea benthic
syrbionts. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) studies
the fauna on the Monterey canyon wall using a submersible Remotely
Operated Vehicle (ROV), and thereby provided a data base for the study of a
leep sea decapod associated with an anemone host.
This study investigates the depth range, pattern of distribution, and
occurance of the symbiotic relationship of the corallimorph anemone and a
smaller spider crab in the Monterey Canyon. Video footage provides the
opportunity to study these symbionts in their natural habitat, and to make
comparisons with observations in captivity. The purpose of this study was
erunder
ain ab
tanding of the nature of these deep sea organisms

and their interactive relationship.
