the ROV. The crab collected at 650 metero positioned itself under a
corallirorph within 15 minutes. The larger tether of the ROV will soon
bermit establishmnet of the lower depth range of the anemone and crab.

n of Distribution
a

Coraimorphs were seen in greatest abundance at North Wall. They
were also sighted at Soquel Canyon, the Meander site, Anthomastus Ridge,
and Ca-C5 Corallimorphs were rare or absent from Pt. Joe and south. The
reatest concentration was seen at the North Wall where many
corallimorphs appeared to be clonal, moving south to C4-C5 and
thornastus Ridge, most corallimorphs sighted were solitary. Only one
corallimorph was sighted at Pt. Joe, and none were seen further south.
Corallimorphs were not sighted at the shallower depths studied at
the Monterey Canyon head. At Pt. Joe and Carmel Bay, corallimorphs were
not seen on the level sites of the Kelp study dives. This follows the
battern of nearly no corallimorphs south of Pt. Joe, but it may also suggest

mat die corallimorphs prefer the rocky sloped habitat of the canyon wall.
The dive at Pt. Lobos was shallower than the upper depth range of the
corallirorph, but Cypress Point was viewed within the appropriate range
and none were seen. Further study using transects of the different dives
tes may aive more insight on the possible significance of this

ssure, or rutrients, as well as reproductive capabilities,
may contribute to a patchy distribution.
Cerianthids were seen at all sights except Cypress Point. They were
found in abundance on the canyon floors of Pt. Joe and Carmel Bay. These
tube dwelling coelentarates appear to find the both the sloped rocky walls
and smoother floors as suitable habitats. Again, it would be beneficial to
make a more detailed analysis of the significance of their distribution in
he Monterey Bay Canyon.
