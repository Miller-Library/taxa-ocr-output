RESULTS
dentification
Daphne Fout in of the University of Kansas suggested that the
raoroh anemone may be one of two species of the genus
Sora
Lorallimertrus reported in the South Pacific, both Corallimorphus rigidus
-
and Corailimorphus profundus have been described from preserved
material. Four rows of tentacles were counted on the specimens in
--...
captivity, thus there is reason to believe this is the species
Corallimorphus profundus which has been described as having tentacles in
cycles of four.
The spider crab was identified as Chorilia longipes with the key and
description provided in Marine Decapods of California (Schmitt, 1921).
The crab and anemone are conf ident ly recognized in video images when
inspected closely.
Sov Observation
Archival video tapes from Monterey Canyon sites were viewed for a
total 57Ol minutes and the total depth range analyzed was 31 meters to
511 meters. Table I lists the dive sites, the time spent on the canyon
wall, and the minimum and maximum depths viewed on each dive.
During the 8701 minutes on the canyon wall, 386 corallimorphs and
â€”-
ds were sighted. Table 2 lists the numbers of these
terar
enfarates from each site, and a calculation of the number of organisms
en.
seen per minute.
Depth ranges.
Table J lists the depth ranges for each organism. The corallimorphs
were found within the depth range of 307 meters and 506 meters. The
cerianthids were found within a shallower depth range of 67 meters and
