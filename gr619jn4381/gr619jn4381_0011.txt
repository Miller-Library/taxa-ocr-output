Larvae
The three crabs released their larvae between the dates of May 10
and May 16. One crab was observed leaning back, balanced on her four hind
eds. Her front two legs were reached up and outward and the other pair
were extended out to her sides. Her front legs were seen touching the edge
of the corallimorph, and her claws were folded down. She raised her
abdomen to contract the egg sac and O,1,2, or 3 larvae were seen to come
out at the top. The carapace of the newly hatched zoea was approximately
one millimeter, with an abdomen of about one mm in length.
The crabs pumped eggs out of their egg sacs for three to five days.
Drawings were made of the surviving larvae on several days after
1-- -
natching. After two weeks, the dorsal spine on surviving larvae, shortened

inendt
h. Notable characteristics and measurements are included on the
drawings (Figures 3 and 4). The larvae stuck to the tentacles of the
anerone, but like the brine shrimp, were not injested.
Test for photo receptivity showed that the larvae are attracted to
light. Zoea were most concentrated in grid squares where light is shined
(Figure 5). Larvae swam toward the light then dropped down.

Corallimoruh (307 m to 506m). The crabs collected at 650 meters give
proof that Cherilia lives deeper than the 511 meter maxium dive made by
