duration pulses evoke a short term phasic response, although
the time relations differe slightly.
3. Steady D.C. of polarity opposite to the aboye
yields a longer tonic contraction.
4. Both the tonic and the phasic responses will summate.
but only in the phasic mode will the muscle sustain a state
of tetanus.
5. The tonic response is hypothetically attributed to
membrane hyperpolarization and subsequent ca influx, and
as such probably does not occur in vivo.
