Fig. 1A-E. A composite of isometric responses of somatic
muscle preparations from Cryptochiton stelleri, horizontal
axis in 10 sec. intervals. A--phasic responses to 2 sec.
D.C. stimuli, voltages indicated. B--tonic waveforms
elicited by 5 sec. stimuli of 5 volts, polarity reversed from
A. C--phasic response to normal polarity D. C. pulses,
10 pulses per second, duration as indicated. D--phasic
summation: D.C. (4v, 2 sec.) separated by intervals of 10,
8, 6, 4, and 2 seconds. E-tonic summation: reverse polarity
D.C. (20v, 3 sec.) at points indicated.
