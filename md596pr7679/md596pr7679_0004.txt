by a more linear and elongate curve of relaxation.
The waveforms shown in Fig. 1A are typical of the response
to D. C. stimulation with a duration of a few seconds. Peak
contraction is attained in from 3 to 6.5 seconds, depending
upon the strength of stimulus, while the decay from peak to
half-peak ranges from 4.5 to 11 seconds in different
individual preparations. The latter variation is not
dependent upon stimulus intensity. By contrast, tonic
contractions such as those in Fig. IB average 27 seconds to
peak and 44 seconds to half-decay, neither value showing any
dependence upon stimulus strength. The stimulus mode which
elicits the tonic response is also moderate duration D.C..
the only difference being the reversal of polarity at the
stimulator. In addition, both responsese may be evoked
by various regimes of pulsed stimulation, as long as the
appropriate polarity'is employed for the phasic or tonic
waveform. Fig. 1C illustrates a phasic waveform elicited by
a train of pulses of varying duration.
Both the phasic and the tonic responses are iterative
in that they cannot be induced by single brief stimuli but
require repetitive or continuous activation. It is also
evident that for the phasic waveform both the rate of development
of tension and the degree of tension achieved are dependent
upon the amount of charge passed across the membrane. Thus,
the increasing phasic summation (Fig. 1D) reflects the decrease
