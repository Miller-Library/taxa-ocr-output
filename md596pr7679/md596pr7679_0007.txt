to be attributable to a similar hyperpolarization mechanism.
The individual muscle fibers are known to be several millimeters
in length, and in the process of isolation many fibers have been
cut, leaving a channel for the establishment of intracellular
variation in potential. The reversal of polarity is suggested
to set up an electrochemical gradient which promotes the
diffusion of Ca" inward across the membranes of intact
cells as a result of hyperpolarization. The discrepencies
in time course from those reported by Uchitel and Garcia
are to be expected because of significant ultrastructural
differences between the two muscles, and are equally reflected
in the respective phasic responses.
The similarity of the phasic and tonic waveforms to those
obtained on a faster time scale for crustacean striated
muscle points out the phylogenetic transcendence of the basic
functional principles of muscular response. Further characteriÂ¬
zation, both electrophysiological and pharmacological, of this
preparation will enhance our appreciation of its adaptive
structural properties.
SUMMARY
Electrophysiological data were gathered on an isolated
segment of the somatic musculature of Cryptochiton stelleri,
a subtidal Polyplacophoran.
1. The muscles were found to be iterative, single short
stimuli evoking no response.
2. Both steady D.C. (2 sec.) and trains of short
