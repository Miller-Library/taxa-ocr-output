INTRODUCTION
The musculature of mollusks has attracted the attention
of phsiologists for many years largely because molluscan
smooth muscle exhibits two unusual properties. One is
the unusually great capacity for development of tension
by smooth muscles of bivalves. The other is the occurrence
of "catch", a change in physical state, first described
in the clam Pecten maximus by von Uexkull (1912), and since
extensively investigated in Mytilus edulis (e.g., Twarog, 1967)
Molluscan muscles exhibit a wide variety of ultrastructural
organization varying from classic smooth muscles to
highly complex striated fibers and including smooth muscles
containing paramyosin that posses catch properties. Thus
the phylum cannot be characterized by any one type of
physiological response of somatic muscles.
Even though a comprehensive anatomical characterization
of the musculature of Tonicella is available (Henrici,
1912), there appear to have been no attempts to isolate
preparations of somatic muscles of polyplacophorans for
study of their physiological properties. The procedures
described here were designed to investigate the contractive
properties of one group of somatic muscles of one species of
Polyplacophora, Cryptochiton stelleri (Middendorff 1846).
These preliminary results of isometric responses of the
dorsal oblique muscle show that the responses resemble those
found not only in other mollusks, but in Crustacea as well.
