Isometric Responses of the Somatic Musculature
of Cryotochiton stelleri
(Phylum: Mollusca, Class: Polyplacophora)
Abstract
Electrophysiological data were gathered on an isolated seg-
ment of the somatic musculature of Cryptochiton stelleri, a sub¬
tidal Polyplacophoran.
1. The muscles were found to be iterative, single stimuli
evoking no response.
2. Both steady D.C. (2 sec) and trains of short duration
pulses evoke a short-term "phasic" response, although the time
relationships differ slightly.
3. Steady D.C. of polarity opposite to the above yields a
longer "tonic" response.
4. Both the tonic and phasic contractions will summate, but
only the phasic will sustain a state of tetanus.
5. The tonic response is hypothetically attributed to mem¬
brane hyperpolarization and subsequent Cat influx, and as such.
probably does not occur in vivo.
