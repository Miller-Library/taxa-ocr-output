Harrison
Polyplacophoran Somatic Musculature
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult specimens of Cryptochiton stelleri were collected
subtidally at Mussel Point, California, and amintained in a
large seawater system tank prior to use. From each animal,
an anterior dorsal oblique muscle was isolated and tied off
with silk thread at the dorsal insertion. A ten to fiteen
millimeter segment was then excised and the untied end
secured in a plexiglass muscle clamp having imbedded Ag/AgCl¬
electrode, and the entire system was maintained at about
15°C for the duration of the experiment. The muscle was
secured at its working length as measured in the intact animal
and allowed to equilibrate for about twenty minutes.
Isometric responses were coupled by a Grass FT.O3 Force
Transducer to a Grass Model 5 Polygraph through a Model
5PIC Low Level D.C. Preamplifier.
RESULTS
A respresentative sample of isometric responses from
anterior oblique muscle preparations of Cryptochiton stelleri
to various regimes of electrical stimulation is illlustrated
in Figure 1. The contractions may be generalized into two
basic types of waveform: a rapidly ascending and decaying
"phasic" form, and a slower "tonic" response that is characterized
by a period of latency preceding the development of tension and
