DISCUSSION
Although the characteristics of the phasic waveform from
a dorsal oblique muscle of Cryptochiton stelleri are
generally comparable with those of other molluscan non-striated
muscles such as the opaque adductor of Pecten (Prosser, 1973,
p. 747), both the character and the means of elicitation of the
tonic response are anomalous. Significantly, there is no
evidence of differentiation between fibers or contractile
fibrils that would indicate fast and slow response capabilities.
Consequently, the source of the variation in response must
be sought elsewhere.
Preliminary reports on the development of tension in
crayfish motor fibers as a consequence of membrane hyper¬
polarization (Reuben et al., 1967, p. 634) have recently
been confirmed in other crustaceans (Uchitel & Garcia, 1974,
p. 111). The characteristics of the evoked waveform include
a period of latency and a time to peak and time to half
decay considerably longer than those of normally elicited
responses. Furthermore, the contraction following hperpolar¬
ization has been proven independent of normal intracellular
mechanisms for release and sequestration of Ca' and is a
function of inward diffusion of Ca from the bathing medium
in response to the imposed electrochemical gradient.
On the basis of the waveform similarities, the tonic
response of the chiton smooth muscle is tentatively suggested
