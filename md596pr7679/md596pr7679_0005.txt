in interval between pulses and can be extra-polated to approximate
the type of waveform in Fig. 1C. By contrast, summation in
the tonic mode is accompanied by the latency of response and
retains a characteristic sawtooth appearance (Fig. IE).
In the phasic mode, a tetanic contraction can be achieved
which, for a muscle or working length 9 mm under a rest tension
of 17.5 g, peaks at a maximum tension of 24.6 g.
As in other smooth muscles, a constant tension produces
a gradual elongation which, in the isometric preparation,
is recorded as a steady decrease in resting tension.
Furthermore, a protracted regime of occasional low level
phasic stimulation will cause the rest tension to stabilize.
In preliminary experiments on the dorsal oblique muscle
of Cryptochiton stelleri, reproducible responses could not
be elicited with acetylcholine (10 M), 5-hydroxytryptamine
(10 2 to 10 M), or norepinephrine.
Teased muscle fibers examined by phase contrast microÂ¬
scopy exhibit a diameter of 3.5 to 5 microns and appear
several millimeters long. Under high magnification, contractile
fibrils are visible and of uniform diameter, with no indication
of striation. Thus light microscopy revealed only one type of
fiber. Other details of fine structure are not readily
apparent although the presence of occasional membrane processes
is indicated. The entire muscle is encased in a sheet of
connective tissue.
