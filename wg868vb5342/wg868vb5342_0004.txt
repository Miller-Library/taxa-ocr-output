RESULTS
Results of this study are illustrated in Fig. 2-10.
The data for Site 2 (Fig 2) show that Zone C has a density
of G. becki significantly higher than any other zone. This
zone is characterized by a gravel substrate which is moist to
wet at the surface; it is just above the region of maximum
drift algae, and contains numerous amphipods.
This zone is generally covered once a day during higher high
water (HHW). No significant differences or trends were observed
between two side by side transects when one was surveyed at LLW
and the other surveyed close to LHW (Fig. 3).
Several organisms were found in the drift.
Sites 1, 3,and 4 had much lower densities of G. becki
(Fig. 4, 5, and 6). The zones of highest centipede density for
Sites 3 and 4 are characterized by approximately the same conditions
as those with the most centipedes in Site 2, while the zone for
Site 1 occurs at a higher tidal level, isodryer and farther
above the drift, and contains no amphipods.
Centipedes of the Order Lithobiomorpha were scarce and
found only near land vegetation, except at Site 4.
Most centipedes found were on substrata which were moist but
not wet at the surface (Fig. 7). However, zones B and 66 which
containea major√©ty of the goneipedes, are submerged at HHW.
The majority of centipedes were found in groups. Zones
of highest density contained the largest groups (Fig. 1).
Groups ranged in size from 2 to 16 members, and smaller indi-
viduals had a higher percentage of membership in large groups
(Fig. 8). Size distribution of all measured centipedes is
shown in Fig. 9. Mean size did not vary between zones (Fig. 10).
