For each individual or group of centipedes found, con-
ditions of moisture, substrate, type of environment (under rock
or in drift) and other organisms found with centipedes were re¬
corded. In addition, average values for these parameters were ae¬
estimated for each entire zone, based upon conditions under all
rocks overturned.
The composition of the dominant elements of the substrate
beneath each rock (sand, gravel, and soil) were recorded using
the following categories: (1) Bome present, (2) Present in
approximately equal proprtions with another type, (3) Present
as the dominating type, and (4) Exclusively present.
Moisture under rocks was assessed on the following scale:
(1) Substrate dry, (2) Substrate dry at surface, moist beneath,
(3) Substrate moist from surface downward, (4) Substrate with
water droplets visible and/or wet to touch, (5) Rock and substrate
submerged
Amount of drift algae in each zone was estimated on a scale
from 1 to 5, using the following categories: (1) None present,
(2) Present, but scattered and thin, (3) Isolated patehbssof
drift covering some rocks, (4) Large patches of drift covering
up to 50% of zone, (5) 50-100% of zone is covered with drift
approximately 1 footdeep, erdeeper.
All surveys were conducted in the period May 12- May 26,
1982, at tidal levels in the field ranging from a lower low
water (LLW) level of -1.6 feet to the rising tide of a lower high
water (LHW) of 4.3 feet. No zones were surveyed while submerged.
