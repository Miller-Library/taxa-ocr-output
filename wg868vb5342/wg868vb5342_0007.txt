ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Dr. Donald P. Abbott for his extensive

involvement in this project at all stages, his enthusiasum, and
his very useful criticism. I would also like to thank Mr. Roy
Johnson for use of identified G. becki specimans, without which
the identity of the critter would have remained a mystery, and
I would like to thank Chris Patton for the up close and personal
view of the animal using electron microscopy. And of course, I
must thank Freya Sommer for putting up with me for the entire
quarter.
