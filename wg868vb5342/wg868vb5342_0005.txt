DISCUSSION
The location of the main body of the G. becki population
indicates that the species is part of the littoral or drift
community. Since some G. becki were found wandering in loose
drift, the centipedes may be feeding there. The number of drift
wanderers found may be much lower than the number actually there,
due to the relative difficulty of finding the animals in the
drift as compared to finding them under rocks.
The high density of G. becki at Site 2 suggests that both a
large number of rocks and presence of alot of drift provide
optimum conditions for this species. Only Site 1 had close to
the density of drift at Site 2, and it contained many fewer rocks.
The centipede population is concentrated in a zone which
is submerged once per day. Furthermore, individuals in Zone B
were found while the tide was rising to LHW, and this zone is
submerged at LHW. At the Pt. Pinos site, two specimens were
found together in Zone B ten minutes before the zone was sub-
merged. All this evidence suggests that G. becki do not avoid
submergence in seawater, and may be regularly submerged.
Most centipedes at Site 1, which was most exposed to wave
action, occurred at a higher tidal level than was the case for
the rest of the sites, suggesting some avoidance to strong wave
action or submergence. The Site 1 distribution may also be in¬
fluenced by the low numbers of rocks in all zones.
The high percentage of centipedes found in grospessuggests that
G. becki is a social animal, and the high percentage of small cen¬
tipedes in large groups indicates a possible "young care'
function for the ggroups. However, the occurance of larger and
