more abundant groups in the most populated zones may be due to
crowding. The distribution of centipedes within any zone (at
least in daylight at low water) is always patchy since the animals
hide under stones, and group size may in part reflect the ratio
of population density to the number of suitable rocks present.
The size distribution curve shows a bimodal trend; however,
this is obviously not a statistically significant result.
SUMMARY
Centipede populations in the splash zone of Monterey Bay
were surveyed, and a high density of the Geophilomorph
Geophilus becki was found beneath the rocks in a zone just above
the attached alga Endocladia muricata and below a tidal level of
+5.6 feet. A high percentage of these were found in groups. Few
Lithobiomorpha were found in the splash zone.
