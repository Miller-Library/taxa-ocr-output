Although centipedes are primarily terrestrial organisms,
some members of the Order Geophilomorpha have been observed in
the littoral zone. One species along English shores, Hydro-
schendila submarina, tolerates 14 hours of submersion in sea-
water (Binyon and Lewis, 1963). The European species Scolde
planes maritimus has been observed to feed upon barnacles and
littorine snails (Blower, 1957). Recently, specimens of Geophilus
becki, also in the Order Geophilomorpha, were found between the
alga Endocladia muricata and iceplant borderline, markers of sea
and land vegetation respectively, along the Monterey Bay
shoreline. Positive identification was made by comparing colÂ¬
lected specimens with animals previously collected along the
Monterey Peninsula by Mr. Roy Johnson, and identified by Dr.
R.L. Crabill of the Smithsonian Institution. Unidentified species
in the Order Lithobiomorpha were also found. The purpose of
this study was to determine the distribution of centipedes near
the shore, and to define the habitatt of G. becki.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sites were chosen along the shore between Lover's Point
and Pt. Pinos, Pacific Grove, California (fig. 1). During pre-
liminary surveys, all centipedes found were beneath rocks,
in gravel substrate, so the following criteria were used in
choosing study sites and transects. (1) All sites had many rocks.
(2) All sites had some gravel in the substrate. (3) Transects
were not established in areas containing only large, immovable
rocks.
