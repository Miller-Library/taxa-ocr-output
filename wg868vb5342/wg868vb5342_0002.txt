Site 1 was most exposed, receiving direct, unblocked wave
action at high tide. Site 2 was least exposed, with most wave
action blocked by an outcropping rock cliff.
At each site, transects were established perpendicular to
shore, extending from the land vegetation, across the area re¬
ceiving splash and spray, to the upper midtide region. Tran¬
sects were 1 meter in width, and divided into 2 meter intervals
along the surface of the slope. The erect alga occurring
highest in the intertidal region (usually Endocladia muricata)
was used to mark the boundary between Zones A and B.
Within each defined zone of a transect, all movable rocks
large enough to be firmly pressed against the substrate and house
a centipede were overturned and counted. (Rocks atop other rocks
were found not to conceal centipedes, and were therefore not
counted.) The area beneath each rock was examined for centi¬
pedes; some centipedes were visible upon overturning the rock,
and others were searched for by digging with a trowel to a depth
of 10-15 cm into the substrate under the rock.
Along some transects, centipedes were found but not col¬
lected. Those centipedes were counted in the field, and not handled
unless found in large groups. Large groups were temporarily
sequestered by scooping them up in a jar, and the animals counted
while taking each individual out and replacing it on the sub-
strate where found. Along the remaining transects, all centipedes
found were collected. Individuals and small groups were oounted
at the collecting site, while large groups were collected and
later counted and measured in the laboratory. Escapees were also
counted.
