Fig. 12. Aurelia labiata planula cumulative mortality in 10 ppb atrazine. Total number of deaths
increased daily by a rate of 1.91 new deaths per day. Highest cumulative mortality rate of all
treatments observed in 10 ppb atrazine dilution. Error bars represent standard deviation from the
mean.
Fig. 13. Aurelia labiata planula cumulative mortality in 30 ppb atrazine. Cumulative deaths of
planula since start of experimental run. Average increase of 1.23 new deaths per day. Error bars
represent standard deviation from the mean.
Fig. 14. Turnover time in Aurelia labiata planulae in relation to atrazine concentration. Mean
turnover times for each atrazine concentration plotted to determine any correlation with atrazine.
With increased atrazine concentration (ppb), turnover time lengthens by 0.12 days. Error bars
represent standard deviation from the treatment mean.
