daily mortality plots. Despite this fact, mortality data are still valid given that they follow a clear
trend.
The availability of food may have been the largest source of variation among dishes.
During the 14-day time series, the developing polyps were not fed. However, sand-filtered
seawater was used to prepare the atrazine and control dilutions and this seawater may have
contained various microorganisms, upon which the polyps may have fed. During observation,
several dishes were observed with ciliate infestations and polyps were often observed eating
ciliates. Differences in food availability would have affected growth and development in
established polyps, but would have had negligible effects on observations of planula settlement.
Predation on unmetamorphosed planulae by settled polyps may also have confounded mortality
data.
A variety of potential mechanisms potentially account for the negative effect of atrazine
on A. labiata planula settlement. Atrazine is an herbicide designed to kill plants, thus it may have
reduced (via interference with the photosynthetic electron transport system) the amount of
organic biofilm coating the experimental dishes, making the substrates were less desirable to the
planula larvae, accounting for decreased settlement (DeLorenzo et al. 2001). Various chemicals
have been shown to induce metamorphosis of the planula larva into a polyp, especially in
tropical rhizostome jellies (such as Cassiopeia xamachana and C. andromeda). Planulae of
Cassiopeia seem to favor “dirty" substrates with a bio-organic film present, such as that
produced by bacteria whilst decomposing mangrove leaves, thereby releasing proline-rich
peptides, indicating the presence of mangroves, ideal habitat for Cassiopeia (Müller and Leitz
2002; Fitt and Hoffmann 1985; Fleck et al. 1999; Fleck and Fitt 1999). Induction of settlement
via chemical cues suggests a chemosensory mechanism in planula larvae. Given A. labiata’s
