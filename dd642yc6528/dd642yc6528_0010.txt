Ephyra production via polyp strobilation is a key determinant in scyphozoan populations,
thus increased production and survival of polyps is needed to boost medusa numbers (as is
hypothesized to occur with seasonal jelly blooms). However, recruitment of the pelagic larvae to
Ã  substrate is a necessary prerequisite for subsequent asexual propagation of a species. Like
many marine invertebrates, scyphozoan medusae are r-selected, relying on large numbers of
offspring (with a high mortality rate) to further the species, however, prolonging settlement
likely artificially increases mortality among planulae. Studies on respiration and metabolism on
the lecithotrophic planulae estimate maximal survival period at one week for A. aurita
(Schneider and Weisse 1985); should chemicals (like atrazine) delay settlement for a sufficient
amount of time beyond this maximal survival time, individual larvae may use up their energy
reserves and die. Any factors that influence settlement and thereby increase larval mortality
likely have lasting effects on the population, should they decrease abundance of polyps on a
sufficiently large scale.
There were various factors which may have confounded some aspects of the present
study, most importantly simple human error during observation contributing to inaccurate
counts. Motile planulae were small, but placed in a relatively large dish; active individuals may
have moved around within the dish and thereby been counted multiple times. To rectify this
problem, the lowest count was used in determining planulae numbers in each dish, as this
counting methodology theoretically accounted for double-counting motile planulae. However,
this method confounded the mortality data, given planula numbers may have been
underestimated by taking the lowest number, thus subsequent days may have had a higher
planula count. This created a negative mortality among planulae, seen in the cumulative and
