(P-0.0017). Interestingly, the rate of planula disappearance and the rate of polyp appearance
were higher in the atrazine treatments than the control (table III).
Mortality Analysis
Data on mortality in each treatment was also collected for the entire time series. Mortality
data was rather confounded due to the counting methodology used to analyze planula and polyp
populations within each dish (see discussion), however, some general trends were evident.
Analyzing cumulative mortality (i.e. the total number of dead individuals by day, evidenced by
daily differences from the initial population), all treatments showed an increase in deaths over
time, though the degree of difference varied by treatments (table IV). The control group
increased mortality by 0.29 deaths per day per day (i.e. 0.29 individuals died daily, fig. 10). The
increase in mortality for the 1 ppb, 10 ppb, and 30 ppb atrazine treatments were 1.34, 1.91, and
1.23 new deaths per day per day, respectively (fig. 11, 12, and 13). With an ANOVA, there was
a statistically significant difference in cumulative mortality with atrazine concentration
(P=0.0354).
Discussion
Analysis of the data gathered during the 14-day observation of A. labiata planula
settlement indicates that atrazine indeed impedes the transition from planula to polyp. Atrazine
clearly prolongs settlement time in A. labiata, given the large disparity in turnover time between
atrazine treatments and the control. For each part per billion of atrazine, settlement time
(evidenced by turnover time) seemed to increase by 0.12 days (fig. 14); such finding calls to
attention the danger of large atrazine concentrations (230 ppb) that may prolong settlement
beyond the natural 7-day maximal survival period for Aurelia planulae.
