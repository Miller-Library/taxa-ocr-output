Fig. 1. Aurelia labiata planula settlement: control treatment. Successive life-stages (from planula
to developing polyps) plotted over 14-day time series. Clear, rapid decrease in percent of
planulae in population after 2 days. Error bars omitted for clarity.
Fig. 2. Aurelia labiata planula settlement in 1 ppb atrazine. Successive life-stages plotted over 14
days; decline in planula abundance gradual. Error bars omitted for clarity,
Fig. 3. Aurelia labiata planula settlement in 10 ppb atrazine. Life-stages plotted over full time
series. Planula dominance clearly prolonged, with planula still present until 27 days from start,
Error bars omitted for clarity.
Fig. 4. Aurelia labiata planula settlement in 30 ppb atrazine. Plots of life stages yield obvious
planula dominance (250% population) for nearly 6 days. Error bars omitted for clarity.
Fig. 5. Aurelia labiata turnover point. Trendlines for planulae and total settled polyps intersect to
give time (1.96 days) when dominance shifted from larvae to polyp within all control treatments,
Error bars represent standard deviation from the mean.
Fig. 6. Aurelia labiata turnover point in 1 ppb atrazine. Planulae and settled polyp populations
used to extrapolate trendline; intersection gives turnover time (4.28 days) for population
dominance shift. Error bars represent standard deviation from the mean.
Fig. 7. Aurelia labiata turnover point in 10 ppb atrazine. Trendlines extrapolated from plots of
planulae and sessile polyps over full time series. Intersection used to determine time (4.93 days)
when population shifted from predominantly free-swimming larvae to settled polyps. Error bars
represent standard deviation from the mean.
Fig. 8. Aurelia labiata turnover point in 30 ppb atrazine. Plotted trendline from planulae and
polyp counts gave intersection point, where population dominance shifts. Turnover time (6.27
days) was the highest of all experimental treatments. Error bars represent standard deviation
from the mean.
Fig. 9. Aurelia labiata turnover for all experimental treatments and control. Plot with all
treatments shows clear shift in intersection point of planula and polyp percentages with increased
atrazine concentration. Intersection shifted right (i.e. turnover time longer) with greater atrazine
concentrations. Error bars omitted for clarity.
Fig. 10. Aurelia labiata planula cumulative mortality. Total number of dead individuals after
successive days following start of time series increases over time. Average increase of 0.29
deaths daily. Error bars represent standard deviation from the mean.
Fig. 11. Aurelia labiata planula cumulative mortality in 1 ppb atrazine treatment. Total number
of deaths summed after each day. Average increase of 1.34 deaths per day. Error bars represent
standard deviation from the mean.
