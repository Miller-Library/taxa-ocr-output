14-day time series, settlement was indeed delayed, evidenced by the significant increase in
turnover time in high atrazine dilutions. In these treatments, it took longer for population
dominance to switch from free-swimming planulae to settled sessile polyps.
Materials and Methods
Atrazine Preparation
10 mg of solid powdered atrazine (98% purity, MW=215.6 gmol“) was diluted in 1 mL
(DMSO) organic solvent. The 1 mL of atrazine/DMSO solution was diluted into 1 L of unfiltered
seawater to make a stock solution at 4.6x10° M (1000 ppb). This stock solution was further
diluted for the individual treatments; treatments prepared included 1 ppb atrazine (4.6x10° M).
10 ppb atrazine (4.6x103 M), and 30 ppb atrazine (1.39x10" M).
For planula settlement studies, 1 L of each atrazine concentration (1, 10, 30 ppb) was
prepared. For the 1-ppb atrazine dilution, 100 ul of the stock solution was added to 1 L unfiltered
seawater. For the 10-ppb atrazine solution, 1000 ul of stock solution was diluted in 1 L unfiltered
seawater. The highest (30 ppb) atrazine dilution was prepared with 3000 ul of stock solution in 1
L'seawater.
Planula Settlement
New live-quality glass bowls (4-inch diameter) were prepared by rinsing and scrubbing in
freshwater (without any detergent or other cleaning chemicals) to remove any chemical residues
that might have confounded experimental results. The dishes were soaked in unfiltered seawater
for 12 hours to culture the organic biofilm preferred for planula settlement. Each dish was filled
with 150 mL of seawater with the appropriate dilution of the herbicide atrazine as prepared
above.
Planulae for study were pipetted off the manubrium of an adult female Aurelia labiata
brooding larvae (specimen held at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey, California).
