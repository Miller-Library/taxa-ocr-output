significant in areas of the Great Barrier Reef, but exactly how much chemical pollution from
agricultural pesticides and herbicides is being released remains unknown. Analysis of
agricultural chemicals’ effects on coral reproduction (specifically planula settlement) is indeed
urgent given the potential for large impacts over a broad scale.
Basic studies of atrazine on other marine invertebrate embryos and larvae during
development is key to understanding the full scale of this chemical’s potential environmental
impact. This study was initiated well after the establishment of atrazine as a common
commercial herbicide; despite the fact that it has been widely used for a considerable amount of
time, only recently have the negative effects of this chemical been elucidated. Such findings
suggest a major revision in chemical testing criteria prior to release for large-scale application is
necessary. The ecological implications of atrazine in marine communities may be widespread
and merit a critical overhaul of current pesticide usage in agriculture to better account for
inevitable leakage of these toxic chemicals into the ocean.
Conclusions
In high atrazine concentrations, there was a clear increase in the time planulae dominated
the experimental population, consistent with a treatment effect of the herbicide, suggesting it
prolongs settlement time. Atrazine also induced higher mortality over the full time series,
potentially due to delaying of settlement beyond maximal survival period of the larva. Together,
these data present strong evidence for the negative effects of atrazine, the most commonly used
herbicide in the United States and as such, there is sufficient need for a critical re-analysis of
herbicide usage and potential ecological effects of agricultural runoff.
