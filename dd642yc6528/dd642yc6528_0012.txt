preferred settlement on substrates with a biofilm, perhaps atrazine somehow interfered with the
chemosensory mechanism(s) of the planula, accounting for decreased settlement in higher
atrazine concentrations.
Atrazine has been shown to induce aneuploidy in oysters (Bouilly et al. 2003); such
chromosome mutations significantly affect growth and development. Any occurrence of
aneuploidy in planulae may potentially account for decreased settlement with higher atrazine
concentrations. Given the necessity of intact, functional chromosomes in developmental
processes, alteration via chemical pollutants may significantly delay settlement if genes involved
in settlement are somehow tainted. Similarly, any interruptions of other chemical or protein
systems within the planula may also explain the negative effects of atrazine. In salmon, atrazine
has been shown to induce elevated levels of thyroxine, a chemical Spangenberg (1984b) reported
to decrease statolith formation in Aurelia polyps and ephyrae (Waring and Moore 2004). If
similar processes are occurring in planula and affecting their ability to determine orientation
during settlement, this may explain decreased settlement at high levels of the herbicide.
Such a finding of negative impacts on key phases in scyphozoan development merits
further investigation due to its significance on a broader scale. Scyphozoans are typically tolerant
of poor ocean conditions, able to thrive in conditions few other animals would be able to survive.
The scyphozoan Aurelia aurita is a generalist, able to persist in a variety of habitats (including
polluted waters) by relying on its benthic polyp stage for persistence in such diverse
environmental conditions; the polyps of A. aurita are quite hardy, able to survive for long
periods of time without food and exhibit little specificity of diet (Lucas 2001). Recent research
has suggested polyps of the medusa Chrysaora quinquecirrha are able to tolerate hypoxic
