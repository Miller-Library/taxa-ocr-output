Abstract
Anthropogenic pollution has widespread impacts on development of marine organisms as myriad
chemicals make their way into coastal ecosystems. The present study examined effects of the
commonly used herbicide atrazine. Potential effects of atrazine were observed using
scyphozoans, model organisms useful as indicators of unbalanced ecosystems, specifically
testing effects on cultured planula larvae of the medusa Aurelia labiata. Planula settlement was
observed over 14 days in seawater with 3 dilutions of atrazine (1 ppb, 10 ppb, and 30 ppb)
Turnover time, when population dominance shifted from free-swimming larvae to sessile polyps,
was longest in the highest atrazine dilution relative to the control treatment (6.27 days versus
1.96 days, respectively), indicating a significant treatment effect of atrazine (P-0.0015),
Similarly, cumulative mortality was higher with increased atrazine concentration. These data
suggest atrazine negatively affects development of cnidarians. Scyphozoans are typically more
tolerant of poor ocean conditions, therefore these results raise concern for effects on other marine
organisms more sensitive to environmental conditions.
