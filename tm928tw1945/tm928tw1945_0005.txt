Discussion
The results shoun in Figures 3, 4 and 5 indicate that algal-microfauna
associations at Pt. 42 are characterized by having more species of animals
and higher diversity indices values than those at Pt. Pinos. If ue accept the
idea of Pt. 12 being a control, a natural environment that is not polluted as
there is reason to believe Pt. Pinos is, then this data suggests that the entirety
of Pt. Pinos is somehou changed. Differences in diversity indices and numbers
of species found in the samples taken around the point shou areas of changed
community structure, uhich correlated with the distribution of seuage effluent
imply that parts of Ft. Pinos are polluted. Accepting the hypothesis that louer
values for species diversity indices and numbers of species uhen correlated
with seuage effluents indicate pollution damage, Figures 3, 4 and 5 imply
that all of Pt. Pinos has suffered pollution damage.
Houever, to test the validity of the data statistical methods were em-
ployed. Significant differences (pe.001) uere found betueen the "polluted'
and "unpolluted" areas at Pt. Pinos and betueen "polluted" areas at Pt. Pinos
and areas at Pt. 12.for the numbers of species of animals found associated with
the algae. There was not a significant difference betueen the "unpolluted"
group and Ft. 42 for this criterion, suggesting that numbers of species of
animals found in a group of samples can reveal changes in a community.
For the diversity indices significant differences (pe.001) were found
betueen all comparisons. This uould suggest that diversity indices vary too
much from sample to sample to serve as effective indicators. Houever, by
comparing the "unpolluted" group with itself and the Et. 42 group uith itself
insignificant differences (p2.2) were found for both diversity indices. This
indicates that the igdices are consistent within a given geographical area
such as Pt. Pinos and that they do serve as indicators of change in a community.
