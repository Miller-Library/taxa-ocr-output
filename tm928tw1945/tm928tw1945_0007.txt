seuage outfall and a current system that would distribute the effluent in
pattern corresponding to the damaged areas, the immediate outfall area was
Labelled polluted. Later, in thesummer, another point was sampled and compared
with Pt. Pinos. Also, Pt. Finos was resampled to determine the effects of
seasonal variation on the communities. Results indicated that natural variation
was less than variations observed at Pt. Pinos, andtthat Pt. Pinos algal-
microfaunalassociations uere significantly different than those at a contro
point. Seasonal variation over a tuo month period was found to have little
effect on the Pt. Pinos microfaumal commumities.
