Introduction
Uhile noticeable differences in numbers of species and diversity
indices uere found to exist in the microfaumal communities associated with
the three species of algae examined around the polluted portion of Pt. Finos
(Clearman, 1970), the role of the effluent in causing these differences may
not be clearly stated until more is knoun of the natural variation in com-
munities of this type. It is possible that the observed differences fall
within the general range of natural variation along the point. In order to
provide an ansuer to this question, a study similar to the survey at Pt.
inos (Clearman, 1970) uas undertaken at another area chosen to represent
an unpolluted, natural environment. This area is an unnamed point, hereafter
referred to as Point 42, that lies approximately 1000 meters south of Pt.
Pinos. The point is approximately 2/3 the length of Pt. Pinos, but is of a
similar conformation, and maintains the general Nu orientation of Pt. Pinos.
Uave action at the tuo points is roughly comparable, although Pt. Pinos
may recieve slightly heavier wave action at times.
By studying algal-microfauna associations on this point, it uas hoped t
see hou natural communities compared with those previously observed at Pt.
Pinos, thus allowing a firmer statement to be madelofthe effluents effect
on the communities studied.
Also, key areas, as revealed by the original survey at Pt. Pinos, uere
resampled to determine the composition of the communities after a tuo month
interval to see hou they compared to the results of the first study carried out
during the spring.
