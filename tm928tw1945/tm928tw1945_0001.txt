Abstract
The abundance and distribution of microfauna found associated with
Prionitis lanceolata at a point chosen to represent an unpolluted, natural
environment. The results of this study were compared to the results of a
previous study made in the Pt. Pinos area. Also, areas at Pt. Pinos uere
resampled to determine the effects of seasonal variation on microfaunal
communities. Results indicate that differences in microfaunal community
structure observed at Pt. Pinos are greater than those attributable to
the effects of natural variation. Seasonal varistion uas found to have
little effect in the Pt. Pinos area. From these results a hypothesis for
testing for pollution damage in an area uas formulated.
