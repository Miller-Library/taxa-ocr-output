Prionitis lanceolata was the alga selected for study because it's
associated microfauna shoued the most marked effects near the outfall.
Ten stations (areas) were sampled around Pt. 42 with three replicates made
at each area (Fig. 1). The samples were analyzed in themanner previously
described (Clearman, 1970). Again, the Simpson andshannon-leiner indices
uere used to compute values for species diversity.
At Pt. Pinos four key areas in the vicinity of the outfall (areas 4, 5,
and 7) and areas at the end of the point (area 10) and directly across
from the outfall (area 12) were resampled (Fig. 3, Clearman, 1970). Sample
analysis was carried out as befors (Clearman, 1970).
The results of the original study, the summer resamples and the samples
at Pt. 12 uere compared in terms of numbers of species present and the diversit
indices.
In order to statistically compare areas felt to be polluted with natural,
unpolluted areas, the data was divided into three groups. Pt. Pinos was divided
into tuo groups designated "polluted", composed of arsas felt to be heavily
damaged, as shoun by lou values for the diversity indices and the small number
of species found, and Funpolluted", consisting of the remaining areas around
the point. These tuo groups and Pt. 42 (all areas) were compared by employing
the Student's t test, using the mean values and standard deviations of the
species diversity indices and the number of species of the three groups.
Finally, the "unpolluted" group at Pt. Pinos and the areas of Pt. 42 uere
randomly divided into equal groups and compared by the Student's t test, as
above, to test the internal variability of the three criteria tested.
