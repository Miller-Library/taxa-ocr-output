Et. 42 The tabulated data for the samples at this point are shoun in
Table 1. Table 2 shous the species composition for these samples. A scattered
distribution, as expected in a natural environment, is seen. Figure 2 shous
a distribution of the animals by phyla. Figure 3 is a plot of the mean number
of species against sample areas. Also on thegraph are the results of the
first study and summer resampling at Pt. Pinos for comparison. (Note: The
identification of annelids at Pt. 42 and in the resample are more complete than
those at Pt. Pinos. This accounts for an increase of 2-3 species. Houever
the incresse in number of species is also due to finding types not previously
found at Pt. Pinos.
igure h is a plot of mean values of thesimpson index against sample areas,
uhile Figure 5 does the same for the Shannon-einer diversity index. As before,
Pt. Finos results are incorporated for comparison. Note that in all cases the
values at Pt. 42 are higher than those at Pt. Pinos, and that the variations
in these values at Pt. 42 are not as extreme as those at Pt. Pinos.
t. Pinos Table 3 shous the tabulated data for these samples, uhile
able 4 shous the species composition. Note the similarity to the results
of the original survey. Figure 6 shous the distribution by phyla, and Figures
3, 4 and 5 contain the mean values by areas for numbers of species, Simpson
and Shannon-Meiner indices as mentioned above. The results of the summer reÂ¬
samples correspond to those observed earlier at Pt. Pinos, especially in the
area of the outfall. Areas 10 and 12 have louer values for the divesity
indices and number of species than corresponding samples from the Spring.
This differences seemsto be due to seasonal variation at Pt. Pinos.
Table 5 presents the mean values and standard deviations derived from
the tabulated data andused in comparing the three sets of samples. It alst
gives the results of the comparisons betusen the groups using the Student's
t test.
