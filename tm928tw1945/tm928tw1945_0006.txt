The data thus implies that all oft. Finos is significantly different from
the "control" area and that all of Pt. Pinos may be subtly altered by seuage
pollution, aside from the heavily damaged area in the immediate vicinity of the
outfall. It may be that extreme differences in the numbers of species found, as
at Pt. Pinos, indicate severe changes in a community, uhile the slight dif-
ferences observed at Pt. 42 are the result of natural variation. Diversity
indices on the other hand may reflect more subtle changes that differences in
the numbers of species do not shou.
Besides helping to confirm some of the interpretations of the results of
the first study at Pt. Pinos, namely that certain areas of the point are severely
damaged by seuage pollution, these results allou for the formation of a
hypothesis for testing for pollution damage in an area.
If, by comparing algal microfauna in a presumed polluted area and a
similar unpolluted or less polluted area, an investigator can demonstrate
statistically significant (pe.Ol) differences in the number of species found
or in diversity indices that characterize the community, then he may label
his presumed area as being polluted. Houever, there are several limitations
to such an hypothesis.
The investigator should have some reason for presuming an arsa to be
polluted- visible differences betueen the tuo areas, a polluting element in the
environment or a mechanism to account for the pollution. Also, natural
variations baced on environmental and seasonal differences must not be discounted
As a case in point, consider the approach to the Pt. Finos area. Visible dif.
ferences in the macrofauna and flora in areas near and auay from thebutfall
prompted the investigation of the microfaunal communities. Significant dif
ferences in the numbers of species found and in diversity indices betueen areas
near the outfall and those suay from it uere found. Based on the presence of a
