Introduction
The area of transition just above and including the high intertidal zone
is characterized by a unique blend of marine and terrestial conditions. It
is an area inhabited by few obvious species. One of the dominant forms is the
isopod Ligia occidentalis, which inhabits rocky rubble immediately above the
highest tide mark (Miller, 1938).
Nothing is known of the role Ligia occidentalis plays in the conversion
of biomass in this habitat, of its food habits or its food preferences.
Studies of Ligia pallasii (Carefoot, 1973) indicate it is an effective
consumer of macro algae in the high intertidal and may effect a measurable
control on the abundance of certain algae in that zone.
This study is a documentation of the dietary habits of Ligia occidentalis
both in the field and laboratory. It also reports on preliminary experiments
indicating an activity pattern differing from that reported for other Ligia
species.
Methods
Ligia occidentalis was collected along the rocky shore in Pacific Grove,
California, at Lovers Point and at Hopkins Marine Station from the large rocky
rubble located 1.00-1.25 m above the endocladia zone. This region receives
salt-water spray during high tide which collects on pools under this rubble
and ensures a supply of water that Ligia may dip their uropods into. In these
high tidepools grow various blue-green, and filamentous green algae. The
stock supply of isopods was kept in plastic tubs perforated on the bottom with
small holes. Each tub was supplied with running sea water at 15 degrees
centigrade. Algae were supplied for food. All experiments were carried out
at an air temperature of 18-21 degrees centigrade.
