I would like to thank Professor Gilly for professional quidance and
uplifting my spirits when the going got tough. Special thanks to Dr. Abbott
for the great lessons in Ligia anatomy, and to Dr. Issabella Abbott for the
lessons on algae identification and for getting me to say "algae" instead of
"algaes."
