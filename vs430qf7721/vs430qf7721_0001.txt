Abstract
Analyses of fecal pellet contents of freshly collected Ligia occidentalis
showed the principle foods were a variety of brown, red and green algae wrack
Ligia occidentalis prefers to eat the brown algae Macrocystis pyrifora and
Gstoseira, when given a choice of several seaweeds. A correlation was
established between the fecal pellet contents and algae available in the study
sites.
