Field Studies
The following experiment determined what species of algae Ligia consumed
in the field. Twenty Ligia were collected from the Hopkins and Lovers Point
sites and placed in separate plastic tubs for 24hrs. Fecal pellets from each
group were collected, mounted on slides, and compared to reference slides of
algae. The presence or absence of algae in each pellet was recorded. The
frequency of occurrence of algae which appeared in fecal pellets from both
sites was then compared.
Examination of fecal pellets collected from the field specimens held for
24hrs, revealed the following (see Fig. 1). Ligia from the Hopkins site
consumed significantly more blue-green and green algae than the Ligia from
Lovers Point. Macrocystis and Cystoseira were taken more frequently at the
Lovers Point site. Porphyra and diatoms were the other food items commonly
found in the fecal pellets of Ligia. Granite fragments were present in 55
percent (Hopkins) to 85 percent (Lovers Point) of the fecal pellets,
indicating that the Ligia may be actively consuming granite as part of their
diet. Red alga were eaten with a greater frequency at Lovers Point, but were
still found less than 10 percent of the time.
Estimate of the Relative Abundance of Drift Macro Algae
Estimates of the relative abundance of drift algae in each study site
were made in the following manner. Five 10m transects were placed parallel to
the shore contours. Ten .25 x .25m quadrats placed at regular intervals along
each transect were then used to sample the area for drift algae. Algae were
identified by eye and their presence noted on data sheets. Relative abundance
was obtained by dividing the number of times an alga was found in the quadrat
by the total number of quadrats taken.
