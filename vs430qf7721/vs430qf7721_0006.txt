Their activity during the day is a pattern opposite to that reported for
Ligia pallasii (Carefoot, 1973) and for other species of Ligia (Saito, 1965).
These two Ligia were most active at night. The physiological adaptations of
diurnal chromatophore changes (Armitage, 1960) and sensitive visual system
(Ruck & Jahn, 1954) give Ligia an adaptive advantage for daylight foraging.
Behaviorally, Ligia exhibit a quick startle response, which sends them
scurrying for the nearest available cover (Armitage, 1960). Because Ligia can
forage underneath the rocky rubble, they may not be vary susceptable to
predation by birds.
One can speculate that the Ligia may help the dispersal of various types
of alga, such as the high intertidal Porphyra. The presence of a healthy baby
plant within the fecal pellet (personal observation) and the lack of
cellulase in the gut (Nicholls, 1931) may indicate a mechanism whereby Ligia
are dispersing rather than limiting the distribution of some high-intertidal
algae.
Whether or not the granite fragments are utilized to grind and break
through the tough cell wall of the algae or are taken accidentally while the
Ligia are eating diatoms is a question which remains to be answered.
Although the Ligia are eating these various food types, we still do not
know what they are utilizing. The gut contents look very much like the fecal
pellets and it does not appear that much breakdown of products has occurred.
Perhaps the major ecological role of Ligia occidentalis is to reduce large
drift down into small bits. There is no doubt that they can process large
amounts in very short periods of time (Carefoot, 1973). From the present
results it can be speculated that the role of Ligia in the transition zone is
geared towards disposal of drift algae and that their impact upon the
distribution of intertidal algae may be minimal.
