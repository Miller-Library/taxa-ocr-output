Examination of Fig. 2 reveals two obvious trends. Lovers Point had a
significantly higher amount of the brown algae Macrocystis and Cystoseira, and
Hopkins showed the larger abundance of blue-greens and filamentous greens.
Phyllospadix and the epiphyte Smithora occurred with similar frequency in both
sites.
Food Preference
Food preference in Ligia was tested in the following manner. Twenty
Ligia were starved for 24hrs and placed in a plastic tub containing a
chunk of granite, and equal amounts of algae commonly found in the study
areas. The animals were fed for 48 hrs and all of the fecal pellets
collected. Each pellet was scored using the same method described earlier.
Results from examination of the fecal pellets collected in the food
preference study are shown in Fig. 3. The frequency of occurence was used as
an indicator of "food preference". Significantly more Macrocystis and
Cystoseira were consumed in all of the experimental trials. The red alga
Porphyra was eaten 25-30 percent of the time. Diatoms and granite fragments
were also present.
Activity Pattern
To monitor activity patterns, 10 Ligia were placed in a plastic tub with
various algae for food. A control group of 10 were placed in a separate tub
without food. Each received a constant flow of sea-water. The behavior was
then monitored in 15 minute intervals over a period of 6 hrs. Those Ligia
walking or eating were scored as active. Those Ligia sitting on the rock,
sitting on the algae or resting on the bottom of the tub were considered to be
inactive. For each 15 minute interval the percent active were calculated, and
the results are shown in figure 4.
