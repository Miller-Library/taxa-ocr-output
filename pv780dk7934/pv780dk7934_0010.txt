Interspecific aggression

SUNARY
The sea anemones Anthopleura elegantissma, Metridium
senile, and Corynactis californica are observed to engage
in interspecific aggression. This aggressive behavior is
elicited only thru tentacle contact. The receptors that
detect interspecific antagonists are located only on the
tentacle tips in Anthopleura and Metridium, while Corynactis
detects from the sides of its tentacles.
Metridium and Corynactis were found to occupy different
microhabitats at the field site. I did not observe inter-
specific aggression between them in the field.
I did observe interspecific aggression in the field
between Anthopleura and Metridium, and Anthopleura and
Corynactis.
Interspecific separation lines can be set up by interÂ¬
specific aggression, in the lab.
Each species of anemone exhibits an aggressive behavioral
pattern peculiar to its own species. Anthopleura elegantissma
has morphological structures called acroraghi used specifically
for aggression. Corynactis californica extrudes mesenterial
filaments in a manner similar to its extracoelenteric feed-
ing response when attacked. Metridium senile may produce
mucus during aggression as a self-protective mechanism.
Interspecific aggression and environmental factors such
as light intensity influence the distribution of sea
anemones on the pilings under the Monterey wharf.
