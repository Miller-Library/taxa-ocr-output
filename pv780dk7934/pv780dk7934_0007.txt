Light intensity and anemone distribution
Hand (1955) noted that the Corynactis colonies under the
Monterey wharf occurred on pilings where there was no direct
sunlight. I have found colonies in my study site exposed
to direct sunlight, but these colonies have an upper limit
approximately 3 feet lower than the Corynactis found under
H
the wharf in the shadows. (Figure 1) Light meter readings
taken May 28 ", 4:30 pm, show a four-fold decrease in
foot-candles from the outermost to the innermost pilings,
the latter being in constant shadows. Thus, there is a
positive correlation between decreasing light intensity
and higher Corynactis distribution. The same type of
correlation, but to a lesser degree, holds for Metridium.
On the other hand, regardless of piling position, the A.
elegantissma colonies in my study site always were spread
down to the upper limit of the Corynactis or Metridium
colony below it. It would seem then that light intensity
is not a major factor limiting Anthopleura distribution
on the pilings.
I have observed that within my study site, Metridium
and Corynactis occupy different microhabitats, i.e. they
do not occupy the same piling. I have observed two pilings
that have both Metridium and Corynactis settled on it, but
the interspecfic separation lines are over two feet wide.
