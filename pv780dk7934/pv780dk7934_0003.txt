observed aggression between colormorphs of these two species.
Furthermore, in the field, no intraspecific separation lines
were noted in either M. senile or C. californica.
Interspecific Aggression
To ascertain the dominance hierarchy order, the follow-
ing procedure was utilized (same procedure used in intraspecific
aggression).
Procedure: 1) An anemone was settled in a finger bowl and
its position marked on the outside of the bowl.
2) An interspecific antagonist, settled on a movable substratum
would be brought within contact distance.
3) After a day the outcome of the aggressive event could usually
be determined. Movement away from the confrontation and/or
visible necrosis were the factors used in assessing the outcome.
M. senile was the most sucessful interspecific aggressor,
followed by C. californica. A. elegantissma turned out to be
the least dominant aggressor. These findings and their statÂ¬
istical significance are listed in Table 1. e tadte i he
Aggression and the maintenance of interspecific separation lines
To determine whether aggression was a major factor main-
taining separation lines, the following experiments were performed.
Procedure: 1) Three dissecting pans (8x111.5 inches) were layered
with a white wax bottom.
2) Each pan was filled with a different binary combination
of the three species. The animals were pinned to the wax so
that the initial aggregation patterns were fixed.
