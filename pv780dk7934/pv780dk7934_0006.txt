Interspecific Aggression

Receptor location
To find the location of the receptors that detect in¬
terspecific antagonists, the following experiments were
performed.
Procedure: 1) Tentacles were snipped off all three species
of anemones and used as probes to touch different parts of
an interspecific antagonist.
2) As a control, a clonemates tentacle was used to see if
the anemone would discriminate between self and non-self.
3) A positive response was assumed if the subject retracted
its tentacles and/or signs of aggressive response followed.
Childress (1969) found that an excised A. elegantissma
tentacle was still completely effective in eliciting aggress¬
ion after many (greater than 10) contacts. This observation
was found to be true also with M. senile and C. californica
tentacles.
Metridium and Corynactis did not respond to stimulus by
their own species, while Anthopleura would respond to a non-
clonemate. All three species of anemones also did not respond
to an interspecific tentacle if touched anywhere other than
the tentacles. If touched elsewhere and at the tentacles,
retraction occured. Furthermore, Anthopleura and Metridium
responded only if contact was at the tentacle tip. On the
other hand Corynactis responded only if contact was along the
tentacle sides. I would assume that the receptors that detect
