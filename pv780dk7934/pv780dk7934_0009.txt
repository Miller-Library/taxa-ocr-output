Interspecific Aggression
factors such as dessication, food supply and wave action
undoubtably have some influence on anemone distribution.
The reasons for the aggressive superiority of Metridium
are not immediately obvious. However, my preliminary
observations point out the possibility that the mucus
secreted by Metridium could protect it against Anthopleura.
This protection could be in the form of an anesthetic
inhibiting the firing of nematocysts. Another possibility
is that the mucus serves as a protective coating against
Anthopleura or Corynactis.
Corynactis
feeding" response
Lang (1971 and 1972) noted interspecific aggression in
Scleractinian coral, which are of the order Madreporaria.
She observed that when Scolymia lacera was brought into
contact with Scolymia cubensis, the former would extrude
its mesenterial filaments and digest the tissue of the
latter. Lang (1971) describes this act of aggression as
basically an extracoelenteric feeding response.
This behavior is remarkably similar to the interspecific
aggressive pattern of C. californica, a member of the Order
Corallimorpharia. In Hyman (1940) the Madrepores are reported
as readily derivable from Corallimorphidae. If so, this
would indicate that the receptors that detect interspecific
aggressors are linked to the normal extracoelenteric feeding
behavioral pattern in C. californica.
