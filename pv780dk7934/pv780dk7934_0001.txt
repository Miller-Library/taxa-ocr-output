INTRODUCTION
The sea anemones Anthopleura elegantissma (Brandt,1835),
Metridium senile (Verrill, 1865), and Corynactis californica
(Carlgren, 1936) associate sympatrically on the pilings under
the Monterey wharf.
Anthopleura elegantissma is a west coast anemone. In-
tertidally, it is found from about -2.0 to +4.5 feet above
mean lower low water level. (This is the clonal variety)
Metridium senile is a circumpolar, temperate to cold
water anemone found on both coasts. It can be found as high
as +3.0 feet above mean lower low water level. It also
occurs well below tide marks.
Corynactis californica is found along the Pacific coast
north of the equator. It is most profuse at the mean lower
low water level and below.
On the pilings I have observed interspecific separation
lines approximately 1.5 inches wide between A. elegantissma
and M. senile. Interspecific separation lines about 1 inch
wide have also been found between A. elegantissma and C.
californica.
Childress (1969) has demonstrated that the inter-clonal
