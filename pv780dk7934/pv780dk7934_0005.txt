Interspecific Aggression
Page 5
C. californica. Defensive response would be the more correct
terminology. I have never observed C. californica initiate
interspecific aggression. When attacked, it will retract its
tentacles, shorten its column and contract the sphinctor at
the top of the column. Close examination will disclose a
minor extrusion of some mesenterial filaments thru the mouth.
If not attacked again, C. california will regain its normal
posture in a matter of hours. However, if attacked again,
it will fully extrude its mesenterial filaments onto the
aggressor. This behavior will usually cause the interspecific
antagonist to retract and/or retreat.
I have not seen the capitate tentacles actively used in
aggression by C. california.
Aggressive behavioral pattern of M. senile
Upon tentacular contact with an interspecific antagonist
M. senile partially retracts its tentacles in the local region
of stimulation. It then elongates its body column and bends
toward the victim. During this period, all the tentacles that
face the victim are extended and then applied to it. M. senile
does not withdraw after tentacle application. Usually it is
the victim that breaks contact and initiates avoidance behaviors
such as leaning away, retracting the column, or physically
moving away.
Approximately 70% of the time, M. senile will initiate
aggressive behavior before its interspecific antagonist.
