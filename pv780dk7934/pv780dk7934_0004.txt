Interspecific Aggression

3) The two different species were separated by a zig-zag
pattern boundary made up of microscope slides glued together.
The pattern maximized border anemone contact.
4)
After three days the pins and boundary were removed.
5) Dead or unattached anemones were removed to simulate
field conditions. The experiment was run for two weeks.
Net movement at the borders confirmed the results of
the individual interspecific aggressive confrontations.
M. senile pushed back the A. elegantissma border and killed
the C. californica border anemones. A. elegantissma retreated
from the Corynactis border. A stable border with no contact
between neighboring species was established by the two weeks.
Aggressive behavioral pattern of A. elegantissma
The interspecific aggressive pattern exhibited by A. el
egantissma is identical to its intraspecific behavioral
pattern described by Childress (1969). This behavior can be
separated into six stages: 1) Stimulation, which involves
repeated tentacle contact and withdrawal; 2) Inflation, when
the acrorhagi become turgid; 3) and 4) the Movement of Inflation
and Movement of Application, during which the acrorhagi move
towards the victim; 5) Application of Ectoderm, during which
acrorhagi are applied; and 6) Recovery, when the anemone
returns to its normal posture.
Aggressive behavioral pattern of C. californica
The term "aggressive" is misleading when used to describe
