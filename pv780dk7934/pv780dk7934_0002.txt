Interspecific Aggression

separation lines (Francis, 1973a) found between A. elegantissma
clones are formed and maintained by intra-specific aggression.
Presented is a report on the interspecific aggressive behavior
of the three above mentioned sympatric sea anemones and its
relation to the observed interspecific separation lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collecting and field studies were carried out on the
first eight rows of pilings after the Marina boundary, at Pier
2, Monterey wharf. Field observations and studies were con¬
ducted using SCUBA gear. In the case of A. elegantissma and
M. senile a spatula was utilized to collect specimens (Francis, 1973a)
I used a hammer and chisel to chip offthe Balunus nubilus shells
and their attached Corynactis. This minimized damage and
provided experimental animals on a movable substrate.
The species of anemones were kept separately in tanks that
were supplied with flowing sea water at about 13°C. The
anemones were fed Tigropus califoricnus intermittently except
during experiments when food was withheld.
PROCEDURES, OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS
Intra-specific Aggression
Francis (1973b) has shown intra-specific aggression between
different clones (Francis, 1973a) of A. elegantissma. This does
not seem to be the case with regard to M. senile and C. californica
In the lab, utilizing the procedure outlined below, I never
