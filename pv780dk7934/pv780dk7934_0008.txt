Interspecific aggression
Preliminary Observations
have observed that M. senile will secrete abnormal
amounts of mucus when disturbed, such as in aggression.
Tigropus califoricnus coated with Metridium mucus survive
the entire test period (10 seconds) when placed on the
tentacles of an A. elegantissma. In contrast, uncoated
Tigropus are instantly killed when placed in the same
situation.
Both the coat√©d and uncoated Tigropus are instantly
killed when placed on the tentacles of a C. californica.
DISCUSSTON
As I have noted before (Intro.) the range of A. elegant-
issma can extend down to -2 feet below mean lower low water.
Furthermore, I have found solitary A. elegantissma living
at -52 feet. Yet on the wharf pilings, both varieties
are restricted to a narrow range delineated at the low-
er limit by interspecific borders shared with either
Metridium or Corynactis. This fact, coupled with the border
experiments and dominance hierarchy experiments, indicate
that the distribution of A. elegantissma has been limited
by interspecific aggression with Metridium and Corynactis.
In turn, there is evidence that environmental factors
such as light prevent Metridium and Corynactis from extending
their upper limit of distribution. Other environmental
