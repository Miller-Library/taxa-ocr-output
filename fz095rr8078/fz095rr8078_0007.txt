The most heavily foliated limpets were found living
on vertical landward faces of wave-exposed rocks.
Enteromorpha sp., fronds achieved their greatest length
at sites which were most exposed to waves.
Enteromorpha sp., will continue to grow in culture after
the limpet has been removed. In addition, E. sp., grew
in culture on several smooth substrates and free-floating
in the culture medium. In the field, E. sp., did not survive
on limpet shells from which the soft body parts had been
removed.
DISCUSSION
Enteromorpha sp. appears to require a highly special-
ized micro-habitat. Doty and Newhouse (1954) assert that
the three major boundries to marine algae life are
suitable substrate, temperature and salinity. Additionally,
Harlin (1978) notes Enteromorpha intestinalis, in partic-
ular, requires a diet with high levels of fixed nitrogen.
Meeting the need for large amounts of fixed nitrogen could
be done by growing near sewage outfall areas which is well
documented for E. intestinalis (Boalch, 1957) or by growing
in areas which receive a large amount of wash from waves,
This only partially explains the mid-tidal habitat of
E. sp. 2.
The species of molluscs that Enteromorpha sp., occurred
on were found on the landward side of wave-swept rocks.
This seems consistant with the observation that many, if
not most, organisms occurring in the intertidal must protect
