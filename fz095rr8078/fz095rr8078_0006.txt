it was noted that individual plants which settled and
grew on granite, Mytilus shell, wood and plastic were
easily pulled free, whereas those attaching to limpet shell
were more strongly attached.
It was frequently observed that when two or more
foliated limpets, regardless of species, were placed in a
container 12'x16"x6" or smaller, some limpets would crawl
upon the backs of other limpets. Analysis of gut contents
of the climbing limpets confirmed the presence of E. sp..
as a food consumed by limpets.
In field tests, 20 limpets were removed from their
intertidal rocks, the soft body parts removed, and the
shells with attached algae permanently affixed to the same
mid-tidal granite rock from which they had been taken.
All that remained after three days were algal patches of
cells and a few bleached E. sp., bushes.
In tests to determine the necessity of a live limpet
for algal growth, 30 limpet shells with E. sp.» and
Percursaria growth were maintained in culture as previous-
ly and in a sea water table with a continuous unfiltered flow,
they not only survived, but grew larger. The sole excep¬
tion was a series of cultures in which the algae began to
die after the presence of a fungus was noted.
SUMMARY
Several different green algae were found growing on the
shells of mid-intertidal limpets. Some of these are very
similar morphologically.
