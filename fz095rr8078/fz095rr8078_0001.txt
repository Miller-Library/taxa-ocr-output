ABSTRACT
Small green algae are commonly observed growing only on the
backs of mid-intertidal limpets. A closer examination was made of
this relationship.
Several different green algae were found growing on the shells
of mid-intertidal limpets. Of these, Percursaria dawsonii (Hollenberg
& Abbott, 1968), and two species of Enteromorpha (Link, 1820) are
morphologically very similar.
The most heavily foliated limpets were found living on vertical
landward faces of wave-exposed rocks between +1 and +4 feet of Mean
Lower Low Water. Fronds of one species of Enteromorpha, labelled
E. sp.2, achieved greater length at sites which were more exposed to
waves than where wave action was less severe.
Enteromorpha sp.» did not survive on limpet shells which were
permanently affixed to mid-tidal rocks. In culture, E. sp., continued
to grow on these empty shells. Additionally, E. sp.» grew in culture
on granite, plastic, wood, Pollicipes plates, Mytilus shell, and free¬
floating in the culture medium.
A procedure for statistically measuring and comparing the cells
of these algae is described and the relationship of one alga to its
hosts is discussed.
