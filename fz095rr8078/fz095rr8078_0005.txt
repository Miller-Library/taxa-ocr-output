side of wave-exposed rocks.
In 11 transects taken at four Monterey Peninsula sites:
Mussel Point, Point Pinos, Pescadero Point, and Stillwater
Cove; E. sp.» was found growing only on the shells of
mid-tidal limpets and occasionally in the furrows between
plates of Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby, 1833) or among
the ridges of Tetraclita squamosa rubescens (Darwin, 1854)
Enteromorpha sp., was never observed growing on rocks,
other algae, invertebrates other than previously specified,
or free-floating in tide pools.
As a rough estimate of differences among the growing
conditions at each site, maximum frond length of E. sp.
was measured by haphazardly selecting 10 long fronds from
limpets at each site and recording the longest frond in
each group (Figure 4).
Limpets found harboring E. sp.» include Collisella
limatula (Carpenter, 1864); C. scabra (Gould, 1846);
C. digitalis (Rathke, 1833); C. pelta (Rathke, 1833);
Notoacmea scutum (Rathke, 1833); and Lottia gigantia
(Sowerby, 1834). All these limpets were taken from the
mid-intertidal zone extending from +1 to +4 feet of
Mean Lower Low Water.
In culture, cut E. sp., fronds attached and grew on
granite, plastic, wood, and sterilized limpet shell frag-
ments, and grew free-floating in the culture medium.
The spores of E. sp., settled and grew on sterilized
ytilus, Tetraclita, and limpet shell fragments, as well as
granite, and plastic petri dishes (Figure 5). Qualitatively,
