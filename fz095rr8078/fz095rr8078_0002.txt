INTRODUCTION
The presence of green algae growing on the shells of
intertidal molluscs has been observed by many investigat-
ors (Setchell and Gardner, 1920; Smith, 1944; Schlumpberger,
1979). Some algae, most notably Percursaria dawsonii (Hollenberg &
Abbott 1968), are described as virtually host-specific to
some of these molluscs. (Hollenberg and Abbott, 1968).
The nature of this epizoic relationship has never
been described. Recently Schlumpberger (1979) surveyed
the microalgae growing on the tiny mollusc, Tricolia
pulloides (Carpenter, 1865), but no work has been done
regarding the green algae of the larger limpets.
This short project was undertaken to identify the
green algae found on the shells of some mid-tidal limpets
and to investigate some of the parameters governing this
relationship.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three transects were taken along lines of sight at each
location. Beginning at the uppermost boundary between sand
or rock and terrestrial vegetation, samples of all
Enteromorpha species and other green algae whose identity
was not readily apparent were taken by hand. If algae
was found on a mollusc shell, the animal was taken intact.
All sampling was done at low tide and lower limit
of transects was determined by water level. This ranged
from -1.5 115 May 1980) to +1.3 (24 May 1980) feet of
Mean Lower Low Water.
Transect width varied from a few feet to several feet
