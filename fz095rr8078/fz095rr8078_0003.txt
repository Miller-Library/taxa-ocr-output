depending on terrain and quantities of acceptable samples
found. Samples were marked according to location.
Tide level, weather conditions, and time of day were re¬
corded for each transect.
Algae were identified according to standard taxonomic
procedure with the following exceptions. Because differen¬
tiation among three of the algae was very difficult, more
accurate methods of identification were required. Cell
dimensions were recorded accurately and systematically for
20 cells from each alga in question. Cell length was
always recorded along the axis of the frond and width across
the frond. For each alga, mean cell length and width were
computed and statistics utilized to determine significant
differences among the samples.
The most prolific alga found on the limpets was select-
ed for further investigation. This was a species of
Enteromorpha (Link, 1820) which was given the label,
Enteromorpha species (abbreviated E. sp.2).
Determination offood of limpets was by microscopic
analysis of gut contents performed immediately after
eating was observed.
Kenic cultures of algae were obtained by isolating
individual plants in 10 ml petri dishes. To each was
added 5 ml of sea water filtered at 0.45 um and 1 ml of
Provasoli's nutrient solution modified with 2.40 ugei-:of
NaMoo and 3.73 ug'1" of Cuso. In addition, 0.5 ml Geo.
and 1 ml penicillin solution were added to control diatom
and bacteria proliferation. Cultures were maintained at
15° C. Photoperiod was 10 hours/day of 41 microeinsteins
