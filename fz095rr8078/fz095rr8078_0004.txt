In all cases where algae growth was monitored on the
limpet shells, the soft parts of the limpets were removed
first.
Where shells were affixed to granite in the intertidal,
Poxy Putty (Permalite Plastics, Newport Beach, CA) was
used as a strong water-proof adhesive.
RESULT:
Several different green algae were observed on mid-
tidal limpets. They were identified as Rhizoclonium
implexum (Kutz, 1845), two species of Ulva (Linnaeus, 1753),
Percursaria dawsonii, Enteromorpha intestinalis ((L.)Link,
1820), and two undescribed species of Enteromorpha
(cf. E. flexuosa ((Roth)J. Agardh, 1883)).
Measurements of cell dimensions from Percursaria
dawsonii, Enteromorpha sp.j, and E. sp.2 are tabulated in
figure 1. Statistical analysis of mean cell lengths using
pair-wise associations and the Student's t-test confirmed
the presence of a significant difference at the .05 level
between E. sp., and both E. sp., and P. dawsonii cell lengths.
Analysis of cell widths failed to confirm a significant
difference between any two algae species.
These data are plotted graphically in figures 2 and 3,
and indicate that cell size should only be one of several
criteria used to discriminate among these algae.
The most abundant algae found growing exclusively on
limpet backs were (in descending order) Enteromorpha sp.
Percursaria dawsonii, and E. sp.. For all these algae
the most heavily foliated limpets were found on the landward
