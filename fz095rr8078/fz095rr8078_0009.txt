and plant morphology among these species which all occur
on the same limpets, it was not always appareat which was being
observed. Compounding this problem was the lack in the
literature of described species of Enteromorpha which
corresponded to the algae being collected (Setchell and
Gardner, 1920; Smith, 1944; Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976).
The statistical analyses which were performed on the
cell dimensions of these algae aided only partially in
identification within the group. Larger sample sizes of cell
measurements are needed from these species to determine
whether they are, in fact, new or different species of
Enteromorpha.
As with any organism of such small stature, identifica-
tion in the field was difficult. Especially within the
infinitely irregular terrain of the rocky intertidal, any
transect which fails to uncover such a tiny alga must be
viewed with cautious skepticism.
Finally, achieving sporulation in culture was successÂ¬
ful only once. More often, fronds matured, but rather than
releasing their spores, they retained them effecting in situ
germination and gross polymorphism of the fronds. Possible
reasons for this include undetected variations in temper-
ature, amount of light, or fixed nitrogen levels in the
culture environment (Yarich, 1976). Since the incidence
of sporulation in culture and a further observation of
sporulation in the field coincided closely with a new moon
and a full moon, respectively, the possibility of lunar
periodicity as described by Smith (1947) for Ulva exists
and merits further investigation.
