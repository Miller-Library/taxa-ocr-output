themselves from the brunt of the crashing waves. Thus,
occurrence of E. sp.» only on parts of the rock not in
direct confrontation with oncoming waves may indicate
that any algae germinating on more exposed surfaces is
rapidly eroded.
The pitted shell tops of the mid-tidal limpets seem
necessary to provide the proper surface for E. sp..
since the smooth granite rock of the Monterey Peninsula
was found to be an unsuitable substrate for firm attachment.
The eroded top layers of limpet shells, termed the intrita¬
calx by D'Attilio and Radwin (1971), would be acting in a
similar fashion to specialized substrates such as various-
ly textured rocks associated with Enteromorpha species in
the Netherlands (Nienhuis, 1969) and at the North Sylt
Wadden Sea, Germany (Gertraud, 1976).
Finally, in wave-protected, but highly washed areas
where limpets are found, E. sp.» most likely occurs nowhere
but on limpet backs because of predation. This conclusion
is in agreement with Southward (1956) who found that
limpets eat virtually all the Enteromorpha around them
except that which is on their backs. Any of thesegalgae
that manages to develop away from the limpets and escape
their predation must still escape predation by foraging
Tegula and many other herbivorous mid-tidal invertebrates.
Several problems were encountered in the course of
this research. Differentiation among the two undescribed
Enteromorpha species and Percursaria dawsonii was a slow
tedious procedure. Because of the similarities in cell size
