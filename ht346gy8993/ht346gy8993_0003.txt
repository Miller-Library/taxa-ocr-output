On the day of the last collection, snail densities of each study
area were determined by removing the algae in 10 randomly selected
16 cm" areas in each study area. Densities were determined by the
number of snails per gm of dry weight of algae dried at 60* cen¬
tigrade for 12 hours.
The epiphytes were identified by Dr. I. A. Abbott. Grazing
tracks were identified at 30X magnification under a dissecting mi-
croscope by comparisions with known grazing tracks made on pieces of
Rhodoglossum affine by herbivorous gastropods kept in the lab.
RESULT
As figure 1 indicates, the largest percentage of frond area
examined was covered by the green alga, Endophyton, which grows
into the cuticle and cortex of the fronds, and by dense growths of
pennate diatoms which seemed to be imbedded in the cuticle. Pennate
diatoms were also found in other areas under the compound micro¬
scope, but only the dense growths (illustration 2) were clearly
visible as shiny specks under the dissecting microscope. Covering
a much smaller percentage of frond area examined were: the green
algae, Pseudodictyon sp. and Enteromorpha sp.; blue-green algae
growing in cocoid clusters; a filamentous red alga, Acrochaetium sp.;
a small coralline red alga; and centric diatoms. As figure 2 illus¬
trates, Endophyton was found mainly low on the fronds while the
dense pennate diatom growths were found mainly on the upper portions
of the frond area examined.
