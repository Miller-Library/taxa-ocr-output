ABSTRACT
Grazing pressure on the epiphytes on the fronds of the interÂ¬
tidal red alga, Rhodoglossum affine, was manipulated by adding and
removing herbivorous gastropods. The green alga, Endophyton, and
dense pennate diatom populations were found to be the most abundant
epiphytes in percentage of frond area covered. The primary grazers
were found to be the prosobranch gastropods, Tricolia pulloides,
Barleeia haliotiphila, Tegula funebralis, and Tegula brunnea.
Grazing by T. pulloides and B. haliotiphila was found to reduce the
percentage of frond area covered by dense growths of pennate diatoms.
