TION
A major effect of grazing on the marine community was previous¬
ly found to be the selective elimination of foliose macrophytes
(Foreman, 1977). Grazing also appears to be an important factor in
controlling the overall abundance of algae in the high intertidal
community (Cubit, 1975) and in keeping rock surfaces free of lit¬
toral diatom populations (Castenholz, 1961). The purpose of this
study is to provide some information of the relationships between
herbivorous gastropod grazers and the epiphytic microalgae growing
on the fronds of the erect, red macroalga, Rhodoglossum affine
(Harv.) Kylin, in the rocky intertidal community.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
This study was conducted in the rocky intertidal zone near
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, within the research reserva¬
tion around the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in May.
1979 (illustration 1). Four 39 by 39 cm study areas were marked off
on two vertical rock faces in the mid zone of Rhodoglossum affine at
the same tidal height of 1.5 to 3.0 feet above mean low low water on
the shoreward faces of the rocks. Ninety-five percent of the area in
this zone was covered by R. affine, while the remaining 5 % consisted
of granite substrate and other erect red algae: Gigartina papillata
(C. Agardh) J. Agardh, Gelidium sp., and Iridea sp.
Inclusion and exclusion fences 3 inches high were made of resin
