and these dense pennate diatom populations were found mainly on the
upper portions of the frond area which was examined (fig. 2). At
the same time of this study, Mooers (1979) found that pennate diatoms
make up 90 - 95 % of the diet of T. pulloides, and Foster (1979)
found tha T. pulloides will move to the upper portions of algal
fronds under optimum conditions. All of these findings seem to
support the hypothesis that the grazing of T. pulloides and B. halio-
tiphila reduces the percentage of frond area covered by a dense growth
of pennate diatoms and suggests that T. pulloides moves out to the
upper portions of the fronds because that is where its major food
source is very abundant.
SUMMAR)
1. Grazing pressure on the epiphytes on the fronds of the intertidal
red alga, Rhodoglossum affine, was manipulated by adding and re-
moving herbivorous gastropods.
2. The green alga, Endophyton, and dense pennate diatom populations
were found to be the most abundant Ã©piphytes in percentage of frond
area covered.
3. The primary grazers were found to be the prosobranch gastropods,
Tricolia pulloides, Barleeia haliotiphila, Tegula funebralis, and
Tegula brunnea.
4. Grazing by Tricolia pulloides and Barleeia haliotiphila was found
to reduce the percentage of frond area covered by dense growths
of pennate diatoms.
