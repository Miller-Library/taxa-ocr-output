The types of grazing tracks which were identified on the fronds
were the clusters of dots made by either Tricolia pulloides or Bar¬
leeia haliotiphila, and the larger, thin, and somewhat sickle-shaped
tracks made by Tegula funebralis or Tegula brunnea (Phillippi, 1848)
(illustration 3). Figure 2 shows that grazing tracks made by T. pul-
loides and B. haliotiphila were found mainly high on the frond area
examined while grazing tracks made by Tegula sp. were found all over.
In the area where the grazers were removed, the percentage of
frond area examined bearing Tricolia pulloides and Barleeia halio-
tiphila grazing tracks was significantly lower than its field con-
trol (fig. 3), while the percentage of frond area examined which
was densely covered by diatoms was significantly higher than its
field control (fig. 4). Figure 5 shows that when compared to its
field control, this same area had no significant change in the per¬
centage of frond area which was covered by other epiphytes during
this time period.
The relationship of Barleeia haliotiphila and Tricolia pulloides
grazing tracks with the dense pennate diatom growths is shown in
figure 6 where the study area with a high percentage of T. pulloides
and B. haliotiphila grazing tracks had a low percentage of dense pen-
nate diatom cover, while the area with a low percentage of B. halio-
tiphila and T. pulloides grazing tracks had a correspondingly high
percentage of dense diatom cover.
Figure 7 shows that the study area where the snails were re¬
moved did have a significantly lower density of Tricolia pulloides
