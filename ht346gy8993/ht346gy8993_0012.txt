1. Histogram of epiphytic abundance (measured in % of frond area)
on fronds which were collected in the control study areas.
2.
Histogram showing the vertical distribution of the epiphytes
and grazing tracks found on R. affine fronds. The solid bar
denotes that it was found only on the bottom portion of the frond;
the striped bar denotes that it was found only on the top portion
of the frond area examined; and the white bar indicates that it
was found all over the frond area examined.
Graph plotting the % of frond area bearing T. pulloides and B.
haliotiphila grazing tracks over time in the low snail density
study area and its control. X is the mean for all the fronds
collected on weeks 1, 2, and 3 1/2. The bars denote the standard
of error. (p .02).
4. Graph plotting the % of frond area covered by dense pennate
diatom growths over time in the low snail density study area
and its control. X is the mean for all the fronds collected
on weeks 1, 2, and 3 1/2. The bars denote the standard of
error (p.001).
