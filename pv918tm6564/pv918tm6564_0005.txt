with filtered (0.45 micron millipored) sea water. C uptake
was similar in whole water controls to that in inoculated
controls, so that cell concentrations were assumed to be
similar. All BOD bottles were directly inoculated with the
appropriate amount and concentration of Picloram or acetone.
Clear bottles were incubated for 6 hours in a Doty
incubator (Doty 1959) and dark bottles in a nearby chamber.
Ihe temperature of water surrounding the bottles was maintained
at approximately 15 degrees centigrade.
Measurements of respiration were made by following the
decrease in dissolved oxygen in darkened 60 milliliter
glass-stoppered bottles. These were inoculated with 20
milliliters of natural composition culture, siphoned full
of filtered (0.45 micron millipored) sea water, and injected
with the appropriate amount of herbicide.or acetone. hey
were incubated for 6 hours at a temperature of about 15 degrees
centigrade.
RESULTS
Measurements of gross primary production were first made
by determining the amounts of dissolved oxygen in light and
dark bottles after incubation in four concentrations of
Picloram, O.OOl parts per billion, O.1 ppb, 10 ppb, and 1000 ppb.
