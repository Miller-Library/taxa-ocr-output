device (Van Dorn 1956). The sea water was either directly
siphoned from the Van Dorn into the BOD bottles to be used
for determinations of photosynthetic rate, or, alternately
transferred into a 5 gallon plastic carbuoy which was brought
back to the laboratory, where siphoning into BOD bottles was
immediately begun.
Cultures were established using tows made with a number
25 phytoplankton net at approximately the same depth. Un
returning to the laboratory, the tows were immediately diluted
with enriched sea water (Institute of Marine Resources culture
medium). They were kept in 2 liter fernbach flasks in a water
bathsof 15 degrees centigrade with constant lighting.
Samples were preserved from tows,and dominant phytoplankton
identified every three days. The phytoplankton community
composition is presented in Table I.
Measurements:
Measurements of photosynthesis were made using the
oxygen light/dark bottle (Gran 1927) and C1" (Doty 1954)
techniques. Dissolved oxygen was determined by a modified
Winkler method (Parsons and Strickland 1968). Clear 300
milliliter biological oxygen demand bottles were used for
culture flasks. Acetone controls at the concentrations which
affected photosynthesis were run in the same size bottles and
measured by radioactive carbon uptake. They were inoculated
with 10 milliliters of natural composition culture and filled
