My thanks go to Dr. Malvern Gilmartin, Dr. Isabella A.
Abbott, and Dr. John H. Phillips, Jr., for their invaluable
advice. In addition, I am indebted to Mr. Harry Agammalion
for providing me with a supply of Picloram and much information
regarding its use.
This work was supported in part by the Undergraduate
Research Participation Program of the National Science
Foundation, Grant 464-5878.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Picloram:
Ihe herbicide was in a commercial formulation called
Tordon 22K and dissolved in acetone at a concentration of
2.36 x 10â€”+ milligrams/milliliter. It was diluted with
filtered (0.45 micron millipored) sea water. At concentrations
of approximately 2.36 x 10  milligrams/milliliter and
above, a calcium salt precipitate in sea water was noted.
Acetone controls were run parallel to those concentrations
which were found to effect photosynthesis and respiration.
Sampling:
Samples were taken almost daily from the same location
in Monterey Bay. Whole water samples were taken at a depth
of approximately 124 meters with a 5 liter Van Dorn sampling
