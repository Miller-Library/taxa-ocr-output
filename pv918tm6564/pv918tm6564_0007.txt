concentrations of Picloram indicate beyond doubt that photosyn-
thesis is depressed at a concentration of 1000 ppb and almost
eliminated at a concentration of 100,000 ppb (see figure 2).
However, photosynthesis is also somewhat depressed by acetone
at those concentrations. The relative depression of photoÂ¬
synthesis by Picloram and acetone indicate that Picloram has
a distinct effect beyond the acetone in which it is dissolved.
However, one must consider the possibility that phytoplankton
incubated in acetone may not react the same way to Picloram
as healthy phytoplankton.
Respiration determinations (see figure 3) again show too
much variability to be statistically significant. Although
uncorrected for bacterial respiration, the means indicate that
respiration rate is increased, but probably because of incubation
in acetone.
Such results indicate that Picloram acts primarily on the
chlorophyll or some other substance involved only in photosynthesis,
as opposed to other pesticides, like DDT, which affect both
respiration and photosynthesis, and might therefore be affecting
membrane structure.
