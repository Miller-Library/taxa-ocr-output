INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects
of the herbicide Picloram on rates of photosynthesis and
respiration in the natural marine phytoplankton community
found in Monterey Bay, California, during May, 1969. It was
hypothesized that photosynthetic rates would be depressed
at concentrations in parts per billion by weight, and that
respiration rates would be increased at similar concentrations.
Picloram, or Tordon, as it is commercially known, is a
herbicide with a half-life of up to a year. Usually, its
targets are perennial, broad-leaved plants and stands of
brush, in which it accumulates in new growth. Although
used frequently as a soil sterilant, it is also used to
eliminate growing plants. Despite the fact that Picloram
was not used in Monterey County during 1968 (because of its
residual nature and because the entire supply was purchased
by the United States government), Picloram was chosen for
this study because of its use as a defoliant by the United
States in Vietnam, where application rates may be double to
quadruple those in the U.S. At such high application rates,
monsoon rains might raise herbicide concentrations in lakes
and inshore waters of Southeast Asia to levels which might
significantly effect phytoplankton primary production over
long periods of time.
