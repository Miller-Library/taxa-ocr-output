ABSTRACT
Studies were made of the effects of Picloram at various
concentrations on whole water samples and cultures established
from tows from Monterey Bay, California, using the C and
oxygen light/dark bottle techniques. The rate of net
photosynthesis was depressed approximately 10% by a herbicide
concentration of one part per million by weight and 89% by a
herbicide concentration of one hundred parts per million by
weight. No significant effects of the herbicide on respiration
was detected at these concentrations.
