When variable results were obtained, a fifth concentration of
100,000 ppb was added. These results are presented in Table
II.
Oxygen and ++ uptake determinations were used to measure
photosynthetic rate at concentrations which appeared to effect
the phytoplankters. Since C uptake measures a value much
closer to net than gross primary production, net primary
production was determined using dissolved oxygen measurements.
These results are presented in Tables III and IV.
Acetone controls were run at concentrations parallel to
those which affected photosynthesis using C uptake measurements
These results are presented in Table V.
Respiration was measured at selected concentrations
affecting photosynthesis, by determining decrease in dissolved
oxygen. Acetone controls were run parallel to the Ficloram
determinations. These results are presented in Tables VI and
VII.
DISCUSSION
Ihe results from the initial oxygen determinations of
gross primary production (see figure 1), although far too
variable to be statistically significant, the results suggested
a depression of photosynthesis at 1000 ppb and 100,000 ppb.
