Preliminary notes on the growth rates of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tegula funebralis : Exact'>Tegula funebralis</span> and
of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea asmi : Exact'>Acmaea asmi</span>
I. Installation of cages:
The majority of the time this quarter was spent on this
phase of our project. The installation of the cages proved
to be a more difficult task than was originally intended
and consequently took more time. Our initial populations of
both species were able to escape within two weeks, but the holes
in the cageshave since been closed. We now feel that
we have an adequate means of confining the animals, one which
will withstand the environment and one which does not
adversely affedtthe population; i.e. five <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. funebralis</span>
died over a period of three months. However each was found
stuck between the cage fittings and the ground, and we
felt that their death was caused by being caught in an
attempt to escape and not, therefore, having access to
food, etc.
II. Marking
Our original marking system proved to be unsatisfactory
due to erosion of the shell apex; subsequently we marked
T. funebralis on the sides of the shell. A. asmi's markings
proved adequate. Our process is as follows: 1) applying
a base coat of red nail polish; 2) writing a number on this
base with Indian ink; 3) Covering with one or two coats
of clear polish; 4) renewing the numbers and top coat
at least once a month.
In addition, we plan to try etching numbers into the
shells next quarter and cutting the lip of the T. funebralis
III. Measurement:
Due to additional time spent on the above preliminary steps
adequate measurement of growth was not completed. The method
used was to measure the largest basal diameter of the shells;
however, the results were poor as for over two hundred
T. funebralis marked, of which we have subsequent
196
O
measurements of twenty-five, only five increased their size
measureably, each by .5 mm and, having measured these animals
many times, it has been concluded that .5 mm is our error range.
Not a single a. asmi grew a measureable amount although we
measured both widest basal diameter and length from base to
apex along the widest curve.
The loss of population made it extremely hard to view a
large sample size over the entire quarter. As stated above,
we plan to scratch T. funebralis' lips amd to measure the
distance traveled by the mark. In this manner a more predise
measurement will be obtained. As for <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. asmi,</span> we're still
thinking of a manner to obtain precise measurements and
have not been successful.

Dear Dr. Abbott,
Both Willie and I apologize for not having sent you some
preliminary data sooner. However, after we last saw you,
time has been so scarce (Thanksgiving, finals, etd.) that
this is the first change we've had to sit down tomarize
our work this quarter.
Although our results are preliminary if that, hopefully
the following will give you a better idea of what we've
spent the past quarter working on.
Also... have an enjoyable and profitable trip next
quarter, and a Merry Christmas to you and your family.
Sincerely,
Wille
