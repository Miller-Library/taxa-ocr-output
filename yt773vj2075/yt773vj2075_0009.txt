For rugosity indices, conformed distances ranged from 1.96 to 3.60 meters, with
corresponding ratios of 1.04 and 1.91. Means per area ranged from 1.38 through 1.56
(Fig. 10). There were no significant differences between areas (P=.72, Table 1)
Discussion
The study attempted to answer the question of how representative, not how
identical, the Hewatt transect is of the rocky intertidal at HMS. Considering the high
spatial variation in this environment, some differences will always be present. However, in
order to be representative, comparisons of the Hewatt transect and other areas should
show no more differences than the other areas do when compared among themselves. A
consistent pattern of differences between the Hewatt transect and adjacent areas would
indicate the transect is not representative at all.
Post-hoc Tukey's tests were used because they have the ability to analyze all
possible pair-wise combinations of areas. These tests showed no significant differences
between any areas for Serpulorbis and Endocladia. For Anthopleura, two out of six
possible comparisons were significant and neither of them involved Hewatt. The
significant difference (P=.020) noted in the overall ANOVA occurred because West was
significantly different from both East l and East2.
The significant differences between West and East l/East2 for Anthopleura are
most likely related to microhabitat variation. West is located just prior to the seaward rim
of the intertidal, and probably receives considerably higher wave exposure. Anecdotally, it
is also host to another species of anemone, Anthopleura xanthogrammica. A.
xanthogrammica is typical of wave exposed areas (Ricketts et al. 1985). The two East
