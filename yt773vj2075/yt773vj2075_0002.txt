Introduction
In the 1930's, Hewatt (1933) conducted an ecological survey of a permanent
transect he established in the protected rocky intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station. This
study provided extensive information on species distribution and abundance. Sagarin and
Gilman (1993) relocated the transect and resampled 19 of Hewatt's original quadrats.
Their data showed significant changes for many species. Notably, many species which
increased in abundance had geographic distributions with northern boundaries at Cape
Mendocino ("southern" species), and the species that decreased in abundance had
geographic distributions with southern boundaries at Point Conception ("northern'
species). Concurrent increases in sea surface temperatures implicated global climate
change as a possible cause of these changes (Barry et al. 1995). This result has important
implications for the potential environmental impacts of global warming in intertidal
communities.
While many anecdotal observations of changes in species abundance have been
made, quantitative studies such as this are necessary to provide robust evidence of
environmental change. Unfortunately, with limited amounts of reference data such as
Hewattâ€™s, these studies are rare. Furthermore, they are confounded by natural variation.
In order to make inferences concerning potentially crucial changes occurring in large
areas, it is necessary to understand the spatial and temporal scales at which nature varies.
The rocky intertidal is a highly variable environment. A great deal of work
conducted in Australia (Underwood and Chapman1996, 1998; Underwood 1998) has
focused on this problem, because anthropogenic stress on the southern coastlines of
Australia is increasing and may be affecting intertidal communities. The purpose of this
