areas, by contrast, receive far less wave exposure than West. The substratum in these
areas tends to have many more shallow crevices, where A. sola is most abundant. It is
interesting to note that the statistical analyses for differences in substrate rugosity did not
differ among areas (Fig. 10, Table 1)
The low abundance of Endocladia found in Hewatt (Fig. 6) is due to sampling
artifact: nearly all quadrats fell on inappropriate tidal heights. Fig. 7 shows a skewed
distribution between quadrat count and average tidal height for each of the four areas.
Most of the zero values occur in Hewatt below 2.5' above MLLW. Endocladia is
abundant between fairly specific upper and lower boundaries, and the lower boundary is
approximately 2.5' above MLLW (Simons and Leydig 1996). If quadrats with zero
percent cover extended along the x-axis of Fig. 7, I would conclude that the dearth of
Endocladia was unique to Hewatt. However, as the zero values are only found below the
lower boundary for the alga, and since many Hewatt quadrats are found at or below this
height, it is more likely that portions of Hewatt are simply too low for Endocladia.
While these tests show that the Hewatt transect is representative of the intertidal
area at Hopkins Marine Station, they raise the general question of spatial heterogeneity in
the intertidal. Variation occurs among areas and among transects-within-areas, but based
on the components of total variation, the greatest variation occurs between quadrats.
This is due to differences in microhabitats that average out at larger spatial scales.
While there is a great deal of small scale variability in the intertidal zone at
Hopkins Marine Station, there is no consistent pattern suggesting the Hewatt transect is
much different from surrounding areas. Considering these results, it is possible to
extrapolate that the environmental processes responsible for intertidal change since 1933
