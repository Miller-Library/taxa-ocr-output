Fig. 1. Aerial map of Hopkins Marine Station showing the location of the Hewatt
Transect. Dotted lines indicate the approximate locations of the four areas under study:
West, Hewatt, East1, and East2.
Fig. 2. Photograph of the study site taken at low tide.
Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the two factor nested design with areas, transects-
within-areas, and quadrat replicates.
Fig. 4. The relationship between the F-distribution for Ho, the F-distribution for Hj, a,
and B. When Ho is true, the probability of incorrectly rejecting it is a, and when Hi is true
the probability of incorrectly rejecting it is ß. Note that without a specified alternative
hypothesis, ß is unknown. However, the relationship between a and ß indicates that an
increase in a will decrease B.
Fig. 5. The distribution of Anthopleura. Each bar represents the mean of one transect.
Error bars are Standard Errors.
Fig. 6. The distribution of Endocladia. Each bar represents the mean of one transect.
Error bars are Standard Errors.
Fig. 7. The distribution of Serpulorbis. Each bar represents the mean of one transect.
Error bars are Standard Errors
Fig. 8. Correlation between Endocladia percent cover per quadrat and average tidal
height per quadrat. Lower than two feet above MLLW is considered low zone, which is
an inappropriate area in which to sample Endocladia.
