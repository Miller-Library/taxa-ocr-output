previous years, it was present as a solitary, primarily subtidal species, but recently it has
become extremely abundant in the intertidal zone, forming mats of coiled tubes. The third
species I sampled was the alga Endocladia. While Hewatt (1933) did not survey algae,
some understanding of the variation in algal cover is useful because algae is often the
predominate occupant of space in the intertidal, and plays an important role in determining
the local animal community. Simons and Leydig (1996) found a 1 ft. downward shift in the
Endocladia zone compared to data from the early 1960's (Glynn 1965), as well as
associated changes in its assemblage of organisms. This suggests Endocladia may be an
indicator species for intertidal change.
Materials and Methods:
This study was conducted in the sheltered rocky intertidal area west of Bird Rock
at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA, USA (36° 37' N, 121° 54' W). This
study site was determined by the location of the Hewatt transect. The transect runs 100
yards perpendicular to shore and is marked by brass bolts. I randomly sampled within an
approximately 90 x 15 meter area that contained the Hewatt transect and compared it to
three adjacent areas of comparable size and tidal height. The four areas were designated
West, Hewatt, East1, and East2 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Areas closer to Bird Rock were excluded
as they incorporated primarily high intertidal areas. The four study areas are crossed by
two permanent channels that run parallel to shore. The zone is also protected along its
seaward margin by high rocks, preventing high wave exposure in the interior.
