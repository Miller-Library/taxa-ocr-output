Anthopleura densities ranged from 0-23 per m’ (Fig. 5). There were no significant
differences between transects-within-areas (P= 16, Table 1), but there were significant
differences between areas (P=.02, Table 1). Post-hoc comparisons showed that the
Hewatt area did not differ from either of the other three, the only significant differences
were between West and East1 and West and East2 (Table 2). Furthermore, 77% of the
summed variance components was associated with residual, or among-quadrat, variation.
while only 4% was associated with transects-within-areas, and 19% was associated with
areas (Fig. 9).
Percent cover of Endocladia ranged from 0-93% (Fig. 6). There were highly
significant differences among transects-within-areas, especially in West and Hewatt (Fig.
6, Table 1). However, there were no significant differences between areas (P- 23, Table
1). Post-hoc comparisons among areas revealed no significant differences between any of
the areas (Table 2). Fisty percent of the summed variance components was associated
with among-quadrat variation, 39% was associated with transects-within-areas, and 11%
was associated with areas (Fig. 9).
Serpulorbis densities ranged from 0-856 individuals per m’ (Fig. 7). There were
no significant differences among areas (P= 15, Table 1), or among transects-within-areas
(P=.15, Table 1, 2). Sixty-eight percent of the summed variance components was
associated with among-quadrat variation, 1 1% was associated with transects-within-areas,
and 23% was associated with areas (Fig. 9).
