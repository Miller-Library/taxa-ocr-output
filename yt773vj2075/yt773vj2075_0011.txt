have acted on the whole intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station. While these processes are
far from cle
iportant to note that temporal variation across sixty years was far
r, it is
more significant than spatial variation in this study. This provides compelling evidence
that although stochastic variation is always a problem, carefully studied transects can act
as indicators for large-scale change.
