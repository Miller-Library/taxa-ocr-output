Abstract
The Hewatt transect is a permanently marked area perpendicular to shore running through
the protected rocky intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station. Species abundance data
collected in 1933-37 and 1993-95 showed significant differences for many species during
the intervening years. In order to determine how representative the Hewatt transect is of
the protected rocky intertidal zone at Hopkins, a 90 x 15 m area surrounding the Hewatt
transect was compared to three adjacent areas of the same size. Three organisms were
sampled in two or three 15-m transects within each of the four areas. Ten quadrats were
counted in each transect. Additionally, the substrate rugosity for each area was measured.
For Anthopleura sola, a solitary anemone, there were significant differences among areas
(P=.02), but not among transects-within-areas (P=. 16). For Serpulorbis squamigerus, a
tube dwelling gastropod, there were no significant differences at either level (P=. 15 and
15). For the alga Endocladia muricata, there were no significant differences among
areas (P=.23), but highly significant differences among transects-within-areas (P.001)
Substrate rugosity showed no significance between areas (P=. 72). These data indicate
that while there are some differences between the Hewatt area and adjacent areas, there is
no evidence that the Hewatt area is non-representative of the HMS intertidal. While the
intertidal zone is certainly not homogeneous, it is possible to conclude that the changes
seen in the 60 year interval were due to significant species abundance change and not
stochastic variation. Additionally, the environmental processes that caused these changes
are likely to have influenced the distribution of organisms across the intertidal zone.
