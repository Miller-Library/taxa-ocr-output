Fig. 9. Components of variance contributing to total variation seen in the three organisms
sampled. Serpulorbis is represented by black, Anthopleura by light gray, and Endocladia
by dark gray. Variance is divided into areas, transects-within-areas, and residual, or
among-quadrat, variance.
Fig. 10. Average substrate rugosity for each area. The height of each bar is the sample
mean. Error bars are Standard Errors.
