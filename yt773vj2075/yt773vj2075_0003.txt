research was to better understand spatial patterns prior to attributing causation for
temporal changes. Natural spatial variation makes anthropogenic impact difficult to
quantify. A number of statistical techniques have been developed to quantify spatial
patterns so that changes can be detected (Underwood 1998). A primary conclusion of
these studies is natural variation is high and spatial patterns are difficult to quantify.
The potential anthropogenic impacts upon the rocky coast of California are also
huge, and spatial variation is equally high. Fu (1995) studied organism abundances at
various spatial scales and found that different species were patchy at different scales.
Considering such high and inconsistent levels of variation, it is appropriate to question
how representative the Hewatt transect may be of the intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine
Station prior to making inferences about environmental change. This study was designed
to address this question by sampling two intertidal invertebrates and one intertidal alga.
The animals I chose are both southern species (Barry et al. 1995) that have significantly
increased in abundance along the Hewatt transect. This makes them particularly
interesting in the context of climate change hypotheses. In order to conclude that
southern species are able to "invade" the intertidal zone because of rising sea surface
temperatures, it is necessary to show that increased abundances noted along the Hewatt
transect are representative of areas elsewhere in the intertidal zone.
Two of the study organisms are sessile invertebrates. The anemone Anthopleura
sola is abundant and widespread in the mid-intertidal zone. A sessile predator during high
tide, it retracts its tentacles and its shell-covered body wall becomes visible when tides are
low. Serpulorbis squamigerus is a low-intertidal tube building snail. It is a suspension
feeder, spinning webs of mucus to catch particles as they drift by (Morris et al. 1980). In
