they fell exactly on the edge of the quadrat. For Endocladia, percent cover was estimated
using a 25m' quadrat subdivided into 25 5 x 5 cm squares.
For each quadrat sampled, the estimated average tidal height was measured using a
surveyor's transit and stadia rod. Measurements were cross-referenced with a brass bolt
that marks the beginning of the Hewatt transect at 3.82 feet above MLLW.
Physical Measurements
In addition to ecological sampling, physical topography measurements were taken
in each area. A straight line distance of 1.88 meters was measured with plumb lines hung
from a leveled PVC pipe. The surface distance between those points was determined
using fine link chain that conformed to irregularities and cracks in the rock. This length,
divided by 1.88, was used as an index of the substrate rugosity. Five replicate lengths
were haphazardly placed per area at random compass bearings.
Data Analysis
Cochran's tests for heterogeneity of variances were performed on the within-
transect variances for Serpulorbis, Anthopleura, and Endocladia. For each organism, the
test was significant (PS.05), indicating their variances were too heterogeneous to meet the
assumptions of ANOVA. To decrease the heterogeneity of variances, Serpulorbis data
were log transformed (log (x+1)). Anthopleura data were square root transformed
(V(x+.5)). Endocladia data were arcsin transformed (sin (x)). After transformation,
variances were no longer heterogeneous.
