Study design and Sampling
A preliminary study was conducted to determine the optimal quadrat size for A.
sola and S. squamigerus. Both animals were counted in haphazardly placed quadrats of
25-m and 1-m sizes. Precision, a measure of repeatability, was calculated by the
following equation:
P-SE/X
where SE is the Standard Error of the sample and X is the sample mean.
For S. squamigerus, 25-m quadrats gave the greatest precision, while for A. sola
1-mâ€™ quadrats were more precise. The alga Endocladia was surveyed in 25-m" quadrats
without any comparison to other quadrat sizes.
This study used a nested Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) design (Fig. 3). For each
species, two or three 15-m transects were sampled in each of the four areas. Ten quadrats
were randomly located and counted per transect. For Endocladia and Anthopleura, three
transects per area were haphazardly placed through the mid-intertidal zone (approximately
2 - 4 feet above MLLW). Whenever possible, these transects were kept roughly parallel
to the Hewatt transect. For Serpulorbis, two transects were haphazardly placed within the
low zone (approximately -1 to +1.5 feet above MLLW). There was insufficient space for
three non-overlapping low zone transects within each area.
Animals were counted if they fell within the randomly located quadrat. Tube snails
were counted as number of apertures within each quadrat rather than tubes. Individuals
along the edges of a quadrat were counted if their aperture fell inside the quadrat. For A.
sola, a relatively large species, animals were counted as halves on the rare occasion that
