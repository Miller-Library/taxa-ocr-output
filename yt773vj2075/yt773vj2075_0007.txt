The data were analyzed using a two-factor nested ANOVA. The tests were
conducted at q= 10 rather than the more conventional .05 for the following reasons. Two
types of statistical error are possible: Type I occurs when a true null hypothesis (Ho) is
rejected; its probability is a. Type II, with probability B, is the opposite mistake of
retaining an incorrect null hypothesis. Type I errors are more serious in biological
experiments, because the acceptance of an incorrect alternative hypothesis will probably
not lead to further experiments. By contrast, Type II, or the acceptance of an incorrect
null hypothesis, probably will lead to further experiments and the error will be detected.
In this study, a larger a was considered appropriate due to the potential result of
Type I and Type II errors. With Ho of "no differences among areas," Type I error would
conclude the Hewatt transect is not representative of the intertidal at Hopkins Marine
Station when it actually is, and no inferences about the generality of environmental
processes would be made. Conversely, Type II would suggest the Hewatt transect is
representative of the intertidal when it is not, which in this case is an equally serious error.
The probability of Type II error, ß, cannot be specified without a specific (quantitative)
alternative hypothesis (Hi), but it is clear from Fig. 4 that their probabilities are
complementary: an increase in a would decrease ß, and vice versa. For this reason, a
more conservative approach that would balance the likelihood of either error was to set
a=. 10 rather than the conventional .05.
Differences among areas for each species were compared using Tukey's post-hoc
tests.
Rugosity data were analyzed using a single factor ANOVA.
