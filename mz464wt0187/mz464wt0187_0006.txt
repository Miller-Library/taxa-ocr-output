STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
jerked. Several cases were observed where the tail would
not separate from the body. In these cases the tail move-
ment repeatly dislodged the cercaria from the host's skin.
Immediately following tail loss, the cercaria
rhythmatically contracted and elongated.
This behavior
presumably aided the flow of penetration gland enzymes to
the fish skin and/or the scraping action of the oral sucker
spines.
Upon penetration the cercaria would migrate within the
fish through a series of peristaltic motions. The cercaria
migrated to an open space and encysted. Preferred areas
for encystment include the spinal column, orbit and lower
buccal cavity. Encystment of over half of the cercaria is
complete within two days. In areas of high cercarial
infestation, the encystment period seemed to be delayed.
RESULTS
Survey of natural hosts
In the survey of natural hosts the response was
positive if the cercaria demonstrated penetration behavior
within thirty minutes after the introduction of the host.
The cercaria was found to penetrate the following
hosts: Gillichthys mirabilis (Longjaw Mudsucker),
Gasterosteus aculeatus (Threespine Stickleback) and to
a much lesser extent Clinocottus analis (Wooly Sclupin).
