STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
INTRODUCTION
The complicated life cycle of digenetic trematodes
is fascinating. Some have been known to have as many as
five hosts in a typical life cycle (Olsen, 1974). At
Elkhorn Slough a possibly undescribed species of marine
cercaria was discovered in the snail Batallaria attramentaria.
One or many of the common birds in the slough is thought to
be the definitive host. Two of the common fish in the area
are Gillichthys mirabilis, "Longjaw Mudsucker", and
Gasterosteus aculeatus, "Stickleback". The cercaria were
observed to infect both these fish. A preliminary description
of the cercaria was performed as well as studies dealing
with its natural host and penetration behavior in Gillichthys
mirabilis. Also the effect of time and temperature on
the activity and penetration successof the cercaria was
explored.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
The snail Batallaria attramentaria was collected from
Elkhorn Slough and stored in the dark using a tarpaulin
covered aquarium with running ocean water. Gillichthys
mirabilis, "Longjaw Mudsucker", were collected from the
tide pools at Elkhorn Slough with dip nets. Cercaria were
collected by placing three snails in a 45 ml plastic
container positioned 18 cm from a 75 watt incandescent light
source for 1 hour. Cercaria were concentrated by filtering
the water through a 50 micron Nitex filter and gently
