STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
Gillichthye mirabilis when the fish was dissected, the data
was not scored.
The species of the metacercaria was not
known. It was easily distinguishable from the newly formed
metacercaria by both its color and size.
Host penetration must be an energy consuming process.
Since the cercaria does not feed, it must have a limited
energy supply. Consequently, cercaria must find and
penetrate a host before this energy supply is depleted.
If the activity of the cercaria is increased or decreased,
then its rate of energy consumption will rise or lower
respectively. Itwas expected that the less active cercaria
would be able to infect a host for a longer period of time.
This theory was confirmed when a batch of cercaria which was
stored at 0Â° C for 24 hours was observed to penetrate a
Gillichthys mirabilis.
Because of the small sample size in Figure 5, it is
difficult to make any specific conclusions. It is known
that the cercaria have a limited energy resource. After a
certain length of time they will run out of energy and die.
What factors influence this time span? Is there a point
where the cercaria are still alive but no longer can
penetrate or encyst? These are a few questions that may
be answered in a more lengthy study.
Final identification of the cercaria and a complete
life cycle for the trematode is also work that this report
left unfinished.
