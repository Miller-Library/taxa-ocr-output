STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
ACKNOWLEDGMEN
I would like to thank the faculty and staff at Hopkins
Marine Station for a very enjoyable and rewarding quarter.
I would especially like to thank Professor Gary E. Wagenbach
for his steady guidance and open office door. Inside I was
able to gain much strength and inspiration. Special thanks
goes to Kathy French and Faylla Chapman for there constant
smiles as I pestered them for equipment and supplies.
And of course to Dan and Janie - for without them the
slough just would not be quite the same.
