STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
Gillichthys mirabilis and 100 ml of ocean water. Two hours
later the Gillichthys mirabilis was gently washed and placed
in a new container. Two days later the fish were dissected
and the number of cercaria per 1.4 cm of spine was recorded.
Since cercaria concentrated in the spinal column of infected
Gillichthys mirabilis, that area was used as a spot assay
for cercarial penetrations.

Description of cercaria
The cercaria is biocellate and parapleurolophocercous.
The body is covered with minute spines (1 u long) and bears
at least 18 slender long projections. Body measurements
based on 2 electron microscope photographs are: 80 u length,
60 u width.
The square black eyespots are located approximately
one-third the length of the body from the anterior end. The
anterior one-half of the body is clear while the posterior
one-half contains 14 granular gland cells. There are two
sets of spines in the mouth region. (Fig. 1) The most
posterior of these is a set of 17-18 spines arranged in an
elipse and pointing toward the ventral side of the cercaria.
Anterior to these is a second set of 5-6 spines that may be
pointed forward or ventrally as a unit. Both sets are
thought to act as scraping devices during penetration of
the next host. The exits of the penetration gland ducts
