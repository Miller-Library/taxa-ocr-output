at varying temperatures. Activity was measured
by the frequency the cercaria exhibited some
type of swimming behavior. All cercaria were
collected between O and 1 hours of the study
and stored for 1 hour in vials at 20Â°0.
Two hours after collection, the cercaria were
exposed to the temperature change.
