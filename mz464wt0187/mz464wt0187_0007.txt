STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
They seemed to prefer to penetrate the fins rather than the
skin of the fish.
Cercaria did not respond to the following hosts:
Hermissenda crassicornis (Opisthobranchia), Callianass:
californiensis (Callianassidae) and Pachygrapsus crassipes
(Grapsidae).
There was some chance that the respiration of the host
would allow some cercaria to penetrate through the gills or
surrounding structures. However, dissection of all of the
hosts on the latter list revealed no metacercaria three days
after infection.
RESUITS
Cercarial penetration
The success of cercarial penetration is time dependent
with the highest rates during the first few hours. (Fig. 4)
At 20° C, the cercaria began to lose their penetration
ability after approximately 8 hours and by 20 hours it was
down to 4% of its highest value.
Observations were made on cercaria stored at 0° C for
2 days. It took over 24 hours for these cercaria to lose
their penetration ability.
RESULTS
Activity of cercaria
The activity of the cercaria, as assayed by their
frequency of swimming, is both time and temperature
