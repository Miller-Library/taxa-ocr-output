STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
dependent. (Fig. 5) The temperature of 70° C is lethal to
the cercaria after 20 minutes. At 45° C the cercaria remain
alive for 10 hours but lost their activity after 6 hours.
At lower temperatures the cercaria will stay alive for
progressively longer periods of time. The longest living
cercaria was stored at 0° C for 72 hours.

DISCUSSION
The cercaria is very similar to both Parasitictodora
hancocki (Martin 1950) and Stictodora tridactyla (Martin
and Kuntz 1955). One of the major differences in both cases
is the number of flame cells. The flame cell formula for
Parasitictodora hancocki is 2 (313)(3+3)- 24 and the same
for Stictodora tridactyla is 2((3+343).(343-3): 36. The
other major difference is the location of the excretory
bladder exit tube. Both Parasitictodora hancocki and
Stictodora tridactyla have inverted "T" shaped exit tubes
in the tail. An excretory bladder exit tube has never been
observed in the undetermined cercaria.
There was much variability observed in the number of
flame cells and oral spines, and the arrangement of
penetration gland duct exits in the Elkhorn Slough Cercaria.
The experiment to test cercarial penetration was
hindered because some of the Gillichthys mirabilis were
infested with metacercaria when collected. If a large
number of metacercaria were found in or near the spine of
