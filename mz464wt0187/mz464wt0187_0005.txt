are located just anterior to the oral sucker. (Fig. 2)
They are arranged in a 3-4-4-3 pattern as they pass
dorsally under the oral sucker. The measurements of the
ellipsoid oral sucker are: 30-35 u length, 27-32 u width.
The excretory bladder may take a V, Y or oval shape.
40 flame cells, 20 on a side, are connected via ducts to
the excretory bladder. (Fig. 3) The complete duct system
was never satisfactorily determined, so a flame cell
formula is not presented. The flame cell duct system in
the figure was formed by combining results from several
different specimens.
The tail is approximately 325 u long and 16 u wide
and contains two fins. The anterior lateral fin is
133 u long and 44 u wide. The posterior dorsal-ventral
fin is 211u long and 25 u at its widest point. There is
20 u overlap between the posterior part of the lateral fin
and the anterior dorsal part of the dorsal-ventral fin.
The cercaria swims in a zig-zag or spiral motion. It
generally swims upward and then slowly sinks head first.
RESULT
Penetration behavior
Cercarial penetration behavior began when the cercaria
swam 1-4 mm and made contact with the fish. Upon contact.
the cercaria lost its tail. About one-half of the time the
tail would not separate from the body until it actively
