STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
This report did establish that there may be a previously
undescribed cercaria in Elkhorn Slough. In addition it
showed that cercarial penetration of an intermediate host
seems to be limited by the energy previously stored in the
cercaria.
Two species of fish were infected by the cercaria in
this study. In only one of these fish, Gillichthys mirabilis
did metacercaria develop. In Gasterosteus aculeatus the
cercaria would not or could not encyst. The brain case
and spinal column were checked in several different
Gasterosteus aculeatus with the same results--no metacercaria.
The cercaria must have penetrated and then died. Some loose
cell masses were found inside the Gasterosteus aculeatus
to support this hypothesis. If this observation is valid in
the field then Gasterosteus aculeatus may be introduced to
a marine environment and help control trematodes. The fish
would absorb and essentially destroy many cercaria without
allowing the life cycle to continue.
