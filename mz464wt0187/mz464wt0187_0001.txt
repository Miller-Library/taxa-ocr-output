STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
ABSTRACT
A possible new marine cercaria found in the snail
Batallaria attramentaria at Elkhorn Slough, California
was described. A survey was performed on possible inter-
mediate hosts and the cercaria's penetration behavior in
one of them, Gillichthys mirabilis. As the cercaria aged,
its activity and penetration ability decreased. The
duration of successful cercarial penetration was dependent
upon the level of cercarial activity prior to attempted
penetration.
