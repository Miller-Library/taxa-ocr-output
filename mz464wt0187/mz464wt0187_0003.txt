STUDY OF CERCARIAL PENETRATION
washing the cercaria into a beaker. Concentrations as high
as 7000 cercaria/ml were collected and then diluted to a
standard concentration of 1000 cercaria/ml.
Descriptions of cercaria were made by observing live
specimens on a phase contrast microscope and some stained
slide preparations of unshed cercaria. The slides were
of the hepato-pancreas area of infected Batallaria
attramentaria. The snails were fixed with 5% Glutaraldehyde
then 9% Formaldehyde and lastly embedded in JB4 plastic.
A 2  section was cut and stained with methylene blue.
A survey of possible intermediate hosts was conducted
by placing a living host in a 8 cm X 10 cm opened glass
container partially filled with sea water at 20°C and under
constant light. Cercaria were added to bring the final
concentration of cercaria to 100 cercaria/ml. If the host
was relatively small, additional hosts were added to the
container. The host was checked every 10 minutes for 30
minutes for the presence of penetrating cercaria. All
experiments began within 2 hours after cercaria collection.
Penetration behavior was studied using a cross section
of Gillichthys mirabilis placed in sea water under a
dissection microscope. Cercaria were added to the petri
dish and their behavior observed.
Penetration tests were conducted by preparing replicate
samples of cercaria (over 500 cercaria/ml) and placing them
at 20°C under natural light. At designated intervals the
cercaria were placed in a 8 cm finger bowl containing a live
