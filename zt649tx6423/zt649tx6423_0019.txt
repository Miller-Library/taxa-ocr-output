shelled animals, but that body size does not increase as much in
thicker-shelled murphalogies becamse the animal cannut expand its
internal volume faster than the shell is expanding. If this
theory holds true for C. scabra, then the thicker-shelled rider
C scabra do not need as much algae as the lighter-shelled
nonrider Co scahma because, while they are expending the same
amount of energy for shell material annually, the thicker-shelled
ridera have lower metabolic costs because they grow and maintain
a proportionally smallem bady weight.
One could epand on this hypothesis in two ways. Fimst, it
it were shown that rider C. scabra growth rates are food limited,
ne could furthem hypethesite that the decramed fmad
availability is only limiting body sise and shell production
ntiuaa
distribution of shell in relatively thicker layers would simply
be due to the body failing to expand beneath it. On the other
hand riders may inherently lay down thicken shells, perhaps
REEESSItated y an increased expmure to waye astimn and
predation because they are removed from their camouflage and the
protection of rock protrusions. If this is true then the mody
site of the riders is limited by the intemnal volume ar the
shell, and an increase in food availability on the L ainantea
shells would nut increase the riders' body mite.
