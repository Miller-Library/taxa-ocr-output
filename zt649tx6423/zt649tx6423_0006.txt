was used to measure extinction coefficients at o4 nm. and 647
nm, and used in the spectrophotometric equations given by deffrey
and Humphrey, 1975, tw establish the amounts of chlorophyll a and
b present in the acetone solutions; Chlorophyll a - 11.93E4
1.E and Chlorphyll b- 20. E - 5.SOE. These
chlormphyll ampunts indicated the amounts of greem algae present
on the entire shell (Jeffrey and Humphrey 1975).
The shell mass per murface area was used as the measurement
of shell thickness. Mass of the shell was the weight of the L.
gigantes shell after the body had heen completely cut away, the
zhall pat-dried, and all algae had been scraped and bleached gff
it. Shell stuface wam again taken by measuring the area of
tizzue paper needed to cever the outside surface of the lottia
zhell.
Metabolic rates of C. scabra were estimated via the onygen
consumption rates recorded in a differential respirometer. C.
srabma found on Li gigantea with two or more riders were compared
with C. scabra from the surrounding area. Gerial respiration
rates of all the C. zeabma were measured within an hou after
