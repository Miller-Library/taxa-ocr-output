Field oheervations show that the amount of standing algal
growth on the surface of the Li gigantea shell is inversely
preportional to the number of riders present on the shell. Fig.
S shows this observation to be quantifiably true; the presente of
more riders implies the presence of less algae. In tact, with
tue or more riders the ampunt of standing algae per square inch
of La digantea shell is unmeasurably low.
While both the Le gigantea with and without algae (i.e.
without and with riders) increase the thickness of their shell as
they increase its overall sise (see Fig. 4), the presente of
algse (i.e, mome riders) did not cause any signiticant
change in rate of increase in shell thickness for pe ginante.

The average rate of oxygen consumption per dry body weight
of the C. scabra on Le digantes with two or more riders was 77y

surrounding area was 767 ul Oo/g/hr (n - 6), with the difference
