to lomomotion. Wecause C. scabma never leave the shell of the E
digantea, they are likely to never forage over long distances.
C. scabma in the surrounding area, however, can forage over long
distances and becaume of inter- and intra-species competition tor
the local algae, they are more likely to need to forage over lang
distances to get a sufficient food supply. Ereen (1971) shuwed
that Collisella digitalis moved greater distances from its
original site when food availability was low and the same may be
true for Ca scabma. Calow, 1974, and Denny, 1980, have both
indicated that locomotion in gastropods can he a signiticant
metabolic cost. Calow (1974) reports locomotion costs to he as
high as 26 of total food intake and if rider E. scabma dom't
incur this metabolic cost them they can exist on less algae and
still maintain the same respiration mate, which I have shown them
to do.
While rider C. scabma show differences in shell growth,
foraging area, density of population, and pemhaps in di
travelled compared to nonriders of the same species,

the addition of a Cy scabra is the loss of the algal coat that
