oreater in times of rougher surf and more extreme high tides.
Lottia gigantea foraging patterns were similar to those of
the Cy scabra: Ee gigantea were mobile and foraging during the
two hours surrounding high tides. Casual observations again
huted that rougher sumf during the high tides increased the time
spent fomaging, distance travelled, and the percentage st L
aidantsa foraging in an area. In times of peak wave action the
La diganteg were not only mobile, but ewhibited the unusual
behavior previously noted by Morris, et al, 1980, of pulling its
shell away from the rock surface rather than hunkering against
the rock like other limpets. While this behavior has been noted
to he advantageous for the Er gigantea because it allows water to
flow around the La gigantea foot and decreases drag on the limpet
as a whole (Morris, et al, 1980), it also effectively isplates
the C. scabma on its back; the riders find themselves on a shell
lifted uff the rock surface often as high as the P. acabma's own
hody length. While this positioning of the Le gigantea away from
the romk pan he a formidable barrier to a rider attempting to get
off the Ly gigantea shell, it does not appear to be the cause of
the Co acabma failing to leave the shall; the Le gidantea are
only positioned away from the rock in this manner for a trastion
