mussequent scraping of the area beneath the C. scabra in order to
create the homescar, the resulting spot of thinner shell is
unlikely te affect the overall strength of the shell because, as
Falmer (1980) implies, the shell structure as a factor in
strength can outweigh a few local changes in shell thickness.
Also, these spots of decressed shell thickness are usually
covered by the Sa scabma which created the scar and are, thus,
uzually not expmsed long enough for forres to take advantage o
these weak spt.
CONCLUSIONS
1.)
The spacial density of C. scabra is ten times less on L.
digantea than in the surrounding area, possibly due to limited
foraging arsa on the Li gigantea.
2.) In areas of increazed wave action the density of ridems om
the Ly gigantea increases, possibly dus to corresponding increase
in rate of algal growth caused by increased ambient water flow.
3.) Hider Ca sgabra have a higher ratio of shell mass per hody
mase than de nonriders, possibly due to either a.) a slower rate
of body growth necessitating that the shell be laid down thickem,
ar b.) the body mass being limited by the smallem internal volume
available created by the shell being laid down thicker.
