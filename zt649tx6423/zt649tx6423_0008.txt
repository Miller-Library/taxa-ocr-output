Field Ohservations
Lattia gigantea were found only within a i meter Fange of
intertidal heights, approwimately 1.Em to 2.Em above zero tide
datum, and only in areas of high wave action on vertical rock
faces. Collisella scabma inhabited these same areas but were
also found in areas of lower wave action, on horizontal surtaces,
and on sites up to .Em. above zero tide datum. Within the cne
meter range of cohabitation hy these species (which included the
entire La gigantea range), intertidal height made no difference
in whether or not a lottia had riders or in the amount of riders
ner lottia (r - .OS, n - 21). Instead, the number of riders per
La digantea appears dependent on the Ly gidantes's microhabitats
conditions. Casual field observations indicate that it the
didantea is positioned in a crevice, behind a rocky on a rock
face not directly facing the oncoming surf, or in any other
microhabitat reducing its exposure to waves, it has none or fewer
riders than a similar Ey gigantea in areas of higher wave action.
