been shown in several cases that increased ambient water flowÂ¬
increases the rate of algal growth. Such an increase in alde
growth rate could explain how Ca scabra can exist in numbess
greater than twe on a Ei gigantea even if their is no standing
algae on the shell. This hypothesis is further supported by the
fact that there is no decrease in oxygen consumption in riders
that are found on shells with two or more Co seabta. The rate of
Mygen consumption is strongly correlated with metabplic rate
(Parry, 1977) which has been shown to be inversely related to
fGEd availability (Farry, 1978, Eranch 2 Newell, 1978, Davies,
1767). The lack of a decrease in respiration mates of riders on
crowded Ei gigantea shells could indicate that there is
sutticient food available om bi gigantee shells, even on shells
with more than two riders and no apparent standing aldae.
Ihis tood availability hypothesis is further supported by
the tact that mider C. scabra have heavier shells per body weight
than nonriders, which may indimate that they feed slower than the
thinner-shelled nonriders and thus need less algae on which to
feed. Falmer (1980) shewed that thicker shelled Thaid lamellosa
fmed slower than thinner shelled ones, and this may also be true
of L srabma. Palmer's study of In lamellosa also showed a
slower rate of increase in bedy weight propertional to shell
weight in thicker-shelled animals (1780), which is similar to the
P
Lahe
propertional to body size than the thinner-shelled nonmiders.
Palmer explains this by showing that the amount of shell material
laid dowm over time is the same tor both the thick- and the thim-
