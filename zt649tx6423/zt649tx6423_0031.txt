ACKNDWLEDGEMENTS
Ibis projemt would never have beem completed without the
anvice and encouragement of my advisor, Hark Demny. Had it nat
Laen for his ability to make the dreamy and often hazardous
intertidal work seem "neat", I would have given up on this
prejest leng ago. I would alze like to thank the rest of the
faculty and staff at Hepkins Mamine Station fom imparting on me many
of the ideas and technical knowledge I used in my work. Finally.
I would like to thank my fellow students, especially those
pesiding at 100 Forest Ave.. fom listening to all the thials and
tribulations of working with C.
kaalaaaiaaataat-
in which I'm sure they held no previous interest.
