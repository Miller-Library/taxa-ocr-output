lower for riders than nonriders, or 4.) The density of C. scabma
is determined by the food availability and the surface of the
smooth En gigantea shell provide only a limited area for algal
growth while the surrounding rock'e surface is relatively
etremely rough, providing a greatem surface area fom algal
grouth, and cam therefore support an increased amount of foraging
Laaa-
Neither possibility l or  seems likely to be the
explanation for low rider density because they rely on foraging
and homesite selectiveness of the the Ly scabra, a sturdy speties
nut known te show much selemtiveness as they exist in a wide
varisty of lecations under a wide variety of conditions. But
these possibilities are difficult to disprove because it wmuld
entail watching the Ea scabra as they mount L. gigantea shells,
an umpredictable event at best and ome that would be difficult to
see in significant numbers. Fossibility  would entail a
fecundity study af C. scabra which in the past have proved
difficult and inconclusive in determining fastors for
survivability (Farry, 1977, Wells, 1980). However, casual
obzaryations pyer a seven week perind did not note a greatem
disaaid
which would probably he noticeable if it were large enough to
euplain the ten-fold difference in demsities.
