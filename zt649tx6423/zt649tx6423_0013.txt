DISCUSSION
The subpopulation of E. scabra that lies within the one
meter range of Li gigantea distribution is larger at lower
intertidal sites than at higher sites (se Fig ib). This trend
is opposite to that previously notes by Morris, et al, (1780) in
which the general population of L are larger at higher
intertidal sites. This reversal in Ca srabma size distribution
within this one meter range can probably be explained by the
presence and site distribution of Le gigantea in the same mange
(see Fig. 1a). The Le gigantea bulldoze much of the area, which
creatly affetts the distribution and population of C EA in
the area. If a particulam C. scabra is able to resist the
bulldozing force of a Le gigantea, it is more likely to be found
in this range than if it were not able to resist dislodgement.
W. G. Wright (1777) showed that homing species, including
scabma, can sometimes resist forces in cese of the Le
didantea's bulldozing force but only if the force is applied when
the Cy scabma is on its homesite. Limpets without homesites
could not resist the bulldozing at all. Assuming, then, that I.)
