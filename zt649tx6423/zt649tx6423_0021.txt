Farrow, 1985), J.) It could effect the drag coefficient of the
limmet as a whole, 4.) The weight of the riders can increase the
metabolic needs of the Le gigantea because of the increased load
it muet carry in locomotion, or S.) The creation of a homescar by
the rider Co scabma could significantly weaken the Li gigantea
shell.
In actuality, none of these hypathetical effects cause a
significant difference between Ei didantea with and without
riders. First, the Ly gigantea show no difference in the ratio
of shell weight to sufame area (see fig. 6) between shells with
and without riders. If borings, either caused by algae om a
spunge, were significantly affecting the shells, a ditterence
umuld have occurred in these ratios (Young amp; Nelsen, 1985).
While the existence of riders did appear to be associated with an
increase in the occurrence of the boring sponge gliona gelata on
the My didantea shell, the microscopic bored holes were too small
te make any substantial differente tu the Li gidantea. Likewise,
the increass in drag coefficient due ta the algal coat on .
digantea with no riders has beem shownn to be insigniticantly
small and the loss of algae is likely to be countered by an
aaatt
drag amefficient independent of the nummem of .tes nit
shell. In addition, the weight of the midens is unlikely to
ingrmaze the metabolic needm of lomemotion as the proportionally
