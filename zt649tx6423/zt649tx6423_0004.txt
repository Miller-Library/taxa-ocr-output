If it is again assumed that the shape of the limpet does not
change as it grows (a reasonable assumption for these species),
an estimate of relative limpet volumes is obtained by (pedal

The Da scabma density on the Li gigantea shells were
calculated as (the  of scabra riders on the bi gigantee
shell)/(shell surfate area). (Note: Li gigantea pedal area was
used as am estimation af shell suuface amea as noted above.)
Spasial density of the Sa scabma in the area surrounding a lottia
was malculated in two ways. First, as a measure of the sheem
numbers af Dy sgabma in the area, I counted the number of scabra
within a SOcm. X SO em. quadrat centered on each Ee didantea. Ca
srabra demsity equalled (the  of C. scabma in the
transect)/(2500 em"). Second, as a measure of the numbers of C.
scabna per area available for foraging, Cr scabma density
equalled (the  of C. scabra in the transect)/ (2500 emt - the
zum af all areas within the transect bulldozed by by ginantea).
The bulldezed grazing areas were measured using a grid divided
into areas of 4 emt and counting the number of these divisions
covered by the graing armas.
