ABSTRACT
The subpopulation of Collisella scabra found on the
shells of Lottia gigantea show significant differences from the
general population of C scabra: population density is ten times
less, shell/hody weight ratios are higher indicating slower
orputh patterns possibly due to limited food availability, and
denmity on the shell increases in areas of high wave astion
possibly due to the faster rate of algal growth in these areas.
Ihe limited foraging area on the Le gigantea shell may provide an
upper limit to the number of riders it can support, as riders
from crowded shells do not lower their metabolic rates. HE
p tdtheea
coat otherwise found on their shells. This loss of algae, the
creation of the Cy scabra's home scar, the added weight of the
riders, or the drag differences created by the riders cause no
amparent advantage or disadvantage to the Li gigantea. While
these remults are in ho way comprehensive, they provide a
backorpund knowledge for further studies of the species
interactions.
