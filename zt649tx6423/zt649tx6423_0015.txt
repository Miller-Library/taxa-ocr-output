Froximity to Li gigantea may explain why the density of C.
scabma per area of Li gigantea shell is independent of density in
the measured surrounding area. Os only some  can resist
bulldozing (Wright, 1977), the density of C. scabra immediately
surrounding the Li gigantea is a reflection of the number of D.
spahma that could resist bulldozing. This number is not
necessarily a function of the total number of C. acabma in the
larger surrmunding area and is also conziderably less the G
scabra density in this larger area. If further experiments show
that approkimately one in ten Ci scabra could resist bulldoring
and thus that the density of Ca scabra was on average 10 times
less in the bulldored area than in the surrounding area, it could
EMplain why density per area of Li gigantea shell is on average
ten times less than in the larger surrounding area. Hider
density would then simply be a function of of C. scabra density
in the immediate surrounding graring area rather than in the
langem ungrated surrounding area.
The fact that there are ten times fewer . scabma per area of
L. digantea shell than per surrounding area could be explained sy
numeroum uther factors. Ferhaps the low density per area of
shell is because: 1.) It is ten times more likely for a Q.
scabma to forage on a rock than on a mobile shell (This is
assuming Ca scabma are still able to forage onto a moving shell
a

.
2.) Unly one in ten Ee didante encountered by meving L scabme
are stationemy (assuming C. smabne selectively clims only en
Immobile shells), .) Survivability is on average ten time
