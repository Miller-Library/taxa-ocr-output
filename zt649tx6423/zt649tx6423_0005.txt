beginning at the point of the lowest lottia. I computed and
averaged the pedal areas of all Ly gigantea within each transect
(4-7 luttia weme in each transect).
I used the same method for measuring a scabma sise as a
function of intertidal height except that I did not measure all
the C. smabma at site H2. Instead, a 2Scm.-wide vertical strip
was haphazardly chmsen at the site. Within the strip, I measured
the lengths and widths of all the C. scabra at the same o
herizontal transects marked off from the lottia measurements (4-9
scabra were in each transet).
Laboratory Studies
I measured the amount of standing algal growth on eight
digantea shells and also noted the number of riders on each of
these shells. On one shell was a fresh scar that appeared to be
the homesite of a C. sgabra which was no longer on the shell.
The sear appeared to be i-E dayz old as it lacked any algae om
evidence of amosion and was still the lucid grey color of curgent
C. scabma homesites. For the purpose of this measurement, I
counted this scar as 1/2 of a rider because the missing ridem had
recently beem present to eat some of the algae even if it hadm't
mpased on the shell in the preyios
days.
As an estimate of shell suface area of Le gigantea in the
laboratory studies, I measured the area of tissus paper needed to
toyer the sumface of the shell. To measume the amount of algal
arguth on theee same shells, I scraped the surface of the shell
and dissolyed my scrapings in 70 acetone. A spectrophutometen
