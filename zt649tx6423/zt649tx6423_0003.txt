All field observations and samples of kottia gigantea and
Collisella scabra were conducted at Hopkins Marine Station,
Facific Groye, CO. Sites 41 and 2 were on two sheer rack taces
at Cabrillo Foint, directly facing the oncoming surf and site e
nas a wall near Bird Hock at an angle of approximately 45 degrees
to the ancoming sumf. I chose these sites because of their
abundance of Lottia gigantea at the widest range of intertidal
Heights to e fund at the Station.
I observed the Li gigantea and Ce scabra during 30 daytime
low tides and three high tides: 1.)a high high tide at 2100 a.m.
2y) a low high tide at 6100 a.m. (1/T heur after dawn) and d.)a
hich high tide at 4:00 p.m. The high tide watches were done at
sites i a T fom six hours, beginning three hours before high
tidm.

The pedal area of the limpets was then estimated to be mi

mesaumed in the field. However, within sach species the shapes
af the shells, including the height of the apes, remains constant
as a funntien of length and width. Therefore, surface area of
the shells depende primarily on the length and width of the shell
and the equation for pedal area was thus used as an estimation of
ralative sumface amea of the shelle within each species.
