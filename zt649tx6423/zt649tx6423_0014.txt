digantea and would be unlikely to be able to resist dislodgement
because, first, its small sise would be unable to exert a large
enough force, and, second, if its small size were due to a young
age, then it would not have had much time tw establish a
significant home scar.
he tact that Ce scabra can resist dislodgement by L.
gigantea may also be a factor in detemmining why it is the only
species of limpets found on the backs of bi gigantea. Due to its
homing behavior, it is one of the few species that cam resist
bulldoring and exist within an area otherwise completely cleamed
of limpets. Because this bulldozed area normally surrounds the
E digantea, the Ca scabra may be the only species of limpete
clase enough to scramble up on the Li gigantea's shell. In fact,
Wright (1977) has shown that not only are Collissella digitalis
unable to avercome the bulldozing force, but they alse tend to
recognire and actively avoid Li gigantea grazing areas, which
might explain why this species, which is similam in size,
distribution, and grazing behaviors to C. scabra, is not found om
L gidantea shells. The rigidity of Ca smabra's homing behavior
(Jessee, 1968, Villee a Groody, 1740, Hewatt, 1740) may also
explain its seemingly unique ability to live on the comfined amea
