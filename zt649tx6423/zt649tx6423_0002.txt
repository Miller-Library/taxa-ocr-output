Introdution
In this study I examine the interactions between Collisella
seabra and Lottia gigantea in particular the association between
the subpopulation of Co scabra which live on the surface of the
Le digantea shell (henceforth referred to as riders). What are
the differences between this subpepulation and the genemal E
scabra population (henceforth referred to as nonmiders) and,
setund, what are the differences between Li gigantea with and
without these C. scabma riders on their shells?
Ihe existente of riders on limpets shells is not an entirely
pew phenomenon. A surprising number of limpets live on the
shells of other animals. Species of acmaeids and patellids live
on the shell of conspecifics until they become too large, at
which time they migrate onte the surrounding rock (Branch, 1971).
Other spei suha Eatellidainiis and C
are found to home on a series of other shells, changing host
shells rapidly (Eikenberry & Wickizer, 1944, Creese, 1778).
However, Om scabra are unique in that they ride on the back of a
species othem than their own and in greater density and numbers
than ather miders.
In this study of the interactions between riders and the L
disiamtes on which they are found, I maks preliminary field
ubsemvations and measurements of shell and body welghte and
sizes, C. scabra densities and metabolic mates, and tood
availability on the Ey digantea shell surface. While the results
