deviations from this correlation are caused by the amount of
riders being too small for a given sired Le gigantea and never in
too large an amount of riders ewisting on the shell (Assuming the
lipe in Fig. 4 to be specifying the limit of riders a Le gidantea
shell can support). It appears, then, that the available
foraging area of a Ly gigantea shell sets an upper limit to the
total eum of riders' sizes whith can home and forage on the
shell, but that it does not determine the amount of ridere Below
that limit. If this is true, then only about half of the Le
didantea are near the limit of the amount of riders its available
foraging areas can support (see tig. 4).
Howeyer, the shell's available foraging area is not
uecessarily an indication of the available algse. The amount of
avsilable algae is dependent on several factors, largely the rate
of arputh of the algae. While the spectrophotometer data showed
that the amount of standing growth of algae decreased with an
increase in number of riders and that the amount of standing
areuth was approaching zero on Le gidantea with two or more
riderm (sse fig. E), it does not indicate the rate of growth of
the algae on the shells. If the rate of algae growth on the Le
siaantea with two or more riders is faster than the rate on the
shells with fewer riders, then the C. scabra from the more
trowded shells would have just as much algae available to them.
