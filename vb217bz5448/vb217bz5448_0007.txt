that the anemones tended to leave the rocks at a rate dependen
on 1) wave action and 2) amount of exposure to sewage-lader
The influence of these two factors is especially
water
shown by the rocks placed at stations 2 and 6. Both of
these areas are subjected to heavy wave action. Anemones
on the rocks placed immediately behind the outfall became
etached within four days, whereas those at the wave-action
control (station 6) stayed for a much longer period, almost
half of them migrating to the protected side of the rock
before becoming detached. The other rocks were placed
idepool areas less affected by wave action and it was
ound that in every case the anemones in pools with higk
hosphate and chlorine concentrations left more quickly than
those in pools with normal seawater concentrations,
o better judge the variables involved in the detachment
anemones, laboratory experiments to test toxicity were
run with va rious dilutions of both Pacific Grove and Fontere
orimary treated effluent. One very noticeable difference
petween the two sources of sewage is that the sewage from
Wonterey was unchlorinated. The results of these experiment

a much morr rapid effect at all concentrations than
had
le Monterey sewage did. For instance, the LTgo in 1004
ewage was 14 days in Pacific Grove effluent while anemones
in Wonterey effluent at a similar concentration showe
an LT50 of 6 days
At this point it would be easy to conclude that chlorine
