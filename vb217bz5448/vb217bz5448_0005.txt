Figurei illustrates the relationship of Foint Pinos
Monterey Bay and shows the exact location of the stud,
area at Point Pinos. The study area itself lies about
300 feet from the base of Point Pinos and is about 100
feet by 50 feet. For convenience it has been divided
into four subareas, as shown in figure i
igure2 demonstrates the relationship of current
atterns to salinity and concentrations of phosphates
and chlorine at five stations in the study area. Station

mexpectedly levels here are similar to those expected
or normal seawater. Stations 2,3, and 4 are inshore
om the outfall in rocky areas where currents tend to
weep the effluent at both high and low tides. Here levels
f chlorine and phosphorus are greater. Note that there is
gradient from station 2 (highest concentrations of effluent
through station 4 to station 3. Station 5 is swept by
olluted water only during the rising tide and has therefore
orrespondingly lower values. This area for the most par-

the study area into four sections shown in figures 1 and 4.
