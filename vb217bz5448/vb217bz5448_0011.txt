Anthopleura elegantissima is distributed around the
putfall according to a gradient which parallels gradients
physical and chemical properties related to the presence
fsewage effluent.
Anemones placed in the field become detached from their
ubstrates more frequently as they approach the outfall.
LTso's of animals placed in Monterey sewage were longer
than those tested in unchlorinated Pacific Grove effluent
hese in turn were longer still than those tested in
orinated Pacific Grove sewage
Concentrations of sewage necessary to produce toxicit
n the laboratory were far greater than the effective
concentrations of sewage experienced by the anemones
the field
Observations of the reactions of anemones to concentra
observations suggested that fie
sewage and to field
pulations were being directly affected by the primar
ffluent.
All of the evidence from this study suggests that sewage
responsible for the peculiar distribution of anemones
the study area around the outfall
