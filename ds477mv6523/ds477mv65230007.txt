digitalis after a certain length of exposure to the results of the heat-budget model,
determined how near the limpets live to their thermal limits, and how often that
limit is exceeded.
A heat-budget model takes into consideration physical aspects of both
the environment and the organism to determine predicted body temperature.
The basis of the model is an energy-conservation equation that relates the
various ways in which an organism transfers heat to and from the environment
(Gates 1980, Campbell and Norman 1998):
Wsun + WIRskyt WIR,sur+ Weonv + Weond - Wevap + Wmet - Wstored (eg. 1)
where Wsun is energy absorbed from the sun, Win.sky and Wig,surare net infrared
energy transferred between the organism and its surroundings, Weany is energy
gained or lost to convection by wind, Weong is energy gained or lost to conduction
with the rock, Wevap is energy lost to evaporation, Wmet is energy from the limpet's
metabolism, and Wstoreg is stored energy. The essence of this formula is that
energy in minus energy out remains as stored energy.
For a limpet, the stored energy is negligible due the small thermal mass of
the animal, so l assumed that Wstoregis zero. The energy of metabolism is also
approximately zero because limpets are ectotherms with low metabolic rates.
Energy lost to evaporation is effectively zero as L. digitalis lose little water from
underneath their shells (Wolcott 1973). We thus have a simplified equation:
Wsun + WIR,Sky+ WIR,sur+ Weonv + Weond -0
(eq. 2)
