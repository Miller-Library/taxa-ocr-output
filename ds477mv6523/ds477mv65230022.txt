Fig. 1. Comparison of the survivorship of L. digitalis after 10 minutes and 3
hours, 40 minutes exposure.
Fig. 2. Comparison of the graphs of log Nu vs. log Re for the 3 model
orientations. Slopes of linear regressions for each orientation are not
statistically distinguishable (p=0.055).
Fig. 3. Comparison of the spans of time L. digitalis at 1.5 above MLLW and 2 m
above MLLW spend above 30°0.
Fig. 4. Comparison of the frequency of L. digitalis 1.5 m above MLLW and 2 m
above MLLW experiencing a thermal event above 30°C for given lengths
of time. Error bars represent one standard deviation.
