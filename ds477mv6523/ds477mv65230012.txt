(essentially, Fick's second equation of diffusion applied to the conduction of heat,
Incropera and DeWitt 2002).
Construction of heat-budget model. Combining these various heating and
cooling factors via equation (2), one can solve for the predicted body temperature
at any time, given the instantaneous environmental conditions and the nature of
the limpet. A computer program can then model the body temperature over
many years based on seasonal, daily, and tidal variation. I entered the data from
the Nusselt and Reynolds results (anterior-facing-wind data only), absorptivity,
representative limpet size, and the constants listed in Table 2 into a generic
limpet heat-budget model devised by M. Denny, which assumes that the limpet is
on a planar surface of known inclination and azimuth.
This program outputs one body temperature for every 10 minutes, as well
as a list of when and for how long the model limpet body temperature exceeded
30°C, and what the maximum temperature was in each stressful period.
modeled the body temperature for 36 years of hypothetical weather, for limpets
1.5 and 2 m above mean lower low water (MLLW) on a vertical rock surface
facing west. Comparing my thermal tolerances to the heat-budget model
provides a prediction of how near L. digitalis lives to its temperature limits.

Thermal limits. In the ten-minute survivorship trials, all Lottia digitalis tested at
41°C or lower had resumed responding 24 hours later. All those tested at 45°0
and above did not survive. In between those two temperatures, limpets showed
