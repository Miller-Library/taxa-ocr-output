Determination of absorptivity. The first part of the heat-budget model is the
energy the limpet receives directly from the sun:
Wsun - 1 Ap
(eq. 3)
where lis the irradiance of the sun, a is the absorptivity of the limpet (measured
as a fraction of light absorbed), and Ap is the projected area of the shell, or the
area which receives sunlight.
Tis measured with a pyranometer, and it is part of the historical data on
which the model is based. To find a, 1 used a Licor 1800 spectroradiometer
equipped with an integrating sphere to measure the absorptivity of L. digitalis
shells. The radiometer records the intensity of light reflected by the shell, as
compared to a white standard, at wavelengths from 360 nm to 1100 nm. Dividing
the shell results by the standard gives the proportion of light reflected.
multiplied the fraction of light absorbed (1 - fraction reflected) by the fraction of
overall solar radiation emitted at each wavelength. I then added the individual
absorptivities over the whole spectrum to obtain a weighted-average absorptivity
of the limpet shell. Trepeated the procedure with a second shell and averaged
the results.
Determination of long-wave radiation received: Net long-wave radiative
transfer between the limpet and the sky and surroundings was calculated from
the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, which quantifies the energy radiated by an
object:
Radiated Watts = ApeaT
(eq. 4)
