cm higher. At this height, no thermal events lasting longer than 2.5 hours were
encountered in the 36-year period of the test.
Discussion
According to the heat-budget model, Lottia digitalis are predicted not to
reach their lethal temperature in 36 years. For a 10-minute exposure period, the
limpets begin to die at 42°C. The model shows them reaching a maximum of
37°C only three times during the 36-year span, so it appears that L. digitalis
approaches within 5°C of its thermal tolerance about once every 12 years, but it
probably does not get closer than that. Thus, these limpets live much further
away from their lethal limit than the porcelain crabs and turban snails of the low
intertidal, which have maximum habitat temperatures sometimes to within a
degree of their tolerance capacity (Stillman 2002).
The fact that L. digitalis apparently lives far from its thermal limit may
mean that they could tolerate a small increase in air temperature due to global
warming better than other intertidal invertebrates. However, while Tegula and
Petrolisthes may move to shelter themselves from the heat, L. digitalis are
essentially sessile at low tide, making them more vulnerable to climate change.
Though the frequency of mortality events predicted by this model is
immeasurably low, a rise in air temperature, possibly accompanied by changes in
wind and wave patterns, still has the potential to push exposed high intertidal
animals such as L. digitalis over the edge, or at least force them to abandon their
status as a limpet of the high intertidal zone.
