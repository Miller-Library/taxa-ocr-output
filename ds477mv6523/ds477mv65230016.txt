This model recorded thermal events above 30°C and found the maximum
temperature in each event, but it did not give the amount of time spent at that
maximum. In contrast, to understand the importance of the three-hour-forty¬
minute trials, I must determine the highest temperature above which the limpet
spends three hours and forty minutes. This will entail running the modeling
program to search for thermal events above a higher threshold temperature.
Öther extensions of this study should examine the differences in both heat
tolerance and predicted body temperature for L. digitalis of different sizes and
living at different heights on the shore. Size was controlled for in this experiment
by selecting only limpets of intermediate size, and the heat-budget model was
run only for a limpet of length 19 mm. It is clear from Figs. 3 and 4 that a small
difference in intertidal height has a dramatic influence on the probability of
encountering a high-temperature event. The heat-budget modelling program
could be run with other input parameters, including larger size and greater
elevation.
Modelling temperatures for L. digitalis on rocks facing south would also
probably result in higher predicted body temperatures. That L. digitalis seem to
avoid south-facing rocks may indeed be a behavioral adaptation to avoid
unnecessary thermal exposure. It would be revealing to determine how much of
an effect rock orientation has on limpet body temperature. It will also be crucial
to test the heat-budget models by taking field measurements of limpet
temperatures to determine the accuracy of its predictions. Additionally,
throughout this project l attempted to compare my assessment of the significance
