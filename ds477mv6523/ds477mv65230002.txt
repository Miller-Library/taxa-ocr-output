Abstract
Öf all organisms on Earth, invertebrates of the rocky intertidal zones
experience some of the most extreme and varied environments, from near
freezing seawater to hot, dry sunlight. Thus, these organisms experience an
unusually large range of potentially lethal body temperatures. Lottia digitalis, a
high intertidal limpet of the Pacific North American coast, is one such creature.
What is the thermal tolerance of Lottia digitalis, and how often do they see these
body temperatures?
The lethal temperature limits of L. digitalis were found, in air, to vary
depending on length of exposure. At ten minutes of heat exposure, limpet
survivorship (tested 24 hours after exposure) declined from 100% to 0% as
temperature increased from 41 to 45° Celsius. At three hours and forty minutes
of exposure, a similarly steep decline was noted, but at a lower range of
temperatures: from 37 to 40°C.
A heat-budget model was constructed to find how near L. digitalis live to
their thermal maxima, and how often these maxima are exceeded. A heat
budget is a mathematical model that predicts the body temperature of an
organism, based on records of past environmental conditions plus physical
characteristics of the organism. A comparison between the heat extremes
predicted by the heat-budget model and the thermal limits showed that L. digitalis
approaches within 5°C of its thermal limit once every 12 years (on average). L.
digitalis do not live as close to their thermal limit as other intertidal organisms, but
their preference for living on exposed rock surfaces may make them susceptible
to an increase in climatic air temperature.
