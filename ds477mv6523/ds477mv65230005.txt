Determination of thermal tolerance limits. The temperature tolerance of L.
digitalis was measured in air, where they would normally see their maximum
temperatures. Two periods of exposure were used. Previous modeling efforts
predict that the most common period for limpet body temperatures to exceed
30°C is ten minutes (Denny, personal communication). Thus ten minutes was
selected as the shorter exposure time. In general, the probability of encountering
a 30°C thermal event decreases as the period of the event increases. However
there is a peak in probability of encounter for high-body-temperature events
lasting three hours and forty minutes. Though we do not know the physiological
significance of this length of time, it was used as the longer exposure time.
Lottia digitalis were collected from the rocks at Hopkins Marine Station ir
Pacific Grove, CA. I collected limpets from the uppermost parts of their range,
early in the morning while the rocks were still wet and the limpets had not yet
clamped themselves to the rock. If they were firmly attached, I sprayed them
several times with cold seawater to induce them to loosen their grip. Then 1 pried
them off with a sharpened screwdriver, using care not to cut their feet. collected
only limpets between 16 and 22 mm in length, which is a typical size for an adult
L. digitalis. Prior to testing, the limpets were held for less than 6 hours in a finger
bowl with circulating water of 15 to 16°0.
For each test, 15 limpets were placed in a glass beaker of air and allowed
to attach themselves to the walls of the container. The beaker was then covered
with plastic wrap and submerged in a constant-temperature water bath. The
