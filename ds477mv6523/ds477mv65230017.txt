of L. digitalis thermal limits to those found in other intertidal species, which may
be an unfair comparison. What would be more illuminating would be to compare
limits and heat-budget models of other limpet species from around the intertidal
zone. It would undoubtedly be exciting to find trends relating species habitat and
how near they live to their thermal limits.
Conclusions
The thermal tolerance limit of Lottia digitalis after 10 minutes of exposure
in air lies between 42 and 45°C; after 3 hours and 40 minutes, between 38 and
40°0. A heat-budget model predicting hypothetical body temperatures over a 36-
year span showed that limpets may only reach 37°C about once per decade.
Thus, L. digitalis apparently live more comfortably distant from their thermal limits
than invertebrates of the low intertidal zone. However, because L. digitalis live in
the high intertidal on exposed rock faces, they may be susceptible to the
increases in air temperature forecasted to accompany global climate change.
Acknowledgements
would especially like to thank my advisor Professor Mark Denny, my
graduate student advisor Luke Miller, and Dr. Jim Watanabe. Thank you also to
the rest of the Denny and Somero labs for the use of their time, equipment, and
space. A final thank you goes to the rest of the faculty, staff, and students of the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, without whom this project would
have not been possible.
