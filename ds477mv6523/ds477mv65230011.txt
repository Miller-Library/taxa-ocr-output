where mis the mass of the model and Og is the specific heat of the silver alloy,
With Weon in hand we can calculate hefor a model at one wind speed and
orientation. The Reynolds and Nusselt numbers are defined as:
Re = Le/v
(eq. 10)
Nu = he Le/Kair
(eq. 11)
Here vis the wind speed in mis, Lais the length of the model in m, Kaj is the
thermal conductivity of air in WimK, and vis the kinematic viscosity of air in m2/s.
Nusselt and Reynolds numbers are related by a general model:
Nu = 10° Reb
(eq. 12)
The values a and b can be found by graphing logio(Nu) vs. logjo(Re), yielding a
line with slope b and y-intercept a:
logio(Nu) = a + blogio(Re)
(eq. 13)
Taveraged the Reynolds and Nusselt numbers for the three replicated
trials of the 4 models, each at 6 speeds and 3 orientations. I plotted logjo(Nu) vs.
logio(Re) and the slopes of the resulting regressions allowed me to calculate ha,
and thereby Nu. The values 10“ and b were later incorporated into the heat¬
budget modeling program.
Determination of energy of conduction with the rock: The energy transferred
by conduction was calculated using Fourier's Law:
Weond - -Krock Abase dTIdy
(eq. 14)
where Krock is the thermal conductivity of the rock, Apase is the area of the base of
the limpet, and dT/dy is the gradient of temperature in the rock. In the model
used here, dT/dy is calculated by numerically solving the heat equation
