beaker contained several drops of seawater to prevent desiccation. The water
bath was fully warmed up to the experimental temperature prior to immersion of
the beaker. Äfter waiting for the time allotted (either 10 minutes or 3 hours 40
minutes), I removed the beaker and immediately transferred the limpets back to a
15 to 16°C bath of circulating seawater, immersing them fully.
tested for responsiveness of the limpets immediately after testing, and
then 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours
later. Responsiveness was defined as some movement of the foot, head, or
mantle when poked with a fingernail. I determined that the best way to elicit
movement was by poking the mantle, which they then retracted. I assumed that
if the limpets were not responding by 24 hours after testing, they were dead.
Each group of 15 limpets was used only once and then returned to the rocks.
Experimental temperature was increased until all limpets died. Both the
temperature at which limpets begin to die and the temperature at which they all
die are important measurements of the lethal temperature.
Introduction to heat-budget model theory. The second part of the experiment
was the construction of a heat-budget model that used four years of
environmental records (wind speed, solar irradiation, tidal height, wave height, air
temperature, sea-surface temperature) to predict the internal temperature of a
limpet over a span of many years. The model calculated an ensemble of
random, hypothetical conditions to which limpets would be exposed. With these
data, one can locate when, and for how long, an organism is likely to see a
particular threshold temperature. By comparing the lethal temperatures of L.
