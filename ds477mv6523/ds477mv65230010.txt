Each model was heated to above 60°C with a hair dryer and/or soldering
iron and allowed to cool to 30°C in wind of a known velocity. The models have
small holes in the bottom, into which were inserted thermocouple leads and
Wakefield Thermal Compound. These leads were connected to a Campbell
Scientific CR23X Micrologger, which recorded the model temperature, air
temperature inside the wind tunnel, wind speed, and time every five seconds.
The models rested on a 22 cm square by 2 cm tall Styrofoam (a nonconductive
substratum) tile, on the windward side of which were arranged 7 rows of 4 plaster
tiles whose surfaces were cast from a real granite rock. Each tile had exactly the
same shape to promote constant air movement, and was 11 cm square by 2 cm
tall. The silver models were placed on the forward edge of the Styrofoam
nearest the tiles.
Each limpet was tested in three orientations: anterior facing the wind,
sidewise, and posterior facing the wind. For each orientation, three trials were
conducted at each of the following approximate wind speeds: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3.5,
and 5.5 m/s. Using the temperature-decay and wind-speed data, I calculated the
Nusselt and Reynolds numbers for each limpet model at each wind speed and
orientation. These two numbers provide a way to calculate the heat transfer
coefficient of a limpet of any size. Earlier it was noted that
Weonv - he (Tair- Timpet) Acony
(eq. 8)
Weon and he are both unknown, but we can calculate Weony using the physical
properties of the silver alloy models:
Weonv - ATimpet m Os /t
