open rock faces to crevices or algae, relates to the maximum body temperature it
reaches, and that is the impetus for this study.
Previous experiments have been undertaken to determine the tolerance of
L. digitalis to thermal stress. Wolcott (1973) found that L. digitalis were unable to
locomote normally 24 hours after immersion in seawater for fifteen minutes at 38
to 40°C. Hardin (1968) studied L. digitalis mortality after exposure in air for 5, 10,
and 15 hours. He found that almost all survived the tests at 29°C, all died at
34°C, and there was intermediate mortality at 31.5°C. These experimenters
recorded a sampling of air and limpet body temperatures over short periods, but
none attempted to systematically relate their measurements of thermal
tolerances to the periods of time the limpets reached extreme body
temperatures.
Underständing the thermal tolerances of marine organisms potentially
enables us to predict their responses to impending climate change. The
porcelain crabs that live continuously near their limits may be greatly affected by
a climatic increase in air temperature. However, if the ocean does not warm in
concert with the air, porcelain crabs may simply retreat lower on the shore rather
than die. Global warming may have more impact on L. digitalis and other
organisms that spend most of their time in air. Will an increase of a few degrees
push their body temperature over their tolerance threshold??
