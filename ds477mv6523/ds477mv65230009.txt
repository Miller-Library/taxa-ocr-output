Here T is the absolute temperature of the object, Ap is the radiative area of the
object, ais infrared emissivity, and gis the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Because
the rock and limpet are at about the same temperature, there is little net IR
transfer between the two, and that factor was ignored. Most of the IR transfer is
between the limpet and the sky. The net long-wave radiation energy is then:
Wnet = Win - Wout - Vsky AL Esky G Tair - Vsky AL Simpet G Timpet
(eq. 5)
where Vgyy is the fraction of a limpet's lateral area exposed to the sky. The goal
of this equation is to calculate Timpet so we use a Taylor series to reduce eq. 5 to
an approximate expression containing Timpet:
Wnet  Vsky AL Slimpet G Tai(Esky - 1) + 4 Vsky a AL impet GTair (Esky Tair-Timpet) (eq. 6)
Determination of heat transfer coefficient. Energy exchange by convection
was calculated using Newton's Law of Cooling:
Weonv - he (Tair- Timpet) Aconv
(eq. 7)
where h, is the heat transfer coefficient and Acony is the surface area of the limpet
exposed to wind. he is a measure of the heat exhanged as a function of limpet
size, shape, and wind speed, and is expressed in units of Wim2/AT. I measured
he empirically using a low-speed wind tunnel (described in Bell 1995) to find the
rate at which limpets lose heat to the air due to forced convection. Four limpet
models were used in this experiment, described in Table 1. The models are
silver alloy casts of actual L. digitalis. Silver was used because it conducts heat
very well. As a result it maintains a constant temperature throughout its mass,
simplifying the measurement of body temperature.
