Introduction
Organisms of the rocky intertidal zone of Monterey Bay experience a wide
variety of environments from frigid water when the tide is in to full sun exposure
on hot days when the tide recedes. Lottia digitalis is a limpet that lives in the
high intertidal zone, from one to three meters above mean lower low water
(Shotwell 1950). L. digitalis prefer vertical rock faces, particularly those facing
west, and tend to live in clusters. Due to its elevation on the rock, this species
sees some of the most extreme terrestrial conditions of any local limpet, as only
L. scabra lives higher in some locations. Absorption of solar energy causes
rocks (and their attached limpets) to warm more than air or water, and L. digitalis
are sessile when the tide is out, so they do not escape to water if the rock
temperature rises (McMahon 1990). While on these emersed rock surfaces,
limpets experience desiccation, osmotic stress, heat stress, and sometimes
death (Williams and Morritt 1995).
Many intertidal species, including Tegula turban snails and Petrolisthes
porcelain crabs, deal with temperature extremes by remaining low on the rocks
near water and hiding in sheltered crevices and underneath algae. It has long
been conjectured that thermal tolerance correlates with vertical position, meaning
organisms that live higher in the intertidal zone (and are therefore exposed to
longer and warmer periods of heat) have higher thermal tolerance. It has been
found that Petrolisthes' maximum habitat temperature is in fact within a few
degrees of its lethal temperature (Stillman 2002). It is not known how the thermal
maximum of a high intertidal organism such as L. digitalis, which prefers high
