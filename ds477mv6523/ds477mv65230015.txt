These conclusions must be tempered by several caveats. First, the
temperature tolerance tests probably overestimated the true thermal limit,
because certain aspects of the experiments may not fully represent nature. It is
likely that desiccation, for instance, would lower the thermal limit somewhat,
though Wolcott (1973) showed that limpets in the field lose little water. In my
experiment l focused on the effects of heat and eliminated the desiccation factor
by keeping the limpets moist.
Although my conclusions differ from those of earlier experiments on crabs
and turban snails, the inclusion of factors such as desiccation and osmotic stress
may put L. digitalis thermal limits more in line with previously-studied intertidal
organisms. Future experiments might address this question by including
desiccation as a factor in heat tolerance. One useful experiment would be to
measure L. digitalis thermal limits while adjusting both temperature and humidity
level.
Additionally, there are a few inaccuracies in the heat-budget model that
could be improved to get a more realistic picture of the hardiness of L. digitalis.
The model is a simplification of the intertidal zone. It assumes, for example, that
the limpet is shaped like a cone, but a L. digitalis shell has prominent ridges that
may curb or intensify the effects of certain environmental factors. Limpets will
lose some energy via evaporative cooling, but that factor was left out of the
model.
It is difficult to compare the results of the thermal tolerance test for three
hours and forty minutes of exposure to the output from the heat-budget model.
