a decreasing survival rate with increasing temperature (Fig. 1). For the 220¬
minute trials, limpet mortality began at 38°C, and there was no survival at or
above 40°C, a range which is about 4°C lower than the equivalent range for the
shorter exposure time (Fig. 1).
Heat-budget model. The absorptivities of the two limpet shells were 0.644 and
0.630, which averages to 0.637. Thus, 63.7% of the light these limpets receive is
absorbed. Figure 2 compares the graphs of log Nu vs. log Re for the three
orientations of the limpet models, and the data from the graph is summarized in
Table 3. The values of a and b, and thus the rate of convective cooling, differ
only slightly depending on the orientation of the limpet. The slopes of the linear
regression lines for the three orientations were statistically indistinguishable by
an analysis of covariance (p-0.055).
The results of the 36-year heat-budget model show that the limpet living 2
m above MLLW nearly reached 37°C 3 times (Fig. 3). The limpet that lived only
1.5 m above MLLW saw a lower maximum temperature of about 35°0. When the
body temperature reaches these extreme temperatures, temperature is elevated
for a long period of time, as much as 5 hours above 30°0.
For the theoretical limpet 2 m above MLLW, the frequency of encountering
a thermal event greater than 30°C for just ten minutes is greater than once per
year (Fig. 4). The frequency decreases steadily as the period of the thermal
event increases. For the limpet 1.5 m above MLLW, the probability of a 10-
minute thermal event above 30°C is barely half that of the limpet living only 50
