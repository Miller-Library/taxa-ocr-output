distribution as well as preferred substrate for egg laying. In addition to the
distributional findings, this study has pointed out further questions, eg. is
the number of egg cases in Monterey Bay declining? Also addressed is the
possibility of predation of the egg case ocurring in nature.
INTRODUCTION:
The brown cat shark Apristurus brunneus is a benthic shark found
in eastern Pacific waters from depths of 200 to over 1000 meters,
documented as high as 200 meters above the bottom (Geen and Jones,
1976; Roedel, 1950; DeLacy and Chapman, 1935). It is known that this
shark lives in or near the Monterey Bay due to sightings, sharks caught on
lines and in trawlls, and more frequently, sightings and samplings of its
egg cases. Very little is known about A.brunneus since it was impossible
to study live specimens of deep sea organisms such as this until recently.
MBARI (see Appendix 1) and its unmanned submersible, the ROV
Ventana, along with others like it, have provided most of the material for
education about this animal.
Gilbert Van Dykhuizen, Senior Aquarist at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium, has been studying this shark, among others, for nearly six
years. His most recent focus has been on its embryonic development;
something which had not been studied in this organism previously. The
focus of my research was to find the preferred habitat and distribution of
this cat shark egg in Monterey Bay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
General: Distributional research was conducted at MBARI, through
videos taken over a three year period from March 1989 until March 1992.
These findings are based on contact and recordings made with the ROV.
Later studies on egg case predation was conducted in the Deeps Sea lab at
the Monterey Bay Aquarium under the guidance of Gilbert Van
Dykhuizen, Senior Aquarist.
Sightings: Distribution was determined using the number of
sightings rather than the number of egg cases present in each sighting.
Most footage of A.brunneus egg cases shows the communal sites, where a
number of females have chosen the same site for egg laying, while others
show only one or two egg cases. Over all, the number of eggs found in
communal sites is far greater than the number of individual egg cases
sighted.
Multiple sightings within one dive were counted if and only if it
could be determined that there was no possibility of counting the same egg
case twice. This is to say that two sightings one minute apart but at the
same depth (within one meter of each other) and presumably in or on the
same substrate in the same area would be counted as one. It is quite
common for the ROV to lose and then regain sight of the same egg case,
and often difficult to prove either way.
Bottom Time: Bottom time is based upon the number of video
tapes of a given length recorded during a dive. All benthic dives have had
one hour subtracted from their total tape time to account for average
ascent and descent time.
Substrate: Substrate categories for the purposes of this study are:
rock, sponge, and miscellaneous. Often, the substrate type is too difficult
to determine solely from video.
Depth: Depth categories are broken down into 25 meter intervals.
This division is arbitrary; selected for its ease.
RESULTS:
Sightings: Between March, 1989,when the first sighting of an
A.brunneus egg case was reported by MBART's ROV, and March, 1992
there have been 304 individual sightings of cat shark egg cases. Of these,
119 were in 1989, 142 were in 1990, 35 were in 1991 and so far only 8 have
been in 1992. See Figure 1.
Bottom Time: Bottom time on benthic dives ranged from just a few
minutes to 1710 minutes. See Figure 2.
Depth: Based upon the depth readings reported by the ROV,
A.brunneus has a preferential range for laying its eggs. Though found in
depths from 151 meters to 525 meters, there is an overwhelming
abundance of egg cases from nearly 326 meters to 450 meters, with a
remarkable preference for the interval of 351 meters to 375 meters. See
Figure 4.
Substrate: Of the 86 sightings with determined substrates, ten were
on rock outcroppings, 64 were on various types of sponges, and 12 were on
miscellaneous substrates ranging from anemones to sessile debris to the
sediment slope. See Figure 5.
DISCUSSION:
The frequency of sightings of the egg case from A.brunneus seems
to depict two patterns. One of these is the decreasing number of sightings
since 1990. This may or may not be an accurate conclusion to draw from
my observations. It is certainly possible that, for one reason or another,
this species of shark is not thriving in Monterey Bay now, but it seems
more likely that the results herein reported are biased by the conditions of
ROV dives.
MBARI has been trying to increase the maximum operating depth
of the ROV since its origins. Recent capabilities allow the ROV to descend
to 1000 meters whereas the maximum depth it could reach began at 500
meters and slowly decreased until it was replaced with the current tether
in September 1990. However, MBARI did not have the capacity to make
use of the long tether until the program for tether management was
entirely operational in January 1991. When compared to the depth
stratification of this cat shark egg we can see that by doing less benthic
research in 200 - 400 meter depths one would see fewer egg cases. See
figure 3.
The other pattern that can be expected to be seen is a cyclic one.
Past research has shown the ovulation period of the Apristurus brunneus
to be highest in February and March and decline until its end as late as
August (Geen and Jones, 1976). These findings were based on specimens
caught in British Columbia coastal waters. Perhaps the greatest reason
why this pattern isn't observed in the ROV's sightings is because the
results shown here concern egg cases of different ages and developmental
progress, whereas other research conducted discusses egg cases not yet
released by the mother. The egg cases seen by the ROV, especially in
communal sites, are often old and already hatched. There is no
specification of the number of fresh egg cases.
Another major reason any patterns which may seem obvious are
false is that it is difficult to consider the opportunities provided by ROV as
constraints on the research. During months when no benthic dives were
conducted it is obvious that no egg cases could be sighted. Äfter the tether
was replaced and the amount of time spent on and depth of benthic dives
could be increased there is another explanation for the lack of egg case
sightings; the ROV was simply too deep to see any. A closer look at
frequency patterns could be taken if the ROV had a fixed bottom time per
month in a given area known for communal egg laying sites, and by
attempting to measure the developmental stage of the embryos it
encounters as well as the number of dead or old egg cases.
Regardless of these restrictions, the data from the ROV enabled me
to get a clear picture of the boundaries of the depth stratifications of the
A.brunneus egg in Monterey Bay. Studies have reported distribution of
the adult cat shark in British Columbia waters (Geen and Jones, 1976), off
the coast of California (Roedel, 1950), and in the Puget Sound (DeLacy and
Chapman, 1935), but never in the Bay and never concentrating on the egg
case itself. In order to use these findings more extensively, this
information could be followed by a study of the distribution of the adult
cat shark in the Bay, or of egg distribution elsewhere. Mysteriously, the
ROV has very few documented sightings of mature A.brunneus in the
Bay. Now that there are communal egg laying sites documented and the
embryonic development has been explored (Van Dykhuizen, ongoing) it
would be interesting to research the whereabouts of those who laid these
eggs as well as where these juveniles go after exiting their case.
Another interesting direction for further investigation might be
why sponges are the preferred substrate for egg case laying. It can be seen,
through ROV videos, that the egg cases have a detrimental effect on
sponges, and large deposits of egg cases smother the sponge upon which
they are laid. One possibile explanation deals with the relationship
between the community near the sponge and the developing embryo.
Since the area is productive, there is a great deal of interaction between the
organisms and the egg case. It is possible that this is advantageous to a
newly released juvenile shark.
Perhaps the greatest question raised by this research deals with
predation of the eggs. It has been seen through sightings and samples that
many of the eggs have holes in them. There seem to be two types of holes
commonly found in the egg cases. One is small (1 to 5 mm in diameter)
and round with smooth edges and usually found on the face of an egg
case, the other is larger (up to 10 mm) and uneven in shape with rough
edges (see Figures 6A and 6B). It is possible that the latter of these holes is
simply the former after given a substantial amount of decay time.
By studying the organisms commonly associated with the
A.brunneus egg case we can create a list of possible predators which
include the deep sea stars <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Stylasterias : Exact'>Stylasterias</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Rathbunaster : Exact'>Rathbunaster</span> as well as
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Allocentrotus : Exact'>Allocentrotus,</span> a deep sea urchin, and a number of predatory snails
including <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Neptunea amianta : Exact'>Neptunea amianta,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Neptunea ithia : Exact'>Neptunea ithia,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Colus : Exact'>Colus,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Caliostoma : Exact'>Caliostoma.</span>
Brief experiments were conducted in the Monterey Bay Aquarium
wherein a few of one type of the possible predators were set in a small tank
with two cat shark eggs which were affixed to a rock. Though in the lab
none of the predators ate their way into the egg, it is believed that, in a
more extensive study of this, some of these organisms would prey upon
the cat shark egg. In fact, Caliostoma has been observed doing just that in
Van Dykhuizen's lab (unpublished, pers. comm.).
Finally, if the frequency of sightings is decreasing due to the
existence of fewer eggs we may face a major decline in the local population
of Apristurus brunneus. This shark is only present off the western coast of
North America, from British Columbia to southern California (Geen and
Jones, 1976) and (Roedel, 1950). If the population in Monterey Bay is being
destroyed by predation upon its eggs, how are we to know that this is not
ocurring elsewhere? At the very least, the population genetics of this
species would be greatly altered by the disappearance of this, a central rung
on its ladder.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I would like to thank the entire staff of MBARI, especially Lynn
Lewis for her guidance with the videos and all those who may have been
inconvenienced by my moving in to the video room for many late nights.
My other second home these past weeks became the Monterey Bay
Aquarium and I certainly owe many thanks to everyone who helped me
out there, especially Teri Buroker for her warm smiles and Gilbert Van
Dykuizen not only for loaning me space in his lab, but for always
encouraging me and somehow knowing when to give me advice and
when the best advice was for me to come up with my own answers. I
want to thank everyone I have gotten to know at Hopkins Marine Station,
and even those whom I never officially met. I have never been around a
more dynamic group of people and I only hope I brought to them half of
what they gave me: David Epel, Mark Denny, Alan Baldridge, Susan
Harris, Judy Thompson, and everyone else (especially my six and one half
roommates). Finally, I extend a warm thank you to Chuck Baxter without
whom I wouldn't have the courage to follow my dreams.
APPENDIX 1:
MBARI is the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute which
was founded in 1987 with the intention of expanding marine research by
developing "better equipment, instrumentation, systems and methods for
scientific research in the deep waters of the ocean." It is an independent,
non-profit institution for research and education comprised of scientists
and engineers. The chief expeditionary resources are a 110 foot research

The X axis of this graph is divided into months beginning
with January 1989 and ending with March 1992. This indicates the
frequency of sightings throughout the ROV's operational time.
Figure 2: Bottom Time per Month.
This figure shows the approximate time the ROV spent on
benthic dives, at any depth. As indicated above, the months begin with
January 1989 and end with March 1992.
Figure 3: Bottom Time and Egg Case Sightings per Month.
Figure 3 correlates Figures 1 and 2; it allows us to judge the
number of sightings in comparison with the amount of time possible for
sightings. Note that the number of minutes was decreased by a power of
ten to fit on a scale with the number of egg cases sighted. The inaccuracy
created by the change in scale is great; this chart is only presented to enable
the reader to view the two above charts simultaneously.
