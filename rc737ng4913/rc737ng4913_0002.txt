INTRODUCTION
A growing awareness of environmental pollution has led
to recent attempts to evaluate the biological impact of local
domestic sewage discharges into Monterey Bay. One of these
studies (Holstrom, 1970) showed an effect on the stalked
barnacle Pollicipes polymerus, a natural and abundant inter-
tidal organism along the central California coast. Holstrom
found that samples of populations adjacent to sewage outfalls
had reduced reproductive capabilities. He also noted a
qualitative difference in the amounts of carotenoid pigments
in the animals, including an apparent total lack of
astaxanthin, astaxanthin ester, and lutein in animals from
highly polluted areas. This mutual effect on reproduction
and on carotenoid content seemed to be linked to levels of
chlorination rather than to any other factor.
These apparent effects on carotenoid content are most
intriguing in light of recent thoughts concerning the rela-
tionship of carotenoids to reproduction in marine invertebrates
(Cheesman et al., 1967). Some of the carotenoids in the
animal, especially astaxanthin, are found as lipoprotein
complexes (Holter, 1969). Glyco-lipoprotein complexes, which
have been noted in the blood of many invertebrates, may be
involved in the transport of carotenoids (Cheesman et al.,
1967). Likewise, a carotenoid attached to a lipoprotein could
possibly mediate the transport of large water-soluble mole-
cules across lipid-bound membranes (Holter, 1969). Such
properties would be importantat the onset of reproduction
