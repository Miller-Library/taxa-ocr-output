Generally the amount of pigment in both the stalk fluid
and the ovaries of these offshore samples increases as the
distance south of the outfall (station 1) increases, although
the levels at station  are consistently low. Th relative
amounts of individual pigments present show no definite
trend as they appeared to in the Point Pinos samples.
Inshore: The stalk fluid from all of these animals was
bright orange although station 1 and 2 animals did not
have many developed ovaries and only station 5 animals
had ovigerous lamellae. The amounts of pigments in the
stalk fluid of station 1,2, andl animals was low (close
to the level L animals in the offshore samples). The
stalk fluid pigment level for station 5 animals was
very high, 6 times the amount at 1, 2, and  and second
only to the levels obtained for animals from Sea Otter
Point (Fig. 3). The total amount of pigment in the ovaries
was lowest for station  as was the amount of stalk fluid
pigment. The value for station 1, in the area of the pipe,
was about 6 times the value for the other inshore stations.
There was not enough pigment to obtain values for the indi-
vidual pigments.
Others: Animals from White's Point had bright orange stalk
fluid although only 3 in 60 had well developed ovaries and
no ovigerous lamellae. The amount of pigment in the stalk
fluid was low, 33.6ug/ml, close to the value obtained at the
Carmel inshore station 1. The amount of pigment in the
ovaries was close to that in animals from area C at Point
