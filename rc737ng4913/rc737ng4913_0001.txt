ABSTRACT
1. Qualitative studies of reproduction and quantitative
studies of total and individual carotenoid content in
the stalked barnacle Pollicipes polymerus were carried
out for animals in polluted and nonpolluted areas in the
Monterey Bay area of California.
2. Reproductive activity was retarded in areas very close
to point sources of pollution.
3. The total carotenoid content in the stalk fluid of
Pollicipes was invariably lowest in animals close to point
sources of pollution, concomitantly, the amount of carotenoid
tended to increase with increasing distance from such pollution
sources.
1. It was suggested that total carotenoid content may be
fected by proximity to sewage effluent whereas astaxanthin
content may be specifically effected by increas√©d chlorine
concentrations.
5. Possible mechanisms governing the decrease in Pollicipes
carotenoid content are discussed.
