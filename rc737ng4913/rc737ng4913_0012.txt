Pinos.
The sample from Highlands Inn appeared to be the health-
iest of all the samples collected. The fluid was bright
orange and almost every animal had a well developed ovary.
However, the values for total amount of pigment were very low
for both the stalk fluid (close to the value at White's
Point and station 1 in the inshore Carmel series) and the
ovaries (close to the value at station L in the inshore
Carmel series). Lutein was the most abundant pigment, amount-
ing to 60% of the total pigment.
Few of the animals from Mussel Point had well developed
ovaries. The stalk fluid was a dull orange. The amount of
pigment in the stalk fluid was close to station C at Point
Pinos in May (Fig. 3). The amount of pigment in the ovaries
was highest of any of the samples collected. Astaxanthin
(44%) and lutein (55%) were almost equally abundant.
The animals from Sea Otter Point were healthy with
bright orange stalk fluid,many developed ovaries, and ovi-
gerous lamellae. The amount of pigment in the stalk fluid
was higher than any of the other samples collected. The
amount of pigment in the ovaries was slightly higher than
that found at station B in May at Point Pinos.
The animals from the cannery appeared healthy, with
bright orange stalk fluid, many developed ovaries, and ovi-
gerous lamellae in the later sample. However the amount of
pigment in the stalk fluid was close to the levels taken in
May at stations B and C at Point Pinos. The amount of
