Point Pinos
The two Point Pinos samples taken in April and May
each contained subsamples taken from three locations (Fig.1):
area P, within 20 yards of the pipe and highly polluted;
area B, a moderately polluted area west of the pipe; and
area C, a slightly polluted area south of the pipe.
Both samples from area P consisted of undersized
individuals with rostro-carinal distances of 15-20mm(17.2mm
is minimum size for reproduction; Hilgard, 1960). The average
range encountered in all healthy populations was 25-35 mm.
These animals all had yellow-gray stalk fluid as compared
to the usual bright orange color. Few had developed ovaries
and none had ovigerous lamellae. In both the April and
May samples the amount of total pigment in the stalk fluid
(Fig.3) was well below that found in the samples taken from
areas B and C. The total pigment in the ovaries was comparable
to that found in all other Point Pinos samples. The most
abundant stalk fluid pigment in the April sample taken
from area P (Fig.5) was lutein, which amounted to 74% of
the total pigment complement of the animals.
The samples from area B appeared healthy and had
bright orange stalk fluid. Many had developed ovaries
and ovigerous lamellae. The amount of pigment in the stalk
fluid of both samples (Fig. 3) was approximately six times
the amount of pigment in area P animals and 0.75 times the
amount in area C animals. The amount of pigment in the
