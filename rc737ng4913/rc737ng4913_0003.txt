when there is a transfer of nutrient materials to the egg.
The blue pigment in the ovaries and developing embryos of
Lepas fasicularis is a carotenoprotein with astaxanthin
attached to euglobulin (Ball, 1944). Ball showed that
developing nauplii change their color from blue to pink,
representing the liberation of free astaxanthin from the
protein complexes. Such phenomena are quite common in
marine invertebrates (Cheesman et al., 1967). Recently
suggestions have been made that these huge protein complexes
may be food storage sites for early developmental stages
(Zagalsky et al, 1967). The carotenoids are thought to
stabilize the glyco-lipid proteins and the organism in
question somehow frees these carotenoids, allowing the
proteins to be utilized (Cheesman et al., 1967). The eggs
of Pollicipes polymerus chang from an orange color to a
brown color as they mature. However Lee and Gilchrist (1971)
have found that a similar color chang in the sand crab,
Emerita analoga, is strictly chromataphoric.
Unextracted stalk fluid from Pollicipes polymerus in
highly polluted areas is yellow-gray, as opposed to the
bright orange color found in animals from unpolluted areas.
This yellow-gray color could be the result of interference
with either the synthesis of carotenoids, namely astaxanthin,
or the formation of a stable linkage between carotenoids and
proteins.
An investigaton of the quantitative effects of sewage
pollution on the pigments of Pollicipes polymerus is made
easier by a recent study by Holter (1969) describing the
