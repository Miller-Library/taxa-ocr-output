Barnacles were collected at six sites along the Carmel-
Monterey coastline (Fig. 1 and 2) and one site in Southern
California. The areas were as follows: (1) the Pacific
Grove sewage outfall area at Point Pinos (3 stations),
on April 28th and May 27th, 1971; (2) the Carmel sewage
outfall area north of Monastary Beach (5 offshore stations
and  inshore stations);(3) Mussel Point; (4) Hovden
cannery, north of Mussel Point, on April 29th and May 6th,
1971; (5) Sea Otter Point, approximately Â½ mile south
of the mouth of Malpaso Creek along California Highway
No. 1; (6) the Highlands Inn outfall at Carmel Highlands
south of Point Lobos; (7) White's Point on the south side of
the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Southern California, directly
inshore of the Los Angeles County sewage outfall.
The number of animals collected at each of these
sitesranged from 30 to 65 (Table 1).
The areas were selected to represent highly polluted
areas: Point Pinos; Carmel; White's Point, areas polluted
by relatively small discharges: Highlands Inn, and unpolluted
areas: Hovden cannery, Mussel Point, Sea Otter Point.
The white to orange ovaries and the orange to
yellow-gray stalk fluid of the Pollicipes polymerus were
used for measuring carotenoid content as Holter (1969)
showed these two tissues to be the highest in carotenoid
content. Stalk fluid was collected by cutting whole clumps
