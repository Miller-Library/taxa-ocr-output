ovaries, however, was the highest recorded for any of the
Point Pinos samples and almost equivalent to the amount of
pigment found in the ovaries of animals collected from
unpolluted sites such as Sea Otter Point (Fig. 1). The
most abundant pigment in samples from area B was astaxanthin
which amounted to 66% of the total.
The two area C samples appeared healthy although there
were hardly any ovigerous lamellae seen in the individuals
collected. These animals consistently had the highest amount
of pigment in the stalk fluid as compared to the other
Point Pinos samples (Fig. 3), and, in the ovaries, more
pigment than individuals from area P but less pigment than
individuals from area B (Fig.4). Similar to the results
obtained from area B, the most abundant pigment in the
April stalk fluid samples was astaxanthin, amounting to
61% of the total carotenoid content.
In both April and May there appeared to be a
definite gradient in the amount of pigment in the stalk
fluid relative to the proximity of sewage effluent. The
pigment in the ovaries however, did not show such a gradient.
The predominant pigment in the animals that appeared healthy
(areas B and C) was astaxanthin, while lutein was clearly
dominant in the unhealthy animals (area P), almost fully
replacing the astaxanthin in relative per cent.
