of barnacles from the rocks and allowing the stalk fluid to
drain. The stalk fluid and the animals from which it was
obtained were immediately placed on ice and transported
to the laboratory as soon as possible. The animals were
then dissected and the ovaries removed. The stalk fluid
was centrifuged at 10,000 R.P.M. for 20 minutes to remove
particulate matter. Acetone was added to both the fluid and
the ovaries and they were refrigerated up to 12 hours until
needed.
Extraction of Carotenoids
The ovaries and stalk fluid were extracted in acetone
and transferred to di-ethyl ether, saponified, and re-
dissolved in di-ethyl ether according to the methods of
Lee (1966). Before saponification the extract was transferred
to petroleum ether (B.P. 20-1000) and the absorption spectra
(500-130 nm) of the extracted carotenoids determined with a
Beckman DB-G gradiant spectrophotometer. These readings
were used to calculate total carotenoid content by
applying the formula:
ug carotenoids/mg ovary
- 1 X OD at peak x volume extracted
or
original amount
ml fluid
Pigment Identification
The extracted pigments were applied to 20x20 and
5x20 Mannogram prepared silica gel-G thin layer chromatography
plates. The plates were run in a mixture of 25% acetone
in hexane. The separate bands were then scraped off the
plates into a mixture of 10% acetone in petroleum ether
