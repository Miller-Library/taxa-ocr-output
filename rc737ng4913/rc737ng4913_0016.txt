complement of the animals.
It was hoped that a quantitative study of the indivi-
dual pigments would show some kind of relationship between
amount of sewage pollution and relative abundance of BÂ¬
carotene, astaxanthin, and lutein. However, the data
obtained allows no such correlations to be made and appears
to be inadequate. This was brought about by the fact that
the amount of pigment in the individual Pollicipes polymerus
is very small and it is therefore difficult to obtain
a good working volume of extract. Furthermore, astaxanthin,
the major pigment in Pollicipes, is very labile and is
readily oxidized even after extreme precautions have been
taken.
The mechanisms which bring about the changes in the
amounts of total pigment are unknown. They may be due to
replacement of carotenoids and carotenoid precursors in
the diet of Pollicipes polymerus by non-nutrient containing
particulate matter from the effluent; they may be due to
some substance in the effluent which effects the biochemical
processes of pigment production; or they may be due to
denaturation of the protein structures, specifically the
stalk fluid and egg carotenoproteins, also by some substance
in the effluent.
Whatever the mechanism, sewage pollution appears
to have a definite measurable effect on total carotenoid
levels in Pollicipes polymerus.
