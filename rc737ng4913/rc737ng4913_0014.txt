DISCUSSION
Tth results of this study coincide in part with
Holstrom's (1970) observations of decreased reproductive
capability in Pollicipes polymerus occurring in the areas of
concentrated sewage pollution.
Quantitatively, the levels of total carotenoid
pigment in the stalk fluid, and less consistently in the
ovaries, suggest that carotenoid pigments are somehow
adversely effected by the sewage effluent. The data from
Point Pinos shows the most obvious correlations. The area
where the effluent is most concentrated (sample area P)
shows evidence of decreased reproduction and a definite
drop in carotenoid pigments in the stalk fluid as compared
to the pigment in the animals from the healthier areas.
The amount of pigment in the ovaries suggest a similar trend,
although here is is not as marked or as consistent. There
is some indication that astaxanthin in the polluted areas
may decrease with a concomitant increase in lutein.
The data from Carmel does not give as clear a picture,
possibly because the currents around the outfall have
been shown to be very complicated
Chlorine residues at Carmel have been measured at
1-2 ppm whereas those at Point Pinos have been measured
as high as 10 ppm. This greater amount of chlorine input
at Point Pinos may explain the more definitive results
here as compared with the Carmel stations, although the
stalk fluid pigments at some Carmel sites seemed to be just
