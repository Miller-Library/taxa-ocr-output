and the absorption spectrum was again determined and the
amounts of the individual pigments were calculated as
outlined above. These individual pigments were identified
by the wavelength of maximum absorbance in petroleum ether
and by comparison with pigment standards which were also
applied to TLC plates and run under the same conditions.
The sources of these standards were identical to those
reported in Lee and Gilchrist (1971).
