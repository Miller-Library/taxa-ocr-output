as effected as those at Point Pinos. The carotenoid levels
in the ovaries from Point Pinos and Carmel were generally
similar. The amount of pigment in the ovaries at inshore
station 1 seemed inordinately high. A possible explanation
may be related to local current patterns. Polluted water
from the outfall sweeping back towards shore (Fig. 2) may
miss station 1. The values for the offshore stations,
however, show a more consistent pattern with a lower
amount of pigment being found in the areas closest to
the outfall.
These observations tend to support Holstrom's contentions
that decrease in reproductive capability may be linked to
a decrease in total amount of pigment. However, the only
consistent change in the proportions of the individual
pigments takes place in the Point Pinos samples where there
is a larger concentration of chlorine in the water.
It therefore may be suggested that increased chlorination
may directly effect the oxidation of astaxanthin, whereas
unchlorinated or minimally chlorinated effluent may effect
total carotenoid content. It was found that if a sample
were left at room temperature or refrigerated for 18
hours it would turn yellow-gray and show a decreased
amount of total pigment. This seems to indicate that dena-
turing the proteins in the stalk fluid effectsthe carotenoid
level by maximizing the opportunity for oxidation. This in
turn could mean that the sewage effluent is effecting the
protein and therefore secondarily altering the pigment
